Donald Trump wrongly says Hillary Clinton 'wants to go to a single-payer plan' for health care
","Donald Trump called the Affordable Care Act a ""disaster"" that he wants to repeal and that Hillary Clinton would make health care even worse. ""She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster,"" Trump said during the presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis Oct. 9. ""Somewhat similar to Canada. And if you ever noticed the Canadians -- when they need a big operation when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow, it's catastrophic in certain ways. But, she wants to go to single payer which means the government basically rules everything."" Does Clinton want to move the United States to a single-payer system for health care? Clinton’s health care plan  Converting Obamacare to a single-payer program would make it, like Medicare, a federal health insurance program run by the federal government. Under a single-payer system, the government provides health care for everyone. Currently, Obamacare promotes policies supplied by private insurance companies. Some Democrats — including, at one time, Barack Obama — pushed for a single-payer system. But there wasn’t enough support for that, and ultimately Congress approved a plan that allows different insurance plans offered in ""marketplaces"" by individual states and the federal government. During the vice presidential debate, Trump’s running mate Gov. Mike Pence made a similar claim that Clinton and and Tim Kaine ""want to expand (Obamacare) into a single-payer program."" We rated that claim Mostly False. For our fact-check of Pence, Trump spokesman Dan Kowalski pointed us to the health care page on Clinton's website. It indicates ""that she supports a 'public option' for Obamacare,"" Kowalski said. ""A 'public option' is a single-payer-like option for health care delivery."" Here is exactly what she said on her campaign website about a public option: ""Defend and expand the Affordable Care Act, which covers 20 million people. Hillary will stand up to Republican-led attacks on this landmark law—and build on its success to bring the promise of affordable health care to more people and make a ""public option"" possible. She will also support letting people over 55 years old buy into Medicare."" So Clinton does want a public option, but she is calling for adding the public option to the existing options. Clinton has consistently said, including during the Oct. 9 debate, that she wants to protect Obamacare from being repealed by the Republicans. She has called for expanding it to include tax credits, eliminating the out-of-network hospital charges many plans levy, and reducing prescription drug costs by removing the ban that prevents the federal government from negotiating drug prices and allowing Americans to important their drugs from countries with cheaper prices. We previously asked the Trump campaign if they had seen any statements from Clinton or Kaine indicating that converting Obamacare into a single-payer system was their eventual goal. Kowalski responded that ""Hillary has committed fully to the public option,"" and as evidence he directed us to comments Clinton made in 1994 when she was first lady. At the time, she predicted that if Congress didn't pass health care reform soon, ""I believe, and I may be totally off base on this, but I believe that by the year 2000 we will have a single-payer system. I don’t think it’s — I don’t even think it’s a close call politically."" Later in her answer Clinton says there are three ways to get universal health coverage, only one of which is a single-payer system. The other two: an employer mandate or an individual mandate, which is how Obamacare works. WikiLeaks speech excerpt about single-payer A few days after the vice presidential debate, WikiLeaks published emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. A Jan. 25 email from Clinton campaign research director Tony Carrk to Podesta contained excerpts of Clinton’s paid speeches to Wall Street banks. (For months Clinton has faced calls to release the speeches but hasn’t done so.) One excerpt related to single-payer systems was from remarks she gave to ""ECGR Grand Rapids"" on June 17, 2013. She gave a speech to the Economic Club of Grand Rapids in Michigan that day. ""If you look at countries that are comparable, like Switzerland or Germany, for example, they have mixed systems. They don't have just a single-payer system, but they have very clear controls over budgeting and accountability. If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here."" We can’t fully evaluate Clinton’s speech because WikiLeaks published only excerpts. (We asked the Clinton campaign for a fully copy but did not get a response to that request.) However, Clinton praised single-payer because she says it keeps costs down, but she also said that it imposes wait times. And she also praised systems like Switzerland for having clear budget controls and said they don’t have single payer. Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin sent us a brief fact-check in Politico that was headlined: ""No, Clinton has not been after single payer for years."" One final note: Trump has been all over the map on single-payer health care if we trace his comments back to his first race for president in 2000. ""The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than America. … We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing,"" Trump wrote in his 2000 book The America We Deserve. Other times in the past couple of years he has praised it, but he has also said he doesn’t support it. His campaign plan on his website emphasizes ""free market principles."" Our ruling Trump says Clinton ""wants to go to a single-payer plan"" for health care. She has consistently said she would fight efforts to repeal Obamacare and would try to improve it. She said she wants a public option to be ""possible"" but she has not  called for moving to a system of only single payer. Clinton has not called for a single-payer plan. At times, she has praised the health care systems of other countries that have a single-payer plan, but she has not advocated that plan for the United States.

Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails after getting a subpoena
","The FBI concluded that Hillary Clinton should not be prosecuted over her decision to conduct State Department business exclusively over a private email server, but Donald Trump pledged to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the matter if he becomes president. At the second debate between the two presidential nominees, Trump criticized Clinton for turning over half her emails held on her server to the State Department and deleting the rest. He said Clinton should be ""ashamed"" of herself for deleting 33,000 emails. ""There has never been anything like this,"" Trump said at the Oct. 9 event in St. Louis. ""You get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena you delete 33,000 emails."" Clinton and her campaign don’t dispute that she deleted these 33,000 emails. They argue that these were personal in nature, rather than work-related, and therefore were not necessary to turn over. However, they have denied that they deleted the emails after receiving a congressional subpoena from the House Select Committee on Benghazi on March 4, 2015. But an August 2016 FBI report on its investigation shows that Trump’s claim has some merit. Let’s take a look at the timeline of relevant events, according to the FBI report. (The most pertinent information is on pages 15-19 of this document.) Feb. 1, 2013: Clinton serves her last day as secretary of state. July 23, 2014: The State Department reaches an agreement with the Benghazi committee about producing records for its investigation into the 2012 attack on a U.S. embassy in the Libyan city. Oct. 28, 2014: The State Department sends an official letter to Clinton’s staff requesting ""emails related to their government work."" Clinton’s lawyer, David Kendall, and aide Cheryl Mills oversaw the review of Clinton’s email archives to produce work-related documents to the department. Dec. 5, 2014: Clinton’s team provides 55,000 pages of emails, or about 30,000 individual emails, to the State Department. Mills tells an employee at Platte River Networks, which managed the server, that Clinton does not need to retain any emails older than 60 days. March 2, 2015: The New York Times breaks the story that Clinton used a personal email account while secretary of state. March 4, 2015: The Benghazi committee issues a subpoena requiring Clinton to turn over all emails from her private server related to the incident in Libya. Between March 25-31, 2015: The Platte River Networks employee has what he calls an ""oh s---"" moment, realizing he did not delete Clinton’s email archive, per Mills’ December 2014 request. The employee deletes the email archive using a software called BleachBit. March 27, 2015: Clinton’s lawyers send a letter to the Benghazi committee saying that the State Department already has the relevant emails, as they were included in the Dec. 5, 2014, turnover. Trump’s timeline is correct. The congressional subpoena came on March 4, 2015, and an employee deleted the emails sometime after March 25, 2015, three weeks later. However, the implication — that Clinton deleted emails relevant to the subpoena in order to avoid scrutiny — is unprovable if not flat wrong. The FBI’s investigation did find several thousand emails among those deleted that were work-related and should have been turned over to the State Department. However, FBI Director James Comey said in a July 2016 statement that the FBI investigation ""found no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them."" Comey added in a later congressional hearing that the FBI learned no one on Clinton’s staff specifically asked the employee to delete the emails following the New York Times story and subpoena. Rather, the employee made that decision on his own. Clinton told the FBI that she did was not involved in deciding whether individual emails should be sent to State Department, nor ""did she instruct anyone to delete her emails to avoid complying with FOIA, State or FBI requests for information."" Our ruling Trump said, ""You (Hillary Clinton) get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena you delete 33,000 emails."" Clinton’s staff received a subpoena for Benghazi-related emails March 4. An employee managing her server deleted 33,000 of Clinton’s emails three weeks later. The FBI found no evidence that the emails were deleted deliberately to avoid the subpoena or other requests. Clinton’s team requested for the emails to be deleted months before the subpoena came. They also argued that all the emails that would be relevant to the subpoena had already been turned over to the State Department.

Hillary Clinton says a record 90% of Americans have health insurance today
","During the second presidential debate in St. Louis, a member of the audience asked a question about the shortcomings of Obamacare, as the Affordable Care Act -- President Barack Obama’s signature health care law -- is sometimes called. In her answer, Hillary Clinton defended the law, citing its provisions to end barriers to obtaining insurance for those who have preexisting conditions, and ending lifetime limits on coverage. ""If we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody -- not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange,"" she said. ""And then we would have to start all over again."" She went on to say that the practical consequences of the law have been strong. ""Now we're at 90 percent health insurance coverage,"" she said. ""That's the highest we've ever been in our country."" Is she correct? Yes. The most widely cited data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau, which tabulates statistics annually on what percentage of Americans are covered by health insurance. The most recent report came out in September 2016, covering the year 2015. The Census Bureau found that 90.9 percent of Americans had some type of health coverage, whether it was provided by their employer, purchased independently or through a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The remainder -- 9.1 percent of Americans -- were uninsured. Here’s the key table from the report:  That was an improvement over the 89.6 percent in 2014, 86.7 percent in 2013, 84.6 percent in 2012, 84.3 percent in 2011, and 83.7 percent in 2010 -- the year the Affordable Care Act was passed, although the law didn’t start having a major impact for another few years. Meanwhile, between 1999 and 2009, the insured rate bounced from a low of 83.9 percent to a high of 86.9 percent, the furthest back the Census Bureau offers the statistic online. And at the time the 2015 data was released, it was framed as a record high for insurance coverage. Looking at it the opposite way, the uninsured rate fell from 16.3 percent in 2010 to 9.1 percent in 2015 -- a decline of nearly half over five years. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Right now we are at 90 percent health insurance covered. That's the highest we've ever been in our country."" According to Census Bureau data, that’s correct; it was just shy of 91 percent in 2015, the most recent year for which data is available.

Donald Trump has no 'fiduciary responsibility' on his personal tax returns, experts say
","In response to a New York Times article dissecting leaked pages from his tax returns, Donald Trump’s presidential campaign released a statement that sought to justify Trump’s efforts to keep his personal income taxes low. The Times article followed months of refusal by Trump to release his tax returns, something that all presidential candidates since 1980 have done. The paper reported that a $916 million loss could have enabled Trump to cancel out earned income in other years, enough to legally pay no personal federal income tax for up to 18 years. The Trump campaign’s unsigned statement argued in part that Trump had an obligation to pay the lowest amount of taxes possible. ""Mr. Trump is a highly skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,’ the statement said in part. But does Trump have a ""fiduciary responsibility"" to pay as little as possible in personal income taxes? Most experts agreed that no such responsibility exists. (Trump’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Let’s start with defining what ""fiduciary responsibility"" means. The most basic definition of fiduciary responsibility is a legal obligation of one party to act in the best interests of another. (There are other types of fiduciary relationships than economic ones -- such as attorneys to their clients, priests to their parishioners and doctors to their patients -- but we’ll set those aside here.) In a business setting, fiduciary obligation most often refers to the principle that a company’s management has a responsibility to act in the best interests of those who own the company -- its stockholders. There’s some disagreement about how this principle should be put into practice -- for instance, should a company maximize its short-term income regardless of the risks that doing so could carry for the long-term success of the company? In general, though, the overarching principle is considered fairly straightforward: A company’s manager is under an obligation to put shareholders’ interests ahead of his or her own personal financial interests. This principle is commonly followed in the business world. But most experts we contacted said that while the fiduciary principle would govern how a company pays its taxes, it would not apply to Trump’s personal tax return. ""The general view is that corporate law imposes a fiduciary responsibility on company managers to maximize company profits on behalf of the company’s owners,"" said Dennis Caplan, associate professor of accounting at the University at Albany. That means that if Trump managed a company owned by others, he’d have an obligation to minimize corporate taxes in order to maximize profits, he said. But that’s not the case for personal income tax returns -- and it is those returns that were leaked to the New York Times and that were the subject of the speculation about 18 tax-free years. ""I do not see how the taxes on his personal tax return would be relevant with respect to this particular fiduciary responsibility,"" Caplan said. Other experts agreed. Richard W. Painter, a University of Minnesota corporate law professor who was previously chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, told PolitiFact that ""one does not have fiduciary duty to other people, except perhaps a joint-filing spouse, when filing personal tax returns."" Painter added that there is also ""no such thing"" as a fiduciary duty to oneself. ""That’s called greed,"" he put it in an interview with the New York Times. ""And greed is not a component of the law of fiduciary duty anywhere."" The fiduciary responsibility argument is something that Trump is ""making up,"" said Daniel Shaviro, a professor of taxation at New York University Law School. ""No such responsibility would extend to his personal taxes, even if he were the CEO of a publicly traded company,"" he said. There’s a difference between tax evasion, which is illegal, and tax avoidance, which is legal, said Charles Elson, director of the University of Delaware's John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. He suspects that Trump was trying to echo this old piece of wisdom, but not successfully. The statement was not done in the ""most artfully crafted"" way, Elson said. At most, Trump might be able to argue that he has some fiduciary obligations to his employees, suggested Lawrence White, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. That would be arguable ""to the extent that any bankruptcy -- which might have arisen if he had not availed himself of these loss carry-forward/carry-back opportunities -- would have converted them into unsecured claimants for any delayed wages or other benefits,"" White said. However, that’s a ""novel"" argument untested in the courts, said University of Chicago Law School professor Daniel Hemel, writing in a Medium post. ""Employers generally have no fiduciary duties to their employees,"" Hemel wrote. Our ruling The statement from Trump’s campaign said he has ""a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required."" That might have been a credible argument if he were referring to his companies’ tax returns. But the statement was in response to controversy surrounding Trump’s personal tax returns. Experts we contacted said there is no generally accepted fiduciary obligation keep one’s own taxes low.    The statement is not accurate.

False: Ted Cruz claim that Hillary Clinton backs 'unlimited abortion' to moment of birth
","Ted Cruz of Texas stirred an Austin crowd by declaring that Hillary Clinton favors abortion without limit. The Republican senator characterized the Democratic presidential nominee’s position after an audience member at the September 2016 Texas Tribune Festival asked why the father of two young girls could support ""a candidate who is so openly misogynistic,"" referring to Cruz’s endorsement the day before of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Cruz stressed his concerns about entrusting Clinton with nominating Supreme Court justices who would, he said, threaten his daughters’ constitutional rights. When he paused, the audience member voiced another question: ""Like the right to choose?"" Cruz replied that the ""right to life"" needs to be protected, adding: ""I can also tell you even on the question of the right to life that the views of Hillary Clinton on abortion are radical and extreme. Her views: She supports unlimited abortion on demand up until the moment of birth, including partial-birth abortion, with taxpayer funding."" Unlimited to the moment of birth? Readers asked us to check this claim. For starters, it’s worth noting that abortions in the weeks leading up to birth are rare; 91 percent in 2012 occurred before the 14th week of pregnancy, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based reproductive health nonprofit. That year, the institute says, 1.3 percent took place in the 21st week or later. Notably too, as of October 2016, Texas ranked among 15 states to have proscribed abortion after about 20 weeks post-fertilization, the institute says.    It’s also so that abortions earlier in pregnancy aren’t always available on short notice. Twenty-eight states have statutory waiting periods for an abortion, PolitiFact Ohio noted in August 2016, and 14 states require physician counseling that necessitates two trips to a medical facility prior to an abortion. Clinton through the years And how does Clinton herself characterize her abortion position? We perused her own statements and one of her votes as a New York senator. A January 2016 ""fact sheet"" on her campaign website states that as president, Clinton will ensure the right to choose an abortion is protected, a reference to the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion. Also, the sheet says, Clinton will ""repeal the Hyde amendment to ensure low-income women have access to safe reproductive health care."" That's potentially a call for more federally funded abortions in that the Hyde amendment, regularly embraced by Congress since 1976, bars government funding of abortion through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or to save the health or life of the mother. According to a 2016 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, similar ""restrictions affect the appropriations for other federal entities, including the Department of Justice, where federal funds may not be used to perform abortions in the federal prison system, except in cases of rape or if the life of the mother would be endangered."" Hyde acts as a rider on federal appropriations bills. As such, PolitiFact Ohio noted in August 2016, it doesn’t have to be ""repealed"" to be deactivated. Bills on federal spending could just cease to include it. Some states have Hyde-like restrictions on their Medicaid dollars, and would have to change their guidelines to open an avenue to fund abortions if Hyde disappeared at the federal level. Clinton has long said that she’d support a late-term limit on abortion--provided it has exceptions. In 2003, as a senator for New York, Clinton was on the losing end of a 64-33 floor vote to advance the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 later signed into law by President George W. Bush. That change--barring physicians from knowingly performing intact dilation and extraction on a living fetus--had no exception to preserve the health or life of the woman. ""Clearly, the administration and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle see this as an opportunity to begin to eliminate Roe v. Wade,"" Clinton said at the time, according to an NPR news report, ""and the possibility of safe, legal and rare abortions in this country. And many young women don't seem to understand that this is not an option that they can take for granted."" Earlier, in an Oct. 8, 2000, candidate debate, Clinton said: ""I have said many times that I can support a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, so long as the health and life of the mother is protected. I’ve met women who faced this heart-wrenching decision toward the end of a pregnancy. Of course it’s a horrible procedure. No one would argue with that. But if your life is at stake, if your health is at stake, if the potential for having any more children is at stake, this must be a woman’s choice."" In March 2016, more recently, Bret Baier of Fox News asked Clinton during a Democratic presidential town hal whether she favors legal restrictions on abortion at any stage of pregnancy. That exchange: BAIER: ""Do you think a child should have any legal rights or protections before it’s born? Or do you think there should not be any restrictions on any abortions at any stage in a pregnancy?"" CLINTON: ""Well, again, let me put this in context, because it's an important question. Right now the Supreme Court is considering a decision that would shut down a lot of the options for women in Texas, and there have been other legislatures that have taken similar steps to try to restrict a woman's right to obtain an abortion. ""Under Roe v. Wade, which is rooted in the Constitution, women have this right to make this highly personal decision with their family in accordance with their faith, with their doctor. ""It's not much of a right if it is totally limited and constrained. ""So I think we have to continue to stand up for a woman's right to make these decisions, and to defend Planned Parenthood, which does an enormous amount of good work across our country."" BAIER: ""Just to be clear, there's no -- without any exceptions?"" CLINTON: ""No -- I have been on record in favor of a late pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother. ""I object to the recent effort in Congress to pass a law saying after 20 weeks, you know, no such exceptions, because although these are rare, Bret, they sometimes arise in the most complex, difficult medical situation."" BAIER: ""Fetal malformities and…"" CLINTON: ""And threats to the woman's health."" BAIER: ""Sure."" CLINTON: ""And so I think it is -- under Roe v. Wade, it is appropriate to say, in these circumstances, so long as there's an exception for the life and health of the mother."" Abortion at birth? When we inquired about the basis of Cruz’s claim, a Senate office spokesman, Phil Novack, said by email that the ruling in Roe v. Wade and another issued the same day in Doe v. Bolton meant from the start that a woman could obtain an abortion ""on demand"" up to giving birth. This intepretation presents as extremely permissive the court's stipulation that states may restrict abortion after fetal ""viability"" except ""where necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother."" Among analysts quoted by Novack, Michael Paulsen of the University of St. Thomas School of Law wrote in 2003 that it’s ""clear to all today that Roe, in tandem with Doe v. Bolton, in fact created a regime of abortion-on-demand throughout all nine months of pregnancy for any reason agreed to by the mother and abortionist."" We followed up with Paulsen, who said by email that the court’s allowance of a late-term abortion to protect a woman’s health could extend to ""any physical, medical, emotional, psychological, or family reason a woman might evoke. The breadth of the ‘health’ exception/loophole is stunning,"" Paulsen told us. Other legal scholars challenge this read. To our inquiries, Lawrence Sager, a constitutional expert at the University of Texas School of Law, and Priscilla Smith, a Yale law professor who’s advocated for reproductive rights, each said the mandate that a physician determine if an abortion is needed to protect a woman’s health hasn’t played out lightly. By email, Smith said a physician could lose her or his license to practice or face criminal charges if the judgment that an abortion was needed to protect the woman’s health was later found inappropriate. ""Physicians do not take these significant potential penalties lightly,"" Smith wrote, which she said partly explains the rarity of late-term abortions. ""The other reason is that women don't just wake up one day after carrying a pregnancy for six months or more and decide to end it unless there is something really wrong with them,"" Smith said. Other fact checks Earlier this year, PolitiFact National and the Fact Checker at The Washington Post each noted that Clinton had repeatedly declared she’d support a law limiting late-term abortion if it includes exceptions to protect the health of the woman. PolitiFact National rated False a claim that Clinton ""believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child."" That ruling noted Clinton had said she supports restrictions on late-term abortions except in cases of rape, incest and when the mother’s life and health are in danger--which wasn't the same thing as unequivocally supporting abortions ""even on the due date."" The Fact Checker gave four Pinocchios to a claim that Clinton ""supports that a child can be aborted any time up until the moment it is born."" Conceding that some abortion opponents deem the ""health"" exception for abortion a loophole that allows a woman to get a late-term abortion, the story said ""the fact remains that Clinton is on record as accepting that there can be restrictions to abortion well before the imminent birth of the baby."" Our ruling Cruz said Clinton ""supports unlimited abortion on demand up until the moment of birth, including partial-birth abortion, with taxpayer funding."" Clinton clearly supports a woman’s right to choose an abortion and she’s called for ending congressional restrictions on Medicaid funding of abortions. However, she’s said since 2000 that she’d support a legislated late-term limit on abortion if it included an exception to protect the health of the woman--which the law against partial-birth abortions does not. She hasn't pitched for unlimited abortion on demand. We rate this statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Pete Gallego mostly wrong that Will Hurd 'absolutely' supports Trump's proposed border-long wall
","""We’re going to build a wall,"" Donald Trump says at the start of a TV ad from Democratic congressional nominee Pete Gallego of Alpine brought to our attention by Zach Hunter of the National Republican Congressional Committee. The commercial, launched as Gallego strives to retake the U.S. House seat he lost to Republican Will Hurd of Helotes in 2014, highlight's the Republican presidential nominee's repeated call for a border-length wall with Mexico. Midway, though, the focus  shifts to Hurd who, a female narrator intones, ""shares the same bad ideas"" as Trump. Next, you see Hurd, talking on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, saying: ""A wall absolutely makes sense."" Text under the snippet says: ""Rep. Hurd Talks Trump’s Idea to Build A Wall."" Hold on there. Far as we can tell, Hurd has stopped far short of saluting Trump’s championed border-long wall. In a March 2016 interview with the San Antonio Express-News, Hurd said: ""Building a wall is the most expensive, least effective way to do border security."" When we asked Gallego’s campaign for factual backup of the idea that Hurd is aboard with Trump on a border-long wall, campaign spokeswoman Lyndsey Rodriguez initially declared by email that Gallego ""never said that Rep. Hurd backs Trump’s border wall."" Rather, she wrote, ""our ad states that they share many of the same bad ideas."" By phone, Rodriguez later said: ""What we are saying in the ad is they both support some form of the wall."" Rodriguez also provided a web link to a video excerpt from the MSNBC interview in which Hurd talked about a wall. The 10-second excerpt shows Joe Scarborough, a host of the Morning Joe show, saying: ""Why do they all resort to that?"" ""Well, you need a wall in some places, all right,"" Hurd replied. ""In heavily populated places, a wall absolutely makes sense."" We took our own look at the full Sept. 8, 2015 Morning Joe interview of Hurd, which was pointed out to us by Hunter. Headlined ""Texas congressman refutes Trump’s wall idea,"" MSNBC's five-minute video shows Hurd endorsing a border wall in heavily populated places. But he otherwise was clear about a border-long wall not making sense--meaning Gallego’s ad misrepresented Hurd’s declared view. Our transcript below begins with Scarborough asking Hurd about how much of the border with Mexico is in the 23rd Congressional District he represents: SCARBOROUGH: ""I want to start with Donald Trump’s wall. So (addressing Hurd) you have, what, 800 miles--"" HURD: ""Over 800 miles--"" SCARBOROUGH: ""--bordering Mexico."" HURD: ""Right."" SCARBOROUGH: ""So tell me what you think when you hear Donald Trump and other people talking about building a giant wall."" HURD: ""You can’t build a wall from sea to shining sea, it just doesn’t work. It’s the most expensive way to do border security and it’s the least effective."" A moment later, Hurd said: ""What we need to do is we need to allow the men and women in Border Patrol to adjust their tactics, techniques and procedures as they see fit. You can’t have a one-size-fits-all solution in San Diego. It’s not going to necessarily work in Tucson and you need something different in El Paso."" SCARBOROUGH: ""Right, so why is it, though, that Republican candidates always--remember, John McCain turned to the cameras and said, ‘Build the dang wall.’ Why do they all resort to that?""

Dildo in University of Texas class could lead to a ticket, but would it? Uncertain
","A student group at the University of Texas at Austin warned of legal repercussions for taking sex toys to class. The group, Cocks Not Glocks, was founded to highlight what protesters depicted as the absurdity of Texas’ campus carry law, Senate Bill 11, which as of Aug. 1, 2016 newly allowed students at public colleges and universities to bring concealed firearms into classrooms and campus buildings, except in areas excluded by school rules. Since 1995, licensed individuals had been allowed to carry concealed handguns onto public college and university grounds.   On Aug. 24, 2016, UT’s first day of fall-semester classes, Cocks Not Glocks drew wide attention when it distributed about 4,000 dildos on campus in a show of opposition to campus carry. The group wrote on its Facebook event page, which showed almost 10,000 people pledging to attend the dildo distribution on the university’s Main Mall: ""The State of Texas has decided that it is not at all obnoxious to allow deadly concealed weapons in classrooms, however it DOES have strict rules about free sexual expression, to protect your innocence. ""You would receive a citation for taking a DILDO to class before you would get in trouble for taking a gun to class,"" the entry said. We’ve looked into the campus carry debate before, finding True a professor’s claim that prospective job applicants, students and guest speakers had decided to steer clear of the university out of concern concealed weapons might be present. But could one really get a citation for taking a dildo to class? A reader exhorted us to check. Group points to state obscenity law We messaged the Cocks Not Glocks Facebook page to ask for the basis of the citation claim and got a response from group founder and former student Jessica Jin, who wrote: ""UT school rules cite Texas state law when it comes to obscenities and state law says that openly brandishing/distributing/promoting a phallic object in public is an offense."" So a student who carried a concealed dildo to class, she acknowledged, ""of course wouldn't be in any sort of trouble."" Jin continued: ""Our demonstration, which could be seen as an act of performance art also, if it weren't covered by free speech and demonstration protections that superseded state obscenity clauses, would have qualified as an obscenity in Texas."" Specifically, she pointed us to the Texas Penal Code chapter 43, titled ""public indecency,"" sections 21 and 22. So we pulled up the Texas Penal Code, noting section 43.21, which states that material qualifies as ""obscene"" if: —""The average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest in sex."" --It ""depicts or describes… the male or female genitals in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal… or a device designed and marketed as useful primarily for stimulation of the human genital organs…"" --""Taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value."" Next, section 43.22 of the code states that ""a person commits an offense if he intentionally or knowingly displays or distributes an obscene photograph, drawing, or similar visual representation or other obscene material and is reckless about whether a person is present who will be offended or alarmed by the display or distribution."" ""An offense under this section is a Class C misdemeanor,"" it states. We looked up penal code chapter 12, ""punishments,"" and found that a Class C misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of up to $500. Jin also told us that UT school rules cite state law as the basis for outlawing dildos. In the 207-page ""general information"" catalog, we flipped to subchapter 13-200, ""prohibited expression,"" then to section 13-201, ""obscenity,"" which states: ""No person or organization will distribute or display on the campus any writing or visual image, or engage in any public performance, that is obscene. A writing image or performance is ‘obscene’ if it is obscene as defined in Texas Penal Code, Section 43.21 or successor provisions…"" No evidence of citations So it looked like there’s a risk of getting into trouble for brandishing a dildo in class. So, can and would such tickets be issued? Our search of the Lexis Nexis news database didn’t turn up instances of Texans getting prosecuted for brandishing dildos. Across the board, the only apparent prosecutions for sex toy crimes were made under a state law, overturned in 2008, which banned the sales of ""obscene"" items. We emailed the University of Texas and asked if students would indeed receive a citation for taking a dildo to class, as school rules seemed to indicate. A top  spokesman, J.B. Bird, responded by email that the university couldn’t speculate about a ""hypothetical situation."" Bird wrote: ""The university works carefully to enforce its policies based on facts. In First Amendment situations, context also matters tremendously."" So, maybe no citations. Then again, Bird wrote: ""I can tell you that the university does enforce its rules."" Speaking to the distribution of dildos by Cocks Not Glocks at the start of the fall 2016 semester, Bird said no tickets were issued because ""the protests around campus carry earlier this year appeared to be examples of protected political speech."" Reminder: The Texas penal code (based on the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Ruling Miller v. California) exempted material from obscenity restrictions unless it lacks ""serious"" political value. From outside UT, we heard back from the  University of Houston Law Center, which referred our questions about whether citations would be issued for classroom dildos to Peter Linzer, a professor of constitutional law, who wrote back that there is no ""definitive answer"" on the legality of toting dildos into classrooms because two portions of relevant state law make the offense situational: ""lacks serious, literary, artistic, political and scientific value"" and ""is reckless about whether a person is present who will be offended."" ""Tell the students to ask if anyone is offended,"" Linzer wrote. ""A cop would make a fool of himself (by issuing a citation) and I doubt that the Travis County DA would prosecute."" Our attempt to elicit comment from Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County district attorney, ran aground. By email, she said her office only prosecutes felony charges. To get a fix on misdemeanor prosecutions such as citations for dildo possession, Lehmberg suggested we reach out to the city’s municipal courts. There, we were unable to identify anyone who could speak to charges leveled for wielding dildos on campus. Our ruling Cocks Not Glocks said students would get citations for taking dildos to class. Texas obscenity law allows citations to be issued to dildo toters provided the dildo is displayed and the person doing so is reckless about who could be offended and the display lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. That said, we failed to identify any instance of such a ticket being issued nor did UT officials say it was likely to happen--which leaves such a citation hypothetical and situational, it seems to us. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Loretta Sanchez misleads with Prop 57 claim
"," Will felons convicted of drive-by shootings, giving guns to gangs or firing a weapon on a school yard ""get out of jail free"" if California’s Proposition 57 passes? That’s the provocative claim Orange County Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez made this week during a U.S. Senate campaign debate in Los Angeles. Sanchez is competing against fellow Democrat and front runner Attorney General Kamala Harris to succeed retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer. ""If you give guns to gangs, you can get out of jail free, if (Prop 57) passes. If you do a driveby shooting, you can get out of jail free, if this proposition passes. If you discharge guns on a school yard, you can get out of jail free,"" Sanchez claimed.  Sanchez makes her claims about Prop 57 at the 28:30 mark in the video above. Sanchez opposes Prop 57, a measure on the November ballot that aims to reduce the state’s prison crowding by making some offenders eligible for early release. Harris has declined to take a position on Prop 57, or any ballot measure, because as attorney general she is charged with writing an independent summary and title for each measure. She has generally supported what she calls ‘smart on crime’ efforts to reduce incarceration. Looking at Sanchez’s claim, we wondered: Would offenders convicted of those gun crimes really benefit from Prop 57? We set out on a fact-check. Our research This measure is officially called the Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act of 2016. It would make some prisoners convicted of what state law deems ‘nonviolent crimes’ eligible for early parole. It does not apply to inmates convicted of the state’s 23 ‘violent’ offenses listed in Penal Code Section 667.5 (c) including murder, robbery and kidnapping. This is where Sanchez’s claim appears on target: None of the gun crimes she listed are among the 23 violent crimes, meaning offenders who committed them would be eligible for early release if Prop 57 passes, a Sanchez campaign spokesman said. Experts who have examined the measure agree offenders convicted of most crimes not among the 23 would be eligible, with certain exceptions. All sex offenders, for example, would be excluded from consideration under rules state prison officials say will be enacted if Prop 57 passes. Some sex offenses are now considered nonviolent. No getting ‘out of jail free’ Sanchez cited three gun crimes that could apply to Prop 57. But the next portion of her statement, saying a felon convicted of those crimes gets ""out of jail free,"" is flat wrong and misleading. The measure does not apply to jail inmates and does not directly set anyone free. It would make some eligible for a parole board hearing, which in turn could lead to an early release, or not. ""To suggest any presumption that they will be paroled is, I think, a far step,"" state Sen. Mark Leno, a supporter of the measure, was quoted in the Voice of San Diego in July. ""I don’t want to overlook the fact that this is just about eligibility and there will be a consideration by the [parole board] of all the facts."" The Voice of San Diego article pointed out that ""the state parole board doesn’t grant release lightly. According to [the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation], out of 5,300 inmates up for parole in 2015, only 902, or 17 percent, were released."" Sanchez’s campaign spokesman said her ‘get out of jail free’ comment ""is a figure of speech because that is how it will feel to the victims. She has said that early release is wrong and disrespectful to the victims.""   Our ruling Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez claimed in a U.S. Senate campaign debtate that: ""If you give guns to gangs, you can get out of jail free, if (California’s Prop 57) passes. If you do a driveby shooting, you can get out of jail free, if this proposition passes. If you discharge guns on a school yard, you can get out of jail free."" Experts agree prisoners who committed crimes deemed ‘nonviolent’ under state law, including the three gun crimes Sanchez listed, could be eligible for early parole if Prop 57 passes. Becoming eligible for a parole board hearing is far from getting ""out of jail free."" Particularly when less than 20 percent of hearings lead to early release. Sanchez’s figure of speech -- which she employed three times -- greatly alters what otherwise might have been an accurate or mostly accurate statement. The ""get out of jail free"" comment is deceptive and distorts what Prop 57 proposes. We rate Sanchez’s statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

"['Climate Change', 'PunditFact', 'Rush Limbaugh']","
Rush Limbaugh wrong that lack of hurricanes diminishes climate change argument
","As Hurricane Matthew threatened the east coast of Florida, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh cast a far-flung conspiracy about the deadly storm’s hype.   Limbaugh, who lives in Palm Beach County, used his radio show to decry what he sees as the politicization of storms by the left to validate climate change. At the time, Hurricane Matthew was a Category 4 storm. Limbaugh accused the Obama administration of ""playing games"" with hurricane forecasting to push climate change. Hurricane forecasts come from the National Hurricane Center. The center is controlled by the National Weather Service, which falls under the administration’s Commerce Department. Limbaugh recalled how former Vice President Al Gore, author of An Inconvenient Truth, said after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans that the world could expect more destructive hurricanes because of climate change.   ""And then what happened? We had 11 years of no hurricanes -- 11 straight years of no major hurricanes striking land in the United States, which just bores a hole right through the whole climate change argument,"" Limbaugh said on his radio show Oct. 5. ""They want people to think this way: Hurricane reported. Must be climate change."" Limbaugh has made similar and wrong arguments in the past, such as when he said the media made up polar vortexes to reinforce global warming. His latest theory about U.S. hurricane landfalls amounting to ""a hole right through"" the validity of climate change is also wrong. A history of hurricanes The last major hurricane to hit the United States was Wilma, which pummeled Florida’s west side as a Category 3 storm in 2005. Wilma was a Category 5 storm at its peak while at sea and the most intense hurricane reported anywhere until Hurricane Patricia hit Mexico in 2015. As Hurricane Matthew approached, Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, tweeted Oct. 5 it has been 4,000 days since the last major hurricane hit the United States (or approximately 10.9 years).  A ""major"" hurricane means the storm is a category 3, 4 or 5, said Dave Nolan, another professor of the Rosenstiel School. To be a Category 3 hurricane, winds at the surface must exceed about 115 mph (100 knots) somewhere in the storm. ""Major"" does not refer to size, damages or fatalities — it’s about intensity, as measured by maximum wind speed, Nolan added. Hugh Gladwin, an associate professor in the department of Global and Sociocultural Studies at Florida International University, said Limbaugh added that storm surge and amount of damage are also factors and some would argue more important than wind speed. If those factors are considered, it is possible that Hurricane Sandy, the destructive 2012 storm that disrupted the East Coast, could qualify as a major hurricane. Conflating weather with climate Limbaugh uses the stretch without hurricanes to make a case against climate change, but experts said that’s all wrong. ""This has nothing at all to do with climate change,"" Nolan said. ""Hurricanes are extreme events with a lot of variability from year to year, so they can't be used to indicate long term trends about climate."" He also said Limbaugh’s U.S.-centric take on climate change ignores weather events from around the world. An example of these events include super typhoon Haiyan, which was the most intense typhoon to ever hit the Philippines, and Hurricane Patricia, one of the strongest ever to hit Mexico. Suzana Camargo, a professor of ocean and climate physics at Columbia University’s Lamont Doherty Earth Institute, said the Atlantic only corresponds to about 13 percent of the global number of tropical cyclones (hurricanes), with about 30 percent of the tropical cyclones occurring in the western North Pacific (where they are called typhoons). Point being, the lack of hurricanes hitting the United States is a localized issue, and doesn’t speak about the global issue of climate change. ""The relationship between climate change and major hurricanes is complicated and there is not much agreement on it among meteorologists,"" Gladwin said. Some researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, compiled research on global warming and hurricanes in 2015 and concluded that a warming climate, by heating the oceans, will make hurricanes more intense. But explicit connections have not been determined. ""It is premature to conclude that human activities — and particularly greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming — have already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity,"" reads NOAA’s analysis. Nolan said that science has changed course in the last 10 years. Between 1990-2005 some papers suggested that global warming will lead to more and stronger hurricanes, and we can already see this effect over the last 40 years. Since then, academic consensus has emphasized global warming will probably make fewer hurricanes, but some of them will be stronger, and we can't see any trend at all in the historical record. Limbaugh mischaracterizes Gore as an example of a liberal who has associated more hurricanes with climate change. Gore points to research that oceans have gotten warmer and have led to more intense hurricanes, but both Nolan and Gladwin said Gore never said there would be more hurricanes. Either way, Limbaugh fails to make the case that the 11-year stretch without major hurricanes hitting the United States disproves climate change. ""It's not valid to look at the number of landfalling major hurricanes in the United States to say anything about climate change, since random changes in atmospheric steering currents, unrelated to climate change, are partially responsible for the 11-year U.S. major hurricane drought’,"" said Jeff Masters, the director of meteorology at Weather Underground. Our ruling Limbaugh said the fact that the United States went 11 straight years without major hurricanes ""just bores a hole right through the whole climate change argument."" It doesn’t. There are several major flaws in his line of reasoning. First, looking only at major hurricanes that hit the United States ignores storm activity around the world. Second, storm frequency does not strictly correlate with rising temperature. Third, many other data points prove that climate change is real. Limbaugh’s argument is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/827d3cf9-63b0-4f4c-8da5-4dbef2a5204f",/factchecks/2016/oct/07/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-wrong-lack-hurricanes-diminishes-cli/

Jacobs did not take money from Ciminelli in State Senate race
","Candidates running for State Senate in Buffalo agree that corruption is a problem in state government. They do not agree on how to fix it. Chris Jacobs, the Republican candidate who currently serves as Erie County Clerk, is pushing term limits for state lawmakers. The Republican majority already supports term limits for legislative leaders, but not members. Amber Small, the Democrat running for the seat, wants to see outside income limited for lawmakers and supports a hefty set of reforms to the state’s campaign finance system. Her campaign is also trying to link Jacobs to the latest string of corruption charges from U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. ""What shouldn’t be lost in this web of public corruption is that the same candidate plastering Western New York with commercials calling for an end to corruption has been financed by the same men who are now facing charges in one of Western New York’s largest public corruption schemes,"" Small’s campaign manager Matt Tighe said in The Buffalo News. Tighe is referring to three men involved in a federal corruption probe that were named in a complaint from Bharara’s office in September. Louis P. Ciminelli, a Buffalo-area developer was named, along with two LPCiminelli executives, Michael Laipple and Kevin Schuler. Candidates in a handful of competitive state Senate districts are using Albany’s corruption problem as a hook in this year's election. Is Small’s campaign manager right about her opponent taking donations from Ciminelli and his colleagues? Who’s donated? Ciminelli and Laipple  both donated to Jacobs in his campaigns for Erie County Clerk, the first in 2012. Kevin Schuler has not, according to filings with the Board of Elections. Laipple donated $200 to Jacobs' campaign once in 2012. Ciminelli has given Jacobs three donations since 2011, totaling $5,500. He gave Jacobs $2,000 in his first race for county clerk in 2011 and $2,500 in 2014 when he was up for re-election. Jacobs’ campaign confirmed that Jacobs donated the same amount to United Way when the allegations became public in September. Ciminelli Development Company gave Jacobs $1,050 in the 2014 election for county clerk. Altogether, Ciminelli, Laipple, and Ciminelli’s company gave Jacobs $6,750 between 2011 and 2014 according to filings with the Board of Elections. The donations amount to a fraction of the $300,000 Jacobs has raised in his race for state senate according to the latest filing. None of the accused donated to Jacobs since 2014, though his campaign account for county clerk did give Jacobs a $100,000 head start in this year’s election. He also received donations from at least two political action committees that Ciminelli donated to, but neither has exclusively supported Jacobs. Our ruling Amber Small’s campaign manager said in The Buffalo News that Chris Jacobs ""has been financed by the same men who are now facing charges in one of Western New York’s largest public corruption schemes."" It’s true that Ciminelli and Laipple have given to Jacobs in the past, but not in the race for state Senate. Their donations account for a small portion of what Jacobs has raised this year and in years past.

Ad claims Kelly Ayotte voted for billion dollar tax breaks for 'big oil'
","As the U.S. Senate race heats up, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee took out an ad bashing Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte’s record on climate. The 30-second spot takes aim at Ayotte’s ties to ""big oil."" ""Kelly Ayotte voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks, and they gave her campaign contributions,"" the narrator says. PolitiFact decided to see if there was any truth to the claim. Let’s look at Ayotte’s votes first. Politifact has looked at similar claims, like when the Senate Majority PAC said former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown ""voted to give oil companies big tax breaks."" PolitiFact found that claim Mostly True. In this fact-check, we’ll focus on Ayotte’s votes. We’ll tackle campaign contributions separately. The DSCC pointed us to Ayotte’s votes in 2011 and 2012 against measures that would have stripped existing tax breaks from the ""big five"" oil companies: Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell and ConocoPhillips. The 2011 Democratic-backed proposal would have eliminated five tax breaks for the companies and generated an estimated $21 billion over a decade, according to the  New York Times.  The bill that came a year later would have eliminated $24 billion in tax subsidies from the five oil companies, according to the Boston Globe. Specifically, the measures would have kept those five multinational oil companies from using these existing tax breaks: • Deductions on taxes paid to foreign governments • Deductions on domestic manufacturing costs • Deductions for intangible drilling costs • Percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas wells • Deductions for qualified tertiary injectant expenses Three of these breaks applied specifically to the oil industry. The other two -- the ones about manufacturing costs and taxes paid to foreign governments -- can be claimed by businesses other than oil companies. If passed, these five provisions would still have applied to companies beyond the ""big five"" oil firms. In each of the two years, the proposal failed to advance in the U.S. Senate by margins of 52-48 in 2011 and 51-47 in 2012. The bills needed 60 votes in order to cut off debate and take a final vote. Ayotte joined most Republicans and a handful of Democrats from oil states to oppose the measure both times it hit the Senate floor. The bill’s opponents sometimes cited a March 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that concluded withholding subsidies from companies could increase prices at the pump. In general the ad is correct that Ayotte sided with the position of ""big oil"" when she voted against advancing the bills. But the ad’s wording is misleading. It states Ayotte ""voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks."" Ayotte really voted against stripping the companies of tax breaks they already enjoyed. Meanwhile, Ayotte’s campaign pointed to several votes she has taken opposing tax credits for the oil and gas industry. One amendment, to a highway bill, would have repealed more than a dozen various tax credits including those for alternative fuel mixtures, certain plug-in vehicles, biodiesel and renewable diesel used as fuel and electricity produced from certain renewable resources. The amendment did not propose to repeal any of the tax breaks for the ""big five"" oil companies mentioned above, but it did target two credits dealing with oil -- one for producing oil and gas from marginal wells, and another for enhanced oil recovery. Neither was in effect when the amendment was offered and the marginal well credit hasn’t been used since its creation in 2004, according to a 2013 article from lobbying firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP. Ayotte was one of 26 senators who voted for the amendment. It was opposed by a bipartisan group of 76 senators, including Democrat Jeanne Shaheen. Ayotte’s campaign also pointed to a February amendment that would have phased out tax credits for fossil fuels on the same schedule as those for wind farms. The proposal, offered by Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, targeted many of the same existing tax breaks for ""big oil"" as the bills from 2011 and 2012. For example, it would have phased out deductions for intangible drilling costs and deductions on domestic manufacturing costs, among others. Ayotte joined most Democrats to vote for the amendment, which was defeated 50 to 45.  Our Ruling The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said Kelly Ayotte ""voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks."" In 2011 and 2012, Ayotte did indeed vote against measures that would have barred the biggest five oil companies from taking advantage of tax breaks they already enjoyed, which added up to more than $20 billion. But that’s slightly different than what the ad says. Rather than vote to give the companies a new break, as the ad implies, Ayotte voted to support the status quo. Ayotte’s record is more complex, however, and she cast more recent votes that would have repealed some tax breaks for big oil. The statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/oct/07/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/ad-claims-kelly-ayotte-voted-billion-dollar-tax-br/

Tim Kaine said Trump ticket wants to deport 16 million, end birthright citizenship
","Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said he and Hillary Clinton support comprehensive immigration reform that keeps families together, while Donald Trump wants to deport millions of people. ""Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship,"" Kaine said during the vice presidential debate Oct. 4. ""So if you're born here, but your parents don't have documents, they want to eliminate that. That's another 4.5 million people."" Kaine continued to say the Republican ticket has called for a deportation force and that they want to go ""house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people."" Pence said it was nonsense. So we wanted to know: Has Trump proposed to deport 16 million people, and do the Republican candidates plan to ""get rid of"" birthright citizenship? Kaine’s tally of 16 million possibly deported by Trump includes people who are in the country illegally (about 11 million) and U.S. born children of undocumented parents (about 4.5 million, according to Pew Research Center). As Trump began his pursuit of the Republican presidential nomination, he presented an immigration plan that called for an end to birthright citizenship, saying it is ""the biggest magnet for illegal immigration."" That was the old version of Trump’s plan. Trump outlined his latest immigration plan a year later, on Aug. 31 in Arizona. His 10-point plan did not call for deporting 16 million people or ending birthright citizenship. He emphasized that he wanted to deport 2 million ""criminal aliens."" Trump’s ‘deportation force’ days Kaine’s comments aren’t unfounded. Trump has not been consistent on immigration throughout his campaign. In that same Arizona speech, Trump talked about the broader undocumented population having to leave first in order to come back: ""Those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only: To return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else."" Clinton’s campaign pointed out a line in that speech where he said ""anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation."" Leading up to the primaries, Trump said he wanted undocumented families to stay together, but ""they have to go."" In a September 2015 interview on 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley asked Trump what he would do with 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally. ""If they've done well, they're going out and they're coming back in legally ... We're rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way,"" Trump said. In November 2015, a day after one of the Republican primary debates, Joe Scarborough of MSNBC asked Trump, ""How do you deport 12 million illegal immigrants?"" ""You do it. You do it. Because they're here illegally, you do it,"" Trump responded. In that same interview, he said, ""you’re going to have a deportation force, and you’re going to do it humanely."" Birthright citizenship So Trump has talked extensively about deporting the undocumented population, some faster than others. But that doesn’t mean he necessarily wants to deport their U.S.-born children. Trump hasn’t talked about birthright citizenship and ""anchor babies"" much since the heyday of the GOP primary. In November, Trump said a constitutional amendment would not be needed to deal with the citizenship of children born in the United States to undocumented parents. ""You need an act of Congress. You don't have to go through a new amendment or anything, a new constitutional amendment,"" Trump said November 2015 in an MSNBC interview. ""But anchor babies. A woman is pregnant; she goes over to the border, has a baby on our land, now we take care of the baby for the next 85 years."" Trump’s campaign did not respond to questions about his current position on birthright citizenship. Trump’s call for an end to birthright citizenship is no longer prominently featured in the immigration reform section of Trump’s campaign website, but a file of his first plan outlining it is still available. The 14th Amendment established birthright citizenship, which says ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."" That clause of the amendment is widely understood to mean that everyone born on U.S. soil is automatically an American citizen, despite parents’ immigration status. Pence, Trump’s running mate, cosponsored the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009, introduced in the House but never brought to any vote. The bill sought to amend immigration law to consider a person born in the United States ""subject to the jurisdiction"" of the United States if the U.S.-born person has at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or national; a lawful permanent resident living in the United States; or an immigrant performing active service in the U.S. Armed Forces. So that would have prevented U.S.-born children of two parents without lawful or military status from obtaining citizenship. It is technically possible to end birthright citizenship for persons born in the United States to undocumented immigrants by repealing the 14th Amendment, said Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute. Otherwise, a measure like Pence’s bill that is signed into law could be challenged all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court over 14th Amendment concerns. A big jump, plus legal concerns To reach 16 million deportations, Kaine assumes the citizenship of 4.5 million people who were born on U.S. soil to parents in the country illegally would be retroactively taken away under Trump. Trump said several times in 2015 that he does not think citizenship should have been granted to people with undocumented parents. But he has not proposed to deport them all or outlined a plan to revoke birthright citizenship that’s already been granted.  The Clinton campaign disagrees, pointing to an August 2015 exchange between Trump and Bill O'Reilly, who asked, ""Illegal immigrant mother and father living in Los Angeles, two children who are American citizens, born here.  If you're president do you order authorities to take that family into custody?"" Trump answered, ""We have no choice. I'm sorry, Bill. We have to bring them out."" Trump's responses to similar questions were also vague. In another August 2015 interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo, he said undocumented parents would have to leave and unless they were ""bad"" parents they would take their baby with citizenship with them. Again, that wasn't a clear proposal to deport 4.5 million people with citizenship. Doing so would invite even more legal challenges than trying to remove or alter the 14th Amendment. ""Such a retroactive statute would clearly be far more controversial than merely changing the rules prospectively,"" said David A. Martin, an immigration, constitutional law and international law scholar and professor emeritus at the University of Virginia School of Law. Any retroactive stripping of citizenship to those born in the United States to undocumented parents would likely be challenged by the courts, Costa said, because ""they acquired citizenship under the longstanding interpretation of the law and the Constitution that was in effect at the time they acquired it."" Such a retroactive law would be considered an ""ex post facto"" law (which means making an act illegal even though it was legal when committed). Ex post facto laws, which generally apply to criminal penalties, are prohibited by the Constitution. ""I'm sure that it would be unconstitutional to change the birthright citizenship rule retroactively, probably as a violation of substantive due process,"" said Peter Schuck, an emeritus professor of law at Yale University. Our ruling Kaine said, ""Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people. 11 million who are here without documents, and both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship."" Trump has talked about the entire undocumented population of about 11 million people having to leave the country at some point in order to come back and reside legally. But Kaine assumes Trump would try to deport 4.5 million people who have citizenship because they were born in the country to undocumented parents. Trump has said birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment is questionable but has not proposed retroactively stripping it away and deporting this group. Trump did call for an end to birthright citizenship during the primary. His most-recent immigration plan does not mention the idea, though he has not renounced it altogether. As for Pence, he co-sponsored a bill seven years ago to amend birthright citizenship eligibility to children who have at least one parent with legal or military status. Kaine’s statement is partially accurate, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c19c66d8-2ec0-41f0-9dad-df909ccbf357 Clarification: The fact-check was updated shortly after publication to account for more of Trump's comments on birthright citizenship.

Oxfam: World's 62 richest own as much as poorest 3.6 billion
","Some of the starkest statistics we see center around income inequality. A recent post from Oxfam America, the U.S. branch of the global anti-poverty group, particularly piqued our interest. Oxfam wants the presidential candidates to tackle the issue in their upcoming debate. ""The world's 62 richest people own the same wealth as the 3.6 billion poorest. What will you do to combat runaway inequality in the US and around the world?"" Oxfam America asked on Twitter. Is that so? It turns out Oxfam America isn’t quite right. But the number is in the ballpark. Oxfam came up with the comparison in January using two different reports. The first, from Credit Suisse, estimated the distribution of household wealth worldwide. The second was Forbes’ list of billionaires. We'll walk you through the calculations and a couple of caveats. The Credit Suisse report Analysts hired by Credit Suisse estimated total personal wealth at $250 trillion. From there, they estimated that the bottom half of the world’s population (approximately 3.6 billion people) owned less than 1 percent of all wealth. To be precise, (and you can find this on page 110 of the full Credit Suisse databook) the bottom half of the world’s population own .59 percent of world household wealth, which comes out to about $1.4 trillion. There are some caveats about the calculation. Raul Santaeulalia-Llopis, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said that Credit Suisse may have underestimated wealth in low-income countries but not enough to make the numbers much different. The strongest criticism of the Credit Suisse report is that it includes a significant number of people in wealthy countries who are not poor but have large debts. That produces misleading results, experts told us. ""(They) are not actually living in poverty but simply have very low or even negative net worth due to amassment of debt to finance housing, education and consumption beyond current income,"" Brent Beardsley, managing director at the Boston Consulting Group, said. ""In this case, wealth -- or rather net worth --  is not an adequate measure of what is commonly understood as poverty."" Forbes billionaire estimates The second half of the comparison is relatively straightforward. Oxfam used Forbes' list of billionaires and counted how many people it would take to reach $1.4 trillion -- the figure representing the wealth of the bottom half of the global population. Forbes' calculations aren't perfect, but they are the best estimate publicly available. Forbes tracks changes in real time, but the base comparisons depend on estimates generated by members of the Forbes team. Sometimes the billionaires themselves say the numbers are off, because all the necessary information is not public knowledge. Then there are fluctuations due to changing currency exchange rates and the ups and downs of the stock market. The list can’t deliver pinpoint accuracy, but it does represent a good faith effort to assess the net worth of the world’s wealthiest people. Like the wealth calculations in the Credit Suisse report, it should be seen as a reasonable estimate. So what does Forbes say today, about 10 months after Oxfam wrote its report? According to the publisher, the world’s wealthiest 54 people control $1.4 trillion -- the same amount attributed to the combined wealth of the bottom 50 percent of people living in the world. Our ruling Oxfam America said the world's 62 richest people own the same wealth as the 3.6 billion poorest. The Oxfam analysis was based on a report from Credit Suisse and the Forbes list of billionaires. The exact number of billionaires might well be different from the 62 that Oxfam said. But out of world population of 7.3 billion, it makes little difference if the tally were 100. It still represents a tiny sliver of a percentage of the people in the world. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6158005b-55d8-4bf3-84eb-f25bd2df4025",/factchecks/2016/oct/07/oxfam-america/oxfam-worlds-62-richest-own-much-poorest-36-billio/

Harris did not call Biden a racist during her busing attack
","During a Democratic primary debate in Miami, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., attacked former Vice President Joe Biden over his record opposing busing as a method to achieve school integration in the 1970s. Their fight about his stance on busing has been revived since Biden named Harris as his running mate. But social media posts and Trump campaign officials have twisted what she said. One Instagram post, which was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news, said: ""During the debate Kamala Harris (called) Joe Biden a racist based on his policies. And (asked) him to apologize and he refused. Now she’s VP.""  Trump campaign senior adviser Katrina Pierson made a similar claim: ""Not long ago. Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist and asked for an apology she never received."" Many reporters, including Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, have shown that this statement is wrong. Harris specifically said Biden was not a racist. RELATED: The Democratic debate resurrected controversy over busing. But is it an issue today? Harris prefaced her attack in the June 27, 2019, debate by telling Biden, ""I do not believe you are a racist. I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground."" Then she pivoted to the topic of his record on busing: ""It was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. It was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose busing. There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools. She was bused to school every day. That little girl was me."" RELATED: Was Kamala Harris ‘part of second class to integrate’ Berkeley's public schools? During their back and forth, Biden offered a misleading defense of his position on busing. About a week later, Biden apologized for his remarks about working with segregationist senators, but he did not walk back his position on busing. When CNN asked Harris about Biden’s apology, she said, ""I think that he is right to recognize the impact of his words, and I applaud him for doing that, having the courage to do it."" But they still disagreed about busing. ""He says he's sorry, and I'm going to take him at his word. But again, that doesn't address the issue of busing in America,"" she said. The Trump campaign highlighted earlier comments Harris made criticizing Biden’s statements about working with segregationists.  There is one candidate Harris considers a racist. Harris, whose mother was born in India and father was from Jamaica, called Trump a racist during an interview in February 2019 with The Root.The interviewer asked Harris if Trump was a racist. ""When you talk about him calling African countries s---hole countries, when you talk about him referring to immigrants as rapists and murderers, I don’t think you can reach any other conclusion,"" Harris said. An Instagram post said Harris called Biden ""a racist"" during a Democratic debate. That’s not what Harris said about Biden. At a June 2019 debate, she said to Biden: ""I do not believe you are a racist."" Then Harris launched into an attack of Biden’s record opposing busing in the 1970s.

Did Trump say he will terminate Social Security if re-elected?
","A Facebook post has a dire warning about the future of Social Security under President Donald Trump. ""Donald Trump says he will ‘terminate’ Social Security if re-elected,"" states the Aug. 10 post by Social Security Works, a nonprofit group that supports expanding the federal program. ""A vote for Trump is a vote to destroy our Social Security system."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) RELATED: Donald Trump’s payroll tax holiday: What you need to know Trump did use the word ""terminate"" when speaking about the payroll tax that funds Social Security, but his actual memo only pauses the tax for some employees for a few months. Trump hasn’t said he would end Social Security payments, but he has made comments that many have interpreted as him wanting to eliminate the payroll tax entirely.  On Aug. 8, Trump issued a memo that directed the Treasury secretary to defer the withholding of the payroll tax on wages paid between Sept. 1 and Dec. 31. Each paycheck, employees see 6.2% of their wages go to Washington to help fund Social Security, while employers pay the same amount. That means someone making the median weekly wage of about $1,000 would see an extra $62 in their paycheck. Trump’s memo applies to people making up to $2,000 per week, so people who earn $104,000 a year or higher wouldn’t get the tax break.  By one estimate, the tax holiday would initially save taxpayers, or alternatively cost the Social Security Trust Fund, $100 billion.  The longer term impacts are still unclear. Employees could be asked to pay the money back, though Trump has said he hopes to forgive the payments all together.  If the money isn’t paid back, Congress will need to find different funding to support Social Security, as it did during the Obama years. Or the Social Security trust funds end up running dry sooner than expected. RELATED: Claim about 'killing' payroll tax and Social Security needs more context Trump never said he’d terminate the Social Security program, but has talked about terminating the program’s funding source.  While speaking, Trump used the words ""terminate"" or ""ending"" to describe his plans for the tax, although sometimes he described it as a possibility, while in other statements he sounded more forceful. Social Security Works pointed to these statements by Trump: At an Aug. 8 press briefing, Trump said: ""If I’m victorious on Nov. 3, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax. So I’m going to make them all permanent. …. But if I win, I may extend and terminate. In other words, I’ll extend it beyond the end of the year and terminate the tax.""   At an Aug. 10 briefing, Trump said: ""I signed directives to give a payroll tax holiday, with the understanding that after the election — on the assumption that it would be victorious for an administration that’s done a great job — we will be ending that tax. We’ll be terminating that tax. … But the payroll tax is a big deal for people. It’s a tremendous saving for people. And we’re going to be doing it, and we intend to terminate it at the end of the appropriate period of time."" Jenna Ellis, a lawyer for the Trump campaign and Trump, tweeted: ""President Trump said if he is re-elected, he will look into terminating the payroll tax permanently!"" As is often the case, we are left to try to interpret Trump’s spoken words, which differ from how administration officials explain them. ""The logical conclusion of terminating the payroll tax is that all benefits will cease,"" said Linda Benesch, a spokesperson for Social Security Works. Administration officials have argued that Trump wasn’t calling for permanently getting rid of the payroll tax. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on CNN’s State of the Union, ""I believe he was referring to doing away with the payback of the deferral. And I think his intent here — and it's written in the E.O. — it's very clear — that we will take any steps possible to forgive this deferral. That's what he was actually saying."" CNN’s Dana Bash replied: ""That's what you're saying. That is not what the president said at all. He said the opposite."" It’s worth noting that Trump can’t unilaterally end the payroll tax; he needs Congress to agree. And while it’s true that the payroll tax provides nearly 90% of the revenues for Social Security, Congress could decide to use another way to pay for the program. The program’s promise to people exists outside of the funding mechanism.  Eugene Steuerle, an economist at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, compared Trump’s statements about terminating the Social Security payroll tax with his promises to create a substitute for Obamacare. ""It doesn’t mean a lot until one gets a full proposal, but the difficulty in designing a proposal is that the tax money coming in is currently less than the benefit money going out,"" he said. ""So where would the money to pay beneficiaries come from after the modest trust fund becomes depleted more quickly? And how would benefits be determined?"" Social Security Works said, ""Donald Trump says he will ‘terminate’ Social Security if re-elected."" Trump never said he will terminate Social Security, but he has discussed terminating the program’s primary funding source. Administrative officials said that he was referring to doing away with the payback of the deferral. Congress and the president could find an alternative way to fund Social Security. Trump hasn’t proposed such an alternative.  The statement has an element of truth but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression.

Fact-checking the pedophilia attacks against Joe Biden
","It’s no secret that political candidates running for office face a barrage of personal attacks on the campaign trail — the 2020 presidential election is no different.  One of the most egregious examples we have come across is illustrated by a flood of social media posts that claim Joe Biden, the former vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee for president, is a ""pedophile."" Allegations of child sex molestation are a prominent part of the QAnon conspiracy theory that suggests a ""deep state"" is working against President Trump’s success. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We found no credible evidence that supports this claim. Pedophilia is characterized by an obsession of seeing children as sex objects, according to Nolo’s Plain English Law Dictionary: ""A person who acts upon this obsession, by molesting a child, taking explicit photographs, and performing other acts specified by law, is guilty of a crime."" In Biden’s more than 40 years of public life — including two prior runs for the Democratic presidential nomination and eight years as vice president — there have been no formal accusations, complaints, arrests or investigations that implicate him in any sort of sex crimes involving kids. Biden has been accused by some adult women of unwanted touching in public — and former Senate staffer Tara Reade accused him of sexual assault — but there have never been any credible accusations of Biden engaging in inappropriate conduct with children.  Our searches of Google and the Nexis database, dating back to Biden’s Senate days, turned up no arrests, news reports, or authoritative testimonies of inappropriate acts by Biden involving children. When we reached out to discuss the accusations, Biden’s campaign pointed us to a May 2020 statement that was issued in response to an Instagram post by Donald Trump Jr. in which the president’s son shared an image of Biden saying, ""See you later, alligator"" alongside a photo of an alligator saying, ""In a while, pedophile,"" to his 3 million followers. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden, told the New York Times, ""No repulsive, manipulative tactic will change the subject from how almost 90,000 Americans have paid for Donald Trump’s coronavirus negligence with their lives and how the booming economy he inherited from the Obama-Biden Administration is now suffering from depression-level job losses."" The COVID-19 death count in the U.S., as of this writing, is over 164,000. Trump Jr. later claimed he was ""just joking"" in a Twitter post, yet also repeated the insinuation by saying Biden should stop his ""unwanted touching"" and posted a collage of photographs of Biden with children at White House events. Biden briefly addressed Trump Jr.’s actions shortly after, saying that what the president’s son was ""trying to do is get something going on the internet"" by repeating the claim often enough that people believe it.   ""It’s sick,"" Biden said during a Yahoo News virtual town hall. ""But he is his father’s son."" President Donald Trump has also been accused of sexual misconduct by several women. Dated photos of Trump with young girls, some of them doctored, have also spread on social media along with unproven allegations that he, too, is a pedophile. On social media, the accusation is often accompanied by images, memes, GIFs and videos of Biden appearing to touch children inappropriately. The photos that are real often lack context. Others are not of him or have been deceptively edited to suggest something improper. We found that these images are overwhelmingly captured at public events when he is posing for pictures or greeting people and many depict Biden showing affection toward his family. For example, one photo, of Biden leaning down by a boy with his hand cupped on the child’s face, shows him comforting his grandson at the funeral of Beau Biden, Biden’s son who died of brain cancer. Another image from the funeral routinely used in posts shows Biden kissing the top of his granddaughter’s head as she stands holding her mother’s hand. Another shows Biden leaning in to kiss his grandson during his 2013 swearing-in ceremony as vice president. RELATED: No, this photo doesn't show Joe Biden engaging in disturbing behavior with a boy Some of the photos used in the posts were taken at various White House events over the years, and in multiple cases the parents have spoken out against claims that Biden behaved inappropriately around their children. One often-used photo shows Biden touching a young girl’s arm as he leans in to whisper something as she looks slightly uncomfortable. The image shows Maggie Coons, the daughter of Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, during her father’s swearing-in ceremony in January 2015.  After the clip went viral, Sen. Coons, a Democrat, told Fox News host Chris Wallace that Biden was simply offering her reassurance and that his daughter didn’t think he was creepy. Coons said that Biden, who held Coons’ Senate seat before resigning to serve as vice president, has known his children their whole lives. ""I could hear him,"" Coons said in the interview. ""He was leaning forward and whispering some encouragement to her about how, when he was sworn in, his own daughter Ashley was 13 and she felt awkward and uncomfortable."" Carly Melin, former member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, spoke out on Twitter when a 2014 photo she took with Biden and former U.S. Rep. Rick Nolan, D-Minn., became the subject of a Twitter thread by conservative columnist Richard Armande Mills. In the image, Melin and Biden are both holding Melin’s son. Mills, a conservative columnist for Turning Point USA, wrote in the tweet that Biden is ""an open sexual predator."" ""Sir, I don’t know you,"" Melin responded. ""You have tweeted out multiple photos of my infant son in a disturbing, misconstrued attempt to advance your political viewpoint. Delete all tweets that include my son. I’ve reported your behavior to Twitter. Thank you."" Social media users claim that Biden is a pedophile. There is zero evidence — no accusations, testimonies, arrests or investigations — that gives this claim any credibility. Photos that supposedly support the claim are taken out of context or have been directly contradicted by the families involved.

Graph showing rising human trafficking arrests under Trump draws on bogus data
","A viral image on Facebook draws on unofficial data from questionable sources to imply that human trafficking arrests have risen dramatically since President Donald Trump took office.  On Aug. 9, the Facebook page Crusader Operator posted a bar graph that purports to show the yearly number of human trafficking arrests from 2010 to 2018.  According to the graph, the number of human trafficking arrests per year ranged from 300 to 1,952 during the Obama presidency, and then skyrocketed after Trump became president, to 3,213 in 2017 and then to 5,987 in 2018. The graph is decorated with images of a frowning Obama over the bars representing 2010-16, and a smiling Trump for 2017 and 2018. The implication is that the apparent rise in arrests during the Trump years is due to the president’s leadership.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As posted to Facebook, the graph doesn’t specify any sources. Nor does it clarify whether it purports to represent federal arrests, state arrests, or both. However, an uncropped version of the graph, posted to Reddit in June 2018, cites two links showing where the numbers originated. (The Reddit page has since been banned.) That graph says the data for the years 2010-16 are taken from a Washington Examiner article, which accurately cites official arrest figures from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. However, the data for 2017 and 2018 come from a public dashboard that cites bogus numbers gathered by followers of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.  Researcher Travis View, who hosts a podcast analyzing the QAnon movement and other conspiracy theories, debunked the QAnon numbers when they first appeared in 2018 on various far-right Internet outlets. Over the course of his investigation, View found that the data comes from now-banned subreddits, 8Chan threads, and Google spreadsheets, where QAnon followers compiled news articles and press releases about human trafficking and tallied arrests. ""Their entire methodology for counting human trafficking arrests was fatally flawed,"" View told PolitiFact in an interview. ""They didn’t discriminate between ICE and other law enforcement agencies. They didn’t make distinctions between charges and arrests. They didn’t count arrests that weren’t reported in the news."" QAnon followers promote or believe an unsubstantiated narrative that Trump and the military are working together to take down a powerful sex trafficking ring, which counts the Obamas and the Clintons among its members. Followers of the conspiracy theory, therefore, have a vested interest in proving that human trafficking arrests have increased under Trump.  According to official numbers, this isn’t the case. An ICE spokesperson shared with us the official arrest figures for the years 2017 and 2018, and they show that yearly human trafficking arrests have actually decreased since the final years of the Obama presidency. In 2017, ICE made 1,602 human trafficking arrests. In 2018, it made 1,588 arrests. This chart shows the official annual arrest figures over the 2010-18 span: The figures that ICE gave us are consistent with numbers that the Trump White House has previously cited in press releases.  A graph shared on Facebook appears to show that the number of human trafficking arrests increased dramatically under President Donald Trump. Official figures from ICE show that the numbers in the graph for 2017 and 2018 are not accurate. According to ICE, arrests went down in 2017 and 2018 compared with 2016. The numbers in the viral graphic combine arrest figures obtained through two wildly different methods of data gathering to make a misleading claim about human trafficking and further an unfounded conspiracy theory.

No, not all of these photos are from the 1918 flu pandemic
","Women in gas masks, others with bags on their heads and stay at home posters. If posts on social media are to be believed, these images and more come from the 1918 flu pandemic. ""Photos from the 1918 flu pandemic,"" proclaimed one such recent Facebook post that contained 11 photos. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact conducted reverse image searches to determine the origins of the photos. Of the 11 photos, six bear no connection to the 1918 flu pandemic. Let’s take a look at those first. The first photo features two women with what look like bags over their heads. According to the Associated Press, it was captured in November 1953. ""War surplus gas capes are used by Meriel Bush, left, and Ruth Neuer, in an attempt to dodge the eye-stinging effects of a low-hanging smog and smoke which enveloped Philadelphia for the second straight day,"" reads the AP’s caption. A reverse image search located the image of masked women walking arm in arm on a stock photo website. On the site, the photo is described as, ""Ladies' fashion from 1913. New veil fashions, based on Turkish nose veils."" When debunking claims that the photo was of the 1918 flu pandemic, AFP Fact Check’s bureau in Thailand contacted the German photo agency, Süddeutsche Zeitung Photo, which was listed as the photographer.  ""The original picture description says that the nose veils were the fashion for ladies after the Balkan war,"" Süddeutsche Zeitung’s spokesperson told AFP in an email. The Balkan Wars unfolded from 1912 to 1913. A photo of women in gas masks tending to a stroller is from a June 1941 gas test during World War II, according to Getty Images. ""9th June 1941: A gas masked young mother attends to her child's pram gas mask during a surprise gas test in Kingston,"" reads the Getty Images photo description. One of the images from the post is an advertisement for a Bell Telephone Co. ""People who are in quarantine are not isolated if they have a Bell Telephone,"" the ad reads. Back in May, Snopes.com debunked the claim that this ad was connected to the 1918 pandemic.  Versions of this ad existed as early as November 1910. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch ran an ad that was nearly identical, but with a different tag, ""The Bell Telephone Company of Missouri.""  The ad mentions ""quarantine"" and ""the sick,"" but there is no indication it is a direct reference to any particular illness. An image of an ad that encouraged people to stay home was created not in 1918, but in 2020. ""Stay At Home,"" the ad says. ""It has never been easier to save lives."" Though the graphic illustration may appear vintage, it was made in March in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic. A French illustrator named Mathieu Persan made versions of the poster in various languages and posted them on Twitter. If you look closely, you can see his signature on the right side of the illustration. A photo of two women who appear to be visiting over a car window while wearing masks was taken in 1929, during a separate flu epidemic.  ""Two women wearing flu masks during a flu epidemic in 1929,"" reads Getty Images’ photo description. The 1928-29 flu epidemic was studied by health professionals using data from the 1918 pandemic. Here’s what we can tell you about the five photos that are actually from the 1918 influenza pandemic time period. A reverse image search identified a photo of a woman wearing a mask as a Getty Images stock photo from February 1919. ""A woman wearing a flu mask during the flu epidemic which followed the First World War,"" reads Getty Images’ caption. A photo showing a sign on a streetcar proclaims, ""Spit spreads death."" A reverse image search revealed the New York Times had used this photo as a feature image for a story about the 1918 flu. Crediting the photo to the Historical Medical Library of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, the Times caption reads, ""An anti-spitting sign posted on streetcar in Philadelphia, October 1918."" An image shows rows of beds used for treating flu patients from the 1918 pandemic, according to Getty Images. The photo was featured in Wired and Business Insider stories about the visuals from the 1918 flu pandemic. ""All theatres closed until further notice at request of mayor,"" reads a sign behind a young boy. The photo was used in a story published by the Seattle Times in July. Credited to the Museum of History & Industry, the Times’ caption reads, ""A masked newsboy looks west outside the closed Pantages Theatre box office during the influenza pandemic of nearly 102 years ago. Likely, the photo was taken between Oct. 5 and Nov. 11, 1918."" It was also used in the museum’s webinar about the 1918 pandemic. And a news announcement with a Red Cross nurse wearing a mask is legitimately from 1918, according to The Washington Post and The Guardian. ""A Red Cross nurse wears a gauze mask over her nose and mouth in this 1918 imaged published in the Illustrated Current News of New Haven, Conn.,"" the Washington Post reported in its description of the photo. A Facebook post claims 11 photos are ""photos from the 1918 flu pandemic.""  This is not the case. Five of the 11 photos are from the 1918 influenza pandemic time period; six are not.

Viral photo questioning Kamala Harris’s race does not show her with her parents

Fact-checking Joe Biden’s claim on asylum seekers in Mexico
","Former Vice President Joe Biden criticized President Donald Trump’s immigration policies as cruel and inhumane and said that under Trump, immigrants for the first time ever were having to seek asylum outside the United States. Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said he would change that. ""Are those asylum seekers that are on the other side of the border now in camps going to be allowed to come and do their claims inside the United States, something that has not been reported to them?"" NPR’s Lulu Garcia-Navarro asked Biden. ""There’s got to be an orderly process for that to occur, as your colleague said,"" Biden said. ""This is the first time ever you’ve had to seek asylum in a third country. It’s outrageous. It’s outrageous. It’s wrong."" The interview, aired Aug. 6, was with members of the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. PolitiFact decided to fact-check Biden on whether it was true that asylum seekers for the first time ever ""had to seek asylum in a third country."" Biden’s campaign did not provide information to PolitiFact supporting his statement. In the interview, Garcia-Navarro and Alfredo Corchado, a border correspondent for the Dallas Morning News, asked Biden about asylum seekers in camps in Mexico. So we’ll use that context to evaluate the claim. Experts said it was unprecedented for people to be moved out of the United States after initiating an asylum claim here. That’s been the case under a Trump policy and has led to thousands of migrants setting up temporary camps in border towns in Mexico. Under the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, Central Americans who request asylum in the United States are sent to Mexico to wait for a resolution of their case. In this context, Mexico is the third country. However, people are not sent to Mexico to seek asylum there, but to wait for a decision on their U.S. case. Under the Migrant Protection Protocols policy, also called ""Remain in Mexico,"" Central Americans who arrive at the southwest border and ask for asylum in the United States are not let into the country as their cases make their way through the immigration system. Instead, they are sent to Mexico to wait there for the duration of their case, which can take months. The policy, initiated by the Trump administration, has prompted thousands of migrants to live in makeshift camps in Mexican border towns. Human rights groups say migrants in these camps lack basic necessities and have fallen victim to gangs, kidnapping, sexual assault, exploitation, abuse and other dangers. It’s the first time that the United States has had a program like Remain in Mexico, in which people who submit asylum claims in the United States are not allowed to be in the country during that process and instead are sent to wait in another country, said Susan Fratzke, a policy analyst with Migration Policy Institute. In 2002, the United States and Canada entered into a safe-third-country agreement, so we asked immigration experts how that factored into Biden’s claim. A key difference between that George W. Bush-era agreement and Trump’s Remain in Mexico program is that under the 2002 agreement, people who apply for asylum in the United States are not sent to Canada while the U.S. case proceeds, they said. Rather, asylum seekers have to request protection in the first of the two countries they arrived in (unless they qualify for an exception). If a person arrives at a U.S.-Canada land border port of entry and requests asylum in the United States, U.S. immigration officials have to determine whether that person should be returned to Canada to seek asylum there first, based on the terms of the 2002 agreement, and vice versa. The agreement was a Canadian initiative and has limited the number of asylum applications submitted in Canada by people who were first in the United States, said Charanya Krishnaswami, advocacy director for the Americas at Amnesty International USA. In July, a court in Canada said the 2002 agreement violated Canada’s constitution.The Canadian government was given six months to respond to the court’s findings. Immigration experts also said that the U.S.-Canada agreement was established under the assumption that both are safe countries equipped to process and offer asylum to qualifying migrants. ""This is not the case with the countries with which the Trump administration has recently entered into new agreements,"" said Parker Sheffy, a clinical supervising attorney at the Immigration Clinic at the University of Houston Law Center. Sheffy and Krishnaswami pointed to Asylum Cooperative Agreements that the Trump administration reached in 2019 with El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Under those agreements, the United States can send people seeking asylum in the U.S. to those Central American countries to request asylum there instead. The goal of those agreements is to limit asylum claims in the United States. The agreements ""can apply theoretically to any asylum seeker — regardless whether they actually even transited through the country to which the U.S. is seeking to send them,"" Krishnaswami said. A March blog post from the Bipartisan Policy Center said the agreements with Central American countries were ""a distinct new category of asylum agreements that reflect the Trump administration’s efforts to discourage asylum seekers from traveling to the U.S.-Mexico border."" Asked about asylum seekers in camps in Mexico, Biden said ""This is the first time ever you've had to seek asylum in a third country."" Biden made that statement after being asked about people in camps in Mexico waiting to find out if the U.S. grants them asylum protection. Immigration experts told us that Trump’s ""Remain in Mexico"" policy is unprecedented. Under that policy, asylum seekers are sent to Mexico to wait for a decision on their U.S. case (not to seek asylum there instead). The United States reached a safe-third-country agreement with Canada in 2002. But experts said there were key differences between that agreement and the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy. Under the 2002 agreement, asylum seekers have to request protection in the first of the two countries they arrive in. If a person is able to submit an asylum claim in the United States, they are not sent to Canada to wait for a decision on the U.S. case.

Was Central Park once a town called Seneca Village?
","A viral TikTok post says New York City’s Central Park once was a town called Seneca Village. The video, which was later removed from the platform, boasted over 3 million views. It’s preserved in this tweet. In the video, TikTok user Hannah Stater said in part, ""Central Park actually used to be a town called Seneca Village that was founded by freed African American slaves in 1825."" She added that the residents were evicted and that this history is not well known because it’s ""uncomfortable."" This description is largely accurate. From 1825 to 1857, Seneca Village consisted of the land between 82nd and 89th Streets and 7th and 8th Avenues. The land was purchased by a white couple, John and Elizabeth Whitehead, in 1824. It was soon subdivided into smaller plots. Columbia University's Seneca Village Project has identified Seneca Village as the first significant community of African American property owners in Manhattan. On Sept. 27,1825, Andrew Williams, a young African American, purchased three lots from the Whiteheads for $125.  The same day, trustees of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church purchased six lots near 86th Street. Those trustees included Epiphany Davis, an African American store clerk, who purchased twelve lots for $578. These transactions provided the nucleus for Seneca Village. There were three churches, a school and several cemeteries.  The land ""was occupied by various groups, including the African American and Irish residents of Seneca Village, as well as scattered small German farmers and Irish households,"" Elizabeth Blackmar, a Columbia University historian, told PolitiFact. By 1855, the community had grown to 264 residents, as German and Irish immigrants integrated into the village, according to the New York Times.  Map of Seneca Village circa 1857 By the 1840s, lower Manhattan, the original core of the city, had become unsanitary and overcrowded. Affluent and civic-minded New Yorkers grew concerned that commerce and industry were sullying the island. According to the New-York Historical Society, some leading residents resented an influx of poor immigrants and considered how to create new neighborhoods for wealthier New Yorkers. Between 1849 and 1853, New Yorkers debated how a ""grand"" park might be constructed to stretch from midtown to northern Manhattan could be created.  ""In the summer of 1853, the city government authorized taking the land between 59th and 106th Streets, between Fifth and Eighth Avenues, to lay grounds for a public park. The city claimed the right of ‘eminent domain,’ which permits the state to take private land for public use, with compensation afforded to the land owners,"" wrote the New-York Historical Society. Seneca Village was directly in the path of the planned park.  ""All residents were forced to vacate beginning in 1856,"" the historical society wrote, ""Approximately 1,600 people, spread over 7,500 lots of land, were directly affected by this decision. Nearly 300 of them lived in Seneca Village."" The New-York Historical Society has noted that to ease evictions, popular newspapers and magazines at the time portrayed the site of the future park as a ""wasteland"" occupied by ""squatters,"" ""shanties,"" ""bloodsuckers"" and ""insects."" But many of the residents fought to keep their land and requested higher compensation.  Ultimately, Seneca Village residents were given final notice to leave in the summer of 1856. Residents were compensated for their land, but many didn’t want to leave or said their land was undervalued in the process, according to a history from the Central Park Conservancy.  ""That's how Central Park was made, with most newspapers cheering the removal of ‘the insects,’"" wrote the New York Times. Some Seneca Village residents moved to different parts of the city, to Long Island, or out of New York state. Williams’ family ultimately settled in California.  ""By 1857, a substantial community with deep spiritual and familial ties— some that went back more than thirty years—had vanished without leaving much evidence of its past,"" the New-York Historical Society wrote. The TikTok video said, ""Central Park actually used to be a town called Seneca Village"" founded by African Americans in 1825. Many of the earliest residents of Seneca Village were African Americans, and they were evicted through eminent domain before the park was built.  The brief history on the TikTok does leave out some of the details, including that Irish and German immigrants were also residents of Seneca Village and that Seneca Village only accounted for a fraction of what became Central Park.

Yes, high percentage of Wisconsin renters are at risk of eviction
","With talks between the White House and Democrats in Congress on a COVID-relief plan at a standstill, President Donald Trump has issued a series of executive orders related to student loans, payroll taxes, unemployment benefits and evictions. The issue of evictions has been at the forefront in recent months as the pandemic-driven economic crisis has left many people unemployed and struggling to pay bills, particularly for housing. Trump’s move does not extend a ban on evictions. Instead, the order directs the Treasury Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to look for ways to prevent evictions. Even before the Aug. 8, 2020 announcement by Trump, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin was underlining the stakes when it comes to eviction. ""34 percent of Wisconsin renters are at risk of eviction,"" the party tweeted Aug. 2, 2020.  More than 1-in-three Wisconsin renters at risk of eviction?  Let’s take a look.  When asked to provide backup for the claim, Philip Shulman, director of press strategy for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a July 27, 2020 CNBC report headlined ""How the eviction crisis is going to look across the U.S."" The CNBC report is based on an analysis released July 22, 2020 from the firm Stout Risius Ross, which found that widespread unemployment has left 40% of renter households nationwide at risk of eviction. In its state-by-state breakdown, Wisconsin fell in the middle, with 34% of households at risk.  Stout is a Chicago-based valuation advisory, investment banking, dispute consulting and management consulting firm. The firm arrived at its percentages by analyzing data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s ""Household Pulse"" survey, taken from July 9 to July 14 and released July 22, 2020.  (A more recent update showed the at-risk-of-eviction percentage down slightly, but we are rating this based on what was known at the time the claim was made.)  The ""Household Pulse"" survey is a collaboration of five federal agencies -- including the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- that gathers data on the effect of COVID-19 on American households.  The survey asks people about their own situation, including employment status, spending patterns, food security, housing, physical and mental health, access to health care, and educational disruption. So, the Democrats are on target with the percentage in the report. Let’s look at how it is playing out. There were only 365 eviction filings across Wisconsin in all of May of 2020, according to online court records, due to a two-month ban on evictions by Gov. Tony Evers.  The ban expired May 27.  That was followed by a huge spike in June, which tallied 3,048 evictions. Meanwhile, there was a drop to 2,430 eviction cases in July, according to online court records.   Rachel E. Fox Armstrong, communications manager for Legal Action of Wisconsin, acknowledged the numbers declined a bit in July, but said it’s important to keep in mind the spike in June.  ""There are a lot of factors at play when considering why there was a decrease in July, and it would be difficult to determine exactly why it occurred,"" Armstrong said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Some possibilities include rental assistance, people finally receiving stimulus checks that had been delayed, the pandemic unemployment assistance, enhanced unemployment, and people who were delayed in receiving unemployment finally gaining access to it."" Armstrong said that community-based organizations and municipalities, including Dane and Milwaukee counties, have been able to make economic resources available to tenants right around when the state eviction ban ended -- for instance, rental assistance funded by the federal CARES act.  ""We suspect that the timing of the availability of those resources may have had a hand in bringing the filing rate down after tenants began to access them,"" Armstrong said.  Armstrong, warned however, that the decrease in evictions may not be permanent. ""We are anxious over what sort of spike we will see now that the federal moratorium has ended, enhanced unemployment benefits end, and as rental assistance resources begin to dry up,"" Armstrong said.  The Democratic Party of Wisconsin said ""34 percent of Wisconsin renters are at risk of eviction.""  A national analysis using U.S. Census Bureau data found that the 34% figure was on target, based on the most recent data available at the time.  Going beyond the survey and looking at actual filings, Wisconsin’s eviction cases showed a massive increase from May to June, but a decrease in July. That adds an asterisk to this claim.

Joe Biden said there is no 'game plan' to distribute coronavirus vaccine. Is he right?
","Scientists have expressed cautious optimism that a vaccine will be ready in the spring of 2021 (and President Donald Trump has hinted at an even more aggressive timeline). But that has raised a key question: Does the federal government have a plan to distribute it? Former Vice President Joe Biden says no.  ""If the vaccine came out tomorrow, how in the heck would we get it to people? There is no game plan they have,"" Biden told associations that represent Black and Hispanic journalists Aug. 6. ""How would everybody in America have access to it? It is a gigantic problem to distribute, even if we have it, and that’s what we should be planning for now, not when we get it."" The federal government has not yet released a plan about how it will distribute vaccines. But in the past two weeks, federal officials have spoken about vaccine distribution planning, including the role of the Defense Department. And committees are working on recommendations about how to distribute the vaccine, while the CDC asked a few to join a pilot program to plan for distribution. ""There is no national COVID-19 vaccination distribution plan, yet. So that is true,"" said Michael Fraser, CEO of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. Most of the experts we spoke with said the government’s efforts have been too slow, and states face too many unknowns to do their part in planning to vaccinate millions of people.  ""This is going to be the most challenging, complex mass vaccination program ever attempted,"" said Dr. Kelly Moore, who works at the Immunization Action Coalition and ran Tennessee's H1N1 vaccination program. It’s not yet known precisely when the vaccine will be available to the public. Six vaccines are in the third phase of testing that involves thousands of patients. Like earlier phases, this one looks at the safety of a vaccine, but it also examines effectiveness and collects more data on side effects. Results of the third phase will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. After the FDA licenses the vaccine, recommendations will be given about who should get the vaccine, and distribution will follow, said Dr. Carol Baker, a pediatrician who is an alternate liaison to a COVID-19 vaccines working group. Federal health officials have generally predicted that the vaccine will be available in early 2021.  There are two committees working on recommendations for the CDC about vaccine distribution. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a long-standing committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, formed a COVID-19 vaccines working group in April. The group’s next meeting on Aug. 26 will be publicly live streamed. Recommendations about who should get the vaccine first are expected by the fall. The committee has wrestled with questions about whether to prioritize groups who have been infected at higher rates, such as Black and Latino people. Another difficult question is defining who is an essential worker.  ""There is no right answer there,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, a liaison to the working group. ""Grocery store workers vs. long haul truckers vs. people who work to keep the electrical grid up ... you can go on and on. Your priority list is valid, but so is mine."" In July, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and the National Academy of Medicine formed a committee to help make a plan for vaccine distribution.  Some experts told us it’s unclear why there are two separate committees working on the same task, while others said the CDC group will be the key group to make recommendations to the CDC. One key question has been about Trump’s comments that the military would be involved with logistics of vaccine distribution, a first. Trump told reporters July 28 that the military is ""all mobilized. It’s been fully set up. When we have that vaccine, it will be discharged and taken care of. It’ll be a very rapid process all over the country."" But a McClatchy report the next day cast doubt on Trump’s statements. Two defense officials told McClatchy that the military commands most likely to be involved in a delivery strategy had not been asked to prepare one. A Health and Human Services official told McClatchy that military help may not be required at all, and it would be the exception, not the norm. A Biden campaign spokesman pointed to the conflicting statements to argue that no distribution plan exists. Following McClatchy’s article, administration officials held a conference call with reporters about vaccination distribution. (For our fact-check, the White House and other administration officials directed us to the transcript of that press phone call.) A senior administration official said the Defense Department will handle the logistics of distribution and ""kitting,"" which means the packaging of the vaccine, along with related equipment, including needles, syringes and vials. The CDC will handle tracking of patients following vaccination and communications with state health departments.  An official said that the distribution will be different from the seasonal flu vaccine because the government will actively target vulnerable groups, such as people in nursing homes and frontline health care workers. Another key piece of vaccine distribution planning lies with the states.  The CDC launched a pilot program with North Dakota, Florida, California and Minnesota as well as the city of Philadelphia to work on a vaccination response, according to a letter written by Nancy Messonnier, a CDC official, Aug. 4.  While the letter says that the pilot program will be a model for other states, it doesn’t give states much time to receive and implement the best practices from that pilot program.  The states have until the end of September to develop vaccination plans that will then be reviewed by the CDC and Operation Warp Speed, the federal government’s effort to fasttrack the availability of vaccines. Those plans should include mass vaccination clinics, signing agreements with providers and identifying high-risk communities that will require additional outreach. ""States must be allowed sufficient time to absorb what has been learned in these pilots and customize it to their own specific state and needs,"" said James Blumenstock, chief program officer for health security at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. ""Everyone questions if all of that can be done successfully between now and Sept 30."" States can build off of their existing programs to administer childhood vaccines and the seasonal flu shot, and the H1N1 vaccine in 2009. But the delivery of COVID-19 vaccine poses some additional challenges. For example: H1N1 was a single dose vaccine. The federal government has told states to prepare for a two-dose COVID-19 vaccine that will need to be administered likely three or four weeks later.  While about 90 million people received the H1N1 vaccine, the federal government is planning for 300 million people to receive COVID-19. Vaccines may have cold storage rules of around minus 80 degrees Celsius, far colder than other vaccines. ""We’ve never distributed a vaccine that required that before,"" Moore said. ""We don’t have a cold chain that exists currently that can take that."" States have been directed to write plans for distribution without knowing important details about the vaccines and how much federal money they will receive to help with an unprecedented vaccination effort. ""Vaccination planning efforts are not as far along as they should be if the first COVID-19 vaccines actually do become available for shipping as early as late 2020,"" Moore said. ""Much of this delay has come from confusion at the federal level about who is directing the implementation of the national vaccination program. States cannot make firm plans with their private sector partners until these basic decisions are made at the federal level and until they are told how the federal government intends for vaccines to reach them."" Biden said that ""if the vaccine came out tomorrow, how in the heck would we get it to people? There is no game plan."" Biden is correct that there isn’t a detailed vaccine distribution plan written by the federal government at this time. But the vaccine isn’t coming out tomorrow, and a federal plan is in the works. There are committees working on recommendations for vaccine distribution to include which groups should get the vaccine first. The CDC also asked four states and a city to pilot a program for vaccine distribution. Nationwide, states are expected to submit their own vaccination distribution plans by the end of September to the federal government. There are a lot of unanswered questions that will affect vaccine distribution. But the planning is happening.

No, Ruth Bader Ginsburg didn’t say she wanted to lower the age of consent
","Fans of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg may be surprised to learn that, at least according to a post being shared widely on Facebook, she once advocated for lowering the age of consent to tween.  ""The age of consent for sexual acts must be lowered to age 12 years old,"" reads the quote attributed to ""Ruth Traitor Ginsburg"" in 1977. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The claim is an old one, raised back in 1993 during Ginsburg’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Susan Hirschmann, executive director of the conservative Eagle Forum, then said that among Ginsburg’s ""extremist feminist concepts"" was the belief that ""the age of consent for sexual acts must be lowered to 12 years old.""  Hirschmann cited ""Sex Bias in the U.S. Code,"" a report co-authored by Ginsburg and published by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in 1977. The report mentions ""consent"" in a few places.  On page 95, the report describes the current law at the time — ""it is a crime for a person to have carnal knowledge of a female not his wife who has not reached 16 years of age"" — and notes that rape was then defined as anyone ""who commits an act of sexual intercourse with a female not his wife, by force or without her consent.""  ""The ‘statutory rape’ offense is defined in these sections in much the same way,"" the report says. ""The victim must be a female and the offender a male. … These provisions clearly fail to comply with the equal rights principle. They fail to recognize that women of all ages are not the only targets of sexual assault; men and boys can also be victims of rape. In the case of statutory rape, the immaturity and vulnerability of young people of both sexes could be protected through appropriately drawn, sex-neutral proscriptions."" The report goes on to suggest changes to the current law to remove sex bias, such as changing federal law to extend Secret Service protections to ""the spouse or surviving spouse of a woman president"" instead of just the wife or widow of the president. Toward the end of page 101, the report suggests changing another law and quotes a proposed Senate bill, which used gender-neutral language to describe the victim of a crime: A person is guilty of an offense if they compelled someone to participate in a sexual act using coercion, drugging them, or if ""the other person is, in fact, less than 12 years old."" ""This report recommends alteration of pronoun usage throughout the Senate bill… to conform with the proposed sex-neutral terminology format,"" the report then says. Bottom line: The words weren’t Ginsburg’s, and they weren’t used to express support for the proposal — the purpose was to demonstrate gender-neutral language. Still, this section of the report has inspired many false claims and fact-checks over the years. In 2005, Slate published a story about the claim after Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Ginsburg ""wants the age of consent to be 12.""

Joe Biden!"" it says.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Reuters and AFP have already found it to be inaccurate. Public property records for the U.S. Virgin Islands, a U.S. territory, show no results as of Aug. 11 for Joe Biden. They do show results for Biden’s younger brother James and his wife Sara.  James Biden bought an acre of land with ocean views on nearby Water Island in 2005 and later resold a third of it to a lobbyist, according to a January report from Politico. Google Maps shows Water Island is slightly over 8 miles from Little St. James, which Epstein purchased in 1998. The Politico report said it was not clear whether Joe Biden was aware of his brother’s dealings related to the Water Island property. The former vice president has vacationed elsewhere on the island at least three times, the report said. But there’s no sign of any ownership by Joe Biden. There’s no reference to any Caribbean property in Biden’s financial disclosures from 2020 and 2019 or his federal tax returns from 2018, 2017 and 2016, as other fact-checkers have noted. Those forms are available on his campaign website. PolitiFact also found no credible reports of Biden owning a Caribbean island on Google or the Nexis news database. Biden campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates told AFP that Biden ""does not and never has"" owned any property in the U.S. Virgin Islands or anywhere else in the Caribbean. Biden and his wife Jill own two properties in Delaware, where Biden served as a senator for decades. They have their primary residence in Wilmington, and another home in Rehoboth Beach. They also rent a home in McLean, Va., according to the Washington Post. According to Google Maps, the nearest islands to Epstein’s Little St. James are Great St. James Island, which Epstein also bought in 2016, and Dog Island. As AFP first reported, Google Maps shows no obvious buildings or other signs of habitation on Dog Island. The Facebook image also says the FBI found ""multiple skeletons"" in the water around Epstein’s island. PolitiFact previously examined online claims that the bones of children were found on Epstein’s island. We rated those claims False. A Facebook post says Biden owns a private island next to Epstein’s. There’s no public evidence that’s the case. The recorder of deeds for the U.S. Virgin Islands, which includes Esptein’s Little St. James, shows no results in its database for Joe Biden.  We rate this post Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2020/aug/11/facebook-posts/no-joe-biden-doesnt-own-private-island-near-jeffre/

Facebook post misleadingly says Trump payroll tax action only suspends employer match
","President Donald Trump’s weekend order to give millions of workers a break on payroll taxes caught many people by surprise, and created a range of reactions, criticism and questions. One post on Facebook described the order as a scam that won’t affect your take-home pay. ""When Trump says he wants to suspend ‘payroll tax,’ he's talking about the 7.65% withheld for your Social ‘Security’ and Medicare. ~ Here's the scam: it would suspend the 7.65% your employer matches. See? You will NOT get that, nor will your wage or salary increase by 7.65%. Plus, when Social ‘Security’ collapses due to this de-funding, It WILL PROVIDE AN EXCUSE TO PRIVATIZE [steal it],"" the post said. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  In this case, the post is wrong on its first point, but does raise legitimate questions, even if it predicts the future with too much certainty.  On suspending the employer’s match, the worker’s and employer’s contributions are already separate. Under the March COVID-19 relief bill, the CARES Act, the employer portion is on hold until the end of the year. The CARES Act says  that companies need to pay back half by the end of 2021 and the other rest by the end of 2022.  As for whether a worker will see the extra money, employers could decide not to pass along the deferral. Some business advisers are suggesting they do that as a hedge against uncertainty. We don’t know what employers will do, but this is a possibility. A Facebook post claims, Trump’s plan ""would suspend the 7.65% your employer matches. See? You will NOT get that, nor will your wage or salary increase by 7.65%"" The employer and employee payroll tax contributions are already separate, and the government already had deferred employer payment until the end of 2020. Trump’s action applies to the employee contribution, and it’s yet unknown if that deferral will reach the pockets of employees and when.

Facebook post misleadingly says Trump payroll tax action helps only employers, not employees
","President Donald Trump’s weekend order to give millions of workers a break on payroll taxes caught many people by surprise, and created a range of reactions, criticism and questions. One Facebook post said the order doesn’t help workers, it helps employers. ""Let me splain how ‘no payroll taxes’ helps you, it doesn’t. It helps employers & defunds years of Social Security you already paid,"" the post said. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  It’s actually hard to see how Trump’s action helps employers, as the Facebook post claims. Many observers say it makes life harder for employers, because it’s unclear where things will stand next year after the election. Payroll taxes flow through employers. If they simply let workers keep the money, they could need to pay back the amount deferred in fairly short order, depending on the next president and Congress. ""They would be risking their decision to defer based on a very uncertain political outcome this fall and thus potentially face a significant payment to the Trust Funds early next year,"" said William Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank. Right after Trump announced his move, the business magazine Inc. published an article that echoed Hoagland’s point, telling businesses ""the prudent thing is to hold tight and not change withholdings."" Economist Eugene Steuerle at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center said a future Congress would be ""unlikely"" to force workers to pay back the amount deferred. ""When it comes to individuals, it’s almost impossible to recoup the money,"" Steuerle said. ""Many people have almost no savings at all."" Again, no one knows for sure what will happen in 2021.

Claim about 'killing' payroll tax and Social Security needs more context
","​President Donald Trump’s weekend order to give millions of workers a break on payroll taxes caught many people by surprise, and created a range of reactions, criticism and questions. One post on Facebook said bluntly, ""Killing the payroll tax means killing Social Security."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This post is misleading. While it’s true that the payroll tax provides nearly 90% of the revenues for Social Security, Congress could decide to use another way to pay for the program. The program’s promise to people exists outside of the funding mechanism.  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told Fox News Sunday that the money would be made up for with dollars from the general fund. The administration can’t promise that on its own. Congress, which controls federal spending, would need to pass a bill to make it happen. Social Security funding will not collapse due to this act alone, said William Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank. And economist Eugene Steuerle at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center told us that in the past, Congress has come through and reimbursed the trust funds.  ""The only effect is to delay the day of reckoning when there is insufficient money left in the trust funds to pay out benefits,"" he said. Funding is critically needed.  As we wrote last year, Social Security is like a forest pond with a stream flowing in at one end and water flowing out the other. If the pond is shrinking, there are only three ways to save it: increase the amount coming in (higher taxes), reduce the amount going out (cut some benefits), or count on rain from above to fill the pond (get a higher return on money in the trust funds today). The Social Security Administration compiled a list of legislative ideas that would extend the life of the trust funds. By and large, the bills in Congress now rely on option No.1 –– raising taxes to pay for future benefits. The number crunchers at Social Security estimated how much longer the trust funds would last under the different proposals. The government’s maximum time frame is 75 years, or 2093, and one bill achieved that. The package from Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., would gradually raise the current combined employer-employee payroll tax of 12.4% to 14.8% by 2043. The rate would go up one-tenth of a percent each year. Their package also changes the rule for high earners. They would apply the payroll tax to earnings over $400,000. Today, the maximum taxable amount is just shy of $138,000. The specifics vary, but other bills extend the solvency of the trust funds by making similar changes — raising the payroll tax for everyone and applying the tax for the first time to earnings above a certain level. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., co-sponsored a plan with Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., that would stretch the life of the trust funds to 2071. It would apply payroll taxes to income over $250,000 and levy a new 6.2% tax on investment income for couples making over $250,000 a year. In response to Trump’s executive action, a post on Facebook claimed, ""Killing the payroll tax means killing Social Security."" Trump’s proposal defers some payments of the payroll taxes, which experts say won’t kill Social Security. But the federal government does need to find ways to fund the program in the long term. That’s not a new problem. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2020/aug/10/facebook-posts/claim-about-killing-payroll-tax-and-social-securit/

No, Donald Trump did not put a hold on evictions through December
","Some Facebook users jumped the gun on a series of executive actions signed by President Donald Trump after bipartisan negotiations on a new coronavirus relief bill ground to a halt. One of the four orders Trump signed on Aug. 8 addressed eviction policy, an urgent matter given the coronavirus pandemic, which has prompted a severe economic downturn and caused many renters to lose their jobs. An eviction moratorium that had been included in the coronavirus relief bill known as the CARES Act expired on July 24 and has not yet been extended. Between 30 million and 40 million people could be at risk of eviction over the next few months without an extended moratorium, the National Low-Income Housing Coalition estimated. The Aug. 8 Facebook post said lawmakers wasted time on negotiations when Trump was taking forceful actions. Trump, the post said, ""put a hold on ALL EVICTIONS through December."" It went on to say that Trump ""is for the people whether you like him or not. This executive order he just signed is going to save a lot of y’all asses."" But it is not accurate to say Trump extended eviction protections until December. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  First, some background on the previous eviction moratorium from the CARES Act. That law, which was passed with almost universal bipartisan support and was signed by Trump on March 27, 2020, provided a 120-day eviction moratorium for renters in specific categories. Those categories included renters who received federal housing assistance (such as by living in public housing or receiving federal financial assistance or tax credits), as well as renters who lived in properties in which the landlord’s mortgage is backed by the federal government, including the mortgage-bundling entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. However, the ban in the CARES Act expired on July 24, and to date, it has not been extended. A different federal eviction moratorium is still in place, but it is set to end on Aug. 31. That one, imposed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, pauses mortgages and evictions for single-family homes that have mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Separately, renters may have protections under state or local policies. Trump’s executive order falls well short of extending the moratorium from the CARES Act. Instead, it tells executive branch officials to think about possible solutions rather than formally imposing a moratorium. (The executive order also doesn’t mention extending anything ""through December."") Here are the key provisions of Trump’s order: • It tells the Health and Human Services secretary and the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ""consider whether any measures temporarily halting residential evictions of any tenants for failure to pay rent are reasonably necessary."" • It tells the Treasury secretary and Housing and Urban Development secretary to identify federal funds that can be applied to ""temporary financial assistance to renters and homeowners."" • It tells the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency to identify ""resources that may be used to prevent evictions and foreclosures for renters and homeowners"" caused by the pandemic. (As an independent agency, it’s unclear whether the president can order the agency to do anything.) Unlike the CARES Act eviction ban, ""the executive order does not ‘put a hold’ on evictions at all,"" said Andrew Scherer, the policy director of New York Law School’s Impact Center for Public Interest Law. The Facebook post said that Trump ""put a hold on ALL EVICTIONS through December."" That’s incorrect. The executive order tells executive branch officials to think about possible solutions, rather than formally imposing a moratorium, as the now-expired CARES Act language did, at least for properties with a linkage to federal housing finance. The executive order also says nothing about a December deadline. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2020/aug/10/facebook-posts/no-donald-trump-did-not-put-hold-evictions-through/
