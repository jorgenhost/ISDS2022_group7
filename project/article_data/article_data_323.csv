Why the COVID-19 survival rate is not over 99%
","With COVID-19 infections surging in the United States because of the more contagious delta variant, some have downplayed the number of deaths from the virus and the effectiveness of vaccines. To minimize the importance of vaccination, an Instagram post claimed that the COVID-19 survival rate is over 99% for most age groups, while the COVID-19 vaccine’s effectiveness was 94%. The post’s alleged survival rate for COVID-19: 0 - 19 years, 99.997% 20 - 49 years, 99.98% 50 - 69 years, 99.5% 70+ years, 94.6% The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A problem with the post is that it improperly used the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s statistics for modeling pandemic scenarios, not for calculating COVID-19’s survival rate. The CDC recommends the COVID-19 vaccines because they are safe and effective, even against the delta variant. Although the delta variant has slightly decreased the effectiveness of vaccines, experts still encourage vaccination as it provides a high level of protection against hospitalization and death. The Instagram post misrepresents data from the CDC’s COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios document published in September 2020. It was created so public health officials who use mathematical models could help hospitals and policymakers react to different levels of severity of the pandemic. The data does not show the likelihood of surviving COVID-19. These numbers are meant to be used for estimates of death over time, said Dr. Ruth Etzioni, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Washington School of Public Health. PolitiFact in December fact-checked another claim that also misused the CDC data. We found that survival rates are usually calculated over a longer period of time, because death data can sometimes lag for months behind new cases. Most people who get COVID-19 will survive. Of roughly 35.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States, around 614,300 people, or 1.7%, have died, according to Johns Hopkins University’s mortality data as of Aug 6. The CDC issues provisional death counts for COVID-19, but that data should not be used to infer a survival rate. Experts say that during a pandemic, it’s difficult to determine survival rates — such rates are usually calculated for a longer period of time, rather than as a snapshot. The CDC data shows that most people who have died from COVID-19, about 79%, have been people ages 65 and older. People between 45 and 64 years old account for about 18% of COVID-19 deaths, and people under 45 years account for 2.8% of such deaths, according to the CDC’s data as of Aug. 6. (The CDC data isn’t broken down in the same age groups offered in the Instagram post.) Experts believe there’s likely an undercount of COVID-19 deaths. Etzioni said that it’s not useful to just look at the rate that people die, even if it's low, because it doesn’t tell the whole story. ""If more and more younger people are getting COVID, then the total number of young people who die is going to skyrocket,"" Etzioni said. Also, people should not use data on how many people have survived COVID-19 to predict their own chances of surviving infection, experts say. Someone's chances of surviving COVID-19 can vary depending on their age, health, and vaccination status — national statistics don’t account for these factors. At an Aug. 2 press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, discussed three different studies on the Pfizer vaccine's effectiveness against the delta variant. Fauci said the studies showed the vaccine was highly effective in protecting people against symptomatic infection and hospitalization, although the vaccine’s overall effectiveness had decreased since the delta variant emerged. ""The vaccines are doing exactly what we’re asking them to do when it comes to keeping you out of the hospital, out of serious disease, and certainly preventing your death,"" Fauci said. An Instagram post claimed that the COVID-19 survival rate is over 99% for most age groups. The data it cited does not show the likelihood of surviving COVID-19. The post’s claim is based on data used to model pandemic scenarios. Experts say a person cannot determine their own chances at surviving COVID-19 by looking at national statistics, because the data doesn’t take into account the person’s own risks and COVID-19 deaths are believed to be undercounted.  Survival rate data is not yet available from the CDC.

Sweden’s low COVID-19 death tally in July ignores other markers of pandemic’s toll
","From the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, Sweden made itself a compelling case study, forgoing lockdowns and mandates,  keeping its society largely open — and prompting claims that it was faring better with COVID-19 than the United States. Early on, we found such statements were overstated. Now, nearly a year and a half later, as the virus’ delta variant spikes cases, the claims have reemerged. One widely shared on Facebook came from Steve Deace, the host of a show on the conservative Blaze TV streaming network. He has promoted Sweden’s approach as better than the United States’. Alluding to the 27-nation European Union, which includes Sweden, Deace wrote:  ""In the month of July, Sweden recorded a grand total of 9 deaths with Covid in a nation of over 10 million. Lowest mask compliance in EU, least locked down country in EU from beginning, and just 41% fully vaccinated. Also codes Covid deaths similar to how we do."" Deace’s post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post has a point in terms of its characterization of Sweden’s response to the pandemic, its vaccination rate and a relatively small number of COVID-19 deaths in July. But cherry picking one statistic — the raw number of deaths in a single month — leaves a misleading impression of conditions and trends in Sweden. Asked whether he was implying that there is a connection between the July deaths and Sweden’s low vaccination rates, relaxed lockdown rules and low mask compliance, Deace told us: ""I actually trust readers to draw their own conclusions from the data."" In contrast to some of its neighbors and the U.S., Sweden’s society has remained largely open during the pandemic, as the government responded mostly with guidelines, not stay-at-home orders and quarantines. Masks generally were not recommended. In April 2020, in the weeks after the outbreak was declared a pandemic, we looked at two claims that touted Sweden’s more hands-off approach as superior to lockdown policies imposed in Europe and the U.S. We found that infection rate cited in one of these claims was not a reliable indicator of how a country was doing, given that it depended on how much testing was being done; and that Sweden’s COVID-19 death rate was higher than two of its neighbors.  As of Aug. 4, 42% of Sweden’s population was fully vaccinated; that compares with 49% in the U.S. and 50% in the EU, according to Our World in Data. Sweden’s guidelines emphasize staying at home, testing, hand washing and social distancing. We found Sweden’s COVID-19 death counts for July 2021 a bit higher than the nine the post claims. Sweden had a cumulative 14,630 COVID-19 deaths as of July 1, 2021, and 14,655 on July 31 — an increase of 25, according to Our World in Data.  The post looks at deaths only for July 2021. But Sweden has seen wide variations in its COVID-19 caseloads and death toll since last year. By April 2021, there were signs that Sweden’s approach had flaws. At that point, the New Yorker reported, Sweden’s per-capita case counts and death rates were many times higher than any of its Nordic neighbors, all of which imposed lockdowns, travel bans and limited gatherings early on. The latest figures show Sweden’s COVID-19 death rate is lower than in the European Union and the U.S. — but it has more than doubled in the past 10 months.  Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s top epidemiologist, told PolitiFact that the death rate has risen in many countries. ""We have had two severe waves. The excess mortality is comparably low,"" he said. Excess mortality, as defined by the World Health Organization, is the difference between the observed numbers of deaths and the expected number of deaths for a specific time period. Our World in Data’s measure of the seven-day rolling average of COVID-19 deaths per 1 million people shows that Sweden had higher spikes than those in the EU and the U.S. at several points during the pandemic, including early 2020 and early 2021. And for most of this year, its per capita confirmed cases have exceeded the figures for the U.S. and the EU.  
 Overall, Sweden’s COVID-19 death rate of 142.5 per 100,000 population is well above neighbors Denmark (43.89), Finland (17.84), Norway (15.03) and Iceland (8.3), according to Johns Hopkins University.  As for infections, after a wave in the spring of 2021, Sweden saw its infection rate drop, which officials attributed primarily to vaccinations and to people being outdoors more, Reuters reported.  But now it’s on the rise again.  In its latest weekly report, on Aug. 5, the Swedish Public Health Agency reported 3,451 confirmed cases of COVID-19, a 30% increase over the previous week.  Deace claims that Sweden had few COVID deaths in July, despite low vaccination rates, relaxed lockdown rules and low mask compliance. Sweden has imposed fewer restrictions than other countries and had few deaths in July, but its COVID-19 death rate has been above the U.S. and the EU at various times during the pandemic. Sweden has had more COVID-19 deaths per capita than its neighbors, and infections are rising. The post cherry-picks data from a single month, and leaves out substantial context about Sweden’s COVID-19 experience since the pandemic began. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970B5500>],/factchecks/2021/aug/06/steve-deace/swedens-low-covid-19-death-tally-july-ignores-othe/

About 70 percent of U.S. residents expected to live in the 15 largest states in 2040
","Data from 2017 predicting Americans’ domestic migration patterns are resurfacing after J.D. Scholten, a former Democratic nominee for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District and senior policy advisor at American Economic Liberties Project, tweeted July 21:  ""By 2040, 70% of the population is expected to live in just 15 states.""  He linked his comment to an article, ""Rural America’s Population Loss Stems from Outmigration, Not Deaths,"" by The Daily Yonder.    The U.S. Census Bureau defines domestic migration as the movement of people within the nation’s boundaries, from one state to another, while international migration refers to the movement across the boundaries.  Migration has researchers, politicians and others interested in how power in Congress gets distributed. States’ representation in the U.S. House is determined by population, while representation in the U.S. Senate is two senators per state, regardless of size. ""My view of that is that when you look at our democracy, the amount of influence smaller populated states will have by 2040 is going to increase dramatically, where more populated states won’t have the same weight,"" Scholten said in an interview with PolitiFact Iowa.  PolitiFact checked the balance of power question earlier this year and found those concerns to be overstated. But, while we cannot fact-check whether or not something in the future will happen, we can check on whether or not Scholten cites credible population projection data.  Scholten said his tweet is based on a 2017 Wall Street Journal column, ""The Varied—and Global—Threats Confronting Democracy,"" by Gerald Seib. Seib wrote that David Birdsell, a political communications scholar and provost and senior vice president of Kean University, noted that by ""2040, about 70% of Americans are expected to live in the 15 largest states."" In an interview with PolitiFact Iowa, Birdsell, who made his projection while at Baruch College, said figures he quoted for Seib’s article referenced U.S. Census Bureau data analyzed by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia. But while the data are a few years old, they still generally hold up in 2021, he said. The Cooper Center used the most recent population estimates and U.S. Census Bureau data to examine expected changes between 2020 and 2040, the center’s website said. ""Any population projection is exactly that,"" Birdsell said. ""It’s based on circumstances at the time, it’s based on lifespan, It’s based on immigration rates, it’s based on naturalization rates, from among the immigrant population.""  The article, ""How accurate are our 50-State population projections?"" about the Cooper Center’s population projections, states that projections recognized as authentic tend to be accurate within a small percentage margin of U.S. Census Bureau numbers that are released years later. In addition, the article says population projections need to be updated every two or three years to capture accurate population trends.  For analyzing Scholten’s tweet, that means the Cooper Center’s most recent data can have a margin of error, but is still providing comparable projections since 2017, according to The Cooper Center.  According to a Cooper Center article ""National Population Projections: 2020, 2030, 2040"" by Shonel Sen, research and policy analyst for the Demographics Research Group, the top 10 largest states have been ""projected to remain the same across the decades since 2010.""  Data show that some southern states, like Georgia and North Carolina, are gradually growing because the states have younger populations. Meanwhile, populations in smaller states, like Vermont and West Virginia, would be expected to decrease consistently, largely because of people there are aging, the Cooper Center reports. ""California, Texas, Florida and New York continue to dominate the population size charts, with more than a third of the future U.S. population residing in one of these four large states,"" Sen wrote.  According to calculations by PolitiFact using U.S. Census Bureau data and population projections from the Cooper Center, an estimated 67.2 percent of the U.S. population will live in the 15 largest states in 2040.   Scholten said,  ""By 2040, 70% of the population is expected to live in just 15 states.""  The Cooper Center, the catalyst for Scholten’s tweet, has a credible history of national population predictions with small error margins. The center’s data projects that an estimated 67.2 percent of the U.S. population will live in the 15 largest states in 2040, which is close to Scholten’s 70 percent.

Ron DeSantis’ effort to blame COVID-19 spread on migrants is short on evidence
","As coronavirus cases spike nationally, and especially in Florida, a blame game has erupted between President Joe Biden and Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis. Florida has the second-highest per-capita coronavirus case load of any state as of Aug. 6, exceeding its level at any point during the pandemic. Florida also has the highest coronavirus hospitalization rate of any state, at more than three times the national average. Biden pointed this out in remarks on Aug. 3. ""Make no mistake,"" he said. ""The escalation of cases is particularly concentrated in states with low vaccination rates. Just two states, Florida and Texas, account for one-third of all new COVID-19 cases in the entire country. ... Look, we need leadership from everyone. And if some governors aren’t willing to do the right thing to beat this pandemic, then they should allow businesses and universities who want to do the right thing to be able to do it."" DeSantis unloaded on Biden during an Aug. 4 news conference in Panama City, Fla. ""He’s imported more virus from around the world by having a wide open southern border. You have hundreds of thousands of people pouring across every month,"" DeSantis said. ""You have over 100 different countries where people are pouring through. Not only are they letting them through — they're then farming them out all across our communities across this country. Putting them on planes, putting them on buses."" DeSantis doubled down in a fundraising letter later that day: ""Joe Biden has the nerve to tell me to get out of the way on COVID while he lets COVID-infected migrants pour over our southern border by the hundreds of thousands. No elected official is doing more to enable the transmission of COVID in America than Joe Biden with his open borders policies."" Public health experts said it’s reasonable to be concerned about coronavirus spreading among migrants, especially if they’re living in close quarters. ""It would be fair to say that detention centers, like prisons, are likely to be 'hotspots' for transmission,"" said Babak Javid, a professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco. ""We saw a lot of this last year,"" earlier in the pandemic. But they said there is no evidence it’s happening on the scale that DeSantis described. It may well be that immigrants coming illegally into the country are contributing to COVID-19 caseloads, ""but given the extensive transmission already in the U.S., the immigration contribution is akin to pouring a bucket of water into a swimming pool,"" said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. ""It’s hard to measure and pretty trivial."" In a statement, DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw focused on the migrants who make it across the border without detection. She acknowledged that migration is not the only factor in COVID-19 spread. ""We know tens of thousands of migrants cross the border illegally every month,"" she said. ""Officials don’t have a precise number, because the border is porous, and it stands to reason that many people enter undetected. ... Some of those countries where a significant portion of the migrants hail from, such as Haiti, have extremely low rates of COVID vaccination."" Still, it is wrong to say, as DeSantis did, that the southern border is ""wide open"" for everyone to just come into the country. Most people who are encountered are turned away under a public health law invoked by Trump’s administration and continued by Biden. Border officials — at and between ports of entries — recorded more than 822,000 encounters with migrants from February to June, and most of those people were expelled under the public health law. These individuals don’t get to stay in the country to request asylum or other immigration protection. Nicole Hallett, a professor and director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School, told PolitiFact that the apprehension numbers reflect that people trying and failing to cross multiple times. ""Apprehensions have increased because of the strict COVID restrictions, not because restrictions have eased,"" Hallett said. The Biden administration has allowed certain groups of migrants to file for immigration protection, such as children arriving alone at the southern border and some families with young children. The Department of Homeland Security, however, said it had recently resumed expedited removal flights for certain families who recently arrived at the southern border. Officials in February began to let in asylum seekers who were waiting for a resolution of their U.S. immigration cases in Mexico under the Trump-era Remain in Mexico program. (Biden ended that program in June.)  The United States is also temporarily limiting inbound land border crossings from Mexico; non-essential travel is not allowed.  Customs and Border Protection told PolitiFact in April that personnel do initial inspections for symptoms or risk factors associated with COVID-19 and consult with onsite medical personnel, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or local health systems as appropriate. DHS also said in April that it works with state and local authorities and non-governmental organizations to make sure that all migrants are tested for COVID-19 ""at some point during their immigration journey."" This doesn’t mean that the chance of coronavirus spread on the border is zero. For instance, McAllen, Texas, along the border with Mexico, has seen an increasing number of migrants arriving in recent weeks. According to the city, more than 7,000 migrants have tested positive for the coronavirus, out of 87,000 migrants who had passed through the city.  But drawing a clear line between migrants and the spread of the coronavirus throughout the U.S., as DeSantis did, requires a sense of how many migrants are evading detection and how many of them are infected. ""Otherwise, it is a statement without any facts to substantiate it,"" said Nicole Gatto, an associate professor in Claremont Graduate University’s school of community and global health. The data for coronavirus cases provides poor support for the notion that the virus is being spread by illegal immigration. Significant outbreaks are happening well inland from the border, in states like Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky and Missouri. Public health experts express skepticism that illegal border crossings are to blame for these outbreaks.  (This map, by the Washington Post, shows the seven-day average of reported cases for each U.S. county, per 100,000 residents. Reprinted with permission; updated versions available here.) If DeSantis were correct, the land border between the U.S. and Mexico would be among the hardest-hit parts of the country, since even if migrants eventually disperse to other locations, they would have an impact on coronavirus rates locally first.  However, the entire land border between San Diego and the southern tip of Texas shows relatively low case rates compared with the entire southeastern quadrant of the U.S. Given this data, ""it doesn't seem right that illegal immigration is driving the current surge,"" said Javid, the University of California-San Francisco professor. There’s also a more plausible explanation for the coronavirus surge’s current pattern: Case rates are higher in places with lower rates of vaccination. An analysis by the New York Times found that at the end of July, counties with vaccination rates below 30% had coronavirus case rates well over double the case rates in counties with at least 60% vaccination. And five of the six least-vaccinated states — Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi — are all squarely within the geographical quadrant of the country that has the highest case rates. Some of the hardest-hit places, such as southwestern Missouri, are far from the border, while others, such as southern Louisiana, are on the water.  ""The pattern of distribution of coronavirus cases does not correspond in any way to immigrant movement,"" said Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. ""And the paths to ‘bringing’ COVID here are many, including tourists, diplomats, boat workers, student exchange, and cruises."" Caplan said he views DeSantis’ statements as the latest in a long history of efforts to offload blame for infectious diseases on immigrants.  ""The notion of immigrants bringing disease has been alleged about Gypsies, Jews, Italians, Irish, and Blacks,"" he said. ""As we know from Ebola, SARS, and influenza, infections get here all the time. The issue is what we do to stop their spread."" DeSantis said Biden has driven the current coronavirus surge because he ""imported more virus from around the world by having a wide open southern border."" The available evidence shows that coronavirus hot spots tend to be clustered either far from the border or on the water, whereas the entire land border with Mexico has fairly low rates. The hotspot locations tend to correlate with low rates of vaccination among the public. In addition, the U.S. does not have a ""wide open"" border. Most people who are encountered are turned away under a Trump-era policy that Biden continued.

North Carolina AG compares opioid deaths to COVID-19 deaths
","North Carolina’s top prosecutor wants his colleagues to remember that people are still struggling with drug addiction and that the pandemic has exacerbated the opioid crisis. However, his recent comparison of COVID-19 deaths and opioid-related deaths caught our attention. Attorney General Josh Stein was addressing North Carolina’s Council of State — which includes the governor, lieutenant governor, state treasurer and other department heads — when he made this statement: ""The opioid epidemic has become a greater crisis since the pandemic. The media doesn’t cover it as much because obviously the pandemic is paramount. But more people have died of an opioid overdose in North Carolina in recent years than have died of COVID. The number of people who have died of an opioid overdose has dramatically increased over the last year,"" Stein said. Opioids are drugs naturally found in the opium poppy plant. Examples include heroin, morphine, the synthetic opioid known as fentanyl, and prescriptions such as OxyContin and Vicodin. Is it true that more people have died of an opioid overdose in North Carolina in recent years than have died from the coronavirus? Only if we apply the word ""recent"" very liberally. On Aug. 3, the day of Stein’s statement, the state Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) had recorded 13,679 total COVID-19 deaths in North Carolina since the start of the pandemic in 2020. When we asked Stein’s office about his comparison, spokesperson Nazneen Ahmed cited a DHHS estimate that 16,500 North Carolinians unintentionally overdosed and died over 19 years — between 2000 and 2019. However, it’s difficult to determine exactly how many deaths there have been in ""recent"" years. The state’s health department doesn’t have confirmed opioid deaths for 2020, only provisional data. Here are the year-by-year unintentional opioid overdose deaths documented by DHHS: 2020: 2,322 2019: 1,808 2018: 1,718 2017: 1,884 2016: 1,407 2015: 1,057 2014: 853 2013: 721 2012: 731 2011: 713 2010: 648 In total, opioid deaths hit 13,862 over that 11-year span. To put that in perspective, North Carolina recorded 6,748 COVID-19 deaths just in 2020 — nearly three times as many deaths as from opioid overdoses in the same one-year period. DHHS records do show the number of opioid overdoses — fatal and nonfatal — have increased during the pandemic.   DHHS spokeswoman Kelly Haight said the state records show emergency department visits for overdoses have increased 20% since the early months of the pandemic in 2020. ""While we likely will not have complete death data until later this fall, the provisional data that we do share for 2020 and 2021 show this increase as well,"" she said. For the sake of this fact-check, though, it’s important to point out that it’s unlikely that opioid deaths exceed COVID-19 deaths in North Carolina unless you combine more than 10 years of confirmed death figures.  A chart on the CDC’s website shows slightly higher overdose death figures for North Carolina. However, as Haight pointed out, the CDC tracks deaths caused by opioids as well as other substances. Stein said ""More people have died of an opioid overdose in North Carolina in recent years than have died of COVID."" Excluding 2021, it appears as if we’d need to combine more than 10 years of opioid fatality data to reach the same number of coronavirus deaths North Carolina has counted since the start of the pandemic. Preliminary opioid death numbers from 2021 aren’t available and officials haven’t finished confirming the total for 2020, so it’s possible that they’ll push the recent totals higher than expected. But we feel like it’s a stretch for Stein to compare North Carolina’s opioid deaths over the last 11 years to COVID deaths in North Carolina, which total more than 13,700 over 18 months. We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A30BF00>],/factchecks/2021/aug/06/josh-stein/north-carolina-ag-compares-opioid-deaths-covid-19-/

Obviously, I think that you guys should be in Austin, Texas, performing those duties,"" Roy said.  He then proceeded to quiz the trio of state legislators on a variety of voting law specifics, asking them to answer in a yes or no fashion. One of those questions centered on the past remarks of one of their colleagues, state Rep. Rafael Anchía, D-Dallas.  ""In 2007, your colleague, who also happens to be here in D.C., Rafael Anchía said, ‘Vote by mail that we know is the greatest source of voter fraud in this state.’ Do you agree with Rep. Anchía, yes or no?"" Roy asked.  Bernal threw up his hands. ""I have nothing to base the fact that the greatest source of voter fraud is by mail,"" he said.  Roy pointed the question at Collier. ""I’m not sure what the context was,"" Collier said.  State Rep. Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, an architect of the Republican voting legislation, also cited the quote in a clip circulated on Twitter.   A major provision of Republicans' legislation tightens restrictions and increases requirements related to mail-in voting in two ways. It would ban county election officials from sending unsolicited mail-in voting applications to eligible registered voters and it would add new ID requirements to vote-by-mail applications.  In the clip, Anchía is speaking in 2007 against House Bill 218, one of the Legislature’s first attempts to pass a voter ID law to combat allegations of widespread voter impersonation. (That bill was defeated in the Senate that year, although a similar voter ID bill was resurrected and passed four years later.)  The quote comes from remarks Anchía made on April 23, 2007, in which he was attempting to dissuade his colleagues from voting for the bill. According to Anchía, the bill suffered two weaknesses: it had no protections against people using false IDs, and it allowed vote-by-mail to continue without proof of identification.   ""Vote by mail, that we know, is the greatest source of voter fraud in this state. In fact, all of the prosecutions by the attorney general — I shouldn’t say all, but a great majority of the prosecutions by the attorney general occur with respect to vote by mail,"" Anchía said in 2007.   Cain posted the clip to his Facebook and Twitter pages July 22. Roy cited it in the congressional hearing one week later.   ""Remember when TX State Rep. @RafaelAnchia admitted that vote-by-mail was ‘the greatest source of election fraud’ in Texas,"" Cain tweeted. ""Now he’s in DC pretending that election fraud is a myth.""  Anchía’s office didn’t respond to interview requests, so we turned to his Democratic colleague and ally, state Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston — who remained in Texas for medical reasons while his fellow Democrats flew to D.C. — to get a sense of what Anchía was basing his claim on.   ""Maybe he didn’t know what he thought he knew,"" Coleman said. ""He may be overstating this idea that there was a lot of mail-in ballot fraud.""  Election fraud data obtained from the Texas attorney general’s office through a request under the Texas Public Information Act affirms Anchía’s 2007 statement that mail-in ballot fraud was the greatest source of voter fraud in the state. But the data also shows that voter fraud cases are exceedingly rare, both in 2007 and in the years since.   For elections between 2004 and 2007, the attorney general’s office convicted 33 people of 163 voter fraud charges out of the tens of millions of ballots cast in the primary and general elections during those years. About 140 of those charges, or 85%, involved mail-in voter fraud.  The proportion of mail-in ballot fraud among all voter fraud offenses through 2020 has decreased since then. According to the data, 58% of the 534 charges stemming from elections since 2004 involved mail-in voter fraud.  ""If we can agree that this is the greatest source of fraud — as Anchía did, then it's reckless to expand it in ways that make it harder to detect. If we do that, we only create further distrust in elections,"" Roy told PolitiFact. ""If a store owner who says, ‘We never sell alcohol to minors’ never checks IDs, how much faith can we put in that statement?""  The cases the attorney general’s office has prosecuted are the result of ongoing crackdowns on voter fraud over the last 15 years — during the tenure of Gov. Greg Abbott as attorney general and current Attorney General Ken Paxton.  In 2005, for instance, Abbott used part of a $1.4 million federal crime fighting grant to establish a voter fraud unit within his attorney general’s office. One year later, the task force brought charges against 11 individuals. One involved a person illegally casting a ballot, the others involved people assisting seniors in casting mail-in ballots, according to the Lone Star Project.   In 2020, Paxton beefed up the voter fraud unit by dedicating more than 22,000 staff hours to voter fraud cases that year, doubling the time the office spent working on fraud cases in 2018, according to the Houston Chronicle. The result was 16 prosecutions, all involving Harris County residents who gave false addresses on their voter registration forms.  According to Ed Martin, a political strategist and former executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, the mounting resources invested in finding voter fraud over the years versus the few cases prosecuted shows Republicans’ underlying agenda.   ""The consistent context has been an unrelenting national vote suppression agenda that is based on bogus fraud claims that are not supported by facts on the ground in Texas,"" Martin said.   And to Coleman, the attorney general’s recent efforts to find voter fraud cases is an attempt to bolster former President Donald Trump’s false claim that the 2020 election was rigged against him.  ""This is all about keeping Trump voters believing that the election was stolen,"" said Coleman. ""They wouldn't have to say that there 'are more than 100 (fraudulent ballots). That's enough. People will believe it was stolen.""  Speaking during an Aug. 1 rally outside the Texas Capitol, state Sen. Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola, framed the rationale behind Republican’s voting legislation, which he authored, this way:  ""The other side, they used to say, ‘There’s no evidence of voter fraud.’ And so we showed them evidence, and then they started saying, ‘Well, there’s no evidence of widespread voter fraud.’ And our question to them has been, how much fraud is okay?"" he said.  During a congressional hearing, Roy claimed that Anchía, a Democratic Texas House member currently breaking quorum in Washington, said in 2007 that mail-in ballot fraud ""is the greatest source of voter fraud in this state."" Anchía is one of 57 Texas Democratic lawmakers breaking quorum in order to block passage of a GOP voting bill, which includes new restrictions and requirements for mail-in voting.  Roy is correct. Anchía gave those remarks while speaking in opposition to a voter ID law in 2007, making the point that lawmakers should be focusing on fraud stemming from mail-in ballots rather than voter impersonation.   Anchía’s statement is correct too. As of 2007, about 85% of voter fraud cases involved mail-in-ballot fraud. About 58% of voter fraud cases since 2005 involve mail-in ballot fraud. But the total number of prosecutions are minuscule compared to the tens of millions of votes cast in the last 15 years.   We rate Roy’s claim True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F4A400>],/factchecks/2021/aug/06/chip-roy/among-rare-cases-voter-fraud-texas-mail-ballot-fra/

Tiffany misses the point behind why prices are rising for hotels, gas and car rentals
","Since the introduction of the coronavirus vaccine, people have been spending more time outside their homes.  With that has come more travel. And if you’re a traveler, you’ve surely noticed an increase in price for things such as gas, rental cars and hotels.  U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, R-Wisconsin, certainly has. In a July 20, 2021 tweet, Tiffany attributed big jumps in the price for car rentals, gas and hotels to ""reckless spending"" by Democrats.  The tweet noted that ""car rentals"" are up 87%, gas prices are up 45.1% and hotel prices are up 16.9%.  Before we begin, an important note: Tiffany does not offer a timeframe for the period he is citing and, to be sure, ""car rentals"" is different than ""car rental costs."" We’ll assume that he means the cost of rentals and that he is citing increases since the start of Biden’s term -- but, in the end, the specific increases are not the most important part of this fact-check. The real question is one of blame. So, are Democratic bills and proposals -- many of which have not been passed or implemented yet -- fueling the rise in costs of travel?  Let’s unpack this one. When we asked Tiffany’s staff for backup, staffers pointed to several articles about the American Rescue Plan Act-- advanced by President Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress -- and the risk that the plan would boost inflation to rates the country hasn’t seen in decades.  Of course, not every economist shares that view. Inflation, of course, occurs when prices rise, decreasing your purchasing power. For example, in 1980, a movie ticket cost on average $2.89, but by 2019 an average ticket cost $9.16. So if you had saved a $10 bill from 1980, it would buy fewer movie tickets now than it did then. According to economists, inflation is generally a product of several factors, including higher government spending, higher deficits and borrowing costs. (In this case, interest rates have remained steady, according to a June 10, 2021 report from the Washington Post, meaning it’s cheap for the U.S. government to borrow money right now.) Day-to-day price changes, though, are driven by other factors, chiefly the laws of supply and demand. When demand is high and supply is low, costs go up. The same Post article notes that inflation rose by 5% between May 2020 and May 2021. That, of course, comes a year after most of the country was locked down and people were purchasing less -- and, notably, traveling much less. So, if inflation went up 5%, why have travel costs grown so much more? That’s where supply and demand come in. Rental cars The rental car industry was hit especially hard by the pandemic.  With almost no people traveling or renting cars, the top rental companies were forced to sell off about a third of their total fleet, according to a July 26, 2021 report in New York Magazine. Hertz, one of the largest, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  Once the pandemic ebbed and people began to travel again, a shortage of microchips caused car manufacturing to stall, limiting the ability of rental companies to restock their fleets.  The rising demand for rentals has forced prices higher and higher, reaching upwards of $1,000 per trip for some travelers, depending on location and duration.  The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline in the United States was $3.18 on Aug. 3, 2021, according to the AAA Gas Price map. One year earlier, it was $2.18. Before that, prices had dipped as low as $.99 in some places.  According to a June 10, 2021 fact check from USA TODAY, gas prices have been increasing since April 2020, after the pandemic forced prices down as people stayed home amid widespread closure orders aimed at controlling the coronavirus.  The data also shows prices have been rising -- for the most part -- since before Joe Biden was elected and Democrats took control of the House and Senate. That is, when Republican Donald Trump was in office. So, clearly, action by Democrats is not solely responsible for the increase, as Tiffany claims. ""Gas prices fluctuate regardless of who is in office,"" said Molly Hart, a public and government relations spokesperson for AAA, in an email. ""During the past year and a half, pump prices have primarily been driven by the pandemic’s influence on supply and demand.""  Some critics have tried to link the higher prices to cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline and other green energy policies proposed by the Biden Administration. But experts say they have not had any major impact on prices yet, though they may have an impact in the future. 
  According to a June 20, 2021 report from USA TODAY, the COVID pandemic itself -- not Democratic-backed relief packages -- are behind these increases, too.  Now that restrictions have been lifted, people are leaving their communities more often to travel. They’re heading to Disney World, the beach or mountains more often, meaning there’s more demand for hotel rooms or other short-term rentals.  ""The price increase has been driven by a surge in demand,"" the USA TODAY report said. For instance, a quarterly AAA survey of Wisconsin residents conducted in June 2021 found that 80% of respondents said they felt more comfortable traveling than they did three months earlier.  Simply put, said Kevin Pahr, a professor of finance at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, inflation did occur for many travel-related expenses, but it wasn’t because of spending this year by the government.  ""The recent spike in inflation can be primarily attributable to three main factors (rather than any stimulus plan),"" Pahr said. ""The realization of pent-up demand, particularly in the travel, leisure, and hospitality industries, as the U.S. economy reopened and concerns over COVID-19 were mitigated, energy prices and supply chain disruptions.""   Tiffany claimed that spending by Democrats is driving major jumps in car rentals, gas prices and hotel prices this summer. While inflation has gone up about 5% between May 2020 and May 2021, that doesn’t account for the much larger spikes in the price of rental cars, gas and hotels, which are driven more by supply and demand issues, rather than a general growth in costs.  During the pandemic, rental car companies sold off some of their cars to help make ends meet. Oil production dropped. And hotels stood mostly empty.  But now demand is soaring, driving prices up.  For a claim that is partially accurate but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.   ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A61280>],/factchecks/2021/aug/06/tom-tiffany/tiffany-misses-point-behind-why-prices-are-rising-/

Be careful, getting fired over a vaccine mandate may cost you unemployment aid
","Some people opposed to the COVID-19 vaccines say they have a workaround for dealing with businesses that require employees to get the shots. ""If your employer is mandating any pokes, do not quit,"" said one user in an Aug. 4 Facebook post. ""Make them fire you. That way you get unemployment benefits and can pursue legal action."" This social media career advice is flawed, labor law experts told PolitiFact. The post, shared thousands of times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  ""This post is incorrect,"" said Charlotte Garden, an associate professor at Seattle University School of Law. ""Workers who are fired because they refuse a vaccine are unlikely to be eligible."" State guidelines for determining eligibility do vary, and workers’ applications may be handled case by case. But overall, the message from people trained in this kind of law was don’t count on it. ""In the absence of some special state legislation protecting workers from being discharged for refusing to be vaccinated, they can be discharged for such refusal without being eligible for unemployment compensation,"" said Michael Harper, a law professor at Boston University. Unemployment payments are provided to Americans who wind up out of a job through no fault of their own, such as when a business closes or downsizes.  Each state sets its own guidelines for determining eligibility, including for fired workers. But in many states, a person who was let go for misconduct can be denied benefits. In Alabama, for example, a state with one of the lowest vaccination rates, a state handbook says unemployment payments can be delayed or disqualified for workers fired ""for misconduct in connection with the work,"" which can include ""failure to obey an employer’s work rules and policies,"" ""endangering the safety of others"" and ""disregarding orders or instructions."" Experts agreed that violating a policy requiring vaccinations against COVID-19 would likely disqualify a fired employee from getting benefits, unless the worker was exempted for medical or religious reasons covered by federal law. ""What counts as misconduct is defined differently in different states, and it is a relatively high bar in some places,"" Garden said. ""Still, I think most unemployment agencies and courts would agree that willfully violating a workplace safety rule — including a vaccination requirement — is sufficient misconduct to make a worker ineligible for unemployment insurance."" Garden said she is not aware of any state that awards unemployment benefits to workers fired for significant misconduct. According to a recent report from WUSA9, a TV station in Washington, D.C., workers who get terminated for rejecting company vaccination policies would likely be denied unemployment benefits under the laws in Washington, Virginia and Maryland. TV stations in North Carolina and Michigan reported that workers there could expect the same. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel advised in July that employers can mandate vaccines as a ""condition of employment."" The legal opinion clarified that U.S. law ""does not prohibit public or private entities from imposing vaccination requirements for a vaccine that is subject to an emergency use authorization"" — an argument sometimes pushed by people opposed to vaccines. A federal judge in June threw out one lawsuit filed by employees at a Houston hospital system over a vaccine requirement. ""Employers generally have wide discretion to require safety measures,"" said Catherine Fisk, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law. In some states like California, the law itself has vaccine requirements for certain workers, such as those in health care. Some workers represented by a union and covered by a collective bargaining agreement might have more leverage, said Harper, the Boston University law professor. Even then, the union would have considerable power to decide how to handle a worker grievance over such a firing. ""Some unions are negotiating over this,"" Fisk said. After Tyson Foods, a food corporation, announced a vaccine mandate recently, for example, a union leader said in a statement that the union will be meeting with the company to discuss the mandate and ""ensure that the rights of these workers are protected."" The Facebook post is also inaccurate as it pertains to people who quit their jobs, Garden said, since there are some specific scenarios in which a person could quit and be entitled to benefits. This could be the case if a worker quit because they were medically exempt from a company’s vaccine mandate but were not provided with a reasonable accommodation, Garden said. Overall, people who rely on the post and follow its guidance ""are going to receive a very unpleasant surprise when they are denied unemployment benefits,"" Garden said. A Facebook post said, ""If your employer is mandating any pokes, do not quit. Make them fire you. That way you get unemployment benefits and can pursue legal action."" Unemployment benefits are not guaranteed to people who get fired for refusing to comply with a company’s vaccine requirements. On the contrary, legal experts said that while state guidelines vary, it’s more likely that a worker in that situation would be denied such benefits for violating company policy.

A pro-capitalism quote misattributed to Abraham Lincoln resurfaces
","Two years and 11 days ago, a social media post brought forth upon Facebook another quote falsely attributed to Abraham Lincoln. The July 25, 2019, post pairs an image of Lincoln with a quote suggesting that the Great Emancipator was also a devout capitalist. It says: ""You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift. You cannot lift the wage earner up by pulling the wage payer down. You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred. You cannot build character and courage by taking away people’s initiative and independence.

""Lincoln never said such one-sided things about capital or labor,"" said James Cornelius, editor for the Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association. The words are from the Rev. William J.H. Boetcker, an ex-clergyman and conservative public speaker from Pennsylvania. They’re published in his 1916 pamphlet ""Inside Maxims,"" better known as ""Ten Cannots."" (The quote that appears on Facebook and elsewhere excludes a few of the cannots.) The quote has been misattributed to Lincoln several times before. In 1988, then Vice President George H.W. Bush did so in a speech before the Bucks County, Pa., Chamber of Commerce, and former President Ronald Reagan made the error in his speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention. The likely reason for the mixup: In 1942, the Committee for Constitutional Government, a right-wing organization, published a leaflet called ""Lincoln on Limitation."" On the front, the leaflet contained real quotes from Lincoln, but on the back, it contained the quote from Boetcker. Careless readers assumed the quote was linked to Lincoln.  Cornelius said it was common for people to use Lincoln’s name ""to bring more attention to themselves.""  ""I do not know if Boetcker himself, or conceivably some newspaper editor, put these into (Lincoln’s) mouth,"" Cornelius said, ""but they have circulated as ‘real’ for 100 years now, with no sign of disappearing.""  We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097051740>],/factchecks/2021/aug/05/facebook-posts/pro-capitalism-quote-misattributed-abraham-lincoln/

Contrary to Good, masks have been shown to limit COVID spread
","U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., takes a dim view of mask mandates. ""Wearing masks has not been demonstrated to make a significant impact in preventing the spread of COVID, and no one should be forced to wear a mask,"" he wrote in a July 26 Facebook post. We fact-checked Good’s statement and found strong evidence that masks prevent coronavirus spread, although there is debate over the effectiveness of each type of mask. Let’s take a look. Good represents Virginia’s 5th Congressional District stretching from Southside Virginia through Charlotteville and up to Front Royal.  We asked Good’s office to back up his claim. Although his statement broadly refers to masks, much of the information we received focused on cloth masks. His office sent interviews with two epidemiologists who question the effectiveness of cloth masks in stopping COVID spread. One is Michael Osterholm, a former adviser to President Joe Biden who heads the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ""When you look at cloth coverings … they only have a limited impact in reducing the amount of virus you inhale and exhale,"" Olsterholm said in an Aug. 3, 2021, interview on CNN. ""The bottom line is that by telling people that just putting a cloth mask on is going to protect you is simply not true,"" he added. Similar remarks by Olsterholm have caused a stir for several months. He clarified his comments in a July 23 post. ""I support the wearing of cloth face coverings (masks) by the general public,"" he wrote, adding that he sometimes wears such masks himself.  Olsterholm asked people to stop using him ""as grounds to not wear masks."" He said masks should be supplemented by social distancing and vaccinations. Olsterholm also called for a continuous effort to improve face coverings and spoke highly of N95 masks that have largely been reserved for medical personnel. Good’s office also sent us testimony of virologist Li-Meng Yan before the House Freedom Caucus, to which the congressman belongs, on Aug. 3, 2021. Yan is the author of a controversial report alleging COVID was made in a Chinese government laboratory. Yan also questioned the efficacy of cloth masks and said mask mandates ""were not based on scientific evidence; it’s just based on scientists’ claims."" She said ""masks can’t stop the flow of the virus"" because droplets can still fall on uncovered parts of the face that people touch, such as around the eyes. But Yan added that surgical and N95 masks ""can reduce some percentage of COVID-19 spreading a short distance."" She’s also tweeted that masks ""are necessary when it is crowded and (there is a) lack of social distancing."" She recommended surgical masks for such occasions. Good’s office also sent an article about an Indian study finding masks are beneficial that was rejected in peer review. And we received research published in February 2021 by The Lancet, a peer-reviewed medical journal, that studied the spread of COVID from 314 victims to close contacts in Catalonia, Spain. ""We did not find any evidence of decreased risk of transmission in individuals who reported mask use,"" the study concluded. Authors of the Catalonia study acknowledged their finding ""collides with evidence found elsewhere"" and were not sure why. They noted that their study had ""several limitations."" Indeed, there is a large body of research that concludes masks do limit COVID spread that has been published by leading health institutes and medical journals. Here’s a sampling: In March 2020, the CDC investigated an outbreak of largely symptomatic COVID cases aboard the crowded aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt. In a sample of 382 service members, those who reported wearing face masks had a 56% infection rate compared to an 81% rate among those who did not wear them. A study was conducted in Beijing of 335 people from 124 families in which there was at least one confirmed COVID case in March 2020. Researchers found families that reported wearing masks before the first infection lowered their risk of secondary infections by 79%. A month-long study in Thailand focused on 839 originally uninfected close contacts of 211 people who had asymptomatic COVID. Those who wore masks all the time when in contact with the infected person had a 77% lower risk of infection than those who did not. In mid 2020, Boston researchers conducted an online survey, asking people if they wore masks in grocery stores and in friends’ homes. They got 378,207 responses and concluded that a 10% increase in mask wearing more than tripled the odds of stopping community spread of COVID. In March 2020, Massachusetts’ largest healthcare system — Mass General Brigham — implemented a policy of universal mask wearing and systematic COVID testing for its employees. Positive test results for health care workers went down 22% the next month. In Germany, researchers found new daily COVID infections dropped by 45% in regions of their country 20 days after masks were mandated in spring 2020. In Springfield, Mo., 139 clients were exposed to two hairstylists with symptomatic COVID in spring 2020. With both the stylists and the clients wearing face masks, no secondary cases were reported. Sixty-seven of the clients were tested for COVID, and all of their results were negative Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly implemented an executive order on July 3, 2020, that mandated mask wearing in public spaces, but allowed counties to opt out. Six weeks later, COVID infections were down 6% in the 24 counties that enforced the mandate and up 100% in the 81 counties that didn’t. The National Institutes of Health posted a study of the effects of mask mandates in 15 states and the District of Columbia. It found that three weeks after the mandates began, COVID infections were dropping by 2% a day. Researchers credited the mandate with averting more than 200,000 COVID cases over two months. Researchers found that mask mandates in Ontario led to a ""25% or larger weekly reduction in new COVID-19 cases"" during summer 2020. Good says, ""Wearing masks has not been demonstrated to make a significant impact in preventing the spread of COVID."" The two experts he cites don’t say that. They express concerns about cloth masks but, even so, one of them says he sometimes wears them. Both experts say other types of masks do prevent COVID spread. Good points to outlier studies to back his claim. In one, a Catalonian sample group received no benefit from wearing masks. The other study, from India, found benefits from masks but was rejected in peer review. What Good ignores is a wide body of research from around the world that found mask wearing to noticeably reduce infection rates. We rate Good’s claim False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A311680>],/factchecks/2021/aug/05/bob-good/contrary-good-masks-have-been-shown-limit-covid-sp/

","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that all air passengers from abroad, including people who are fully vaccinated, are required to show a negative COVID-19 test result from no more than three days before they travel, or documentation that they recovered from COVID-19 within the previous three months, before they can board a flight to the United States.  A screenshot of this information from the CDC’s website is being shared on social media and some users are claiming that the agency only recently — and secretly — updated its international travel recommendations to include vaccinated travelers in this rule.  Text above the screenshot says that it doesn’t matter if you’ve had the vaccine, ""you STILL need a negative test to travel.""  ""So the CDC just snuck that in this week,"" one account wrote sharing the screenshot on Instagram on May 15.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The CDC page on international travel recommendations during the pandemic was updated on May 19, but requiring vaccinated passengers to get a COVID-19 test isn’t new. The CDC announced these rules affecting all air passengers nearly four months earlier on Jan. 12, 2021. Here’s what the page with international travel recommendations said on May 27 (emphasis theirs):  ""Before you arrive in the United States all air passengers coming to the United States, including U.S. citizens and fully vaccinated people, are required to have a negative COVID-19 test result no more than 3 days before travel or documentation of recovery from COVID-19 in the past 3 months before they board a flight to the United State."" Reviewing archived versions of the web page, we found that language has appeared on the site since at least April 2, the first date for which there are archived versions of the page. But news reports show that this guidance has been around for even longer. On March 8, ABC News and USA Today reported that the CDC had provided new recommendations for fully vaccinated Americans that day but it didn’t update or relax travel measures and advised against traveling at all. ABC then reported that ""if people plan to travel they should get vaccinated if possible, get tested before and after the trip, wear a well fitting mask, and maintain distance from others when possible, the guidance says.""  We rate the claim that the CDC in May quietly changed its recommendations for fully vaccinated travelers False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A311D00>],/factchecks/2021/may/27/viral-image/fully-vaccinated-rules-havent-changed-internationa/

Yes, prices are higher under Biden, but recovery from the pandemic is key reason
","An image widely shared on Facebook blames President Joe Biden for how much more five commodities cost in April 2021 versus a year earlier.  But it ignores the fact that in April 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic all but shut down the economy and depressed prices across the board. ""How much more does it cost to live in Joe Biden’s America?"" is the headline of the image. Then the image lists what it says are the prices in April 2020 vs April 2021, Biden’s third month as president, attributing the figures to Markets Insider: 1,000 feet of lumber board: $304 to $1,500 Gallon of gas: $1.95 to $3.05 Ton of wheat: $183 to $251 Ton of coal: $39 to $80 Bushel of corn: $3.43 to $6.86 One Facebook user who shared the image added this in a post: ""No explanation needed… ruining America 2.0…."" The price increases claimed are roughly accurate. Lumber: In a previous article, we found that depending on the type, the cost of plywood had risen dramatically. In the South, for example, the price of a 23/32-inch panel was $455 per thousand square feet in the first week of April 2020 and $1,500 a year later. Similarly, Markets Insider shows lumber overall was roughly five times more expensive in April 2021 than a year earlier. Gasoline: Weekly figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show the price was as low as $1.87 in April 2020 and as high as $2.96 in April 2021. Wheat: Weekly figures from Markets Insider show a ton of wheat cost as little as $194.75 in April 2020 and as much as $257.75 in April 2021. Coal: Figures from Markets Insider show the price was $39 per ton at the end of April 2020 and $71.90 a year later. Corn: Weekly Markets Insider figures show corn as low as $3.19 per bushel in April 2020 and as high as $7.02 in April 2021. We examined the threat of inflation in an article in mid-May. Economists said that most of the current rise in consumer prices stems from supply chains having to adjust quickly to greater economic activity after increased vaccination has eased the pandemic. Recent price trends for some basic commodities illustrate the ripple effect of the widespread business shutdowns that hit just a little over a year ago, and the resurgence of demand as vaccinations and declining COVID-19 case numbers promise a return to normal business activity. For example, in the case of gasoline, experts said, tight supplies drove prices up from January, when Biden took office, to April (before a May hacker attack shut down a key pipeline). In general, a president has limited control over the weekly and monthly shifts in gasoline prices. And for plywood, mills that shut down or reduced production during the throes of the pandemic in 2020 still haven’t caught up to increased demand. All in all, the peculiar transition to a post-pandemic economy has produced mismatches in supply and demand that are now driving the sharpest inflation. Economists expect these price increases to reverse once supply chains iron out delays and shortages.  The only Biden policy that has affected prices is the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill he signed March 11, said Abdur Chowdhury, an emeritus economics professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee. ""Consumers have ample cash in hand. As the economy reopens, consumer spending on leisure, travel, entertainment and other service-related activities will increase,"" he said. Blaming Biden for the inflation ""seems an exaggeration at best,"" said Jeffrey Miron, a senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University and  director of economics studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""It likely reflects recovery from the recession/pandemic, concerns about monetary policy being too accommodating, as well as concerns that fiscal stimuli, including several adopted pre-Biden, are increasing aggregate demand and pushing up prices."" An image widely shared on Facebook claimed that lumber, gas, wheat, coal and corn cost more ""in Joe Biden's America."" The specific price increases claimed are roughly accurate, but they compared April 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic had all but shut down the economy and driven down prices, with April 2021, as the nation’s recovery from the pandemic was in swing.  Economists say that post-pandemic mismatches in supply and demand are to blame for higher prices in April 2021. While presidents often get blamed for inflation, in this case the sharp contrast in prices from a year earlier is due mainly to the economy having hit a low in April 2020.

No, Virginia did not hold first Republican convention after Civil War
","Winsome Sears, the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, says she wants to convince African-Americans to return ""to our roots"" in the Republican Party. ""The very first Republican convention after the Civil War was held in Virginia in a Black church,"" she said during a May 13 interview on Fox News. There was a picture of Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, on the bookcase behind her. Her historical claim was new to us and we fact-checked it. Sears is the first Black woman to be nominated by either party for statewide office in Virginia. She’s a Jamaican immigrant, small business owner and former Marine who served one term in the House of Delegates from 2002-2004. She won the nod for lieutenant governor at the state Republican convention held on May 8. Democrats will choose  their nominees for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in a June 8 primary. We asked Sears’ campaign twice for the source of her claim that the first GOP convention after the Civil War was held in a Black church in Virginia, but did not hear back.  We found several references and old newspaper stories about a ""Mass Convention of the Union Republican Party of Virginia"" that met at the First African Baptist Church in Richmond on April 17, 1867. After the Civil War, many Northerners, Blacks and Southern reformers were unhappy with the Reconstruction policies of President Andrew Johnson. Other than enforcing the abolition of slavery, Johnson essentially gave the white Southern establishment free reign to run their states.  Radical Republicans from the North won firm control of Congress in 1866. Early the next year, Congress passed and overrode Johnson’s veto of the Reconstruction Acts of 1867 that divided the South into five military districts. To be readmitted to the Union, each state was required to hold a convention to draft a new constitution ratifying the 14th Amendment, which gave voting rights to all men. The Union Republican Party held its statewide meeting in Richmond in April 1867 to prepare for Virginia’s constitutional convention, which convened nearly eight months later. Of the 210 delegates who attended the meeting, 160 were Black, according to ""Virginia: The New Dominion,"" an authoritative history of the state published in 1971.  The Republicans elected a statewide leadership committee and passed a platform calling for: Compliance with the federal Reconstruction Acts;  Publicly-funded schools with equal (albeit segregated) education; Equal legal protections; Fairer tax and lending laws, and Internal improvements. The Daily Dispatch newspaper in Richmond covered the convention with respect and ridicule, occasionally crediting Black delegates for making intelligent arguments, but more often belittling their statements and quoting them in dialect. The delegates stated in a resolution that their meeting was the ""first time in the history of Virginia"" that the Union Republicans assembled as a convention to consider the Reconstruction Act. But was it the very first Republican convention held anywhere after the Civil War, as Sears says? The answer is no.  North Carolina Republicans held a state convention in Raleigh on March 27, 1867 - three weeks before their Virginia brethren. ""The state became the first in the South to hold a Republican convention,"" according to an April 2011 article in the North Carolina Historical Review. The convention officially established the North Carolina Republican Party and was attended by 148 delegates, about half of them Black, according to the book ""Blacks, Carpetbaggers and Scalawags,"" by historians Richard L. Hume and Jerry B. Gough of Washington State University. In the North, Ohio Republicans held a state convention in June 1865 - about two months after the war ended - to nominate a candidate for governor. In 1866, there were at least four statewide Republican conventions - held in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Maine and Rhode Island. Our ruling Sears said, ""The very first Republican convention after the Civil War was held in Virginia in a Black church."" The Union Republican Party of Virginia held a state convention at the First African Baptist Church in Richmond on April 17, 1867. Records show Republicans in at least six states - one in the South and five in the North - held post-Civil War conventions before Virginia. So, we rate Sears’ statement False. Editor’s Note, June 17, 2021: As noted in this fact check, Sears’ campaign did not respond to two requests we made for the source of her claim that the first GOP convention after the Civil War was held in a Black church in Virginia. After the fact check was published, Sears’ campaign told us her claim was based on an historical marker outside the First African Baptist Church in Richmond that says, ""In 1865, the site hosted the first Republican State Convention held in Virginia.""  We contacted Virginia’s Department of Historic Resources, which researches and posts historical markers and, after investigation, it told us the sign is incorrect. The church hosted Virginia’s first post-Civil War Republican convention in April 1867, as we reported. ""We may need to consider a revision to the marker,"" Randall Jones, public information director for the department, said. By April 1867, at least six other states had held Republican conventions since the war’s end. That continues to undercut Sears’s unqualified statement that the church held the first post-war convention, period. So, our False rating on Sears’ claim remains intact.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097286C00>],/factchecks/2021/may/27/winsome-sears/no-virginia-did-not-hold-first-republican-conventi/

Police misconduct settlements can shift city budgets
","On the anniversary of the murder of George Floyd, two federal lawmakers want to make Americans more aware of not only the human toll of police misconduct, but the financial cost too. Virginia Democrats Sen. Tim Kaine and Rep. Don Beyer wrote in a CNBC op-ed that every year, taxpayers pay millions of dollars to settle lawsuits against the police. While a handful of large settlements draw headlines, such as the $27 million in Minneapolis for the death of Floyd, the majority don’t. And Kaine and Beyer said those payments have an impact on everyone. ""The money taxpayers spend on police misconduct has the potential to defund other municipal services,"" they wrote May 24. ""In 2017, New Haven, Conn., had to issue bonds for a bridge after using funds for that bridge to pay for a police misconduct settlement."" Kaine and Beyer have companion bills that would require federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to report yearly on the amount they spend on judgements and settlements. The idea is that the disclosures would focus more attention on the cost of misconduct and motivate efforts to fight it. We wondered about the New Haven example. Was money for a bridge diverted to settle a lawsuit against the police? Yes, it was, although the shift in money was temporary. In 2017, the New Haven board of alders voted to transfer $8.4 million from a number of city departments to meet an impending payment deadline for the legal settlement. Altogether, they drew from over 20 line items in the city budget, but three-fourths of the total — $6.35 million — came from money slated for the city’s Grand Avenue Bridge. The next year, the board of alders backfilled the $8.4 million with additional borrowing through its bond program.  City officials said they were able to absorb the impact on city services. The lawsuit itself stemmed from a 1990 double-murder case. One of the men convicted, Scott Lewis, served nearly two decades in prison before winning his release in 2014, with all charges dropped. Lewis had been found guilty based on testimony orchestrated by a New Haven police detective. The detective promised leniency to another criminal if he testified against Lewis and his alleged accomplice.  In 2013, a judge found that the detective had withheld essential evidence from Lewis’ defense attorneys. In 2015, the same judge also ruled that the New Haven Police chief had consciously decided not to discipline the detective ""despite numerous indications of serious misconduct."" Lewis successfully sued New Haven, and when the city’s last appeal failed, it settled in 2017. Kaine and Beyer said that cities and counties pay millions of dollars each year in penalties and settlements, and research backs that up. A joint reporting project from FiveThirtyEight and the Marshall Project gathered records from over 30 cities, in most cases going back about a decade. They found that on average, New York City spent over $170 million a year to settle lawsuits against the police. Milwaukee paid an average of about $4 million a year. Indianapolis spent $1.3 million. The investigative effort required to pull those details together speaks to a key problem: Few cities track or publish these numbers. ""The public and the police don’t have this information,"" said University of California, Los Angeles law professor Joanna Schwartz. ""These are taxpayers’ dollars, and they should know how their money is spent. And right now they don't."" This, Schwartz said, defeats a key purpose of misconduct lawsuits — deterring future misconduct. ""The police chief could be looking at the cost of chokeholds, and decide that chokeholds are too expensive to keep using,"" Schwartz said. ""But if the chief doesn’t have this info, it can’t shape behavior."" Seeing the totals in one place, backers argue, might also increase public pressure for change. Taxpayers notice large settlements, such as Louisville’s $12 million to the family of Breonna Taylor or Cleveland’s $6 million to the family of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, but in many jurisdictions, the amounts are much lower. It’s only when someone tallies them up that the full burden becomes clear. Schwartz cautions, however, that even looking at the full totals might not be enough to spur policy changes. They tend to amount to much less than 1% of a city or county’s annual budget.  And her research in 2016 found that the costs of penalties or settlements rarely land on the police departments that drew the legal action. In the handful of places where the funds came out of a department’s budget, there was some greater awareness, but Schwartz found even that was muted. City and county budget processes ended up insulating law enforcement officials from the consequences of their misconduct. Kaine said police settlements can defund city services, as when ""New Haven, Conn, had to issue bonds for a bridge after using funds for that bridge to pay for a police misconduct settlement.""  In 2017, the city drew a total of $8.4 million from a number of city programs, including $6.35 from a bridge project, to settle a lawsuit against the police. It backfilled the $8.4 million the next year by selling new bonds.  We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976B1F00>],/factchecks/2021/may/27/tim-kaine/police-misconduct-settlements-can-shift-city-budge/

Claim that Georgia decertified the election is a Pants on Fire falsehood
","Georgia’s Republican secretary of state certified the presidential election results in November showing that Joe Biden won the state. But six months later, a state judge’s order authorizing an inspection of absentee ballots has inspired a fresh round of falsehoods about the Georgia election. ""Boom! Georgia 1st to decertify election,"" stated a May 25 Facebook post. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The Facebook post is wrong: Georgia officials have not decertified the election. A few days before the Facebook post, Henry County Superior Court Judge Brian Amero issued an order that allows a group of plaintiffs, led by a self-proclaimed election watchdog, to inspect and scan the general election absentee ballots cast in Democratic-leaning Fulton County. Precisely what this will entail isn’t yet known. Amero indicated he will issue a subsequent order about protocols. Plaintiffs have alleged improper counting of ballots and the existence of ""counterfeit"" ballots. Amero’s ruling has been embraced by Republicans who have sided with former President Donald Trump’s falsehoods about the election.  One of the plaintiffs, Garland Favorito, is a longtime critic of Georgia’s election infrastructure. Favorito has promoted affidavits signed by poll workers or observers in which they leap to conclusions about the integrity of absentee ballots, suggesting they weren’t properly marked or weren’t printed on normal paper.  ""The purpose of the inspection is to find the truth about the Fulton mail-in ballots so that all Georgians will have the assurance of elections transparency,"" Favorito told PolitiFact. The Facebook post links to a video by Christian Patriot News, a conservative outlet. The speaker in the video predicts ""Judge Amero will demand that Gov. Kemp will call a special session to decertify these election results. Boom!""  But none of that has happened. Amero’s two-paragraph order did not call for any sort of decertification, scrapping of results, or special legislative session. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger certified the results of the presidential election in November following an audit that reaffirmed Biden’s victory. Congress counted the electoral votes from the states including Georgia on Jan. 6. Raffensperger and Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, have repeatedly said they found no evidence of systematic voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Lawsuits filed on behalf of former President Donald Trump and his allies seeking to decertify the election results were rejected by the courts. Raffensperger’s office indicated that he hasn’t sought to decertify the election, and there is no such legal process.  ""There is no mechanism under Georgia law to decertify an election,"" said Bryan P. Tyson, a Georgia election lawyer who has represented both Democrats and Republicans, including Raffensperger. ""If they find problems in an election after it was certified, the only remedy to the election contest is a judge hears evidence and orders a new election if there were enough problems that it could have changed the results. It is rare."" A Facebook post said Georgia decertified its election results. That didn’t happen. A judge in Georgia permitted plaintiffs in an election lawsuit to inspect absentee ballots cast in Fulton County, but didn’t order a new election. And there is no evidence that state officials have decertified the election results.  Boom!

Photo shows a gold mine, not lithium mine for hybrid cars
","A self-proclaimed ""public service announcement"" widely shared on Facebook tries to portray the manufacturing of hybrid vehicles as bad for the environment — but the key photo it uses is of a gold mine. One photo appears to show a pipeline cutting a clean and narrow path through a forest; the other shows an expansive pit that looks like it’s been stripped by a machine.  ""Keystone Pipeline vs. Lithium Mine for Hybrid Cars.

The Trump administration approved construction of an 875-mile extension of the Keystone line — Keystone XL — but President Joe Biden reversed the approval in January with an executive order, on the grounds that it is harmful to the environment. The bottom photo does not show a mine to extract lithium, an element used to make batteries. It’s a gold mine. A Google search and a TinEye reverse-image search shows the image is  widely available as a Getty Images stock photo, depicting a gold mine in Kalgoorlie, Australia. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen attempts on Facebook to compare the environmental effects of a pipeline against hybrid or electric vehicles. In March, we rated a similar post False because the ""lithium mine"" it alleged to be showing was actually a copper and cobalt mine. Lithium-ion batteries are used for most plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and all-electric vehicles, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Most of their components can be recycled, ""but the cost of material recovery remains a challenge for the industry,"" the department says. The world’s lithium is either mined in Australia or from salt flats in the Andean regions of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. The operations use large amounts of groundwater. The water required means that manufacturing electric vehicles is about 50% more water intensive than traditional internal combustion engines, the New York Times reported. Most lithium is extracted from salty liquid brines that are far beneath the Earth’s surface, according to the Minerals Education Coalition — not open-pit mines like the copper one shown in the photos. That’s not to say lithium isn’t ever extracted from open-pit mines, it’s just less common and often involves smaller pits. The key photo in this comparison is of a gold mine, not a lithium mine, so we rate the post False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A40DD80>],/factchecks/2021/may/26/facebook-posts/photo-shows-gold-mine-not-lithium-mine-hybrid-cars/

There’s no proof that COVID-19 vaccine has injured or killed more than 900 children
","Two weeks after Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine was cleared for use in adolescents, newly reported clinical trial results show Moderna’s vaccine is also highly effective for 12- to 17-year-olds, a hopeful sign for parents who are eager to get their kids vaccinated before school starts in the fall. But an Instagram post  suggests that parents ought to be worried about the safety of the vaccines in children. The post includes a graphic that reads, ""The latest CDC data show reports of adverse events from COVID vaccines surpass 220,000, including 943 among 12-17 year olds.""  The user who posted the image wrote in the caption, ""I can’t help but to focus on the fact that 943 innocent kids whose parents believed that they were doing the right thing to protect their children — thanks to the propaganda packaged as science — are now injured or dead."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So far, there’s no hard proof of anyone in the U.S. — adults or children — having died as a result of getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Three people have died from a rare blood clotting issue that health officials have said could be linked to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which hasn't been approved for children. This graphic attributes adverse-event data to the CDC, apparently referring to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, a public data collection tool run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.  The agencies and other medical researchers use the system to monitor adverse events — or possible side effects — following a vaccine that may warrant further study. For example, the CDC is currently investigating 18 cases of heart inflammation in teens and young adults, out of 164 million people who have received at least one dose of the vaccine. VAERS is designed so that any person can report an adverse event, and anyone can scour the reports.  But VAERS accepts reports without verifying whether a vaccine actually caused that incident. That makes VAERS a dangerous breeding ground for misinformation that spreads quickly on social media and elsewhere. For more than 30 years, VAERS data has been misused to justify broad conclusions that vaccines are harmful.  The agencies that run VAERS warn that its reports cannot be used on their own to show whether a vaccine caused certain adverse events. So the events cited in the Instagram post are not evidence that anyone died or was injured because of the vaccine. We took a look at the numbers given in the claim, and checked them against what’s in VAERS.  As of the last weekly update on May 21, VAERS shows 227,612 total reported events for all age groups for the COVID-19 vaccines.  We then ran a narrower search for the 6-to-17 age group, which would include the 12- to 17-year-olds now eligible for vaccination. VAERS turned up 2,207 reported events, not 943.  But that number does not represent the number of people who died or were injured, as the Instagram post claims. It is just the number of reports entered into the database. Under the symptoms listed in those event reports, for example, ""No Adverse Event"" occurs 400 times. Many of the reports detail people experiencing the known side effects of the vaccine: headache, soreness, fever and fatigue, which are temporary and treatable with recommended over-the-counter medication.  A search that included just serious adverse events — a category that includes death, life-threatening events, and events that involve hospitalization — turned up 46 reports of events for the 6-to-17 age group. Three reported events cited a death. Each of these reports requires investigation and doesn’t signify a confirmed event related to the vaccine. So the numbers in the claim don’t align with what’s in VAERS. But more than that, VAERS reports don’t indicate whether any deaths or injuries are caused by the vaccines. Researchers would need more studies and data to determine that. An Instagram post claims that 943 children and teens have been injured or killed because of the COVID-19 vaccine. The post cites data from the government’s VAERS tool to back up this claim. For the 6-to-17 age group, a search of the VAERS tool turns up 46 reports of serious adverse events after a COVID-19 vaccination. But the agencies that maintain VAERS warn that the reports should not be used to draw conclusions about whether a vaccine causes a particular adverse event. There is no hard proof so far of anyone in the U.S. having died as a result of getting a COVID-19 vaccine. We rate this post False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A40D200>],/factchecks/2021/may/26/instagram-posts/theres-no-proof-covid-19-vaccine-has-injured-or-ki/

","The police chief in the city of La Vista, Neb., has blasted what he called ""disgusting"" rumors about the case of Ryan Larsen, an 11-year-old with autism who police say went missing on May 17.  ""There has been some chatter on social media from some keyboard warriors in basements talking about ‘We have an arrest, we found Ryan,’ that is absolutely false,"" La Vista Police Chief Bob Lausten is quoted as saying in a May 25 news report by KETV, a local ABC News affiliate.  And yet a picture of a group text conversation discussing the case continues to be shared widely online.  ""The mom confessed,"" reads one of the texts in the picture. ""She has failed a polygraph. They are having trouble getting him out because of the vegetation in the lake. She overdosed him and thru him in. They are waiting to release the info to the public until body is retrieved."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to La Vista police about the post and Lausten echoed what he told local reporters.

""THESE ARE FALSE,"" the department said on May 23.  Lausten told local news reporters the next day that authorities continue to search for the boy and that they’re focused on an area near a lake where multiple K9 dogs alerted to something.  Lausten said that police haven’t ruled out foul play but he described Larsen’s family — including the boy’s mother — as ""extremely upset.""  ""The mother, the other sisters, were just destroyed,"" the police chief said.

Social media post exaggerates economic statistics
","A recent Facebook post seeks to convince readers that the United States has fallen apart since President Joe Biden took office.  The post, featuring Bugs Bunny wearing a tuxedo, says, ""Gas prices highest in a decade. Worst jobs report in 2 decades. Highest inflation in 3 decades. Highest increase in illegal immigration in 4 decades. Y’all killed it with your emotional voting skills."" The post combines bits of accuracy with misdirection, neglecting to mention market forces beyond a president’s control. Here’s a look at each of the four claims. This claim is exaggerated. In late May, the average gallon of unleaded gas cost $3.11. For almost four years in the last decade — between 2011 and 2014 — gasoline prices were higher than they are now. Still, the current cost is the highest level since October 2014.    That’s not the highest in a decade, as the post says, but it’s the highest in a fairly long period — six and a half years.  As we’ve reported, gas prices have been steadily rising since they bottomed out at $1.87 in late April 2020. They’ve risen by about two-thirds in more than a year — but the upswing took place over both the Trump and Biden administrations. In general, a president has limited control over the weekly and monthly shifts in gasoline prices. On a short-time horizon, experts say, gas prices depend mostly on global supply and demand.  On the supply side, the OPEC oil cartel and Russia have made voluntary production cuts, which has the effect of raising prices, said Mark Finley, a fellow at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University. But the biggest factor in the recent price spike has been the slow but steady economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. When the pandemic began in the first quarter of 2020, the price of oil fell off a cliff. That reflected a plunge in demand: The pandemic shut down some major industries for weeks, and sharply curbed the ability of people to travel (in airplanes) and commute to jobs (in cars). Crude oil prices closely track the price at the pump. What the pandemic took away, however, the recovery has begun to put back. ""The coronavirus numbers in every state are moving in the right direction,"" De Haan said. ""We’re now seeing the highest demand since the pandemic started. And now that demand is up, and oil production is not, that has pushed oil prices up."" This is far off-base. The most recent monthly jobs report for April, showing a gain of 266,000 jobs, was considered a disappointment, since the receding pandemic was presumed to be capable of higher job-growth potential. The gain fell well short of what economists had expected. But disappointment over statistical projections does not mean that a gain of 266,000 jobs is the ""worst jobs report in 2 decades."" One need look no further than the loss of more than 20 million jobs recorded exactly a year earlier, when sudden business closures due to the pandemic produced a historically rapid fall-off in employment.   Even disregarding the unique economic conditions of April 2020, however, the gain of 266,000 jobs in April 2021 was nowhere close to the worst performance in two decades. There were gains of only five digits in 10 months during that period, for instance. In fact, prior to the pandemic, Trump saw increases this large only three times.   As with gas prices, presidents are not all-powerful in job creation or reduction. Economic developments beyond their direct control usually have a bigger impact than specific policies. Inflation is spiking, but this claim is exaggerated, too. On May 12, the government announced that the consumer price index was 4.2% higher in April 2021 than a year earlier. That’s the fastest increase since September 2008, nearly 13 years ago — not 30 years ago, as the claim suggests.   It’s also important to put this inflation spike in context. For starters, it’s nowhere near a record: Inflation peaked at 13.5% in 1980.  Economists say the current spike is largely driven by supply disruptions, as consumer demand rebounds from the worst of the pandemic.  It’s also notable that some of the biggest increases are in particular commodities, such as plywood, which is used in home construction and remodeling. Mills that shut down or reduced production during the throes of the pandemic in 2020 still haven’t caught up to increased demand, said Jennifer Coskren, an economist and wood products expert. And food prices are up due to a combination of higher fuel prices and trucker shortages. Outside the most volatile sectors, the so-called ""core rate"" of inflation was more modest in April, at just 3%. It’s also worth noting that the current inflation measures are skewed by the year-over-year comparison with April 2020, when the pandemic all but shuttered the economy and depressed prices across the board. All in all, economists told PolitiFact that inflation bears watching as the economy reheats, but they added that it would be presumptuous to suggest that inflation will spiral out of control, as opposed to easing once supply-chain disruptions are ironed out. Over the last 40 years, the highest number of southwest border apprehensions happened in 2000, when agents recorded about 1.6 million apprehensions. Apprehensions haven’t been that high since then, but there’s no doubt that 2021 encounters are on the rise.  So far in fiscal year 2021, Border Patrol agents have recorded about 725,000 encounters with migrants at the southwest border (most encounters resulted in expulsions). The fiscal year began October 2020 and ends in September. So 2021 data includes about four months of the Trump administration. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has said that the U.S. is ""on pace to encounter more individuals on the southwest border than we have in the last 20 years.""  It’s worth keeping in mind that Border Patrol data tracks events, not people. If a person tries to cross the border three times in a one month and is expelled each time, Border Patrol records three expulsions. Overall, illegal immigration is up, but it’s too soon to tell if it will set some kind of record.  The post said, ""Gas prices highest in a decade. Worst jobs report in 2 decades. Highest inflation in 3 decades. Highest increase in illegal immigration in 4 decades."" Prices for gasoline and for consumer products more generally are indeed spiking as a result of the post-pandemic economic recovery, but not at the historical levels cited in the post. While the April 2021 jobs report was disappointing compared to advance projections, it’s far from the worst ever. By one metric, the immigration claim is plausible, though final numbers won’t be known until this fall. We rate the statement Mostly False. RELATED: No, it isn’t clear that unemployment checks are the main reason jobs go unfilled CORRECTION,  May 27, 2021: The text has been updated to correct the figure for jobs lost in April 2020, from 20,000 to 20 million. The 20 million figure only strengthens the argument that April 2021 didn’t see the ""worst jobs report in 2 decades."" The rating remains the same.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B91100>],/factchecks/2021/may/26/facebook-posts/social-media-post-exaggerates-economic-statistics/

No, It Is Not Illegal For Businesses To Require Proof Of Vaccination
","An image appearing on Instagram and Twitter claims that businesses cannot legally require customers to provide proof of vaccination or deny entry based on vaccination status. The graphic cited the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Title III of the U.S. Civil Rights Act. The image, which has been shared by several accounts as an informational resource and by others as an object of ridicule, goes on to claim that a business employee or owner that ""violates your rights"" could face life in prison or the death penalty.  None of that is accurate, but nonetheless, the false information has been spreading. On Instagram, the image was viewed more than 62,000 times in less than two days and received more than 2,600 likes as of May 24. It is credited to The Healthy American, a right-wing website run by anti-masker Peggy Hall of Orange County, California. Facebook flagged the image as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.) We decided to find out whether the image’s claims are accurate. What Are Your Rights? Multiple states created a reopening framework that centers around requiring proof of vaccination for specific activities. California aims to fully reopen by June 15, but public universities across the state will require students to get the jab against COVID-19 to attend school next fall. Similarly, audience members at live entertainment venues are currently required to show proof of vaccination or a negative test result. Although President Joe Biden has ruled out a federal vaccination passport, New York released its Excelsior Pass in March — the first in the nation. Hawaii is exploring a similar initiative. Other states, including California and Connecticut, likely won’t create a statewide passport but expect they could emerge from the private sector. Several states have also voiced opposition to proof of vaccination requirements. In Texas, Idaho, Montana, Arizona, Florida and Utah, state officials have passed legislation or handed down executive orders that limit the use of vaccination passports. However, measures in those states only apply to government entities and state-funded organizations, not privately-owned businesses. The latter is where we find the image claiming illegality. The image cites the Fourth Amendment to support its claim that businesses cannot request proof of vaccination. The Fourth Amendment states that Americans have rights against ""unreasonable searches and seizures"" from the government, according to the Cornell Legal Information Institute. But asking a person for proof of vaccination does not constitute a search or a seizure, and private businesses aren’t government entities addressed in the amendment. If a person refuses to disclose their vaccination status, a business cannot search their pockets or vehicle for proof they are vaccinated. However, it can ask for the information to be voluntarily disclosed. If it isn’t, a business has the right to refuse entry, according to Michele Goodwin, a professor of law at UC Irvine and director of the Center for Biotechnology and Global Health Policy. ""Businesses can establish standards for entry that do not violate statutory or constitutional provisions in a state or federal law,"" Goodwin said. ""The Fourth Amendment applies to government."" In fact, even government entities like schools and the Army have historically been able to require vaccinations based on legal precedent set by Jacobson v. Massachusetts in 1905. The case upheld the power of states and other government entities to enforce compulsory vaccinations in the interest of public health. ""A community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members,"" Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote in the majority opinion in the case. The Civil Rights Act applies to all entities and prohibits discimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. However, it does not address issues of discrimination based on disability or a medical condition. Besides these restrictions, a business is generally able to choose with whom it conducts transactions and make its own rules on private property. For example, some businesses hang signs that say, ""No shirt, no shoes, no service.""  Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at UC Hastings and a member of the Vaccine Working Group on Ethics and Policy, said the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) might apply in some situations surrounding vaccination requirements. ""The Civil Rights Act is an incorrect framework here,"" Reiss said. ""The ADA may limit the ability to discriminate against people who have real contraindications, but it has to be an actual disability or limit [and] if there is one, the person is entitled to a reasonable accommodation, not necessarily to just walk in."" For instance, if someone is allergic to a component commonly found in vaccines, they may be unable to be fully vaccinated. In that case, businesses would need to provide reasonable accommodation by law. That might mean that unvaccinated customers can only enter a business if they wear a mask or are offered a virtual, no contact version of the service that the business provides. Still, the ADA only applies in instances where a person has a disability. It isn’t valid in cases where a person simply does not want to be vaccinated. ""There is a difference between mandates that schools and businesses accommodate individuals with disabilities, such as appropriate ramps, bathrooms facilities, etc., and individuals who have or might have infectious diseases that threaten the health of employees and customers,"" Goodwin said. The Penalty The image also states that ""any person who violates your rights"" can be punished under Title 18 USC Section 242, a part of the federal criminal code that specifically addresses deprivation of rights. The law states that those acting ""under the color of law"" who willfully deprive a person in the United States of their Constitutional rights can go to prison, or, in extreme cases where the action causes the death of an individual, receive capital punishment. Reiss said the code specifically pertains to officials who violate a person’s rights. It does not apply to private businesses or individuals. ""It's not relevant in this context,"" she said. Our ruling An image posted on Instagram and Twitter claimed that it is illegal for businesses to ask for proof of vaccination or deny entry to customers based on their vaccination status. Furthermore, the image alleged that business owners or employees who ""violated your rights"" could be held liable under a section of federal law that addresses deprivation of rights, which could result in life imprisonment or the death penalty. Legal experts say businesses are allowed to ask for proof of vaccination from customers. In some states, certain businesses are required to ask about vaccination status under current reopening guidelines.  Additionally, businesses can generally deny entry to unvaccinated customers, provided they offer reasonable accommodations for people who might be unable to receive a vaccine because of a disability, a medical condition or their religious beliefs. Experts say a reasonable accommodation does not necessarily mean the individual would be able to walk into the business or access their services in person. Experts also say that the law cited as punishment applies to public officials, not private businesses. No business owner or employee who asks a customer for proof of vaccination would be imprisoned for life or face the death penalty. Therefore, we rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096952840>],/factchecks/2021/may/26/instagram-posts/no-it-not-illegal-businesses-require-proof-vaccina/

COVID-19 vaccination status doesn’t impact life insurance policies

GOP bill in Michigan would restrict, but not prohibit official election communications with voters
","Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, the state’s top election official, says a Republican-backed bill would prevent election officials like her from doing an important part of their job: sharing information with voters about how to exercise their right to vote. Benson, who is running for reelection next year, has repeatedly clashed with GOP lawmakers over a package of bills that seeks to revamp the way elections are conducted in the state and curtail her office’s powers. She has objected in particular to GOP bills that would restrict access to absentee voting; in 2018, Michigan voters overwhelmingly supported an initiative that enshrined expanded access to mail ballots in the state’s constitution. One of the GOP bills, ""would make it a crime for election officials (including Secretary Benson) to share information about how to vote by mail and where to find a ballot drop box,"" Benson’s campaign said in a May 20 fundraising email. We looked at Benson’s claim and found that it overstates the proposed restrictions in the bill, Senate bill 305. It would not absolutely prohibit her office or clerks’ offices from communicating with voters. At the same time, county and local clerks and legal experts say that the bill would prohibit many of the methods election officials currently use to inform voters, and that its vague wording could expose officials to criminal charges for conventional methods they commonly use to communicate with voters. Ahead of elections, election officials routinely send out postcards and newsletters telling voters about registration deadlines and how to request an absentee ballot. Those communications often include the official’s name and sometimes their image. Clerks say this helps reassure voters that they are getting information from an official government source, rather than a party or campaign office. The bill in Michigan’s state Senate would bar the secretary of state as well as county and local clerks from using their name or likeness on publicly funded communication about an upcoming election. A violation would constitute a misdemeanor, and election officials would be subject to a fine of up to $100 for a first offense and up to $250 for any subsequent offense. The legislation defines communication as including mail, billboards, radio or television advertisements, social media posts or advertisements. It defines election-related information as dealing with voting, registering to vote, applying for an absentee ballot, submitting an absentee ballot, finding a polling location, monitoring the status of an absentee ballot or recruiting election inspectors. The bill would not prevent the secretary of state's office or clerks' offices from putting up billboards, posting to government-run social media accounts or mailing out information about how to participate in an upcoming election — so long as the name or photo of the secretary of state or clerk isn’t included. Republican state Sen. Dale Zorn, who introduced the bill, did not testify in support of it during an April 28 Senate Elections Committee meeting, and his office declined to respond to a request for comment. Republican state Sen. Ed McBroom, who spoke in favor of the legislation during the committee meeting, said the bill is designed to prevent electioneering by officials who oversee elections, even though the bill also applies to clerks who are appointed and elected clerks who are not up for reelection. But election officials and legal experts say that because the bill as it’s currently written does not narrowly define election-related communication, it could limit a wide range of avenues through which election officials currently communicate with voters. Michigan Department of State spokesman Jake Rollow said that ""the bill would make it a crime for Secretary Benson or any election official to use traditional methods to inform their communities about elections."" ""Even many social media accounts of their offices and departments, which include the name and image of their elected or appointed leader, would be banned from voter education and other critical election-related communications,"" he said. ""There is simply no evidence that it would strengthen our election system in any way,"" Rollow added, ""but there is plenty to suggest that restricting voter education would lead to voter confusion, suppression and disenfranchisement."" John Pirich, an elections attorney who represented former President Donald Trump in a 2016 election lawsuit, said the bill would prohibit clerks from replying to a voter’s email with an email address or signature that includes their name. Delta Township Mary Clark, a Democrat, said that in the months leading up to the Nov. 3 election, she was personally communicating with voters multiple times every day about the upcoming election. Many clerks’ websites which provide information about registering to vote and requesting an absentee ballot include a photo and name of the clerk. Such identifying information would have to be removed to comply with the proposed law, according to Steve Liedel, an attorney and former legal counsel to Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm. Midland County Clerk Ann Manary, a Republican, said that the bill would also bar some social media posts informing voters about how to participate in an election. ""We like to do live videos and put them on the county’s Facebook page, and we would be prohibited from doing that,"" she said. Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum said she interprets the bill as also prohibiting election-related posts from her personal Twitter account, which she uses regularly to debunk election misinformation. Liedel said that while social media accounts are free to create and use — and not publicly funded — clerks could run into problems posting from a personal account under the bill if they do so from a work phone or computer or a personal device connected to their office WiFi or while sitting in their office. Clark and Manary, who testified against the bill on behalf of the Michigan Association of Municipal Clerks and the Michigan County Clerks Association, respectively, said it threatens clerks’ ability to share trusted information with voters and subjects them to criminal penalties that don’t apply to other elected officials. ""We feel that our name is validation to our voters that it’s legitimate information when there’s so much misinformation in our world right now,"" Clark said. ""Clerks are the single most trusted source of election information."" How exactly the bill would affect the way clerks communicate with voters won’t be fully understood until the final language is hammered out. The bill is in committee right now and could change once it reaches a vote in either the Michigan House or Senate. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is likely to veto it, and even if it were enacted, it would almost certainly face court challenges. ""I just can’t see a court upholding a prohibition of a properly elected official communicating with their elected title and name to give this information,"" Pirich said. Merissa Kovach, the policy strategist for the ACLU of Michigan, said that Benson’s characterization of the bill misses the mark. Election officials ""could tell you where to vote but they couldn’t do it with attaching their name to it at all,"" she said. In some instances, the change would be a matter of removing a clerk’s name and photo from a mailer or billboard. But in other instances, she said, the bill would require clerks to operate behind a veil of anonymity in situations — like sending an email — where it makes sense to tell voters who they are. ""I’d be worried about clerks just constantly being scrutinized and at risk for committing crime and for doing the very basics of their job,"" she said. Benson’s campaign claimed that a GOP-backed bill would make it a crime for election officials to ""share information about how to vote by mail and where to find a ballot drop box."" Benson’s claim is partially accurate. The bill, as it’s phrased now, would not broadly prohibit election officials from sharing such information, but election officials say that as a practical matter, it would bar them from many of the methods they currently use to help voters, and that the language of the bill would leave them exposed to criminal charges for routine communications with voters.

Fowl play? Social media users falsely claim Arizona ballots were destroyed in chicken farm fire
","The partisan, Republican-led audit of state-certified election results in Arizona’s Maricopa County is fueling yet another baseless rumor online, as some social media users suggest that a county official intentionally destroyed ballots in a fire at his family’s chicken farm. ""A friend called me when they found out ballots were shredded at the farm,"" said one such post uploaded to Instagram on May 20. ""An hour later it was on fire. The fire burned two huge barns. It killed 162,000 egg laying hens. (Clint) Hickman is the Chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. He owns Hickman Egg Farms. This was no coincidence."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  There’s no evidence that Maricopa County ballots were destroyed in a fire at a chicken farm. Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican, said May 18 that the chicken-farm rumor is the ""the craziest conspiracy theory by far"" to come out of the state GOP’s audit. ""The craziest conspiracy theory by far is that one of the board of supervisors, who happens to own a very large chicken farm, took ballots from the 2020 election, fed them to 165,000 chickens and then had them incinerated,"" Richer told CNN’s Don Lemon. ""Now, what actually happened is that this poor man had a serious fire at one of his barns, and 165,000 chickens did die. But the idea that they had ballots inside of them … that's facially laughable.""  A screenshot of a May 20, 2021, Instagram post falsely suggesting 2020 general election ballots from Maricopa County, Arizona, were burned in a chicken farm fire. Hickman — who is not the chairman, but is a one of five elected district supervisors in Maricopa County — is also the vice president of sales and marketing at Hickman’s Family Farms, which lost two barns and over 165,000 chickens to a fire in March, according to the Arizona Republic. The fire took place at a location in Arlington, Arizona, about an hour west of Phoenix. The Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office, which investigated the cause of the fire at the farm, said in a statement that the investigation ""revealed there was no evidence of a crime."" ""The cause of the fire was listed as unknown,"" the statement said. ""The arson investigation revealed no election ballots."" The Buckeye Valley Fire District, whose firefighters responded to the scene, also told Snopes there was no evidence of wrongdoing and no evidence that ballots were destroyed at the site. Megan Gilbertson, communications director for the Maricopa County Elections Department, said the chicken-farm rumors originated in March with the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website. The Gateway Pundit published two articles on March 6 about ballots in Maricopa County. The first alleged that ""dumpsters full of shredded ballots"" had been found in the county. The second was headlined: ""After Finding Shredded Ballots in the Dumpster Earlier Today — A Mysterious Fire Breaks Out at Maricopa County Official’s Farm."" PolitiFact fact-checked the first of those two articles and rated the Gateway Pundit’s claim about shredded ballots in a dumpster False. Gilbertson told us then that all ballots for the 2020 general election were in a vault and under surveillance.  State law requires counties to keep ballots for 24 months after an election is canvassed. ""No ballots from the 2020 General Election were ever removed from the vault at the Elections Department until we had to prepare them for transport to the Arizona Senate,"" Gilbertson said in reference to the new chicken-farm claims, which she called ""false accusations."" The county’s ballots were transported on April 22 to the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix for the partisan-driven audit. Hickman and Hickman’s Family Farms did not respond to requests for comment. The Arizona state Republicans’ liaison for the audit declined to comment. There were nearly 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County in the 2020 general election, which saw Arizona vote for President Joe Biden. Maricopa County conducted a hand count audit of a sample of ballots, as is required by state law, and it hired independent firms to conduct a forensic audit of tabulation equipment. The county found no abnormalities. National, state and local officials affirmed that Biden won a free and fair election, as judges across the country rejected lawsuits aimed at overturning the election in favor of former President Donald Trump. There remains no evidence of widespread voter fraud. An Instagram post claimed that Arizona ballots were shredded and burned in a fire at a Maricopa County official's family chicken farm. A fire did break out in March at a family chicken farm connected to an elected official on the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. But an investigation by the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office found no evidence of a crime — and no election ballots. Maricopa County stored all ballots for the 2020 general election securely in a vault until they were transported on April 22 — more than a month after the fire — for the audit led by state Senate Republicans, an elections department spokesperson said. Richer, the county recorder, called the chicken-farm rumor ""the craziest conspiracy theory by far"" related to the audit. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2AA8C0>],/factchecks/2021/may/25/instagram-posts/fowl-play-social-media-users-falsely-claim-arizona/

A professor’s ideas are wrongly recast as a nefarious federal plot
","A series of screenshots posted on Instagram build the shaky framework for a big claim — that Christine Grady, chief bioethicist at the National Institutes of Health who is married to Dr. Anthony Fauci, has a ""secret plan to put psych drugs in drinking water … to get Americans vaccinated."" ""Why does the federal government need a secret plan?"" the post says. ""Because half of the American citizens refuse to take vaccines.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The screenshots come from a March 22 blog post that points to a 2018 paper and its author as evidence for this plan. But that doesn’t make sense, and here’s why.  The blog post shows a screenshot of the paper’s abstract in PubMed, a database of more than 32 million citations and abstracts of work that appear in biomedical and life sciences journals. PubMed is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the U.S. National Library of Medicine, which is located at the National Institutes of Health. The site doesn’t include the full text of journal articles. Rather, it links to the original source.  That’s the case here for the paper by Parker Crutchfield, an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy at Wetern Michigan University. The paper, titled ""Compulsory moral bioenhancement should be covert,"" was published in a journal called Bioethics.  Moral bioenhancement deals with using drugs, surgery or other devices to improve moral decision-making, as Slate wrote in 2017.   In his paper’s abstract, Crutchfield wrote that while ""some theorists argue that moral bioenhancement ought to be compulsory, I take this argument one step further, arguing that if moral bioenhancement ought to be compulsory, then its administration ought to be covert rather than overt.""  The blog post then shows more screenshots of an article by Crutchfield that appeared in The Conversation in August 2020. The headline says: ""‘Morality’ pills may be the US’s best shot at ending the coronavirus pandemic, according to one ethicist."" In the article, Crutchfield made the case that the problem of people who choose not to follow public health guidelines concerning the coronavirus — ""defecting from the public good"" —  could be solved by moral enhancement, such as a psychoactive pill that increases cooperative behavior. ""A solution would be to make moral enhancement compulsory or administer it secretly, perhaps via the water supply,"" he wrote.  But Crutchfield, a university philosophy professor, is exploring ideas in both the journal paper and this article — he’s not laying out Grady’s secret plan to drug Americans via our water supply.   His paper appeared on PubMed, which is maintained by a branch of the National Institutes of Health, but it wasn’t published there. It appeared in one of the many journals PubMed links to on its website.  And we found no evidence connecting Grady to the work that appears in the blog post.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809703B1C0>],/factchecks/2021/may/25/instagram-posts/professors-ideas-are-wrongly-recast-nefarious-fede/
