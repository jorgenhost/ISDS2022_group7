Lee commissioner Tammy Hall says jobs program brought 1,200 high-wage jobs
","
A campaign advertisement mailed in late September for Lee County Commission District 4 incumbent Tammy Hall touts efforts to ""RECOVER JOBS,"" citing ""FIRST INITIATIVE — Economic incentive program created over 1,200 high wage jobs since 2009.""

Hall, a Republican, is seeking re-election in the Nov. 2, 2010, general election and is challenged by Debbie Jackow, who is running with no party affiliation.

Hall says she is pleased with local government efforts to boost Lee’s economy in southwest Florida, and her campaign piece spotlights that effort along with other claims.

So what about job creation efforts?

In September 2008, Lee commissioners -- including Hall -- approved a plan to set aside $25 million from county reserve funds for economic development efforts.

That fund came to be known as the Financial Incentives for Recruiting Strategic Targets -- or FIRST -- Initiative by the county’s Economic Development Office.

But, has that effort really created 1,200 high wage jobs in about two years as Hall’s campaign message, sent the week of Sept. 27, claims?

Commissioners have voted to award money from the fund to four companies to expand operations here:

• April 2009: Gartner Inc. -- a technology research and advisory company -- received $350,000 from FIRST fund and $1.5 million from other state and local incentive programs. Gartner plans to hire 200 people, starting in 2011 and continuing through 2015. The jobs are expected to have an average annual wage of $60,000.

• June 2009: Paramount Transportation Logistics Services Inc. was given $300,000 from the FIRST fund and $300,000 from other local and state programs to create 100 jobs with an average wage of $48,500 by 2012. About 36 people had been hired by the end of June, the most recent data available.

• July 2009: Source Interlink Cos. -- a magazine publisher and distributor -- receives $1 million from the FIRST  fund as part of plan to add 350 jobs by 2011, but the hiring schedule has been revised. The company now expects to begin hiring this year, adding about 50 jobs. The added jobs will have an average annual wage of $65,000.

• February 2010: Algenol Inc. was awarded $10 million in FIRST funds to build a biofuel research facility off Alico Road in south Lee County. Unlike the other incentive agreements, the deal with Algenol is not tied directly to job targets, but the company now employs 67 people. About 30 of those employees have transferred from Baltimore. The center expects to eventually employ more than 100, with an average annual wage of $85,000.

Those numbers add up to about 750 jobs to be created through 2015, but just more than 100 people have been hired so far, according to the latest information from Lee’s Economic Development Office.

So where did Hall get the 1,200 number?

""If you look at the county’s information, those are the jobs being created,"" Hall said.

But not just by the FIRST funds.

Hall said she asked the Economic Development Office for information on the projects funded through FIRST. She said the numbers she got back apparently reflect all job incentive programs.

""I guess they put everything together,"" Hall said. ""It’s misspoken to say it is all from FIRST, but the numbers are correct.""

Lee County constructs incentive agreements using a variety of programs, including the Lee County Job Opportunity Program, which can pay up to $6,000 per full-time job and a similar Florida program, the Qualified Targeted Industry Refund Program, which pays tax refunds of up to $3,000 for each full-time job.

If you include incentive agreements using those programs, the county has announced agreements  that total 1,048 jobs through 2015.

About 189 people have been hired so far.

Is a job pledged the same as a job created?

""We are creating those jobs under contract,"" Hall said. ""We are very proud of the progress we have started to achieve.

""I think the message is that we are out there, doing our part as government to allow those jobs to accumulate,"" she said.

Does ""FIRST INITIATIVE -- Economic incentive program created over 1,200 high wage jobs since 2009"" accurately convey that message and the facts? The number of jobs created is overstated by about 38 percent and most remain unfilled now. Also, the FIRST INITIATIVE program isn’t the only source of incentive money being used. So we rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2010/oct/03/tammy-hall/lee-commissioner-tammy-hall-says-jobs-program-brou/
"['Rhode Island', 'Social Security', 'John Loughlin']","
Loughlin compares Social Security to a Ponzi scheme
","
  
As Democrats fight to hold on to Congressional seats across the country, they have repeatedly accused Republicans of trying to privatize or even do away with Social Security.

We checked one such claim by Rhode Island candidate David Cicilline on Saturday.

GOP candidates have struck back with their own charge: Social Security, they say, is like a Ponzi scheme.

Cicilline's District 1 opponent, Republican John Loughlin, has drawn the parallel at least three times during his campaign. Last week, in an interview with PolitiFact Rhode Island, he went so far as to compare the U.S. government's administration of Social Security with the scheme committed by convicted fraudster Bernard Madoff whom he said ""went to jail for doing the exact same thing this country is doing with Social Security.""

In perhaps the most extensive example, Loughlin had this to say while speaking in February at a Rhode Island Voter Coalition forum:

""For those of you who haven't retired yet, Social Security is a Ponzi scheme. The people who are working are paying for the people who are retired. There is no Social Security trust fund per se. Your money doesn't go into a big bank and come out when you retire. You're hoping there will be enough young people working to be able to pay your Social Security when you retire. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a classic Ponzi scheme. It's a textbook definition.""

If he's right and Social Security is indeed a Ponzi scheme it would make Madoff's $65 billion fraud look like child's play. So PolitiFact Rhode Island decided to take a look.

We had a little help on this one from our partners at PolitiFact Wisconsin, who conducted a thorough examination of the Ponzi scheme issue after a Senate candidate there made a similar claim. We'll borrow from them.

Let's start with some history. The scheme is named for Charles Ponzi, a Boston swindler who conned investors out of millions by promising them returns of up to 100 percent in just a few short weeks, then instead of investing their money, he used it to fund his personal habits. Ponzi kept the scam going by bringing in new investors, whose money he used to pay off existing ones.

The current definition on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website identifies it this way: ""A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.""

Sound familiar? Loughlin thinks so. He insists that's the same process used to finance the federal Social Security program. And he believes that when benefits owed exceed the money coming in, the system will fall apart.

There are similarities. As PolitiFact Wisconsin notes, Social Security uses taxes on current wage earners to finance the retirement checks of millions of Americans. But what about Loughlin's assertion that there is no Social Security trust fund with which to pay back wage earners?

In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, a spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration said ""The Social Security Trust Funds currently holds over $2.5 trillion in interest-bearing Treasury securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.""

As Wisconsin notes, that essentially makes it an I.O.U. for current wage earners.

But there is a second, critical component that defines a Ponzi scheme: fraud. To reach the level of this kind of scam, an investment setup must intentionally con investors, while making efforts to convince them that the finances are legitimate.

Loughlin might say that's the case. And he's right to say the Social Security system is struggling financially as more Baby boomers reach retirement age. But that's very different than intentional deceit.

In fact, Social Security was set up in the midst of the Depression to serve as an insurance plan of sorts for the elderly. Since then, participants and those who pay into the system have been well aware of how the program is run.

For that reason, University of Rhode Island economics Prof. Rick McIntyre, called the comparison ""unfair and inappropriate.""

A Ponzi scheme is guaranteed to run aground when the pool of investors is tapped out, whereas the Social Security administration's troubles could be remedied by raising taxes or other restructuring, should the federal government choose to do so, he said.

""It is not a Ponzi scheme because there is no intent to deceive,"" McIntyre added.

Mitchell Zuckoff, author of ""Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend,"" and a URI graduate, addressed the persistent comparison in a recent interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""The important difference and the fundamental difference is that there is no secret to how Social Security is run,"" he said. ""No one is being misled; no one is taking the money and running...""

Without that key element of deceit, we find it hard to find Loughlin's analogy -- or that of anyone who uses it -- credible.

But there's one more thing. Loughlin doesn't just compare Social Security to the Ponzi scheme concept, he takes it a step further and draws a parallel with the specific case of Madoff, who is believed to have run the largest fraud of this kind in history.

Publicly measuring a 75-year-old U.S. government program against such a massive crime is not only overstating the issue, it's bordering on irresponsible.

False.

"['Oregon', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Scott Bruun']","
Scott Bruun says Kurt Schrader cut $500 billion from Medicare, hurting seniors
","
Politicians love seniors. It's a bloc that stays put, pays attention and, most importantly, votes.

So it's no surprise that the over-65 crowd figure prominently in elections. In Oregon's 5th Congressional District, Republican challenger Scott Bruun is accusing Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., of voting to cut $500 billion from Medicare, and hurting seniors.

In Bruun's first television ad, ""Broken,"" he says: ""I believe that $500 billion in cuts to Medicare is wrong, and hurts our seniors."" In his second ad, ""Seen,"" he goes even further: ""The Kurt Schrader record. $500 billion in cuts to Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Schrader's vote threatens thousands of Oregon seniors and their access to their current coverage.""

Really? Thousands of seniors? At risk of losing their current health care?

A quick check shows this is a common complaint among Republicans. Remember, in March not one Republican in Congress voted for President Barack Obama's controversial health care overhaul.

PolitiFact National has already debunked the notion that seniors will be hurt by changes to Medicare called for by Obama's health reform plan.

Bruun's campaign statements give the impression that less money will be spent on seniors, that $500 billion will be lopped from Medicare immediately, and that seniors are in danger of losing health care benefits. All that is misleading.

To back up, Medicare is the basic federal health plan for seniors 65 and older. Medicare Advantage is a more generous version that some seniors choose to buy from private providers.

It's true the federal government will reduce the growth of future spending on Medicare over the next decade. The reforms to Medicare will result in $500 billion in savings over 10 years. But the law does not eliminate $500 billion out of the current budget for Medicare. There are no cuts to guaranteed Medicare benefits.

In fact, spending on Medicare will actually increase over the next decade, reaching $845 billion in 2019, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. Without reform, Medicare spending in 2019 was projected to be $943 billion.

So then the question becomes, does a reduction in future spending mean a reduction in quality or quantity of medical services?

No, says Tricia Neuman, director of the Kaiser foundation's Medicare Policy Project.

The $500 billion in savings will come from a mix: Higher insurance premiums for wealthier seniors, reductions in payments for Medicare Advantage plans, a new panel to oversee reimbursement rates, and smaller-than-expected increases in payment rates to hospitals and other service providers each year. (Neuman provides an easy to understand 19-minute  tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website.)  

Payment reforms to Medicare Advantage programs are long overdue. The programs are popular, but cost more. Reducing the payments to the private companies that provide the programs is projected to help trim $136 billion from Medicare Advantage over 10 years.

But it's not all reductions and savings -- something else Bruun doesn't flesh out.

On the plus side, health care reform means Medicare recipients will get more preventive health care services, such as wellness visits, and they won't face the ""doughnut hole"" gap in prescription coverage left by the original Medicare Part D.

Cynthia Chilton, a Multnomah County counselor with Senior Health Insurance Benefits Assistance, said elder advocates are watching, but the situation looks OK for now. Premiums for next year will not skyrocket, she said, and seniors will get free preventive care visits starting in January.

She rejects the claim that changes to Medicare will harm seniors.

""No, it doesn't mean that seniors will be hurt. It might be better,"" Chilton said.

Finally, we note that as evidence, the Bruun campaign offered a July 2009 story by The Oregonian, which includes this sentence: ""The health care bill written by House Democrats calls for $500 billion in Medicare cuts over 10 years to help offset the enormous cost of providing care to 45 million uninsured Americans.""

The context of the story was that Oregon providers could suffer disproportionately if payment rates go down. That's because services here are cheaper than in other states. The story ran in print with the headline ""Oregon health care hit for being too efficient.""

More significantly, it was written before Oregon's congressional Democrats wrangled higher Medicare reimbursements for providers in Oregon in negotiations for their yes votes on reform in March. Overall, the health care reforms are designed to reward efficiency -- and that may be a good thing for seniors here.

PolitiFact Oregon's view is that Bruun's statement contains some element of truth -- the $500 billion figure. But it ignores critical facts that would give voters a different impression.

The ad conflates actual cuts with decreases in future spending, over the next decade for a program expected to expand, and it fails to mention any of the benefits to seniors under the new Medicare program.

We rate this statement Barely True.

Kurt Schrader says Scott Bruun wants to privatize Social Security
","
As sure as the sun rises each morning and more people ease into retirement, the future of Social Security becomes a boiling issue every election.

It’s happening again in the race for Oregon’s 5th congressional district. Incumbent Democrat Kurt Schrader has claimed that Republican Scott Bruun advocates ``privatizing Social Security.’’

It happened most recently during a Sept. 10 debate at the Salem City Clubwhen Schrader said this: `` ... My opponent apparently still believes in the same old direction that George Bush had before, which is to privatize social security.’’

It’s a combustible allegation that could lead some voters to believe they would be at the mercy of an unpredictable stock market as they step into retirement. Many voters, especially older ones who rely on Social Security and who vote in high numbers, would not be pleased if they thought their cherished safety net was going to be less of a sure thing.

Schrader is just one of a big number of mostly Democratic candidates talking about Social Security and suggesting Republicans would leave seniors stranded. But is his claim accurate?

First, a little background is needed.

Social Security is a retirement and disability program guaranteed and fully funded by the U.S. government. That means if you qualify for benefits, the check will be delivered without fail each month just as it’s been since 1935 when Social Security was created by Congress.

It’s an enormously popular program that currently provides benefits to 53.4 million people. But it has a huge budget and it’s only getting more expensive as the population ages, a larger number of people qualify for benefits and fewer workers are left to shoulder the cost.

Here’s how AARP summarizes the dilemma: ``The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the reserve fund and payroll taxes will cover full payment of benefits through 2037.’’

That’s why Congress and politicians periodically float suggestions for saving Social Security. In 2005, President George W. Bush devoted a portion of his State of the Union address to a plan that would allow workers under age 55 the option of diverting up to 4 percent of their payroll taxes into personal accounts. He argued that private investing could bring better returns while easing some of the fiscal pressure on Social Security.

The proposal died as most Democrats opposed it, as did some Republicans. Critics said that unscrupulous financial advisers would charge huge fees and that the stock market’s unpredictability could strand millions of seniors without the retirement nest egg they’d counted on.

And that brings us to 2010 and Schrader vs. Bruun.

Schrader’s claim is based on comments Bruun has made over the years, including an Oct. 22, 1996, letter to the editor published in The Oregonian. ``We can address this problem by growing the economy and by slowly converting contributions into private investments, which will earn a much higher rate of return,"" he wrote then.

Today, he takes a bit less muscular and more nuanced view. In the section of his campaign website devoted to issues, Bruun flatly states he does ``not support a complete privatization of Social Security.’’ At the same time, he would allow workers ``the option to invest a portion’’ of their payroll taxes in private accounts. That is essentially the same idea that crashed and burned in 2006.

``I am committed to pursuing bipartisan solutions to this challenge, and I am eager to look at any proposal that will protect Social Security benefits for today’s seniors without increasing taxes. I do not support a complete privatization of Social Security for younger workers, but I do believe that option to invest a portion of their payroll taxes to conservatively managed private equity accounts should be a choice available to future recipients of Social Security benefits,’’ Bruun says on his website.

So what about Schrader’s claim that Bruun ""apparently still believes in the same old direction that George Bush had before, which is to privatize Social Security""?

Bruun does seem to be suggesting an approach similar to Bush’s in that he would allow younger workers to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds monitored by the government. But that's a far cry from privatizing the entirety of Social Security, which Bruun has said he does not support.

If he follows Bush, Bruun would change nothing for workers 55 and older. They would not be able to opt into a personal account.

And for younger workers (under 55 in Bush’s plan), the possibility of creating a personal retirement account would be totally optional -- one could choose to stay in the traditional government-run system and receive benefits as promised. Bruun’s spokeswoman Alee Lockman says Bruun has not suggested a specific age limit for workers who want to contribute to private funds. He says only ``younger workers.’

It’s beyond dispute that, if he’s elected to Congress, Bruun would vote to partially privatize Social Security. But Schrader exaggerates, suggesting that Bruun wants to fully privatize the system.

That’s simply not the case and it’s the reason we rate his claim Half True.

Bill Flores says the Austin American-Statesman has called Rep. Chet Edwards' attacks false
","
PolitiFact Texas has gone prime time! 
In Bill Flores' new TV ad in his bid for a U.S. House seat held by Chet Edwards of Waco, titled ""Austin Paper"" — that would be the Austin American-Statesman — ""truth"" plays prominently. The narrator starts off: ""The Austin newspaper says Congressman Edwards' attacks on Bill Flores are false."" Just in case viewers miss that declaration on first pass, the narrator continues: ""Edwards is not telling the truth about Bill Flores."" 
Flores makes nearly the same claim in a radio ad posted on his website: ""The Austin newspaper investigated Edwards' attack ads and found them to be false."" 
We didn't know we'd done that. 
To date, Edwards has criticized Flores on a number of fronts, including his views on veterans health care, his voting record and his position on earmarks, most of which we haven't dug into. 
In April, we rated an Edwards statement to be True — that Flores has never voted in a general election in the House district. In September, we gave a False rating to Edwards' claim that an oil company Flores ""helped run laid off over 3,000 workers and then paid off its top executives with millions."" 
To our inquiry — what the hey? — Flores' campaign manager, Matt Mackowiak, counseled against being too picky about the wording of the ads. Mackowiak said Flores' ads don't say that every fact check we've done of Edwards returned a False rating. 
Mackowiak also said the TV ad clearly refers only to our September item on Flores' employment history, pointing out that the video ""has the date of the PolitiFact article."" We checked out that detail. At the time that a narrator is evoking ""the Austin newspaper,"" the screen shows the ""Austin American-Statesman"" nameplate, the PolitiFact url and a date: ""September 26, 2010."" 
Oops: Our review of Edwards' statement appeared in print and online Sept. 15. 
We informed Mackowiak of the date conflict. He later told us that the campaign had fixed the date and sent new copies of the ad to the outlets running the ads. 
While the Flores campaign is changing the ad, we'd suggest a new line for the narrator: ""The Austin newspaper also finds this message to be only Barely True.""",/factchecks/2010/oct/02/bill-flores/bill-flores-says-austin-american-statesman-has-cal/

Cicilline says Loughlin has talked about privatizing Social Security
","
It may be the most frequently used weapon in the Democratic arsenal this midterm election season: accusing the GOP of wanting to ""privatize"" Social Security.

So many Democrats have made such claims about their Republican opponents that our national PolitiFact team and those in other states have reviewed the issue on more than a half-dozen occasions. Most found that the Democrats have distorted the Republican position to some degree, with the claims receiving Half True or Barely True ratings.

Here in Rhode Island, the topic takes on particular significance because we have one of the highest percentages in the country of people 65 and older, more than 14 percent. Nearly 140,000 Rhode Island seniors receive Social Security benefits.

Democratic congressional candidate David Cicilline has joined the chorus of critics in his new ""Fighting For Social Security"" campaign tour, suggesting to seniors that his GOP opponent, state Rep. John Loughlin, would gamble with their money.

At his first stop, on Sept. 23, he told a group of elderly voters at Pawtucket's St. Germain Manor Senior Center: ""The Republican candidate has talked about privatizing Social Security, and when there was a resolution [in the Rhode Island General Assembly] urging Congress not to privatize Social Security, he was one of seven people to vote no on that. So we know where he stands on that issue.""

Speaking quite literally, it's true that Loughlin has talked about the concept of privatization. It would be hard to be a Republican -- or a Democrat -- running for federal office and not address whether that's a good or bad idea.

And Loughlin acknowledges his 2005 vote against a Rhode Island House resolution pressing Congress not to privatize the program. Why did he vote that way? He says he didn't think it made sense to completely block the concept.

Moving on to the next part of his claim, we asked Cicilline for examples of where Loughlin ""stands on the issue"" of privatization. His campaign provided us with several. The first was in a quote from Loughlin in The Providence Journal in February.

""I think that citizens should be able to choose to put a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes into private investment accounts, but it should be completely voluntary. Recent stock market volatility is going to cause some people to want to stay within the current system and that's fine,"" Loughlin told a reporter.

A second, similar reference came two days after the September primary when Loughlin told The Pawtucket Times that ""younger workers should be allowed to privatize some of their Social Security"" to give them greater flexibility.  

Like our PolitiFact counterparts in other states, we question whether Loughlin's suggestion that workers be allowed to voluntarily divert a portion of their payroll to a personal investment account constitutes a desire to privatize.

What we found was that this issue is very much a war of words. Loughlin believes the option to investment in a personal account is simply that, an option. Cicilline counters that voluntary changes are no different than full privatization because they would eat away at the Social Security funding stream, destabilizing the program and taking it one step closer to elimination.

""I don't think we're claiming he wants to abolish Social Security, but this isn't us putting words in his mouth,"" Cicilline campaign manager Eric Hyers told us. ""He used the 'P' word.""

Loughlin dismissed the idea that voluntary accounts and full privatization are comparable -- or that Cicilline knows where he stands on the issue -- calling his opponent's comments ""completely and totally false.""

Though Loughlin does support the concept of allowing people to make choices about parts of their contribution money ""That is not the same by any stretch of the imagination as privatizing Social Security,"" he argues. ""Not even close.""

Privatization, Loughlin believes, implies a mandated change, something he says he opposes.

""This is a very common line of attack on the Democratic attack wheel ... "" Loughlin continued. ""The playbook tells them, go to all senior centers and the nursing homes and say the Republican candidate wants to take away your Social Security and kick you off and they want to put it in that risky thing down on Wall Street called the stock market.""

At the same time, the Republican is sharply critical of the current Social Security system, on several occasions even comparing it to a Ponzi scheme. PolitiFact Rhode Island will examine that comment in a separate item Sunday.

But let's get back to the privatization question. Taking it point by point, Cicilline is correct when he says Loughlin has talked about privatization. It's important to note however that words matter. Had Cicilline made a more stringent accusation, we might have judged it differently.  
He's also right that Loughlin voted against the resolution urging Washington to oppose it.

On the third point, however, Cicilline misses the mark. He does not appear to know where his opponent stands on the issue. Loughlin himself says Cicilline is flat out misinterpreting his position. Yet that hasn't stopped Cicilline from criss-crossing the state using the accusation to scare elderly voters and win votes.

Yes, Loughlin has expressed dissatisfaction with the current program and has publicly supported tinkering with the system to offer a private option. But to our knowledge, the GOP candidate has never advocated for making the program fully private. And he says he has no plans to do so.

We rate Cicilline's claim Half True.

Republican governor candidate Scott Walker says he eliminated the waiting list for long-term care for seniors
","
As Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker seeks a promotion to governor, Democrats have waged a steady attack, accusing him of gutting important services in a single-minded push to cut taxes.

So, it’s no surprise to hear Walker, a Republican, highlight a popular program that has grown steadily on his watch.

Case in point: Family Care -- the long-term care program for seniors.

Walker did it in a fever-pitch victory speech on primary election night:

""Before I took office, there was literally a waiting list of 3,000 older adults waiting for long-term care in our community. Today not one senior in our community is on a waiting list because we stood up and led the way. We can do it for the state as well.""

On the biography section of his campaign website, he more directly takes credit: ""As County Executive (Scott) ... eliminated the waiting list for long-term care for older adults through the Family Care program.""

So, has the waiting list disappeared? And is Walker correct in claiming credit for it?

When we asked the Walker campaign for backup on the claim, Walker returned the call himself -- and took personal responsibility for what he said was an error in his primary night statement.

The waiting list, he said, actually had been 2,500 -- not 3,000.

Good to know, but our main interest was whether it disappeared.

Let’s dig into the claim.

Family Care was designed to provide better care for seniors and end the waiting list for services. The program now provides 6,400 older adults in the county with residential options, transportation, meals and other services.

Indeed, there was no need for Walker to fall on his sword -- the state department that tracks Family Care enrollment says the list did reach 3,000 at one point.

The list started shrinking in mid-2000, when Milwaukee County and four other counties started pilot projects under the Family Care program, according to multiple sources we interviewed. The program is administered by the county, but the state funds most of its budget.

A host of public documents and sources in and out of state and local government show the waiting list for the Family Care program was eliminated as of the end of June 2002.

And Walker was executive at the time, though he was sworn in less than 2 months earlier.

So that part of Walker’s statement is correct: There was a big waiting list before he took office, and today no one waits.

That leaves the larger question of who deserves credit, the main point in Walker’s touting of the success of the program. For that, a timetable is important. We based this chronology on county and state audits, budget documents, newspaper stories and the recollection of key players:

1995: Health officials in the administration of then-Gov. Tommy Thompson launch redesign of long-term care in Wisconsin, including nursing home, community- and home-based care.

1998: Thompson announces the selection of Milwaukee as a Family Care county, after years of lobbying led by Stephanie Sue Stein, the county’s Department on Aging chief.

1999: State lawmakers and Thompson approve Family Care funding in the state budget bill. At the time, Walker was serving in the state Assembly from Wauwatosa and supported the budget as a member of the Republican majority.

2000: Pilot program in Milwaukee County starts up.

2001: In November, the Milwaukee County Board and then-County Executive F. Thomas Ament approve a county budget that fully phases in Family Care during 2002. It keeps the county on course to extinguish the waiting list by June 2002.

2002, May 9: Walker is sworn in as Ament’s successor after winning an April special election prompted by Ament’s forced retirement amid the county pension scandal.

2002, July 1: Family Care is fully up and running, and the waiting list is a thing of the past.

The timeline makes clear the waiting list was on a track to be eliminated well before Walker took office -- and nearly gone by the time he won the job.

Walker’s primary-night phrase -- ""We stood up and led the way"" -- appears to point voters to the early days of the fight to get the Family Care pilot program approved for the county. At the time, Walker was not yet county executive and does not appear to have played a role in the Legislature beyond joining a bipartisan group to support of the pilot programs.

Walker argues that his actions since taking county office have kept a waiting list from redeveloping.

He points out -- correctly -- that he and other county officials battled the state over adequate funding, especially after deficits threatened the program.

The program gets almost all of its funding from Madison, so keeping it going is far easier than other county programs that rely heavily on local property taxes. And in 2004, Walker and the County Board put $12.2 million in county funds into Family Care to bring it back from insolvency.

During his tenure, the program has grown from serving some 2,900 seniors in the spring of 2002 to serving more than 6,400 seniors in Milwaukee County today. Walker gets praise from a key advocate for seniors, Tom Frazier, the former head of the Coalition of Wisconsin Aging Groups.

""Scott Walker has been extremely supportive,"" Frazier said.

Let’s take stock.

Walker’s claim on the end of the waiting list is accurate -- and he did play a role both in starting the program (minor) and keeping it going (more substantive). But the central part of the claim is that as county executive he eliminated the waiting list.

That list ended less than two months after he took office and mainly through the efforts of county officials who preceded him. Walker has supported the program as county executive, but nearly all of the heavy lifting on the waiting list was done before he arrived on the scene. And preventing a waiting list from reappearing is different than taking credit for ending it.

Candidate says Isakson is no fiscal hawk
","
Note to readers: a letter to the editor responding to this item appeared Oct. 11, 2010. The letter appears at the end of the article. 
Chuck Donovan gave us a challenge.

The Libertarian nominee for Georgia's U.S. Senate seat asked AJC PolitiFact Georgia to check out some claims on his campaign website about the incumbent, Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga. Voters will decide among Isakson, Donovan and Democrat Michael Thurmond on Nov. 2.

We looked at Donovan's blog, which included a post called ""Isakson's Inconsistencies."" The post challenged the Republican on a host of issues, but one line questioning Isakson's conservative credentials on federal spending stood out.

""Mr. Isakson has never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending,"" Donovan began. ""However, he has voted in favor of: (a) many substantial increases in federal spending; and (b) tremendous annual deficits.""

Challenge accepted.

Isakson spokeswoman Sheridan Watson showed us a page on the senator's website full of news releases and statements highlighting votes and bills he supported to curb spending. It also noted Isakson has twice won the Taxpayers' Friend Award from the National Taxpayers Union for his efforts to curb federal spending.

""Happy investigating,"" Watson wrote us.

Donovan's post was researched and written by fellow Libertarian Allen Buckley, an Atlanta-based attorney and certified public accountant who won 2 percent of the vote in an unsuccessful campaign against Isakson in 2004.

Let's look at the first part of Donovan's claim: Isakson has never proposed or voted for a substantial cut in federal spending.

The senator's website offers four main arguments to dispute Donovan. Isakson has voted often to cap discretionary spending, programs that are not entitlements such as Medicare and Social Security. Discretionary spending, which includes the Defense Department budget, has amounted to about as much as 40 percent of the total federal budget in recent years. 
Second, the senator has been a big proponent of biennial budgeting, preparing and adopting budgets for two-year periods. The federal budget is currently adopted on an annual basis. Biennial budgeting proponents argue the idea would allow the federal government to adopt two budgets in one year and spend the second year taking more time to improve how government works. Others, including the Congressional Budget Office, have warned biennial budgeting could backfire if the revenue streams are uncertain, which makes it difficult to budget accurately.

Third, Isakson supports the Pay It Back Act, which would require that money repaid by banks and other businesses who received taxpayer dollars from the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) be used toward deficit reduction.

The fourth idea is legislation introduced in 2006 and 2007 by U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., called Stop Over-Spending. Isakson co-sponsored the bill. SOS aimed to reduce the federal deficit and essentially balance the budget by 2012 through slowing the rate of growth for entitlement programs, except for Social Security, if Congress doesn't meet deficit reduction targets. It also gave the president a line-item veto. The Senate never voted on the bill.

The SOS bill received positive reviews from the conservative organizations National Review and the Heritage Foundation, saying it would have forced Congress into disciplined spending. University of Virginia political science professor James Savage was one of the few academics who studied the bill when it was introduced and he had problems with it. Savage and others contend that deficit reduction is not sound economic policy during a recession because more federal investment is needed to revive the economy, either through cutting taxes, lowering interest rates or spurring consumer spending through a stimulus. 
Now, let's look at whether Isakson has voted in favor of many substantial spending increases.

Donovan's camp says Isakson went along with Republicans on a series of spending increases when the GOP controlled Congress. Much of Donovan's argument on this point deals with bills from 2001 to 2004, when Isakson was in the U.S. House. During that time, Isakson voted for several bills during a time when the gross federal debt grew from about $5.8 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2001 to nearly $7.4 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2004. The debt was projected to rise to $13.8 trillion for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Isakson voted in 2002 to spend $350 billion over 10 years for a prescription drug benefit for Medicare. Additionally, he voted for bills that increased defense spending by about 10 percent a year and legislation that raised the discretionary spending cap from $661 billion in 2001 to $819 billion in 2004. The senator has been more of a fiscal hawk since Democrats became the majority party in Congress in 2007, Donovan said.

The senator voted in 2006 with 51 of his 54 fellow Republicans to increase the national debt limit by $787 billion, raising the debt ceiling to $9 trillion. Some senators defended the decision, saying additional funds were needed for health and education programs. Isakson also voted in 2008 for the $700 billion TARP but has since criticized expansion of that legislation.

So where does this leave us on Donovan's statement about Isakson? 
The October 1, 2010 truth-o-meter says an allegation made on the website of Chuck Donovan, Libertarian Party U.S. Senate candidate, is half true. The article notes that I researched and wrote the provision—which is correct.  
The provision reads:  Mr. Isakson never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending; however, he has voted in favor of:  (a) many substantial increases in federal spending; and (b) tremendous annual deficits.  The article did not consider the four facets of the statement, but instead focused on spending.  The allegedly untrue part is the part about Mr. Isakson’s proposals relating to, and votes for, substantially cutting spending. 
Cited in favor of Mr. Isakson are proposed caps on discretionary spending, Mr. Isakson’s support for biennial budgeting  and Mr. Isakson’s support of the Pay It Back Act, which reportedly requires money paid back by banks and other businesses who received taxpayer dollars from the TARP be used towards deficit reduction.  These things are not bad things, but they do not reduce spending at all.  Concerning caps on future discretionary spending, it appears the reporter or the truth-o-meter judges, or both, failed to distinguish a cut in spending from a limit on future spending increases. 
Also cited is the Stop Over Spending (SOS) bill, which I was told by the reporter with whom I met was the only thing the Isakson campaign cited in its defense.  As I explained to the reporter, nothing in the SOS bill requires that any spending be substantially cut at all.  I thoroughly provided reasoning therefore.  I gave the reporter examples of things that would result in a substantial cut in spending, such as repeal of Medicare Part D.  According to the Medicare Trustees, Medicare Part D had a present value liability figure in 2008 that exceeded 31 percent the net worth of all Americans combined as of the end of 2009.  I encourage all readers to read the SOS bill (it can be found online). 
Also cited in favor of the senator is his vote against a spending increase relating to Iraq and Hurricane Katrina  recovery efforts because it included $700 million in earmarks.  Voting against a spending increase is not proposing, or voting in favor of, a cut (or a substantial cut) in spending. 
The only thing cited to cut spending was small proposed cut in Medicare and Medicaid that would reportedly have cut 2 percent from budget deficit forecasts over five years.  The spending cuts were estimated to be $36 billion.   The per-year average spending cut would be $7.2 billion (i.e. $36 billion divided by 5).  Total federal spending for 2008 amounted to approximately $2,983 billion.  I do not believe something that could cut spending by 0.2 percent (i.e. 7.2 divided by 2,983) could reasonably be considered to substantially cut spending.  It is akin to a 2 cent saving on a good that would ordinarily cost $10. 
After publication, through email correspondence with the reporter, I was told the truth-o-meter judges felt the average person would consider the SOS and pay-go, etc. as significant efforts to cut spending.  I replied by first noting that Senator Isakson consistently voted against pay-go when his party was in power.  I also offered the following example that an ordinary reasonable person could understand:  If an individual said his family spends $1,000 per week but plans to limit future spending increases, but the individual said no other actions would be taken regarding spending, no ordinary reasonable person would think that person had planned to cut his family’s spending, let alone cut the spending substantially. 
Martindale-Hubbell is the organization that ""rates"" lawyers, and the rating is done by other lawyers.  I have, and for many years have had, an AV rating from Martindale-Hubbell.  An AV rating is the highest rating in terms of work quality and integrity (including honesty).  Simply put, I tell the truth. 
In sum, Senator Isakson never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in spending.  Thus, I told the truth. 
The GAO said in 2007:  ""GAO’s long-term simulations continue to show ever larger deficits resulting in a federal debt burden that ultimately spirals out of control.""   While I am very disheartened by the truth-o-meter article, what is really sad is that you have helped Mr. Isakson so he can continue fulfilling GAO’s prophesy.

Lone Star First, funded by the Democratic Governors Association, says Rick Perry endorsed injecting girls with an HPV vaccine without parental consent
","
Zeroing in on Gov. Rick Perry's long tenure in public office, Lone Star First, an organization that's funded and supported by the Democratic Governors Association, unleashed an attack ad called ""Cracks."" It features a photo of Perry that splinters more with each charge the association levels against him. 
""Twenty-five years as a politician changes you,"" a narrator says in the ad posted on YouTube Sept. 28. ""You think injecting 11- and 12-year-old girls with a controversial drug, without a parent's consent, is a good idea. You think it's right to use a government takeover of Texas homes and property so foreign companies can get rich. You spend taxpayer money on a fancy mansion while Texas faces an $18 billion deficit. On the issues, 25 years as a politician has changed Rick Perry, for the worse."" 
We've previously touched on Perry's past advocacy of a toll-road network, his rental digs and the budget shortfall. Now we wondered about Texas girls receiving a ""controversial drug"" without parental consent. 
On Feb. 2, 2007, Perry issued an executive order that required the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to adopt rules mandating that Texas girls entering sixth grade receive a vaccine against the human papillomavirus. Certain types of HPV, a sexually-transmitted virus, can cause cervical cancer and genital warts. 
Critics said the vaccine, Merck & Co.'s Gardasil, was too new to declare safe. Some said too that Perry's order would infringe on parental rights or give girls a false sense of security, leading them to be sexually active too young. 
Lawmakers blocked the plans, and earlier this year, Allison Castle, Perry's press secretary, told us that the governor's office considers the mandate ""null and void."" She said Perry ""will not pursue it in the future."" At the time, we rated Barely True Perry's statement that his executive order didn't make the vaccine mandatory. 
But did Perry's move mean children would receive shots without parental consent? 
Brannon Jordan, a spokesman at the Democratic Governors Association, pointed us to three news articles to back up the statement. 
While the articles quoted parents expressing anger at Perry for requiring something they considered none of his business, none of the clips mention parental consent. 
The mandate, which was scheduled to go into effect for the 2008-09 school year, included an opt-out ""in order to protect the right of parents to be the final authority on their children's health care."" It ordered the Department of State Health Services to allow parents dissenting for philosophical or religious reasons to request a conscientious objection affidavit form. That form enables parents to enroll their children in public school even if they lack state-required immunizations. It's automatically granted as long as parents provide all required information. 
Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman at the Health and Human Services Commission, told us that ""the child would only get the vaccination if the parent took the child to get it."" 
Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman at the Department of State Health Services, said: ""Vaccines cannot be given to children without consent of a parent or a legal guardian.""     
Texas law lists two primary people who can consent the immunization of a child — the guardian and a person authorized under the law of another state or a court — and secondary people if the former are unavailable, including a grandparent, stepparent, or aunt. 
Janet Realini, a physician and president of Healthy Futures of Texas, a San Antonio-based nonprofit striving to reduce teen and unplanned pregnancies, told us that the mandate would have been no different than state requirements for numerous immunizations that Texas requires children need to attend public school, such as the polio vaccine, measles and hepatitis B.  
When we checked back with the DGA, spokeswoman Emily Bittner told us that she wasn't familiar with the ad. We asked to speak with someone who was, but no one had gotten back to us as we were wrapping up our research. 
Where does that leave us? 
Perry's executive order would have required Texas girls to receive a vaccine against HPV before entering sixth grade. The order included an opt-out for parents who objected to the vaccine. 
But there's no evidence — not a scintilla of proof — that shots would have been given without parental consent, and saying so preys on the fears of parents who objected to Perry requiring the vaccine. 
Parents and guardians are gatekeepers for children getting the vaccinations required for students to go to Texas schools. Perry's failed mandate would not have changed that, and the ad sounds like Perry endorsed forcing families against their will to vaccinate their children with a scary drug.

"['Oregon', 'Taxes', 'Chain email']","
E-mail claims DeFazio wants to tax everyday banking transactions
","
An intriguing e-mail landed in the inbox of Oregon PolitiFact. We couldn’t figure out who was circulating the message -- but it accused Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., of the unspeakable: a tax on everyday banking transactions.

The e-mail, forwarded Sept. 24 by a reader, claims that  DeFazio wants to levy a 1 percent tax on every financial transaction, like depositing a Social Security check or cashing a paycheck. The letter claims his proposed legislation had the blessing of President Barack Obama’s ""finance team"" and that Democrats are waiting until after the Nov. 2 election to pass H.R. 4646. (DeFazio faces opposition from relative unknown Republican Art Robinson this fall.)

The e-mail repeats language from -- and links to a letter to the editor -- posted to the website of the Standard-Examiner in Ogden, Utah. That letter reads, in part, regarding Obama::

""His plan is to sneak it in after the November election to keep it under the radar. This is a 1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution i. e. Banks, Credit Unions, etc. Any deposit you make, or move around within your account, i. e. transfer to, will have a 1% tax charged. If your pay check or your social Security or whatever is direct deposit, 1% tax charged. If you hand carry a check in to deposit, 1% tax charged, If you take cash in to deposit, 1% tax charged.""

But the letter on the Standard-Examiner website made no mention of DeFazio. How curious. We decided to check it out. And we learned that H.R. 4646 is indeed actual legislation whose subject has something to do with taxation. But that’s where the similarities end.

The ""Debt Free America Act"" was introduced by U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Penn, in February 2010. He proposed a 1 percent tax on all money transactions, ""including cash transactions, checks, credit cards, those processed through the Federal Reserve Bank, and those collected at the point of sale."" Fattah’s idea was to use the money to pay down the national debt, and eventually replace the income tax. He has proposed similar legislation since 2004.

H.R. 4646 had no support -- and certainly not from Obama’s ""finance team"" -- and is now dying a quiet death in committee. Yet the resolution continues to live online, where the DeFazio connection has been repeated by a former Hernando County (Fla.) commissioner.

DeFazio did introduce, along with Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and other House Democrats legislation in December 2009 to assess a 0.25 percent tax on stock transactions. HR 4191 would not affect retirement accounts such as 401(k)s, education accounts or health savings accounts. And regular investors would not be affected because the first $100,000 traded each year would be exempt. The idea was to make Wall Street shoulder more of the costs borne by Main Street. The bill is in committee.

Penny Dodge, DeFazio’s chief of staff, says the congressman opposes H.R. 4646. An unamused DeFazio doesn’t know who is behind the e-mail attack.

""It’s slanderous,"" DeFazio said of the electronic claim. ""I have nothing to do with the bill, no one pays any attention to the bill.  It’s chronically introduced, and never received any attention before this.""  

He gets backup from Fattah, whose press secretary sent PolitiFact Oregon a statement:

""There have been many misleading and flat-wrong assertions about my bill, H.R. 4646, the Debt Free America Act. Congressman Peter DeFazio is not a cosponsor of H.R. 4646 and it is completely inaccurate to say he is a proponent of the Debt Free America Act.

The statement is not accurate -- and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate this Pants on Fire.

Space forgets to mention food stamp cuts in letter to anti-poverty advocate
","
Short-term memory loss was rampant among many Democrats in Congress in August, when they passed a $26 billion bill to provide money to help states avert teacher layoffs and health program cuts. They said the measure was paid for entirely by closing corporate tax loopholes, and they studiously avoided mentioning an even bigger source of money for the bill: a nearly $12 billion cut in future food stamp spending. Taking money from the poor to pay for teachers was not a discussion they relished.

Memories have not improved over time, as a Sept. 2 letter from U.S. Rep Zack Space shows.

Space, from Ohio’s 18th Congressional District, wrote to Jack Frech, who heads the Job and Family Services agency in Athens County, to defend the legislation after Frech called and left message for the east-central Ohio congressman. Space responded by saying the bill is ""providing badly needed funding for teacher jobs.""

Frech had worried about the growing ranks of poor and low-income Ohioans in this sluggish economy. But the activist in him got especially fired up when he learned that Congress was going to help states and local communities meet their needs for teachers and health care providers who serve the poor -- while cutting back on an earlier expansion of food stamp spending. So he contacted Space, and Space responded with his letter on Sept. 2.

Space wrote that threatened teacher cuts, and their effect on students, would have been ""intolerable."" Three hundred teachers in his district alone had been in jeopardy, Space wrote.

""This bill will save teacher jobs immediately, and it is completely paid for -- by closing an egregious tax loophole that encourages American companies to ship jobs overseas,"" Space’s letter said. ""It goes without saying that we could badly use that money here at home to ensure all our children get a decent education. I refuse to support policies that sell out our children, our future, to overseas corporate interests.""

Space told Frech in the letter that "" I recognize that you had reservations about this provision; however, I wasn’t elected to simply stand on the sidelines while Ohio teachers are pushed out of the classroom.""

This sounds noble enough. For purposes of discussion, PolitiFact Ohio will put aside any dissent from Republicans over whether the move to save local teacher jobs was the right thing for Congress to do at this time, because that’s not Frech’s point. Nor is his point whether a teacher-layoff crisis really loomed, a debate that continues with a recent Columbus Dispatch survey of the state’s largest school districts that found many had no layoff plans and put the money aside in case they need it later.

Frech’s complaint is simpler: Did Congress really have to take the money from a program that helps the poor? Couldn’t it have found the money somewhere else?

Because we were in touch with Frech when reporting on this issue this summer, Frech shared the letter with us, as he has with others. Frech is a leading anti-poverty voice in southeastern Ohio.

So what of Space’s claim in the correspondence that the teacher bill was completely paid for by closing the corporate loophole?

The Plain Dealer has been through that one before, and noted its fallacy on Cleveland.com. PolitiFact’s national operation has been through it, too, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made the same claim in a press release.

As PolitiFact said on Aug. 13, several days after Pelosi’s statement:

""According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, the corporate tax changes in the bill that Pelosi is referring to will amount to $9.8 billion between 2010 and 2020. These are a mix of tax policies that only a CPA could understand, from ‘rules to prevent splitting foreign tax credits from the income to which they relate’ (worth almost $4.3 billion in newly captured revenue) to ‘denial of foreign tax credit with respect to foreign income not subject to United States taxation by reason of covered asset acquisitions’ (worth more than $3.6 billion), to ‘limitation on the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to section 956 inclusions’ (worth $704 million).

""But that $9.8 billion in corporate tax cuts won't cover the full $26 billion cost of the bill. The bulk of the money comes from something Pelosi's office chose not to mention in the press release -- almost $12 billion in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (more commonly known as the food stamp program) beginning in 2014. Another $1.1 billion would come from cuts to advanced refundability of the earned income tax credit starting in 2011. The earned income credit is a tax credit that benefits the working poor. Several billion dollars more would come from a variety of spending cuts known as rescissions.""

Pelosi and other Democrats, including Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, have said separately that they hope to restore the food stamp funding before the cuts kick in in 2014. And Pelosi’s office in July at least offered a fact-sheet on the teacher bill’s funding that included the food stamp cuts.

Space’s letter to Frech was silent on that, however.

PolitiFact gave Pelosi’s statement a Barely True rating, noting that at least her office had provided details of the food stamp cuts in other settings. But we have seen no instances of Space acknowledging the food stamp cuts.

Space, like most other Ohio Democrats, was silent on the cuts when a group of the Ohio members held their own news conference after the Aug. 10 vote, hailing its passage. Had Rep. Marcia Fudge of Warrensville Heights not broken that press conference silence by mentioning the cuts, the lawmakers would have moved on without breaking stride.

That’s not saying they are happy to pare back federal spending on the poor. When the subject is brought up by reporters, most say they voted for the bill reluctantly, choosing among the limited options that congressional leaders and the White House gave them -- options they say they were forced to swallow in order to make the bill budget-neutral. That was the only way to win key Republican votes in the Senate.

Stuart Chapman, chief of staff to Space, told us in an e-mail that ""no one has been a more aggressive advocate for the dispossessed in in Southeastern Ohio than Congressman Space."" Space has fought for other anti-poverty programs, he said, a point reiterated by a phone call we received soon after speaking with Chapman, from Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, executive director of the Ohio Association of Second-Harvest Foodbanks.

Hamler-Fugitt said that Space works hard to help the poor. But Hamler-Fugitt agrees with Frech’s point as well -- that ""we’re all outraged"" at the way the food-stamp cut was passed.

That gets us back to Space’s letter. Frech, well-recognized in southeast Ohio for his work, had contacted Space to complain about one facet of one bill.  Space not only neglected to address it; he wrote something that was untrue by saying the teacher-aid bill was paid for entirely by closing a tax loophole.

And Space certainly knew about the food-stamp cut, if for no other reason than he was present at the news conference where Fudge raised the issue. That doesn’t make him the grinch who stole food stamps. It merely makes him one more member of Congress who has tried not to talk about it.

Chapman, the chief of staff, told us that a letter to a constituent is not intended ""to be a manual of every facet of legislation."" But Frech didn’t want a manual. By ignoring Frech’s concern -- and passing right over the bill’s single biggest funding source -- Space’s letter took on the air of gamesmanship.

Hide and seek, anyone?

When we run a statement through the Truth-O-Meter that not only is false but also suggests that someone is playing games, we start looking for the matches. We rate Space’s statement to an Ohio anti-poverty advocate Pants on Fire.

"['National', 'Ethics', 'Barack Obama']","
Former lobbyists wrote ""A Pledge to America""? Not plural, and help is questionable
","
President Barack Obama was back on the stump recently, giving a fiery speech to a crowd of young people at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Obama said they should vote for Democrats this fall, or Republicans would gain control of Congress and stall his agenda.

""If the other side does win, they will spend the next two years fighting for the very same policies that led to this recession in the first place, the same policies that left the middle class behind for more than a decade, the same policies that we fought so hard for to change in 2008,"" Obama said.

""Just look at the agenda that the leaders of the other party unveiled last week. They call this 'Pledge to America.' That's what they called it. And in case you're wondering how serious they are about changing Washington, this pledge was actually written with the help of a former lobbyist for AIG and a former lobbyist for Exxon-Mobil.""

Obama has often decried the influence of lobbyists on the federal government. And while he does have policies in place to keep former lobbyists out of his administration, his administration has made some signficant exceptions. We've found enough exceptions to his campaign promise that we've rated his promise on tougher rules against a revolving door for lobbyists as Promise Broken. Still, many ethics experts say Obama is doing a better job at closing the revolving door than previous presidents.

We wanted to fact-check Obama's statement that lobbyists had helped write ""A Pledge to America."" The document, created by the House Republican leadership, is a mix of broad principles and specific proposals, such as ""permanently stop all job-killing tax hikes"" and ""repeal the job-killing health care law."" It is largely silent on how to fix the  significant imbalances in the federal budget that will reach a critical point in the coming decades.

When Obama said the pledge was ""written with the help of a former lobbyist for AIG and a former lobbyist for Exxon Mobil,"" we thought he meant lobbyists, plural. But he was actually talking about one person who lobbied for two corporations, the White House confirmed. That person is Brian Wild, a staff member for the Republican leadership.

How does Obama know Wild helped author the document? That news came from a report from the the liberal website The Huffington Post. Wild is listed as the document owner on an electronic draft of the report obtained The Huffington Post. Wild is also a former lobbyist who worked for The Nickles Group. Public filings show that Wild was listed as a lobbyist for the insurance giant AIG from 2006 to 2008 and for Exxon Mobil Corp. from 2006 to 2009. He also lobbied for other companies, including Comcast, the Southern Co., the National Mining Association, Monsanto, FedEx, General Motors and others.

A Republican spokesman didn't dispute that the digital signature on the document was Wild's or that he worked on the document. But Republican members themselves wrote the document -- collaborating on different sections, and Wild simply coordinated the project, said Brendan Buck, the communications director for the ""Pledge to America"" project.

""The Pledge to America was written by Republican members of the House based on the priorities they heard from the American people,"" Buck said. ""Suggesting anything else is an ugly act of political desperation.""

Because of Obama's wording, rating this item is a bit tricky. He said the pledge ""was actually written with the help of a former lobbyist for AIG and a former lobbyist for Exxon Mobil."" First, we think the reasonable interpretation here is that two former lobbyists worked on the pledge, but that's not the case. We've only been able to find one former lobbyist who worked for AIG and Exxon Mobil.

Next, Obama said the the pledge was written ""with the help of"" a former lobbyist. In this context, what does ""help"" mean? Wild certainly ""helped"" in the sense that he was a staff member who worked on the project. But we don't know how much he did or didn't contribute to the actual text. We asked to interview Wild on this point, but we were turned down. Buck said that members themselves wrote the document, but we can't independently verify that. We should add here that we're not entirely naive; we know the unwritten rule among staff members of both parties is that you always downplay your role to make the boss look good. So we don't know how much Wild did or didn't help write the pledge.

And the point here is that Obama's doesn't know either. His implication is that former lobbyists had some sort of nefarious influence on the document that would benefit powerful special interests. Actually, the document is a compilation of fairly general talking points and principles that Republican members have been talking about for months.

So we take that together and find that one former lobbyist -- not two -- helped write with the document. And it's unknown whether that help was anything more than cutting and pasting. So we rate Obama's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/30/barack-obama/former-lobbyists-wrote-pledge-america-not-plural-a/

Alex Sink says she stood up for local control of schools
","
Florida Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, running as a Democrat for governor, says she's in favor of local control for schools.

In a Sept. 17, 2010, TV ad, Sink says: ""Tallahassee politicians and bureaucrats have no business trying to run our local schools. When they've tried, I've stood up to them to protect local control. And I'll stand up to them again as a parent and as your governor.""

Education is an important topic for many voters and the bill that Sink based her claim on was one of the most controversial during the Florida Legislature's 2010 session. So it's important for Sink, running for governor, to present herself as a leader on the topic.

Sink campaign spokeswoman Kyra Jennings told us Sept. 27 that Sink was referring to Senate Bill 6 -- the bill that would have overhauled teacher pay and tenure statewide. The bill, pushed by Republicans and strongly opposed by teachers unions and Democrats, was filed in the Senate on March 1. The bill was approved by the Senate on March 24 and the House on April 9. Gov. Charlie Crist vetoed the bill April 15. Keep that timeline in mind -- it's important here when evaluating Sink's claim.

We did a Nexis search on Sink and ""Senate Bill 6"" and the first reference we found was a March 31 news release from Sink's campaign -- one week after the Senate voted in favor of the bill.

Sink said in the press release: ""These proposals are bad for our children and our state. As a mother whose two children went to Florida public schools, I feel strongly that our local school districts should be the ones making these kinds of decisions for our students and teachers -- not politicians in Tallahassee. I also have a serious problem with placing even more unfunded mandates on our local school districts, as they are already facing significant budget concerns."" 
Jennings sent us a list of newspaper articles and Sink press releases that showed her opposition to Senate Bill 6. Here are excerpts of what Jennings provided, in chronological order:

In a press release on April 8 -- one day before the House vote -- Sink stated: ""It's clear that the people of Florida don't want Tallahassee politicians dictating a rigid, one-size-fits-all policy to our local school districts. Florida is a diverse state and every classroom is different. As a mother whose two children graduated from Florida's public schools, I strongly believe in preserving local control of local schools.""

In a press release April 9 -- the day the House voted in favor of the bill -- Sink called on Crist to veto Senate Bill 6 and ""stand with the people of Florida against this attempt by Tallahassee politicians to take control away from our local schools. This Tallahassee cram-down is wrong for our children and our state,"" said Alex Sink. She launched an online petition drive urging Crist to veto the bill.

On April 16, the Palm Beach Post stated that Sink rallied more than 16,000 Internet opponents in that online petition drive.

So by March 31 -- after the Senate approved it -- Sink clearly opposed Senate Bill 6. She reiterated her opposition April 8 -- the day before the House voted for it and again April 9 when she urged Crist to veto it. 
But where was Sink earlier? 
During the first two weeks of March, teachers unions, educators and others statewide were loudly objecting, as seen in numerous news articles and letters to the editor.

A brief glance at some big-name voices in the Senate Bill 6 war who publicly opposed the bill before Sink did:

The statewide teachers union: The Florida Education Association sent a press release March 8 bashing the bill. A Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times article March 3 quoted the FEA's general counsel criticizing the bill and quoted Miami Sen. Frederica Wilson, a Democrat and former educator, opposing the bill. ""This is just another attempt to destroy public schools,"" Wilson was quoted saying.

Florida School Boards Association: Wayne Blanton, executive director of the Florida School Boards Association, opposed the bill by early March. A March 8 Tallahassee Democrat article stated the Leon County School Board watched a video of Blanton in which he said: ""I've been doing this 35 years, as you well know, Senate Bill 6 may be one of the worst education bills I've ever seen filed in the history of the Florida Legislature.""

Broward and Palm Beach school leaders: By March 25, teacher union presidents in Broward and Palm Beach -- two of the larger counties in the state -- voiced opposition, according to the Sun-Sentinel. Pat Santeramo, president of the Broward Teachers Union, called it ""probably the worst legislation developed in years. It is just pitiful."" Robert Dow, president of the Palm Beach County Classroom Teachers Association, called it ""a sledgehammer to public education."" On the same day, the Miami Herald quoted Broward Superintendent Jim Notter calling the bill ""a crushing blow against our most important employees, our teachers.""

The people: On March 31, the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald wrote that Crist's office had received 700 calls on the issue the previous week, House lawmakers received hundreds of thousands of e-mails and thousands of phone calls and a Facebook page called ""Stop Senate Bill 6"" had almost 17,000 supporters.

One other question to raise about Sink's claim: Is it fair to say that politicians and bureaucrats tried to run our local schools? For Senate Bill 6, we will define ""bureaucrats"" as Florida Commissioner of Education Eric J. Smith. The department didn't propose the bill, though Smith was on record as supporting it by March 26.

Finally, though Senate Bill 6 failed, politicians and bureaucrats already have quite a bit of say in local schools. Let's name a few examples: state law dictates how many days a year schools must be in session, a range of dates for holding the FCATs and what subjects must be taught.

We asked Jennings how much credit Sink should get for opposing the bill a week after the Senate approved it.

""Not only did she stand up before the governor made the decision to either sign or veto this bill but before it was passed through both the House and Senate to strongly oppose it, she headed up a citizens' petition where over 12,000 Floridians signed it,"" Jennings said.

So let's review: Sink's ad claims she ""stood up"" to politicians and bureaucrats ""to protect local control."" Sink clearly opposed Senate Bill 6 -- proposed by politicians and supported by the Education Commissioner -- which would have led to new teacher standards in schools statewide. But she was late in her opposition -- a week after the Senate voted for it and weeks after unions and educators started their much publicized protest. Thousands of Floridians had weighed in by calling or e-mailing elected officials in Tallahassee by the time Sink spoke up. Sink has omitted important context here, but she did stand up. We rate her claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/30/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-she-stood-local-control-schools/

Did Steve Chabot vote to take health care away from kids?
","The House Majority PAC, a group aligned with Democrats, released a new ad criticizing Republican congressman Steve Chabot’s record. Chabot is locked in a tight race with Democratic challenger Aftab Pureval to claim the seat in Ohio’s 1st Congressional District. The ad says Chabot ""voted to cut health care for kids, affecting up to half the families at Cincinnati’s own Children’s Hospital."" The ad’s text, in full: ""While they shouldn’t have to worry, some kids can’t escape it. But Steve Chabot voted to cut health care for kids, affecting up to half the families at Cincinnati’s own Children’s Hospital. The insurance industry that gave Chabot’s campaign over $700,00 got their way. Just like they did when Chabot voted to rollback protections for pre-existing conditions. Steve Chabot listens to them, not us."" So did Chabot actually vote to deny health care to kids? And would it have impacted around half of the patients at Cincinnati’s Children’s Hospital? We wanted to find out. It is accurate Chabot voted for the GOP-backed American Health Care Act, though the bill didn't pass. If passed, the measure would have rolled back provisions from President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, including protections for people living with pre-existing conditions and cuts to Medicaid, on which many poor children rely. About half of the patients at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center are covered through Medicaid. But we don't know how many children specifically would have been affected. In 2017, Steve Chabot voted to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act. The House Majority PAC noted that Chabot’s vote in question was related to the American Health Care Act, the GOP-backed plan to overhaul Obamacare. The measure narrowly passed the house with a 217-213 margin before it failed in the Senate. Along with leaving it up to states how much of the ACA should be overturned, the AHCA would have reduced $880 billion in Medicaid spending over a 10-year period, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The AHCA would have retained some components of Obamacare, but also would have rolled back state-by-state expansions of Medicaid, which covers millions of low-income children. More than 35 million children are enrolled in Medicaid in 2018, constituting the largest group in the program, although they represent a smaller share of expenditures compared to other groups. In Ohio, Medicaid covers two in every five children. The AHCA would have altered Medicaid’s financing, ending the current federal-state partnership and converting the program to a per-capita or block grant starting in 2020.   Following the House vote on the bill in May 2017, research released by Avalere Health, a Washington D.C.-based healthcare consulting firm, estimated how much child health could be threatened if Medicaid faced the changes laid out in the bill. The organization found that, nationally, children’s Medicaid would get hit with reduced funding of $43 billion over 10 years under a per-capita cap model, with reductions in spending becoming more dramatic each year. The Affordable Care Act also raised Medicaid’s minimum income eligibility limit for children from 100 to 138 percent of the poverty line. This was done in the 34 states, including Ohio, that expanded Medicaid under the ACA. It allows children with families incomes below 138 percent of the poverty line, regardless of age, to be covered by Medicaid. The AHCA plan would lower the eligibility level back down to 100 percent of the poverty. It's unclear. The House Majority PAC refers to a WCPO Cincinnati story in which a doctor at Cincinnati’s Children Hospital, Dr. Ray Bignall, said that the bill would have hurt children because of its cuts to Medicaid, on which poor children rely. He also said that about 50 percent of the young patients at the hospital are covered through Medicaid. The hospital is similar to other Children’s hospitals across the country, which depend on Medicaid funding as half of the patients at these institutions are also enrolled in the program. Because these hospitals need the money to keep operations afloat, losing covered benefits and enrollees could lead to decreased revenues and ultimately shrink the types of services the hospitals are able to provide children, regardless of their insurance. Chabot’s campaign told us that the WCPO story is about the Senate version of the bill, not the House version, and that the House bill ""did not treat Medicaid the same way."" In the same story, Dr. Bignall also is quoted saying, ""The cuts are essentially just as deep as they were before. It seems that this is a core element of the legislation that isn't going anywhere."" It is true that there were changes in the Senate bill, but both versions would have ultimately phased out the extra money the federal government provides to states as an incentive to expand Medicaid eligibility, and both would put the program on a budget, ending the open-ended entitlement that now exists. Several analyses have found the House bill’s funding plan would lead to extensive shortages in every state, but the Senate version would deepen long-term Medicaid cuts even further. The House Majority PAC says Chabot voted to take away children’s health care, impacting about half of the kids at Cincinnati’s Children’s Hospital. It revolves around Chabot’s vote for the Republican-backed American Health Care Act, which was estimated to have reduced $880 billion in Medicaid spending over the next 10 years, a program on which millions of poor children rely. If the House (or Senate) version of AHCA had passed, the financial restructuring of Medicaid could have resulted in severe cuts to the program, and thus, children losing health coverage. But the exact impact on patients at Cincinnati’s Children’s Hospital is unclear, and Chabot's vote wasn't specific to the hospital.

Does Mike Braun support the lawsuit to end Obamacare?

","Throughout the country, Democratic candidates are singing a common tune, warning that their Republican opponents want to end protections for pre-existing conditions. In Indiana, incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly recently accused his Republican challenger, Mike Bruan, of supporting the Texas lawsuit that aims to cancel Obamacare. This isn’t the first time Donnelly has made the claim, but this time, Braun had a chance to respond to it. In the second and final Indiana Senate debate, the three candidates — Donnelly, Braun, and Libertarian Lucy Brenton — said what they intended to do in order to keep health care insurance premiums affordable for middle- and lower-income families. In his response, Braun criticized the Affordable Care Act, saying that it was ""doomed to fail, because you had big government get in cahoots with big health care, specifically big health insurance."" He stressed that he was opposed to any replacement of Obamacare that does not cover pre-existing conditions. Donnelly responded by saying, ""What he said is not true. Mike supports a lawsuit that would end the Affordable Care Act, that would end pre-existing conditions. So all of you watching out there tonight, if you have someone in your family with diabetes, with arthritis, with asthma — their coverage goes away of Mike’s lawsuit is successful. As I said, that’s how important this is, those are the facts, and he can’t deny that."" Braun, however, did deny that, and said, ""As a Republican, you get swept into the fact that you would support that lawsuit. That is not the case."" He then pointed to his experience in the private sector, saying, ""We have done things like health savings accounts, telemedicine where you can actually get healthcare when you’re on the road, transparency, consumer-driven. That’ll knock the cost down, because my policy costs one fourth of what his Obamacare policy costs. There’s no disputing that, and I’ve done that in the real world, he’s crafted something with big health care doomed to fail."" Did Donnelly falsely assume that Braun, as a Republican, would support the lawsuit to end Obamacare? The lawsuit and what it might mean Donnelly was referring to a lawsuit filed in a U.S. district court in Texas in February 2018 and backed by 18 attorney generals and two governors, all of whom are Republican. The basis for the Texas lawsuit is the individual mandate. While Obamacare essentially forced insurance companies to cover everyone, it also contained a mechanism to incentivize everyone to get coverage by imposing a tax penalty on individuals who were not insured. In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to purchase health care, precisely because it was backed by a tax penalty. However, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the penalty on not having coverage to zero. This led a group of 20 states to challenge Obamacare in court again, arguing that as the individual mandate could not be enforced, the entire law had become unconstitutional.   If the lawsuit is successful and the ACA is repealed, the regulations protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions will also be affected. Linda Blumberg, a health policy analyst at the Urban Institute, had previously told us, ""There would be much more damage beyond the issue of people with health problems being denied coverage, but that would in fact be one outcome."" Where Braun stands on the lawsuit Braun, who is not currently in office, has not made a lot of statements relating to the Texas lawsuit. When asked about the lawsuit in an interview to Politico, Braun said: ""Sure, anything that’s going to actually get rid of it,"" he said of the ACA. ""And then be ready to come back and talk about what you’re ready to do about pre-existing conditions and no limit coverage. That’s where you don’t hear much conservative talk."" This quote essentially sums up Braun’s rather consistent position on health care: He supports coverage for pre-existing conditions, but maintains that they should guaranteed through market-based solutions, not government intervention. Politico, RTV (an Indianapolis ABC affiliate), Joe Donnelly and we here at PolitiFact have cited the Politico interview as a source on Braun’s position regarding the lawsuit. It seems that the candidate hasn’t made any other comments in support of it, but he hasn’t said anything to the contrary, either. Braun’s office told us that ""Mike Braun supports covering pre-existing conditions, and believes plans that work for Hoosiers will come from market-driven solutions, not more of what big government and the insurance industry force upon them."" While stressing Braun’s commitment for the maintaining protections for pre-existing conditions, his office did not address his position on the lawsuit. Our ruling Braun said, ""As a Republican, you get swept into the fact that you would support that lawsuit. That is not the case."" Braun only seems to have made one comment with regard to the lawsuit to repeal the ACA, in which he said he supported it, but stressed his commitment to maintain protections for pre-existing conditions through other means. Those other means, though, are unspecified vague, so it’s hard to give him much credit.

Who's to blame for almost killing Obamacare? Democrats point to New York's John Faso
","In 2017, as Republicans considered measures to repeal and replace Obamacare, the House Budget Committee took an important preliminary vote. It decided 19 to 17 to advance the American Health Care Act. That means, the Democratic Party says, that Rep. John Faso of New York  ""cast the deciding vote to deny protections for pre-existing conditions."" The claim is in a new ad the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee put on the air in the closing days of the race in New York Congressional District 19 south of Albany, where Faso faces a challenge from Antonio Delgado. Faso, the DCCC says, could have stopped the whole bill, one that critics say could have been deeply harmful to people who need the protections the Affordable Care Act provides. It only failed later because the Senate lacked the support for its version. Was Faso the deciding vote? Let’s look at the math. The committee vote on March 16, 2017, was 19-17. That means it passed by two votes. But if just one lawmaker who voted yes had voted no instead, the count would have been 18-18, a tie. ""It fails if it is a tie,"" DCCC spokesman Evan Lukaske told us. And that could have stopped everything that followed, he said. Couldn’t any of the others have done the same thing? How can you say one member was the deciding vote? The DCCC allows that any member might have made a difference, but it doesn’t mean Faso couldn’t have been the key. Three other Republicans had voted no because they thought the bill didn’t do enough to kill the health program. Regardless of reasons, Faso could have joined them. ""He could have made the decision to kill it,"" Lukaske said. In fact, the Times Herald-Record, a newspaper covering the Hudson Valley region, had a front page with Faso’s picture and the headline, ""Deciding vote,"" with a story saying the congressman kept the ""controversial health care bill alive."" The front page is shown in the DCCC ad. The committee vote was to move the bill along, a necessary step for putting the bill on the House floor. But Republican leaders including Speaker Paul Ryan acknowledged it would need changes to win full House approval. When the Budget Committee voted, the bill had provisions calling for reducing Medicaid payments to states. It had language eliminating penalties for people who refused to buy health insurance. It called for changing the subsidy system for those buying coverage. And it would have relaxed the rule that said insurers could charge their oldest customers no more than three times the premiums they charged their youngest ones. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill, as it existed at that point, would have led to 14 million more people being uninsured in 2018, a figure rising to 21 million in 2020 and 24 million in 2026. Democrats and health policy groups warned that if states got less money for Medicaid, they would pare back their programs, inevitably leaving some people with fewer medical services or more hurdles for enrollment. They said older customers with private insurance would face price hikes, and the subsidies to help pay would be inadequate. Republicans supporting the bill pointed out that it included money to help states stabilize their insurance markets. The CBO said states would probably use those grants ""to limit the costs to insurers of enrollees with very high claims."" At this point, would the bill have killed protections for pre-existing conditions, as the DCCC claims? The answer is indirectly, it could have weakened protections -- but the question is academic because the House made changes to the bill before its May 2017 passage. One included an amendment allowing states to seek waivers from other ACA rules, including one that health policy groups said would have eroded requirements for providing medical services for patients who need them the most. This could lead to a new round of debate on that final House bill, but we have covered that repeatedly and the point here is different: The DCCC says Faso could have stopped everything with his committee vote. The DCCC says John Faso ""cast the deciding vote to deny protections for preexisting conditions."" Before we rule, it’s important to note that states had their own insurance rules before the ACA. New York already prohibited charging higher premiums based on health status. PolitiFact looked at this more fully when examining a related claim about Faso. We are interested here in whether Faso was the deciding vote -- whether, as the ad suggests, he could have stopped it all. We need not go far to decide, because the same kind of claim was used by Republicans against Democrats in past elections, when Republicans blasted Democrats for passing the ACA in the first place. They noted how a procedural motion needed for the bill passed by a single vote. Here were some of those claims: Bill Nelson ""the deciding vote"" on the health care law (2012) Warner cast ""the tiebreaking vote"" on Obamacare (2013) Mark Udall 'passed Obamacare with his vote' (2014) Russ Feingold cast deciding vote on Obamacare (2015) There’s more, but you get the gist. Faso was one of 19 House Budget Committee members who voted for the early version of the House repeal-and-replace bill last year. Had he voted no, things might have changed. But the same can be said for 18 others. To point out Faso as the singular villain or hero way overstates his role. Just as we did repeatedly on the ACA claim, we rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/nov/05/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/whos-blame-almost-killing-obamacare-democrats-poin/

FALSE: Attack ad’s claim Tony Thurmond was ‘reprimanded’ by Obama
","Was candidate for California schools chief Tony Thurmond ""reprimanded"" by the Obama administration over assault and sexual harassment problems in his school district? That's one of the eye-opening claims in a recent TV attack ad by a group supporting Marshall Tuck, Thurmond’s opponent in the race. The two Democrats are running for State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Thurmond is a state assemblyman who represents Richmond, Berkeley and other East Bay communities and is supported by teacher unions. Tuck is a former education executive backed by charter school groups. The incumbent, Tom Torlakson, will be termed out in January after serving two four-year terms. The candidates and groups supporting them have produced a flurry of negative ads in recent weeks after raising tens of millions of dollars, turning this typically low-key statewide race into a highly-contested campaign. We wanted to know whether there was evidence to support the claim Thurmond was ""reprimanded"" by the Obama administration. Our research Before becoming a state lawmaker, Thurmond served on the board of the West Contra Costa Unified School District, based in Richmond, from 2008 to 2012. The TV attack ad refers to a formal censure of the district by the Obama administration, which was addressed to the district’s superintendent. Here’s the full version of the attack ad: ""Before he was running for State Superintendent, politician Tony Thurmond was responsible for a school district with widespread budget problems. Ranked last in the state for failing to serve students of color. Sued for leaving at-risk students in rotting trailers with mushrooms growing in the floors. Reprimanded by the Obama Administration for failing to address widespread sexual harassment and assault in district schools. Tony Thurmond failed the students he was supposed to help. California deserves better."" Marshall Tuck-supporting PAC ad targeting Tony Thurmond, 2018 from EdSource on Vimeo. The ad was produced by Students, Parents and Teachers supporting Marshall Tuck, an independent expenditure group created by EdVoice, a nonprofit that supports charter schools. During the voiceover, the ad uses misleading text to blur the distinction between action taken against the school district and Thurmond specifically. The text reads: ""TONY THURMOND: Reprimanded by the Obama Administration."" We looked to the analysis by EdSource, a nonprofit news organization that covers education, on this claim: ""The claim that Thurmond was reprimanded by the Obama administration is false. The letter from the Obama-era Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights criticizing West Contra Costa Unified’s handling of sexual harassment never mentions Thurmond or the district’s board. The letter was issued in 2013, after Thurmond left the board, though it does state the department’s investigation began during his term in 2010."" The letter was addressed to the superintendent of the school district. ""I was never reprimanded by Obama,"" Thurmond told EdSource, which also reported the ad prompted Thurmond’s campaign to send a cease and desist order to the committee that produced it. A spokeswoman for EdVoice pointed us to a website created by the independent expenditure group backing Tuck. It repeats the same claims in the TV ad and includes a link to the Obama-era letter. But it doesn’t offer any information that directly connects Thurmond to the reprimand. When we asked Thurmond’s campaign about the claim, it pointed to groups and individuals from the NAACP to U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris and San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who have all called out the ad. In a related fact check, we rated False the claim Thurmond was ""sued"" by the ACLU for leaving students in unsafe conditions. Our ruling A recent TV attack ad by a group supporting Marshall Tuck claimed the Obama administration ""reprimanded"" Tony Thurmond over assault and sexual harassment problems when he served on a school district board. Obama’s Education Department censured West Contra Costa Unified’s handling of sexual harassment during a period when Thurmond served on the district’s board. But the the report never mentions Thurmond and was addressed to the district’s superintendent.

Pipe bomb suspect's Florida voting records show only Republican affiliation
","False flag theories persist as the man suspected of sending explosives to critics of President Donald Trump faces federal charges. News reports have described the 56-year-old as a registered Republican. But bloggers peddling a narrative that suggests liberals are behind the pipe bomb plot argue that until recently, Sayoc belonged to the Democratic Party. ""A lifelong Democrat recently registered as a Republican, covered his van with Trump stickers and began sending bombs that didn’t explode to Democrats,"" reads a post that appeared on Facebook on Oct. 26. ""And you have to ask why Americans find that suspicious?"" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) According to the Florida Department of State, Sayoc registered with the Republican Party of Florida on March 4, 2016, less than two weeks before Trump won the Florida Republican presidential primary. But records from the Miami-Dade County Elections Department show that on two occasions in October 2012 — Oct. 9 and Oct. 26 — Sayoc initiated, but didn’t complete, new voter registration applications. Both times, he checked the box next to ""Republican Party"" as his party affiliation. On Oct. 9, 2012, he checked the box that said his was a ""new registration,"" but it appears he left blank the answer to a question about whether he’d ever been ""adjudicated mentally incapacitated with respect to voting."" On Oct. 26, 2012, he didn’t check any of the boxes indicating the reason behind his registration application (i.e. new registration, address change, name change, party change, etc.) Near the top of that form, someone scribbled, ""INCOMP,"" indicating it was incomplete. As provided to PolitiFact in response to a public records request, copies of both Sayoc’s 2012 applications show blank space in the section that asks for a Florida driver’s license, identification number or the last four digits of the applicant’s Social Security number. Florida election code states that if any of these pieces of information are not included in a voter registration application, the registration is considered incomplete. Sayoc’s application to vote remained incomplete until March 4, 2016, according to the department, when he provided his information in full, updated his mailing address and once again reported that his party affiliation was Republican. Also on the 2016 form, the box next to ""new registration"" is checked as the reason behind the application. The box next to ""party change"" is blank. Though Sayoc successfully registered to vote before Trump won the March 15 Florida presidential primary, his application still apparently came too late to be eligible to vote in that election. In Florida, the deadline to register in order to participate in an upcoming election is 29 days before the election. But Sayoc’s voting record seems to indicate that, after that, he was motivated to get his vote out: He went on to cast a ballot early three times — in the 2016 August primary, the 2016 general election and the August 2018 primary. Friends and other people who know Sayoc have said that he never showed an interest in politics until Trump came on the political scene, The Washington Post reported on Oct. 27. He started sharing pictures of himself at campaign events on Facebook. Ronald Lowy, a lawyer who represented Sayoc in a fraud case, told the paper Sayoc had ""no interest in politics… and along came the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, who welcomed all extremists, all outsiders, all outliers, and he felt that somebody was finally talking to him."" ""He registered as a Republican to vote in Florida — Lowy said he believes it was for the first time in Sayoc’s life — in 2016,"" the story says. An Oct 26 post on Facebook states that, ""A lifelong Democrat recently registered as a Republican, covered his van with Trump stickers and began sending bombs that didn’t explode to Democrats. And you have to ask why Americans find that suspicious?"" We found no evidence that Sayoc was a ""lifelong Democrat."" And while it’s true that state records show that Sayoc registered to vote relatively recently, in 2016, an application from 2012 shows that Sayoc then considered himself a member of the Republican Party.

Ad wrongly implies Marshall Tuck is ‘backed’ by Betsy DeVos
","An attack ad in the race to be California’s next schools chief strongly suggests candidate Marshall Tuck is ""backed"" by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, a polarizing Trump administration appointee. Tuck is a Democrat and former education executive. He’s running for State Superintendent of Public Instruction against State Asm. Tony Thurmond, also a Democrat, whose campaign produced the ad. The incumbent, Tom Torlakson, will be termed out in January after serving two four-year terms. Here’s what the ad claims, as a photo of President Trump standing next to DeVos appears on the screen and then zooms in on DeVos. ""Tuck is backed by Donald Trump’s education advisor and financed by the same billionaires behind Betsy DeVos.""  Ad by Tony Thurmond campaign Both Tuck and DeVos support charter schools. Meanwhile, Thurmond is a strong advocate for public schools. Tuck has said he supports nonprofit charter schools in areas with few quality public school alternatives, though he wants to implement some changes. According to his website, he wants to make for-profit charter schools illegal, require greater school transparency and open charter schools to all students. But we wanted to know whether DeVos really supports Tuck in the race, as the ad suggests. Our research DeVos’ office did not respond to our requests for comment. We asked Thurmond’s campaign about the claim. Instead of providing evidence that DeVos supports Tuck, they said he’s backed by Bill Evers. Evers is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution who specializes in education policy. He was also ""head of the ‘agency action team’ for the U.S. Department of Education in the Trump transition from early September 2016 through January 2017,"" according to his biography. In June, Evers posted a pro-Tuck campaign ad on Facebook and supported Tuck four years ago in his run for the same office. He’s not, however, on the long list of supporters on Tuck’s website. A spokesman for Tuck's campaign said Evers probably supports Tuck but hasn't made any financial contributions. Tuck's website includes a news article by the Independent Voter Network website that refers to Evers as a supporter of Tuck.  Evers did not respond to a request for comment.  Perhaps more importantly, the ad never mentions Evers’ name or shows his photo. Its primary focus is on DeVos. A spokesman for the Tuck campaign called the claim ""a false and misleading attack by Tony Thurmond."" He pointed to examples of Tuck criticizing DeVos. ""I’d rate Betsy DeVos extremely low. I think she is not qualified really for that job,"" Tuck said in a video posted in March by the news website gvwire.com. ""I’ve been very clear: My agenda is strongly against the Trump/DeVos agenda,"" he added at a campaign forum in May. Our ruling  State Asm. Tony Thurmond, a candidate for California schools chief, left the strong impression in a recent ad that his opponent, Marshall Tuck, ""is backed"" by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. The ad zooms in on a photo of DeVos as it says Tuck ""is backed by Donald Trump’s education advisor."" But Tuck has criticized DeVos and the Thurmond campaign offered no evidence she supports Tuck. They did say that Bill Evers, who advised Trump on education during his transition, supports Tuck. But he’s not mentioned by name or shown in the ad, and Tuck doesn’t list him as a supporter on his website. In the end, we agreed the ad is misleading. It gives the impression DeVos supports Tuck.

Fatal accident falsely used as evidence of murderous intent of border-crossers
","The danger posed by people coming across the United States-Mexican border is a common theme among people concerned about immigrants trying to enter the U.S. illegally.

Would Trump's own son be affected by an order eliminating birthright citizenship?
","President Donald Trump recently revealed plans to sign an executive order that would end birthright citizenship for babies born in the United States to parents who aren’t citizens. Does that put his own son at risk? ""Fun fact,"" starts a post that appeared on Facebook on Nov. 1. ""Barron Trump was born in March 2006 and Melania wasn’t a legal citizen until July 2006. So under this executive order, his own son wouldn’t be an American citizen."" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s start with Trump’s youngest child. Barron, who turned 12 on March 20, was indeed born in March 2006. His mother, Trump’s wife, Melania, is from Slovenia. She was working in New York as a model and dating Trump when she applied for a visa in 2000, according to the BBC. She secured a green card when her application was approved the following year. On March 20, 2006, she gave birth to Barron in New York  and she became a U.S. citizen four months later  in July 2006. The news about Trump targeting birthright citizenship was reported by Axios, which is airing an exclusive interview with the president today, Nov. 4. A story including excerpts of that conversation was published on Axios’ website on Oct. 30, and while the article discusses when Trump has the power to use an executive order, it doesn’t explain what, exactly, such an order would say in this case. On the campaign trail in 2015, Trump pitched a plan to end birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants. But we don’t yet know the details of a potential executive order to end birthright citizenship, including whether it would apply to children with one parent who is a citizen and another who isn’t. The 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees that ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and the state wherein they reside."" The amendment was ratified in 1868 and was intended to extend citizenship to former slaves who’d been recently freed following the Civil War. The amendment goes on to forbid states from denying anyone ""life, liberty or property, without due process of law"" or to ""deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" Barron Trump, who was born on U.S. soil, is a citizen of the United States both because of the 14th Amendment and regardless of it: Had he been born abroad, he would still be considered a citizen. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has a policy that a child born outside of the United States becomes a citizen at birth if at that time one parent is a foreign national and the other is a U.S. citizen who has been physically present in the country for at least five years, including at least two years after that person turned 14. Legal scholars and Trump critics have questioned whether Trump has unilateral authority to make an executive order that would be in direct contrast with the 14th Amendment. Wrote Corey Brettschneider, a professor of political science at Brown University, in a Nov. 3 piece for The Guardian, ""An executive order cannot reverse the guarantee of citizenship to anyone born in the United States that is enshrined in the constitution…Contrary to Trump’s assertion, the constitution’s text and values and Supreme Court decisions show he cannot unilaterally revoke birthright citizenship. Nor can Congress pass a law to do so. The idea is enshrined in the constitution and can only be changed with a formal amendment."" In order for a constitutional amendment to be approved, it must be proposed by a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate. It would then need to be ratified by three-fourths of the states. Vice President Mike Pence stated in an Oct. 30 interview with Slate that Trump is looking at citizenship law broadly and suggested that the matter might need to go before the nation’s highest court: ""We all cherish the language of the 14th Amendment, but the Supreme Court of the United States has never ruled on whether or not the language of the 14th Amendment subject to the jurisdiction thereof applies specifically to people who are in the country illegally,"" Pence said. House Speaker Paul Ryan, meanwhile, has dismissed the idea that Trump could end birthright citizenship with an executive order: ""I’m a believer in following the plain text of the constitution, and I think in this case the 14th Amendment is pretty clear,"" Ryan said on Oct. 30, ""and that would involve a very, very lengthy constitutional process."" A Facebook post says that ""under an executive order"" by President Trump to revoke birthright citizenship, Trump’s son Barron ""wouldn’t be an American citizen."" We don’t yet know either the details, scope or effect of the executive order Trump is planning. But we do know that the 14th Amendment guarantees Barron Trump citizenship. And we do know that even if Barron Trump had been born elsewhere, he would be a U.S. citizen because his father is a U.S. citizen who had been physically present in the U.S. for five years prior to Barron’s birth. Scholars suggest that it would take far more than an executive order to undo birthright citizenship. It is likely that any executive order that attempts to do so would encounter legal challenges. As PolitiFact’s own reporter Louis Jacobson wrote on Oct. 30, ""The most that Trump could do is sign such an executive order with the clear expectation that opponents would sue to block its implementation. After that, it would be up to the courts to decide the ultimate outcome."" We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2018/nov/04/blog-posting/would-trumps-own-son-be-affected-order-eliminating/
"['Immigration', 'Missouri', 'Senate Leadership Fund']","
McCaskill voted for path to citizenship, but it's a stretch to call it amnesty
","Immigration policy is one of the thorniest issues of the 2018 midterm election cycle. Just ask incumbent U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. She’s running against Missouri’s Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley in one of the nation’s most high-profile races. An ad released by the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican-backed political action committee, questions her voting record on immigration. ""In Missouri, Claire McCaskill said she was against amnesty for illegal immigrants. In Washington, McCaskill joined the liberals for giving amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants without border protections in place,"" the ad said. We’ve fact-checked some of the Senate Leadership Fund’s other ads, as well as various politicians’ statements pertaining to McCaskill’s immigration voting record. We wanted to see if there was truth to the ad’s claim that McCaskill voted along party lines to grant amnesty 11 million undocumented immigrants . The Senate Leadership Fund did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment or clarification. However, the ad included a small caption referencing McCaskill’s voting record, noting McCaskill’s vote in favor of the 2013 Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744). It would have provided some of the undocumented immigrants living in America a pathway to citizenship which would have taken at least 13 years. At the time, the so-called ""gang of eight,"" a coalition of four Republican and four Democratic senators, touted the bill as a sweeping fix for the country’s flawed immigration system. The bill proposed the following steps to citizenship: The bill would have also allocated $46.3 billion in border security, doubled the number of border agents, imposed fines on immigrants seeking citizenship and created a merit-based visa category, among other measures. It passed the Senate 68-32, but died in the House. Although the bill would have laid out a path to citizenship, the experts we talked to said it was a stretch to call it amnesty as the Senate Leadership Fund did. ""I do think this is a type of amnesty, but I would hesitate before using amnesty in our current political environment because it has been so heavily criticized,"" said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. ""Amnesty tends to indicate that you’re talking about giving someone a benefit that they don’t deserve,"" Pierce said. Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, agreed. ""The whole point of the Senate bill was to create a whole series of hurdles that people who were here without status would have to jump through, including background checks, paying significant fines, waiting long periods of times,"" he said. ""It was all linked to securing the border."" Alden noted that critics of the 2013 bill might liken it to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The 1986 bill, signed into law by Republican President Ronald Reagan, gave the approximately 3 million unauthorized immigrants who had arrived in the country prior to Jan. 1, 1982, a chance to apply for citizenship. As a result of its passage, 2.7 million people obtained permanent residency status, according to a report from the Migration Policy Institute. ""(Senate bill 744) was also closely tied to meeting border security benchmarks, whereas the  Immigration Reform and Control Act legalization had no strings attached,"" Alden said in an email. Unlike the bill McCaskill voted for five years ago, Alden said the Reagan-era law did not ""prevent people from coming illegally in the future or from working in the United States even if they didn’t have status."" ""To conflate this with the amnesty President Reagan signed is a misreading of what (the 2013 bill) contained,"" Alden said. As for the Senate Leadership Fund’s claim that 11 million people would have benefitted from the bill’s pathway to citizenship, experts agreed that’s also a stretch. ""Not everyone would have been able to meet those requirements and pay those fees (to get citizenship),"" said Kate Voigt, associate director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Voigt said the lengthy process combined with strict background check requirements would have prevented all from qualifying. In 2013, McCaskill voted for a bill that would have given undocumented immigrants living in the country a path, albeit a long one, to citizenship. The Senate Leadership Fund’s claim that she joined ""the liberals"" in supporting a bill that would have given ""amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants"" is deceptive for three reasons: First, the bill was branded as a bipartisan solution to immigration reform and co-sponsored by four Republican and four Democratic senators. Second, the bill included numerous hurdles unauthorized immigrants would have had to overcome, including fines and background checks, before becoming eligible for full citizenship. Experts say it is a loose interpretation of blanket residency. Lastly, in 2013 there were approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, but given the exclusions and restrictions included in the 2013 bill, not all of them would have qualified to start the citizenship process under the Senate bill’s guidelines. For those reasons we rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/nov/04/senate-leadership-fund/mccaskill-voted-path-citizenship-its-stretch-call-/

""I’m deeply appreciative of law enforcement's quick response to the shooting at the yoga facility in Tallahassee today. No act of gun violence is acceptable.

This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The blog post does little to justify its misleading headline and lead paragraph. The Grio article doesn’t cite any source for Gillum’s announcement to suspend his campaign ""indefinitely,"" but does outline what took place during Friday’s shooting where Scott Paul Beierle killed two people and wounded five in a yoga studio in Tallahassee before killing himself, according to the Guardian. The Grio post notes that the gunman ""reportedly had a history of arrests for grabbing women,"" and links to a USA Today article published Nov. 3 that digs into Beierle’s background. Emails sent to The Grio Saturday all bounced back. An email sent to the author of the article and messages sent to Gillum’s campaign were not immediately returned. Gillum’s tweet from Friday is quoted in the article, along with remarks the Tallahassee Democrat reported he made near where the shooting occurred. The Grio’s post is similar to the Nov. 2 New York Daily News article with the headline, ""Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum suspends campaign after 2 dead in Tallahassee shooting."" The Guardian wrote in its Nov. 3 article that Gillum ""tweeted that he was leaving the campaign trail to return to Tallahassee."" However, there’s no evidence that Gillum is ""indefinitely suspending his campaign for governor"" following Friday’s shooting like The Grio’s post claims. In fact, Gillum is still campaigning. On Saturday afternoon, Palm Beach Post political reporter George Bennett tweeted photos of Gillum at a Jimmy Buffett concert being held to garner support for Gillum and Sen. Bill Nelson. The concert in West Palm Beach was being held ""to rally voters before Election Day on Tuesday,"" according to a Nov. 1 Miami Herald article announcing the concert. Bennett tweeted pictures of Gillum with Norman Lear and Nelson, noting that both Gillum and Nelson ""went with the khaki/blue shirt combo"" for the rally.

Republican says Democrats cut billions from Medicare, but leaves some info out
","Health care is a hot-button issue this election season. Candidates have thrown around quite a few numbers while accusing their opponents of either supporting or opposing some key health-care legislation. In a closely fought campaign for North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, Republican Mark Harris is following suit after his Democratic opponent, Dan McCready, accused Harris of wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare. We recently checked McCready’s claim and found it to be Half True. Harris has not supported any plans that would immediately cut these two programs, but has expressed that he wants an ""overhaul"" of Social Security. A Facebook ad, paid for by Harris, addresses this claim directly. ""My opponent attacks me, alleging I want to cut Social Security and Medicare, when it was the liberal Democrats who back his campaign that cut $716 BILLION from Medicare to fund their healthcare scheme: Obamacare,"" the ad said. The ad has been running since Oct. 22, 2018. We are specifically checking if $716 billion was ""cut"" from Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health law passed in 2010. It. This is a claim PolitiFact has checked numerous times. Politicians have been using the $716 billion number since at least 2012. Old claim and old number In 2012, PolitiFact checked a similar claim from presidential candidate Mitt Romney and rated it Half True. Paul Ryan, Romney’s vice presidential pick in 2012 and now the speaker of the House, made a similar claim that year that got him a Mostly False rating. Finally, a 2015 claim by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was rated Half True. And there are many more. Politicians often were using the right number but the wrong context. Asked where Harris’s $716 billion figure comes from, Jason Williams, his campaign manager, shared a link of a Washington Post blog post from 2012. The article says Mitt Romney, former Republican presidential candidate, is right in saying Obamacare cuts the Medicare budget by $716 billion. And while there was a cut in spending, there was never a loss of services or a decrease in quality of services. But that article is more than six years old, and so are the government numbers it relies upon. So let’s take a fresh look. Harris’s claim makes it sound like the ACA cut benefits for the elderly. Matthew Fiedler from the Brookings Institution, a center-left think tank, says there isn’t any evidence of that. ""The implication when this claim was made is that these harmed Medicare beneficiaries. That implication is not accurate. These were changes that reduced what physicians and hospitals received from Medicare,"" Fiedler said. The ACA aimed in part to bring down the future growth of costs in Medicare, offsetting some of the cost of the law. An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, from 2011, says the health-care legislation would ""permanently reduce the growth of Medicare’s payment rates for most services."" ""You might suggest maybe that reductions in payments may have reduced the quality in care. I don’t think there is a whole lot of evidence of that,"" Fiedler said. ""Various other changes were aimed at giving hospitals and physicians incentives to provide better care."" Fiedler said that prior to the ACA, people were paying more for medical services than they needed to in order to cover the costs. After the ACA, premiums and co-payments went down, saving Medicare beneficiaries money. The $716 billion figure was an estimate of how much would be saved. But that was a projection, and while Obamacare has been in effect for years, PolitiFact wasn’t able to find a recent estimate of what happened in reality. Any repeal or replacement bill that has passed through Congress actually included these same provisions, even Republican plans, according to Tricia Neuman, the senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care policy organization. ""Subsequent proposals to repeal the ACA retained those Medicare savings. It’s sort of having it both ways for criticising ACA savings, but keeping them in subsequent proposals,"" Neuman said of Republicans. Neuman also said that the ACA improved drug coverage and preventative services for Medicare beneficiaries. Harris’s number would’ve been closer to the truth if this was 2012 and not 2018. However, his use of the number also gives a false impression. The number actually represented a projection of how much federal money Obamacare would save over the years, mainly at the expense of insurers, medical providers and hospitals. We rate this claim Mostly False. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

Did Texas U.S. Rep. John Culberson use campaign money for fossils and collectibles?
","As the 2018 campaign comes to a close, the political arm of the Environmental Defense Fund has sent a mailer to homes in Texas’ 7th Congressional District saying that John Culberson, a Republican congressman, is ""wrong for Houston."" As partial proof, it said he was ""caught using campaign cash on collectibles, including Civil War memorabilia and fossils."" ""Caught"" is an interesting word, since the nine-term incumbent, now challenged by Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, disclosed the memorabilia purchases, which he says he gave as gifts from his campaign. As for the fossils, his campaign insisted there were no such purchases -- and said it only bought books and maps from a business that happens to also sell fossils. Critics have made a false assumption, the Culberson campaign told us initially. We’ll look at both parts of the claim but will give away a bit of what we found right here: He bought fossil replicas. If you wonder why an environment group would care about fossils and Culberson, the group noted that Culberson said in late summer that his purchases were for research into such things as paleoclimatology, or the study of climates before instrumental records were widely available, to help him better understand climate change. Environmental Defense Fund Action says that for all this studying, Culberson still refuses to accept scientific research on the matter. Culberson has said humans played a role in climate change but, as he told the Los Angeles Times in 2015,  ""We just don’t have enough data or accurate data to say with certainty what that effect has been."" Let’s take fossils first. The congressman’s critics based their claim on a mention in a 2012 campaign finance report that Culberson’s campaign made two purchases from a South Dakota organization, the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research. The institute sells fossils, replicas and other things, and Culberson spent $309.66 altogether there, Federal Election Commission records show. The purchase was part of a broader set of Culberson expenses being questioned by Texas Democrats -- a set of questions we are not addressing fully here because we are looking specifically at campaign ads and claims. But for a bit of perspective, the Houston Chronicle wrote in August that Texas Democrats were challenging nearly $50,000 in Culberson campaign spending since 2004. Focusing just on fossils, PolitiFact asked Culberson’s campaign what it bought from the Black Hills Institute. We were told it bought books and maps, not fossils, the same explanation the campaign has given since August. ""Only in politics does a person get attacked for trying to be better at their job,"" Culberson campaign spokeswoman Catherine Kelly said. ""The mailer from the Environmental Defense Action Fund is factually wrong. The congressman never bought fossils with campaign contributions and all other purchases are acceptable under House and FEC rules."" Culberson is a voracious reader, and has spent thousands of dollars from his campaign account for books and materials, including some on paleoclimatology, that his campaign says were related to his job. In just the 2011-12 campaign season, Culbserson’s campaign spent $9,848 on ""research"" or ""research materials,"" most of it from vendors such as Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble, FEC records reviewed by PolitiFact show. Culberson chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees spending on science and such agencies as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The research material helps him better understand the changing levels of carbon dioxide in the climate, his campaign says. Asked about records that would show he was buying books and maps, not fossils, from the Black Hills Institute, his campaign said the 2012 records for such specific purchases no longer exist. PolitFact, however, called the Black Hills Institute. They pulled the invoices from Culberson's two separate orders and sent us copies. This is what the campaign paid for, excluding shipping charges: Three large wall charts showing extensive histories of the Earth and matter, dating back 4.5 billion years. The charts have columns showing tectonic maps, changes in the earth such as mountain formation, major volcanic eruptions, glacial epochs, craters from asteroids and comets and extensive information on fossils, invertebrates and vertebrate lifeforms, as well as their extinction. These cost $19.95 apiece. One desktop model of a Triceratops. It cost $84.05. Two large -- 4.5 inches -- fossil replicas of a Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth. Each cost $40. The FEC gives ""pretty wide latitude"" to the purchase of books and other materials that a candidate or officeholder might use in his or her official capacity, Brendan Fischer, an expert on campaign finance law at the Campaign Legal Center, told us. But what about a Triceratops model and replicas of a Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth fossil? ""I’d like to hear their explanation for it,"" he said. ""It’s hard to see how it would pertain to their official duties."" We told the campaign what we found, and it asked what our proof was. So we sent the campaign the invoices for the congressman’s purchases. The response from Kelly, the spokeswoman: ""The invoices confirm that the congressman never bought actual fossils, and every purchase from the Black Hills Institute is considered acceptable under House and FEC rules."" Asked why the congressman bought the replicas and the model at all, Kelly said, ""While these purchases were more than six years ago and now being used as part of a coordinated partisan hit job, the congressman believes these particular purchases were gifts, which is completely acceptable under FEC and House rules."" The mailer from Environmental Defense Fund Action also mentioned Culberson’s use of campaign money to buy collectibles and Civil War memorabilia. This, too, originated from the Democrats’ complaint referenced in the Houston Chronicle. Culberson is a Civil War history buff, collector and sometime-seller of memorabilia. But when it comes to his campaign funds, the purchases were for items such as stamps and coins the congressman got in order to give out as gifts, his campaign said. Congress members frequently use campaign money to buy gifts for constituents and volunteers, and the Culberson campaign said the Texas Republican was doing nothing different from what House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has done when buying white orchids. The FEC allows candidates and officeholders to buy and give as gifts items of nominal value as long as they are not given to family members, Fischer said. FEC reports show only what a candidate or officeholder pays, not the value of the each item. For example, in 2014, Culberson’s campaign spent $3,631 on coins from an antique coin seller. In 2009 and 2010, the campaign spent $4,181 on antiques and coins for gifts, including hat stars  (an emblem worn on soldiers’ hats) and Texas Centennial and Republic of Texas coins, FEC records show. Culberson’s campaign said the value of each coin was about $25, and the value of stamps was about $10. For a broader view, we downloaded FEC data showing all federal candidate purchases -- those for everyone with a federal campaign account -- of items listed as ""gifts"" just since January 2017. The total reached $1.8 million, for everything from model airplanes to a quilt to gift baskets. Environmental Defense Fund Action said Texas U.S. Rep. John Culberson ""was caught using campaign cash on collectibles, including Civil War memorabilia and fossils."" ""Caught"" seemed strong to us at first, given the campaign’s denials. But with a phone call and email, it turned out that Culberson had in fact used campaign funds -- not for fossils, but for replicas and a desktop model. Our ruling comes down to perspective. The mailer’s spin seemed a little strong at first, especially knowing that gift purchases, whether for Civil War trinkets or not, are allowable if considered of nominal value. But the insistence of the campaign that Culberson did not buy fossils -- and that he had only bought books and maps -- is a factor as well. OK, he didn’t buy fossils. He bought fossil replicas. We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/nov/03/environmental-defense-fund-action/did-texas-us-rep-john-culberson-use-campaign-money/

","One of Donald Trump's campaign pledges was to improve healthcare for veterans. The problem has long been recognized, although we rated Trump's claim that thousands of veterans were dying because they couldn't get treatment fast enough as Half True. Now a meme is making the rounds on Facebook, shared more than 187,000 times, accusing the Democrats of trying to thwart improvements to medical care through the Veterans Affairs system. ""I urge all veterans to vote Republican this November because the damn Democrats blocked the VA healthcare bill again,"" James Hauser asserts in an all-caps message posted Oct. 4. This meme was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We sent a Facebook message to Hauser asking for specifics, but didn't hear back. In fact, legislation to improve the system passed Congress last spring with bipartisan support, contrary to the meme's assertion. In May, the U.S. Senate gave final passage to a major overall of the health care system and sent it to Trump for his signature. The measure, S-2372 known as the VA MISSION Act, was designed to make it easier for veterans to get care from private physicians who are not in the VA system and, in theory, speed the delivery of care. It passed the House 347 to 70 on May 16, 2018. Democrats made up 116 of those 347 winning votes. All of the opponents were Democrats. It passed the Senate 92 to 5 on May 23, 2018. Democrats made nearly half the winning votes. The ""Nay"" votes were cast by two Democrats, two Republicans and one Independent. In short, precisely two thirds of the Democrats in Congress voted for the bill. To make the claim that ""Democrats blocked the VA healthcare bill"" strikes us a meme malpractice. We rate that claim Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2018/nov/03/blog-posting/facebook-meme-miscounts-votes-claim-democrats-bloc/

No, Yellowstone volcano's eruption threat level did not increase in 2018
","Amid partisan allegations of political disasters, should we be more worried about the natural variety—and cancel any upcoming vacations to the first national park in the United States? ""Yellowstone super volcano threat level just increased to ‘high’ by USGS,"" warned the headline on a story posted with a ""preppers"" tag on Oct. 29 on Disclose.tv. (USGS is th acronym for the U.S. Geological Survey, which provides science about natural hazards.) The Disclose.tv website lets users submit and share topics and videos that are supposedly ignored, denied or inadequately covered ""by the mainstream media, governmental institutions and other information keepers."" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Disclose.tv said in an email to PolitiFact that 100 percent of its content is user-generated. But at some point before we reached out, the headline was changed to read, ""Yellowstone super volcano threat level set to ‘high’ by USGS,"" and it said it was posted to ""nature,"" not ""preppers.""   The Epoch Times, which posted a story on Oct. 25 about an eruption threat, also updated its coverage, but with a correction. ""The Epoch Times published a misleading headline declaring the threat of Yellowstone volcano eruption had increased to ‘high.’ Yellowstone volcano’s ranking of 21st on the U.S. Geological Survey’s assessment has not changed."" Yet another publication, the Post Register in Idaho, reported that the threat had been bumped from ""moderate"" to ""high,"" though the newspaper cautioned that the Yellowstone caldera isn’t expected to ""explode in a mega eruption anytime soon."" Perhaps anticipating—or responding to—confusion over the volano’s threat assessment, USGS published its own article on Oct. 29 that explains what it all means. Here are the facts: Earlier this month, the agency released an updated threat assessment for U.S. volcanoes for the first time since the original assessment was published in 2005. The new assessment accounts for new research and observations over the past 13 years. In the 2005 assessment, Yellowstone is listed as a ""high threat"" volcano. In the 2018 assessment, Yellowstone is listed as a ""high threat"" volcano. Each volcano also has an overall threat score, which considers factors including average recurrence of eruptions, what types of eruptions have taken place and nearby infrastructure. In 2005, Yellowstone was ranked 21. In 2018, Yellowstone was ranked 21. ""This qualifies Yellowstone as a ‘high threat’ volcanic system,"" according to the USGS article. ""This is not a change or any sort of upgrade in the threat posed by Yellowstone, and carries no implications for future eruptive activity. It is merely a way to provide a sense of Yellowstone’s threat level compared to other volcanoes in the USA."" It’s also important to note that the assessment is not an indicator of which volcanoes are most likely to erupt, according to USGS. It’s also not a ranking of the most active volcanoes (and ""active"" means that a volcano has erupted in the past 11,650 years). Rather, assessments gauge the relative risk a volcano poses to people and property. So if a volcano erupts but no one is living on it, it has a very low threat because no people or property are at risk, according to USGS. Meanwhile, ""a volcano that might experience only small explosions but that is surrounded by towns and near an airport has a higher threat, since lots of people and property are exposed to the hazard (even if the hazard might be a relatively small one.)"" We’ll let Michael Poland, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey and scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, have the last word. ""In a nutshell, this whole ‘bumped Yellowstone’s volcano threat to high’ thing is a massive job of misreporting,"" Poland said in an email. ""The threat level for the caldera system is rated as ‘high’ in a report that was issued by USGS. That report updates an initial report from 2005, in which Yellowstone was also rated ‘high.’ ... Nothing has changed"" We rate this statement False.",/factchecks/2018/nov/03/blog-posting/no-yellowstone-volcanos-eruption-threat-level-did-/

Tony Evers' claim against Scott Walker on student health care flatlines
","In a final push before the Nov. 6, 2018 election, Democrat Tony Evers levied a new claim against Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s health care policy. Health insurance has been a key issue throughout the campaign — Walker wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and Wisconsin is suing in federal court in Texas to try to make that happen. Meanwhile, Walker offered a last-minute proposal on pre-existing conditions, saying he would codify into state law the same protections offered by the ACA. Speaking Nov. 1, 2018, in Eau Claire, Evers reiterated that he would protect Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions, then pivoted to new anti-Walker claim. ""How many students here are still under their parents' health care (insurance)? There’s more than a handful,"" Evers said, then added: ""He wants to get rid of that, too."" Does Walker really want to force students off their parents’ health insurance? Evers offers no specific evidence Asked for back up for the claim, Evers spokesman Sam Lau pointed only to Walker’s opposition to the ACA, commonly called Obamacare. ""The Affordable Care Act allows you to stay on your parents’ health care until you are 26, and Walker is suing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act,"" Lau said. True enough. The Affordable Care Act does require that insurers offering dependent child coverage make that coverage available until the child turns 26. But Wisconsin law also has a similar – though less comprehensive – requirement that would remain in place even if the ACA is repealed. The provision was put into place as part of the 2011-’13 budget, based on wording added by the Joint Finance Committee to comply with ACA requirements. The Wisconsin language would not apply to employer-sponsored insurance that is self-funded — about half the employer plans in the state. That exemption, which is part of federal law, means half the employer plans wouldn’t be required to cover children up to age 26, said Jon Peacock, research director for Kids Forward, a Madison-based advocacy group. Nevertheless, Walker has already signed a provision that does what Evers says Walker opposes -- provides the ability for ""kids"" to be on the health plans of their parents.  What's more, past statements from Walker have gone further. And Walker campaign spokesman Ben Voelkel said the governor continues to support leaving the provision as it is in the ACA. He cited several articles, including an Aug. 18, 2015 one from the website Becker’s Hospital Review. That article, in the midst of Walker’s brief presidential campaign, looked at key points from Walker’s plan to replace the ACA. Among the points noted: ""Under his proposal, Americans would not be fined for not having health insurance and those under 26 years old can stay on their parents' plans."" He also noted a 2017 Washington Post interview, in which Walker identified coverage ""for young people"" as among the things he’d keep from the Affordable Care Act if he were creating new policy after a repeal. Our rating Evers says Walker ""wants to get rid of"" students’ ability to stay on their parents’ health insurance. But Evers offers no direct evidence of that claim. The only evidence offered — that Walker opposes the ACA, which also includes coverage through age 26 — does not logically connect. It’s not reasonable to extrapolate from Walker’s opposition of the ACA that he opposes each and every individual policy position within it. And the claim ignores the fact that Walker has already signed into law a requirement that health insurers in Wisconsin allow young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance until age 26. We rate Evers’ claim False. Editor's note: This item was updated on Nov. 5, 2018 to reflect information from Joe Peacock of the Kids Forward about how the provision in state law compares to the ACA. The rating remains False.",/factchecks/2018/nov/02/tony-evers/tony-evers-claim-against-scott-walker-student-heal/

Voting will not cost you your hunting license in North Dakota
","The North Dakota Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party is running a Facebook ad in North Dakota that claims your hunting license is at risk. It’s not. ""Attention hunters: Voting in North Dakota could cost you your out-of-state hunting licenses,"" says the Facebook ad, which began running on Nov. 1. We ran the ad by Cameron Wimpy, research director at MIT Election Data and Science Lab. ""I do absolutely think it is voter suppression to try and trick folks this way,"" Wimpy said. Most North Dakota hunters can breathe easy. If you have an out-of-state hunting license anywhere outside of North Dakota -- and it’s an out-of-state license, rather than a residential one for residents of that state -- you’re safe. If you have a North Dakota residential hunting license, you’re also safe, because in applying for that license you already gave up any other residential licenses. North Dakota’s Game and Fish department doesn’t allow a person to hold two residential licenses. (Those tend to expire within a season or year anyway.) In theory, this applies to folks living in North Dakota who have a residential license in a state other than North Dakota, which conceivably could be people who have just moved. (This is the basis on which the North Dakota Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party, which is the state’s branch of the Democratic Party, defended the ad.)  Would casting a vote in North Dakota make even those licenses void? We found no evidence of that. We called the Fish and Wildlife offices in North Dakota’s neighboring states: Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota and Minnesota. They all told us that voting in North Dakota wouldn’t make them lose their licenses. ""If they purchased that license prior to leaving Montana as legal resident, it is valid until the expiration date, no matter what they do in North Dakota,"" said Ron Jendro, the assistant chief of enforcement for the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department. The same goes for Wyoming, South Dakota and Minnesota; the licenses are valid until they expire. For other states, establishing residency elsewhere means their resident hunting license is void. That’s the case in North Dakota and Kentucky, the two other states whose hunting permit offices we called. But there’s no way that casting a vote would suddenly make those licenses null. Lee Ann Oliver, elections specialist at the North Dakota Secretary of State’s office, told us they have a central voter file, but fish and wildlife departments don’t get access to that database. And anyway, in order to vote, a person has to already have established residency. ""They’re putting the cart before the horse,"" Oliver said. ""You have to be a resident before you can vote."" Voters can show a North Dakota driver’s license, nondriver’s identification card, tribal ID or long term care card. If those don’t include a current North Dakota residential address or date of birth, the voter may supplement their ID with a variety of documents, like bills or bank statements. North Dakota Democratic-NPL said, ""Attention hunters: Voting in North Dakota could cost you your out-of-state hunting licenses."" It’s hard to interpret this in any way except that it seeks to discourage people from voting. But voting will not cost anyone their hunting licenses. People with out-of-state hunting licenses get to keep their licenses; the warning only applies to people with residential licenses in another state who recently moved to North Dakota. Voting would not make those null, but establishing residency in another state, which is a prerequisite to voting, might, depending on the state. The ad employs a ridiculous argument.
