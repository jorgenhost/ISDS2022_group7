Fake column spreads unfounded claims
","Add this one to the many ways chain e-mails are spreading false information in the campaign: bogus columns.
 
A new chain e-mail, echoed by dozens of blog postings, claims to have a column from

New York Times

columnist Maureen Dowd that criticizes Sen. Barack Obama for accepting suspicious contributions from Iran, Saudi Arabia and China.
 
It has Dowd's byline and a headline that says ""OBAMA'S TROUBLING INTERNET FUND RAISING."" Some versions of the e-mail even have Dowd's picture.
 
The column, which is dated June 29, 2008, says Dowd got a call from ""one of the Obama's
campaign [sic] internet geeks"" who told her the campaign has received a flood of small contributions from overseas. The contributors were difficult to trace, the column says, but they came from a small number of banks and credit cards in various countries, particularly from ""Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other Middle Eastern countries.""
 
The column says that ""another concentrated group of donations was traced to a Chinese ISP (Internet provider) with a similar pattern of limited credit card charges.""
 
The column says campaign officials were aware ""these donations were very likely coming from sources
other than American voters,"" but they concluded it was legal to accept them. Federal law prohibits foreign nationals from contributing to the presidential campaigns, but donations from Americans living overseas are legal and fairly common.
 
The column calls the decision to accept them ""a shocking revelation"" and says the Obama campaign should be audited. (You can find the full text of the e-mail

here

.)
 
The column is a fake. Dowd told us she did not write it and that ""It just seems like anyone who is familiar with my column would know this wasn't me.""
 
For more detail on how the e-mail spread, see our story

Bogus Dowd column spreads quickly.

 
It's not clear who wrote the column. One of the early appearances of the column was when it was posted June 29, 2008, on a blog on AZCentral, the

Arizona Republic

newspaper site, by someone identified as Thomas Moore. In his bio, he describes himself as ""a retired journalist/technical writer/illustrator"" and a fan of Barry Goldwater. His photo on the blog is a computer animation of a man waving a McCain sign, although Moore has no apparent ties to the McCain campaign.
 
When someone pointed out on his blog that the column was a fake, Moore wrote, ""It appears that I may be the fool for posting the editorial, since I don't find it on the NYT Website, either. I'm checking with the friend who sent it to me, as to whether he copied it directly from the Website.""
 
But Moore then mused that it still might be accurate and that the

New York Times

might have pulled the column from the Web site because the newspaper feared a lawsuit.
 
Moore could not be reached for comment. A posting on his blog from Monday said he was departing for a long sailing vacation.
 
""I should return in September,"" he wrote, ""so in my absence please torment the liberals just as if I were here.""
 
The Obama campaign says it follows federal law and does not accept donations from foreign citizens. Donors must certify that ""I am a United States citizen or a lawfully-admitted permanent resident.""
 
Because the column is fake and provides no factual evidence to back up its assertion about foreign contributions, we don't consider there is enough evidence to address the allegation here. The issue for the Truth-O-Meter is whether Dowd wrote the column. She didn't, which makes the claim False.

No consensus on Iran's nuke program
","Sen. John McCain ratcheted up his rhetoric against Iran in a recent campaign appearance, alleging that ""every objective observer"" believes the country is pursuing nuclear weapons.
 
It's an incendiary accusation – maybe even a case for war. But is it true?
 
No. In fact, the U.S. intelligence community said in its latest

National Intelligence Estimate

that ""in fall 2003, Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program.""
 
The estimate cautioned that Iran was ""keeping open the option"" to develop nuclear weapons. And the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a United Nations affiliate, said in May it has ""serious concern"" about Iran's lack of transparency with respect to its nuclear program.
 
But both of those sources – and plenty of other objective observers – have said there is no proof Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons.
 
McCain's comments came during a


June 24 telephone town hall meeting
with South Florida voters.
 
""Just one other issue I want to talk about of course is Iran/Israel,"" McCain said. ""The Iranians continue – in the view of every objective observer – to continue to pursue the acquisition of nuclear weapons. It would destabilize the Middle East.""
 
Under the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, a global accord, the country is permitted to seek nuclear power but not nuclear weapons. Iran acknowledges it is enriching uranium, the most difficult task on the path to manufacturing a nuclear weapon. But the nation's leaders steadfastly

maintain

that they want the uranium to power reactors for nuclear energy, not to arm nuclear weapons. They say the country's supreme leader forbade the pursuit of nuclear weapons in a 2005 fatwa, or religious edict.
 
""The Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has issued the fatwa that the production, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons are forbidden under Islam and that the Islamic Republic of Iran shall never acquire these weapons,"" the country told the IAEA in a

2005 statement

. Iran's leaders regularly repeat such denials.
 
In defending McCain's claim, his spokesman Brian Rogers pointed out that among those who have expressed concerns about Iran's nuclear program are the IAEA, the U.N. Security Council, former U.N. weapons inspector David Albright, nonpartisan think tanks and even Sen. Barack Obama.
 
""It is on this basis that Senator McCain believes Iran continues to pursue nuclear weapons,"" Rogers said in an e-mail.
 
It is true that there is widespread concern in the international community about Iran's intentions. Once Iran has enriched uranium into nuclear fuel – a technological Holy Grail the country has pursued furiously and claims to have mastered – it could, without much further difficulty, make highly enriched uranium. Once it has accomplished that, it could fairly easily make a nuclear bomb.
 
The IAEA

declared

in 2005 that Iran's history of concealing nuclear activities constituted a breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The agency said ""good progress has been made in Iran's correction of the breaches,"" but there was an ""absence of confidence that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes.""
 
The IAEA has inspected the country's nuclear facilities unannounced at least 14 times in the past 15 months to try to verify that Iran is pursuing only nuclear energy, not weapons. In a May 26

report

, it leveled a series of strong criticisms against Iran. It said Iran had not yet provided access to some uranium mines and research facilities the IAEA wanted to see. The IAEA said it had ""serious concern"" about studies Iran allegedly conducted in years past on high-explosives testing, missile design and a type of uranium called green salt. It said it wanted more information on a 1987 document on uranium metal – potentially a component of a nuclear bomb – that Iran said it received unsolicited from Pakistan years ago. And the IAEA said it had questions about the work of several military-related institutes, defense companies and scientists in Iran.
 
""At this stage, Iran has not provided the agency with all the information, access to documents and access to individuals necessary to support Iran's statements,"" about the peaceful nature of its nuclear program, the IAEA said.
 
But most of the questions the agency raised had to do with alleged activities that took place before 2003, when U.S. intelligence agencies said Iran halted its pursuit of nuclear weapons. And the IAEA reported that it ""has been able to continue to verify the nondiversion of declared nuclear material (to military programs) in Iran."" It said it had all the nuclear material it knows about in Iran under ""containment and surveillance.""
 
The agency said that apart from the uranium metal document, it had ""no information ... on the actual design or manufacture by Iran of nuclear material components of a nuclear weapon or of certain other key components, such as initiators, or on related nuclear physics studies.""
 
Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the IAEA, has maintained that stance for months.
 
""What we have seen in the past (is) that certain procurements that have not been reported to us, certain experiments,"" ElBaradei told CNN in October 2007. ""And that's where we are working now with Iran to clarify the past and the present. But I have not received any information that there is a complete active nuclear weapon program going on right now.""
 
Indeed, when U.S. intelligence agencies summarized their findings in last year's National Intelligence Estimate, they said Iran was believed to have had a nuclear weapons program in years past – despite its claims to the contrary – but that it halted the program in 2003 ""in response to international pressure.""
 
Suzanne Maloney, a former policy adviser on Iran in the Bush administration through last year and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Iran's ongoing enrichment program ""has a military dimension to it,"" since it would give the country the capability to produce a nuclear bomb. But, she conceded, McCain's statement ""shades the legitimate gray area that exists about what Iran is doing now.""
 
Steven Aftergood, project director at the Federation of American Scientists, concurred.
 
""There are different ways to lay out the facts and to state them more or less provocatively,"" Aftergood said. ""But I don't think there is a basis to state categorically that they are pursuing nuclear weapons.""
 
So there are ""objective observers,"" including some in the U.S. intelligence community, who are not convinced Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons. Surely McCain knew that when he said otherwise. Of course, we aren't able to answer the underlying question of whether Iran is seeking nuclear weapons, as McCain believes. We only can examine the part of his statement where McCain claims there is a consensus among ""objective observers"" in support of his belief.
 
And on that, the evidence is clear: McCain is wrong. The facts say False.

RNC ad right on drilling and taxes, wrong on other points
","A new TV ad from the Republican National Committee picks up where the McCain campaign's James Bond ad left off, portraying Sen. Barack Obama as an opponent of lower gas prices and new sources of energy.
 
The ad begins with a honeycomb of scenes: traffic, gas prices, the sun. Sen. John McCain is shown against a green forest as the honeycomb fills with pictures of solar energy cells, a windmill, a nuclear cooling tower.
 
""Record gas prices. A climate in crisis,"" the announcer says. ""John McCain says solve it now with a balanced plan: Alternative energy, conservation, suspending the gas tax, and more production here at home. He's pushing his own party to face climate change.""
 
When Obama appears, the announcer says, ""But Barack Obama? For conservation, but he just says no to lower gas taxes, no to nuclear, no to more production. No new solutions. Barack Obama: Just the party line.""
 
The screen says, ""No Lower Gas Taxes . . . No Nuclear Power . . . No New Offshore Production . . . No New Solutions.""
 
When we examined the McCain campaign's James Bond-inspired ad about a week ago, we found it was

right about Obama's stance on gas taxes and offshore drilling

but was

Pants on Fire wrong about his positions on nuclear power, electric cars and innovation.

 
The topics in the RNC ad will be new to viewers who haven't seen the 007 Web ad, so here's how they claims rate:
 
• The RNC ad is right on gas taxes. Obama opposes the McCain proposal for a summertime suspension of the federal gas tax. Obama has said he doubts the benefit would be passed to consumers and, even if it were, they would get only 30 cents a day.
 
• The ad wrongly says Obama opposes nuclear power. In fact, turn to page 4 in Obama's energy plan and you'll find he supports ""Safe and Secure Nuclear Energy,"" although he emphasizes the importance of securing nuclear fuel and finding safe places to store nuclear waste.
 
• The ad is correct that Obama opposes expanding the offshore production of oil.
 
• It is wrong to say Obama offers ""no new solutions."" Obama's 11-page energy program is filled with proposals such as incentives for communities to invest in biofuels refineries, more emphasis on clean coal and expanded research for biofuels, and solar and wind power.
 
So let's check the score for the RNC: two right, two wrong. Overall, that sounds to us like the ad is Half True.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'Joe Biden']","
McCain doesn't flip-flop much on Iraq
","Joe Biden appeared on

Meet the Press

on June 22, 2008, to promote Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama. One of his first chores was to defend Obama from charges of flip-flopping for opting out of the public financing system.
 
""I'm not sure this is the place this debate should go, but if you talk about flip-flopping, you've got John McCain all of a sudden deciding now we should drill in 600-million acres offshore that he adamantly opposed before,"" Biden said. ""You've got John McCain changing his position on Iraq. He started off talking about how they were going to be accepted and greeted with open arms and how we'd have a lot of money to pay — oil to pay for this war, etc.""
 
We've already checked into whether McCain has been consistent on oil drilling, a charge others have made.
 
We concluded that McCain has mostly been consistent in his position on oil drilling.

 
And Biden is on shaky ground when he says McCain changed his position on Iraq. McCain was definitely a supporter of the war and spoke positively about prospects for the invasion. But he also warned early on that creating a functioning government in Iraq would be difficult.
 
""I think we're in a long and difficult process of bringing democracy to a country that's never experienced it,"" McCain told Fox News on May 31, 2003. ""I know it's going to be very, very expensive. This is one of the reasons why I thought the tax cuts were premature. We have to spend a lot more money on this issue, on the reconstruction as well as the cost of the military action in Iraq. And I think we need to get a handle on those costs. I think it's going to be long. I think it's going to be difficult. And this will not be the first — the last extension of the presence of the U.S. military in Iraq, I'm sorry to say. But it doesn't mean it wasn't a worthwhile effort.""
 
On the issue of Iraq, McCain was asked specifically about flip-flopping on Jan. 10, 2007, by moderator Tim Russert on

Meet the Press.

 
Russert: ""Go back, senator, to 2002 — the administration saying we'd be greeted as liberators, John McCain saying that you thought success would be fairly easy.""
 
McCain: ""Well, it was easy. It was easy. I said we — a military operation would be easy. It was easy. We were greeted as liberators. Look at the films when we rolled into Baghdad. And then there was a period of time where we allowed looting, when the whole country literally evolved into chaos. I went over there. I saw what was happening. I came back, and I made a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations and said exactly, tragically, what was going to happen unless we got control of the situation. It was easy, by the way.""
 
Russert: ""But certainly securing the peace and instilling a democracy in Iraq has been far more challenging —""
 
McCain: ""Absolutely. Just as I said it would be.""
 
Russert: ""But not nearly as much as the administration had suggested to the American people?""
 
McCain: ""Well, the mistake and failure ... it's well-documented of what happened. We went in there, we won an easy military victory. They did greet us as liberators. The recent testimony of Saddam Hussein's own words indicate what kind of brutality they were subjected to. And then all of a sudden the looting started, understandably. We didn't have control of Anbar province. We didn't have control — eventually, there was a steady deterioration which led us to the terrible situation that we are in today. And all along, it was because we did not have the classic counterinsurgency strategy which is clear: hold and build. We cleared and would leave. As I've said in other hearings, we were playing a game of Whack-a-Mole.""
 
When Biden says McCain has changed position on Iraq, he's pointing toward his comments early in the invasion. As the situation in Iraq has changed over time, elected officials have changed the way they've talked about Iraq. For fact-checking purposes, we have granted them that leeway without calling them out as flip-floppers. For an example, see how we critiqued

attacks here

and

here

on Barack Obama that cherry-pick from the time in 2004 when Iraq was relatively calm. And even in the face of poll numbers showing public support for the war in Iraq declining, McCain still holds a fairly firm stay-the-course position.
 
Biden is glossing over too many nuances of McCain's statements on Iraq to make the charge of flip-flopper stick. We rate his claim Barely True.

Fellow POW backs up McCain's story
","A

chain e-mail

making the rounds recounts a moving anecdote Sen. John McCain has related about a fellow Vietnam prisoner of war who was severely beaten by guards for fashioning a makeshift American flag that became an inspirational symbol to fellow POWs.
 
The e-mail message encourages those who receive the e-mail to ""pass this on... and on... and on!""
 
And it leaves little doubt about its political intent, as it closes with the line, ""oh...and then you have this clown, who refuses to place his hand on his heart and say the pledge. ...""
 
This is an obvious, and misguided, swipe at Sen. Barack Obama, who has frequently been attacked in chain e-mails for allegedly refusing to place his hand on his heart when saying the Pledge of Allegiance. We at PolitiFact already

debunked that myth.

 
But here we will check the accuracy of McCain's POW anecdote, which was forwarded to us by several PolitiFact readers.
 
Here's how the chain e-mail reads, in part:
 
""One of the men who moved into my (POW) room was a young man named Mike Christian. ... Mike got himself a bamboo needle. Over a period of a couple of months, he created an American flag and sewed on the inside of his shirt.
 
""Every afternoon, before we had a bowl of soup, we would hang Mike's shirt on the wall of the cell and say the Pledge of Allegiance.
 
""I know the Pledge of Allegiance may not seem the most important part of our day now, but I can assure you that in that stark cell it was indeed the most important and meaningful event.
 
""One day the Vietnamese searched our cell, as they did periodically, and discovered Mike's shirt with the flag sewn inside, and removed it.
 
""That evening they returned, opened the door of the cell, and for the benefit of all of us, beat Mike Christian severely for the next couple of hours. Then, they opened the door of the cell and threw him in. We cleaned him up as well as we could.
 
""The cell in which we lived had a concrete slab in the middle on which we slept. Four naked light bulbs hung in each corner of the room.
 
""As I said, we tried to clean up Mike as well as we could. After the excitement died down, I looked in the corner of the room, and sitting there beneath that dim light bulb with a piece of red cloth, another shirt and his bamboo needle, was my friend, Mike Christian. He was sitting there with his eyes almost shut from the beating he had received, making another American flag. He was not making the flag because it made Mike Christian feel better. He was making that flag because he knew how important it was to us to be able to pledge our allegiance to our flag and country.
 
""So the next time you say the Pledge of Allegiance, you must never forget the sacrifice and courage that thousands of Americans have made to build our nation and promote freedom around the world. You must remember our duty, our honor, and our country.""
 
McCain relates this same anecdote in his book,

Faith of My Fathers,

in nearly identical fashion.
 
And the story is backed up by another POW, Leo K. Thorsness, albeit with a couple small differences in detail.
 
Thorsness was an Air Force fighter pilot who was shot down on his 93rd mission and spent six years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi.
 
When people ask if he lived with McCain at the Hanoi Hilton, Thorsness likes to correct: ""John lived with me. I got there first.""
 
Thorsness, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for valor in the Vietnam War, recalled to PolitiFact ""the day when Mike Christian found this slimy old rag, an old dirty handkerchief"" while in the yard outside the cell.
 
Thorsness said Christian spent days cleaning up the handkerchief, and used blue ink and ground up red roof tiles for color. Then, he took threads from his blanket and sewed on stars with a bamboo needle.
 
It took a good bit of imagination to make out that it was an American flag, Thorsness said, ""but we all knew what it was."" When Christian finished the flag and showed it to his fellow POWs, Thorsness said, ""I think every one of us snapped to attention.""
 
It was a tough group of men, he said, and yet there were very few dry eyes.
 
Sometimes, he said, it was hung up on a cell wall and men would salute it and say the Pledge of Allegiance.
 
""To everyone there, it was very meaningful,"" he said.
 
Christian knew full well that he would eventually be caught and punished, Thorsness said. Christian hid the makeshift flag in an extra sleeve of his pajamas. But it was discovered by the guards and confiscated during a surprise inspection.
 
That night, the guards came for Christian, Thorsness said, and ""they beat him mercilessly through most of the night. They beat the hell out of him. But Mike was one tough guy.""
 
And soon after, Thorsness said, Christian was back at it again making another flag.
 
""Anyone who witnessed that was moved,"" Thorsness said. ""It made a lasting impression.""
 
Christian died in a Virginia home fire in 1983.
 
Thorsness was later elected to the state Senate in Washington in 1988. During a flag amendment debate, Thorsness spoke publicly for the first time about Mike Christian's flag.
 
""Every other senator turned their heads and looked at me,"" Thorsness said.
 
The story was later published in 1992 in

Reader's Digest.

 
Several details in Thorsness' account differ from McCain's recollection, such as whether the handkerchief was a rag found in the prison yard or, as McCain tells it, part of a care package allowed in by the guards. But the stories are substantially the same. We rule McCain's story True.

"['National', 'Civil Rights', 'Terrorism', 'Bob Barr']","
While on Big Brother watch, Barr hits McCain
","
Libertarian presidential candidate and ex-Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr may have turned his back on his old party, but he hasn't abandoned his crusade to limit the reach of federal law enforcement.
 
Asked on Fox News about the differences between himself and presumptive GOP nominee Sen. John McCain, Barr pointed to a compromise plan to overhaul electronic spying rules that the Senate took up before the July Fourth recess and that McCain supports.
 
The legislation is intended to address some of the privacy concerns that arose after the 2005 disclosure of the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping program. It would rewrite the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA – the law that governs surveillance of foreign terrorist suspects – and permit warrantless eavesdropping on foreign targets who may be communicating with people in the United States, although with some court supervision of the surveillance procedures. The House passed the bill in a 293-129 vote on June 20.
 
What most irks civil libertarians like Barr is the way the plan leaves it to the government to decide if it's violating Americans' privacy rights.
 
""The legislation that is now pending before the Senate, that just passed the House, that Senator McCain supports would provide the authority for the federal government to surveille American citizens in their own country without any suspicion whatsoever that they're engaging in discussions with terrorists or about criminal activity,"" Barr said.
 
Barr's characterization is essentially correct. The plan allows the attorney general and director of national intelligence to authorize surveillance of a suspect for up to one year without a warrant if the target is ""reasonably believed to be located outside the United States (and) to acquire foreign intelligence information."" That would include conversations between the target and people in the United States, including citizens. There is no requirement that the suspect be explicitly connected to any terrorist or criminal activity, though the bill's definition of foreign intelligence information includes sabotage, international terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
 
Before any surveillance begins, a secret FISA court would have to review the executive branch's targeting process. But the administration could begin surveillance before the court review if it declares ""exigent,"" or urgent, circumstances.
 
Though the government has argued its activities are only directed at foreigners overseas, skeptics such as James X. Dempsey, policy director of the Center for Democracy & Technology, contend it is virtually certain that some suspects will communicate with people in the United States, where constitutional protections apply to national security activities. To assure the expansion of surveillance powers won't gut Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure, many critics believe the government should first establish probable cause, by obtaining a warrant from a court that decides whether the activities are reasonably designed to intercept terrorists' communications while not infringing on the rights of innocent Americans.
 
However, the administration and its allies in Congress have continuously resisted requirements for prior court reviews of surveillance procedures, citing, among other things, the president's constitutional authority to protect the United States and a 2001 law authorizing the use of force against groups or nations involved in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Democratic leaders in Congress reluctantly went along in the current debate, saying the compromise was preferable to a White House-backed plan that would have required less court and congressional oversight.
 
The FISA law, as it's informally known, does not permit the targeting of a U.S. citizen overseas without such a warrant. And the plan under consideration in Congress contains some safeguards to protect ""reverse targeting"" of Americans while outlining so-called ""minimization"" procedures intended to limit the information that can be retained and disseminated on U.S. citizens.
 
Still, as written, the plan would permit the government under certain circumstances to listen to Americans without a warrant. And it would not require the executive branch to demonstrate that a suspect is engaged in terrorist or criminal activity. For these reasons, we deem Barr's claim True.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Wesley Clark']","
McCain ran a Navy unit of 1,000 people
","Retired Gen. Wesley Clark threw a rhetorical grenade into the campaign this week with the suggestion that Sen. John McCain's military experience does not necessarily qualify him to be president.
 
On

CBS' Face the Nation

on Sunday, Clark praised McCain for being ""a hero to me and to hundreds of thousands and millions of others in the armed forces"" and acknowledged the Arizona senator had extensive experience as a member of the Armed Services Committee.
 
""But,"" Clark said, ""he hasn't held executive responsibility.""
 
McCain's campaign quickly fired back, mobilizing its ""Truth Squad,"" retired officials who worked with McCain in the Navy or were imprisoned with him in North Vietnam. During a hastily arranged conference call with reporters, Truth Squad members said that they were ""shocked"" by Clark's criticism and that McCain is well qualified to be commander in chief.
 
Yet Clark, a Democrat who has endorsed Obama, had zeroed in on a weakness in McCain's resume. He served 22 years in the Navy, four in the U.S. House of Representatives and 22 in the Senate, but McCain, 71, has not been a mayor, a governor or a chief executive.
 
The closest he came to such a job was serving as commanding officer of a large pilot training group after he returned from Vietnam. But Clark dismissed that as an inconsequential non-combat assignment.
 
""He hasn't been there and ordered the bombs to fall,"" Clark said.
 

'Skipper'

 
McCain's career can be divided into two parts — his Navy service from 1958 to 1980, and his political career from 1982 to today. His political work has been entirely in the legislative branch of government, so — even though he oversees a Senate staff of about 60 — he is a legislator, not an executive.
 
McCain's naval career is legend: He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1958, became a fighter pilot and was shot down over North Vietman, where he was a POW for 5 years.
 
But it was after he returned to the United States, during a less familiar chapter in his life, when McCain served at the air group in the role he now cites as his executive experience. His 13-month command of the Replacement Air Group 174 in Jacksonville shows how he manages and provides clues about what he might be like as president.
 
In 1975, McCain became executive officer of the group, which trained pilots and crew members for aircraft carrier service. The RAG, as it was known, had 1,000 people and 75 planes, which made it the Navy's largest aviation squadron.
 
Eyebrows were raised when he became commanding officer a few months later. Some in the Navy suspected favoritism because he was the son and grandson of famous Navy officers.
 
But according to the author of a McCain biography and three people who served under McCain in the training group, he earned high marks for invigorating a unit that had been struggling with a fleet of broken planes.
 
""He was very inspirational,"" said Bob Stumpf, a student pilot at the RAG who later became the leader of the Navy's Blue Angel team. ""He was just always personally involved in the goings-on of the squadron. He didn't hide in his office.""
 
The energetic McCain, known in the unit as ""Skipper,"" frequently stopped by the maintenance shops and pilots' ""ready rooms"" so he could stay in touch with the people he commanded.
 

A demanding boss

 
Robert Timberg, author of

John McCain: An American Odyssey

, said the air group was ""an enormously large operation"" and that McCain was well regarded for his work.
 
Carl Smith, who served as a flight instructor with the group and is now a Washington attorney and lobbyist, said McCain was a savvy manager who got rid of ineffective employees, hired talented people, set goals and kept his workers motivated.
 
""He gave the old crowd a chance to perform. But when they didn't, he fired them,"" said Smith, who is on the campaign's Truth Squad.
 
McCain inherited a squadron that had many crippled planes because the good ones had been sent on carrier missions. He set a goal of getting them all repaired and, to the surprise of many in the Navy, achieved the goal in just over a year.
 
""He basically turned that squadron around,"" said Stumpf.
 
Ross Fischer, an instructor pilot in the RAG, said McCain was a demanding boss but gave his staff plenty of authority once he saw they could do the job.
 
More than 30 years after working with him in the RAG, Fischer, Smith and Stumpf are supporting McCain's presidential campaign in part because of what they saw in Jacksonville.
 
Said Fischer of McCain, ""He's a born leader.""
 

An executive job

 
Clark's larger point is correct: McCain has accomplished a lot in his storied military and political career, but he has relatively little executive experience.
 
But still, Clark, who ran for president in 2004, was incorrect to say that McCain ""hasn't held executive responsibility."" His tenure at the RAG shows that McCain not only held an executive post in which he managed a staff of 1,000 and oversaw a fleet of 75 planes, but he earned positive reviews for his performance. When McCain departed, the unit was given its first-ever Meritorious Unit Citation.
 
So we find Clark's claim to be False.

Nader denied saying that, which immediately raised our interest here at PolitiFact. We could've sworn we remembered Nader repeatedly saying there was no difference between the two. In fact, we thought it was a central theme of his 2000 campaign.
 
Here's the full exchange, from the June 18 broadcast of

Democracy Now!:

 

Goodman: ""Ralph Nader, you said in 2000 it doesn't really matter whether Gore or Bush is president. Do you feel that way today?""

 

Nader: ""I didn't say that. I said the similarities between Bush and Gore tower over the dwindling real differences that they're willing to argue over.""

 
We scoured hundreds of news reports from 2000 looking for an instance of Nader saying Gore and Bush were the same, or that it didn't matter which was elected, or any equivalent phrase.
 
We didn't find those words, but we did find many instances of supporters, opponents, reporters and commentators characterizing Nader's position in those terms.
 
For example, in a

New York Times

opinion piece in August, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote: ""While I admire Mr. Nader's high-minded ideals, his suggestion that there is no difference between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush is irresponsible.""
 
Nader took exception to this paraphrase of his position, as he did from time to time throughout the campaign.
 
""I have indicated that there are 'few major differences' between the two parties,"" Nader responded in a

letter

to the

Times,

""not that there is 'no difference between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush,' as Mr. Kennedy wrote.""
 
There's a reason Kennedy and so many other observers were left with this impression. Again and again throughout the campaign, Nader implied that he thought Bush and Gore equally objectionable. ""It doesn't matter who is in the White House, Gore or Bush, for the vast majority of government departments and agencies,"" Nader said in a news conference in September 2000.
 
""The only difference between Al Gore and George W. Bush is the velocity with which their knees hit the floor when corporations knock on their door,"" he told supporters in California a month later.
 
""It's a Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dum vote,"" Nader said in Philadelphia four days before the election, repeating a favorite refrain of his. ""Both parties are selling our government to big business paymasters. ...That's a pretty serious similarity.""
 
Nader also failed to challenge Sam Donaldson on ABC's

This Week

when Donaldson said, ""You don't think it matters. You've said it doesn't matter to you who is the president of the United States, Bush or Gore.""
 
Nader replied, ""Because it's the permanent corporate government that's running the show here ... you can see they're morphing more and more on more and more issues into one corporate party.""
 
A few other news reports quoted Nader saying outright that it didn't matter whether Gore and Bush got elected, but these reports didn't provide enough context for us to feel comfortable pinning the sentiment on Nader. For example, here's a line from a

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

piece on Oct. 26, 2000: ""In comments as hostile to Gore as to Bush, Nader said it 'doesn't matter' which of them wins because both parties are mired in 'decay.' ""
 
Maybe he said that, but without a fuller quote, we have to allow for the possibility that he stopped just short of saying it, as he did in most of his campaign appearances.
 
So no, Nader never explicitly said ""it doesn't really matter whether Gore or Bush is president."" But his talk of ""Republicrats,"" ""Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,"" and ""one corporate party"" left many people — friend, foe and impartial observer alike — with the impression that that's what he believed. We find Nadar's statement that he ""never said"" it to be Barely True.

Welfare rolls dropped, but not just because of law
","In a new TV ad, Sen. Barack Obama takes credit for reducing welfare rolls in Illinois.
 
The ad begins with photos of Obama after he graduated from college, of a padlocked industrial site and of a working-class neighborhood.
 
""He worked his way through college and Harvard Law ... turned down big money offers, and helped lift neighborhoods stung by job loss. Fought for workers' rights.""
 
The announcer continues, ""He passed a law to move people from welfare to work, slashed the rolls by 80 percent ... passed tax cuts for workers ... health care for kids. As president, he'll end tax breaks for companies that export jobs, reward those that create jobs in America. And never forget the dignity that comes from work.""
 
We previously examined Obama's claim that he passed

the welfare-to-work law (and gave him a Mostly True),

so here we'll examine his new claim that the law reduced welfare rolls by 80 percent.
 
Obama was a state senator in 1997 when Illinois, like other states, was forced to adapt to the federal welfare reform law. Obama became the key Senate Democrat for the bill, working to make sure the Illinois program, Temporary Assistance For Needy Families, met the federal guidelines and also had provisions to ease the transition for people leaving the program. Obama played a role in making sure the program had a child care subsidy and was the prime sponsor of another bill that required the state to study the effects of welfare reform.
 
After the main reform law took effect, the number of welfare recipients began dropping sharply, from 167,124 in 1998 to 36,331 in 2006, which represents a 78 percent drop. So the campaign is correct about the size of the decline.
 
But the law was not the sole cause of the decline, according to John Bouman, director of advocacy for the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, who was involved in shaping the bill.
 
Bouman, a supporter and contributor to Obama's campaign, says the law was the main cause of the decline, but he estimates that about one-fourth to one-third of the drop was caused by the administrators of the state program who Bouman says were too hasty in ejecting many people from the program.
 
Bouman called that ""a harsh side of it that (Obama) was not an architect of — that was less the on-paper policy and more the administrative practices of the governor at the time.""
 
Dan Lewis, a Northwestern University professor who was hired to study the program (and also is an Obama supporter), says it is difficult to estimate what percentage of the decline is due to the bill or other factors such as the approach of state officials.
 
But Lewis said he did not disagree with Bouman's estimate.
 
Gary MacDougal, former chairman of the Illlinois Republican Party and the chairman of the Illinois Governor's Task Force for Human Services Reform, downplays Obama's role in the bill and agreed with Bouman that there were other significant factors in the decline besides the state law. He said the most important factor was the governor's reorganization of state agencies, and he said the booming economy of the 1990s was also ""very helpful"" in the decline.
 
So the Obama ad is right about the size of the decline, but is reaching too far by taking credit for it. We find this claim Half True.

"['National', 'Elections', 'Ralph Nader']","
Number stands up, even if other details don't
","Perennial presidential candidate Ralph Nader is in an uphill battle for both media coverage and significant poll numbers. But somehow he's managing to get the latter without getting any of the former, he said in a recent radio interview.
 
""The most recent Associated Press poll has Nader-Gonzalez at 6 percent, without any national coverage, against McCain and Obama,"" Nader said during a June 18

interview

on

Democracy Now!,

an independent, left-leaning radio program.
 
Nader garnered less than half that in the 2000 election and, by many accounts, damaged Al Gore enough to hand George W. Bush the White House.
 
We checked

the Associated Press polls

and found none that gave Nader 6 percent. The most recent AP poll prior to the interview was an AP-Yahoo poll from April 17 that had Nader at 3 percent.
 
Nader spokesman Chris Driscoll acknowledged the candidate had erred, and said he meant to cite a June 6

CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll

, which did indeed have Nader and his running mate Matt Gonzalez at 6 percent against Democratic Sen. Barack Obama, Republican Sen. John McCain and former GOP Rep. Bob Barr, the Libertarian candidate.
 
The finding needs context, though. Was it just an outlier? And what does it say about how Nader will do in November?
 
Other recent polls show Nader with less support.

A Rasmussen Reports poll

released May 18 showed Nader pulling in 4 percent against Obama, McCain and Barr.

A Reuters/Zogby poll

released June 18 showed Nader with 3 percent.

A Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll

released June 19, the day after Nader's interview, gave him 4 percent.
 
History suggests, however, that even these polls overstate Nader's prospects. At this time in 2000, he was showing around 4 or 5 percent in most national polls, and he ended up with 2.7 percent of the vote. Around this time in 2004, polls had Nader at anywhere from 3 to 7 percent. He got just .38 percent in the end.
 
Now, onto Nader's assertion that his support has come ""without any national coverage."" Clearly he was speaking rhetorically — we found his name mentioned 166 times on the major broadcast and cable news programs between the first of the year and the June 18 interview.
 
But that's six months. Obama and McCain had been mentioned on television about that much in just the previous three days. Nader's coverage had been so slight compared to that of the major-party candidates that we have a hard time holding his hyperbole against him.
 
We are also reluctant to pick on Nader too much for getting the name of a poll wrong. So with the caveat that his claim says little about how he'll do in November, we find it Mostly True.

 Obama hasn't backed censure for Bush
","
Longtime consumer advocate and independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader, seeking to attract voters to the left of Sen. Barack Obama, tweaked the Democratic candidate for his unwillingness to censure President Bush.
 
""He won't even support his colleague Sen. Russ Feingold's motion to censure the Bush administration for systemic repeated illegal wiretaps,"" Nader said in a June 18

interview on the radio program Democracy Now!

""He — you know, he's letting the corporate-dominated city of Washington, the corporations who actually rule us now in Washington, determine his agenda. And that does not augur well.""
 
Feingold of Wisconsin, known as one of the most liberal Democrats in the Senate, proposed a

resolution to censure Bush

in March 2006, three months after the

New York Times


reported

that the president had secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans without warrants.
 
Censure, a congressional action that is not defined in the Constitution, has evolved as a formal expression of strong condemnation that is short of impeachment. The Senate has censured only one U.S. president — Andrew Jackson, in 1834, for firing the secretary of the treasury in a dispute over deposits in a national bank. Jackson's party, the Democrats, later expunged the censure.
 
Feingold's proposal was to ""condemn [Bush's] unlawful authorization of wiretaps of Americans within the United States without obtaining the court orders required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.""
 
Republicans immediately attacked the measure, and many Democrats distanced themselves from it, including the senator and future presidential candidate from Illinois.
 
""It's not impeachment, but it's not something you apply lightly,"" Obama told the

Chicago Tribune

at the time. ""And whether we want to start applying censure motions or impeachment when there are questions about a president's authority in national security is something that you have to be judicious about.""
 
Only three senators — Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and John Kerry, D-Mass. — have co-sponsored Feingold's resolution. It has not moved out of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
 
The Obama campaign did not respond to requests to clarify his position on this censure proposal. His past comments and his decision not to co-sponsor Feingold's resolution lead us to conclude Nader was correct in saying Obama does not support it. We find Nader's claim to be True.

 James Bond-inspired ad is on target about drilling and gas taxes
","A new Web video from Sen. John McCain's campaign invokes James Bond to portray Sen. Barack Obama as an opponent of McCain's energy initiatives.
 
With music that sounds like the 007 theme, the ad opens with Obama in silhoutte and the words ""Barack Obama Is Dr. No.""
 
The words change to ""No To Drilling Offshore Oil"" while Obama is heard saying, ""Offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today.""
 
The screen says, ""No To A Gas Tax Holiday"" while Obama says, ""I think John McCain's proposal for a three-month tax holiday is a bad idea.""
 
""No To Innovation. No To The Electric Car"" appears on the screen while Obama says ""In this campaign, John McCain is offering the same old gimmicks.""
 
""No To Clean, Safe, Nuclear Energy"" while Obama says ""I start off with the premise that nuclear energy is not optimal. I am not a nuclear energy proponent."" The ad ends with the message: ""Barack Obama Truly Is The Dr. No Of Energy Security.""
 
The ad is part of an effort by the McCain campaign to portray Obama as an obstructionist on energy policy. We were surprised to find the ad had a split personality. The drilling and gas tax claims were accurate, as we'll explain below. But we found McCain was

Pants-on-Fire wrong

with his claims about Obama's positions on innovation, the car and nuclear power.
 
The drilling claim refers to Obama's response after McCain suggested on June 16, 2008, that states be given authority to decide whether to permit offshore drilling. Indeed, that day Obama's campaign said he was opposed, and on June 20 the candidate reiterated his opposition during a stop in Jacksonville, Fla.
 
""I will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off Florida's coasts,"" Obama said in his prepared remarks for that appearance. He also said McCain was misleading voters by suggesting more drilling would lower gas prices, because it would take many years before a significant amount of oil was produced.
 
The ad's claim about the gas tax holiday refers to Obama's response to another McCain proposal, to eliminate the federal tax on gasoline between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Obama has repeatedly said he opposes the idea because oil companies would not pass along the savings and, even if they did, it would provide relatively little help to consumers. (We checked Obama's claim that it would save a typical motorist about 30 cents a day and found it

Mostly True.

)
 
So on these points, McCain's right. Obama is opposed to changing the rules on offshore drilling and suspending the gas tax. McCain gets a True.

This 007 claim is out of ammo
","A new Web video from Sen. John McCain's campaign portrays Sen. Barack Obama as an opponent of electric cars, nuclear power and energy ""innovation.""

The words change to ""No To Drilling Offshore Oil"" while Obama is heard saying, ""Offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today.""

The screen says ""No To Clean, Safe, Nuclear Energy"" while Obama says ""I start off with the premise that nuclear energy is not optimal. I am not a nuclear energy proponent."" The ad ends with the message: ""Barack Obama Truly Is The Dr. No Of Energy Security.""
 
The ad is part of an effort by the McCain campaign to portray Obama as an obstructionist on energy policy. The ad has a kind of split personality. While the drilling and gas tax claims were accurate, as we explain

in this item,

the other claims were strikingly wrong.
 
In this item, we'll examine the claims about electric cars, nuclear power and innovation.
 
Let's take electric cars first. To back this up, the McCain campaign cites Obama's statement that McCain's $300-million prize for improving car batteries was ""a gimmick.""
 
But that doesn't prove Obama said ""no"" to electric cars. (As our friends at FactCheck.org

have pointed out,

the McCain campaign ignored an Obama remark in which he was criticizing McCain for

not doing more

than the battery prize.)
 
In fact, Obama has said his energy plan will lead to more electric cars. In a speech on June 16, Obama said his proposal to invest $150-billion in energy programs would lead to new jobs ""that will be created when plug-in hybrids or electric cars start rolling off the assembly line here in Michigan.""
 
In a speech on May 14, he praised Chrysler for ""working to develop a system that integrates electric motors with a fixed-gear transmission.""
 
That doesn't sound like ""no"" to us.
 
Against innovation? To back that up, the McCain campaign cites the same line that McCain's battery plan was a gimmick.
 
But Obama last October proposed a decade-long, $150-billion energy program that would increase research and create new jobs developing ""climate-friendly energy supplies that will move us toward energy independence.""
 
An 11-page account of his plan, titled

Barack Obama's Plan to Make America a Global Energy Leader,

includes incentives for communities to invest in biofuels refineries, more emphasis on clean coal and ""safe and secure nuclear energy."" That sounds to us like a pretty significant attempt at innovation.
 
Which brings us to the McCain ad's last point, that Obama said ""No To Clean, Safe, Nuclear Energy."" To the contrary, it's right there on page 4 of Obama's energy plan: ""Safe and Secure Nuclear Energy."" It's not a blanket endorsement — Obama says it's important to protect the security of nuclear fuel and waste and determine how to store the waste — but it's still a part of his plan.
 
So McCain is way, way off with these charges. It's not that he's just missing nuances or exaggerating; he has completely distorted Obama's positions, falsely claiming that Obama opposes research and innovation on the most significant political issue of the summer.
 
He portrays Obama as a impediment to energy research when the Democratic candidate has been at least as assertive on the issue as McCain has — and has been touting his energy plan since last October. It's so wrong we have to set the meter ablaze: Pants on Fire.

"['Income', 'Wealth', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Ryan says wealthy taxpayers get most of the deductions in the tax code
","
Paul Ryan pushed back against Democratic claims that the middle class would see a tax increase under Mitt Romney’s proposals, saying the reality of the tax code doesn’t square with that.

Ryan fielded questions about the tax plan in a Fox News interview as he headed to the Republican National Convention in Tampa.

""The people who get most of the deductions are the people in the top tax brackets, the wealthy, not middle-income taxpayers,"" Ryan explained. ""And so what we’re saying is by getting rid of these deductions that higher income earners get, more of their income is subject to taxation, and that means we can lower tax rates for everybody.""

The question of whose ox gets gored is front and center every time tax reform is considered, of course.

Was the vice presidential nominee correct that top earners get most of the breaks in the current income tax code?

Three tax experts told us that tax preferences are indeed tilted heavily to the rich, though how you define ""rich"" makes a difference.

The most detailed report we found on how much households save because of tax preferences came from the Tax Policy Center in September 2011.

It shows that the top fifth of earners get two-thirds of the total pie of savings from individual income tax breaks, including preferential rates on itemized deductions such as home mortgage interest and lower capital gains tax rates. The study uses 2011 income data.

The top 5 percent alone get 41 percent of the total tax savings associated with these breaks, the study found. The ""middle"" 60 percent of earners, by contrast, get less than a third of the benefit, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.

The effect is even more pronounced if just the major itemized deductions are eliminated, but other breaks are kept, Williams said.

It makes sense, Williams said. Lower earners have lower tax rates, so they get less benefit from the breaks than wealthier people who have more to deduct and pay higher tax rates.

""They do benefit disproportionately,"" he said.

Daniel Mitchell, a Cato Institute senior fellow who studies tax reform, said the state and local tax deduction and charitable contributions deduction are ""very heavily tilted to the rich."" He added: ""The mortgage interest deduction is tilted to the rich as well, but not as dramatically.""

We should note that Romney’s tax reform plan does not call for dumping all tax deductions. He has said that if some deductions were eliminated, overall rates could be lowered. While he’s provided some specifics, the fate of many deductions is left unclear.

As always in tax matters, there are some nuances here.

In sheer numbers, some tax deductions such as the mortgage interest deduction are claimed by far more middle- and lower-income people than by people in the top brackets, IRS data shows. That’s in part a reflection of how broad the middle class is compared to the upper-income tiers.

Tax savings from various preferences are spread throughout the population, from tax credits for low-income people to investment tax breaks for the wealthy, Williams noted.

Ryan’s campaign cited IRS data showing greater benefits as you rise through the tax brackets, and that’s confirmed in the Tax Policy Center analysis, we found.

Our third expert, William McBride, chief economist for the Tax Foundation, said judging Ryan’s statement ""depends on the definition of rich.""

Ryan gave a clue - people in the ""top brackets."" But in 2011 there were six income tax brackets ranging from 10 percent to 35 percent, and drawing the line between the middle class and ""wealthy"" is a subjective call.

The big benefits for the top fifth of earners, as found by the Tax Policy Center, are in a group whose incomes start at $103,000. Is that ""wealthy?""

What if, like President Barack Obama, you set $250,000 and up as a benchmark for raising tax rates for the ""wealthy?"" People in that group got less than 40 percent of the tax savings -- a figure that is somewhat at odds with the ""most"" description used by Ryan.

Still, our experts said that, overall, it’s clear the benefits are tilted heavily to the upper end of the income scale. One more example: Just 0.1 percent of earners alone got 13 percent of the benefits, the Tax Policy Center study found.

Our ruling

Ryan, countering criticism of Romney tax plan, said that wealthy taxpayers, not middle-income earners, get ""most of the deductions"" in the tax code.

He’s on target, with the caveat that it partly depends on the definition of ""wealthy."" Wealthier people pay higher tax rates and tend to get more benefit from deductions than lower-income earners.

We rate his statement Mostly True.

Sher Valenzuela says regulation is a big factor holding back small businesses
","
At the Republican National Convention, the GOP candidate for lieutenant governor of Delaware picked up a frequent complaint of Republicans -- that government regulation is hampering hiring by businesses, particularly small businesses.

""A Gallup report recently said that nearly 50 percent of small business owners aren't hiring because of what they call ‘regulatory uncertainty,"" Valenzuela said.

We wondered whether that was correct.

We found a survey conducted by Gallup in January 2012 that addresses this point -- the Wells Fargo Small Business Survey, which interviewed 600 small business owners by phone. It has a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

Valenzuela can find some support for her comment in the poll results. One of the questions asked was, ""Why are you not looking for new employees? For each of the following, please indicate if it is a reason why you are not looking to hire."" When offered the option, ""Worried about new government regulations,"" 46 percent of business owners surveyed said yes. That’s fairly close to half.

However, that leaves out some important context.

For starters, 53 percent -- a majority -- said they did not consider government regulations to be a barrier to future hiring.

At least as important, government regulation ranked pretty far down the list of factors offered.

Of the eight factors suggested (not counting ""other""), concern about government regulations ranked sixth. More popular answers were ""don't need any additional employees at this time"" (76 percent), ""worried revenues or sales won't justify adding more employees"" (71 percent), ""worried about the current status of the U.S. economy"" (66 percent), ""worried about cash flow or ability to make payroll"" (53 percent) and ""worried about the potential cost of health care"" (48 percent).

In its analysis of the survey data, Gallup took a middle-of-the-road analysis.

""The debate over why U.S. small-business owners aren't hiring more aggressively tends to hinge on whether overall business conditions, including a lack of growth and revenue, are the primary culprit as opposed to the potential cost of healthcare and government regulations,"" Gallup wrote. ""Apparently, both sides of the debate are correct.

""Small-business owners hire when they need to respond to increased business activity and have the opportunity to grow. Although some small businesses in selected industries and markets have been growing, the weak economy of the past four years has limited overall small-business growth. ...

""Given this difficult operating environment, it is not surprising that many small-business owners also worry about potential new health care costs and government regulations. While small businesses are always finding ways to deal with their changing operating environment, including government regulations and health care, these added challenges can be seen as exacerbating an already uncertain and difficult situation. In turn, they become additional reasons to hold back on hiring.""

Our rating

Valenzuela is close to correct when she says that ""a Gallup report recently said nearly 50 percent of small businesses owners aren't hiring because of what they call ‘regulatory uncertainty.’"" (It’s a bit short of 50 percent, and it was a survey from nine months ago.)

However, this claim leaves out some important context. Five other factors ranked higher on a list of eight factors that might be impeding hiring. Essentially, Valenzuela cherry-picked one of the factors to make her point, which suggested that it was the only, or main, reason for the lack of hiring.

"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Ted Lyon']","
Ted Lyon says most Texas schools spend 45 days on mandated tests
","
In an opinion column that appeared in Texas newspapers (including the Austin American-Statesman on Aug. 1, 2012), former state Sen. Ted Lyon criticized current state lawmakers for cutting education funds but sticking to mandated state exams that he called wasteful and expensive.

""Mandated tests consume valuable time that should be used for teaching,"" Lyon wrote. ""Most schools spend 45 days out of the 180 days in a school year in some form of mandated testing. This type of thinking is absurd.""

A Statesman reader asked us: Does Texas spend a quarter of its school days on such tests?

We were curious, too, especially as we had recently rated Mostly False a claim that Austin’s school district lists 64 days a year for state testing. In that fact-check, we found 34 days were tabbed by the Austin district in 2011-12 for state testing and make-up/re-test exams, but that not all grades or all students took tests on each of those days.

Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us the number of testing dates in Texas schools has increased over the years in response to state and federal mandates.

Most of the tests are conducted in high schools, Ratcliffe said, with the introduction of end-of-course exams in the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness program.

As we started on this article, we interviewed Lyon by phone and email and were unable to pin down how he arrived at the 45-day figure.

Lyon, a Mesquite lawyer and Democrat who was a House member and then senator from 1979 into early 1993, told us that he based his statement on conversations with current and former education administrators, most at the district level, plus work done for Lyon by a researcher.

Without giving us specific numbers, he told us that what he learned convinced him that most Texas students were being pulled ""into a testing mode all day"" for state-mandated tests on at least 45 to 50 days a year.

Since the 1980s, Texas students have taken some form of state-mandated exam. Last year, Texas began phasing out the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills and replacing it with the more rigorous STAAR. TEA, the state government body in charge of kindergarten-12th grade public education, oversees the testing program.

STAAR is being rolled into place with the high-school class of 2015; students graduating in 2013 and ’14, who took the TAKS in ninth grade, will still take the TAKS to graduate.

In our April story, TEA’s Ratcliffe said, ""Any one kid is only going to spend two to five days a year taking the state tests"" unless he or she fails, in which case re-testing would be possible. We asked for more detail for this story, and Ratcliffe explained that students in grades 3-5, 6-8 and 9-11 are tested on two to five subjects per year.

The state’s 2011-12 testing calendar shows that districts were required to hold STAAR and TAKS on 25 specific days plus four flexible testing periods (when districts can schedule tests as needed). If a district had at least one test in each flexible period, its minimum number of testing dates would have been 29. The maximum allowed is 45 days.

However, each individual school would only administer the tests required in its grade levels; for example, elementary schools are not conducting the pre-graduation end-of-course exams. And the 29 to 45 dates on the STAAR calendar included re-tests and makeup tests for students who failed or missed the initial exam.

Ratcliffe helped us sort out STAAR scenarios with the most and least possible testing for individual Texas students during a school year: 
Then there are tests required at the district level. Many large and mid-size districts, Ratcliffe said, require progress checks (such as ""benchmark,"" ""field"" or six-week tests). Our earlier fact-check found that in the Austin district, benchmark testing ranged from about four days for third-graders to as many as nine days for eighth-graders, with each exam occupying up to two hours.

We reached out to officials in several Texas districts, including the ones Lyon named, and heard back from associate superintendent Cathy Rideout of the Mesquite district, just east of Dallas.

Rideout said the district’s ""benchmark""-type test is a 20-question test given four times a year to make sure students are keeping up with curricula.

All or parts of a district’s student body can also take other standardized tests. Rideout emailed us information about several in the Mesquite district: 

The Response to Intervention testing, K-2 reading tests and PSAT occur on seven days, but take less time per day than STAARs, Rideout said.

Trying to get a grip on how many tests are required at the district level around the state, we consulted officials with Texas educators’ associations, but found no organization that tracks district testing days.


Our ruling

There seems to be scant information spelling out precisely how many days most schools give mandated tests. But our sense is that Texas school districts might be giving state-mandated tests on 29 days a school year, while district-level benchmark tests can absorb about four to nine days, though admittedly that’s based only on what we gleaned from the Austin and Mesquite districts for 2011-12. The days devoted to testing at some individual schools — and, more important, for individual students — are far fewer.

Rep. Michele Bachmann claims report says the president's policies will drive up unemployment
","
In a show of GOP unity for convention week, Rep. Michele Bachmann made her case on Fox News for a Mitt Romney presidency.

She also got in her digs at the other guy.

Under President Barack Obama, she said, you should expect unemployment to rise.

""A report just came out that if we continue with President Obama's policies, we're looking at over 9 percent unemployment next year in the fourth quarter,"" Bachmann told host Sean Hannity in the Aug. 27, 2012, interview in Tampa.

The unemployment rate was 8.3 percent in July, so that would mark a serious reversal.

We decided to track down the report.

 The fiscal cliff

The former presidential candidate from Minnesota said she was referring to a report from the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency with expert staff that generates projections about how laws affect the federal budget and economy. We reached out to her office for more detail, but didn’t hear back.

So we checked out CBO's most recent such report, an update to the country’s economic outlook for the decade. It did include a projection that unemployment could reach 9.1 percent in the fourth quarter next year (Table 2-1).

But that projection was not based on continuing ""President Obama’s policies."" Rather, it was CBO’s look at what would happen if current laws are left unchanged -- which is not what Obama advocates.

""The policies that Rep. Bachmann refers to as 'President Obama’s policies' are in fact what would result if the Congress fails to reach an agreement with the president on how to continue economic stimulus policies which he strongly favors,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. (As we've noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

If the president and Congress can’t resolve their standoff, what results is referred to alternately as the ""fiscal cliff"" or ""taxmageddon."" Congress set some of the conditions for the cliff last year in their deal to increase the debt ceiling — the Budget Control Act. It specified that if Congress couldn’t find $1.2 trillion in budget cuts, automatic cuts would hit across the board, including defense programs. (Bachmann voted against the act; she opposed raising the debt ceiling and called the deal a ""temporary fix."")

So right now, current law would, for instance, impose those stiff automatic spending cuts and let major tax cuts expire. (Obama would renew the tax cuts for those earning under $250,000 and doesn’t want to see automatic cuts.) The deficit would shrink an estimated $641 billion in the next fiscal year. That would most likely lead to a recession, driving down GDP and pushing up unemployment, the CBO calculated.

That’s right: Bachmann’s talking about what would happen if the deficit shrinks.

It’s worth noting Obama plays a role in the standoff, even if he doesn’t endorse its result.

""He could be blamed, of course, for refusing to negotiate unless Republicans raise taxes, thereby making the cliff more likely,"" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""I suppose the flip side applies as well, though.""

If lawmakers and the president work out a deal that keeps the tax cuts and avoids automatic spending cuts, among other things, CBO calculates that the unemployment rate will drop to 8 percent (Table 2-2) — not rise.

Neither of those scenarios perfectly reflects Obama’s policy goals. But the second one, with its unemployment rate drop, is closest.

 Our ruling

Bachmann said, ""a report just came out that if we continue with President Obama's policies, we're looking at over 9 percent unemployment next year in the fourth quarter."" But that jobless rate is based a projection of ""current law,"" which would only happen as a result of a standoff between Congress and the president, not Obama’s own policy priorities. Unemployment would rise in the face of immediate deficit reduction — something that more closely resembles Bachmann’s preference than the president’s.

The 9 percent unemployment figure is mentioned in the CBO study, but it is inaccurate for Bachmann to say it is under Obama's policies. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2012/aug/29/michele-bachmann/rep-michele-bachmann-claims-report-says-presidents/

Convention billboard touts John Kasich's view of climate change to GOP delegates
","Republican devotees who have traveled to Tampa, Fla. for their party’s national convention expect a week filled with activities aimed at unifying the GOP around the central policy and agenda messages as they nominate former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney for president.

But as thousands of out-of-towners arrived and made their trek to the Tampa Bay Times Forum, the arena hosting the convention, they have been greeted by some well-placed advertisements featuring some prominent conservative leaders -- including Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- that are not quite in lock-step with the message Republicans have long touted.

Kasich is prominently featured on a billboard outside the arena and on one at the most central interstate highway crossing in the city, as well as, on some placards adorning 40 city taxi cabs proclaiming his belief that global warming is real.

""I am a believer – my goodness I am a Republican – I happen to believe there is a problem with climate change,"" reads a quote attributed to Kasich that appears next to a picture of the smiling Ohio governor.

But wait, Kasich is still as staunch a conservative as ever, isn’t he? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check if the ad accurately reflects the governor’s position.

The billboard was sponsored by the Florida Wildlife Federation, a private membership group with about 60,000 members who are hunters, fishermen and outdoorsmen with a keen interest in environmental issues. It told PolitiFact Ohio it partnered with the Evangelical Environmental Network, a Washington lobbying group, to place the advertisements.

The Federation’s policy consultant, Jay Liles, said his group is desperate to get politicians to view climate change as a life-changing issue and not a partisan issue. They have skin in this game. And there it is true that some Republicans have staked out a position doubting that climate change is really a factor.

In addition to Kasich, the federation also has sponsored similar ads with similar messages from similarly conservative leaders, such as, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former President George W. Bush.

We checked with Kasich’s staff to see whether the quote was accurate. Rob Nichols, the governor’s spokesman, confirmed that it was taken from a speech Kasich made in May 2012 at a small energy conference in Columbus, Ohio, that was sponsored by The Hill, a Capitol Hill media organization.

""What they have on the billboard is accurate,"" Nichols said, adding that Kasich has uttered similar comments four or five times during various private speeches, some of which were before Republican gatherings.
 
But for context, Nichols said there is a little more to Kasich thoughts on global warming.
 
""He has said this several times but what is usually omitted is what is on the back-end of what he has said,"" Nichols said. ""Each time he says it he has added, ‘How big is this? I don’t know. Should we overreact to this? No.’""
 
In fact, The Hill published an article on May 2, 2012, about Kasich’s speech at the energy conference. The quote on the billboard came from that story, according to the Evangelical Environmental Network.
 
The full quote is: ""I am a believer – my goodness I am a Republican – I happen to believe there is a problem with climate change. I don’t want to overreact to it, I can’t measure it all, but I respect the creation that the Lord has given us and I want to make sure we protect it.""
 
Liles said the Federation was approached by the evangelical group and agreed to sponsor the Tampa advertisements to convince Republicans to stop viewing global warming through political lenses.
 
""We believe at the core that people don’t treat our environment as a right or left issue, it is an issue that affects all of us. It is an issue that affects our pocketbooks,"" Liles said.
 
""Whether it is addressed more through market driven means or through proposed regulatory means,"" he said, ""we believe somewhere in the middle is a road forward and they need to stop making this a partisan issue.""
 
Alexei Laushkin, of the Evangelical Environmental Network, which paid for the advertisements said his group intentionally sought out key conservative leaders to push this agenda.
 
""We in the evangelical community are tired of the politics of the issue and wanted to highlight conservatives who agree with us on this issue,"" Laushkin.
 
For the most part, Republicans have doused talk of global warming saying Democrats are pushing it to enforce more government regulations on the energy industry.
 
The Hill article notes that the Environmental Protection Agency has already begun to try to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and proposed carbon dioxide standards for new power plants to help mitigate the suspected effects of global warming. And that many scientists have long concluded climate change is real. But some Republicans have challenged the proposed EPA standards and questioned scientists conclusions.
 
""We’re hoping at the end of the day it will be a bi-partisan issue, one party can’t solve the issue so we want to highlight conservative leadership on this,"" said Laushkin.
 
Laushkin said he suspects that many Republican delegates who see the signs at the convention will be surprised.

But as far as the quote from Kasich, his own staff confirms its accuracy. As long as Kasich’s comments aren’t used as a scare tactic to get others to believe in climate change then the governor is OK with how he is being portrayed, Nichols said.

And that’s how the billboards convey the message. No scare tactics. Just Kasich saying he agrees climate change is a problem.

"['Rhode Island', 'Medicare', 'Michael Riley']","
R.I. congressional candidate Michael Riley says President Obama “cut $716 billion from Medicare.
","
It’s a big number: $716 billion.

And it has become one of the most ubiquitous -- and contested -- figures tossed around in this presidential campaign as debate swirls over the future of Medicare, the federal health
care program for seniors.

Democrats say the $716 billion represents anticipated savings in Medicare spending over the next decade, thanks to President Obama’s new health care law which, among other things, reduces Medicare reimbursements to hospitals and other providers.

Republicans from Mitt Romney on down say the $716 billion is what President Obama cut from the Medicare trust fund to pay for other reforms in the President’s Affordable Care Act.

That’s where Rhode Island Republican Michael Riley, hoping to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. James Langevin in Rhode Island’s 2nd District, comes in. (Langevin voted for the health care overhaul.)

Riley, who runs an investment advisory business, grabbed hold of some national GOP talking points when he posted this on his Facebook page this month: ""President Obama is attacking Paul Ryan on Medicare even though it is his administration with the help of Jim Langevin who cut 716 Billion from Medicare.""

PolitiFact National has on two previous occasions analyzed similar statements made by Romney and ruled them Half True or Mostly False depending on the wording of the claim. Other fact-checking organizations have come to similar conclusions. Here’s why.

Whether the verb used is ""cut"" or ""robbed"" -- Republicans have used both --  the statement would suggest to most people that Medicare benefits are in play.

While Obama indeed directed $716 billion away from future Medicare spending, the money will be used primarily to provide coverage for the uninsured under the Affordable Care Act. Democrats insist the move does not translate into reductions in benefits for millions of the elderly.

What’s being cut, they argue, is the rate of Medicare growth by, among other steps, reducing the reimbursements paid to health care providers and insurers. (Those providers and insurers went along with the lower reimbursement idea when the health care overhaul was being discussed in exchange for the likelihood of more customers under the law’s mandatory insurance provision.)

Democrats also point out that Romney’s vice presidential nominee, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, of Wisconsin, assumes the same savings in his budget proposals.

But Republicans say Democrats are missing a critical point: if providers and insurers face lower reimbursements for Medicare patients, they might start refusing to participate in Medicare. And that would limit the elderly’s access to Medicare.

A recent report by the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, raised that same point: ""The question is whether reductions in payments to health care providers will impair either access to health care services or the quality of those services. While there are some indications that providers are beginning to pull back from the program and that waiting periods for care may be increasing in some jurisdictions, it is too early to know for sure.""

The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency that estimates the impact of proposed laws, has said that if Congress overturns the Affordable Care Act now, spending for Medicare would increase about $716 billion between next year and 2022.

In an interview, Riley wouldn’t say whether he was talking about benefits being curtailed when he said President Obama ""cut"" Medicare by $716 billion.

""My meaning is it’s money that would [otherwise] go into Medicare,"" which he described as a pool of money. ""The truth is it’s too early to know.""

Our ruling

Congressional candidate Michael Riley says that with the help of U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, President Obama ""cut $716 billion from Medicare.""

Mr. Obama did direct $716 billion away from future Medicare spending as part of his health care reform law.

But calling it a cut leaves the impression that the $716 billion is being taken from money already allocated. That’s not the case.  

The debate, however, continues over whether benefits are in jeopardy. In the meantime, the Congressional Budget Office says the move eases the burden of Medicare’s current deficit.

Because the statement is ""partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context,"" we rate it Half True.

Chris Christie claims in keynote address that taxes in New Jersey “were raised 115 times in eight years”
","
In the biggest speech of his political career, Gov. Chris Christie took a moment to repeat one of the favorite lines of New Jersey Republicans:

The state raised taxes 115 times in the eight years before he took office, contributing to a loss of jobs, wealth and residents, the governor said Tuesday night during his keynote address at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla.

""When I came into office, I could continue on the same path that led to wealth and jobs and people leaving our state or I could do the job people elected me to do – to do the big things,"" Christie said.

The governor went on to say: ""But we were on a path we could no longer afford to follow. Now they said it was impossible -- this is what they told me -- to cut taxes in a state where taxes were raised 115 times in the eight years before I became governor.""

Christie’s number is about right, but the governor should have said that figure includes increases in taxes, fees and other tax policy changes. Also, as we previously found, there are many factors behind losing jobs, wealth and residents.

PolitiFact New Jersey found the same problems in October when we fact-checked a similar claim by State Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr., who said Democrats chased away jobs by ""raising taxes over 115 times"" in the past 10 years.

We confirmed that from 2002 to 2009, state officials approved roughly 115 increases in taxes and fees or other tax policy changes.

Those tax hikes included increases in the cigarette tax, the sales tax and the gross income tax. Among the fee increases was a bill passed in 2008 to increase the maximum fees for permits to manufacture, store, sell or use explosives.

But Christie also described those ""taxes"" as part of a ""path that led to wealth and jobs and people leaving our state.""

As we determined for previous fact-checks, there are many factors leading to a loss of jobs, wealth and residents. For instance, experts have pointed to the general downturn in the economy as one of the contributing factors.

Our ruling

During his keynote address, Christie claimed ""taxes were raised 115 times in the eight years before I became governor"" and those increases were part of a ""path that led to wealth and jobs and people leaving our state.""

But the governor shouldn’t have described all of those 115 increases as ""taxes."" In the eight years before he took office, state officials approved roughly 115 increases in taxes and fees or other tax policy changes.

Also, there are multiple factors behind losing jobs, wealth and residents, such as the general downturn in the economy.

We rate the statement Half True.

"['New Jersey', 'State Budget', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says he balanced a budget with an $11 billion deficit
","
Gov. Chris Christie said he faced down the impossible when he took office.

The Republican governor told an audience at the Republican National Convention during his keynote address Tuesday night that despite the doubts of naysayers, he steered New Jersey off a path that ""we could no longer afford to follow.""

""Now they said it was impossible this is what they told me to cut taxes in a state where taxes were raised 115 times in eight years. That it was impossible to balance a budget at the same time, with an $11 billion deficit.  But three years later, we have three balanced budgets with lower taxes,"" Christie said. ""We did it.""

Here, we’ll assess the governor’s claim that he balanced a budget with an $11 billion deficit.

New Jersey’s Constitution requires a balanced budget every year. Christie has met that obligation in every budget year.

The major flaw with the governor’s claim is that the deficit he cites never went away. And Christie now dismisses that deficit calculation as the ""old way of budgeting.""

The $11 billion refers to a $10.7 billion structural deficit the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Service projected for the fiscal 2011 budget year, when Christie proposed his first spending plan.

A structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same and all spending obligations required by statute were fully funded.

But the state does not have to meet all of its obligations since the budget supersedes statute.

So although a state statute may require certain levels of spending on different programs, the governor can sign a budget that does otherwise.

And that’s largely what Christie did in his first budget.
   
The governor skipped a $3.1 billion pension payment. He didn’t fully fund the school aid formula. He didn’t fully fund the state’s property tax rebate program.

And the next budget year, the state still had a projected structural deficit.

For the fiscal 2012 budget year, OLS projected a structural deficit of about $10.5 billion, nearly the same size as the previous fiscal year.

But Christie then dismissed that calculation, calling it the ""old way of budgeting.""

In a budget speech last year, Christie said the projected deficit ""assumes no one is actually managing the budget or setting priorities. That is yesterday’s New Jersey.""
   
Now, Christie said, ""the baseline is zero"" for budgeting.
 
Our ruling

Christie said naysayers said it was ""impossible to balance a budget at the same time, with an $11 billion deficit"" and ""we did it.""

The state Constitution requires a balanced budget every year and Christie met that obligation.

The deficit figure Christie cites refers to a $10.7 billion projected structural deficit, a calculation Christie uses to his advantage in his first budget year but has since dismissed as the old way of budgeting.

That’s important context Christie’s statement lacks. So, we rate this statement Half True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Artur Davis']","
Artur Davis says the health care law requires people to buy insurance ""whether they can afford it or not""
","
Back in 2008, Artur Davis was a Democratic congressman from Alabama who supported Barack Obama for president.

In 2012, he’s a Republican supporting Mitt Romney who spoke at the Republican National Convention in Tampa.

Davis used himself as an example to voters who’ve become disillusioned with Obama.

""What a difference four years make,"" Davis said, lamenting Obama’s first-term record, including his signature health care law.

""And in terms of their crown jewel legislative achievement: Who knew that when asked, ‘Could  government conceivably impose a federal mandate requiring middle-class Americans to buy health insurance whether they can afford it or not?’ That the Obama answer would be ‘Yes we can!’ ""

Here at PolitiFact, we’ve fact-checked the health care law many times. Davis’ comments struck us immediately as a misrepresentation.

The health care law does include a mandate for Americans to have insurance. But it’s not a mandate that applies whether people can ""afford it or not.""

Here’s how it works: The mandate is a tax penalty assessed on people’s income tax returns. The tax won’t affect anyone who has health insurance. The uninsured, though, will be penalized if they remain uninsured. Supporters of Obama’s health law say the penalty is intended to prod them to get health insurance, not punish them.

The law has provisions so that people with lower incomes can afford coverage. The law expands Medicaid, an existing government health insurance program for the very poor. And it gives tax credits to people of modest means to help them buy their own insurance policies.

People who earn less than 400 percent of the poverty level are eligible for tax credits that go to help them buy their own insurance. That works out to $44,680 for a single person or $92,200 for a family of four. Those income levels strike us as middle class.

Contrary to the impression Davis gave, the law does make exceptions if people can’t afford insurance.

If people have to pay more than 8 percent of their earnings for a health insurance policy (not counting their employers’ contributions or the new tax credits), they qualify for a hardship exemption. That means they would still be uninsured, but the mandate would not apply to them.

Also, people are exempt from the mandate if they don’t make enough money to have to file a federal tax return. There are also exemptions for illegal immigrants, prisoners, and people who have religious objections to health insurance.

The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care research group, explains via a graphic how the mandate functions.

We should note that there are two tricky aspects to Davis’ claim.

He says the ""middle class"" would have to buy insurance whether they could afford it or not. There is no standard definition of the middle class. Certainly many people who don’t qualify for assistance under the health care law would consider themselves middle class. And some of these same people might say that they can’t afford to spend 8 percent of their income on health insurance.

Still, Davis’ remarks at the Republican National Convention make it sound like the law is indifferent to issues of affordability. That’s hardly the case. People earning less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level would qualify for tax credits to purchase insurance. And if a health insurance policy exceeded 8 percent of income, people would qualify for a hardship exemption under the law.

"['National', 'Debt', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says there has been “$5 trillion in debt added over the last four years”
","During his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie picked up on one of the convention’s biggest themes -- that the United States is on a fiscally unstable path, with the accumulation of too much debt.

""With $5 trillion in debt added over the last four years, we have no other option but to make the hard choices, cut federal spending and fundamentally reduce the size of this government,"" Christie said.

We thought we’d check to see whether Christie’s math is correct.

We will start by noting that there are two main types of federal debt, and Christie didn’t specify which one he was referencing.

One, known as gross federal debt, includes all debt obligations of the federal government. The other -- public debt -- is a subset of gross federal debt that excludes debt owed by one part of the government to another part of the government, such as money lent by the Social Security trust fund for use elsewhere.

In the past, experts have told us that both measures have legitimate purposes, so we will look at both of these numbers without favoring one over the other.

We used a Treasury Department online calculator that tracks both measures of debt on a daily basis. Even though Christie said ""four years,"" we assumed that -- as a good Republican -- he meant to start the clock on the day Barack Obama was inaugurated, and that he did not intend to count the final four and a half months of George W. Bush’s administration.

Given this framework, how do the numbers stack up?

On Jan. 20, 2009, when Obama took office, the public debt stood at $6.3 trillion. By Aug. 27, 2012, the public debt had risen to $11.2 trillion. The increase: $4.9 trillion. That’s close enough for us to $5 trillion.

As for gross federal debt, it rose between those two dates from $10.6 trillion to $16 trillion, an increase of $5.4 trillion. By this measure, Christie’s lowballing it.

We should note that in its ratings, PolitiFact considers not just the factual accuracy of a statement, but also whether credit and blame is fairly assigned.

In this case, Christie has a point that the Democrats bear some responsibility for this debt increase, since Obama was president for the entire period and the Democrats had majorities in both chambers of Congress for two years. But the Republicans have controlled the House since January 2011, and much of the debt stems from entitlement spending policies that were set under various past presidents and Congresses of both parties. So the overall blame is fairly bipartisan.

Our ruling

Christie’s claim -- that there has been ""$5 trillion in debt added over the last four years"" -- is just about on target. His number is either slightly high or a little low, depending on the type of measurement used, and that’s actually for a period short of a full four years. His implication that Obama and the Democrats are to blame has some merit, but it ignores the role Republicans have had. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1946db8e-eefc-46db-95e4-0c5031d907e1",/factchecks/2012/aug/29/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-there-has-been-5-trillion-debt/

Rick Santorum repeats Romney claim that Obama is ending work requirement in welfare
","
When Congress passed landmark welfare reform legislation in 1996, Rick Santorum, then a Republican senator from Pennsylvania, voted for the bill.

Now Santorum is lending his voice to Mitt Romney’s campaign message that President Barack Obama has gutted that reform and done away with rules from the 1996 law that require welfare recipients to eventually get a job.

""This summer he showed us once again he believes in government handouts and dependency by waiving the work requirement for welfare,"" Santorum said Tuesday in a speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa. ""I helped write the welfare reform bill; we made the law crystal clear -- no president can waive the work requirement. But as with his refusal to enforce our immigration laws, President Obama rules like he is above the law.""

PolitiFact checked a Romney campaign ad's claim that Obama ended welfare work requirements earlier this month, rating it Pants On Fire. In reality, the Obama administration has said it will consider proposals from states that are aimed at finding better ways of getting welfare recipients into jobs. FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker have also said the claim is false.

But the claim lives on. The Romney campaign has released two more ads repeating the line that work requirements were ""gutted"" line and it's become a regular talking point for Romney campaign surrogates.

""Our most effective ad is our welfare ad,"" strategist Ashley O'Connor said at an RNC forum on Tuesday. ""It's new information.""

""We’re not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers,"" added Romney pollster Neil Newhouse.

Here, we’ll recap what Obama actually did, review the memo the Romney campaign cited to back up its claim and show why the claim is ridiculously false.

The HHS memo
   
Since 1996, welfare has been administered through block grants to states. The grant program, called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, limits how long families can get aid and requires recipients to eventually go to work. It also includes stringent reporting requirements for states to show they are successfully moving people into the workforce.
   
A memo from George Sheldon, acting assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, said the department wanted to give states more flexibility in meeting those requirements. The memo notifies states ""of the Secretary’s willingness to exercise her waiver authority ... to allow states to test alternative and innovative strategies, policies, and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families.""
   
What does that mean?
   
""If you can do a better job connecting people to work, we would consider waiving certain parts of the performance measures and use alternate measures,"" is how Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, translated the memo’s point. (The center supports the plan.)

Schott, who studies welfare policy, said TANF sets guidelines for what activities may count toward meeting the law’s work requirements: jobs, job training, internships or school, to name a few. Beyond that, it puts restrictions on how many hours a welfare client may spend at school, or how many consecutive months they can attend before that activity no longer counts toward the work requirement.
   
The result: ""States are running less-effective programs than they might be because they are so driven by performance measurement as it’s set forth in the federal law,"" Schott said.
   
Waiving work requirements, gutting reform?

The waivers, then, would allow for flexibility. For example, someone with a special-needs child might require different work arrangements than are currently allowed. Or a person who needs to improve his or her English skills might require more time to take classes.
   
""The real starting place is: What’s the most effective program to get this person to work?"" Schott said.

It’s important to note, however, that the waivers would not just be a change on paper. Schott said it’s possible that waivers will allow states to get credit under the work requirement for things that don’t count currently.

Romney and other critics contend that this amounts to ""gutting"" reform. Robert Rector, a welfare expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, wrote that the new standards set a ""very weak or counterproductive measure of success.""

But there's no evidence the Obama administration has changed its philosophy. Indeed, the goal of the policy is to boost employment. The HHS letter, in several places, says only proposals from states that ""improve employment outcomes"" will be considered.

Our ruling

Santorum said that Obama ""showed us once again he believes in government handouts and dependency by waiving the work requirement for welfare.""

The claim is a drastic distortion of what the Obama administration said it intends to do. By granting waivers to states, HHS is seeking to make welfare-to-work efforts more successful, not end them. The waivers would apply to individually evaluated pilot programs -- HHS is not proposing a blanket, national change to welfare law. And there have been no comments by the Obama administration indicating such a dramatic shift in policy.

Santorum falsely claims that Obama has waived welfare’s work requirement entirely. The remark is inaccurate and it inflames old resentments about able-bodied adults sitting around collecting public assistance.

Ted Cruz, addressing delegates, says national debt exceeds the U.S. gross domestic product

Rallying delegates at the Republican National Convention, Ted Cruz mentioned his eldest daughter to make a point about the rising national debt.

Cruz, Texas’ Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison, said the national debt -- $10 trillion when his daughter, Caroline, was born -- had spiked to $16 trillion as of today, ""larger than our gross domestic product."" (The debt was more than $9.6 trillion in late August 2008, according to the U.S. Treasury’s Debt to the Penny web page, and nearly $16 trillion as of Aug. 27, 2012).

We wondered if the debt is really bigger than the Gross Domestic Product, the marquee measure of national economic output. The government defines the GDP as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within the country.

A footnote to the prepared text of Cruz’s Aug. 28, 2012, convention speech attributes his conclusion to an Oct. 20, 2011, blog post by the Atlantic magazine suggesting the debt would surpass the nation’s GDP by the end of that  month.

We looked for what has happened since that speculation. Fortuitously, we’d started exploring this topic when Cruz aired a similar comparison during an Aug. 27, 2012, interview with Alana Rocha, a convention reporter for YNN Austin.

In a March 13, 2012, blog post, the anti-deficit Concord Coalition said the gross debt would top the nation’s GDP this year for the first time since World War II. Projections showed the gross debt continuing to increase rapidly ""as we continue to borrow and as today’s unusually low interest rates eventually rise toward their historic average,"" the group wrote.

The gross debt is best understood in two parts.

Intragovernmental debt refers to money owed by agencies within government to other agencies -- basically an internal accounting issue. An example: Social Security surpluses that the government uses for other federal operations. Such money will have to be repaid, it’s presumed, but the demand is less pressing right now and it doesn’t affect credit markets.

In contrast, public debt reflects money borrowed from outside sources -- giving it more of a connection to the economy, which is why the coalition tends to focus on it, Josh Gordon, a coalition analyst, told us by phone. ""If your problem with the national debt is that you think it’s affecting the economy or interest rates or something like that, the only part of the national debt that affects the economy is the debt held by the public. That’s where the (U.S.) Treasury is borrowing money on the open market.""

An August 2011 fact check quoted Gary Therkildsen, a fiscal policy analyst at OMB Watch, a nonprofit government-accountability group, as saying that’s why the public debt, not the gross debt, is what’s most important for understanding the government’s fiscal health. PolitiFact Ohio rated Mostly True a claim by the state’s Republican Sen. Rob Portman that the nation’s debt was equal to 100 percent of its GDP. The total debt then amounted to 97.2 percent of the GDP, while the public debt was equivalent to 66 percent of the GDP.

According to a July 27, 2010, report on the federal debt by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the ratio of the public debt to GDP had previously exceeded 50 percent once before -- during and shortly after WW II.

Gordon pointed out that the Congressional Budget Office said in its Aug. 22, 2012, update on the nation’s economic outlook that by October 2012, the public debt would reach 73 percent of GDP -- the highest level since 1950, the report said, and about twice the share that it measured at the end of September 2007, before the financial crisis and recent recession. The report says too that if deficits continue apace, ""debt held by the public would climb to 90 percent of GDP by 2022 -- higher than at any time since shortly after World War II.""

Such background in hand, we looked at Cruz’s comparison both by considering the gross debt versus the GDP and  by weighing just the public debt against it.

According to the U.S. Treasury’s Debt to the Penny web page, the gross federal debt on Aug. 27, 2012, was more than $15.9 trillion, counting nearly $11.2 trillion in public debt and nearly $4.8 trillion in intragovernmental holdings -- that money owed within the government.

The size of the U.S. economy, measured by the GDP, was more than $15.6 trillion in the second quarter of 2012, the most recent quarter for which data are available. This number comes from a chart, last revised July 27, 2012, downloadable from the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.

To ensure more of an apples-to-apples comparison, we checked the total national debt toward the end of the second quarter, at about the time the GDP was more than $15.6 trillion. The total debt as of June 29, 2012, was more than $15.8 trillion; the public debt portion was $11 trillion.

At this pass, then, Cruz’s comparison holds. Gross debt outpaces the GDP by $200 billion to $300 billion.

But the public debt was equal to about 71 to 72 percent of the GDP, depending on which public debt figure is used. The public debt has been running $4.4 trillion to $4.6 trillion behind the GDP.

Gordon said it’s questionable that the ratio of the debt to GDP means much except as a reminder that the debt continues to rise. ""Is there an economic difference in (the debt) being lower than the GDP or higher? No, there isn’t. It doesn’t make a difference,"" Gordon said. ""There is no magic line that you’ve crossed.""

Jason Pequet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, floated a slightly different interpretation, saying that while no expert knows the precise level at which debt eclipsing some threshold of the GDP will start significantly holding back the American economy, research by Harvard University economist Kenneth Rogoff and others of debt-to-GDP ratios in other countries suggests that once the gross debt exceeds about 90 percent of the GDP, economic growth starts to noticeably slow.

Pequet cautioned, though, that the United States has unique powerful advantages in that its economy is the world’s largest and the American dollar doubles as the world’s reserve currency. It’s not certain that the debt exceeding the GDP is, or will, have the same effects here as in other countries.

Summing up, he said, the relationship of debt to the GDP is not an arbitrary threshold because it ""shows the ability of your economy to pay for and finance that debt going forward.""

Our ruling

The total federal debt exceeds the nation’s economic output or GDP. However, the public debt -- borrowing that relates to the economy’s strength -- hovers below three quarters of the GDP.

Radio ad from Barack Obama says Paul Ryan ""tried to change the whole game"" on Social Security
","
A radio ad from the Barack Obama campaign attacks vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan by bringing up Ryan’s record of attempting to reform entitlement programs.

In the ad, a man and a woman are heard talking about how the GOP candidates would replace Medicare with a voucher program and increase healthcare costs. But it also implicates past ideas Ryan has proposed to reform Social Security.

""Now Mitt Romney picks a vice presidential candidate like Paul Ryan, who tried to change the whole game when it comes to Medicare and Social Security,"" the woman in the ad says.

We’ve checked many claims on Republican plans for Medicare, but what’s Ryan’s record on Social Security reform? Did he really try to change the whole game?

Ryan’s first attempts at Social Security legislation

Five years after being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, Ryan proposed the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act of 2004. It was the first of essentially three different plans Ryan has advanced in the last eight years.

Ryan’s plan was a response to projected shortfalls in the Social Security program. In 2033 or so, payouts would drop to about 75 percent of current benefits if nothing if changed. (Interestingly, Ryan is himself has received Social Security: He received two years of survivor’s benefits after his father’s death when Ryan was 16.)

His plan suggested revamping the Social Security Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program by allowing workers younger than 55 to divert some of their contributions from Social Security to voluntary personal savings accounts. The money in the accounts would be invested, overseen by the government, instead of paying for current retiree benefits.

The plan allowed workers to invest about half of their payroll taxes in their personal accounts, based on a progressive formula. At retirement, the account would convert into an annuity that paid benefits at least equal to Social Security, and potentially more, depending on how the investments performed.

Workers who never invested in a personal savings account would be provided current-level benefits, but the proposal assumed everyone would switch, since the personal accounts would give the same benefits with no risk of a reduction in payouts.

The selling point of this plan was that current benefits could be maintained through 2077 without raising taxes. But the plan required more than $2 trillion for the first 10 years of transitional funding. With people moving contributions out of the traditional Social Security program, shortfalls in traditional Social Security payouts would have to be made up by borrowing from general revenue, which is collected through income taxes.

The government would also have to make up for ups and downs in the stock market, which could affect how much the investment accounts were able to pay.

This plan died in committee in 2004. Ryan reintroduced it in 2005, but it failed to move forward again. That same year, President George W. Bush introduced a similar plan that used personal savings accounts, but the Bush proposal also proved largely unpopular both with the public and on Capitol Hill.

Ryan became ranking member of the House Budget Committee in 2007, and tried again the next year. The new plan made a number of changes to lower the costs to the government, raising retirement ages and cutting benefits for middle- and high-income workers, but protecting payments to low-wage workers. It also made employer contributions to health insurance policies taxable as a source of revenue for the program.

The 2008 plan, known as the Roadmap to America’s Future, also recommended switching Medicare to a premium support plan, giving states control of Medicaid and scaling back the amount of payroll taxes that could be invested in the accounts from one-half to one-third. It met the same fate as its predecessors, and died in committee, as it did after being reintroduced in 2010.

 Ryan’s plans with a Republican majority

Ryan became chairman of the House Budget Committee in 2011. His current Path to Prosperity budget resolution, which was introduced in 2011 and again in 2012, jettisons all mention of potential privatization, choosing instead to focus on overhauling Medicare and cutting taxes and expenditures. He has said subsequently this was to minimize political grandstanding on the part of Democrats.

""If we put a Social Security plan out there it’d be too tempting for Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi to demagogue it just like they’re doing on Medicare, running all these ‘Mediscare’ campaigns,"" Ryan said at a discussion during the Peter G. Peterson Foundation 2011 fiscal summit. ""We figured they would do that on Social Security and make it harder to get a Social Security agreement.""

The resolution suggests only that ""in the event that the Social Security program is not sustainable, the President, in conjunction with the Board of Trustees, must submit a plan for restoring balance to the fund."" This would also require the U.S. House and Senate to provide ideas for potential solutions, as well.

The House passed the non-binding budget resolution for fiscal year 2012, but it was voted down in the Democrat-controlled Senate. The current fiscal year 2013 plan, which aims to further reduce the deficit and take down Obamacare, also passed the House but not the Senate, and now serves as one of the flashpoints of the presidential campaign.

The Romney-Ryan plan for Social Security

So now that he’s a vice presidential candidate, what would a potential Romney-Ryan administration do about Social Security?

Romney has previously endorsed the Path to Prosperity, but when PolitiFact asked Romney spokesman Ryan Williams about the candidate’s plan for Social Security, he directed us to Romney’s website, which contained two points:

""First, for future generations of seniors, Mitt believes that the retirement age should be slowly increased to account for increases in longevity.

""Second, for future generations of seniors, Mitt believes that benefits should continue to grow but that the growth rate should be lower for those with higher incomes.""

The site also noted it plans ""no change in benefits for those at or near retirement.""

Romney mentions private savings accounts in his 2010 book, No Apology: The Case For American Greatness, but notes the Great Recession likely has shelved that idea for now. ""Given the volatility of investment values that we have just experienced, I would prefer that individual accounts were added to Social Security, not diverted from it, and that they were voluntary,"" he wrote.

The add-on accounts Romney mentions are a key difference from Ryan’s plan. Romney wrote he wanted the accounts to be in addition to current benefits, while Ryan has stated he wanted the accounts, which were always slated to be voluntary, to replace drawing benefits from the current Social Security Trust Fund. Now, neither Republican candidate seems to be addressing them in the campaign at all.

 The ruling

So are the Democrats correct that Paul Ryan tried to ""change the whole game"" of Social Security? It depends on how you’re scoring.

He did indeed propose a sweeping change to Social Security in 2004 and several times since. But we find it’s not quite true that he ""changed the whole game."" Even at its most ambitious, his plan did not affect people who were older than 55 and, for younger workers, the plans were voluntary and allowed workers to stay within the traditional Social Security system.

At no time has he proposed ending Social Security altogether, but that’s not exactly what the radio ad is alleging. His most recent plan is limited to a demand that the White House and Congress fix it at some unspecified point in the future.

Ryan says incomes went down nationally under Obama but went up in Massachusetts when Romney was governor
","
After distractions over social issues and tax returns dominated the run-up to the GOP convention, Paul Ryan put the focus back on Americans’ pocketbooks at a send-off rally in his hometown.

""Household income in America has gone down for families an average of $4,000 in the last four years,"" Ryan said in Janesville, Wis., on Aug. 27, 2012. ""When Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, unemployment went down and household incomes went up $5,000.""

Romney, too, has hammered on this theme, painting President Barack Obama as a failed leader in hard economic times. Ryan, like Romney before him, made clear in his speech that Obama should be held accountable for any income drop. (For clarity, we’ll exclude the unemployment claim.)

First, the history of this line of attack.

Earlier this year, PolitiFact Wisconsin looked into a claim from Romney that the median income in America had dropped by 10 percent in the last four years. At that time, the drop was $4,600 or 8.3 percent, based on a study by former Census bureau income experts at Sentier Research.

We rated that claim Half True because the figure was outdated and somewhat off the mark.

Also in June, we looked at a Romney surrogate’s claim that ""the average income for a family in Massachusetts went up by $5,500"" when Romney was governor from 2003-2007.

That also got a Half True because the dollar figure, while accurate, was not adjusted for inflation. In addition, we ruled that governors have only marginal impact on their states’ economies.

In his Janesville address, Ryan tossed the Obama and Romney records into one claim.

That’s a claim-changer, because the numbers are apples and oranges.

The declining incomes Ryan cites in the last four years were in real dollars -- inflation adjusted to show the true effect on purchasing power -- while the gains in household income under Romney were not inflation-adjusted.

Applying the ""real"" dollar analysis to the income trend under Romney, there was a drop in Massachusetts household incomes, not a $5,000 bump up, a Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation researcher told PolitiFact in June.

This week we asked Gary Burtless, a former U.S. Labor Department economist with the Brookings Institution, to check that. He found a $589 drop, about 1 percent, compared to a nationwide increase of 1.4 percent.

There’s nothing wrong with using unadjusted dollars, but economists we consulted said using real dollars is a better real-world way of gauging income trends.

And by mixing the two methods, Ryan creates a much larger gap between the 2003-2007 experience and the 2009-2012 numbers.

""It's definitely not kosher to use inflation-adjusted numbers in one case and nominal numbers in the other case,"" Daniel Mitchell, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us. When inflation is high enough to wipe away nominal gains in income, as in the Massachusetts example, ""that makes it even more important to use apples-to-apples comparisons,"" he added.

Recession role

Ryan talked about a decline in median household income ""in the last four years.""

That would reach back to mid-2008 near the end of the Republican administration of George W. Bush. The Great Recession began during the Bush era, in December 2007.

Let’s look back four years, using the Sentier Research study, which was the source used in a now-outdated Bloomberg News story that Ryan’s campaign cites to back up his claim of a $4,000 drop. (Though census data income data is the gold standard for these statistics, it has not been released for 2011 or 2012).

The Sentier data, current through June 2012, shows a $3,317 drop in median household income since June 2008. That’s a 6 percent dip.

Ryan said the decline was an ""average of $4,000,"" so he’s off going back four years.

But if you assume Ryan was informally using ""four years"" as a proxy for Obama’s term so far, it’s a $4,019 drop.

Our rating

Ryan said in a convention send-off speech that Obama deserves blame for household incomes nationally tumbling $4,000, while Romney deserves credit for incomes growing a substantial $5,000 in Massachusetts when Romney governed that state.

Earlier in the campaign, when Romney made these two claims separately, we found them partially accurate.

But when they are combined, they leave a false impression of polar-opposite trend lines because one is adjusted for inflation, while the other is not.

Applying the same inflation-adjusted methodology that Ryan chose to show the $4,000 household income drop under Obama, median incomes actually fell $589 under Romney during his earlier stint as governor.

Ryan also affixes too much blame or credit on the pair for the trends.

Jeb Bush says illegal immigration is ""net zero""
","
As millions watch them during their national convention in Tampa, Republicans are trying to appear tough on illegal immigration without offending Hispanic voters.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is bilingual and met his wife in Mexico, has warned his fellow Republicans they need to watch their tone on the immigration issue. He repeated that warning in an interview on Meet the Press the weekend before the convention.

""My personal view is that we need to get beyond where we are,"" Bush said. ""We need to create a climate of border control. And that’s begun to happen, if you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it’s net zero. It’s been that way now for almost two years. And if you say, well, we’ve gotten a much better grasp on the number of people just coming in without papers, then you could develop a strategy that’s part of economic growth. …""

For this fact-check, we will research  whether Bush was correct when he said the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country is net zero, and that it’s been that way for two years.

Pew Hispanic Center studies

We turned to the Pew Hispanic Center for an answer. The center is a nonpartisan research organization that does not take positions on policy issues.

Its 2012 report about Mexican immigration concluded, ""After four decades that brought 12 million current immigrants -- most of whom came illegally -- the net migration flow from Mexico to the United States has stopped and may have reversed."" The report was based on the center’s analysis of federal census data.

We interviewed Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at Pew and an expert on Hispanic immigration. He said that Bush’s claim is true. Passel said that we can infer that the outflow of unauthorized immigrants exceeded inflows between 2007 and 2009 because the overall size of the unauthorized population living in the U.S. decreased between 2007 and 2009 from 12 million to 11.1 million.

There are four ways the number of unauthorized immigrants changes: the inflow of new unauthorized immigrants, the outflow of those leaving the U.S., deaths and unauthorized immigrants gaining legal status.

Those last three categories -- outflow out of the U.S., deaths and conversion to legal status -- exceeded the first category of new inflows  of unauthorized immigrants by about 900,000 between 2007 and 2009. But deaths and conversion to legal status are not large figures. Therefore, Passel said, ""the major source of the decline is almost certainly an excess of outflow of unauthorized over inflow.""

You can read about Pew’s reports about net migration from Mexico here and in general about trends in the illegal immigration population here and here.

We also sent Bush’s claim to groups with opposing views on immigration and all agreed that Bush’s statement was correct.

""I think you will find everybody agrees with it being zero or close to it,"" said Roy Beck, executive director of Numbers USA, which advocates for low immigration.

A spokeswoman for The National Immigration Forum, which advocates for immigrants, sent us a New York Times op-ed piece co-written by two professors, one a former foreign minister of Mexico and the other co-director  of the Mexican Migration Project at Princeton. That op-ed piece also stated that the rate of undocumented immigration is nearing zero.

 Our ruling

Bush said ""If you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it is net zero. It's been that way now for almost two years.""

It is difficult to get a precise figure on the  population of illegal immigrants. But data from Pew Hispanic Center, a widely respected source referred to by those of different political viewpoints on immigration, supports Bush’s claim.

"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Jerry Patterson']","
Jerry Patterson says investments overseen by his office enjoyed 22 percent in earnings while state's emergency reserve earned 1 percent
","
Criticizing a poke at his not releasing millions of dollars to support public schools, Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said that doing so might cut into double-digit returns on investments managed by the General Land Office.

In a letter he made public Aug. 22, 2012, Patterson, a Republican, said that those who want him to transfer $300 million in investment earnings to the State Board of Education for school needs do not understand the value of keeping such money invested so the state’s education endowment, the Permanent School Fund, continues to gain value.

A pro-Democratic group, Progress Texas, accuses Patterson of inappropriately hoarding the millions. Patterson counters that the School Land Board, which he chairs, has discretion over whether to transfer the money and, he told us by telephone, it has until September 2013 to decide. His spokesman, Jim Suydam, also told us by email that the board approved a resolution in early 2011 to release $250 million of earnings in both 2012 and 2013 to the State Board of Education.

In his letter, Patterson said that draining off additional earnings as Progress Texas says he must is a ""bad choice... because last year the GLO-managed PSF earned 22 percent and, due to statutory liquidity requirements, the rainy day fund earned just 1 percent."" He was comparing the portion of the Permanent School Fund managed by the land office to earnings on the state’s savings account, otherwise known as the Economic Stabilization Fund. ""If your family needed a quick infusion of cash,"" Patterson wrote, ""would you withdraw cash from the investment account earning 22 percent or the account earning 1 percent?""

We’re not venturing that question, but wondered if Patterson made an accurate earnings comparison.

Starting in 2005, the land office was given the authority to invest in real estate using proceeds received from selling lands or drawing on revenue from Permanent School Fund mineral leases and royalties, the agency notes on a web page. Professional fund management firms oversee the investments, the agency says, while the land board, consisting of the commissioner and two citizen appointees, manages the sale of Permanent School Fund land and mineral leases.

To our inquiry, Suydam provided an agency report to the Legislature stating that through March 2012, the market value of the agency’s investments made from the Permanent School Fund was $3.077 billion, about half of that reflecting ""externally managed direct real estate investments"" and nearly $1.2 billion ""attributable to short-term investments"" in the state’s treasury, which Suydam later said means money set aside so it’s on call for the agency’s real estate investments.

The report, dated Sept. 1, 2012, says that gross ""time-weighted"" returns on the portfolio in the 12 months through March amounted to nearly 22.9 percent, though that is without considering the short-term investments. Counting the cash-on-call portion, the report says, the time-weighted returns on the portfolio were 13.03 percent.

""Time-weighted"" returns?

By email, Suydam told us the term describes a ""complex calculation that uses values for every day in the period being measured"" which, he said, explains why the 23 percent return shown for the real estate investments does not align with the 30 percent return that we calculated by comparing the market value of those investments at the end of March 2012 to the comparable figure at the end of March 2011.

Asked how the earnings on real estate through March 2012 compare to recent 12-month periods, Suydam said such investments generated nearly 14 percent in market value in the 12 months through March 2011, but lost about 15 percent in the 12 months through March 2010.

We checked on the rainy day fund’s earnings with Lauren Willis, spokeswoman for State Comptroller Susan Combs, who oversees state finances.

Willis said by email that money in the reserve fund, created in 1988, is invested like other funds in the state’s treasury in stable, high-quality investments. In 2011, Willis said, the average yield on all those funds was 0.74 percent -- generating nearly $194 million in interest income including $51.9 million added to the rainy day fund. R.J. DeSilva, another Combs spokesman, said by email the rate of return might or might not have been about the same through the 12 months running through March 2012.

In a telephone interview, we asked Patterson about why his letter mentions the higher returns on the real estate investments alone rather than also taking into account the lower returns influenced by the agency’s cash-on-call funds.

""I don’t count the cash,"" Patterson replied, ""because it’s not part of our investment portfolio.""

The land office, Patterson noted, is limited by law to managing just part of the overall education endowment. Suydam later said by email that as of the end of March, the market value of the agency’s portion of the PSF, not including the value of minerals or state-owned land, was nearly $3.1 billion. He said the State Board of Education oversaw the fund’s remaining $25.6 billion.

Our ruling

Patterson’s reference to 22 percent in earnings over the 12 months running through March 2012 does not account for reduced earnings from nearly $1.2 billion in cash-on-call money supporting the agency’s real estate investments. That clarification would be helpful, though it still seems reasonable, overall, to focus on the portion of the portfolio that would be expected to reap sizable gains. Separately, the claim seems to reflect the annual earnings on the rainy day fund, though the commissioner’s March-to-March time period does not match the calendar-year approach used by the state comptroller.

Teresa Fedor says Republicans supported Ohio's early voting process when it was enacted
","
With the presidential election hanging on a handful of states including Ohio, Democrats and Republicans have been fighting over the election rules and regulations governing November's election.

Ohio Democrats aren't happy with Republican efforts to limit early voting, and one of the main points of contention is a GOP-backed law that eliminated in-person early voting over the final weekend before Election Day.

Democrats sued in federal court to stop the law from taking effect, and held a news conference Aug. 15, 2012, outside the courthouse following an initial hearing.

A key argument Democrats raised is that Republicans are attempting to trim the early voting period because they are upset that President Barack Obama used early voting to help win a key victory in Ohio in 2008.

They offer as proof the fact that GOP lawmakers supported the early voting period when it was approved by state lawmakers before Obama's victory.

State Rep. Teresa Fedor, a Toledo Democrat, made that very point: ""Republicans voted for early voting and in-person voting back in 2005, signed 2006,"" Fedor told reporters. ""It seems as though they are clawing back now that we've had 95,000 or more vote in 2008.""

Did Republicans support the early voting and in-person voting when it was passed into law before the 2008 election?  

PolitiFact Ohio took a look at the record.

For the record, Republicans have said they merely are trying to rein in the costs of early voting and in-person voting for local boards of elections. They also point out that for the first time ever all Ohio voters will get an absentee ballot request form sent to them in the mail so having early voting just prior to Election Day isn't as needed as it used to be.

But for purposes of this fact check, the question is who supported the initial law changes that enacted the early voting provisions.
 
We turned to the office of Secretary of State Jon Husted, Ohio's chief elections official, and asked for information about when the early voting and in-person voting provisions became Ohio law.

Matt McClellan, a Husted spokesman, told PolitiFact Ohio that the General Assembly passed in-person voting and early voting as part of House Bill 234. The bill establishes ""no-fault"" absentee voting -- meaning that those requesting absentee ballots no longer needed to give for the request -- but ""also provides the option of voting in person at a Board of Elections or other site designated by the Board of Elections prior to Election Day,"" McClellan said in an email.

The actual language for this is found in Ohio Revised Code Sec. 3509.03. It states that ""when absent voter's ballots are delivered to an elector at the office of the board, the elective may retire to a voting compartment provided by the board and there mark the ballots.""

The bill initially passed the Ohio House on June 21, 2005. The Senate approved legislation on Oct. 18, 2005. However, the Senate substantially altered the bill in its session -- including adding the in-person early voting. The House voted to accept those changes on Oct. 19, 2005. Gov. Bob Taft signed the bill and it became law on Jan. 27, 2006.

Official accounts of each chamber's vote are kept in the Ohio House and Senate Journals and they show that the Senate vote was a party-line vote of 22-10 with all 22 Senate Republicans voting for the bill and all 10 Democrats present voting against it.

The second House vote -- after the early voting language had been added to the bill -- was 60 to 36. All Republicans were in support. All Democrats were opposed.

News accounts of the debate show that while Democrats agreed with the legislation, they were upset that the no-fault absentee provision was being passed by GOP lawmakers just weeks before Ohioans were going to the polls to vote on a proposal to expand absentee voting opportunities.

It appears as though there was no debate at the time over the provision which swung open the doors to early in-person voting.

So where does this leave us?

Fedor’s claim was that early voting and that Republicans have sought to limit was originally supported by Republicans.

That contention is backed by records from the secretary of state's office and legislative voting records. Votes in the House and Senate were cast along party lines with Republicans supporting the measure. Democrats were in opposition, citing what they said were concerns over the timing of the measure.
