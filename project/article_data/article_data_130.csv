Democrat Weems, hearkening to BP disaster, says Texas has one inspector for every 4,500 oil and gas wells
","
Seeking a seat on the Texas Railroad Commission, Houston lawyer Jeff Weems said the commission’s in charge of making sure a disaster like the BP oil spill doesn’t happen in Texas. The Democratic nominee went on to tell the United Auto Workers caucus at the party’s state convention June 25: ""Right now, there is one inspector for every 4,500 wells. You can’t do that job."" 
Understaffing in the extreme? We wondered if Weems got that right. 
In e-mails, Weems told us he heard there’s one field inspector for every 4,500 wells from Paul Whitehead, who works in a commission office in Midland. Weems said that's higher than the 1-for-3,300 ratio he got earlier from ProPublica, which describes itself as ""an independent, non-profit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest."" ProPublica published an article in December 2009 saying the Texas commission had 83 field inspectors, ""meaning each person is responsible for almost 3,300 wells, many of them requiring several visits in a year."" 
It quotes Weems saying: ""It's one of the worst-kept secrets around the state that the wells that are ostensibly checked once a year aren't. They could double the number of inspectors and still be straining their staff to do their job."" 
Whitehead referred us to the commission’s Austin headquarters where spokeswoman Ramona Nye confirmed that of late, there are 86 inspectors for 394,365 oil and gas wells, including 282,150 active wells. As of May 28, 2010, these included 740 bay and 341 offshore wells in state waters, which extend about 10 miles offshore. Overall, that makes the inspector/wells ratio about 1-to-4,586. Agency charts show the number of wells under the commission's watch is up 11 percent from Jan. 24, 2003. 
The commission’s executive director, John Tintera, told us that the commission has sought additional inspectors, with mixed results. The Legislature nixed a request for seven inspectors in 2003, he said, but in 2009 it OK’d two new pipeline inspectors and authorized four more well inspectors, contingent on revenue from fees deposited in the state's Oilfield Cleanup Fund. However, the money needed to make the hires did not accumulate. Nye said the agency hasn't decided whether to request funding for more inspectors from the 2011 Legislature. 
In an e-mail, Weems was critical of the current staffing level: ""You cannot actively monitor that many wells - there is no way you can go by, inspect what is going on - check for leaks, condition of the premises, etc., except once every 3-5 years, and then only if you fly."" The commission's spokeswoman, Nye, said inspectors drive to well sites instead of flying. 
Tintera told us every well isn’t inspected every year; instead, inspectors focus on wells where there’s greater production or environmental sensitivity. He initially indicated the commission has enough inspectors to fulfill demands: ""What Texas needs is what we have."" 
Tintera later said the commission would ""welcome more resources, including inspectors. However, we recognize the budget constraints facing the state. Therefore the RRC prioritizes its inspections, uses outriders (inspectors who work from home) located near the oil fields they inspect to maximize efficiency, and has not included inspector positions in the hiring freeze that is currently at the agency."" 
All in all? Weems accurately recaps the number of oil wells per inspector in Texas. His statement is True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/15/jeff-weems/democrat-weems-says-texas-has-one-inspector-every-/

Marco Rubio says special session is a $120,000 photo op for Charlie Crist
","
On July 8, 2010, Gov. Charlie Crist called for a special session July 20-23 for legislators to put a constitutional amendment on the November ballot to ban oil drilling near Florida's coasts.

Republican Marco Rubio, one of independent Crist's rival in the U.S. Senate race, immediately accused Crist of using the session for political gain.

Rubio wrote in a July 9 press release, ""$120,000 will be spent by taxpayers on Charlie Crist's political photo-op special session.""

Clearly, Crist will get news coverage including photo-ops out of the special session -- as will legislative leaders from both parties. But does Rubio have the dollar figure right?

Everyone we spoke to agrees it's hard to say, but $40,000 a day is the most common figure used. When Crist announced this session, The Palm Beach Post cited a $40,000 a day figure while the St. Petersburg Times wrote $50,000. Other articles simply stated ""tens of thousands a day."" 
In the archives, we found that the $40,000 figure has been quoted for decades -- as early as 1983 in the Miami Herald and 1989 in the St. Petersburg Times. Is there no such thing as inflation when it comes to special sessions in Florida?

We asked the House and Senate for the bills from some recent special sessions, and we added up the average costs for both legislative bodies to get one average cost per day. The special session in early October 2007 on budget cuts and personal injury protection for motorists cost an average of $47,924.19 per day. Another session later in October 2007 (property tax cuts) cost an average of $45,329.64. A session in January 2009 (state budget) cost an average of $46,378.71 per day. The average for those three sessions was about $46,544 per day.

Then is $46,544 a good daily average? Not necessarily. The House and Senate spokespersons, the Division of Management Services and the Office for Legislative Services all caution that those averages are imprecise. For example, they include just travel, meals, hotels and per diem. Jill Chamberlin, spokesperson for the House, says the per-diem for special sessions is $80 a day. However, lawmakers can get reimbursements instead: up to $110 a day for hotel, up to $36 a day for meals, and travel at 44.5 cents per mile or the common airline fare. The OLS calculates the length of the session differently for each body depending on what they scheduled on their calendars each day.

The averages also don't include the cost of aides. If legislators want to bring an aide -- most don't for a brief special session -- that is paid for out of their district funds, which are also taxpayer dollars. Lawmakers may come into Tallahassee the day before the session or stay overnight when it ends, which affect the costs.

Chamberlin also notes that some special sessions include committee meetings instead of floor sessions that require full attendance, so the bean-counters try to separate those costs from the special-session costs. For example, a December 2009 session on transportation was mostly committee meetings so expenses associated with the session were low: an average of $22,105.31.

We contacted the Florida Department of Management Services to ask about electricity use and other routine building costs. Do they contribute to the cost of a special session? Not really, says Linda McDonald, DMS spokeswoman, in an e-mail. She explains that the lights and the staff are there year-round. The electric bill was higher in January 2009 for the special session on the budget than in January 2008, but McDonald blames higher rates, not the special session, for most of the increase.

There probably will be minimal additional costs for the Capitol Police, but Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokesman Mike Morrison said he couldn't speculate on the amount. The police provide security to the complex year round. 
Pinpointing the average is not a simple task because there are so many variables, said Lisa Swindle, finance and accounting director for the Office of Legislative Services. But each time the OLS attempts to come up with an average, it is around $40,000, she said. Swindle said several years ago both the House and Senate appropriation bills allotted an additional $40,000 per day for each body for special sessions if they needed it, and that's likely why it's the most common figure used. She also says the one coming up will be ""a true special session,"" without deducting cost of committee meetings, so we here at PolitiFact will update those costs when the session is over. 
We asked for cost records of special sessions in the 1980s and 1990s to see why the $40,000 figure has stood up for so long. But the OLS says it doesn't have those records.

We asked Rubio's campaign where it got the $120,000 figure. Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos said the campaign had heard reports between $30,000 and $50,000 a day, and he cited a July 9 blog in the Orlando Sentinel. Even that blog states that Rubio's $120,000 figure ""is probably low.""

So where does that leave us?

When Crist announced the special session, Rubio pounced and accused him of creating a $120,000-taxpayer funded photo op for a four-day special session. Rubio was being conservative with his numbers, using the low-end of $30,000 for four days. We're going with actual average of $46,544 from three recent sessions, and adding a fudge factor for all those imprecise costs that nobody in Tallahassee seems able to pin down. Let's call it a minimum of $50,000 a day, and $200,000 if this session lasts four days. Rubio went with a logical but conservative estimate, so we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/14/marco-rubio/rubio-says-special-session-120000-photo-op-crist/

Jim McDermott says to 3 percent got majority of benefit from Bush tax cuts
","
During an interview with MSNBC host Ed Schultz, Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., took aim at a series of tax cuts enacted by President George W. Bush -- tax cuts that backers say energized the economy but which critics assailed as a giveaway to the rich.

Schultz and McDermott were discussing Republican opposition to extending unemployment benefits without reallocating money already included in the economic stimulus package passed in 2009. McDermott, like other Democrats, decried that rationale for blocking unemployment insurance, saying that Republicans have consistently supported tax cuts that benefit richer Americans.

""Those tax cuts, most of it, went to people above -- at the very top, in the top 3 percent of this country, and they simply are unwilling to be even-handed,"" McDermott said. ""Treat the workers like you treat the rich in this country, but they don't. They give to the rich and take it away from the poor, and then cluck their fingers and say, we shouldn't give you an unemployment check because you might sit at home and wait for this little check and not go out and look for a job. You can't find a job today in most parts of this country. You've got six people looking for every job that's out there, and to put the blame on the workers is absolutely wrong.""

We thought it was worth checking his claim that a majority of the benefits from the Bush tax cuts flowed to the richest 3 percent of Americans.

To do this, we looked at figures compiled by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. In one chart, the center compares how big a share different economic groups got from the series of tax cuts enacted under Bush between 2001 and 2008.

The center didn't look specifically at the top 3 percent, but it did look at the top 1 percent and the top 5 percent. The top 1 percent took 29.5 percent of the benefits, and the top 5 percent took 44.2 percent.

So if the top 5 percent took less than 50 percent of the benefits, the top 3 percent certainly didn't reach that 50 percent threshold. A rough estimate that splits the difference would be that the top 3 percent got 37 percent to 39 percent of the benefits.

""They did get a lot of the cuts, but not quite that much,"" said Bob Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.

While McDermott's 3 percent figure is wrong, it's on the right track. While the tax cuts did benefit lower-income taxpayers as well, they benefited wealthier Americans disproportionately, based both on their share of the population and their share of income. In 2009, the top 1 percent earned 16 percent of cash income and the top 5 percent earned 29.5 percent of cash income.

Indeed, if McDermott had simply refrained from citing the 3 percent figure, he would have been correct in saying that most of the Bush tax cuts went to ""people ... at the very top"" -- as long as you define the very top as the top 20 percent of earners. The top 20 percent took roughly two-thirds of the benefits from the tax cuts, according to the center's calculations.

Still, McDermott did try to bolster a reasonable argument with an incorrect figure. So we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/14/jim-mcdermott/jim-mcdermott-says-3-percent-got-majority-benefit-/

Raptakis says Mollis wrongly takes credit for small-business program
","
There have been few winners in the recession that has gripped Rhode Island these past few years. Families have struggled to pay their bills while companies scrambled to keep their doors open.

But if there was any upside, business owners say it was that state leaders finally took notice of them.

Politicians clamored to meet with them, trotting them out in public and promising to make it easier for them to do business in Rhode Island. 
The courtship culminated this spring in the unveiling of a multi-part plan intended to cut the time and headaches it takes to register businesses and get permits. Elected officials including the governor, the House speaker and the Senate president gathered on two occasions to praise their collective work. But it was Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis who garnered the greatest praise. 
State leaders applauded the secretary for proposing an online master application that requires businesses to fill out just one form and allows them to complete many registration processes online. 
Not so, says Mollis' Democratic opponent, state Sen. Leonidas ""Lou"" Raptakis. In announcing his campaign against Mollis, he declared that the program that Mollis was praised for was actually created years ago by then-Secretary of State James Langevin and was further developed through a law passed by another former secretary, Matt Brown. 
""Jim Langevin launched a First Stop Business Information Center to help small businesses cut through the red tape of having to file multiple forms with dozens of state agencies just to get started. Former Secretary of State Matt Brown built on that effort by winning passage of legislation to create a Business Fast Start office to bring state agencies together to develop a Master Business Application—one state form to replace the dozens,"" his announcement said. 
Raptakis said Mollis ignored the program for the first three years of his term, before reintroducing the proposal as his own this spring. 
Jim Langevin? Matt Brown? Did Mollis really ignore laws established by his predecessors and then take credit for them? We couldn't resist putting this one to the Truth-O-Meter test. 
State archives show that neither candidate has it quite right. 
Here's the basic history. In 2001, at the urging of then-Secretary of State Edward Inman (he succeeded Langevin, who was elected to Congress), legislators passed a law establishing a ""Business Fast Start Office."" 
The idea was to create a customer service department for businesses within the secretary of state's office. The department was also supposed to recommend ways to simplify business licensing processes and to ""develop a master application form that consolidates the information needed..."" 
Sounds a lot like what Mollis says he did. 
The unit apparently got up and running under Inman, but the master application did not. When Matt Brown was elected secretary of state in 2002, he made some progress, launching pieces of an online registration system, according to Thomas Viall, general manager of the private company that is contracted to do Internet work for the state on its ri.gov website. 
Viall recalls working on the project with Brown: ""It was kind of an experiment, doing what Secretary Mollis is now going to achieve. But it was very much a scaled down idea,"" he said. 
The site launched, but quickly hit a snag when officials realized that it would need constant (and expensive) updating any time there were changes to business regulations. A year or so after the website went public, Viall said it was already out of date and the office asked him to take it down. 
Fast forward to 2006, when Mollis ran for office. One of his campaign promises was helping small businesses. In a commentary piece written in The Providence Journal: ""I have proposed a multi-phased business program in the Corporations Division ...[it] would host a master application system, provided to cut through the bureaucratic red tape in incorporating businesses."" 
He did not mention that the law establishing the program had been put on the books years earlier. Mollis spokesman Christopher Barnett attributed the omission to space constraints. ""We only had so many words and we had to pick the ones that [were] most germane to the people who read it,"" Barnett said. 
Mollis said that soon after he took office, he reestablished the dormant fast start office and began lobbying for legislative support for the master application idea, which ultimately was approved and funded this spring. Why the delay? Mollis said it took the first three years of his administration to determine how complex and expensive the technology would be and to convince lawmakers to provide funding. 
Raptakis says Mollis' failure to voice his plans until this spring suggests he didn't have any idea in the works. But records show the secretary of state testified in favor of the master application at a Senate committee hearing on Oct. 27, 2009, identifying it as a priority for his administration. 
Mollis says he was well aware of the 2001 Inman law and it's unfair for Raptakis to suggest he was not. He acknowledges, however, that he never knew about Brown's temporary launch of the online program. Staffers who worked with both administrations never told him, he said. 
But we're not judging a Mollis statement. We're looking at what Raptakis said. While he is correct in noting that the master application idea long preceded Mollis, Raptakis never did his homework to determine the origins of the law, when it was passed, or whether it was implemented in the ensuing nine years. 
He relied instead on a June 30, 2008 statement from the Washington-based Democratic Leadership Council, which praised Brown for creating the master application (but apparently forgot to check whether it actually succeeded, which it did not). 
It is clear to us that Mollis did not give his predecessors appropriate credit for coming up with the ideas he is finally now making happen. And Raptakis was right to pick up on that. Had he focused only on that discrepancy and not on Matt Brown's and Jim Langevin's so-called accomplishments, his statement would have more credibility. But he didn't. That's why we're calling it Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/14/leonidas-raptakis/raptakis-says-mollis-wrongly-takes-credit-small-bu/
"['Florida', 'Guns', 'Charlie Crist']","
Crist stands firm on gun rights
","
Charlie Crist and ""never wavered"" are words that don't seem to naturally fit together these days. He vetoed anti-abortion legislation in June 2010 after painting himself as fiercely pro-life. He buddied up to Sarah Palin during a ""Drill, Baby, Drill"" event in 2008, then called for a special legislative session to ban oil drilling in July 2010. Most famously, he abandoned the Republican party after pegging himself as a both a Jeb Bush and Ronald Reagan Republican throughout his political career.

Yet Crist, who has been known to attribute his political flexibility to his desire to serve ""the people,"" claims there is one issue where voters can trust him to never waffle.

""Gov. Crist has never wavered in his support of the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms,"" reads the Crist for U.S. Senate campaign website.

Given Crist's serial elasticity, we wondered if this could be true. Does the so-called People's Governor actually have steady convictions about, well, something?

Crist, a St. Petersburg lawyer who was first elected to public office in 1992, quickly earned a reputation as a pro-gun candidate. In his steady rise through Florida's political strata, he continued to cultivate that image, consistently siding with gun owners.

In one of his first high-profile gun battles, Crist blasted then Gov. Lawton Chiles' last-minute effort to require criminal background checks and a waiting period for purchases made at gun shows in 1998.

""Unfortunately we're in a state that's No. 1 in violent crime in America,'' said Crist, then a state Senator. ""And for us to make moves that would disarm our law-abiding citizens would be inappropriate.""

The proposed legislation died in committee.

As Attorney General, Crist nominated former NRA President Marion P. Hammer to the state's Women's Hall of Fame. She was inducted in December 2004.

In his 2006 primary against Republican rival Tom Gallagher, who supported some gun-control restrictions, Crist put out an ad that called Gallagher ""anti-gun."" The ad concluded, ""Charlie Crist: endorsed by the NRA.""

After he won, Crist continued to highlight his Second Amendment views to trump Jim Davis, his Democratic opponent in the general election.

As governor, he appointed NRA favorites Chief Justice Charles T. Canady and Justice Ricky Polston to the Florida Supreme Court. He signed into law legislation that allowed 500,000 concealed weapons permit-holders to bring their guns to work -- as long as the weapons remained in their vehicles. 
He vetoed a move by lawmakers to take $6 million out of the trust fund that pays for licensing gun owners and processing concealed weapons permits. The national Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms rewarded his efforts by bestowing him the title of ""Gun Rights Defender of the Month"" in July 2009.

Crist then signed a bill that granted protected status to Florida's concealed weapons permit trust fund, shielding it from future raids by a cash-strapped Legislature, in a ceremony in April 2010, during which he wrapped his arms around Hammer, now the NRA's lobbyist, for a public embrace.

Most recently, Crist's campaign celebrated the Second Amendment in a Twitter message. ""Pleased w the US Supreme Court's decision today reaffirming our 2nd Amendment rights,"" he tweeted on June 28, hours after the court ruled the Second Amendment gives all Americans a right to keep and bear arms for self-defense that trumps state and local laws.

In fact, PolitiFact had a hard time finding any instance where Crist refused to back gun rights. We scanned roughly 1,000 news articles that mentioned Crist and the words ""bear arms,"" ""Second Amendment,"" and ""gun restrictions.""

The only hints we found that Crist wasn't entirely beholden to unrestricted gun rights could barely be described as so much as a flutter of indecision.

In 1993, Crist told the St. Petersburg Times he was considering supporting several proposed bills that would impose tougher penalties on youths who use guns while committing a crime. ""I believe very strongly in the right to bear arms, but I don't see a need for kids to bear arms,"" except for hunting or target shooting with supervision, said Crist, newly elected to the state Senate. The NRA gave some of the proposed bills its blessing.

In another instance, Crist bucked the NRA when he appointed Justice James Perry, a self-professed gun advocate who never convinced the NRA of his loyalty, to the Florida Supreme Court in 2009. But gun leaders say the appointment was an unnoteworthy misfire. They did not hold it against Crist.

""He has always throughout his career been a strong advocate for the Second Amendment and the rights of law-abiding gun owners and sportsmen, never voted against us, always voted with us as governor,"" Hammer said. ""He signed every piece of legislation gun owners asked him to sign and vetoed every piece of legislation negatively impacting gun owners and sportsman that gun owners asked him to veto. He has an outstanding record of support.""

Hammer said Crist earned an ""A"" rating as a political newcomer, the highest grade bestowed to a rookie candidate by the NRA, and subsequently received an ""A+"" in future years based on his voting record.

""You can't get an 'A+' unless you have a strong history on our issues,"" Hammer said.

Joe Waldron, director of the Citizens Committee to Keep and Bear Arms, also said that Crist's support for gun rights has remained steadfast.

However, a budding effort to cast doubt on Crist's pro-gun record has begun to emerge.

Crist recently indicated he would confirm President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Elena Kagan, if elected to the U.S. Senate, drawing mixed responses.

Hammer said she continues to trust Crist. Neither Hammer or the NRA has endorsed a candidate in the Senate race yet.

""I was told he had a made a comment about Kagan before he knew her record and before he knew of our opposition,"" she said. ""We would not be pleased with anyone who would vote to confirm Elena Kagan. We have made that very clear."" 
The Florida Republican Party used the statement in another round of attacks against its former leader.

""Floridians believe in the Second Amendment, and we need a United States senator who will defend that right when given the responsibility of confirming justices who could influence the rulings of the Supreme Court for generations,"" Chairman John Thrasher said in a June 2010 press release. ""The reality here is about more than politics. If activist judges like Elena Kagan gain control of the Supreme Court, our individual right to bear arms for personal protection could cease to exist in this country. Does Charlie Crist still think she’d do a great job?""

Republican spokesman Katie Betta elaborated in an email interview: ""Our main point with this release was to highlight the fact that when the Governor was trying to win the Republican Primary, he opposed the confirmation on Justice Sotomayor because of her record on the Second Amendment, now he said he thinks Kagan will do a great job, despite the fact that she has such a controversial record on the Second Amendment. His position is ever-changing in that it changes based on his political needs, rather than based on principles.""

To be sure, Crist is no Charlton Heston. He isn't even a Palin, for that matter. He doesn't stalk across the state clutching a rifle or claim to kill his own dinner.

But his standing with the NRA is bulletproof, at least for the time being.

We rate this True.

Fort contends his opponent is a Republican in Democratic clothing
","
It doesn’t get much nastier than this in Fulton County politics.

State Sen. Vincent Fort (D-Atlanta) finds himself under a withering political assault from upstart Graham Balch, a 36-year-old biology teacher at Grady High School, a former Peace Corps volunteer, a Barack Obama supporter and a man who has the backing of some true heavyweights in the Atlanta business community.

A renegade in the state Legislature who has never shied away from confrontation, Fort now finds himself in a fierce, under-the-radar firefight to save the District 39 Senate job he has held for 14 years. 

It just might be the biggest battle in Georgia this year for a legislative seat held by an incumbent. But there have been no debates or even joint appearances by Fort and Balch. This fight to the finish is being played out in direct-mail broadsides and so-called robo attacks (recorded telephone calls).

Senate District 39 runs from East Point in the south up through Midtown and into Buckhead. It includes portions of southwest Atlanta. It’s a diverse district with a majority black (62 percent) population. It contains some of Atlanta’s richest and poorest neighborhoods.

And it’s always been a sure win for Democrats. 

That will be the case again this election cycle. Fort and Balch are the only candidates running. And they have both signed up as Democrats.

But there’s a twist, at least according to Fort. The veteran politician and college history professor contends Balch is not much of a Democrat at all. 

In a mailer sent to District 39 residents, and in subsequent media interviews, Fort argued that Balch is little more than a Republican masquerading as a Democrat. That’s a politically incendiary charge in District 39. 

One Fort mailer has a photo of Balch on the front. Below are photos of three elephants doing tricks with GOP stickers on their bodies. The headline reads: ""How Republican is Graham Balch? The headline on the other side reads: ""Graham Balch. Too Republican to stand up for us.""

It’s a point Fort has continued to hammer home to supporters and reporters.

""He’s a Republican in Democratic clothing,"" Fort said in an interview with PolitiFact Georgia. 

Rubbish, Balch said. He accused Fort of twisting the facts to smear him. 

""I am 100 percent a Democrat, and I’m very proud of that."" Balch said. 

But is Fort correct? Or is the veteran lawmaker and political firebrand simply playing the party card to discredit the only real challenger he has faced in more than a decade?

Fort stands by his mailer. 

""He worked for a Republican congressman and he voted in the Republican primary,"" Fort said. ""That makes him a Republican.""

Balch agreed with Fort that he did intern for a Republican congressman while working on his thesis about the GOP’s impact on environmental policy. He interned for then U.S. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a moderate Republican from New York known for his environmental activism. 

And Balch said he did vote in the 2000 and 2004 GOP primaries in Pennsylvania, where he lived at the time. But he did so, Balch said, to cast a write-in protest vote against George W. Bush. 

Georgia voters, unlike those in Pennsylvania, do not register by political party.

""I have done some protest votes against Bush because I think he stole the 2000 election (both in winning the Republican nomination and the general election) with dirty politics, and because I consider him the worst president in U.S. history,"" Balch said. ""That protest vote is why I am listed that way in Pennsylvania.""

A review  of voting records in Pennsylvania shows Balch is listed as ""Republican"" and ""inactive.""

There is no independent way to determine why Balch voted in the Pennsylvania GOP primary. So PolitiFact Georgia sought more recent records. 

We went to VoteBuilder, which touts itself as a ""partnership between the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Georgia."" It’s an effort to identify and target people who consistently vote for Democrats. VoteBuilder gives Balch an 83 percent rating as a Democrat. It places him in its ""strong Democrats"" category.

Balch is also an elected member of  the Fulton County Democratic Party, according to its Web site. He holds Seat 2 in House District 59.

Fort is unimpressed. 

""A corpse could get elected to that position,"" Fort said. ""It’s a social club.""

A check of financial contribution records also shows Balch has given money to Georgia Win List, a group that backs female Democratic candidates. And he specifically contributed to the campaign of state Rep. Margaret Kaiser, a Democrat from Atlanta. There was no indication he has ever contributed to Republican candidates. 

The Fort-Balch race has taken on some of the overtones of last year’s slugfest between Kasim Reed and Mary Norwood for mayor of Atlanta. That race was nonpartisan, but Reed’s camp accused Norwood of being too cozy with Republicans. Reed narrowly won the hard-fought contest.

""He’s saying to himself, ‘Hey, this worked for Kasim Reed against Mary Norwood, so let’s try it again,’ "" Balch said in a telephone interview with PolitiFact Georgia.

Reed has endorsed Fort and held a fund-raiser for him, spokeswoman Sonji Dade said. Fort was a staunch supporter of Reed in the mayoral race.

Fort has repeatedly said that Balch’s contributors are Republican. But a check of those records indicates they come from both political camps, many of them with strong ties to the business community.

Fort accuses the business community of trying to run him out of office because of his aggressive stand against the privatization of Grady Memorial Hospital. He was a frequent vocal critic of the move. And Fort was even hauled away in handcuffs after he disrupted one Grady board meeting. 

Contributors to Balch’s campaign include Metro Chamber of Commerce President Sam Williams, former Cousins Properties CEO Tom Bell and Lisa Borders, a former president of the Atlanta City Council who is now president of the Grady Foundation.

""The good ol’ boys are out to get me,"" Fort said during a recent telephone interview with PolitiFact Georgia.

Fort would have been correct if he had said Balch is strongly backed by Atlanta’s  business community.

But the state senator appears to be on shaky ground accusing his opponent of being a Republican.

We give Fort a Barely True on this one. ",/factchecks/2010/jul/14/vincent-fort/fort-contends-opponet-republican-democratic-clothi/

White: In Perry's Texas, we import nurses
","
What do nurses and welders have in common? According to Bill White, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, those are two jobs in the state that foreign workers fill. 
During his June 25 speech to delegates at the Texas Democratic Party convention in Corpus Christi, White said the values of his Republican opponent, who has been governor for more than 10 years, are out of step with Texans’, saying: “Rick Perry’s Texas is different than our Texas. ... In Rick Perry’s Texas, we import nurses and welders from other countries.” 
We’ll leave welders for another day. In this article, we’re checking the nurses’ element. 
Katy Bacon, White’s spokeswoman, said the hiring of foreign nurses shows the state has failed to educate enough Texans for the jobs. That's a Perry issue “since he's the leader of state government, and the primary function of state government is education,"" Bacon said. ""The buck stops at his desk.” 
Bacon backed White's statement about Texas importing nurses by pointing to the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses, taken every few years by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration. The latest study, completed in 2004, had Texas among six states employing the bulk of the nation’s foreign-educated registered nurses. The leader was California (28.6 percent), followed by Florida (10.7 percent), New York (10.4 percent), Texas (7.5 percent), New Jersey (6.9 percent) and Illinois (5.6 percent). 
The survey found that the majority of the nation's foreign-educated nurses went to school in the Philippines, Canada or the United Kingdom. 
Based on a sample of nurses -- not a head count -- the report estimated that in 2004, Texas had 6,738 registered nurses who had attended foreign nursing schools. 
Counting licensed nurses, the Texas Board of Nursing put the number significantly higher: It said 20,048 internationally educated registered nurses were eligible to work in Texas in 2004. The number increased more or less steadily from 18,358 in 2000 to 24,483 in 2009, when they accounted for 11 percent of the state's 219,458 registered eligible nurses. News reports from the early 2000s confirmed that Texas hospitals were recruiting nurses from abroad to help fill their staffs. 
That's not new. Clair Jordan, executive director of the Texas Nurses Association, said foreign-trained nurses were even more prevalent decades ago. From the 1960s through the 1980s, she said, as many as 30,000 foreign-trained nurses may have been hired to work in Texas. Jordan said very few Americans go overseas for training. 
In the past few years, said Jordan, the nursing pinch has been eased somewhat by the economic downturn (which reduced job turnover as some nurses put off retirement or worked more hours) and an increase in graduates from the state’s nursing schools. Federal visa restrictions have also hampered foreign recruitment, said Amanda Engler, a spokeswoman for the Texas Hospital Association. 
What's been state government's role in all this? 
In 1999, the year before Perry became governor, the Texas Nurses Association joined with other organizations to address the nursing shortage, according to a report written in 2008 and updated this year by the Texas Team -- 10 state, industry, higher education and legislative leaders selected by the governor's office. Among the concerns raised by the coalition: Too many qualified applicants were being turned away from the state's nursing programs, mainly because the schools lacked the resources to train them. Graduating more nurses was one of the group's legislative goals. 
Since 2001, the Legislature has appropriated more than $100 million to tackle the nursing shortage, according to the nurses association. Enrollment in registered nursing programs increased 62 percent from 2001 to 2009 and graduates increased 81 percent, according to the Texas Center for Nursing Workforce Studies and the Texas Board of Nursing. 
What has Perry done? Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for the governor’s campaign, said Perry “has led the charge to improve the nursing shortage and nursing education in Texas.” We found five examples, from 2002 to 2010, of Perry citing the shortage in speeches and endorsing efforts to help expand the educational system. 
Under “Nursing Education Efforts” on his office's website, Perry touts several legislative actions, starting with the Professional Nursing Shortage Reduction Program, which he signed into law in 2001. The legislation, authored by then-Sen. Mike Moncrief, D-Fort Worth, established grant programs for nursing schools to increase student enrollment and retain faculty members. 
Elizabeth Sjoberg, associate general counsel for the Texas Hospital Association, told us Perry “has supported initiatives to address the nursing shortage for a number of years.” Sjoberg noted that Perry’s wife, Anita, is a former nurse. 
Despite the improvements, Sjoberg said, Texas still has catching up to do. In a 2010 report, the Texas Center for Nursing Workforce Studies said that by 2020, Texas will be short about 70,000 full-time registered nurses as the state continues to grow, its population ages and older nurses retire. The center said that to meet the demand for registered nurses by 2020, the number of graduates will need to triple from the 2009 level, when 8,211 people graduated. 
Texas nursing schools are still turning away qualified applicants -- about 8,700 in 2009, primarily because the schools lack sufficient faculty, the center reports. 
Upshot: White is correct that Texas imports nurses from abroad. But implying that Perry is to blame for that disregards the governor's efforts to address a shortage that existed before he became governor, and has persisted despite efforts by the state to produce more Texas-trained nurses.

Gillespie touts Bush record on taxes, job creation
","

On the July 11, 2010, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, Republican strategist Ed Gillespie sought to contrast favorably economic performance under President George W. Bush to that under President Barack Obama.

Gillespie -- a former top aide to Bush -- said ""the fact is, under the Bush tax cuts, we did have 52 months of ... uninterrupted job creation, longest in the history of the country, and revenues were at an all-time high in 2007. The problem wasn't lack of revenue. The problem still remains today too much federal spending, and this administration's not addressing that.""

We thought it would be worth checking two of Gillespie's claims.

• Did Bush preside over 52 months of uninterrupted job creation? Close, but not quite.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy added more jobs than it lost during 50 out of 52 months between September 2003 and December 2007. The economy lost jobs over two months during that stretch -- between June 2007 and July 2007 (20,000 jobs) and between July 2007 and August 2007 (71,000).

That falls slightly short of being ""uninterrupted."" Gillespie would have been correct if he'd said that jobs grew for 46 consecutive months.

We might add that over the course of Bush's presidency -- a total of 96 months -- the economy created 1.08 million jobs. That may sound like a lot, but compared to every other post-World War II president prior to Obama, it's the lowest average annual percentage increase in jobs created. (See our calculations here.) 
That said, Obama's figures are worse than any of his postwar predecessors'. The economy has shed between 2.4 million and 3.1 million jobs during the 18 months he's been in office, depending on whether you start counting with the January 2009 figures or the February 2009 figures.

• Were revenues at an all-time high in 2007? Strictly speaking, yes.

According to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, total federal tax receipts hit $2.57 trillion in 2007, before declining in 2008 and 2009, when the current recession was under way. (Tax revenues almost always sink during a recession.) The 2007 level was the highest recorded since 1934, when statistics were first collected.

So on that score, Gillespie's right. But using this particular statistic neglects a key factor -- the size of the economy as a whole. Though recessions and expansions produce volatility in tax collections, as do changes in tax policy, one would expect that a bigger economy would generally produce greater tax revenues than a smaller one. And indeed, in the 57 tax years between 1951 and 2007, tax collections grew 49 times on a year-to-year basis -- a consistent trend despite frequent changes in tax rates and periodic recessions.

You can easily factor out the size of the U.S. economy if you divide revenue by gross domestic product, or GDP. The Tax Policy Center has also calculated these numbers.

In 2007, tax revenues represented 18.5 percent of GDP. That's high by historical standards but hardly a record. It only ties for 16th place going back to 1934, and within the 14-year stretch between 1996 and 2009 it only rises to 7th place.

So if Gillespie's point is that Bush's tax cuts led to record revenues, they did -- for 2007 at least -- but that was a record aided by a the largest, non-recession economy in American history.

Ultimately, Gillespie two comments are generally accurate, but they would have benefited from some additional historical context. We realize that this is not always possible during a fast-paced television show, so on balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/14/ed-gillespie/gillespie-touts-bush-record-taxes-job-creation/
"['National', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Workers', 'David Axelrod']","
Republicans supported unemployment insurance under Bush
","
Congress has been unable to agree how to boost the economy, creating headaches for President Obama and his Democratic Party.

Obama adviser David Axelrod took questions on the issue from Jake Tapper on ABC News' This Week. ""How can the president create jobs without there being any willingness on Capitol Hill to spend money to do so?"" Tapper asked.

Axelrod agreed there is ""not a great appetite"" for additional spending in Congress.

""But I do think there are some things we still can accomplish. I do think that we can get additional tax relief for small businesses. That's what we want to do, additional lending for small businesses. They're an engine of economic growth. We're hoping we can persuade enough people on the other side of the aisle to put politics aside and join us on that. (And) unemployment insurance, we ought to extend unemployment insurance. People are suffering,"" Axelrod said.

""You can't get the votes, though,"" Tapper interjected.

""Well, we'll see. We'll see,"" Axelrod said. ""But at a time when there's one job vacancy for five unemployed workers looking for jobs, clearly we have a responsibility to do it. The Republicans met that responsibility each time under President Bush, when he asked to extend unemployment insurance. They ought to do it now. Let's not play politics with this issue.""

We were intrigued by Axelrod's statement that Republicans helped President George W. Bush pass extensions for unemployment insurance. So we decided to fact-check it. 
A little background on unemployment insurance: When workers lose full-time work through no fault of their own, they are usually eligible for unemployment benefits, small weekly payments intended to partially make up for lost wages. Employers pay taxes to fund the program, and states administer it based on federal guidelines. How much a person gets and how long benefits are paid varies by state. Usually, the benefits last about six months.

In tough times, though, Congress often extends benefits, because of the difficulty of finding new jobs when unemployment is very high, as it has been since 2008, when the economy floundered. As a result, Congress has been arguing this summer about extending benefits again after extending them five times since Obama took office in 2009. Recent extensions have been structured so that workers in states where unemployment is higher receive additional weeks of benefits. In the states where unemployment is highest, some unemployed workers have been paid benefits for close to two years.

But the extensions have run out for some workers, and Congress has been unable to agree on whether to extend them again. That's the context in which Axelrod commented that Republicans extended unemployment for Bush ""when he asked.""

We found several instances of President Bush signing into law unemployment insurance extensions. Some extensions were highly targeted, such as aid to airline workers after 9/11 and to victims of Hurricane Katrina. But Bush signed two general extensions in 2003 for 13 weeks each, with significant Republican support. He also signed extensions in 2008 with Republican support.

We were unable to find any instances when Bush asked for an extension of unemployment benefits and Congress refused him. None of the experts we consulted could recall such a case. So Axelrod was technically right that Bush appears to have gotten Congress to extend unemployment insurance ""when he asked.""

But in reviewing news articles on unemployment during the Bush administration, we noticed that, even when they supported extending benefits, Bush and Congressional Republicans were generally more skeptical than Democrats were. We noted that Republicans said then the same thing that some conservatives say now, which is that unemployment payments are a disincentive in some cases to taking a new job. Economists have noted this effect in studies, but they say that it is more significant during normal economic times.

Axelrod's comment implies that Republicans were willing to extend unemployment insurance under Bush but are balking now that Obama is president. But we find the employment landscapes under Bush and Obama so different as to defy comparison. Extensions under Bush usually were for fairly short periods of time, such as two 13-week extensions in 2003. 
Also, some Republicans want the current extension combined with other spending cuts, to prevent the deficit from getting bigger. Projected deficits now are much larger than they were under Bush. Finally, it's worth noting that some reports indicate the unemployment legislation has failed to gain Republican support because Democrats have combined it with other measures. 
While Axelrod is right that Republicans supported Bush's proposals to extend unemployment benefits, it's important to note that there are differences between then and now. So, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/13/david-axelrod/republicans-supported-unemployment-under-bush/

Sharron Angle flip-flops on BP oil spill 'slush fund'
","
Sharron Angle, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Nevada, was a guest on a radio show recently when a caller expressed surprise that the government could pressure oil company BP to create a ""slush fund"" to pay claims. 
Angle agreed. ""No, government shouldn""t be doing that to a private company, and I think you named it clearly. It""s a slush fund,"" she said during the appearance on the Alan Stock News Show on KNXT radio in Las Vegas on July 7, 2010.

As you may recall, Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, used similar language last month. Apologizing to BP for what he called a ""shakedown,"" he also referred to the $20 billlion as a slush fund. 
But other Republicans, including House Minority Leader John Boehner, promptly distanced themselves from his remarks.

 ""I have said from the beginning that BP ought to be held responsible for every dime of this tragedy. And they ought to be held accountable to stop the leak and get it cleaned up as soon as possible,"" said Boehner.  ""BP agreed to fund the cost of this cleanup, and I'm glad they're being held accountable."" 
Barton then apologized for his apology, saying that he believed BP should be held accountable for the accident. 
Angle's comments came a month later, but it didn""t take long for her to distance herself from her own remarks. By the close of business the next day, Angle""s campaign issued a statement entilted ""Setting the record straight about BP and the Obama Administration.""

""Having had some time to think about it, the caller and I shouldn""t have used the term ‘slush fund""; that was incorrect,"" said the ""Statement from Sharron Angle.""

""My position is that the creation of this fund to compensate victims was an important first step -- BP caused this disaster and they should pay for it.

"['National', 'Pundits', 'Stimulus', 'This Week - ABC News', 'George Will']","
Will: Obama said stimulus would cap unemployment at 8 percent
","On ABC's This Week on July 11, 2010, host Jake Tapper played a video of a recent speech by President Barack Obama in which he mocked Republicans for ""peddling the same old snake oil that they've been peddling for years.""

Tapper said it appeared Obama was trying to frame the midterm elections as a choice between Democrats and Republicans rather than a referendum on the administration. Tapper asked conservative columnist George Will if he thought Obama's strategy would work. ""No,"" Will said, ""because he (Obama) is an expert on snake oil. This is the man who said if we pass the $767 billion stimulus bill -- which it turns out cost $862 billion, a $95 billion oops  -- we would have unemployment at 8 percent and no higher. And it went higher."" This is a claim with staying power. In fact, we first dealt with a similar claim a little more than a year ago when House Republican Whip Eric Cantor said, ""We were promised. The president said we would keep unemployment under 8.5 percent (if the stimulus passed)."" Since then, it has become frequent conservative talking point -- cited repeatedly by Fox's Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck and others. So we thought it was worth revisiting. First, we could find no instance of anyone in the administration directly making such a public pledge. Rather, it comes via a Jan. 9, 2009, report called ""The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan"" from Christina Romer, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser.

Their report projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would create 3 million to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009.

As Will rightly noted, it went higher. The unemployment rate peaked around 10 percent in late 2009 and is now around 9.5 percent. And Will is also right that the cost of the stimulus rose dramatically.

But what we saw from the administration in January 2009 was a projection, not a promise. And it was a projection that came with heavy disclaimers.

""It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error,"" the report states. ""There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.""

There's also a footnote that goes along with the chart that states: ""Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action.""

The administration has acknowledged its projections were wrong.

In a July 2, 2009, interview, Romer said on Fox: ""None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January. I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated.""

Indeed, in January 2009, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher — 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus.

So, is the fact that unemployment rose even as the stimulus unfolded proof that it has failed? White House officials have steadfastly maintained that the stimulus is working, that even though the unemployment rate has risen above where it was projected in January 2009, it would be even worse if not for the stimulus.

That was the gist of Obama's claim in a town hall meeting on the economy in Racine, Wis., on June 30, 2010.

""Now, every economist who has looked at it has said that the recovery did its job,"" Obama said. ""It put a brake on the collapse of the economy. We avoided a Great Depression. We are now growing again. The problem is, No. 1, it’s hard to argue sometimes, things would have been a lot worse. Right? So people kind of say, yeah, but unemployment is still at 9.6. Yes, but it’s not 12 or 13, or 15.""

That comment was ridiculed by the Daily Show's Jon Stewart who commented, ""I believe we can all agree as Americans there are many numbers bigger than nine.""

Obama is correct that many independent economists agree that the stimulus has created more than a million jobs and kept the unemployment rate from going even higher than it has (though in fairness, not every economist agrees with that).

But there is an inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting. And how can you ever prove that if the unemployment rate got to X percent, it would or would not have gotten a point or two higher if not for the stimulus? The same holds true for Republicans who say the rising unemployment rates prove the stimulus isn't working. Again, it's difficult to empirically prove whether they're right or wrong.

Will didn't use the word ""promise"" as Cantor did when we checked the same claim a year ago, but the meaning is the same, that Obama was offering some sort of guarantee the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had ""significant margins of error"" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is ""unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity."" In short, it was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not  a take-it-to-the-bank pledge of an upper limit on unemployment.           So we find Will's claim Barely True.     
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2010/jul/13/george-will/will-obama-said-stimulus-would-cap-unemployment-8-/

John Thrasher takes credit for pushing Jim Greer out of RPOF
","October 18, 2010, is the day disgraced former Republican Party of Florida Chairman Jim Greer will stand trial on charges that he funneled funds from the RPOF into his own private ventures. As that trial nears, and the August statewide primary elections loom, there’s been plenty of political posturing around his case -- with party leaders trying to distance themselves from Greer or showcase themselves as the ones who pushed for his ouster.

On July 1, 2010, after Greer’s trial date was set, Rick Scott, who is running against Attorney General Bill McCollum to be the Republican candidate for governor, called for an independent investigation into Greer’s mismanagement, arguing there was a conflict of interest with having the Attorney General’s office handle the investigation.

""His back-room-deal mentality is out of step with voters who are demanding accountability and openness,"" Scott said about McCollum in a press statement.

Scott’s statement prompted the current RPOF chairman John Thrasher, a state senator from St. Augustine, to fire back with this response: ""Attorney General McCollum, Speaker-Designate Cannon, Senate President-Designate Haridopolos and I stood up to Governor Crist and worked to remove Jim Greer as Chairman because of his mismanagement of the party.""

We decided to look further into Thrasher’s claim. Is it true that these four men ""worked to remove Jim Greer?""

When we turned to the Republican Party of Florida, which distributed Thrasher’s statement in a press release, they referred us to various news articles detailing Gov. Charlie Crist’s support and close ties to Greer, his hand-picked choice for chairman after Crist’s own election in 2006. Greer was an Oviedo city council member and regional leader of Crist's campaign. Tying Greer to Crist, though, doesn’t address which party leaders had pushed for Greer’s ouster. So we decided to look back and see where and when there were reports that the four high-profile Republicans pushed for his ouster.

But first a little background on what led to Greer’s removal.

Greer was forced out early in 2010, after complaints arose of lavish spending on party-issued credit cards and Republican donors and the media started to call for the release of the credit card statements. Nearly $7.3 million is reported to have been spent for the three years that Greer served as party chairman from 2006 to 2009.

When Thrasher took over as party chairman in February, he ordered an audit of RPOF finances. A subsequent investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement showed Greer and Delmar Johnson, an RPOF staffer, had formed a consulting company, Victory Strategies, that was paid a 10-percent commission on money raised for the party. According to FDLE’s arrest affidavit, Victory Strategies funneled $125,000 from the party. Johnson kept $65,000 with the rest going to Greer.

Now back to the question at hand: Did Thrasher, McCollum, Cannon and Haridopolos work to remove Jim Greer?

Under growing pressure from party leaders, and with a state investigation by the FDLE pending, Greer voluntarily stepped down from his post on Jan. 5, 2010. We looked at media reports before and after Greer left, to see if and when the four Republicans mentioned by Thrasher started to publicly complain about Greer’s practices.

Aug. 23, 2009 -- Haridopolos voluntarily gives back his party-issued credit card after initial reports of high spending by some cardholders, according to an Orlando Sentinel report.

Dec. 18, 2009 -- Fifty party leaders call for Greer’s resignation. The same day, Greer tells the St. Petersburg Times that Crist ""has told me I'm not to consider resigning.""

Dec. 26, 2009 -- Hillsborough County Republican Chairwoman Deborah Cox-Roush, in a long letter to the state executive committee, notes that Cannon and Haridopolos ""refused to comment publicly"" about Greer’s future, a signal he had lost their support.

Dec. 29, 2009 -- The St. Petersburg Times called it ""the biggest shoe to drop yet"" when a dozen major GOP fundraisers called on Greer to resign.

Jan. 5, 2010 -- Greer steps down in a hastily organized teleconference. That same day Cannon transfers $550,000 from the party’s account into his political action committee, the Florida Liberty Fund. A political strategist hired by Cannon tells the Orlando Sentinel that Cannon had requested the transfer earlier, citing lost faith in how Greer was spending the money.

Jan. 7, 2010 -- Just before the party meets to select a new chairman, Senate President Jeff Atwater, R-North Palm Beach, adds Thrasher as a member of party executive committee.

Feb. 11, 2010 -- As reports detailing party finances come out, McCollum issues a campaign press release stating his ""outrage over recent revelations of extravagant contracts and lavish spending."" He adds: ""If audit findings suggest potential criminal activity, I will assist the state Executive Committee in directing these findings to the appropriate law enforcement investigatory agency."" The Orlando Sentinel describes McCollum as ""a driving force"" in ousting Greer. 

Feb. 20, 2010 -- With Thrasher now elected as RPOF chairman, he tells members gathered for a general meeting that his ""first order of business"" is to call for a internal audit of the state party’s finances, according to a St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald story. State Sen. Paula Dockey, R-Lakeland, a McCollum rival for governor at the time, criticizes McCollum for being slow in responding to the Greer issue. A St. Petersburg Times blog also says McCollum, ""like other Republican legislative leaders, long brushed off criticism of Greer's management and pleas that he help oust Greer.""

April 1, 2010 -- Greer files a lawsuit against the state party and Thrasher as party chairman, claiming they reneged on a secret severance package that would have paid Greer about one-year’s salary, nearly $124,000. The lawsuit also claims that Cannon and Haridopolos allegedly offered to pay Greer $200,000 in ""hush money,"" to remain quiet about the severance agreement. Thrasher, Cannon and Haridopolos’ signatures appear on the secret deal, although not all on the same page, indicating their active involvement in the negotiations. The party, in response, says the severance agreement is not an enforceable contract, according to the St. Petersburg Times. 

June 2, 2010 -- The Florida Department of Law Enforcement announces they have opened an investigation into Greer’s spending practices.

And that’s the tale of Greer’s fall. Thrasher has put much of the blame on Crist, for putting Greer in power and not curtailing his spending. Crist, who initially stood by Greer saying he was doing a ""good job,"" has since said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" by Greer’s actions.

Still Thrasher continues to pounce on Crist and the close relationship he shared with Greer.

""The governor's the guy that pretty much placed Chairman Greer in the position he did,"" Thrasher said in an April 22, 2010, interview with the Tallahassee press corps.

Much of the pressure and negotiation to remove Greer took place internally, and the ""four horsemen,"" as Greer called them in his lawsuit, are not laying out their individual machinations. But it’s apparent these four party leaders were the ones who had to act after fundraisers and county chairmen rebelled against Greer. Attorney General McCollum, Speaker-Designate Cannon and Senate President-Designate Haridopolos were top elected party leaders. Thrasher became a key player by virtue of his quick selection to replace Greer.

Regardless of the behind-the-scenes nature of their attempts, the four politicians have been the most visible in their attempts to get Greer out of office. And they acted in the face of initial support for Greer from Gov. Crist, who at the time was still the nominal head of the party.

Gov. hopeful John Oxendine said heath care unconstitutional
","Republicans vying for governor took the opportunity during Sunday's televised debate to bash massive federal health care changes. The bill, signed by President Barack Obama in March, is unpopular among state Republicans. Predictably, none of the candidates liked it. But one statement made on the Fox 5 program by front-runner John Oxendine made us curious, especially since the legislation is chock-full of stuff people on both sides of the aisle find murky: ""To say a family has to buy a product from a private company is clearly beyond the delegated powers of the U.S. Constitution,"" he said. But are they required to buy it? And does the law violate the U.S. Constitution?First, a little history. After the Democrat-backed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed, critics, especially Republicans, complained that it's unconstitutional for a number of reasons, including that it makes people buy health insurance. States banded together to file suit against the federal government in March.Gov. Sonny Perdue hoped to join them, but state Attorney General Thurbert Baker, a Democrat who is running for governor, refused to file suit. Perdue made an end run around him in May by getting a private firm to handle the work at no cost to the state. When asked for clarification, Oxendine's campaign said that making individuals make a purchase is well beyond the powers of the federal government. We covered the constitutionality of health care reform in an earlier PolitiFact Georgia item July 1. It noted the issue has yet to be decided in court, and plaintiffs aren't assured a win. The suit remains in its early stages, which means that Oxendine's statement that the bill is ""clearly beyond the delegated powers of the U.S. Constitution"" is not correct. Not yet, at least. And maybe not ever. Now we turn to the matter of whether the health care bill says families have ""to buy a product from a private company."" We find the rule is a bit more complicated than Oxendine's statement makes it out to be.Citizens are required to have health care coverage by 2014 under the bill. But not all will have to buy it from a private company or buy it at all, said tax expert Howard Gleckman, a resident fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, and Joseph Antos, a health policy expert with the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, a nonpartisan think tank with conservative roots. There are multiple exceptions to the rule. For instance, people under financial hardship, who have religious objections to purchasing health care or are American Indians do not have to buy it. People on Medicaid, which covers low-income people, don't have to buy insurance from a private company. The government covers them. The punishment for failing to buy health insurance is pretty mild. You don't get tossed into jail. Instead, you pay a tax penalty. The penalty is small in comparison to the cost of buying insurance, Antos and Gleckman agree. In 2014, it's $95 for most individuals. Later on it grows to $695. Higher-income people will pay based on different criteria. So Oxendine's statement about the families buying health insurance had some truth to it: The federal government did tell families to have health insurance. Many will purchase it from private companies. Some people, however, don't have to buy it or will get it from the government. People who are required to buy it, but hate the thought of doing so, can pay a tax penalty that will likely cost them less than insurance. But the constitutionality of the law is far from settled, and Oxendine's statement that Congress ""clearly"" overstepped its authority is premature.

Gov. Scott Walker says the current economic recovery is worst in U.S. history
","On Page 1 of his new book, Gov. Scott Walker makes the case that Wisconsin residents are facing some tough times. The first-term Republican governor declares the ""view from Washington D.C. these days is pretty grim"" and cites the re-election of President Barack Obama, the Affordable Care Act, tax increases, the national debt and the economy as a whole: ""We are experiencing the worst economic recovery America has ever had,"" Walker writes. That’s a strong statement. After all, the claim encompases more than 10 recessions and recoveries, including the post-Sept. 11 decline, the 1980 double dip recession, and, of course, the Great Depression. So is the state of affairs today really the worst of times? The publicist for Walker’s book didn’t respond to emails seeking comment. So, we’ll start with what Walker listed as his evidence. The footnotes cite an Aug. 3, 2012 entry on the Washington Post’s ""The Fix"" politics blog. The blog item discusses political ads by Republicans that use a snippet from a July 17, 2012 CBS newscast in which anchor Scott Pelley says: ""This is the worst economic recovery America has ever seen."" The short snippet contains no statistical backup to Pelley’s assertion, which was part of the  introduction to a report about unemployment. What’s more, the blog entry doesn’t exactly give the claim a ringing endorsement. It notes that other claims have been made regarding the recovery -- it’s the slowest in memory, second slowest since World War II, and that the jobs recovery is the slowest since the Depression. Then it notes: ""Most media outlets aren’t describing the recovery as the slowest ever. In other words, there’s not yet a consensus on this. So what Pelley was saying is news to plenty of people."" So the footnote Walker cited actually undermines his claim instead of supporting it. Another look So, how does the recovery from the Great Recession stack up? The recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, which is the official arbiter of such things. It is agreed that it was the nation’s worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. As for the recovery, Walker didn’t describe how he was measuring a recovery, but experts say there are numerous tools you can use to do so.   Two of the most frequently used are employment and economic output. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis website even has a tool that allows comparisons of the 10 recessions and recoveries since 1948 using those indicators. (The tool doesn’t extend back to the Depression because official government data gathering by the Bureau of Labor Statistics didn’t take place that far back.) ""This page provides a current assessment of 'how bad' the 2007-2009 recession was relative to past recessions, and of how quickly the economy is recovering relative to past recoveries,"" the Fed explains on its site. Here’s what the Fed’s site says: Employment: This recovery is not the worst when it comes to jobs. The employment recovery after the 1980 recession was particularly difficult. Then, the recovery sputtered and the economy slid into that ""double dip"" recession. Employment took 36 months to move to positive territory. During the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment didn’t crawl out of negative territory for about 28 months. By comparison, in the recovery from the 2007 recession, employment returned to positive territory after 20 months. Economic output: This recovery is the slowest since the Depression when it comes to economic output. After 17 months, the gross domestic product had increased 9.98 percent in the recent recovery. The recovery in output after the 1980 recession took place at a quicker pace, but after a far slower start. That recovery saw little growth in output between months five and 10, compared with slow but steady increases in the months following the start of the 2007 recovery. Put another way: the recovery from the 2007 recession took longer, but the country’s output was better than the 1980 recovery for a significant stretch. So, using the Fed’s calculator, Walker is wrong on employment and right on economic output -- but this does not account for the Great Depression. How does the Depression compare? Comparing the current recovery with recovery from the Depression is a little more difficult, said Sam Schulhofer-Wohl, senior vice president and director of research for the Minneapolis Fed. In the four years following the end of the Depression in 1933, gross domestic product shot up 43 percent, he said. That compares with 7 percent from 2009 and 2012, the most recent year  for which data is available. But that’s not a clean comparison, in part because Depression was so severe. ""In the Depression, GDP dropped so much that it couldn’t help but go up a lot"" during the recovery, said Schulhofer-Wohl, noting that he was speaking for himself and not the bank. Wells Fargo economist Brian Jacobsen offered a similar perspective. ""The first year out of the Great Depression had a GDP growth rate of 11 percent while the growth from 2009 to 2010 was a mere 2.7 percent,"" he said. Jacobsen said the economic decline in the Depression was much more severe than in the most recent recession. ""From 2007 to 2009, GDP dropped 3 percent while from 1929 to 1933, GDP dropped 27 percent,"" he said. ""If you had to pick this anemic recovery or the recovery from the Great Depression, and you had to take their respective downturns, I'd take this recovery any day."" Employment-wise the Depression was worse than any other downturn. Unemployment peaked at 24.9 percent in 1933, according to one measure. Six years later, it was still at 17.2 percent, a far slower jobs recovery than what we’re now seeing. And, there were economic upheavals that took place before the Depression. ""There were also terrible economic recoveries in the 1800s,"" Jacobsen said. ""In terms of recoveries, from 2009 to 2012, real per capita GDP grew about 6.1 percent.  The recovery in 1834, 1840, 1865, and 1893 were all much worse,"" Jacobsen said citing data from the Maddison Project, a global database of historical growth. Walker is not the first politician to take aim at the slow recovery. PolitiFact has looked at versions of the too-slow recovery claim, although no statement has been as broad as Walker’s. In June 2011, PolitiFact reviewed a statement by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney who said ""This is the slowest job recovery since Hoover."" That statement was rated False, because at that point of the recovery -- 23 months out -- there were two recoveries weaker in terms of employment than the current one, and three recoveries that saw an increase in the unemployment rate at that stage. The New York Times studied the length of the recovery in an economic blog in August 2012.   The Times took 10 metrics and compared the current recovery to all others since the Great Depression. In one category -- corporate profits -- the current recovery was better than the average of all of the other recoveries. In short, it’s not the worst. ""On almost every measure I looked at, there was at least one previous (completed) recovery that performed worse,"" Catherine Rampell wrote in the Times. Our rating In the opening passage of his new book, Walker cites the slow pace of the economic recovery as one of the woes facing Wisconsin. He says it’s the worst economic recovery the U.S. has ever had. But the jobs recovery was slower in other recessions, including the Great Depression. Economic output is a little less cut and dried because the Depression was so severe that the bounce back was more pronounced.

Estimates vary on cost of defensive medicine
","Some Georgians are finding more than the usual junk mail and bills in their mailboxes -- and we’re not talking about Christmas cards. There are glossy fliers discussing an effort to drastically change how patients can get compensated from medical malpractice, columnist Charlie Harper noted on his blog, Peach Pundit. Proponents want state lawmakers to pass a tort reform bill that would create an 11-member board to review alleged malpractice cases and award settlements. Too many doctors are charging for unnecessary medical tests, procedures or consultations in order to defend themselves in case they face lawsuits, say supporters of tort reform. Defensive medicine, it’s called. And what’s the impact to Georgians? ""We know that an overwhelming number of Georgia physicians practice defensive medicine,"" Wayne Oliver, executive director of Patients for Fair Compensation, said on the organization’s website. ""In Georgia alone, the practice of defensive medicine costs up to $14 billion annually."" Oliver, a longtime Georgia lobbyist, helped start Doctors for a Healthy Georgia, which cites the same figure. He said approximately 900 physicians have expressed support for the tort reform legislation. PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d do some lab work to see if the estimate is correct. Oliver said his interest in the subject began when he worked with the Center for Health Transformation, a group created by former Georgia congressman and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. In his work with the center, Oliver said he noticed that some doctors were providing care aimed at avoiding litigation. He supports two tort reform bills that weren’t passed last year by the Georgia Legislature. Some believe there should be a cap on malpractice. President Barack Obama has said defensive medicine ""may be contributing to unnecessary costs"" but has been reluctant to support a cap on malpractice cases. Oliver has made his case for such legislation in Forbes, The Washington Times and other publications. Oliver’s team forwarded us a 2012 report that examined the economics of defensive medicine in Georgia. The report, by a German-based team of researchers done for Patients for Fair Compensation, looked at two studies on the economic impact of defensive medicine in this state. The annual figures ranged from $14 billion to $22 billion. A 2010 Gallup-Jackson Healthcare report is referenced by many tort reform advocates. The report surveyed 462 randomly selected physicians who attribute 26 percent of overall health care costs to the practice of defensive medicine. Another Jackson Healthcare online survey of about 3,000 physicians attributed 34 percent of total health care costs to defensive medicine. Jackson Healthcare leaders multiplied federal estimates of health care costs ($2.6 trillion) times the 26 percent estimate from the physicians surveyed to conclude that defensive medicine could cost this country at least $650 billion a year. Georgia represents about 3 percent of the nation’s population. If the Jackson Healthcare estimate is correct, Georgia’s share of annual defensive medicine costs is approximately $19.5 billion, which is halfway between the estimates in the report cited by Oliver. Emory University economics professor David Frisvold reviewed the study earlier this year at the request of Patients for Fair Compensation. Frisvold cautioned that surveys of physicians to determine defensive medicine costs ""are likely towards the upper bound of the extent of defensive medicine as physicians may conflate physician-induced demand practices and defensive medicine practices."" Still, the professor concluded Georgia could save several billion dollars in defensive medicine as well as Medicaid costs over a 10-year period through medical tort reform. The $650 billion nationwide estimate has been used by U.S. Rep. Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon from north Fulton County, and Georgia Aquarium benefactor Bernie Marcus. Other reports, though, offer an assortment of conclusions about the financial impact of defensive medicine. Some support Oliver’s argument. Some do not. University of Michigan professor emeritus J. William Thomas co-authored a report published in September 2010 that found the costs of defensive medicine are ""minuscule"" nationally. Thomas and his team researched a database of more than 400 million paid medical and pharmaceutical claims amassed from CIGNA Healthcare from July 2004 to June 2006. The report concluded that even with significant reductions in medical malpractice premiums, defensive medicine costs would decline by just 0.4 percent nationally. Thomas said defensive medicine cost estimates vary because most research on the topic focuses on a few conditions. ""The politicians,"" he told us, ""will pick and choose from the evidence they want to cite."" Thomas referred us to another September 2010 report by Harvard University professor Michelle Mello and four other researchers. The report noted that defensive medicine costs are ""notoriously difficult to obtain"" because the definition varies. What some doctors see as a preventative medical procedure another believes is unnecessary. The team used a conservative estimate of 5.4 percent for the impact of defensive medicine, based upon a key prior study on the topic, and multiplied that by estimated annual totals for hospital spending of nearly $720 billion, which came up to $38.8 billion. The team then added some other costs it attributed to the impact of defensive medicine. Mello and her team estimated the national annual cost of defensive medicine was $45.5 billion, but cautioned in their report that the quality of evidence supporting that cost estimate is low because the hospital spending estimates are derived from a narrow range of diagnoses. The $45.5 billion national estimate is a fraction of the $650 billion estimate cited in the report by Oliver. ""The estimates are all over the board,"" Oliver agreed. ""What we do know is it’s a big number."" To sum up, Doctors for a Healthy Georgia said defensive medicine costs Georgia up to $14 billion a year. The estimate is on target if you rely on some reports. Other reports would suggest the impact to Georgia is far less. Everyone agrees the economic impact estimates are wide-ranging. To score a True on this one, you would have to acknowledge that there are wide-ranging estimates of the costs of defensive medicine. This statement is at least partially accurate, but you would need a lot of context to fully understand its full implications.

David Madland: CBO said failing to extend unemployment benefits 'will kill jobs'
","As the days tick down on this session of Congress, one of lawmakers’ final acts will be to extend or end unemployment benefits for about 1.3 million people. Without an extension through 2014, checks for the long-term unemployed would stop at the end of the month. The matter is intertwined with the budget deal that Republicans and Democrats are negotiating behind closed doors. The extension’s price tag is $26 billion. Democrats support it, but Republicans do not want to see the expense added to the national debt. Conservatives also argue that providing the additional money will simply encourage some people to turn down jobs they would otherwise accept. The longer they stay out of work, conservatives say, the less desirable they become in the eyes of a potential employer and the lower their earnings. Ultimately, the economy suffers. David Madland with the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning group that favors progressive government policies, rebutted that assertion with an opposite economic argument. ""The CBO (Congressional Budget Office) just said if we cut this extension, we will kill jobs, because those people who are looking for work won't have any money to spend,"" Madland said on CNN’s Crossfire. Madland told PunditFact he was referring to a report the Congressional Budget Office issued Dec. 3. We looked at that report. The budget office, the ultimate nonpartisan authority on money matters facing Congress, determined extending those additional unemployment checks would boost the economy by two-tenths of a percent next year and add about 200,000 jobs. That makes Madland's broader point -- that extending unemployment benefits actually boosts job creation -- correct. But he erred is suggesting the CBO determined that failing to extend unemployment benefits would ""kill"" jobs. The CBO did not analyze that. The report also came with a cautionary note. It said that if the government borrows more to pay for the extension then the move would ""eventually reduce the nation’s output and income slightly below what would occur under current law."" Steven Elliott, an economist at Miami University in Ohio, said the Congressional Budget Office is applying basic economic theory. ""The extended unemployment benefits will increase consumption because unemployed individuals who would otherwise not have income will be buying things,"" Elliott said. ""That in turn will mean that more products will need to be produced and then there are multiplier effects from there."" On the other end however, the meter runs in reverse. If Washington borrows the money, Congress will need to raise taxes to pay it back. That takes money away from households, and as a result, they buy less and the economy loses steam. Madland said that could happen but ""it is pretty hard to predict what fiscal policy or debt levels will be like in the long run."" Elliott agreed that the losses down the line might be avoidable. The hope, he said, is that a temporary hike in household spending becomes permanent. This leads to more jobs and more people paying taxes to pay back the borrowed funds. But there’s no guarantee that will happen. ""That’s the risk."" Elliott said. Our ruling Madland said the Congressional Budget Office found that a failure to extend unemployment benefits would kill jobs. Madland's language is close, but goes a step too far. The CBO said that extending unemployment benefits would spur growth and add about 200,000 jobs. The CBO did not conclude that failing to do so would result in the loss of jobs.

Broun video doesn't tell the whole story
","U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, a Republican from Savannah, was recently on the Fox News Channel to talk about his approach to make ""Obamacare"" work better for Americans. Fellow Georgia congressman Paul Broun, apparently, wasn’t impressed. ""Jack Kingston wants to keep Obamacare,"" Broun said in a YouTube video. ""He voted to fund it and now he wants to fix it."" Broun, an Athens Republican, ended the two-minute video by explaining his approach to improving health care -- and it starts with repealing the controversial health care law. The two Republicans are in a crowded field of candidates vying to win the GOP’s U.S. Senate nomination in 2014 for the Georgia seat being left open by Sen. Saxby Chambliss’ retirement. Kingston disputed Broun’s claim, which prompted Broun’s campaign to dispatch a press release titled: ""Broun to Kingston: How Is This a Lie?"" PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d get in the middle of this dispute. Broun spokeswoman Christine Hardman offered two examples of what he said were Kingston’s votes for the law. The first was Kingston’s vote in September 2012 for an appropriations bill. The second was Kingston’s support for a budget written earlier this year by former GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, a House member from Wisconsin. The 2012 legislation, House Joint Resolution 117, was a bill that helped fund the federal government for six months, through March 2013. The legislation provided $1 trillion for federal agencies, services and disaster recovery. The federal agencies include the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, which oversees the health care law. ""The bill makes minimal changes to fiscal year 2012 spending levels, except in cases that would cause catastrophic, irreversible, or detrimental changes to government programs, and to ensure good government and program oversight,"" the Republican-led House Appropriations Committee said in a statement at the time. The resolution passed by a 329-91 margin, with nine House members who didn’t vote. Broun was one of the 91 no votes, along with Rep. Phil Gingrey, a House Republican who is also running for the U.S. Senate. Kingston voted in favor of the bill, as did all 10 of his remaining colleagues from Georgia. Now, to the other half of Broun’s case against Kingston. On March 12, Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, presented his latest plan to balance the federal budget in 10 years. Much of it calls for spending cuts and projected revenue increases through tax cuts to businesses that Ryan believes will help the economy grow. Six days later, Broun wrote an op-ed that appeared in The New York Times decrying Ryan’s plan, saying the cuts don’t go far enough. ""We must repeal Obamacare — including the associated taxes, which the Ryan budget leaves intact by assuming the enactment of tax reform later on. We’ll replace it with a market-based health care system devoid of government involvement and managed by patients and their doctors, a plan I have described in my Patient Option Act,"" Broun, who practiced general medicine, wrote. Congress, as you know, has not been able to agree on a long-term budget plan. A resolution sponsored by Ryan to fund the government on a short-term basis passed the House on March 21. Kingston voted in favor of the resolution, but Broun cast his vote against it. Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford said the rationale behind Broun’s claim is illogical. ""The whole premise that Mr. Kingston supports Obamacare or has wavered in his dedication to its repeal is absurd,"" Crawford told us via email. ""He has voted more than 40 times to repeal and replace. That effort has seen seven parts of the law dismantled or defunded."" Kingston’s congressional website is full of news releases critical of the law or highlighting his votes against it. He voted against the bill when it passed the House by a slim majority in March 2010. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said Broun was ""nibbling around the edges"" with his claim because Kingston voted against the original legislation. She noted the September 2012 appropriations bill helped fund spending to operate the federal government, and it was not an entitlement bill. ""That accusation doesn’t reflect anything close to someone supporting Obamacare,"" said MacGuineas. So where does this leave us? Again, Broun said Kingston has voted to fund the health care law. Kingston has voted for federal legislation to keep the government running. Broun is using that to base his argument since the legislation includes spending for the health care law. However, it was a piece of a much larger spending package that includes defense spending and disaster recovery. Using that logic, Kingston could argue that Broun voted against defense spending. Broun’s claim contains an element of accuracy, but it gives people a misleading perception of Kingston’s position on Obamacare.

Univision's Ramos: The names Jose, Camilo and Maria are more popular than John and Steven
","Sandwiched between jokes on the Dec. 5, 2013, episode of the Daily Show, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos offered a factual claim that even had Daily Show host Jon Stewart asking, ""Really?"" Ramos was documenting the growth of the Hispanic population in the United States. Hispanics are the country’s largest ethnic minority group at 53 million people, and by 2060, the Hispanic population is expected to reach nearly 130 million. That would equal about a third of all Americans. Already, there are signs of a shift, Ramos said. ""The most popular name is no longer John or Steven,"" Ramos told Stewart. ""It's Jose, Camilo and Maria."" Like Stewart, we wondered if Ramos’ claim was correct. We got in touch with Ramos, and he clarified that when he talked about names, he had states like California and Texas in mind, not so much the entire United States. And he thought he was talking about which names were more popular (as a comparison), not the most popular overall. The ultimate source on baby names is the Social Security Administration, which conveniently provides a database that allows you to slice and dice the information by year, state and name. We found that in certain states, Ramos is partly right. In the five states with the highest portion of Hispanic residents, Jose is more popular than both John and Steven. We looked at other states that have some of the largest numbers of Hispanics and found that there is a break point. When the Hispanic population is above 27 percent of the total, Jose outranks John. Below that line, John is more popular.   State % Hispanic population Jose - rank among baby names John - rank among baby names New Mexico 46.7 28 56 California 38.1 25 55 Texas 38.1 6 36 Arizona 30.1 28 53 Nevada 27.1 41 57 Florida 22.8 73 39 Colorado 20.9 89 38 New Jersey 18.1 91 20 New York 18 100 26 Illinois 16.1 76 26 United States 17 72 28 Source: Social Security Administration So Ramos has a point when it comes to Jose and even more so for Steven, which fails to make the top 100 in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico. Ramos’ batting average falls for the rest of the names he gave. Camilo barely ranks in the top 1,000 nationwide. Maria is more popular but never does better than its rank of 58 in Texas. We should give a nod to the creativity or maybe just the flexibility of American parents. Since 2000, the popularity has fallen for every name Ramos mentioned, except Camilo. Nationally, Jose fell from 34 to 72, John went from 14 to 28, Steven dropped from 54 to 112, and Maria from 41 to 101. Camilo only shows up in the top 1,000 starting in 2009 and its rank moved from 901 to 837. If you were wondering, the most popular names in 2012: Jacob and Sophia. Our ruling Ramos said that the most popular names are no longer John or Steven, but Jose, Camilo and Maria. Afterward, Ramos said he was thinking of states with large Hispanic populations. With that caveat, he has a bit of a point. In states with the highest percentage of Hispanics, Jose beats out John and Steven. Camilo and Maria are not really contenders.

Heritage Foundation tweet says repealing Obamacare would be easier than repealing Prohibition
","If the whirlwind of news about the bumpy rollout of President Barack Obama’s signature health care law is making you dizzy, maybe it’s time to go for a drink. Maybe at a speakeasy? We had this idea after seeing a tweet sent recently by the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think-tank. Heritage, which opposes the Affordable Care Act, sent a tweet that featured a black-and-white photograph of people celebrating the 21st Amendment, which made it legal to buy, sell, transport and drink alcohol. The caption was: ""FACT: Repealing Obamacare would be easier than repealing Prohibition."" The tweet seems logical at first glance — after all, Prohibition was a constitutional amendment, while Obama’s health care law is ""only"" a law. But would it really be easier? Experts say the issue is actually more complicated than it looks. Repealing Prohibition First, let’s go back to 1917, when Congress passed the Volstead Act, a nationwide ban on the sale, production, importation and transportation of alcohol beverages. In 1919, the Volstead Act became the 18th Amendment to the Constitution. During the ""dry"" period, lasting from 1920 to 1933, organized crime increased significantly. With public support flagging, the 18th Amendment was scuttled after only 13 years, through ratification of the 21st Amendment, on Dec. 5, 1933. The repeal -- as do all repeals of constitutional amendments -- required a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate, as well as approval by three quarters of the states. Repealing a constitutional amendment is always ""a very difficult path,"" said Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist. ""That said, it was a fairly simple piece of policy to reverse, all things considered. Many states immediately changed their policies and legal drinking began right away,"" Loomis said. All told, it only took eight months to reach enough states -- 36 -- to completely overturn Prohibition. Repealing Obamacare What about repealing Obamacare? In theory, enacting or repealing a law, such as Obamacare, requires a simple majority in both the Senate and the House, followed by a presidential signature. That could happen pretty quickly if all parties were to agree. If both chambers of Congress agreed but president vetoed the bill, then a two-thirds vote is required in both houses. On the surface, then, ""repeal of Obamacare appears to be easier than repeal of the 18th Amendment,"" concluded Steven Smith, a congressional scholar at the Washington University in St. Louis. It doesn’t involve the states at all, and it can be passed by a simple majority if the president agrees. (No constitutional amendment has been ratified since 1992, and the previous one before that was in 1971, suggesting how hard a climb it is.) But repealing a law like Obamacare is hardly a piece of cake. For starters, scholars we interviewed all stressed how complex Obamacare is. The Affordable Care Act has 2,074 pages, a fact Republicans regularly complain about. (Take a look here at our fact-check of the actual length of the bill.) By contrast, the 18th Amendment that enacted Prohibition consists of only three paragraphs. The same goes for the 21st, which repealed it. ""The fact that the tweet (from the Heritage Foundation) is missing, is that there are 10 titles to the ACA,"" said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor. ""It’s not only health care, it’s also Medicare, Medicaid, fraud and abuse laws, preventive care laws, etc."" In addition, many provisions of Obamacare have already been enacted over the past few years, such as new regulations for medical education and training, preventive care, the right of parents to add children up to 26 years old on their policies, and an end to insurer rejections for pre-existing conditions for children and lifetime caps on medical expenses. ""If all of those were repealed, no one knows what would happen to the insured,""  Jost said. There would also be a risk that any fraud or abuse cases currently prosecuted under the health care laws would also have to be dismissed. In addition, Medicare and Medicaid were modified and expanded as part of Obamacare, and the so-called doughnut hole for Medicare prescription drug coverage was closed. ""If you repeal Obamacare and do nothing else, that would probably lead to a stop of all Medicaid payments,"" Jost said. Length of a possible repeal So let’s say Congress and the president really wanted to go through with a repeal of the health care law. How long would that take? ""Responsible legislation repealing Obamacare would be quite long, many hundreds or thousands of times longer than the three sentences of the 21st amendment"" needed to repeal Prohibition, political scientist Steven Smith said. Then there’s a whole separate problem: Many states have changed their laws according to the federal health care law, so each of those states would have to be repealed and rewritten as well. If you include all of these factors, Smith concluded, ""the repeal of Obamacare legislation would be much more difficult to write than the 21st Amendment."" When we ran these critiques by the Heritage Foundation, Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the think tank, said he disagreed. ""The claim that ‘responsible legislation repealing Obamacare would be quite long’ is ridiculous,"" Spakovsky said. He argued that it would only take a one-paragraph bill to repeal the health care law in its entirety.   ""The word ‘responsible’ is the key word that other so-called experts use to dispute this,"" Spakovsky said. ""They clearly believe that parts of Obamacare should be preserved."" Our ruling The Heritage Foundation tweeted that it would be easier to repeal Obamacare than it was to repeal Prohibition. It’s correct that, on paper, it’s procedurally easier to repeal a law than to repeal a constitutional amendment. However, Obamacare is a much more complicated piece of legislation than Prohibition was, meaning it would likely be far more complicated to eliminate all vestiges of the law.

State workers were paying about 6 percent of their premiums, so doubling would put that at 12 percent; meanwhile, the national average -- for public and private employees -- was 29 percent. Nearly three years later, the Republican governor, on a higher platform as an author and potential presidential candidate, made a similar assertion. In a Nov. 27, 2013 interview on Wisconsin Public Radio about his new book, Walker reflected on Act 10, the law that made most state -- as well as local -- government employees pay more for benefits. It also erased most of their collective bargaining powers. ""In the end, do public employees -- including me and my family -- pay a little bit more for pensions and health care? Absolutely,"" Walker told host Joy Cardin. ""But still far less than what our counterparts pay outside of government. Most people in this state pay 20 to 25 percent, for example, of their health insurance. Most of our public employees are still paying about 12 to 13 percent."" Let’s hit the ledgers again. Act 10 and state workers When we contacted Walker spokesman Tom Evenson about Walker’s new claim, he insisted that when the governor said public employes, he was referring only to state employees; Evenson also said ""state employees"" and ""public employees"" are synonymous. But that certainly would not have been clear to listeners. In the radio interview, Walker referred twice in quick succession to public employees, which would include not only state workers -- who number about 70,000 -- but some 200,000 local government and school employees, as well. Indeed, Act 10, the focus of Walker’s remarks, applies to that much larger group of public employees (except for police and firefighters, who were exempted from the law). Walker signed the innocuously labeled budget-repair bill, known formally as Act 10, in March 2011, after unprecedented protests in and around the state Capitol. The law did double, from 6 percent to 12 percent, what the vast majority of state employees pay toward health insurance premiums. That also applies to nearly 13,000 local government workers who get health insurance through the state. But Act 10 does not determine how much the vast majority of local public employees pay toward their premiums. Other public workers Local schools employ 99,000 full-time-equivalent employees statewide. Before Act 10, school workers who got health insurance through school districts paid an average of 4 percent to 5 percent of their premiums, according to school districts responding to a 2010-’11 survey by the Wisconsin Association of School Boards. Now, the average is 10 percent. The association’s data is by district and isn’t broken down to indicate what percentage most school employees pay. But the average figure show goes to Walker’s point that school employees are paying significantly less than private-sector workers. There are no such surveys for employees of cities, villages, towns and counties. Dan Thompson, executive director of the League of Wisconsin Municipalities, said Walker’s claim of 12 percent to 13 percent might be a little high, but is a reasonable estimate as an average of what city and village employees around the state pay toward their premiums. So, that figure also helps Walker make his case. The municipalities group had no hard number. Nor did the Wisconsin Counties Association or the Wisconsin Towns Association. So, Walker’s figure of 12 percent to 13 percent is accurate for state employees and a significant number of other public employees are paying that rate or less. Private sector As for the second part of Walker’s claim, Walker’s spokesman pointed us to 2012 figures from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for Wisconsin residents working in the private sector. They show employees paid 22 percent of the cost of the health insurance premiums for single coverage and 24 percent for family coverage. We posed Walker’s claim to Dave Jensen, editorial director of HCTrends, a Milwaukee health care research organization. He cited the same federal figures, known as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Jensen pointed out that the federal figures include public- as well as private-sector employees. But he said the proportion of public employees is so small that the federal figures still provide a solid estimate of how much private-sector employees are paying for health insurance. Our rating Walker said that even after his collective bargaining reforms, most Wisconsin public employees ""are still paying about 12 to 13 percent"" of their health insurance premiums, while most state residents who work in the private sector ""pay 20 to 25 percent."" The available figures indicate many if not most public employees are paying at or less than 12 percent and Walker was right on the private-sector workers part of his claim. We rate his statement Mostly True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.

James Carville: 1/3 of bank tellers are on public assistance
","One of the economic challenges facing the country is a growing inequality of income. Wealthier people are getting richer while the great majority of Americans are either making no gains or actually losing ground. The political parties differ on how they frame this problem. Republicans tend to say the solution is to create more jobs. Democrats agree but add that the quality of a job, primarily the pay, matters just as much.   Democratic strategist James Carville waded into this debate during ABC’s This Week. Carville picked an industry where the gap between the upper and lower ends is particularly strong. ""Can I just make one jaw-dropping point? This week it came out, a UC Berkeley study … said one-third of all bank tellers are on public assistance,"" Carville said. ""Why don't we pass a law to say if you were bailed out or you get free money from the fed or your deposits are insured or you're too big to fail, if the government backs you to that extent and you're that profitable an industry, you have to pay people a living wage?"" We’ll set aside the question of bailouts and livable wages. Our focus is on the claim that a third of bank tellers are on public assistance. As Carville said, that statistic comes from a study by the University of California - Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education. A New York City group, the Committee for Better Banks, commissioned the analysis. The committee says it represents the interests of frontline and back office bank workers. ""Salaries for bank tellers nationwide are so low that 31 percent of bank tellers and their family members are enrolled in some type of public assistance program,"" the committee cites in its report. That public assistance takes many forms. The grand total is nearly $900 million, with Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program accounting for over half. Food stamps, the Earned Income Tax Credit and welfare (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) make up the remainder. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the country had 560,000 tellers in 2010. The median wage was about $11.55 an hour, or $24,100 a year. About three-fourths of these people worked full time. In contrast, the median pay for a bank CEO was more than $550,000 last year and industry profits were over $140 billion. Carville pretty accurately quoted the report except in one respect that doesn’t make an enormous difference. He said one-third of bank tellers are on public assistance. The report actually spoke of bank tellers and their family members. That would include a worker’s child who gets health care through the Children’s Health Insurance Program. But since that child is eligible because the family makes less than a certain amount, we think it’s a minor point. The Berkeley Center recently did a similar analysis of fast food workers. When PunditFact looked into claims based on that report, we found that there was some disagreement among experts as to whether children’s insurance and the Earned Income Tax Credit should be counted as public assistance because these programs help families making as much as $50,000 a year. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 10 percent of bank tellers make more than about $32,000 a year. The government might have designed these programs to help somewhat more comfortable working families but that doesn’t change that the majority of bank tellers have very modest household incomes. The center used the same analytic method in both the fast food and bank teller studies. It is a model that involves a complex blending of different government data sets. In our last fact-check, experts generally agreed that the approach would produce reasonably accurate results. Our ruling Carville said that one-third of bank tellers are on public assistance. In large part, Carville was faithful to a labor market analysis conducted on behalf of a group that advocates for better pay for lower-level bank employees. Carville made a minor error in talking about the bank tellers themselves when the study included their children. And there is debate among experts as to whether children’s insurance and the Earned Income Tax Credit should be counted as public assistance. Because of those caveats, we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/dec/08/james-carville/james-carville-13-bank-tellers-are-public-assistan/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Poverty', 'Workers', 'Rob Portman']","
Rob Portman says 'about 2 percent of Americans get paid the minimum wage'
","Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman questioned Democrats who want to raise the federal minimum wage and offered a flurry of statistics to help make his point. Speaking Sunday on ABC's This Week, Portman suggested that raising the $7.25 an hour minimum wage could force employers to cut jobs. ""If you want to deal with income inequality, the No. 1 way to do it is to get people to work. That's what all the statistics show. About 2 percent of Americans get paid the minimum wage. Of that group, by the way, less than .3 of 1 percent of Americans are both under poverty -- under the line of poverty and on minimum wage. So it's a lot of young people. About 50 percent of them are between 16 and 24 years old. For a lot of them, it's a part-time job. So what you don't want to do is raise the minimum wage to the point that you're actually losing jobs."" That exchange includes a bunch of different statistics, but here we’ll be checking this one: ""About 2 percent of Americans get paid the minimum wage."" We won’t get into the question of what this means for minimum-wage policy here; for now, we’ll just look at the numbers. To do so, we turned to a study published by Bureau of Labor Statistics -- the federal government’s official chronicler of employment and wage data -- titled, ""Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers: 2012."" It was released on Feb. 26, 2013. The study found that a little under 3.6 million workers were paid either at or below the federal minimum wage. (The study did not look at whether workers were paid higher minimum wage rates set by their state, as many states have done.) To determine the percentage, we looked at the number of Americans employed. That number ranged between about 133 million and 134 million during 2012. If you divide the two numbers, it turns out that, by the official statistics, roughly 2.6 percent of all American workers were earning the minimum wage in 2012. That’s slightly higher than Portman indicated, but his estimate was definitely in the ballpark. That said, we do see a few caveats, none of which strike us as particularly troublesome for the accuracy of his comment. • Portman said ""2 percent of Americans,"" but to be entirely accurate, he really should have said 2 percent of workers. To figure out the percentage of ""Americans"" earning the minimum wage, we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimated that the U.S. population in 2012 was 313,914,040. That would mean that minimum-wage workers accounted for just over 1 percent of Americans. That said, dividing by the number of Americans would not be a very useful number -- it includes a lot of people who aren’t old enough to work or who have retired. • Portman referred to people who ""get paid the minimum wage."" Actually, the numbers he cited refer to Americans who either get paid the minimum wage or get paid less than the minimum wage. How can you get paid less than the minimum wage? The minimum-wage law actually exempts whole classes of workers from the $7.25 standard -- ""vocational education students,"" ""full-time students employed by retail or service establishments, agriculture, or institutions of higher education,"" and those ""impaired by a physical or mental disability."" This is not a trivial population -- for 2012 at least, the number earning less than the minimum wage (about 2 million) actually exceeded the number who earned the minimum wage exactly (about 1.6 million). In addition, it’s worth noting that workers in tipped professions, such as wait staff, get a legal minimum wage that’s well below $7.25. By factoring in tips earned, the employer only has to pay workers a minimum of $2.13 an hour. One other note: The BLS offers some words of caution about its data. It counted only minimum-wage workers who are actually paid by the hour. Salaried and other non-hourly workers are excluded from the BLS analysis. BLS says the number of salaried workers earning at or below the minimum wage is probably modest, but the data is sufficiently opaque that the agency warns that ""the actual number of workers with earnings at or below the prevailing federal minimum is undoubtedly understated."" BLS also warns that this study is based on a sample, and samples are imperfect. Our ruling Portman said that ""about 2 percent of Americans get paid the minimum wage."" He didn’t word the statement with complete accuracy; he would have been better off saying that, according to official statistics, ""about 2 percent of American workers get paid at or below the federal minimum wage."" Still, his number is close to accurate, and his general point -- that workers who are paid the federal minimum-wage represent a small percentage of the entire working population -- is backed up by official data. We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/dec/08/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-about-2-percent-americans-get-pai/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Education', 'Small Business', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'David Dewhurst']","
Dewhurst didn't personally cut taxes--and some increased
","David Dewhurst, seeking his fourth term as lieutenant governor of Texas, consistently talks up the state’s economy while simultaneously noting tax cuts. The Houston Republican, who presides over the Texas Senate, touted 54 tax cuts in a recent video ad. A bit earlier, in an Oct. 1, 2013, post on his campaign website, he took credit for even more. ""Under my leadership, the Texas Senate has helped strengthen our state’s foundation with essential conservative legislation,"" Dewhurst said. His post singled out actions to balance budgets, address border security and tort reform, stop Medicaid from expanding, restrict abortions--and to cut taxes. The Senate passed legislation to cut ""taxes for all Texans,"" Dewhurst’s web post continued. ""I have cut taxes 63 times, including a 2006 property tax reduction that ranks as the largest in state history."" Dozens of Dewhurst-provided cuts? We were curious. Big picture, Texans paid about the same level of taxes in 2010 (the latest year of available data) as they did when Dewhurst took over as lieutenant governor in 2003, according to calculations by the non-partisan Tax Foundation in Washington, D.C. Foundation figures indicate that on average, Texans ponied up 5.7 percent of their personal income for state and local taxes in Texas both of those years. Still, in between that percentage dropped to as little as 5.1 percent, in 2006 and 2008, the figures suggest. After we inquired into Dewhurst’s reference to cutting taxes 63 times, Dewhurst’s campaign blog post was amended to say 54 cuts. We stuck with checking what was posted for about two months. Earlier, to our request for backup information, Dewhurst campaign spokesman Travis Considine emailed a document headlined ""David Dewhurst Tax Cuts"" stating that since becoming lieutenant governor, Dewhurst ""has cut taxes by more than $15 billion through 63 pieces of legislation."" Among the listed measures, a 2006 measure setting in motion one-third reductions in school district maintenance and operation property tax rates is credited with ""savings"" of more than $12.6 billion, accounting for 84 percent of Dewhurst’s total declared savings. A convention of Texas state government is to estimate costs and savings in one- or two-year increments. That's probably because lawmakers almost always budget two years at a time. By email, Considine told us the campaign chose to list five-year savings figures when they were available from fiscal notes written by budget board staff at the time the cited measures passed into law. He didn’t say why. Not noted on Dewhurst's backup: The 2006 reduction was partly funded by tax increases. According to a chart emailed to us Dec. 3, 2013, by John Barton, a staff spokesman for the Legislative Budget Board, the various increases were initially projected to raise nearly $4.7 billion in the fiscal year that ran through August 2011. In that year, the chart indicates, the property-tax reductions were expected to cost the state about $7 billion--while in reality, the tax hikes generated about $2.5 billion less in 2011 than initially predicted. We took a long look at the campaign's list of tax-cut measures, finding the vast majority to be carefully targeted, that is, not necessarily benefiting every Texan. By our count, about 40 of the changes in law related to exempting particular entities or transactions from sales or property taxes, many of them not lacking a precise savings estimate. Dewhurst’s document lists about 10 sales tax-cut measures. The largest, at a value of about $700 million through five years, is a 2013 law exempting from the sales tax through 2026 ""depreciable tangible personal property directly used in qualified research,"" the legislation’s fiscal note states. Another 2013 law provided for sales tax refunds to providers of cable or Internet access was projected by the budget board at a value of $250 million over five years. Dewhurst’s document also specifies a 2009 law placing backpacks among items subject to the state’s annual three-day ""sales tax holiday,"" a change projected to save affected taxpayers more than $40 million over five years, according to the proposal’s fiscal note. Also noted: A 2007 law exempting pay-phone calls from the sales tax at a projected five-year value of more than $6 million, per the relevant state fiscal note. Among about 30 listed measures touching on property taxes, a 2013 law exempted equipment in certain data centers from property taxes at a projected five-year value of $58 million. A 2007 law protecting elderly and disabled homeowners with homestead exemptions from being stuck with potentially higher school taxes was projected by the state to save beneficiaries (and cost the state) $745 million over five years, while a 2009 law giving full homestead exemptions to fully disabled veterans was predicted to be worth more than $50 million over five years. Dewhurst’s document lists a half-dozen laws related to the business franchise tax, though there appears to be a little duplication in that an exemption of small businesses was simply extended. A 2013 law changing who pays the tax, extending a small business exemption and temporarily lowering the tax rate was projected to reduce such tax collections by $1.3 billion over five years. By far, though, the stand-out measure on Dewhurst’s list is House Bill 1, signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry in May 2006 and described by Dewhurst as cutting school property taxes by more than $12.6 billion over five years. We couldn’t confirm that figure, but the budget board chart shows more than $30 billion in state expenditures from 2007 through 2011 to cover the state costs of the tax cuts. Separately, it’s been disputed whether the 2006 actions whittled taxes as much as some ballyhooed. In 2010, we rated as Mostly False a Perry claim that ""we cut property taxes by one third."" The tax-rate mandate did reduce school property taxes at first. School tax collections declined 6.4 percent between 2005 and 2007, the year the cuts were fully implemented, according to the Texas Education Agency, which also offered us data showing that collections for school maintenance and operations taxes were 30.2 percent lower in 2007 than the state projected they would have been without the tax cut. A business group, the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, reached a similar conclusion by comparing 2007 school property taxes with what it calculated Texans would have paid without the mandated cut. The related savings were about $7 billion, it said. ""The average Texan's total property tax bill in 2007 was 20 percent lower than what it likely would have been had there been no tax relief initiative,"" the group concluded. Then again, school property tax collections ultimately increased partly because districts had leeway to inch up their rates over the years and benefited, in many cases, from increasing property values. In both 2006 and 2007, the total taxable value of property in Texas rose more than 10 percent each year. The taxpayer association identified other reasons that the overall reduction in property taxes did not meet expectations: increases in the portion of school taxes dedicated to bond debt, as well as increases in taxes paid to cities, counties and other taxing districts. As we noted above, Dewhurst’s declared tax cuts were accompanied by some tax hikes intended to make up a portion of the school revenue lost due to the rate reductions. As described in a TTARA guide to Texas school funding, revised in January 2012, legislators created a tax-relief fund to reimburse districts by drawing on revenue gains from a revised and expanded business franchise tax and increases in state cigarette and tobacco taxes, plus a change in how the state calculates the taxable price of used cars and trucks. According to the guide, some $2.2 billion was to be pulled from the fund in the 2011-12 school year. A May 19, 2006, Austin American-Statesman news article called the expansion of the state’s business tax the ""centerpiece"" of Perry’s plan to cut school property taxes. As he signed the business-tax measure into law, Perry said: """"Today I am proud to sign into law landmark business tax reforms that will provide greater fairness for employers, reliable funding for our school classrooms and revenue that will help deliver a record $15.7 billion property tax cut for the people of Texas."" The Statesman story continued: ""The plan cuts property tax rates for school operations by one-third over two years. It adds $1 per pack to the cigarette tax. The plan will cut more in taxes than it brings in, and it includes $1.5 billion in increased school spending, including $2,000 pay raises for teachers."" Considine stressed to us by email that there was still a net tax decrease thanks to the 2006 actions. The record-breaking part of Dewhurst's blog-post claim rings true. We recalled only one other substantial statewide property-tax break. The 1997 Legislature sent voters a proposed constitutional amendment, subsequently adopted, increasing from $5,000 to $15,000 the residential homestead exemption from school property taxes, a change then estimated to save a typical Texas homeowner about $12 a month, according to a July 1997 report by the House Research Organization. That report also said: ""The net result would be one of the largest tax reductions in state history."" By email, school finance expert Joe Wisnoski of Austin offered his ballpark estimate that the 1997 actions have a current-day annual value of about $$650 million to $700 million with the annual value of the 2006 tax-rate actions being far more--at least $6 billion, he said. Finally, we identified no reason to believe Dewhurst didn’t support all the tax-cut proposals passed into law on his watch. He’s a long-time Republican leader in the Republican-steered Capitol. But he didn’t personally cut any taxes. He had no vote on the listed measures--those belonged to senators and House members. On the other hand, his powers include the appointment of pivotal Senate committees, the reference of individual proposals to particular committees and the setting of the Senate's floor agenda. He was a gavel-wielding player. Our ruling Dewhurst said: ""I have cut taxes 63 times, including a 2006 property tax reduction that ranks as the largest in state history."" This statement paints an incomplete picture. About 63 (or 54) measures giving someone a tax break passed into law on Dewhurst’s watch, but it's not like Texans are less tapped by such taxes of late than before. Notably, too, most of the touted laws targeted particular beneficiaries. Also, Dewhurst didn't personally cut any taxes; those decisions involved the House, Senate and governor, though Dewhurst was a leader. The 2006 school property-tax-rate reduction was historic. But this statement fails to acknowledge that actions Dewhurst helped usher into place the same year led to hundreds of millions of dollars in lesser tax increases. All told, this claim contains an element of truth, but overlooks critical facts that would give a full, accurate impression. We rate it as Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Loretta Weinberg says George Washington Bridge toll is among the highest in the country
","Commuters who use the George Washington Bridge have followed with interest the recent political dustup about the closing of several access lanes in Fort Lee for a few days in September. Sen. Loretta Weinberg, among others, has questioned whether the closures were political retribution against Fort Lee’s Democratic mayor for failing to endorse Republican Gov. Chris Christie for re-election last month. In a Nov. 14 radio interview on the John Gambling program on WOR 710 AM, she let fly a statement on how much the bridge costs to use. ""We pay among the highest tolls in the nation for the privilege of crossing that bridge,"" Weinberg (D-Bergen), the Senate’s majority leader, told Gambling as they discussed the closure controversy, which has since led to the Assembly subpoenaing Port Authority executives to testify about the matter. Weinberg is correct, dollars-wise. Before we get to bridge toll costs, let’s note that bridges in the New York and New Jersey region are run by either the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, or the Metropolitan Transit Authority. It’s worth noting that for every bridge we mention, we’re using the peak toll cost for a standard two-axle vehicle. The most expensive bridge in the region is the MTA-run Verrazano-Narrows, which connects Brooklyn and Staten Island. A $15 toll is collected only on the side going from Brooklyn to Staten Island. The most expensive bridges after the Verrazano-Narrows are the George Washington, Goethals and Bayonne bridges, and the Outerbridge Crossing. The $13 toll for each bridge is collected on one side. The George Washington Bridge connects upper Manhattan with Fort Lee. Now let’s look at toll costs for some other major bridges in the nation. The 17-mile Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel, which connects the Virginia Beach and Norfolk areas with Virginia’s Eastern Shore, is $13 and also collected in one direction. That toll will rise to $15 on Jan. 1. California’s Golden Gate Bridge, which connects San Francisco to the state’s northern counties, is $6. And the Mackinac Bridge, connecting Michigan’s upper and lower peninsulas, is $4. So Weinberg is correct that the George Washington Bridge has among the highest tolls in the nation. But some experts told us there’s more to the toll cost for that bridge and others in this region than perhaps in other parts of the country. Dr. Robert Paaswell, distinguished professor of Civil Engineering for the City College of New York, agreed that the George Washington Bridge toll is likely among the higher-cost tolls, but said it’s critical to note why. Paaswell explained that the bridge is important to the regional economy because of the truck and freight traffic that brings goods and services to the area from other parts of the country. The toll cost also helps maintain the structure, he said. And Martin Robins, director emeritus of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University, said toll costs in the New York/New Jersey region pay for far more than the bridges operated by both the Port Authority and MTA. He said Weinberg’s claim is ""probably true."" ""The Port Authority not only supports (those toll bridges) but the PATH system and the Port Authority bus system,"" Robins said. ""It wraps them up all in one package and supports that system. The MTA is similar. They support the New York City subway and bus system."" Rod Diridon, executive director of the Mineta Transportation Institute in San Jose, Calif., also noted tolls in this region of the country are higher ""primarily because of the vitality of industry and the consequential cost of living."" ""In the heartland, our industries, our businesses have not been so robust as on the coasts,"" Diridon added. ""As a consequence, the cost of everyting is less in the central part of the nation. The cost of tolls is less and the cost of construction is less as well."" Our ruling Weinberg said recently about the George Washington Bridge, ""We pay among the highest tolls in the nation for the privilege of crossing that bridge."" The highest bridge toll in the region belongs to the MTA-operated Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, at $15, but the George Washington span and three others are close behind, at $13. Major toll bridges elsewhere in the country aren’t even close, save for the 17-mile Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel, whose $13 toll will jump to $15 on Jan. 1. Experts we spoke with cite varying factors for why the George Washington Bridge’s toll costs what it does, but the bottom line is that Weinberg’s assessment about where the cost ranks nationwide is accurate. We rate her claim True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.",/factchecks/2013/dec/08/loretta-weinberg/loretta-weinberg-says-george-washington-bridge-tol/

Just how wealthy is the Wal-Mart Walton family?
","On Nov. 27, 2013, a Madison-based liberal advocacy group used a mass email to promote protests that were planned against Walmart stores for two days later -- Black Friday. The demonstrations aimed to ""expose Wal-Mart’s shameful labor practices and support workers,"" according to One Wisconsin Now, which then made this claim: ""The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined."" That reminded us of a March 2011 claim by filmmaker and liberal activist Michael Moore. He said in a Madison speech that 400 Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined, a statement we rated True. Based on online hits, it became one of our most popular fact-checks ever. So we wondered about the Walmart claim. Wealth, not income In the days before and after Black Friday, leaders no less prominent than President Barack Obama and Pope Francis decried the extent of income disparity in the United States and around the world. Obama called the growing income gap a ""defining challenge of our time."" The pope said that while the earnings of a minority ""are growing exponentially, so, too, is the gap separating the majority from the prosperity enjoyed by those happy few."" Walmart, of course, is a big target. According to Forbes, as of May 2013 the international retailer had $469 billion in sales and 2.2 million employees, including 1.3 million in the United States. The corporation has been criticized for low wages; and in December 2012, PolitiFact National rated as Mostly True a claim that more Walmart employees are on Medicaid and food stamps than other companies. But let’s be clear up front: Although income and wealth are related, they’re not the same. Wealth is commonly measured in terms of net worth -- the value of a person’s assets minus liabilities. So, things like savings and retirement accounts, minus what is owed on a home mortgage, credit cards, etc. That means a person with heavy debt can have little wealth, or negative wealth, even while earning a six-figure income. One more point before we get to the wealth figures. Walmart was founded by the late Sam Walton, who opened the first store in Arkansas in 1962. Walmart incorporated in 1969 and became a publicly traded company a year later. So, Wal-Mart is not family owned, but rather owned by its stockholders; on the other hand, according to Bloomberg and other news reports, the Walton family members still have control of the company, owning about half of the shares. Group's evidence Scot Ross, One Wisconsin Now's executive director, told us his evidence to back his group’s claim is a July 2012 article by economist Josh Bivens, research and policy director of the liberal Economics Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. Bivens wrote that in 2010, the wealth of six Walton family heirs was $89.5 billion, 22 percent higher than in 2007. Meanwhile, the median wealth of American families in 2010 was $77,300, nearly 39 percent lower than three years earlier. (Median wealth refers to the American family that is exactly wealthier than half of all families and less wealthy than half.) As for measuring one against the other, Bivens said the Walton family wealth in 2010 was as large as the wealth of the bottom 48.8 million families in the United States, or 41.5 percent of all American families. Rounded up, 41.5 percent would be 42 percent, the figure One Wisconsin Now claims. But let's keep shopping around a little. Similar claim It turns out that a statement nearly identical to the one made by One Wisconsin Now was uttered in July 2012 by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats. Sanders said the Walton family owns ""more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America,"" a claim PolitiFact National rated True. Our colleagues found that Sylvia Allegretto, a labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley, compared the Waltons’ cumulative net worth with that of the overall population, as cited in the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances. That survey was published in August 2012. Allegretto found that the Waltons’ wealth in 2010 was valued at $89.5 billion -- equal to the entire bottom 41.5 percent of American families. The 2010 figures are the latest available for doing comparisons with the net worth of the overall population. But we found, using the Forbes 400 list for 2013, that the wealth of six of Sam Walton’s descendants has continued to grow. Here are their rankings and their wealth: No. 6 Christy Walton (daughter-in-law), $35.4 billion No. 7: Jim Walton (son), $33.8 billion No. 8: Alice Walton (daughter), $33.5 billion No. 9: S. Robson Walton (son), $33.3 billion No. 95: Ann Walton Kroenke (niece), $4.7 billion No. 110: Nancy Walton Laurie (niece), $4 billion Total Walton family wealth: $144.7 billion. A note before we close: Allegretto told us the housing crisis is a key reason that the gap between the Walton family wealth and the wealth of other American families has grown. More Americans were left with ""negative wealth"" because they lost their biggest asset -- their home -- and often significant amounts of their savings, as well, she said. Our rating One Wisconsin Now wrote: ""The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined."" For comparison purposes, the latest data available, for 2010, the figure is 41.5 percent. We rate the statement True.

U.S. Rep. James Langevin says it takes just 90 seconds to pass a federal firearms background check
","Imagine contacting the federal government and getting what you need in 90 seconds. U.S. Rep. James Langevin says that's how long it takes to get a federal background check if you're seeking to buy a firearm. The statement comes in a Dec. 3 news release, issued jointly with Rep. David Cicilline, calling for ""a more effective background check process"" that includes mental health records that Rhode Island, under law, is prevented from giving to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). (A General Assembly commission is exploring whether to modify the law.) Langevin reports, ""The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires an individual to pass a background check through the NICS database before purchasing a firearm from a federally licensed dealer, a process that typically takes 90 seconds."" Why is the 90 seconds important to the gun control issue? Langevin spokeswoman Meg Fraser said it shows that ""running a background check is generally a quick process, and adding additional records to the system would not result in a significant change or inconvenience to the customer."" There are days when we can't get a cup of coffee at Starbucks in 90 seconds, so we wondered if the background check process is really that quick. We turned to people who use the system regularly. Robert Carney, owner of Post Road Guns on Plainfield Pike, in Cranston, said it's true that it usually takes 90 seconds or less for the NICS to search its database and determine whether a customer is eligible to purchase a weapon. And he does it with a phone call, not with a computer. The same is true for Adam Dacko, of Foster Bear Arms & Trading Post, in Foster. He estimated that 75 percent to 90 percent of the checks are completed within 45 seconds. Delays may occur if someone has a common name and doesn’t provide a Social Security number, which is optional. ""It takes longer for me to read off the form than it does for me to get a response,"" he said.   Which brings up another point: That's not the whole process. Carney showed us Form 4473 from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which must be filled out first. It requires basic information such as height, weight and gender, along with questions about whether the would-be buyer is under indictment, has been convicted of a felony, has received a dishonorable discharge from the military, is addicted to any controlled substance, or is subject to a restraining order for harassing, stalking or threatening a child, ""intimate partner or the child of an intimate partner."" It took us just under three minutes to fill out the form's 27 questions and sign it. The seller must then confirm the buyer's identification, contact the NICS system, recite all the information on the form over the phone to an operator (or type it into the computer), and take down the confirmation information supplied through the NICS system. That would take a few more minutes. Gun dealer Robert Swinehart of Arquebus Co., in West Warwick, said the whole process typically takes about five minutes. Fraser then sent us a link to an FBI fact sheet about the NICS system, which claims that a ""response is typically provided within 30 seconds."" Swinehart said 30 seconds is typical for him when the buyer has a clean record. Although the local firearms dealers are required to keep the form on file, federal authorities are required to delete the personal details received during each NICS inquiry once the sale is approved. If a buyer wants to purchase another gun the next day, the would-be purchaser has to go through the process all over again. In addition to the federal check, local police are required to run a check as well, which can take a few days. It's all part of the state's seven-day waiting period. Our ruling James Langevin said in a news release that passing a federal firearms ""background check through the NICS database . . . typically takes 90 seconds."" Gun dealers tell us the federal process is, in fact, usually very quick, barring some ambiguity with a person's record. However, some readers might take Langevin's statement to mean that the whole process takes 90 seconds. It actually requires a few minutes for the customer to fill out the paperwork and the dealer to transmit the information to the NICS system. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

Texas near top in local debt per capita
","In a Nov. 13, 2013, campaign press release, Debra Medina pledged that as Texas state comptroller she would ""resist growth in government spending,"" saying, ""At present spending levels, only citizens of New York have a greater local debt burden than Texans."" An earlier version of the claim sent out via email said simply ""greater debt burden,"" not ""local""; the campaign posted an updated release online. We looked at state debt in a July 24, 2011, fact-check on Gov. Rick Perry, rating as Mostly True his claim that Texas had ""the fourth-lowest debt per capita of any state in the nation, and we are the lowest of any of the big states."" How does debt shake out at the local level? Medina, a tea-party favorite from Wharton, got 19 percent of the vote in the 2010 Republican gubernatorial primary against Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. The Medina campaign told us via email that her Texas-New York comparison was based on a Sept. 26, 2012, report, ""Your Money and Local Debt,"" issued by the current state comptroller, Susan Combs. In 2009, Texas had $7,983 in local debt per capita, the report said, placing Texas second among the 10 most populous states. New York was first with $8,744 in local debt per capita; California was third with $6,469 per capita. Texas comptroller report, ""Your Money and Local Debt,"" Sept. 26, 2012, based on 2009 data: The report relied on 2009 U.S. Census Bureau data, which Combs spokesman R.J. DeSilva told us via email was drawn from the December 2011 annual report of the Texas Bond Review Board. That agency oversees the issuance of state bonds used to fund activities as varied as making housing loans to veterans and helping local governments finance water projects. ""State and local debt"" are defined in the bureau’s July 2013 summary of 2011 data as ""all interest-bearing short-term credit obligations and all long-term obligations incurred in the name of the government and all its dependent agencies, whether used for public or private purposes."" U.S. states divide local and state responsibilities in different ways. Texas spends little at the state level; local costs may be borne by hospital districts, school districts and the like in addition to city and county governments. The Census and Board both presented local debt estimates alongside state debt. We next looked for comparisons using more recent data and all 50 states. The Bond Review Board offers its own annual estimate of local debt in Texas. In the most recent report that was available when Medina’s release was sent out, published in December 2012, the agency said Texas’ local debt per capita was $7,507 in the fiscal year that ran through August 2011. Board spokesman Robert Latsha told us by phone that, though he wasn’t certain exactly what the Census included in its figures, it’s likely the largest difference between the Census and board estimates comes from debt set up by quasi-governmental agencies such as local housing finance corporations or economic development corporations. Only debt from bonds and shorter-term securities issued by local governments is reported to the board, Latsha said. He said the board didn’t calculate comparisons with all 50 states. Census Bureau spokesman Joseph Dalaker told us by phone that the bureau didn’t either, but he helped us find data comparable to what the board probably used when comparing the 10 biggest states. Using those Census estimates of local debt and state population -- from the most recent data sets available when Medina spoke in November 2013 -- we found Texas was third among all 50 states and, again, second among the 10 most populous. Highest local debt per capita among all 50 states: Sources: U.S. Census Bureau population estimates, July 12, 2012, and local debt estimates, Dec. 6, 2012 In the board’s December 2013 report, which came out after Medina made her statement, the state board updated local debt per capita in fiscal 2012 to $7,514 by its own estimation and $8,431 according to Census data, keeping Texas in second place among the 10 most populous states. Medina’s claim referred to the debt burden falling on ""citizens."" But state residents might not be directly on the hook for the whole amount. Dalaker told us, ""You really have to tease out who’s paying."" For example, taxes on tourists can help pay for projects, he said. Moody’s Investors Service spokesman David Jacobson told us by phone, ""What’s more important is your ability to pay back that debt and how it is structured."" Many Texas entities have good credit, he said. Our ruling Medina said, ""At present spending levels, only citizens of New York have a greater local debt burden than Texans,"" but without mentioning that her comparison was based on the 10 most-populated states. Texas is second among the big states and third among all 50 in recent estimates. We rate her statement as True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

"['Oregon', 'Health Care', 'Cover Oregon']","

Can Cover Oregon health insurance plans be purchased ""for the cost of $5 vanilla soy latte a day?""
","The success of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act relies heavily on persuading younger people to sign up. While it’s not guaranteed that those in their early 20s are healthier than their older, graying counterparts, they tend to be. Without them, health insurance exchanges are likely to fill with people who need more care, increasing overall risks and sending insurance premiums higher. Still, it may not be an easy sell to get the 75 percent of younger people who lack health care insurance according to a recent Gallup poll, to sign up for coverage. Some may bet they simply don’t need health care coverage. Others may do the math and figure they’d spend less on the federally mandated penalty for not having coverage. So state and federal insurance officials are coming up with novel ways to get the message to their target audience. A group in Colorado, for instance, crafted an Internet-only ad campaign showing a college student doing a handstand on a keg of beer. ""Keg stands are crazy,"" the ad said. ""Not having health insurance is crazier."" Cover Oregon is now running ads with the same goal of attracting young people. In trying to show that health insurance is more affordable than many think, the tag line is, ""For the cost of [a] $5 vanilla soy latte a day, you can get a sweet health insurance plan to match."" That figure caught our eye. PolitiFact Oregon decided to check whether Cover Oregon has the grounds to say coverage can be obtained for the cost of a daily coffee drink. We called Michael Cox, a Cover Oregon media contact. He passed along charts showing the cost for monthly insurance premiums in the seven coverage areas around the state: Portland, Bend, Eugene, Salem, Medford, Pendleton-Hermiston and the coast. Each chart contains rates of the 14 companies expected to offer plans through Cover Oregon for people ages 21, 40 and 60. The rates assume that those applying for insurance are single, non-tobacco users. The chart includes prices for three levels of coverage: Bronze (pays an estimated 60 percent of medical costs), Silver (70 percent), and Gold (80 percent).  As noted later, catastrophic-only plans will also be available. All amounts represent costs before financial help in the form of tax credits. When asked about the $5-a-day claim, Cox directed us to a plan offered by Moda Health. It charges a 21-year-old unmarried non-tobacco-user $130 a month for bronze-level coverage. That comes out to $1,560 annually. Divide that by 365 days, and you get just over $4.27 per day. ""So really,"" Cox said, ""you’d get a little change back for that $5 bill."" (And, yes, the costs are roughly in line with a vanilla soy latte. At Portland-area Starbucks, the drink runs $3.85 to $4.85, depending on size.) A 40-year-old, by comparison, would pay $166 a month for the same Moda Health coverage, and a 60-year-old would see premiums of $352. But the claim holds up if applied only to the younger demographic Cover Oregon is targeting. Of the 12 companies that have published rates, four offer plans for that age group for less than $5 a day. Six more offer coverage ranging from $5.06 to $5.95. The others cost $6.08 and $6.96. It’s also important to note that, at this point, nine of the companies offer catastrophic-only plans that, for the most part, are well below the $130 per month premiums charged by Moda Health. So is the question that simple? We wanted a little more context, so we asked Cox how the campaign came about. It is, indeed, aimed at younger people, he said in a telephone interview. That’s why the ads, showing the image of a steaming cup of coffee with ""$5"" stamped on the front, appear only on Internet sites likely to be viewed by so-called Millennials. And bringing ""vanilla soy latte"" into the discussion? ""It’s more of an appeal to younger people,"" Cox said. ""Plus, Portland is known for its coffee. We thought it was relevant both to the geography and the demographic."" Jesse Ellis O’Brien, a health care advocate with the Oregon State Public Interest Research Group, said Cover Oregon’s campaign makes sense. ""For Cover Oregon to succeed, it has to have a balanced risk pool so people buying coverage in the marketplace aren’t just unhealthy folks buying coverage to take care of their immediate expensive medical needs,"" O’Brien said. ""This is certainly one way for them to try to balance out who is buying insurance on the exchange."" The ad is aimed at Millennials, and the ones who see it are likely to know their way around a fancy cup of coffee well enough to get the comparison to insurance coverage. In addition, one-third of the plans with published rates on Cover Oregon offer coverage to this group for less than the cost of a ""$5 vanilla soy latte."" But words matter, and the ad’s message wouldn’t be accurate for many. Most older people will need to shell out considerably more than $5 a day to buy insurance through Cover Oregon. We find the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/dec/06/cover-oregon/can-health-insurance-plans-be-purchased-cost-5-van/

Medical device makers attribute layoffs partly to Obamacare tax
","A reader asked us to check whether a medical tax in the Obamacare law killed thousands of jobs, as her Texas congressman recently told her via email. U.S. Rep. Ted Poe, whose district covers parts of Harris County, wrote Oct. 24, 2013, just after a partial government shutdown had ended, describing measures fellow Republicans proposed to avert the shutdown while altering or defunding President Barack Obama’s health care law. One amendment, Poe said, would have repealed ""the costly medical device tax, which has led to the loss of thousands of jobs across the nation."" PolitiFact has written about the tax before -- particularly to quash a persistent myth that the outdoor sporting goods chain Cabela’s once charged customers for a medical tax ""hidden in Obamacare."" It’s a 2.3 percent levy on the sale of most medical devices; exceptions include items normally sold directly to the public such as eyeglasses, bandages and hearing aids. The tax, which took effect Jan. 1, 2013, is one of the provisions in the Obamacare law meant to offset costs of expanding health coverage to the uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Poe spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes told us by email, ""Congressman Poe has met with several people in the health care industry who have told him the medical device tax included in the Affordable Care Act has led to thousands of layoffs. We have also read examples of this in the news."" Hynes cited news stories from 2012 and 2013 describing more than 2,000 completed or planned U.S. job cuts that medical device makers attributed in part to the tax. The Republican National Committee rounded up those examples and others in a Sept. 30, 2013, web post. Among them: Citing the tax specifically, Smith & Nephew cut ""nearly 100 jobs"" in Memphis and Andover, Mass., according to a Jan. 31, 2013, news story in the Memphis Daily News. Kalamazoo, Mich.-based medical technology corporation Stryker expected to complete laying off about 1,000 employees worldwide by the end of 2012, according to a Nov. 19, 2012, Kalamazoo Gazette news story. Stryker named the tax as one reason for the cuts in an earlier press release, the story said. The company didn’t give locations for the job cuts, but an earlier warning identified at least 107 in the U.S., the Gazette said. Citing the tax as one reason, Welch Allyn announced 120 buyouts and layoffs in Central New York as part of global cuts, according to a Sept. 10, 2012, Syracuse (N.Y.) Post-Standard news story. Boston Scientific increased planned job cuts worldwide by 900 to 1,000 positions, according to a Jan. 29, 2013, Associated Press news story. Company president Michael Mahoney said the tax played a role, according to a Jan. 30, 2013, Minneapolis Star Tribune news story.   A July 27, 2012, Indiana Business Journal news story said Cook Medical Inc. halted plans to build five plants similar to one employing 300 people; an executive told the Journal the medical tax left the company with ""fewer resources to be able to spend on those kinds of projects."" Medtronic’s CEO predicted in a March 22, 2010, Wall Street Journal news story that the tax would cost his company 1,000 jobs. A May 22, 2013, Star Tribune news story said Medtronic announced 1,000 cuts worldwide in 2012 and 2,000 cuts worldwide in 2013, with about half of the latter in the U.S. The story cited ""pricing pressures and sluggish sales"" for the May 2013 cuts, but didn’t mention the tax. That story said Medtronic competitor St. Jude Medical, another global company, had announced 800 job cuts in 2012. An earlier Star Tribune news story had reported that executives said the tax was one factor. In total, the news stories pinned at least 1,300 job losses inside the U.S., though most companies did not specify where the cuts would fall. The U.S. medical devices industry, said a July 24, 2013, Forbes news story, ""employs 400,000 Americans directly and is indirectly responsible for almost 2 million more that supply and support the highly-skilled workforce."" The GOP web post pointed to a 2011 study financed by the Advanced Medical Technology Association, or AdvaMed. It said that the excise tax would cause 10 percent of device manufacturing to move offshore, leading to the loss of 43,000 U.S. jobs.    PolitiFact Ohio wrote in a 2012 fact-check that analysis by the research service Bloomberg Government found the AdvaMed study was ""not credible."" The publisher of an online journal covering the medical device industry, Brian Johnson of MassDevice.com, told Boston public radio station WBUR in a Sept. 30, 2013, interview, that ""the tax is costing the industry thousands of jobs."" ""In 2012, publicly traded medical device companies cut 10,000 jobs, in part, to brace for the impact of the tax, although it’s impossible to determine how much the tax actually added to those job loss numbers."" By phone, Johnson told us, ""The long and the short of it is that it's nearly impossible to determine if the tax alone was the cause of layoffs, or if the company used the tax as a good cover for layoffs that were going to happen to begin with. The medical device industry is facing some pretty substantial headwinds that have nothing to do with the excise tax,"" such as the high costs associated with negotiating and completing sales of such devices. Cutting to the bottom line, the Boston radio station asked Johnson, ""So, is this really worth shutting the federal government down over? Don’t these guys make billions of dollars a year? Why can’t they just pass that 2.3 percent on to their customers?"" Johnson said hospital purchasing groups have united in a campaign that ""has been effective in keeping most medical device companies from trying to pass the buck,"" and said that because the tax is on all sales, ""even companies that are losing money have to pay it. This means the tax disproportionately harms young, innovative start-up companies."" Also, he said, the industry is skeptical of predictions that business will boom as more people join the health-care system. ""Medical device makers argue that the new enrollees in health insurance plans will be young and not in need of the technology they create, such as cardiac stents, hip and knee implants and surgical devices,"" he said. Our ruling Poe said ""the costly medical device tax"" in the Obamacare law ""has led to the loss of thousands of jobs across the nation."" News stories indicate more than 2,000 such cuts were planned or made partly because of the tax. An industry analyst has said that ""the tax is costing the industry thousands of jobs,"" but also told us that ""it's nearly impossible to determine if the tax alone was the cause of layoffs.""

Sharpton: The people's priorities are a minimum wage hike, a path to citizenship, and gun background checks
","Liberals like to claim that Republican policies are out of step with the views of most Americans. The Rev. Al Sharpton drew on some polling results to argue that point on his MSNBC show Politics Nation. Sharpton teed up his attack with an excerpt from a floor speech by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Boehner: House Republicans are listening. The Senate, the president continue to stand in the way of the people's priorities. Sharpton: The people's priorities? Let's take a look at some of those priorities. 76 percent want an increase in the minimum wage. How about focusing on that? 77 percent want a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. There's a priority you should focus on. And nearly one year after the Newtown tragedy, 89 percent support background checks. We see two facets to Sharpton’s claim. First, do better than three-quarters of Americans support a higher minimum wage, a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and enhanced background checks for gun-buyers? And second, are these ""the people’s priorities""? On the first question, Sharpton largely has it right. For starters, he’s correct about how the congressional GOP’s stance contrasts with that of Americans as a whole. Republicans, with some help from a few Democrats, stymied a Senate bill to require background checks for sales at gun shows and over the web. Most congressional Republicans oppose raising the minimum wage. The idea of a path to citizenship divides the party, but opposition to it is significant and passionate. And Sharpton also has pretty good support for the notion that three-quarters of Americans back each of the three policy positions he cited. Sharpton had a graphic with the poll results and at the bottom were the sources: Quinnipiac University, Gallup and CBS. We reached out to MSNBC to get the specific polls they used but did not hear back. Here is what our research turned up. Sharpton’s claim Quinnipiac Gallup CBS 76% increase minimum wage NA 76% 69% 77% path to citizenship 57% 87% 77% 89% gun buyer background checks 89% 83% 88%   By and large, the polls Sharpton cited back up his claim. On raising the minimum wage and background checks, he chose the highest percentage, but certainly with the latter, all of the results are in the same range. On the matter of citizenship for illegal immigrants, he chose the middle value. There was some variation in the way the polls asked their questions. On the minimum wage, Gallup asked about raising it to $9 an hour, while CBS simply asked if it should be raised and gave no dollar amount. On a pathway to citizenship, Quinnipiac was the outlier because it didn’t include the details of paying fines, waiting 10 years and other conditions before citizenship would be possible. (We’ll get into why that matters below.) On gun background checks, all three asked pretty much the same question. We also looked at other polls to see if they were in line with the ones Sharpton used. The results were mixed, possibly because some polls worded the question differently. We’ve marked those with an asterisk.   Claim NBC/WSJ Pew Bloomberg ABC/WP 76% increase minimum wage 58%* 70% 77% path to citizenship 65%* 74% * 58%* 89% gun buyer background checks 81% 67% *   What we glean from these polls is that support for raising the minimum wage might not be as strong as Sharpton said, but a healthy chunk of the public is behind it. The question on the NBC/Wall Street Journal survey was relatively complex. Pollsters asked people to assess whether they thought increasing it would be good because it would reduce poverty and spur growth, or bad because it would hurt small businesses and make it harder for low-skilled people to find jobs. That definitely was not as simple as asking whether the minimum wage should go up to $9 an hour, as most of the other polls did. Looking at background checks for gun buyers, we again see broad support. The ABC/Washington Post asked people what they thought about the Senate’s failure to pass a background check bill, a change that makes the responses more difficult to compare. Immigration is the thorniest topic and here’s where how the question was asked seemed to make a big difference. Both Bloomberg and NBC/Wall Street Journal put the question two ways. When they simply asked if people supported a pathway to citizenship, support stood at 46 percent in the Bloomberg poll and 52 percent in the NBC/Wall Street Journal survey. When they added details about applicants paying fines, passing a criminal background check and waiting 10 years, opinions sharply spiked towards approval. With the Bloomberg poll, support jumped to 74 percent. In the other, it went to 65 percent. Adding those policy details matches the question to the language in the Senate immigration bill. Where Sharpton’s summary fails to capture an important dimension is on the second part of our inquiry -- do these positions represent the public’s ""priorities""? The reality is that these polls test the public views one issue at a time, and they don’t tell us where voters rank those issues in importance compared to other issues. There is a poll that tackles that question head on. The Pew Research Center for People and the Press has been looking at public’s policy priorities since 1994. The latest findings, from January 2013, show a very different picture than what Sharpton presents. Out of 21 issues, strengthening gun laws and dealing with illegal immigration rank near the bottom at 19 and 18 respectively. Pollsters didn’t ask specifically about the minimum wage. However, improving the job situation ranked second and helping the poor and the needy ranked ninth. It’s possible that raising the minimum wage would fit into those issues but the poll is otherwise silent on this point. Our ruling Sharpton said the ""priorities"" of more than three-quarters of Americans are to increase the minimum wage, create a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and require background checks for gun buyers. Polling generally backs up his claim about how Americans view those three issues, though there’s some variation in the polls, often depending on how the question is worded. However, it does not seem that these issues are ""priorities"" for the American public, as Sharpton claimed. In fact, he used the word three times in the space of a few sentences. So we give that part of the claim significant weight. We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/dec/06/al-sharpton/sharpton-peoples-priorities-raise-minimum-wage/
