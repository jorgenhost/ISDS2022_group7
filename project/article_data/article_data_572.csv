Deal defends comments that bad weather was ""unexpected""
","Motorists stuck for hours and hours on ice-covered roads. Cars abandoned on I-285. Children forced to spend the night in schools. Across metro Atlanta, nearly everyone was saying they had never seen anything like this. At a late-night news conference just hours after the Tuesday chaos began, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal offered his initial assessment. ""As you know, we have been confronted with an unexpected storm that has hit the metropolitan area,"" Deal said. The president of the American Meteorological Society quickly disputed the governor’s statement. ""Some in the public, social media or decision-making positions would ‘blame’ the meteorologists.  I began to hear things like ‘this was not expected in Atlanta’ or ‘they said this was going to all be South of Atlanta’ or there were no Watches or Warnings until snow started falling or ‘weather is just unpredictable.’  Wrong, Wrong, Wrong, and Wrong!"" Marshall Shepherd, the AMA’s president, who also teaches at the University of Georgia, wrote on his blog. Was this storm ""unexpected,"" as Deal said? PolitiFact Georgia trudged in, searching for some answers. Deal and other Georgia leaders, such as Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, have faced withering criticism about their response. Even Al Roker, the gregarious ""Today"" meteorologist based in New York City, took them to task. ""The mayor and the governor got on television yesterday and said, ‘Oh, this wasn’t expected,’ and that’s not true,"" Roker said. ""We were talking about this Monday."" The first question posed to Deal during a testy news conference Wednesday was whether the severe weather was ""expected."" The governor clarified his remarks. Deal said he thought the Atlanta region would not get the worst of the weather conditions, based on some forecasts. Areas south of Atlanta would be in more trouble, Deal said. The governor said the weather reports on the fast-moving storm conflicted. In the face of a flurry of reporter questions, Deal said that some initial forecasts had Atlanta facing only ""a dusting."" ""I think (local forecasters) were more correct than the national weather folks were,"" he said. Some local television meteorologists began warning viewers a snowstorm was headed to Georgia a week beforehand. But it first appeared that the brunt of the storm would strike communities south of metro Atlanta. On Sunday afternoon, the National Weather Service issued a winter storm watch for central Georgia and south metro Atlanta. Before dawn Monday, the watch was expanded to the entire Atlanta region. The National Weather Service said Monday that central Georgia was most likely to see the most snowfall, especially overnight Tuesday, with up to three inches of the white stuff. The big concern in South Georgia, they said, was ice. ""The snowfall amounts are going to matter very little in this situation because of the ice potential,"" said Jason Deese, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Peachtree City, according to The Associated Press. ""Some parts of the state may end up seeing the greatest impact just because they get more ice than snow."" Deese cautioned that the storm’s path was not entirely predictable. ""We have increasing confidence a winter storm is going to affect portions of Georgia,"" Deese said. ""It's just a matter of which portions of Georgia."" The Weather Channel, based in Cobb County, predicted Monday that the brunt of the snow would hit metro Atlanta. ""We could see anywhere from one to three inches here in the metro area,"" a forecaster said. The Georgia Emergency Management Association posted on its Facebook page Tuesday that the heaviest snowfall amounts would be between Macon and metro Atlanta. Southeast areas could expect icing from freezing rain and possible power outages. At 3:38 a.m. Tuesday, the National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for metro Atlanta, starting at 9 a.m. It was at 9 a.m. that the city started pre-treating its roads, Reed told reporters Wednesday. The mayor  said the problem was more complicated than just a weather event. Reed said everyone tried to leave at once just as the storm hit. Major roads, he said, were immediately clogged. Many school districts dismissed classes early, prompting parents to get in their cars to pick up their children. Employers across metro Atlanta told workers to go home early. The situation created a traffic nightmare in the region Tuesday afternoon in an area already jaded by gridlocked commutes. At 12:15 p.m. Tuesday, Deal said area roads were moving smoothly. Twenty minutes later, the governor said the roads were snarled. By evening, temperatures dropped and the roads iced, making it almost impossible to travel. ""The error was letting everyone out at once,"" Reed repeatedly said. Some talk-show callers widely criticized Fulton County school officials for not letting children out earlier Tuesday.  Fulton Superintendent Robert Avossa said Wednesday that the meteorologists and emergency management agencies were originally projecting that the winter storm would hit Tuesday afternoon after school was out. ""As a result, we canceled after-school activities so students and staff would not be delayed in getting home,"" he said. ""Throughout the day Tuesday, it became increasingly apparent that the weather model had changed and that the storm was arriving faster and more severe than expected. The target area also was changing to cover more of Fulton County, especially in the north, whereas the original projections were that it was going to hit south and below Fulton County."" He wasn’t sure the outcome would have been different. ""Several surrounding school systems did (release students earlier) but still experienced similar problems,"" Avossa said. So was the governor correct? Or was his statement part of a blizzard of misinformation.   Deal said the Atlanta region was hit with an ""unexpected"" snowstorm. Deal is correct that some forecasters predicted metro Atlanta would not get the brunt of the storm. The closer the storm came to the region, the more apparent it was that metro Atlanta would see rough weather. Deal’s statement contains an element of truth -- there were conflicting weather reports as the fast-moving storm approached. But there is a lot of context necessary here. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for metro Atlanta before dawn Tuesday. Ultimately, it is the job of elected leaders to make the correct calls based on the best information available. The governor and other elected officials had that information from some sources hours before the storm struck. We rate Deal’s statement as Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E286940>],/factchecks/2014/jan/30/nathan-deal/deal-defends-comments-bad-weather-was-unexpected/
"['Pundits', 'PunditFact', 'Marc Thiessen']","
GOP speechwriter: Obama plagiarized George W. Bush
","Republicans might not have heard much to cheer about in President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address, but a former GOP speechwriter almost felt flattered. Marc Thiessen was the lead writer for President George W. Bush’s 2007 State of the Union speech, and he said he found the similarities between the two speeches a bit eerie. ""There were lines like, ‘Our job is to help Americans build a future of hope and opportunity,"" Thiessen told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly. ""‘A future of hope and opportunity requires that all citizens have affordable and available health care, extending opportunity and hope depends on a stable supply of energy.’ All of that came from the 2007 State of the Union from George W. Bush. ""So Barack Obama has gone from blaming George W. Bush to plagiarizing George W. Bush,""  Thiessen concluded. Plagiarism -- which is to use the words or ideas of another person as if they were your own words or ideas -- is a fairly serious charge, so we decided to look at the substance behind it. We contacted Thiessen, and he said we should look at his statement in context. ""Did Obama copy Bush word-for-word? No,"" Thiessen told us. ""But Obama clearly lifted the repeating theme of his address from Bush's 2007 State of the Union. In Obama's case, it's significant because he is abandoning a liberal theme that was not working (income inequality) in favor of a conservative theme that does (opportunity)."" Thiessen said this wasn’t the first time he felt Obama borrowed heavily from Bush. He said it happened before in an Obama speech on Syria. In this case, Thiessen does well to back away from the zinger he delivered on television. Jonathan Bailey runs a consulting operation and website called Plagiarism Today. Bailey told us Obama’s speech didn’t have what Bailey would call plagiarism. ""It doesn’t appear that any lines were lifted verbatim, or even very close to verbatim,"" Bailey said. First, Obama never said, ""Our job is to help Americans build a future of hope and opportunity,"" or, ""A future of hope and opportunity requires that all citizens have affordable and available health care, extending opportunity and hope depends on a stable supply of energy."" So Thiessen is wrong on that point. Even in more isolated contexts, an accusation of plagiarism appears unjustified. On Fox News, Thiessen mentioned the phrases ""hope and opportunity"" or ""opportunity and hope."" In 2007, Bush used those phrases seven times. Obama never used either of them. In fact, Obama -- who ran his 2008 campaign on a slogan of ""hope""  -- didn’t use that word at all. Bush talked about affordable health care twice. Obama never used that term except when he referred to the Affordable Care Act. (Not that the mention of affordable health care should be considered plagiarism.) Bush spoke of ""energy"" three times; Obama eight. Both presidents also used the word opportunity -- Obama 12 times, Bush nine. The idea of opportunity belongs to both political parties, but it’s a word more typically used by Republicans, both Thiessen and Bailey said. ""Much of the language in Obama’s speech took a more conservative tone, using words and terminology commonly associated with Republicans,"" Bailey said. That said, not everyone agrees that Obama took much of a conservative turn in his speech. According to an analysis from political scientists Benjamin Lauderdale at the London School of Economics and John Sides at George Washington University, Obama’s tone was not much different than it had been in previous years. For fun, we used the website Wordle to generate diagrams showing how many times the two presidents used certain words in their speeches. The similarities and differences are fairly obvious. In 2007, war and terrorism were more pressing than work and jobs are in 2014. In the scheme of things, both presidents invoked ""opportunity"" about the same number of times. Most common words in President George W. Bush’s 2007 State of the Union address   Most common words in President Barack Obama’s 2014 State of the Union address   Our ruling Thiessen said that Obama had gone from blaming George W. Bush to plagiarizing him. Thiessen himself says he didn’t mean that Obama copied Bush; rather, that Obama took the theme of opportunity from Bush. Even if Obama did emphasize a theme Republicans identify with, that in no way matches the popular, or legal, understanding of plagiarism. At PunditFact, we understand that words can be delivered for effect, but we also uphold the principle that words matter. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DA751C0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/29/marc-thiessen/gop-speechwriter-obama-plagiarized-george-w-bush/

Barack Obama, in State of the Union, says women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns
","During his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama made a claim about pay for women in today’s economy. ""You know, today, women make up about half our workforce, but they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns,"" Obama said. ""That is wrong, and in 2014, it's an embarrassment. Women deserve equal pay for equal work."" It was not the first time Obama (or other Democrats) have offered the 77-cent data point -- not by a long shot. A search on the White House website calls up literally dozens of examples of policy papers, blog posts and speeches in which the president cited the 77-cent statistic. He used it in a proclamation for National Equal Pay Day (July 20, 2010), in remarks at a White House forum on women and the economy (April 6, 2012), in a conference call with reporters (June 4, 2012), and remarks on the 50th anniversary of the Equal Pay Act (June 10, 2013), just to cite a few. Before we get into the statistics, we need to explain how we’re approaching this claim in this fact-check. We’ve heard the 77-cent statistic used a lot of different ways, and small changes in wording make a big difference in determining whether it’s accurate or not. The less accurate version -- once offered by Obama himself -- states that women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns for the same work, or in the same job. As we’ll explain below, the data doesn’t show that. By contrast, the more accurate version simply states that women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns, period. That is more accurate (though not without some caveats, also listed below). We struggled a bit with how to classify the claim Obama made in the State of the Union, since his phrasing was somewhat ambiguous. He used the more accurate formulation, but he then followed up two sentences later by saying, ""Women deserve equal pay for equal work."" Did Obama’s ""equal pay for equal work"" line suggest that he believes the 77-cent pay differential refers to statistical comparisons of ""equal work""? Or was this sentence simply a philosophical statement that was distinct from the statistical claim? Ultimately, we decided that Obama’s statement that ""women deserve equal pay for equal work"" was aspirational rather than a part of his statistical claim, so we’re judging him on his claim that women ""make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns."" Here’s a rundown of what we’ve found in the past, updated for the most recent data. Ratios vary depending on the methodology The basic federal data comes from two agencies -- the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the two agencies’ numbers don’t exactly agree. The Census Bureau, which tracks annual wages, found women who worked full-time, year-round in 2012 made 77 cents for every dollar men earned across the country -- a percentage in line with what it’s been for the last few years. This comparison includes all male and female workers regardless of occupation. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses a different measures to analyze the pay gap, including weekly wages. BLS found that women who worked full time in wage and salary jobs had median usual weekly earnings of $669 in 2012, which was 82 percent of men’s median weekly earnings. This, too, was in line with the ratio in recent years. What’s the difference? Unlike the measure of annual wages by the Census Bureau, the weekly wage analysis does not account for people who are self-employed. It does include people left out of the year-round wage measure, such as some teachers, construction workers and seasonal workers. Another measure -- hourly rates -- shows a smaller degree of pay disparity. According to BLS data, women were paid 86 percent of the median hourly wages of men in 2012. This evaluation accounts for part-time (fewer than 35 hours) workers, which are more often women and are paid less than their salaried counterparts. Women paid by the hour made median hourly earnings of $11.99, compared to $13.88 for men. However, this figure excludes salaried workers -- another reason why the statistics differ. Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, told PolitiFact in 2012 that the measure of annual wages is preferable, since it doesn’t exclude salaried workers. ""It’s the one that goes back the furthest in time,"" she said. ""It’s the one that is most traditional."" But some researchers, such as the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, prefer working with hourly wages, arguing ""an incomplete picture"" is cast with weekly earnings because women work fewer hours than men, ""which would make a gap in weekly earnings between the two groups substantial even if their hourly wages are the same."" In other words, there’s a range of professional opinion on what the data shows. Differences in jobs held It’s important to point out a few additional caveats. First, there’s a significant variation in wage gaps from occupation to occupation. The Institute for Women’s Policy research looked at pay parity for the top 20 occupations for women in 2011 using median weekly earnings. The center found the pay gap varied depending on the sector, though women lag in nearly every category. Nurses (96 cents for every dollar) and cashiers (90 cents) were closer than most; accountants (77 cents) and financial advisers (66 cents) were more divergent than most. Second, it’s important to note that the existence of a pay gap doesn’t necessarily mean that the gap is caused by individual employer-level discrimination. Rather, some portion is likely the result of broader demographic patterns. For instance, men and women historically enter certain fields more than others -- a phenomenon known as ""occupational segregation."" Women more often choose to be receptionists, nurses and teachers, while men pursue paths as truck drivers, managers and computer software engineers, according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. When data from all these fields is combined together, as in the Census and BLS studies, the gap is at least partially explained by the predominance of women in lower-paying fields, rather than women necessarily being paid less for the same job than men are. In addition, women disproportionately obtain degrees that lead to lower-paying jobs than men, and they take more time off from work for pregnancy and child care, according to a 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh. Despite the growth in fathers’ role in child care, the child-care burden shouldered by women tends to restrict their career options and hours worked. While such patterns raise important policy questions, they don’t necessarily point to discrimination per se. So how much of a role does discrimination play? Hartmann attributed anywhere from one-quarter to one-third of the gap to direct discrimination by the employer. A U.S. Labor Department blog post put it a bit higher -- around 40 percent. The CONSAD paper suggested that when you control for every factor but discrimination, the gap shrunk to between 93 cents and 95 cents -- not zero, but significantly smaller than the 77-cent figure Obama used. When we checked with the White House, a spokesman acknowledged that there is more than one way to calculate the gender pay gap, and that discrimination isn’t the only factor causing the gap. But the spokesman added that it would be wrong to ignore how discrimination and differences in workplace flexibility impact occupational choice. Our ruling Obama said women ""make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns."" It's worth noting that the entire 77-cent gap is not necessarily due to discrimination -- a conclusion some listeners might have drawn when hearing Obama mention ""equal pay for equal work"" shortly after citing the 77-cent figure. And there are alternative calculations that show a smaller overall gap. Still, the 77-cent ratio is a credible figure from a credible agency. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54EA0C200>],/factchecks/2014/jan/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-state-union-says-women-make-77-cents-/

Business leaders declared 'China is no longer the world’s No. 1 place to invest; America is,' Obama says
","President Barack Obama made multiple claims about the improving U.S. economy during his 2014 State of the Union address, touting the nation’s resilience. After making claims about jobs, energy and the deficit, Obama had this to say about international business: ""And for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world’s No. 1 place to invest; America is."" It was one of only two times during the speech the president mentioned China, long considered the ascendant rival of the U.S., and the second-largest economy in the world. (The other mention was about using export partnerships to create jobs.) Considering the breakneck growth of China’s economy, the claim piqued our curiosity. A White House spokesman said the comment referred to the 2013 A.T. Kearney Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, a survey of corporate executives from 302 companies in 28 countries that measured where companies are looking to make global investments. The top highlight: The United States took the No. 1 spot for the first time since 2001. Country Index value (0-3) 2013 rank 2012 rank 2010 rank United States 2.09 1 4 2 China 2.02 2 1 1 Brazil 1.97 3 3 4 Canada 1.86 4 20 9 India 1.85 5 2 3 Australia 1.83 6 6 7 Germany 1.83 7 5 5 United Kingdom 1.81 8 8 10 Mexico 1.77 9 - 8 Singapore 1.77 10 7 - Note: A.T. Kearney did not conduct a survey in 2011 This index -- in its 13th edition since 1998 -- is not a measure of actual dollars being brought in, but rather the confidence global companies have investing in certain nations in the future. A.T. Kearney, a global management consulting firm, said in its June 2013 report that foreign direct investment -- injecting money into a country’s economy by either buying a company or expanding an existing company -- in the United States is still down from the 2008 high of $306 billion, bringing in $167.7 billion in 2012. The index’s outlook is based on business leaders’ attitudes toward political, economic and regulatory changes and their potential effects on foreign investments. Corporate, regional and local business managers responding to the survey said China’s rising labor costs and focus on shifting to a consumer economy took some of the shine off the economic powerhouse, although 73 percent of the respondents said they would maintain holdings in the country. Meanwhile, partisan brinksmanship in the U.S. government made investors wary, but they were optimistic thanks to a favorable dollar, a slow but steady recovery and increasing U.S. manufacturing productivity. In all, 63 percent of respondents expected some growth in America’s economy. Even as the survey was taken amid the 2012 elections and budget fight, the U.S. was considered ""a bedrock of stability among developed nations,"" the 2013 index report said. Is saying the U.S. is now the ""No. 1 place to invest"" an accurate portrayal of the results? A.T. Kearney director of communications Doug MacDonald said yes. ""In terms of our index, it does,"" he told PolitiFact. ""Ours actually asks business leaders what markets they’re looking forward to investing in."" But what about other indices? A comparable study -- albeit with different measurement criteria -- is the Milken Institute’s Global Opportunity Index, which lists the United States as 22nd among 98 countries. That study tracked nations’ abilities to attract foreign direct investment by measuring factors across ""economic fundamentals, regulatory barriers, ease of doing business, regulatory quality, and the rule of law."" Released in March 2013, the Milken Institute’s report was created with 2011 data, and lists China as No. 1. There are also similar rankings from business media outlets. In December, Forbes ranked the United States 14th out of 145 nations in its ""Best Countries for Business"" list. The annual rating placed Hong Kong at No. 3 and Ireland at No. 1, based on ""11 different metrics including property rights, innovation, taxes, technology, corruption, freedom (personal, trade and monetary), red tape, investor protection and stock market performance."" Bloomberg rated the United States second, behind leader Hong Kong, in its own ""Best Countries for Business 2013."" That ranking, based on ""six broad criteria that included the cost of starting a business, the cost of labor and materials and the cost of moving goods,"" placed China a distant 24th. Our ruling Obama said that ""for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world’s No. 1 one place to invest; America is."" He was referring to the 2013 A.T. Kearney Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, which surveys global business leaders to determine their investment attitudes toward nations across the world. The United States did top the list this year, for the first time since 2001, knocking China out of the top slot.  The president is accurate by citing one particular study, and that study did ask business leaders what they thought about investing in the United States. A broader look at other rankings doesn’t make the United States seem like such a powerhouse, even if it does still best China in some lists.

Obama says every four minutes, another home or business goes solar
","President Barack Obama touted his energy strategy during his State of the Union speech. He called for safe extraction of natural gas, reducing our dependence on foreign oil and setting new standards for trucks -- and he shined a spotlight on solar power. ""It’s not just oil and natural gas production that’s booming; we’re becoming a global leader in solar, too,"" Obama said. ""Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar; every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job can’t be outsourced."" That timetable sounded like a rapid expansion of solar: Does a home or business go solar every four minutes? We’ll shed a little light on this claim. Solar expansion Obama’s claim came from Greentech Media (GTM), which published the statistic in August in its Solar Market Research Report, a project with the Solar Energy Industries Association. GTM provides quarterly and annual reports that contain solar-specific analysis and forecasts for industry professionals. A GTM chart shows how solar installations have rapidly increased in recent years from one every 80 minutes in 2006 to one every four minutes in 2013. ""A lot happens in America every four minutes,"" wrote GTM  in an August blog about their research. ""During that short time period, 30 babies are born, 4,080 McDonald's Big Macs are consumed, and 48,000 tons of CO2 are emitted. And as it turns out, the U.S. is now installing one solar photovoltaic (PV) system every four minutes as well. If market growth continues at its current pace, the American solar industry could be installing a system every minute and twenty seconds by 2016."" Every quarter GTM collects the number of solar installations from utilities and state agencies. Researchers get data from 28 states (including Florida ) which represents about 97 percent of the market and devise an estimate for the remaining states, said Shayle Kann, senior vice president of research. GTM has been tracking the solar market since 2009 and collected this particular detailed data since 2010. (Kann said that the U.S. Energy Information Administration has some data on solar installations but not to the level of detail that GTM requires for quarterly reports.) In 2013, there were about 132,000 installations, and there were 525,600 minutes, so the math works out to about one installation every four minutes. GTM is finalizing the number of installations in 2013 -- GTM says it’s possible it could have been higher. Part of the reason for the rapid growth is that the cost of solar panels and installation has dropped, Kann said. Experts on alternative energy generally agreed with GTM’s research but offered some caveats. ""Solar is growing, but from a very small number...,"" said Christopher Bronk, director of the Program on Energy and Cybersecurity at Rice University. According to the  November electric power monthly report from the Energy Information Administration, ""PV solar energy accounts for about 1.5 percent of all electricity generated from renewable sources and .2 percent percent of all the electricity generated."" And not surprisingly, solar is more common in some states than others. ""As you move to places with a lot more cloud cover, let’s say Washington, D.C., then solar energy isn’t going to work as well,"" said Stephen P.A. Brown, an expert in energy economics at the University of Nevada. ""Unless there is some huge change in technology it’s not projected to be the dominant form of energy any time soon or in fact ever."" Our ruling During the State of the Union, Obama said, ""Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar."" Obama obtained that figure from an August report from Greentech Media. Solar has been expanding, but it remains a small slice of the overall market.

Rick Scott says his K-12 education budget proposal is highest in Florida's history
","Gov. Rick Scott may have signed a $1.3 billion cut to K-12 education in his first year, but he’s now touting ""record"" funding for public schools and teacher pay raises later in his term. Scott unveiled his education budget proposal at a Delray Beach elementary school on Jan. 27, 2014. In an accompanying press release, he said, ""The $18.8 billion in funding for K-12 education funding is the highest in Florida history and includes a record $10.6 billion in state funds."" We wondered: If the state Legislature goes along with Scott’s request, would $18.8 billion in total -- including the state’s portion of $10.6 -- be the highest in Florida history? Let’s pull out our calculators and budget documents from past years and find out. Total dollars Scott made similar claims about proposing record K-12 education spending last year. To determine whether a budget proposal is a ""record,"" we have to examine the total size of the pot, the state portion and the per-pupil spending. The Florida Education Finance Program, the main source of dollars for K-12 education, is by law a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars called the ""required local effort,"" with an amount dictated by the state. In some recent years, the state has also received federal stimulus dollars. In 2013, Scott signed a budget that included $18.3 billion for K-12 education, including the state’s contribution of $10.5 billion for 2013-14. Scott’s $18.8 billion proposal for 2014-15 -- including $10.6 billion in state dollars -- would be an increase by about $542 million in raw dollars. (Of course, we’ll have to wait to see if the Legislature goes along with that plan when it convenes in March.) But that doesn’t fully answer the question about whether Scott is on track for record K-12 education spending. Per-pupil spending That’s because another way to compare education funding over time is to look at per-pupil spending. Scott’s budget request equals $6,949 per student, compared with $6,780 this year. That means Scott requested a per-pupil increase of about $169. (That’s an estimate, since we don’t know yet how many more or fewer students the state will have next year.) The problem for Scott is that $6,949 per student is not a record for per pupil spending. A chart comparing state spending over a decade through Scott’s recommendation last year show that per-pupil funding peaked in 2007-08 -- before the recession -- at $7,126. At the time, Charlie Crist was governor; he was then a Republican and is now running as a Democrat against Scott to win his old job back. In 2007-08 Florida had about 67,000 fewer students than it does today, and the state spent more money per student. Inflation Another way to measure whether Scott is proposing a record amount of spending is to use an inflation calculator, in order to fairly compare amounts spent during different years. If we take the $9.7 billion in state spending for 2007-08 and adjust for inflation, it would equal about $10.5 billion in 2013 -- so Scott would still be correct that his proposed $10.6 billion in state spending is higher. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index inflation calculator doesn’t show 2014 yet.) But if we take the total spending for 2007-08 -- $18.75 billion -- and adjust for inflation, that would equal $20.29 billion in 2013, which is still higher than Scott’s recommendation for total spending of $18.8 billion. Our ruling Scott said of his budget proposal that ""the $18.8 billion in funding for K-12 education funding is the highest in Florida history and includes a record $10.6 billion in state funds."" He is correct that both the sheer dollar total and the state’s portion are larger than in past years. However, per-pupil spending was higher under Crist. Also, factoring in inflation for the total amount for 2007-08 would make it larger than Scott’s current proposal. On balance, we rate Scott’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E238B00>],/factchecks/2014/jan/29/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-his-k-12-education-budget-proposal/

John Cornyn recently wrote: ""January is National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, a sobering reminder that even as we enter the year 2014, people around the world continue to be victims of slavery and human trafficking. ""Tragically, these horrendous crimes are occurring at an alarming rate in our own state,"" the Texas Republican said. ""25% of human trafficking victims are located in Texas."" The email went on to mention Cornyn’s introduction of legislative proposals to ""help law enforcement track down and prosecute these criminals, and provide support for the victims of these crimes."" Merriam-Webster defines human trafficking as ""organized criminal activity in which human beings are treated as possessions to be controlled and exploited (as by being forced into prostitution or involuntary labor)."" Are one in four of all trafficking victims located in Texas? Megan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Cornyn, who seeks election to a third term, told us by email that the senator relied on an undated ""fact sheet"" from the Texas Sex Trafficking Obliteration Project, overseen by the conservative Concerned Women of America, and a Sept. 16, 2009, report by Texas-based Children at Risk, a nonprofit focused on the ""root causes of poor public policies affecting children."" The sheet says: ""25% of all human trafficking victims are in Texas,"" attributing that without elaboration to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ‘Certified’ victims only The Children at Risk report gives detail, stating: ""In the last quarter of 2007, 30% of the calls received by the National Human Trafficking Hotline originated in Texas and 25% of all international victims certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services were located in Texas. As of the date (of) publication, the National Human Trafficking Hotline receives more calls from Texas than from any other state."" According to the report, Texas is a ""hub for international human trafficking because of its many busy interstate highways, international airports, bus stations, the shipping commerce through the Gulf of Mexico, and its shared border with Mexico… Texas is also a hotspot for domestic human trafficking because cities such as Dallas, Houston and Austin have many runaway and homeless youth."" By email, Dawn Lew, a staff attorney for Children at Risk, told us the reference to the last quarter of 2007 applied only to the hotline calls and said the 25 percent reference reflected the percentage of all international trafficking victims ""certified"" by the HHS who were located in Texas from April 2004 through January 2006. Also, Lew pointed us toward a web page for the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, dated Oct. 2, 2012, stating that under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, adult victims of severe forms of trafficking in the country from another place can become eligible for federal and state services otherwise offered to refugees. To qualify, individuals must be ""certified"" as trafficking victims by HHS, according to the web page, meaning they must: be a victim of a severe form of trafficking; be willing to assist in every reasonable way in the investigation and prosecution of severe forms of trafficking or be unable to cooperate due to physical or psychological trauma; and have cleared immigration paperwork hurdles. Child victims do not need such certification, the page says. Lew subsequently noted a July 2012 federal report stating that in 2002, certification letters for 99 individuals were sent to benefit-issuing offices in 14 states. The report said: ""The largest concentrations of victims were located in Texas (31.3%), Florida (19.2%), and California (14.1%)."" Another Children at Risk official called and said Cornyn’s statement could have been worded differently. The official, Mandi Kimball, later said by email that Cornyn’s 25 percent reference was in the context of talking up his legislation targeting trafficking within the United States. ""We have no idea how many people are being trafficked in Texas or any state for that matter,"" Kimball wrote. ""We do know that 25% of the"" foreign ""victims located and certified in the country from April 2004-January 2006 were located in Texas. Cornyn is not saying that 25% of the victims were being trafficked in Texas, he stated that they were located in Texas. This is the 25% number that people are going by, because it is the only concrete data and number we have to go by, and this data is from"" HHS. Do these counts add up? Generally, Lew said earlier, states are under-estimating trafficking victims. ""This is because it is difficult and nearly impossible to quantify the true number of victims,"" Lew said. ""Why? Because victims often don’t self-identify as victims, some are misidentified and charged as criminals for related offenses (drugs, criminal trespass, etc.), and others, due to the clandestine nature of human trafficking, are hiding in plain sight and may never encounter law enforcement or social service providers,"" Lew wrote. ""In addition, although human trafficking has always existed, until recently, not all states even had a state law on human trafficking, which contributes to the lack of information at the state level on the number of victims identified, traffickers convicted, etc.,"" Lew said. ""Certification numbers are some of the only concrete data that we have with respect to the number of human trafficking victims in each state, and it’s clear that many of the victims are being certified from Texas. Again, keep in mind that certification only captures a percentage of international victims, and does not include domestic victims at all. So the problem in Texas, as in most every state, is larger."" At Lew’s suggestion, we reached Maria Trujillo, executive director of the Houston Rescue and Restore Coalition, which says its mission is educate the public, train professionals and empower the community to act toward identifying, rescuing and restoring trafficking victims to freedom. By phone, Trujillo said the Cornyn-cited statistic may have held up in 2006--though then solely for adult victims from outside the United States, since certification does not sweep in citizen-victims. Also, she said, the government has not released figures since then that would bring the estimate up to date. After 2006, Trujillo said, the government stopped estimating the number of certified adult victims on a state-by-state level, though national figures continued to be available. Kenneth Wolfe, spokesman for the Administration for Children and Families, which is an HHS agency, told us by email that it is unable to calculate how many victims of human trafficking are in the United States or within any state. Wolfe said the agency has not lately reported which states got the most letters certifying international victims ""because the information might be misinterpreted as the location of the trafficking, which is often not the case."" Nationally in the fiscal year that ran through September 2011, he said, such letters were provided to victims or their representatives in 38 states. Certified victims, he said, came from 55 countries. Texas vs. the world We were curious to see how the scope of trafficking in Texas stacks up with other places in the world, some of them notorious for human trafficking. Cornyn’s statement, after all, said that 25 percent of trafficking victims are in Texas just one sentence after he said that ""people around the world continue to be victims of slavery and human trafficking."" Globally, Trujillo said, the only recent estimate of trafficking victims that she recommends came from the International Labour Federation, a United Nations agency, which estimated there were nearly 21 million victims in 2012. ""I am comfortable with that figure, I am comfortable with their research,"" Trujillo said. ""... It is still an estimate. No one can ever know the true number because it is such a covert crime."" A U.N. report published in December 2012 describes the organization’s estimate of 20.9 million individuals in forced labor, including for sexual exploitation. ""While it is not known how many of these victims were trafficked, the estimate implies that currently, there are millions of trafficking-in-persons victims in the world,""  the report says, further specifying that per U.S. State Department figures, there were 449 adults and 92 children from foreign countries certified as U.S. victims of trafficking in the fiscal year that ran through September 2010. The U.N. agency’s executive summary describes the survey-based methodology for its estimate, also saying that Asia accounts for 56 percent of the estimated global total with Africa accounting for 18 percent of victims. ""Developed economies"" including the United States, the summary says, account for 1.5 million, or 7 percent, of the victims. Informed of the unavailability of recent estimates and the fact that the original estimate was limited to certified victims from outside the country, Mitchell of Cornyn’s office said by email that his statement relied on the ""most recent Texas-specific data available."" Our ruling Cornyn said 25 percent of trafficking victims are located in Texas. This claim seemingly draws on an outdated percentage for a subset of the planet’s trafficking victims, that is, ""certified"" adult victims from outside the U.S. described some five years ago as located in Texas from April 2004 through January 2006--and that calculation did not account for U.S. citizen-victims. We did not find an estimate of the share of the world’s trafficking victims located in Texas, though the 2012 U.N. estimate seems to show that Texas is not home to a huge share; victims are more prevalent in Asia and Africa than in the developed world, the report said. All told, this claim shakes out as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

"['States', 'Virginia', 'Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus']","
Senate Democrats U-turn on power sharing
","Democrats’ views on power sharing in the state Senate have come a long way. Each political party controls 20 seats in the state Senate, just like they did two years ago. But the the Democrats senators’ view has hardened now that they have the tie-breaking vote. Let’s go back to November 2011 elections when Republicans gained two Senate seats, splitting the partisan count in the chamber down the middle and setting the stage for GOP Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling to cast tie-breaking votes on legislation.   A few weeks later, Republicans decreed that Bolling’s tie-breaking vote also applied to Senate rules and that with his support, they would they would push through a reorganization that would give the GOP chairmanship of all committees. Democrats protested, saying Bolling’s tie-breaking powers did not give him a say in establishing the internal rules of the Senate. Sen. Donald McEachin, D-Henrico, said ""Bolling is not a member of the Senate,"" and unsuccessfully asked a judge to stop the reorganization. McEachin, the chairman of the chamber’s Democratic caucus, denounced the GOP’s reorganization as ""an arrogant power grab."" Sen. Richard L. Saslaw, a Fairfax County Democrat who stood to lose his post as majority leader, agreed. ""Virginians elected 20 senators of each party, and it’s only right the power in the Senate is divided equally,"" Saslaw told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. ""The Republicans are trying to overrule the will of the people and claim a majority they did not earn."" On Jan. 11, 2012, Senate Republicans, with Bolling’s support, pushed through a resolution giving their party chairmanships of all the committees and majority membership on the major panels. The measure passed on a 21-20 vote. ""It’s grossly unfair to the citizens of Virginia who voted for a 20-20 Senate,"" said Sen. John S. Edwards, D-Roanoke, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. ""I think the citizens of Virginia want the Senate of Virginia to engage in a power-sharing agreement."" But Republicans were not sympathetic. Sen. Tommy Norment, who was poised to become the new majority leader, said the reorganization was a ""rearticulation of Senate rules"" that the GOP found ""appropriate."" Now, let’s flash forward. In November 2013, Democrat Ralph Northam was elected lieutenant governor. And this Monday, Democrat Lynwood Lewis was declared the winner of a special election to take Northam’s seat in the Senate. On Tuesday, Lewis was sworn in, giving Democrats a 21-20 edge with Northam’s tie-breaking vote. That  allowed the Democrats to push through their own reorganization on a series of 21-20 votes. Democrats gave themselves the leadership of all committees -- although it should be noted they agreed to share the chairmanship of the powerful Finance Committee with Republican Walter Stosch, a bipartisan gesture the GOP was unwilling to make two years ago. Echoing Republican actions of 2012, the Democrats gave themselves majorities on all committees but two: Local Government; and Rehabilitation and Social Services. Republicans, perhaps mindful of their actions two years ago, did not call on the Democrats to share power or contest the lieutenant governor’s right to break the tie votes. But they did complain about several new precedents the Democrats set, including one that would empower the Rules Committee to kill Senate bills that are ""significantly amended"" by the Republican-led House of Delegates. In the past, House amendments to Senate bills were considered by the full Senate. The Democrats’ reorganization plan was authored by McEachin -- the same person who called the GOP takeover two years ago ""an arrogant power grab."" McEachin said his change of view this year is rooted in the GOP’s actions two years ago. During debate, he frequently repeated Norment’s 2012 line about ""a rearticulation of Senate rules."" Saslaw, in a written statement after the vote, said time have changed. ""We now have a majority and we have a responsibility to use that majority to work on the issues voters care about,"" he wrote. No doubt, the Senate Democrats have U-turned on power sharing. We rate it a ""Full Flop."" Correction: A comment made by Sen. Richard Saslaw was incorrectly attributed to Sen. Donald McEachin in an earlier version of this story. The attribution has been corrected in this updated post.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E0394C0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/29/virginia-senate-democratic-caucus/senate-democrats-u-turn-power-sharing/

Barack Obama says the minimum wage was higher during Ronald Reagan's first State of the Union
","During his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama made a pitch for an increase in the minimum wage to $10.10. ""Easy to remember,"" Obama said of the proposal. (Not quite as catchy as Herman Cain's 9-9-9 plan, but close.) In trying to gain support from Republicans, Obama invoked their conservative idol. ""Today, the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here,"" Obama said of the former president. It’s a point Obama has tried to make before. We saw him use the comparison last year in a speech on the economy in Galesburg, Ill. As we noted then, if you compare the minimum wages between the two eras at face value, it’s not close. The minimum wage under all eight years of Reagan’s presidency was $3.35; today the federal minimum wage is $7.25, and has been since 2009. It’s pretty clear, then, that Obama is referring to the inflation-adjusted minimum wage rate. By that measure, the minimum wage was higher from 1981 to 1984, during Reagan's first term.  How much higher? Using the Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator, we were able to figure that out. Percent difference with current wage   In 1981, the minimum wage, adjusted to inflation was $8.61. Today’s mark of $7.25 is 15.6 percent less. That’s not quite 20 percent as Obama said, but it’s in the ballpark (exactly 20 percent less would put today’s minimum wage at $6.87). But if you take a look, you’ll see that adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage dropped every year of Reagan’s presidency. Today’s minimum wage is 15 percent more than what it was in 1989. As we pointed out in a previous fact check, Reagan was the only president never to oversee a boost in the minimum wage. So invoking the Gipper to push a minimum wage hike is a tough sell. We reached out to the White House. They sent us minimum wage figures adusted for inflation similar to what we calculated (about 18.8 percent higher in 1981, by their numbers). Our ruling Obama said, ""the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan"" gave his first State of the Union address. Obama's not far off, but it’s actually closer to 16 percent less. And using Reagan to make a case to raise the minimum wage should be taken with a grain of salt since the former president never increased it during his two terms. And by Reagan’s last State of the Union, the minimum wage was $2 less than when he first took office, if you factor in inflation. The statement is largely accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. UPDATE, Jan. 29, 2014: After we published this story, an alert reader noted that our original paraphrase of part of Obama's quote was inaccurate. We had written that Obama had said ""the federal minimum wage is worth about 20 percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan"" gave his first State of the Union address. As the reader pointed out, a new president's first address to a joint session of Congress -- the 1981 speech that Obama was referring to -- is not officially called a State of the Union address. So we have rewritten our paraphrase in the ruling statement above to remove the reference to the State of the Union. It does not affect the rating of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54C6720C0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-minimum-wage-was-higher-during-r/

Rep. McMorris Rodgers says more people stopped looking for a job than found one
","After President Barack Obama delivered his State of the Union address, which focused largely on his plans to boost the economic well-being of struggling Americans, Republicans responded with their own approach. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., said her party’s mission was to close the gap ""between where you are and where you want to be."" McMorris Rodgers blamed the president and his policies for that gap and noted that ""last month, more Americans stopped looking for a job than found one."" In this fact-check, we examine that claim. The congresswoman’s staff pointed us to numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In December, the nation added about 74,000 jobs. But in that same month, the labor force shrunk by 347,000. There are several problems with this comparison. The biggest is that a large portion of those people who left the workforce simply retired. We don’t know exactly how many, but it is a demographic reality that an ever growing number of Americans are getting older. Based on federal data, Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, has calculated that the percentage of the adult population over 55 has risen from 27 percent in 1999-2000 to 32 percent in 2011-12. Burtless has estimated that half to two-thirds of the recent decline in the labor participation rate has been due to the aging of the population, depending on the time period you look at. Economists say that a tough job market has led thousands of people to retire earlier than they might have. But the raw numbers don’t give us a clear picture. The Bureau of Labor Statistics asks questions that give us some clues but not a definitive answer. The data on ""discouraged workers"" counts people who looked for a job in the past year but did not during the last month. And the reason they didn’t look, according to the bureau, might have been that there was no work available, that employers thought they were too young or too old, or that the people didn’t have the skills needed to compete for the openings they found. By using December numbers, McMorris Rodgers has cherry-picked a more dire statistic. In that month, the number of discouraged workers rose by 155,000. That is higher than the 74,000 jobs the economy gained. But looking back at the other months throughout the year, a different picture emerges. During 2013, there were only two months, June and December, when the number of discouraged workers grew by more than the number of new jobs added. The monthly numbers are not fully comparable because the discouraged worker count is not seasonally adjusted and the number of jobs is. But with that caveat, the overall trend for the year is more positive because the number of new jobs exceeded discouraged workers. Our ruling McMorris Rodgers said more people stopped looking for a job than found one in December. The congresswoman relied on figures that included a large fraction of people who retired from the workforce and she cherry-picked one of only two months in 2013 that supported her claim. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54C834400>],/factchecks/2014/jan/29/cathy-mcmorris-rodgers/rep-mcmorris-rodgers-says-more-people-stopped-look/

Barack Obama, in State of the Union, says U.S. has cut carbon pollution more than any other country
","In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama boasted about progress on climate change, citing reductions in carbon emissions. ""Taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet,"" he said. ""Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth. But we have to act with more urgency – because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought, and coastal cities dealing with floods."" We wondered whether Obama was correct that ""over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth."" We turned to data from the Energy Information Administration, a trusted source for all types of energy data run by the U.S. Energy Department. The agency has a table showing ""total carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption of energy."" The data shows a mixed picture. Obama is correct if you measure the total reduction in carbon emissions. Between 2003 and 2011 -- the latest eight-year period for which data is available -- the United States’ carbon emissions fell from 5.853 billion metric tons to 5.490 billion metric tons. That’s a reduction of 363 million metric tons -- far larger than any other country. However, the statistic is not as enlightening as it would seem, because it fails to account for the relative size of countries.

A more useful comparison is to measure the percentage reduction for countries all around the world. We looked at the largest nations -- those with at least 100 million tons of carbon emissions in 2011 -- and found six other nations that managed to cut their carbon emissions more steeply than the United States did during the past eight years. They are: Greece: -15 percent Germany: -14 percent United Kingdom: - 13 percent Belgium: -13 percent France: -8 percent Spain: -8 percent United States: -6 percent To be fair, many nations increased their emissions over that period -- including such big economies as China, India and Russia -- and in this context, the scale of the United States’ cuts is impressive. Still, this suggests that a half-dozen advanced industrialized economies made emissions cuts that were larger, proportionately, than the United States achieved. Our ruling Obama said, ""Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth."" Looked at by the total amount of emission reductions, Obama is right. But when you look at the scale of the cuts proportionately -- which puts nations on a more equal footing when making comparisons -- the United States did not achieve the kind of steep cuts that other industrialized countries did.

In State of the Union, Obama says U.S. produces more oil than it buys
","In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama noted the country’s progress toward energy independence. There is ""more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world – the first time that’s happened in nearly 20 years,"" he said. Later in the speech, he added, ""The all-of-the-above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to energy independence than we’ve been in decades."" Earlier in January, we fact-checked Obama’s same claim about domestic oil production after he spoke at North Carolina State University. We rated it True after PolitiFact dug into the U.S. oil numbers. Here’s what we had found: A White House spokesman offered up this White House blog post that explained Obama’s point in more detail. According to the White House, Domestic crude oil production surpassed crude oil imports in October 2013 for the first time since 1995. We also consulted the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to their November 2013 report, the United States produced an average of 7.8 million barrels of oil per day in October and imported 7.5 million barrels of oil per day. So Obama’s numbers add up. How did we arrive at this point? Kenneth Medlock, an economics professor at Rice University who serves as the senior director for the Center for Energy Studies, said there are a couple of reasons why production exceeds imports. ""Yes, we are producing more than we import now, but that owes to both increased production domestically and reduced demand,""Medlock said. The reduced demand is due in part to the recession. It’s no surprise that people cut back on gasoline consumption when there’s less money in their wallets, so that lowers demand. And if demand is down, the United States doesn’t need to import as much oil supply. Another cause of reduced demand is increased energy efficiency. Over the last few years, rising popularity of fuel-efficient vehicles and other innovations have led consumers and businesses to spend less on utilities and at the pump, said John Lowe, a senior associate dean and energy law professor at Southern Methodist University. Aside from reduced demand, Medlock also mentioned increased production as another reason the United States is producing more oil than it's importing. We can credit increased domestic production to innovation in regulatory infrastructure. That includes factors like the ability for companies to negotiate directly with private landowners about mineral rights, as well as open access to pipelines. But we can’t tie these developments back to one president, Medlock said. They go back a couple of decades. Still, it’s worth noting that Obama is a known supporter of energy efficiency. When he campaigned for office, he promised to reduce the country’s dependency on foreign oil. In 2012, we rated that Promise Kept based on projections of the impact of his administration’s fuel efficiency standards. Our ruling Obama said the United States is producing more oil at home than its buying from the rest of the world for the first time in nearly two decades. That claim is on the money. However, a lot of this has been in the works for awhile, including dynamics that pre-date the Obama administration. Experts told us the new dynamic is due to factors like the recession, increased fuel efficiency and ramped up domestic oil production. As a simple statement on where we stand on oil exports vs. imports, though, Obama’s claim is accurate. We rate it True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E3BD1C0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/29/barack-obama/state-union-obama-says-us-produces-more-oil-it-buy/

In State of the Union, Obama says average wages have 'barely budged' over past 4 years
","One of the key themes of President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address was income inequality. ""Today, after four years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done better,"" Obama said. ""But average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled. The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by - let alone get ahead. And too many still aren't working at all."" Here, we will check Obama’s claim that during the past four years, ""average wages have barely budged."" At PolitiFact, one of our core principles is ""words matter."" So in this item, we will look at average wages -- not the median wage, and not the average (or median) family income or household income. We found two federal data sets that look at the average wage. • The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates These statistics are based on data collected from employers in all industry sectors and in all types of regions nationwide. The most recent year available is 2012.   Year Mean annual wage, all occupations Inflation-adjusted mean annual wage in 2012 dollars 2008 $42,270 $45,076 2009 $43,460 $46,510 2010 $44,410 $46,760 2011 $45,230 $46,166 2012 $45,790 $45,790   So according to this data set, the average annual wage increased by 8.3 percent between 2008 and 2012. (We also looked at the changes between 2009 and 2012, since either date range seems a plausible ""four-year"" period to us, and the numbers were similar..) However, this raw wage data doesn’t take into account inflation -- something economists like to consider when determining whether a wage ""barely budged."" When you use an inflation calculator, the average wage from 2008 was equivalent to $45,075 in 2012 dollars, meaning that the inflation-adjusted wage rose during that period, but only narrowly -- about 1.6 percent. By this data, Obama is correct. • The Social Security Administration's National Average Wage Index These are the numbers used to calculate Social Security recipients’ benefit levels. Here’s the breakdown:
  Year National average wage In 2012 dollars 2008 $41,335 $44,079 2009 $40,712 $43,569 2010 $41,674 $43,879 2011 $42,980 $43,869 2012 $44,322 $44,322   According to this data set, the average annual wage increased by 7.2 percent between 2008 and 2012. After you adjust for inflation, the average wage from 2008 was $44,079 in 2012 dollars. So from 2008-12, the inflation-adjusted wage rose by less than 1 percent. Whichever data you use, the increases are pretty modest, particularly given that they were spread out over a four-year period. Our ruling Obama said that during the past four years, ""average wages have barely budged."" Two federal data sets broadly agree: Over the most recent four-year period, the average wage has risen no more than 1.7 percent above inflation. That’s a rising wage -- but by a small amount, about a half a percentage point above inflation per year. We think that’s a reasonable definition for ""barely budged."" So we rate Obama’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DA68800>],/factchecks/2014/jan/29/barack-obama/state-union-obama-says-over-past-four-years-averag/

Dave Brat's linkage of George Soros to Abigail Spanberger gets Pants on Fire
","The spectre of George Soros - a billionaire philanthropist who supports liberal causes and is the focus of many conspiracy theorists - has entered the 7th District congressional race. Dave Brat, the Republican incumbent, is saying on conservative radio shows that Soros is behind the hefty fundraising of Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic challenger. Spanberger had raised $4.5 million through Sept. 25, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commision. That was nearly double the $2.3 million raised by Brat - or a $2.2 million difference. Brat says Soros organizations are responsible for the difference. ""She got $2.2 million from ActBlue,"" Brat said during an Oct. 21 interview on Breitbart News Sunday. ""Your audience probably knows who they are, right? But that is the George Soros resistance group. That’s not even mainstream Democrat. That’s the group that’s doing the riots in Portland, that’s promoting violence and mobs instead of jobs."" ""...Abigail Spanberger is getting $2.2 million from the Soros-linked resist movement - ActBlue,"" Brat said during an Oct. 22 interview on the John Frederick Show in Portsmouth. ""She raised $3 million in the last three months, which is unheard of, from (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi and ActBlue, which is a George Soros-backed group,"" Brat said during an Oct. 16 interview on News Radio WRVA in Richmond. ""It’s her largest bundler which raises money, and that is the group that is behind the resistance movement across the United States."" Soros has been high in the news lately. Some conservatives - including religious broadcaster Pat Roberston of Virginia Beach - have accused Soros of funding the migrant caravan from the Honduras to the United States -  a charge the billionaire says is false and for which no supporting evidence has emerged. And on Oct. 22, a pipe bomb was found in the mailbox of Soros’ home near New York City - one of at least 14 explosives that had been mailed in late October to critics of President Donald Trump. We wondered whether Brat is right in claiming Spanberger’s campaign has received $2.2 million from a Soros-controlled group called ActBlue. Let’s take a look. What is ActBlue? ActBlue is a nonprofit organization that provides a software platform for people to contribute to Democratic campaigns through personal computers and cell phones. If you donate to a Democratic candidate on his or her website, there’s a good chance that ActBlue is the conduit that sends your money to the campaign - much like PayPal is the conduit for many online purchases. Since its inception in 2005, ActBlue says it has funneled $3 billion to Democratic candidates and ""progressive"" causes. Spanberger uses ActBlue, and has received several thousand individual contributions through the platform. They totaled almost $2.2 million through Sept. 25, which was the most current FEC reporting date available when Brat made his statements. Soros is among millions of people who have made contributions through ActBlue, according to Chris Fleming, spokesman for the nonprofit. ""Soros has given through ActBlue, not to ActBlue,"" Fleming said. ""Anyone can give through ActBlue."" Fleming declined give the sum of Soros' donations to candidates through ActBlue. But he emphasized that Soros does not financially support ActBlue nor play a role in its operations. ""ActBlue is in no way related to George Soros,"" he said. Soros has not personally given money to Spanberger’s campaign or to any Democrat running for Congress during this two-year election cycle, according to FEC records. Brat’s explanation We asked Brat’s campaign for proof of the candidate’s claim that ActBlue ""is the George Soros resistance group."" Katey Price, Brat’s campaign spokesperson, sent an article from USA Today and blogs from two conservative websites: Human Events and The Daily Signal. On March 20, 2017, USA Today ran a story headlined, ""George Soros-aligned group weighs funding anti-Trump activists."" The article reported that Indivisible - a group seeking to build ""resistance"" to President Donald Trump’s agenda - was seeking support (successfully, it turns out) from the Democracy Alliance, an activist organization Soros helped found in 2005 that raises money through ActBlue. The Daily Signal - on Feb. 10, 2017 - reported that one member of Indivisible’s board of directors had previously worked for a Soros-funded group, and another member is now employed by an organization that has received money from the billionaire. That shows, according to the blog, that Soros has ""loose ties"" to Indivisible. ActBlue, the blog says ""raises money"" for Indivisible. Human Events - on July 7, 2009 - called ActBlue a mouthpiece ""for the radical agendas of the likes of Soros and labor."" As proof, it wrote that ""Soros directly donated $6,900 to ActBlue on May 11, 2008."" Fleming said this is wrong; Soros contributed the sum ""through"" ActBlue to Scott Kleeb, a Nebraska Democrat who was running for the U.S. Senate. Our ruling Brat says of Spanberger, ""She got $2.2 million for ActBlue...That is the George Soros resistance group."" Brat is implausibly positioning Soros, the focus of many conservative theorists, as the power behind Spanberger’s campaign. ActBlue is not a Soros-controlled organization. It’s a nonprofit group that provides a software platform that allows people to contribute to Democratic candidates and causes through their personal computers and cell phones. ActBlue is a conduit; it does not raise political money. As of Sept. 25, Spanberger had raised almost $2.2 million through ActBlue. The money came for from several thousand individuals, not Soros. Brat’s attempts to tie Soros to ActBlue and, therefore, Spanberger’s campaign - sometimes through third or fourth-hand links - is contrived and deceptive. We rate Brat’s statement Pants on Fire.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E8D3C80>],/factchecks/2018/nov/02/dave-brat/dave-brats-linkage-george-soros-abigail-spanberger/
"['Medicare', 'Social Security', 'North Carolina', 'Dan McCready']","
McCready is half right about Harris wanting to cut entitlements
","Seniors are among the most consistent election participants in part because they’re reliant on the largest U.S. safety net programs. So it would be politically risky for a candidate to declare his desire to cut Medicare and Social Security. And yet, Democrat Dan McCready recently accused Republican Mark Harris of admitting just that. Harris and McCready are running for North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, which stretches from Charlotte to south-central North Carolina. It’s currently held by Robert Pittenger, who Harris beat in the Republican primary. There are 116,000 people in the 9th district over 65 (the age at which most people become eligible for Medicare and full Social Security benefits) and about 100,000 more who stand to collect Social Security benefits within the next 15 years, NC political expert Michael Bitzer recently told the Charlotte Observer. In a debate on Oct. 10, things got heated between Harris and McCready after a moderator asked about how they’d continue to pay for Social Security. ""Mark Harris has said he would cut Social Security and Medicare,"" McCready said. The full debate is available on the Charlotte Observer website, and McCready made this claim around the 12-minute mark of the video. Harris said he was offended by McCready’s accusation. ""I have never said that. That is a lie that’s being perpetrated throughout the campaign and throughout the district,"" Harris said. ""I have always said we’ve got to keep Social Security solvent, we’ve got to make sure that it’s a promise made and a promise kept. And we will continue to do that."" Harris then accused McCready of wanting to raise taxes to support those programs. He continued: ""I do think we need to look at a graduated system that keeps the promise we’ve made to those that are retired and are heading toward retirement. I think when you get further back in the younger years, we need to have a graduated program that may involve options."" McCready’s argument McCready then presented a three-pronged argument for how Harris has indicated intentions to cut Medicare and Social Security. ""You supported a $1.9 trillion tax bill that takes $25 billion out of Medicare,"" McCready said to Harris. ""You’ve said you would join the Freedom Caucus, whose stated purpose is to reform Social Security as we know it,"" McCready said. ""And you said in 2014 at the Lake Norman debate that younger people would be the big loser under your plan."" Harris responded by saying, ""I’ve never expressed an overall plan except to make the point that younger people today who do not see Social Security being there when they reach it need to have some kind of options in place."" Contacted by PolitiFact, McCready’s campaign emailed video of a 2014 U.S. Senate primary debate Harris participated in, a link to an online voter guide Harris filled out for this year’s primary and two news stories — by the Washington Post and Reuters — about how Republicans want to cut entitlement programs to compensate for revenue losses from the recent tax cut. The tax cuts and Freedom Caucus The Republican tax cuts are projected to shorten the life expectancy of the programs, as PolitiFact has previously reported. The tax law trimmed a year of solvency from the primary Medicare trust fund and had a negative effect on the Social Security trust fund, PolitiFact reported in a fact check of President Donald Trump. But it’s unfair for McCready to say that, because Harris supports the tax cuts, he by extension supports further cuts to Medicare. PolitiFact couldn’t find evidence that Harris has explicitly said he wants to cut Medicare, and McCready’s camp didn’t provide any. As for the Freedom Caucus, Harris has said he’d join the conservative group. Mark Meadows, a Freedom Caucus leader, says on his website that ""Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid must be at the center of any serious proposal to return spending to sustainable levels."" However, Meadows adds, ""I do not support seriously proposing radical changes to current or soon-to-be retirees’ benefits. But if we are to continue providing these safety-nets for Americans in need we must renegotiate expectations with younger Americans. This could include increasing the retirement age for those just starting their careers, raising or eliminating the cap on payroll taxes for higher wage earners and creating incentives for personal retirement and health care savings."" What has Harris said? Now let’s look at the 2014 debate and the voter guide. In the video of the debate, Harris sounds a lot like Meadows. Harris says everyone currently over 50 should be guaranteed that they will get Social Security when they retire, but younger people shouldn’t receive that same guarantee. ""There may be a way that we’re able to scale back for others that are under 50. I’ll soon be 48, and … my generation may very well be the big loser in Social Security, but we may be able to say that at least I took care of my parents and my grandparents with what I paid into it."" He continued: ""I would rather, quite frankly, have you make the adjustment on me as a man about to turn 48, and free my children – age 25, 24, and 22 up – instead of continuing to tax them and put money into a system that they will never, ever see a dime out of it. So we’ve got to come up with a solution that will hit those generations and it’s got to be thoughtful and it’s got to be productive, but it is something that we can, we can work on and fix."" Harris’ response to iVoterGuide.com — completed for the Republican primary in this race — is similar. Harris wrote that Social Security is ""in a death spiral"" and ""needs to be overhauled."" ""However, we must honor our promises to existing retirees and those nearing retirement age keeping the current system in place for those folks,"" Harris wrote in the guide. ""In order to sustain a system that resembles Social Security, the system will need to operate in a balanced manner meaning that individuals only receive what they pay in, supplemented if desired by a government budget that should be based not on the whims of political gain but economic sensibility."" Our ruling McCready claimed Harris ""has said he would cut Social Security and Medicare."" PolitiFact couldn’t find an example of Harris describing a plan for changing Social Security and Medicare benefits for the people who get them now or stand to get them soon. On Medicare, McCready has failed to prove that Harris said he wants to cut the program at all. But on Social Security, it’s clear from his past and recent statements that his hopes for reform include changes that would limit future government payouts. Harris has used the word ""overhaul"" and said he’s open to scaling back Social Security for people under 50. However, he’s consistently said his desired reforms wouldn’t affect people who are in the program or stand to benefit from it in the next decade or so. We rate this claim Half True.

The NC Local News Lab Fund and the International Center for Journalists provide support for the project, which shares fact-checks with newsrooms statewide.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DA4DF00>],/factchecks/2018/nov/02/dan-mccready/mccready-half-right-about-harris-wanting-cut-entit/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Corrections and Updates', 'Homeland Security', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that Democrats let a cop-killing immigrant into the country
","In his final push before the midterms, President Donald Trump promoted a political video that says Democrats are responsible for letting a murderer stay in the country illegally to kill people. Trump tweeted a campaign-style video Oct. 31 about two California sheriff officers who were shot to death by an immigrant in the country illegally. The video opens with courtroom footage of a smiling Luis Bracamontes. Superimposed are the words, ""Illegal immigrant, Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!"" As Bracamontes boasts about killing the two officers and saying he would kill more if he could, new text says, ""Democrats let him into our country."" That’s quickly followed with, ""Democrats let him stay."" The video continues with footage from the caravan of Central Americans moving north in Mexico. At the end, it returns to Bracamontes’ smirking face and asks, ""Who else would Democrats let in?"" The final text says, ""President Donald Trump and Republicans are making America safe again."" Was Bracamontes in America because Democrats let him in? Not for his most recent entry. And did lax policies under Democrats let him stay? He evaded discovery, despite increasing efforts to track down criminal and immigration law offenders. Bracamontes in April was sentenced to death for the killings in California of Detective Michael Davis, Jr., and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver. Davis, of the Placer County Sheriff’s Office, responded in October 2014 to a call of a suspicious vehicle occupied by a man and a woman. Davis was shot as he got out of his car and later died in the hospital. Authorities said that before shooting Davis, Bracamontes also shot and killed Oliver, of the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department, when he was investigating a suspicious vehicle in a motel parking lot that same day. Authorities said Bracamontes shot Oliver in the forehead and then fled. Bracamontes was convicted of the killings in February 2018; he is currently in California's San Quentis State Prison. His wife, Janelle Monroy, was convicted of assisting Bracamontes and sentenced to nearly 25 years in prison, the Sacramento Bee reported. Bracamontes comes from Mexico, and his adult life followed a pattern of sneaking across the border, being deported, and sneaking back in. He was arrested for drug possession in Arizona in 1996. That was in Maricopa County, the home of then-Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Federal authorities deported him in 1997. He was arrested in Arizona again in 1998, turned over to immigration authorities, but apparently not deported. Another arrest on drug and weapons charges followed in 2001, and he was deported again. (There’s one report of another arrest in Maricopa County later in 2001.) Sometime after 2001, Bracamontes moved to Utah and began using an alias. Utah court records show that between 2003 and 2009, he had 10 driving violations. But none were serious enough to require fingerprints, according to the New York Times. In 2010, Utah entered into an agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, to assist the agency in immigration enforcement. Bracamontes’ time in America up to the killings spanned three administrations. He was arrested and deported once under Democratic President Bill Clinton, but there was a failure to deport him in 1998. He was arrested and deported again in 2001, this time under Republican President George W. Bush. He came back that same year, and was arrested again in 2001. After that, Bracamontes apparently evaded deportation through the time of his 2014 killing spree during the administration of Democratic President Barack Obama. So for eight years, from 2001 through 2008, you could argue a Republican administration failed to identify and definitively deport him. For five years, from 2009 to 2014, a Democratic administration similarly failed. (And if you want to give blame to Congress for not passing stricter laws or dedicating more resources, the two different parties shared control of Congress during the timeframe in question.) Immigration enforcement tools strengthened after 9/11 with the subsequent creation of the Department of Homeland Security, said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. The Obama administration ramped up efforts to track down felons who were in the country illegally. It expanded the Secure Communities program launched under Bush. The program fostered information sharing among federal agencies and local jails. Immigration enforcement priorities during Obama’s first term were just as broad as they are now, with people being deported for things such as traffic violations, Capps said. Immigrant advocates in 2014 famously dubbed Obama the ""deporter-in-chief."" Overall, research shows that the crime rate among immigrants, including those here illegally, is lower than in the general population, Capps said. ""The implication of this video is that there’s a large number of criminals in the unauthorized population, which isn’t true,"" Capps said. ""That’s the fundamental point of this commercial, and it’s wrong."" It’s not the first time that Trump has brought up Bracamontes in his narrative about illegal immigration. Trump invited the officers’ family members to his first address to a joint session of Congress in 2017, where he highlighted crimes by immigrants in the country illegally. Trump’s tweet included footage of migrants walking north to the United States, of some attempting to push through a fence at the Guatemala-Mexico border, and of a Fox News interview of a man in the caravan saying he wanted to ask for pardon. A woman translating in the video says the pardon he’s seeking is for attempted murder. Trump’s tweet suggests Democrats would let in murderers into the United States. Democrats are not telling caravans to come in, as Trump has falsely claimed. They’ve said people who seek asylum should be allowed to go through that legal process. But asylum applicants would need to be screened by Trump’s administration before being granted the immigration protection. Trump tweeted a video that said ""Democrats let him (cop killer Luis Bracamontes) into our country,"" and ""Democrats let him stay."" The reality is that Bracamontes’ last illegal entry was under Bush, a Republican president. The majority of his time going undetected was also on the Republican watch, though some of it was on the Democrats’ watch, too. Democratic and Republican administrations deported Bracamontes, but also failed to keep Bracamontes out of the United States. We found no evidence that he was proactively allowed to stay. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. Clarification: Federal immigration enforcement was reorganized after 9/11, and subsequently, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, received its current name. This report has been updated to remove references to the name ICE prior to 2003.",[<zip object at 0x000001A5506F83C0>],/factchecks/2018/nov/01/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-democrats-let-cop-k/
"['Crime', 'Texas', 'Ken Paxton']","
Ken Paxton airs Mostly False claim about Texas shutting down world's largest trafficking marketplace
","Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton approached Election Day with a warning about his Democratic challenger and a global crow about his own crime-fighting prowess. In a TV ad, Paxton accuses Democrat Justin Nelson of running a negative campaign — and then goes negative on Nelson’s ""liberal agenda."" The narrator closes by saying Paxton ""shut down the world’s largest human trafficking marketplace."" We were curious. Did Texas’ attorney general really do that? Jordan Berry, a Paxton campaign consultant, responded to our request for factual backup with an email stating the claim ties to the shuttering in April 2018 of Backpage.com, a classified ads website founded by Arizona-based partners in 2004 that especially flourished by posting ads focused on sex, Politico noted in a July 2018 story. Berry also pointed out another Paxton TV ad in which the narrator says Paxton ""helped"" shut down the ""criminal enterprise."" Largest trafficking marketplace? Human trafficking, Homeland Security says, ""involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act."" We didn’t spot confirmation in the materials offered by Berry that Backpage.com was the ""world’s largest human trafficking marketplace."" More limited: A 2017 U.S. Senate staff report that Berry pointed out deemed the site the ""leading online marketplace for commercial sex."" The report further says: ""Operating in 97 countries and 943 locations worldwide—and last valued at more than a half-billion dollars—Backpage is the world’s second-largest classified advertising website. Backpage is involved in 73% of all child trafficking reports that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) receives from the general public (excluding reports by Backpage itself). The National Association of Attorneys General has aptly described Backpage as a ‘hub’ of ‘human trafficking, especially the trafficking of minors.’"" For our part, we weren’t sure how to determine whether the site broke out to be the largest human trafficking marketplace. Among experts on trafficking, Laura Agustín, who has studied migrants and sex work, responded to our query with an email saying that individuals turned to ads on the Backpage site for varied reasons. ""There is no ‘marketplace,’"" Agustín wrote, ""but rather all sorts of people selling and buying sex for their own reasons, some of them miserable."" Other experts told us there’s no research to support Paxton’s largest trafficking marketplace characterization. Alexandra Levy, a University of Notre Dame adjunct professor who studies trafficking, said by email that as an empirical matter, you’d need to examine every ""human trafficking marketplace"" for comparison. Also, Levy said, ""the general idea that Backpage was a cesspool of sexual exploitation is unfounded. It was certainly a place where law enforcement found a lot of victims -- but that might just be because it was a particularly visible venue,"" Levy wrote. Peter M. Zollman of Advanced Interactive Media Group, consultants in classified advertising and interactive media, said by phone that while there were instances of trafficking linked to ads placed on the Backpage site, there’s no proof that the site was a major conduit for trafficking. Zollman speculated that if any website leads the world in human trafficking, it’s one that’s on the dark web, which isn’t visible to search engines. Calling Backpage.com the world’s largest trafficking marketplace, Zollman said, is an ""outright fabrication."" Checking Paxton’s role So, did Paxton shut down Backpage.com? His agency had a hand in the shutdown, we confirmed, but the federal government did the deed. Berry noted that before the site and company were shut down, Paxton in 2016 established a unit in the attorney general’s office to combat human trafficking. Next, in October 2016, Paxton announced that in tandem with California authorities, Texas had arrested Backpage’s CEO, Carl Ferrer. The Texas attorney general’s office said in a press release about Ferrer’s arrest that a joint investigation by the offices of the Texas and California attorneys general ""uncovered evidence that adult and child sex trafficking victims were forced into prostitution through escort ads that appeared repeatedly on Backpage."" The release also said: ""Nearly three dozen members of the Texas Attorney General’s Law Enforcement Unit participated in Ferrer’s arrest and the execution of a search warrant on the Dallas headquarters of Backpage, which is considered the largest advertiser of adult escort services in the United States."" An April 2018 seizure and shutdown We also clicked online to the defunct Backpage site, which we found mostly covered up by a message, dated April 6, 2018, indicating that Texas played a supporting role in shutting down the site and company. The message says that backpage.com ""and affiliated websites have been seized as part of an enforcement action by the"" FBI, U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Internal Revenue Service. The Texas AG’s office was mentioned in the message’s next section stating that agencies participating in and supporting the enforcement action ""include the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, the office of the California Attorney General and the office of the Texas Attorney General."" Our click on the message itself bounced us to an April 9, 2018 DOJ press release headlined, ""Justice Department Leads Effort to Seize Backpage.Com, the Internet’s Leading Forum for Prostitution Ads, and Obtains 93-Count Federal Indictment."" That release quotes Jeff Sessions, the U.S. attorney general, saying that on April 6, 2018, the Justice Department seized Backpage, which had been the ""dominant marketplace for illicit commercial sex, a place where sex traffickers frequently advertised children and adults."" Now, Sessions said, ""it can no longer be used by criminals to promote and facilitate human trafficking."" The release closes: ""The effort to seize Backpage was led by the Justice Department’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona, with significant support from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, the office of the California Attorney General, and the office of the Texas Attorney General."" Levy, the Notre Dame expert, told us separately: ""Paxton did not shut down Backpage -- the federal government did."" Levy added that when Backpage.com was closed, the relevant federal law, section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, didn’t generally give state attorneys general ""the power to prosecute platforms (like Backpage) for content posted by third parties,"" though Congress subsequently amended the law, Levy wrote. Summing up, Levy said the Texas AG ""could not by any stretch be credibly considered a primary enforcer"" in the Backpage.com shutdown. What role, Texas? If Texas didn’t shut down Backpage by itself, we asked, what role did it play? Paxton, we confirmed, was focused on the company years before the shutdown. In an October 2016 press release pointed out to us by Kayleigh Lovvorn, a spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general’s office, Paxton announced that Ferrer had been taken into custody on a California arrest warrant after he arrived in Houston on a flight from abroad. ""A lengthy joint investigation"" by the Texas and California attorney general offices ""uncovered evidence that adult and child sex trafficking victims were forced into prostitution,"" the release said, ""through escort ads"" on Backpage.com. The release said nearly 36 AG employees participated in Ferrer’s arrest and in executing a search warrant on the Dallas headquarters of Backpage, ""which is considered the largest advertiser of adult escort services in the United States,"" the release said. At the time, an Associated Press news story said Ferrer had agreed to be extradited from Texas to California to face sex-trafficking and money-laundering charges. The story, citing a sworn statement filed by the Texas AG’s office for a search warrant, also said that the online ad portal received more than 90 percent of its revenue from the adult escort ad portion of its classified advertising business. The story said Ferrer ""was told directly by law enforcement officials about prostitution on the site and,"" according to the Texas affidavit, is ""regularly copied on the hundreds of law enforcement subpoenas and requests that Backpage.com receives each year related to prostitution and sex trafficking of both adults and minors on the website,"" the story said.  California authorities said that state's three-year investigation found many of the ads involve victims of sex trafficking including children younger than 18, the story said. State plea bargain From Berry, we fielded what he described as filings demonstrating that action spearheaded in state court by the Texas attorney general’s office led to Ferrer agreeing to shut down Backpage. The documents were filed April 9, 2018 in a Nueces County state district court--three days after authorities shut down Backpage though the same day Sessions announced that shutdown. They include a ""Plea Bargain Agreement"" in which Ferrer agreed to immediately take steps to permanently shut down Backpage.com globally. Ferrer also pleaded guilty to money laundering and, granted ""use immunity,"" agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in Texas and California. According to another document filed with the court, Ferrer pleaded guilty to trafficking and engaging in organized criminal activity in what the document described as actions related to one minor compelled to do sex work in connection with Backpage.com. We asked Levy to review the provided documents. Do they demonstrate Paxton’s agency steered the multi-government effort to close Backpage? Levy said not, writing: ""The feds had already seized Backpage by the time those pleas were signed."" Our ruling Paxton says he ""shut down the world’s largest human trafficking marketplace."" We see an element of truth to this claim: The Texas attorney general’s office helped shut down the Backpage website, which is what another Paxton ad says. However, the federal government led the shutdown and officials in other states pitched in. Significantly too, we otherwise landed no confirmation that the Backpage site, which profited from ads about sex, also was the world’s largest trafficking marketplace--a classification that experts found dubious and unverifiable. All told, we rate this statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Donald Trump falsely says Democrats invite migrant caravans
","President Donald Trump is rallying support for Republican candidates in the midterm elections with sweeping rhetoric about Democrats looking out for waves of ""illegal aliens"" over the interests of Americans. ""The Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan of illegal aliens into our country,"" Trump said Oct. 26 at a campaign rally in Charlotte, N.C. ""And they want to sign them up for free health care, free welfare, free education, and for the right to vote."" A caravan of Central American migrants is in southern Mexico trekking north to the Mexico-U.S. border. Some are fleeing gangs in Central America and plan to request asylum in the United States. Others say they are migrating due to poverty in their home countries. (Here’s what we know about the caravan, and here’s a round-up of misinformation about it.) The White House did not provide an on-the-record response to back Trump’s claim. Democrats have said immigrants should be allowed the legal right to ask for asylum, but that’s not the same as inviting caravans to come to the United States. They also haven’t said they want to ""sign them up"" for benefits or to vote illegally, or to go beyond existing laws. Democrats have largely remained silent about the caravan, focusing instead on Republicans and health care as the Nov. 6 Election Day nears. Some Democrats have said that immigrants seeking asylum should be allowed to go through that legal process, but that’s not necessarily extending an invitation. CNN’s Jake Tapper in an Oct. 23 interview asked Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, to address the Democratic Party’s message about the caravan and whether they’d be allowed to ""come in and apply for refugee status."" ""We are a nation of laws, and the laws that are on the books deal with issues of refugee and asylum status, and those are the laws that have always applied,"" Perez said. ""It's a humanitarian issue of significance, and our laws require that people be treated with dignity and given that process."" Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., made a similar statement. ""Our strength has always been that we are a tolerant country, that we are welcoming in particular those who have fled harm,"" Harris said Oct. 22 in Iowa, according to CNN. ""The idea that we're vilifying any one group, and the fear-mongering — that's not in the best interest of our country."" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in an Oct. 20 joint statement said Trump was ""desperate to change the subject from health care to immigration because he knows that health care is the number one issue Americans care about,"" adding that Republicans ""are making a mess of our health care system."" Pelosi reiterated that message in another statement: ""Despite Republicans’ fear-mongering, this group of families may not even make it to the U.S. border, and those migrating for economic reasons will not qualify for asylum."" Caravan members are also not ""illegal aliens,"" said Stephen Legomsky, a professor emeritus at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Obama administration. ""Of course the U.S. isn’t obligated to grant asylum to everyone who applies,"" said Legomsky, ""but upon reaching the border they have a legal right, explicitly granted by Congress, to apply for it."" Democrats aren’t saying they want to sign up caravan members for perks upon arrival, much less the right to vote without being U.S. citizens. PolitiFact has repeatedly debunked Trump’s claims of mass voter fraud. Even if some caravan members were granted asylum and became citizens, it would take several years before they are able to vote for candidates for federal office. (A small number of jurisdictions allow noncitizens to vote in local races.) ""The only caravan members who might one day become eligible to vote would be those who are found to meet all the legal requirements for asylum, later acquire green cards, and then eventually become naturalized citizens,"" Legomsky said. A person must be a green card holder for at least five years and meet certain other requirement before applying for U.S. citizenship. If granted asylum, immigrants do become eligible for Medicaid and other forms of government assistance, Legomsky said. Federal law bars immigrants in the country illegally from most public assistance programs. However, they can receive free school lunches, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and emergency medical care. ""Concern over illegal immigrants placing significant demands on public service is well founded,"" said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors low immigration levels. ""But it is not some moral defect on their part, rather it reflects the very low education levels of this population and resulting low income and them needing services."" A 1982 U.S. Supreme Court case also said that immigrants, regardless of immigration status, are allowed free elementary and secondary education. ""But immigrant children can’t access that right if they are detained waiting for their asylum hearings, except in a few family detention centers,"" said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School. If caravan members get into the United States and receive emergency medical care, go to public school and get free school lunch, it wouldn’t necessarily be because Democrats ""sign them up,"" it would be because it’s permitted under law. If they eventually obtain U.S. citizenship, they’d be allowed to vote. Trump said, ""The Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan of illegal aliens into our country. And they want to sign them up for free health care, free welfare, free education, and for the right to vote."" A top Democrat said immigrants should be allowed go through the asylum application process, which is available under law. But it’s a stretch for Trump to say that’s an invitation for caravans to come to the United States. Immigrants granted asylum become eligible for Medicaid and other forms of government assistance. Immigrants in the country illegally can receive emergency medical care and limited access to programs, such as free school lunch and free public education. That wouldn’t be because Democrats ""want to sign them up,"" but because it’s allowed by law. Trump’s claim also falsely implies Democrats want to rush caravan members in to vote in the midterm elections. Trump’s claim is inaccurate and a distortion of the facts. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E9F4CC0>],/factchecks/2018/nov/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-says-democrats-invite-migrant/

2015 letter doesn't reveal Soros 'plot' to use migration to take down borders
","A viral blog post claims that billionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist George Soros has been ""plotting since 2015 to use migrant caravan blitzkriegs to achieve the goal of ‘taking down national borders.' "" The Oct. 21 article, posted to NewsPunch.com, shows a photo of Soros photoshopped onto a crowd of people. The article’s headline claims, ""Soros Letter Reveals Plot to ‘Take Down Borders’ with Migrant Caravan Invasions,"" in reference to the nearly 7,000 people making their way to the United States-Mexican border that originated in Honduras two weeks ago. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post received over 900 interactions and been shared over 280 times, CrowdTangle data show. The blog post’s author is listed as ""Thomas Williams,"" who has also authored recent posts like, ""Doctor Blows Whistle on ‘Disastrous’ Flu Shot – ‘It’s Designed to Spread Cancer,’"" published Oct. 20.

The article claims that, ""As the Left continues to lose the battle for America’s soul, its greatest champions are going all-out in an attempt to turn the tide any way they can – even if it means destroying the country."" The author cites a November 2015 Breitbart London article as proof of Soros’ goal of ""wiping out all national borders."" NewsPunch claims that Soros said this ""following an accusation made last week"" by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. NewsPunch is taking Soros’ statement from 2015 out of context. In October 2015, Orban accused Soros of being part of a group of ""activists"" that ""weakens nation states."" ""These activists who support immigrants inadvertently become part of this international human-smuggling network,"" Bloomberg Business reported Orban saying at the time. In response, Soros emailed a statement to Bloomberg Business, defending his position. Orban’s plan, Soros wrote at the time, ""treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle. Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle."" In his statement, Soros doesn’t say his goal is ""wiping out all national borders,"" like NewsPunch claims. Soros, who was born in Hungary to a Jewish family and lived through the Nazi invasion, does give financial support to organizations that provide legal assistance to immigrants seeking asylum. As a student at the London School of Economics in 1947, Soros studied the work and philosophy of Karl Popper, author of ""The Open Society and its Enemies."" As Soros wrote in a lecture he delivered at the Central European University in 2009 and later published as part of a book, he was attracted to the notion that the truth is not the domain of any one ideology: ""Ideologies that claim to be in possession of the ultimate truth are making a false claim; therefore, they can be imposed on society only by compulsion. All such ideologies lead to repression. Popper proposed a more attractive form of social organization: an open society in which people are free to hold divergent opinions and the rule of law allows people with different views and interests to live together in peace. Having lived through both German and Russian occupation here in Hungary, I found the idea of an open society immensely attractive."" That is not the same thing as supporting the destruction of national borders. The NewsPunch article is nearly identical to a Nov. 6, 2015, Natural News article titled, ""George Soros letter reveals globalist plan to destroy the First World by eliminating national borders with global migrant blitzkreig invasions."" However, included in the NewsPunch article is a screenshot from a video that has gone viral after being tweeted by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., on Oct. 17. 2018.  The video depicts cash being handed out to people, and NewsPunch included a screenshot of it with the caption ""A man pays members of the migrant caravan in cash."" Gaetz claimed the footage was from Honduras and mentions Soros in his tweet, writing ""Time to investigate the source!"" As PolitiFact has reported, the footage is from Chiquimula, Guatemala, not Honduras, and shot outside a store that sells auto parts. Bloggers have falsely claimed that the migration was funded by Democrats. Open Society Foundations, an international grantmaking network founded by Soros in 1979, denied Gaetz’s claim that Soros or his philanthropies are funding the migration. ""Neither Mr. Soros nor Open Society are funding this effort. We do support the historic U.S. commitment to welcoming people fleeing oppression and violence in their homelands,"" Open Society Foundations wrote in an Oct. 18 tweet. NewsPunch claimed that Soros’ 2015 statement to Bloomberg Business in response to Orban’s accusations, ""Reveals Plot to ‘Take Down Borders’ with Migrant Caravan Invasions."" The blog post is conflating a three-year-old statement made by Soros with the current migration to the United States-Mexico border, attempting to draw a connection between the two that isn’t there.

Is Hispanic household income at a record high, as Donald Trump says?
","At a rally in Wheeling, W.Va, on Sept. 29, President Donald Trump touted economic advancement by Hispanic Americans. ""Household income among Hispanic Americans has just set a new record high,"" Trump told the crowd. Is that correct? We took a closer look. Every year, the U.S. Census Bureau releases its annual Income and Poverty Report. The 2017 statistics, released in September 2018, contained the following chart showing median household income by race from 1967 to 2017. The chart shows that the 2017 median household income for Hispanic-Americans of any race -- $50,486 when adjusted for inflation -- was higher than it was for any previous year.    Between 2010 and 2017, inflation-adjusted incomes for Hispanic households rose by about one-third. The rise in Hispanic income wasn’t unusual -- as the chart indicates, incomes have risen consistently for every racial and ethnic group since the recovery from the Great Recession began, with the exception of a recent downturn for Asian-Americans.. The timing of the income rise for Hispanic households means that this is not an accomplishment only for the Trump administration. Hispanic incomes began rising in 2011 and continued to increase for most of President Barack Obama’s administration. They have continued that rise under Trump. Trump said that ""household income among Hispanic Americans has just set a new record high."" Census Bureau data confirms a new record high for inflation-adjusted, Hispanic household income in 2017, the most recent year for which data is available. This continues a rise that began under Obama, but Trump did not specifically claim credit, so we rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54F36F1C0>],/factchecks/2018/nov/01/donald-trump/hispanic-household-income-record-high-donald-trump/

Did Donald Trump call the Republican health care plan 'mean'?
","As the midterm elections draw closer, Democrats are increasingly focusing their messages on affordable health care. Heidi Heitkamp, the incumbent Senator in North Dakota, has made her Republican opponent’s voting record on this issue one of her main talking-points. In a Bismarck Tribune op-ed published this week, Heitkamp argued that her opponent, U. S. Rep. Kevin Cramer, ""looks at health care through a strictly political lens."" Heitkamp attacked Cramer for voting for several bills to repeal and replace Obamacare, and wrote that ""President Donald Trump even referred to one of Cramer’s health care repeal bills as 'mean' because the bill gutted protections for North Dakotans with preexisting conditions."" Although Trump praised the American Health Care Act (AHCA), when it was passed in the House in May 2017, he later said that the Republican bill was ""mean."" The bill didn’t make it out of Congress. What Trump said about Trumpcare The American Health Care Act was passed by House Republicans on May 4, 2017, by a narrow majority of 217 to 213.  We have analysed the AHCA, and found that it had the potential to allow insurers to set premiums based on the health status of an individual, making costs higher for consumers who are sicker. When the bill was passed in the House, Trump expressed his support of the Republican plan. ""This is a great plan,"" Trump said in a White House announcement with House Republicans. ""I actually think it will get better. And this is, make no mistake, this is a repeal and replace of Obamacare."" However, in June 2017, the Associated Press reported that Trump told 15 Republican senators that the House bill was ""mean, mean, mean,"" and that they needed to make the Senate version of the bill ""more generous."" On June 25, in an interview on ""Fox and Friends"", Trump was asked about about a Facebook post by former President Barack Obama, who criticised the GOP plan and said that the amendment made to the Senate bills would not change ""the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation."" Fox News’ Pete Hegseth told Trump that it was ""unprecedented for a former president to come out the way President Obama has"" and asked, ""What do you say to the former president?"" Trump responded by saying that Obama ""actually used my term, mean. That was my term, because I want to see -- and I speak from the heart, that’s what I want to see -- I want to see a bill with heart."" Shortly afterward, Trump said again that he was pleased with his party’s health care plan: ""Honestly, nobody can be totally happy, even without the votes, forget about votes, this has nothing to do with votes. This has to do with picking a plan that everybody is going to like. I'd like to say love, but like. But we have a very good plan, we have a few people that are, I think you could say modestly, they're not standing on the rooftops and screaming. They want to get some points. I think they'll get some points."" Our ruling Heitkamp said that a House bill to repeal Obamacare supported by Kevin Cramer was referred to as ""mean"" by President Donald Trump. Trump did say that the American Health Care Act, which was passed in the House on May 2017 and which Cramer voted for, was ""mean."" It’s worth pointing out that Trump also said the the Republican health plan was a ""great plan."" Trump didn't specifically say it was mean because of how it handled pre-existing conditions, but that was certainly one of the controversial aspects of the bill. The statement is accurate but needs additional information.

Is West Virginia poverty 5% higher than U.S. as a whole?
","Kendra Fershee, a Democrat who is challenging U.S. Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., took aim at the poverty rate in a Sept. 19 Facebook post. ""Poverty in WV is more than 5% higher than the national average,"" Fershee wrote in the post. ""The poor are getting (much) poorer and if you look at what my opponent is posting (stories about how great the economy is, using national statistics) he doesn’t even seem to know that there’s a problem in WV."" She added, ""Are you ok with our state diving deeper into despair while our elected officials: vote for policy that drives wages lower, push to strip healthcare from poor people and people with pre-existing conditions, and then pat themselves on the back for a job well done? I’m not. This is unacceptable. But WE can fix it on Nov. 6.""   We wondered whether poverty in West Virginia is more than 5 percent higher than the national average. So we took a closer look. The post links to a Sept. 18 article in the Parkersburg News and Sentinel headlined, ""Poverty increases in W.Va."" According to the article, ""About 336,000 West Virginians lived in poverty in 2017, 5.7 percent higher than the national average. West Virginia was among the top four states with poverty rates of 18 percent – Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and West Virginia."" To confirm the newspaper’s data, we turned to the original figures from the U.S. Census Bureau. The numbers check out: The U.S poverty rate was 13.4 percent, but the West Virginia poverty rate was 19.1. The difference: 5.7 percentage points. To be precise, however, Fershee should have said that the poverty rate in West Virginia is more than 5 percentage points higher than the United States as a whole -- not 5 percent higher. If it were 5 percent higher, the poverty rate in West Virginia would be about 14.1 percent, not 19.1 percent. So the poverty rate in West Virginia is actually higher than Fershee’s literal words suggested. In an interview, Fershee said that it’s important to note that ""the rest of the country is doing better, and West Virginia’s poverty rate has actually worsened,"" said Fershee. The historical data bears that out. Here’s a chart of the U.S. and West Virginia poverty rates going back to 2005.   In 2012, the gap between the U.S. and West Virginia poverty rates was 1.9 percentage points. Five years later, the gap was 5.7 points. Fershee said, ""Poverty in WV is more than 5% higher than the national average."" Only a slip-up in her mathematical terminology keeps this from being fully accurate. The poverty rate in West Virginia was 5.7 percentage points higher than the national rate, not more than 5 percent higher.

Hawley claim stretches McCaskill record on gun background checks
","Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley told Missouri residents on live television that U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill voted against the inclusion of mental health records in gun background checks. ""The (national background check system) doesn’t work that well because there’s a giant loophole right in the middle of it. It doesn’t include mental health records,"" Hawley said during the second Senate debate. ""Congress could have done this, they’ve had the chance to do it, but they haven’t."" ""Sen. McCaskill voted against including health records in the background check system. I think that was wrong,"" Hawley said. ""I know it was along the party line, but I think that was wrong."" We’ve fact-checked other politicians’ statements on gun control legislation in the past, including some specifically related to firearm access for people with a history of mental illness. McCaskill has received an ""F"" rating from the National Rifle Association and taken $156,949 from gun control political action committees this election cycle, according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. McCaskill maintained during the debate that she supports and has voted for universal background checks. So has she or hasn’t she voted against including mental health records as part of the gun-purchasing background check process? Hawley’s evidence for McCaskill’s disapproval of including mental health records in the background check system was her vote against a 2016 amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2016. Sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the proposal was one of four that came in the wake of a mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub, where a gunman killed 49 people. Grassley’s 2016 amendment would have incentivized states to submit relevant mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. ""The Democrats put the kibosh on a bill that, on its face, would have strengthened (to some degree) populating NICS database with names of persons ineligible to purchase guns on account of a mental illness disqualifier,"" said Jacob James, a professor of constitutional law and director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University, in an email. James said that Grassley’s amendment likely didn’t pass muster with Democrats like McCaskill ""because they favored a stronger gun control bill, which had no chance of passage."" Indeed, some of the leading opponents of the amendment said at the time that it did not go far enough in keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and suspected terrorists. ""It was dangerous and reckless,"" said Jonas Oransky, legal director for Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control  organization that rallied against the amendment. Oransky called it a decoy to meaningful gun control legislation that would have ""invalidated hundreds of thousands of existing mental health records already in the background check system."" Representatives from gun rights advocacy groups, including the National Rifle Association, which backed Grassley’s amendment, did not immediately respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. The 2016 vote was similar to a failed 2013 measure co-sponsored by Grassley and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. McCaskill voted against that one, too. McCaskill voted in favor of an amendment to the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., sponsored the piece, which would have expanded background checks to gun shows and internet sales, and allotted grants ""to improve the automation and transmittal of mental health records and criminal history dispositions."" It also would have created a commission of experts charged with studying mass violence, including the role of mental health issues. The Manchin-Toomey amendment died in a Senate filibuster. In 2016, as McCaskill voted no on the Grassley amendment, she voted yes on another amendment co-sponsored by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., known as the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2016. Its purpose was to ensure that ""all individuals who should be prohibited from buying a firearm are listed in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and require a background check for every firearm sale."" Though it, too, failed to pass, the amendment also included guidelines on how to define and include relevant mental health records in the national background check system. ""Sen. McCaskill has consistently and repeatedly supported legislation to improve the federal background check system,"" said Max Samis, press secretary for gun control Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence.* Samis along with McCaskill’s campaign noted McCaskill’s co-sponsorship of a bill called the Fix NICS ACT of 2017, which aims to incentivize states to submit relevant records to the nationwide criminal background check system. After a gunman murdered 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida, last February, McCaskill joined other members of Congress in saying that proposal was a start, she saw a need for gun legislation that went further. ""It’s an important little step, but surely we can do more than the teeniest, tiniest steps right now,"" McCaskill told Politico earlier this year. Hawley said McCaskill ""voted against including (mental) health records in the background check system."" Hawley is isolating one vote from a GOP proposal while ignoring McCaskill’s full record in the Senate. McCaskill clearly has supported efforts to tighten restrictions for who can purchase a firearm, including measures that clearly addressed the inclusion of mental health records in the gun background check system and more aggressive overall provisions for regulating gun sales.

Did CAIR, Muslim Brotherhood back a Democratic candidate?
","The U.S. House race in California’s 50th district has gotten nasty. Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter represents a solidly Republican district, but he was indicted in August for misusing campaign funds. This has given a boost to his previously longshot Democratic challenger, Ammar Campa-Najjar, who is of Palestinian and Mexican ancestry. A recent poll by the independent firm SurveyUSA had Hunter with only a three-point lead. Hunter has attracted national attention — and criticism — for rhetoric that seeks to paint Campa-Najjar as someone who has ties to Islamist terrorists. ""Ammar Campa-Najjar is working to infiltrate Congress,"" says one ad by Hunter’s campaign. ""He’s used three different names to hide his family’s ties to terrorism. His grandfather masterminded the Munich Olympic massacre. His father said they deserved to die."" The ad then plays video aired by the conservative One America News Network: ""A Palestinian-Mexican American doesn’t get his support from the people of San Diego.’ ‘He is being supported by CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood.’ ‘This is a well-orchestrated plan.’"" The ad closes, ""Ammar Campa-Najjar: A risk we can’t ignore.""   The Washington Post Fact Checker looked at various elements of this ad as well as separate remarks delivered by Hunter and gave them a collective Four Pinocchios, the worst possible rating. (Campa-Najjar, for instance, never knew his grandfather, his father’s comment was not that straightforward, and he was raised by his mother’s Mexican-American family.) Here, we’ll zero in on one particular claim in the advertisement — that Campa-Najjar ""is being supported by CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood."" CAIR refers to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Washington-based group whose mission is to ""enhance understanding of Islam, protect civil rights, promote justice, and empower American Muslims. The assertion about the support for Campa-Najjar’s campaign is not accurate. Despite Hunter’s continued invocation of radical Islam in the campaign, Campa-Najjar is actually a Christian of long standing. In a statement provided by Campa-Najjar’s campaign, Mike Meeks, pastor emeritus of EastLake Church, said, ""I have known Ammar since he was 16, when he became part of our youth ministry. Before he left for college, he grew up serving our janitorial staff, worship team, and youth ministry, where he even gave Sunday Youth group sermons. When he served in federal government, we talked regularly about life and the faith challenges of following Jesus in today’s world. Through it all, Ammar remains committed to growing in his faith, following Jesus and serving his community."" Campa-Najjar’s campaign said that the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist political organization in Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries, would deem him an apostate due to his Christianity. Furthermore, neither the Muslim Brotherhood nor CAIR are legally able to support a candidate. Over the years, the United States’ relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood has ranged from uneasy tolerance to outright opposition. But whatever the U.S. policy has been, the Muslim Brotherhood is a foreign organization, so as such, the group and its leaders are prohibited by federal law from making ""any contribution, expenditure or donation in any U.S. election."" As for CAIR, it is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Internal Revenue Service regulations say that 501(c)(3) groups are ""precluded from engaging in any political campaign activities."" Laws aside, there is no evidence that either group has given money to Campa-Najjar. The most one could say is that a few CAIR volunteers have done so in their personal capacity. The San Diego Union-Tribune cross-referenced records of donations made to Campa-Najjar with lists of CAIR board members and found that the candidate received 18 donations from seven people totaling $17,300. Through Oct. 31, Campa-Najjar had raised $3,168,975, meaning that the donations from CAIR board members accounted for about one half of 1 percent of his donations this cycle. ""None of the seven donors held paid positions with CAIR, according to public tax reports,"" the newspaper reported. ""Donors listed their primary employers and occupations — their day jobs — to identify themselves to the campaign as required by the FEC."" For instance, the Union-Tribune reached David Chami, an attorney who lives in Arizona and serves on the board of a local CAIR chapter. Chami told the newspaper ""that he is not paid by CAIR and that his contribution was independent and based solely on Campa-Najjar’s position on consumer advocacy laws."" He added, ""My decision to help a particular candidate is based on their political positions and issues they support. It has nothing to do with religion and if it did, I’m Muslim and he is a Christian."" Robert S. McCaw, the director of government affairs for CAIR, told PolitiFact, ""We can confirm that CAIR or its chapters did not donate to or endorse Campa-Najjar. What staff or board members do on their own time is their own business.""’ Hunter’s office did not respond to an inquiry. Hunter said, ""Ammar Campa-Najjar is working to infiltrate Congress"" and ""is being supported by CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood."" Neither group can do so under federal law, and there is no evidence that they have broken the law to donate to his campaign. Campa-Najjar has received more than a dozen personal donations from people who happen to be CAIR volunteers. We could find no connection to the Muslim Brotherhood. This is an unsubstantiated accusation that rests on fear-mongering. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001A5508AB680>],/factchecks/2018/nov/01/duncan-hunter-2/did-cair-muslim-brotherhood-back-democratic-candid/

However, she did know about the allegations when she announced her decision, a fact she denied during an Oct. 25, 2018, debate against Republican challenger and Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley. ""I made my decision on Kavanaugh before the allegations surfaced, and it was all about Kavanaugh's alliance and allegiance to dark money and unlimited political contributions,"" McCaskill said during the debate.

As of that date, McCaskill had yet to announce how she would vote on the nominee. The next day, Sept. 17, 2018, statement said that she was ""deeply troubled by these allegations"" and that they should be investigated by the Senate Judiciary Committee. In it, she did not disclose how she planned to vote. McCaskill’s statement about her vote came a few days later, on Sept. 19, 2018. In that statement, she acknowledged the allegations against Kavanaugh but said that she did not base her decision on them. ""(W)hile the recent allegations against him are troubling and deserve a thorough and fair examination by the Senate Judiciary Committee, my decision is not based on those allegations but rather on his positions on several key issues, most importantly the avalanche of dark, anonymous money that is crushing our democracy,"" the statement read. McCaskill repeated a version of the claim in an Oct. 30 interview with CNN, saying she ""made her decision before the allegations had even really surfaced, way before the ugly confirmation process."" McCaskill’s decision to vote ""no"" did precede other allegations of sexual misconduct. The story about a second woman, Deborah Ramirez, broke in the New Yorker on Sept. 23, 2018. A third accuser, Julie Swetnick, came forward on Sept. 26. Ford and Kavanaugh testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 27, 2018, a little more than a week after McCaskill made her official statement. McCaskill said that she made her decision to vote against Kavanaugh before allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced. McCaskill did say in her statement at the time that her ""no"" vote was based on Kavanaugh's position on several issues, including dark money.

Protections on pre-existing conditions have not existed in North Dakota since 1970s

Heitkamp pressed Cramer to explain why he had voted multiple times to repeal the Affordable Care Act in the House of Representatives. Cramer said the Republican alternatives he voted for ""do guarantee, emphatically, without any ambiguity whatsoever, people with pre-existing conditions."" While protections for pre-existing conditions were baked into the multiple ACA replacements, we’ve found the language is not as air tight as under Obamacare.

You took away the protections on pre-existing conditions,"" Heitkamp said. ""No, because protections on pre-existing conditions have been there since the 1970s, and North Dakota, under Gov. Ed Schafer, had a plan to cover people in North Dakota,"" Cramer said. ""I trust the governors of North Dakota and our legislature way more than I trust (the federal government)."" Have pre-existing conditions been protected in North Dakota for decades? No. ""To suggest there was a complete protection of pre-existing conditions under state or federal law is just not accurate,"" said Kevin Lucia, project director at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute. Cramer’s campaign referred us to the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974. That regulated various aspects of most employer-provided group health plans. It wasn't until the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was passed in 1996, however, that federal law limited the ability of such plans to exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions, according to Amy Monahan, a law professor at the University of Minnesota. Cramer did clarify, in the debate and through his campaign, that federal law protected people on group plans, which the majority of people in North Dakota have. ""That takes us down to a very small number,"" Cramer said. But coverage for people in group plans isn’t at stake here; it’s coverage for individuals outside of group plans. That’s about 8 percent of the population in North Dakota. It’s a small number, as Cramer said, but not insignificant. Prior to the ACA, private insurers in the individual market in North Dakota could turn people down because of a pre-existing condition, or exclude coverage for their pre-existing condition. HIPAA provided some protection for people who recently lost job-based coverage to transition into individual coverage, and each state had to figure out how to implement it. North Dakota did that through the Comprehensive Health Association of North Dakota, which went into effect in 1982, effectively predating the law. ""Even though technically these plans provided a safety net for people with pre-existing conditions, it was a weak safety net,"" said Allison Hoffman, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. ""For most people, it did not work well because coverage was expensive and limited."" Earl Pomeroy, former Insurance Commissioner for North Dakota from 1985 to 1992, said he was unaware of any other state programs that beefed up coverage for pre-existing conditions. The high-risk pool is still in place today, but its protections are limited in comparison to the ACA. Most other states eliminated their own pools after the ACA became law. First, people who are not HIPAA-eligible have to wait six months before coverage begins for their pre-existing conditions, or nine months if they are pregnant. For a cancer patient, that can be six months too many. HIPAA eligibility is conferred by 18 months of qualifying previous coverage and less than a 63-day gap in coverage. Second, the policies cap out at $1 million. ""An individual with a serious pre-existing condition could hit that cap pretty quickly and then have no source of coverage after that,"" said Wendy Netter Epstein, a law professor at DePaul University. Third, premiums can be up to 35 percent more expensive than standard rates. In the individual market in the ACA, there are no lifetime caps and the standard rate is the rate, according to Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. While rates have been on the rise, the ACA offers sliding scale subsidies for people earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. 87 percent of marketplace enrollees received subsidies in North Dakota this year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Cramer said, ""Protections on pre-existing conditions have been there since the 1970s."" Coverage of pre-existing conditions in group plans has been mandated by law since 1994, not the 1970s. But private insurers in North Dakota could turn down people in the individual market because of a pre-existing condition prior to the ACA. A 1982 state law provided an alternative, but it was not nearly as strong a guarantee of protection for pre-existing conditions as those provided by the ACA. We rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E9FA1C0>],/factchecks/2018/nov/01/kevin-cramer/no-protections-pre-existing-conditions-have-not-ex/

Viral photo does not show pipe bomb suspect Cesar Sayoc with a 'Democrat Donor'
","A viral photo depicting Cesar Sayoc, a supporter of President Donald Trump who was charged Monday with five federal crimes in connection with 14 explosive packages sent to Democrats and CNN, claims he’s pictured with a ""Democrat Donor."" The photo shows Sayoc smiling next to a man, and has been shared thousands of times by users on Twitter, Facebook and 4Chan. In an Oct. 27 Facebook post that was shared over 44,000 times, a user named Alan Reynolds posted the photo and wrote: ""PIPE BOMBER SUSPECT pictured last year with Izzy Hernandez. Sayok does not appear destitute. In addition, why would a Trump enthusiast attend a banquet and have a photo OP with a Democrat Donor/Supporter? Facebook keeps trying to take down this photo,,,pls share this ASAP!"" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Reynolds’ did not immediately reply to a message asking for evidence to justify his claim. Conservative pundit Ann Coulter even shared the image on Oct. 28, retweeting a tweet that included it, and wrote, ""Why do Facebook & Twitter immediately delete accounts of nuts at all? So we can rely on the media to tell us what they've posted? Why not let everyone see?"" Facebook and Twitter removed Sayoc’s social media accounts Friday, The New York Times reported. While the image appears to show Sayoc, it’s unclear who the man smiling next to him in the photo is. Users on message boards like 4Chan have pointed out that it’s possibly a North Carolina soccer coach named Israel Hernandez. Indeed, it appears Sayoc did have a personal relationship with a man named Israel ""Izzy"" Hernandez: They were soccer buddies. The New York Times reported that Sayoc attended Brevard College in North Carolina, ""for a year beginning in the fall of 1980 and played on the soccer team but did not graduate, according to a spokeswoman."" In a digital archive of Brevard College’s 1981 yearbook, ""The Pertelote,"" a student named Cesar Sayoc appears on pages 152 and 155, in a team photo and playing soccer. The caption of one photo reads, ""Cesar Sayoc extends after a shot to the goal."" A student named Cesar Sayoc also appears in Brevard College’s 1982 yearbook on pages 77 and 136, again in photos of the school’s soccer team. Following Sayoc’s arrest, former Brevard College soccer coach Don Scarborough on Oct. 26 spoke to WRAL-TV  NBC affiliate in Raleigh, North Carolina, about his experience coaching Sayoc. In it, Scarborough mentions that North Carolina Soccer Hall of Famer Israel ""Izzy"" Hernandez was on the same team as Sayoc and that the two were ""friends."" ""Cesar was just one of the guys. I mean looking back on it, I think that soccer team that he was on for two years was the best family and the only family that maybe he had during his life. And to hear what has happened in the last while with Cesar is just heartbreaking,"" Scarborough told WRAL-TV. Scarborough said the last time he saw Sayoc was about ""four or five years ago"" when Sayoc visited Brevard to attend Scarborough’s induction into the Athletic Hall of Fame. In that same  According to the Brevard College Tornados’ website, Scarborough was inducted in 2015. A profile on a coach named Israel ""Izzy"" Hernandez, who was inducted into the North Carolina Soccer Hall of Fame in 2009, says that he spent his first two years of college from 1980-82 at Brevard College — the same time that Scarborough was a coach and that Sayoc was on the soccer team. A 2007 Sports Illustrated article also profiles Hernandez’s coaching achievements. And in 2006, the News & Observer in Raleigh, NC, published a profile of the Cuban-born Hernandez, a piece that included his full name: Israel Abel Hernandez, then age 44. We searched campaign donor records and couldn’t find donations by anyone that seemed to fit the profile of Israel Abel Hernandez, who appears to be Sayoc’s old soccer buddy. The Federal Election Commission database of individual political contributions show 27 recent campaign donations made by people named Israel Hernandez — six made during 2017-18 and 21 made in 2016-17. Of those, none of the people named Israel Hernandez are from North Carolina. We searched the FEC’s database a little more, this time going all the way back to 1985-86 and found no one from North Carolina by the name of Israel Hernandez who made any campaign donations in any of those years. Nor did we find any documentation by donations of anyone by the name of ""Izzy Hernandez"" in any of the years going back to 1985-86. Similarly, opensecrets.org, which draws its data from the FEC, shows no record of any political donations coming from an Israel or Izzy Hernandez from North Carolina for any election cycle going back to 1990. The voter who is registered under the name ""Israel Abel Hernandez"" — the same full name of soccer coach and Brevard College alumnus who was profiled in 2006 in the News & Observer — is listed as politically ""unaffiliated."" We tried to reach Izzy Abel Hernandez, but were not able to locate him by phone.  A viral photo claims that pipe bomb suspect Cesar Sayoc was photographed with a Democratic donor named Izzy Hernandez. We don’t know for sure who the man in the photo is. But his photo resembles those of a man named Israel Hernandez, a former soccer coach who played soccer on the same teams Cesar Sayoc once played on and later became inducted into the North Carolina Soccer Hall of Fame. While it does appear Sayoc is pictured with a man named Israel ""Izzy"" Hernandez, we don’t find any indication that Hernandez is a Democrat or a donor to Democratic campaigns. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A55066ED80>],/factchecks/2018/nov/01/blog-posting/viral-photo-does-not-show-pipe-bomb-suspect-cesar-/
"['Taxes', 'Illinois', 'Sean Casten']","
Casten tax claim taxed by facts
","The effects of the new GOP tax law have played an outsized role in the tight race for the west suburban 6th Congressional District where U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam, a key architect of the landmark overhaul, is fighting for his seat against Democratic challenger Sean Casten. The two met for their final televised debate last week, and afterwards we gave Roskam a Pants on Fire! for making a claim about a Washington Post fact-check he said debunked attacks over his position on safeguarding health insurance protections for those with pre-existing conditions. No such fact-check exists. At that same debate, Casten also leveled a claim that left us puzzled. It involved the tax law, which Roskam accused the Democrat of misrepresenting. ""Sean has also taken on a tactic of going door to door out in the western suburbs putting notice [sic] on people’s homes telling them that their taxes are going to go up,"" the Republican said. ""And that’s not true."" Casten then rattled off numbers in an effort to demonstrate that he, not Roskam, was the truth-teller when it came to the tax law. ""If you live in Hinsdale, Illinois, your average state and local taxes are $45,000 a year,"" Casten said. ""You are now being double-taxed to the tune of $35,000."" For starters, Casten’s choice of words was murky. Did he mean Hinsdale taxpayers were facing a $35,000 increase on their tax bills? Or did he mean that $35,000 more of their income was now exposed to being taxed because of Roskam and his fellow Republicans? More broadly, though, we wondered if Casten might be right that most Hinsdale residents will pay more under the GOP law. The first questions are easy to answer. A Casten spokeswoman pointed us to IRS data that made it clear that when he invoked the term double-taxing he did not intend to suggest that average tax bills were going up by $35,000. For 2015, Hinsdale residents who took the so-called SALT deduction for state income and property taxes claimed an average for that category of more than $48,000. The next year the average claim in Hinsdale was nearly $44,000. The new tax law now caps SALT deductions at $10,000, meaning that roughly $35,000 would have been disallowed for deductions each year if the rules had been in effect in 2015 and 2016. But it’s important to note that the SALT cap doesn’t exist in a vacuum. The tax overhaul made a number of other changes, from lowering federal tax rates to raising or allowing more people to benefit from various exemptions and credits. In Hinsdale, where the 2016 median income was $173,500 according to census figures, it’s likely a number of residents stand to benefit from other alterations in the law, among them an expanded credit for children and a doubling of the standard deduction. Casten’s argument also relies on the tax experience of an average Hinsdale resident, which is misleading on multiple levels. Nearly 40 percent of filers in Hinsdale didn’t itemize deductions on their 2016 returns, opting instead to take the standard deduction. The SALT cap is likely to mean nothing to these filers in the future, since they didn’t take the deduction in the first place. Hinsdale may be a well-to-do suburb, but those at the very top of the income heap benefit far more from itemizing their deductions than do everybody else. IRS data show that 37 percent of tax filers in Hinsdale listed income of $200,000 or more in 2016, yet those filers accounted for nearly 82 percent of dollars claimed for itemized deductions that year. ""You’re not talking about the typical person in that particular jurisdiction,"" said Jon Davis, an expert at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who directs that school's Institute of Government & Public Affairs. ""You’re talking about an average, which is skewed. That in itself can be misleading to the public."" The broader question posed by Casten’s claim is whether the average Hinsdale resident would be hit by an actual tax increase because of the actions of Roskam and his fellow Republicans. That’s what fliers posted around Hinsdale and several other towns by Casten’s campaign contend. ""Your tax bill could increase an average of $19,169 due to the loss of State and Local Property Tax (SALT) deductions,"" the fliers read. To back up that claim, Casten’s spokeswoman sent us a spreadsheet detailing the campaign’s calculations. The spreadsheet, however, makes it clear that $19,169 figure refers to a diminished SALT deduction, not a tax increase. ""The disallowed deduction is not the tax effect,"" Davis, the accounting expert, said. ""The tax effect is the disallowed deduction times the tax rate."" In short, the campaign fell short in basic math. But even if they had done it correctly, other provisions in the tax law mean an increase in federally taxable income due to the SALT cap won’t necessarily translate into a tax hike for many in Hinsdale or other communities in the congressional district. The Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning group with a solid reputation for number-crunching, created an online calculator that attempts to account for the tax law changes, including the SALT cap. To test it out, we plugged in information for a married couple making $200,000 with no children who itemized their return but filed only for SALT with the average itemized amount for state and local taxes in Hinsdale. Even in that limited situation, the Tax Foundation calculates such a family would receive a tax cut of about $1,000 under the new law. Add two children and the savings increase to $5,000, thanks to the law’s expanded child tax credit. Casten said that under the GOP tax law, ""if you live in Hinsdale, Illinois … you are now being double-taxed to the tune of $35,000."" His vague debate comment suggests — and fliers his campaign have posted around the area claim — that because of the cap on SALT deductions, residents could be hit with massive increases on their tax bill for 2018. But Casten’s statement ignores the reality that the calculation of any tax averages for Hinsdale are heavily skewed by a minority of residents who are very wealthy. It also fails to recognize the many other factors at play in the new tax law. The Republican overhaul made several changes to past tax law, some of which may come as a benefit to taxpayers and some of which may not. By focusing only on the downside, and exaggerating its impact at that, Casten’s claim greatly distorts the tax situation for the constituents he seeks to serve. We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DA163C0>],/factchecks/2018/oct/31/sean-casten/casten-tax-claim-taxed-facts/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Crime', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump's wild number of sanctuary city criminal releases
","As President Donald Trump races across the country to gin up Republican support in the midterms, he warns his audiences that Democrats are the party of crime. In Erie, Pa., Trump attacked Democratic Sen. Bob Casey for supporting a policy that Trump said put people in his own state at risk. ""Bob Casey is fighting to protect violent criminal aliens,"" Trump said Oct. 10. ""That's what he's doing. Bob Casey voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities that released thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvania streets, to prey all over this country."" We decided to look at whether so-called ""sanctuary cities"" are as quick to release dangerous criminals as Trump said. They aren’t. While the details vary from place to place, the term sanctuary city is shorthand for any jurisdiction that won’t hold a person at the end of their jail or prison sentence solely because Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, wants to deport them. Trump reliably wields this against Democrats at his rallies. In Murphysboro, Ill., he said, ""Democrat sanctuary cities release these criminal aliens out of jail and right onto your streets."" In Mosinee, Wisc., he said, ""They strongly support sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal law enforcement and release known gang members, predators, criminal aliens into our communities."" We reached out to the White House for the details behind these claims and did not hear back. Specific to Casey and his voting record, based on the Pennsylvania Republican Party website, the charge goes back to Casey not supporting a 2016 bill that would have cut federal grants to sanctuary cities. On a largely party line vote, the measure failed to clear a procedural hurdle and died. The most recent numbers from ICE paint a blurry picture of what’s going on. In response to questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee about gangs, particularly the violent MS-13 gang with ties to El Salvador, ICE said there were 142 instances where jurisdictions nationwide released known or suspected gang members. The releases took place over about nine months between October 2016 and June 2017. The agency said 15 suspected MS-13 members were released, and 127 members of other gangs. The figure are less solid than they appear. ICE noted that it couldn’t say for sure that these were actual gang members, nor could it say that the releases were due to a lack of cooperation from local authorities. It told the senators that the numbers might not reflect ""potential administrative errors,"" or ""the jurisdiction’s actual level of cooperation and support."" It also said that the count included times when jurisdictions told ICE that a person’s sentence was about to end ""but ICE may not have been able to arrange a custody transfer prior to an alien’s release."" ICE press releases report instances of ignored detention requests, but sometimes the people are let free by local authorities and then arrested by ICE within a day. This suggests some level of coordination that the data wouldn’t capture. In March 2017, three counties in Maryland disputed an ICE report that said they had ignored its requests to detain certain people. They said they never received those notices. ICE has arrested people with violent criminal records after local authorities released them. For example, in 2016, New York City arrested a Mexican national for drunk driving. Some time before he had served five years for a robbery with a deadly weapon and been deported. ICE sent a detention request Dec. 31, 2016, the day he was released. ICE arrested him a few weeks later. Trump spoke of thousands and thousands of dangerous immigrants released in Pennsylvania and the nation overall. But with ICE counting at most 142 cases nationwide for possible gang members, and the caveats that come with that figure, there’s no evidence for Trump’s sky-high number for a single state. Lost in this debate are the details in the various sanctuary policies around the country. In particular, they treat dangerous criminals differently. ""A number of the sanctuary policies have carve-outs for individuals with certain types of felony offenses, and some non-felony offenses,"" said Annie Lai, clinical professor of law at the University of California Irvine. ""You want to see if the policy allows for detention for ICE, notification to ICE, transfer to ICE or transfer only with a warrant. Each of these mean different things."" California law has a long list of crimes that give local officials the leeway to hold someone for ICE after they’ve served their time. The list includes gang-related offenses, assault, battery, sexual abuse and exploitation, rape, crimes endangering children, burglary, robbery, theft, fraud, forgery, any crime resulting in death, some domestic violence offenses, and drug and weapon-related offenses. Orange County, Calif., uses that flexibility to the utmost. It reported that in the first five months of 2018, it turned 316 inmates over to ICE. At the same time, it reported that it released 414 people and 45 of those were later arrested. Drug violations and resisting a police officer were the most common offenses, but two were for attempted murder. (It’s important to note that arrests are not the same as convictions.) The point is, as a rule, sanctuary laws allow for more dangerous offenders to be held for deportation. There is no detailed Democratic policy on this. Congressional Democrats broadly favor sanctuary city policies, and the party platform emphasizes the deportation of ""those who pose a threat to the safety of our communities."" Former President Barack Obama pushed for removals, and leaned on some cities, including Philadelphia, to do more to help ICE. Recent Democratic bills that touch on the issue ensure that state and local law enforcement can arrest and detain ""previously-deported illegal aliens who have been convicted of a felony."" Trump said that Casey supported policies that had led to the release of ""thousands and thousands"" of dangerous criminal immigrants and ""vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvania."" The White House provided no evidence to back that up. Casey opposed a bill that would have penalized cities that didn’t cooperate fully with ICE. ICE reported the release of 142 suspected gang members nationwide. The agency itself gave many reasons to question the figure, including the accuracy of the count of actual gang members and the connection to sanctuary city policies. No ICE data supports Trump’s thousands of releases in Pennsylvania or the country as a whole. Sanctuary cities' policies generally allow for detention of felons, which would include the sort of people Trump warns about. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A550688800>],/factchecks/2018/oct/31/donald-trump/donald-trumps-wild-number-sanctuary-city-criminal-/
