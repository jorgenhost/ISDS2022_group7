Disney wanted to build in Miami-Dade but county told them 'to take a hike,' Dennis Moss says
","A battle over whether to turn a swath of trees near the Zoo Miami into an amusement park has touched off a debate about whether Disney decades ago wanted to build in Miami-Dade and whether county officials told Disney ""to take a hike."" County commissioners will consider declaring the area blighted at a March 3 hearing which could pave the way for developers to build a $930 million 20th Century Fox amusement park. Environmentalists vow to fight the plan. County Commissioner Dennis Moss, who has advocated for an amusement park in his district, told the Miami Herald that the land had been planned for redevelopment for years. And he says the county shouldn’t miss another opportunity to have an amusement park. ""When Disney was looking to build Disney World, they came to Miami and we told Disney to take a hike, and they took a hike to Central Florida. You see the economic impact they had on Central Florida. We have a chance to do that with 20th Century Fox in our community,"" he said in a Dec. 19 article. His claim set off a flurry of letters to the editor by readers who debated whether Disney World  considered Miami-Dade as a site and if local officials rejected it. Here’s one from prominent South Florida attorney Ben Kuehne: ""I wonder who were the unidentified officials in then-Dade County who told Disney to ‘take a hike,’ when Disney does not seem to have ever expressed an interest in South Florida as a potential location for its Disney World attraction. To the contrary, official Disney history is that Disney particularly chose Central Florida in order to not compete with existing tourism areas on the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico. Is Moss trying to pull a fast one on the Miami-Dade residents in his haste to pursue a massive theme park development in his district, contending that we lost a nonexistent opportunity once and cannot afford to do so 50 years later?"" But then Larry Capp, former executive director of the governmental entity Metro-Miami Action Plan during the 1980s, wrote a letter saying that Moss is correct. Capp’s information is based on conversations he had with the late County Mayor Stephen R. Clark in the 1980s. Clark ""never deviated from his account that Disney wanted to come to Miami,"" Capp wrote. But the negotiations with the county commission fell apart when Disney demanded that the county pay for infrastructure, Capp wrote. He added that Disney had already acquired large parcels in the county in the area that is now Trump National Doral. (Clark, who has since died, was first elected to the Miami city commission in 1963 and later became county mayor.) Time to pull out PolitiFact’s Truth-O-Meter: Did Disney consider Miami-Dade and did county officials tell Disney to go take a hike? Take a wild ride with us as we try to separate the lore from the truth about the twists and turns in the development of Disney World. Moss uncertain of his source Moss, who was first elected in 1993, told PolitiFact Florida that he couldn’t recall any specific source for his claim. ""I don’t have anything in writing,"" he said. But Moss pointed to Capp’s letter as ""witness testimony."" While it is certainly possible that during the 1980s Clark told Capp this information about Disney from decades ago, that’s not indisputable evidence in our book. County officials were unable to pinpoint any specific evidence to support Moss’ claim. Moss acknowledged it could be difficult to prove exactly what happened. ""Disney is about fairy tales and storybook endings, so who knows what transpired back in the 1950s?"" Historians on the alleged Miami-Dade option At PolitiFact we prefer history books to story books, so we interviewed several authors and historians who extensively researched the development of Disney World. None of them found evidence that Disney considered Miami-Dade. Disney hired leisure-time economics analyst Harrison ""Buzz"" Price to research Disney World locations. Price looked at several states and locations in Florida, but the closest one to Miami-Dade was in Palm Beach County, which Disney ultimately rejected. Price wrote in his book ""Walt’s Revolution by the Numbers"" about how Disney ultimately chose Orlando. ""In 1961, after rejecting some other alternatives, Walt asked us to look at the rest of Florida and figure out where the park should be. Late in 1963, we studied in depth a location in Central Florida. The key conclusion was that central Florida (not Miami as most people expected it would be) was the main point of maximum intersection of Florida tourism, and that Orlando, centrally located, what's the point of maximum access to the southerly flow of Florida tourism from both the east and west shores of the state…"" (Price has since died.) Disney announced the Orlando project in 1965, and the park opened in 1971. There were, however, Miami connections. When Disney acquired land in the Orlando area, Disney set up dummy corporations in Miami to hide that it was acquiring the property, said Disney Family Museum historian Paula Sigman Lowery. Disney was secretive about his plans as he was buying land because he didn’t want prices to skyrocket. Disney used Miami lawyer Paul Helliwell, who as a CIA agent had relocated to Miami in 1960 to carry out actions against Castro. Helliwell came up with the approach to create essentially fake cities for Disney World, wrote author T.D. Allman in Finding Florida. Five authors of books about Disney -- Rollins College professor Richard Foglesong, T.D. Allman, Sam Gennawey, Jim Korkis and Chad Emerson -- all told PolitiFact Florida that during their research they found no evidence that Disney considered Miami-Dade. ""I say this from having extensively researched the Disney land-purchase story, based on research at the Disney archives in Burbank and a close reading of legal documents involving depositions of key Disney players as reported in a book published by Yale University Press and fact-checked to the smallest detail,"" Foglesong told PolitiFact Florida in an email. Foglesong added, ""I can’t say that it’s not true, I can only say I did not find evidence to that claim."" Experts told us that Disney did not want to build near the beach which would compete with his amusement park. But Korkis said that there are gaps in historical records which are based in part on oral history. ""The Disney Archives was not created until 1970, and it stumbled for a decade trying to locate and organize papers, and even today there are huge gaps. When it comes to Disney history, there are things that the Imagineers refer to as ‘logical erroneous conclusions,’ things that sound reasonable but are completely wrong,"" he said. ""Often, people sincerely believe something is true."" Miami Herald researcher Monika Leal looked through two boxes of news clips from the newspaper in the 1960s about Disney World and found no reference to Disney considering Miami-Dade County. But wait a second ....  There was a time when Miami politicians talked to Disney executives about building some type of attraction in the county, but it wasn’t Disney World, says Maurice Ferre, who was mayor of Miami from 1973 to 1985 The Miami Herald wrote multiple articles about Ferre’s push to bring an amusement park to Watson Island. Disney executives toured the Watson Island site in 1984, but in 1985, the Miami Herald reported that Disney rejected the idea. ""What I wanted was to develop on Watson Island a mini-Disney park,"" Ferre told PolitiFact Florida. We asked Moss and Capp if the lore about Disney and Miami-Dade could be related to Watson Island in the 1980s, rather than the actual Disney World project in the 1960s. Moss said he wasn’t aware of the Watson Island project, however ,""What I heard was in reference to Disney World."" ""Gosh I really don’t know,"" Capp said. Mayor Clark ""never mentioned Watson Island or anything downtown or the waterfront. He strictly said the Doral area. .... This is becoming quite a mystery."" Our ruling Moss said, ""When Disney was looking to build Disney World, they came to Miami and we told Disney to take a hike."" At PolitiFact we believe that politicians need to back up their claims, and in this case Moss said he doesn’t have a documented source. The account by Capp that former Mayor Clark told him in the 1980s that this happened decades before doesn’t provide first-hand evidence. And it’s the only piece of evidence we found in favor of Moss’s point. The historians we interviewed said they had never seen evidence to support the claim that Disney considered Miami-Dade for Disney World. If we later find evidence that shows Disney considered Miami-Dade for Disney World, we will revisit this fact-check, but so far Moss has failed to prove his claim, so we rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB99AA80>],/factchecks/2015/jan/09/dennis-moss/disney-wanted-build-miami-dade-county-told-him-tak/

Milwaukee's NBA team is younger than Marquette University team, Milwaukee Bucks exec says
","Laying the groundwork for their proposal for a new downtown arena -- including a pitch for public financing -- the new owners and executives of the Milwaukee Bucks are touting a new era for pro basketball in the city. A new arena will allow the Bucks to play a more active role in the community, team president Peter Feigin said Jan. 6, 2015 at a luncheon sponsored by the Rotary Club of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Press Club. The Bucks players, he said, will play a crucial role in the efforts to build goodwill. ""In the next few months we’re going to be humanizing our players, getting them out,"" Feigin said. ""We actually have 15 good guys who love being in Milwaukee and want to start doing it."" He added: ""They haven’t been out on the marketplace because….they also happen to be younger than the Marquette team. And we have to actually coach them and kind of teach them what it’s like to live alone and be an NBA professional player."" The Bucks certainly are young. The two most recent draft picks were Greek teenager Giannis Antetokounmpo (now 20) and rookie forward Jabari Parker, who left Duke after his freshman season. But younger than a college team? Time to dial up the rosters. The Golden Eagles have a somewhat different lineup from when the season began. Marquette lost two players, Deonte Burton, 20, and John Dawson, 19, who left the team in December 2014 and were replaced by a pair of walk-ons --  twins Michael and Matthew Mache, 21. The average age of the Golden Eagles at the start of the season was 20.4 years old; it’s now 20.9. According to NBA.com, at the start of the season the Bucks were the second youngest team in the NBA with an average age of 23.7. The team was second to the Philadelphia 76ers, with an average age of 23.4 years, and just ahead of four teams -- New Orleans, Minnesota, Boston and Orlando -- all tied with an average age of 24.9. A couple of birthdays pushed the Bucks’ average age to 24 years old at the time of Feigin’s claim. So, in terms of the average age, Feigin clanked one off the rim. His broader point, of course, was that the Bucks team is very young. Some other comparisons with the Marquette team underscore that point. For instance, the Golden Eagles have only one teenager -- 19-year-old Sandy Cohen III, a freshman -- on their 10 man roster. Four are age 21. The Bucks have two teens -- Parker and Damien Inglis. (Both are out for the season with injuries but remain on the roster.) Antetokounmpo, in his second season, turned 20 in December 2014. Also, four Bucks players are under the age of 22, which makes them younger than some of the Marquette players. Also eight players -- more than half the team -- are under the age of 24. The average age of the Bucks is skewed a bit by six players over the age of 26, including the oldest Buck, center Zaza Pachulia, who is 30. (Feigin’s claim came before news that the team signed free agent forward Kenyon Martin, who is 37, and waive guard Nate Wolters, 23. Those moves push the Bucks’ average age to 24.9.) Our rating In building the case for a new arena, Feigin says his team will become more engaged with the community -- and that the young Bucks were learning about life as professional ballplayers. The team did start the season as the second youngest of 30 NBA teams. But the claim we are looking at is whether they are younger on average than the Marquette squad. They are not. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACCF900>],/factchecks/2015/jan/09/peter-feigin/milwaukees-nba-team-younger-its-leading-college-ba/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker claims credit for $816 in property tax savings over ""where things were headed""
","In November 2013, Gov. Scott Walker earned the seventh of his eight Pants on Fire ratings by saying that because of actions taken during his first term, ""the typical Wisconsin homeowner will save approximately $680"" in property taxes over four years. We judged the statement to be not only inaccurate but ridiculous because the $680 wasn’t actual money saved. Rather, the figure was strictly based on a hypothetical scenario, which the governor didn’t disclose in making the claim. More than a year later, as his second term approached, Walker toured the state to tout his property tax relief measures. And he made a similar claim. ""The difference over the last four years between where things were headed and where we brought them to over the last four years ""is a total of $816 in saved property tax money,"" Walker said on Dec. 17, 2014, according to a La Crosse TV station. Though his wording may have been a bit hard to follow, the governor was claiming an even larger savings in property taxes. But he was more careful to say he was comparing his four years as governor to the previous four years. Let’s put that claim to the Truth-O-Meter. Median property tax bills Here are the annual property tax bills for a median-valued home, based on a statewide average tax rate, as estimated by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. We compared the change in the final four years of Democrat Jim Doyle’s term with the four years of Walker’s first term.   Year Amount 2006 $2,733 2007 $2,836 2008 $2,856 2009 $2,919 2010 $2,963 Change during Doyle’s second term -- 2010 vs 2006 +$230 2011 $2,953 2012 $2,943 2013 $2,922 2014 $2,822 Change during Walker’s first term -- 2014 vs 2010  -$141 So, the median property tax bill increased in each of the final four years that Doyle was governor, and has decreased in each of the four years under Walker. But the total four-year savings under Walker is $141 -- not $816. To reach that figure, Walker again uses a hypothetical. Walker argues that had the median property tax bill continued to increase each year at the same pace it did under Doyle -- it would have been $69 larger in Walker’s first year, $140 larger in the second, $222 larger in the third and $385 in the fourth -- a total of $816 more, when the four years are combined.  As a math problem, that works. But as we pointed out in rating Walker’s earlier property tax claim, he assumes that another governor, faced with the same state budget deficit he inherited, would have continued to allow local governments to raise property taxes at that 8 percent clip over an additional four years. Maybe that would have happened. And maybe not. Our rating Walker said: ""The difference over the (previous) four years between where things were headed and where we brought them to over the last four years is a total of $816 in saved property tax money."" But he is comparing real results -- property tax decreases during his four years as governor -- to hypothetical results -- how much higher property taxes would have been had they increased like they did during the previous four years under the previous governor. The property taxes on a median-value property ""were headed"" toward being $816 higher over four years -- if the pace of increases had continued. But that’s a big if. And the actual four-year savings under Walker is only $141. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

"['Georgia', 'Agriculture', 'Economy', 'State Budget', 'Georgia Farm Bureau']","
Does agriculture contribute $71 billion to Georgia's economy?
","The new year brings with it a new legislative session and updated annual figures on agriculture statistics such as the average yield of, say, peanut farms. Those two factors combine in the budget process, when state lawmakers make policy decisions based, in part, by who is affected by their decisions. An alert reader had that process in mind when asking PolitiFact Georgia to check an oft-repeated claim by the Georgia Farm Bureau and politicians: Agriculture is the Peach State’s top industry. How big? The headline on a Georgia Farm Bureau web page touts, ""Georgia Agriculture – The state’s $71 billion industry."" A bullet point underneath is a bit more nuanced. ""Agriculture contributes more than $71.1 billion annually to Georgia's economy,"" it reads. The distinction matters, as we’ll get to in a minute. But before we get into semantics, we have to delve into some economics. We contacted the farm bureau, which directed us to the 2013 Ag Snapshot published by the Center for Agribusiness and Economic Development at the University of Georgia. The center conducts an annual survey which allows farmers to report acreage, yield, crop price and other details. The 2013 report – which looks at 82 commodities using 2011 data – concludes the direct economic value of agriculture is $13 billion. Two pages later, it concludes that direct value, combined with the values along the supply chain from fertilizer and seed to first-line processing plants, ""generated a total economic impact of $71.1 billion"" for Georgia. How? Center officials told us they add to the the $13 billion what the actual economic value (using federal data compiled by a private firm) of the businesses along the ag supply chain. In 2011, the tally was $44 billion. It then induces a multiplier, adding in what workers in all of those jobs spend on daily living, to arrive at the $71 billion figure. ""We are looking at the contribution of all the sectors related to agriculture,"" said center economist Sharon Kane. ""It’s so much more meaningful to report the overall impact."" The IMPLAN Group LLC, the North Carolina firm that operates the input-output modeling system and provides the figures for ag-related sectors, did not return calls to confirm data. We also contacted the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to try to verify the agriculture numbers. It couldn’t, exactly. The agency’s Economic Research Service division can offer only somewhat comparable data in its Farm Income and Wealth Statistics tables. According to that division, Georgia’s net valued added by farms in 2011 was $2.9 billion. That’s a huge difference from between the $13 billion that farmers reported. Definitions account for part of the gap – Georgia counts timber, nurseries and agriculture tourism such as hunting licenses, while the federal agency does not. But even then, there is at least a $9 billion gap between state and federal figures. To make sense of that gap, and the calculations themselves, PolitiFact Georgia reached out to Bruce Seaman, an economist who studies economic impacts of projects and industries. Seaman, a professor of economics at Georgia State University, said the varying definitions of agriculture likely accounts for much of the massive gap in the figures. More concerning, he said, is the mixing of ""impact"" and ""contribution"" when throwing around the $71 billion figure. The Agribusiness report answers the question of how much activity is going on in agriculture and its related industries. That is the industry contribution, Seaman said. It is a snapshot of the industry, which shows agriculture makes up about 10 percent of the overall state economy. That’s very different than saying it has the same impact, or importance, he said. Consider:  In 1905, about a third of all jobs in the United States were in agriculture. But Seaman said that did not mean those jobs had a proportional impact on the overall economy, or the United States would have collapsed as jobs moved into manufacturing. ""It describes how much activity is linked to an industry,"" he said. ""But it does not mean that if the agriculture industry declined by half, the economy would suffer a $35 or $36 billion loss."" So, looking at the big picture, is agriculture Georgia’s largest industry? Think of it as a pie (pecan, of course. Made in Georgia). Based on the state and federal data – and adding in sectors that are directly linked to growing cotton and raising broilers – the $71 billion figure might be a bit too high, but can be mostly verified. But that figure is simply agriculture’s slice of the pie that is Georgia’s economy. In this study, making ag’s slice smaller or larger doesn’t make the pie any bigger. Agriculture is the largest single component in the state economy. But it requires another type of study to know its actual economic impact. The Georgia Farm Bureau statement is accurate, but needs some additional context to fully understood. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC697C40>],/factchecks/2015/jan/09/georgia-farm-bureau/71-billion-question-what-value-or-impact-agricultu/

Kohn: Since 9/11, right-wing extremists killed more Americans than Islamic extremists
","The cold-blooded killing of a dozen people at the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical weekly in Paris, has inflamed the debate over the ties between Islam and extremist violence. The gunmen’s motive is hardly in doubt. A video captured one of them shouting ""Allahu Akbar!"", or ""God is great"" in Arabic. Liberal pundit Sally Kohn waded into the firestorm on Twitter. At one point, seeing what she called  ""repeated condemnation of Islam as a whole,"" Kohn wrote, ""Since 9/11, right-wing extremists (incl anti-abortion, anti-gov) have killed more Americans than Islamic extremists."" We decided to check Kohn’s numbers. Kohn’s tweet linked to a CNN opinion piece that in turn was based on data gathered by the New America Foundation, a Washington think tank that promotes data-driven innovation to social and economic policy. By the New America count, in the time since 9/11, jihadists have killed 26 Americans on U.S. soil, while those with right-wing leanings have killed 39. The single-most deadly event by an Islamic extremist was the 13 people killed at Fort Hood. On the right-wing side of the ledger, the worst was the six people slain at a Sikh Temple in Wisconsin. The first thing to note is that Kohn’s tweet failed to specify that the deaths took place in the United States. Kohn explained that she counted on people to use the link in the tweet to fill in that detail. We hunted around for a count of Americans -- aside from military and such -- who were killed by terrorists while overseas and came up dry. Judgment calls Conservatives have challenged the New America tally. An article on Breitbart charged that the analysis wrongly attributed some of the killings to right-wing zealots when the ideological connection was weak. For example, in 2009, Joshua Cartwright shot and killed two police officers in Fort Walton Beach, Fla. Cartwright had beaten his wife and then driven to a local shooting range. When two deputies found him there, he shot them, fled, and was later killed in a shootout with police. Cartwright’s ties to right-wing extremists? The sheriff said Cartwright was interested in militia groups and thought the government was conspiring against him. His wife said he held anti-government views and was disturbed by the election of Barack Obama. All told, the Breitbart article questioned enough deaths to tip the count. In order to reach that point, however, it needed to add in the 10 victims of John Allen Muhammad, the so-called Beltway Sniper who terrorized the Washington metro area with his random shootings in 2002. Muhammad attended a mosque in Seattle, but financial setbacks and the loss of custody of his children seemed to have triggered his killing spree. Leave those deaths out of the equation for slayings on American soil, and the edge, however slender, still goes to the right-wing extremists. By our count, the Breitbart article came up three deaths short. For the record, this analysis deals only with fatalities even though some of the Islamic-driven violence in this country, such as the Boston Marathon bombing and the Fort Hood shootings, left many with permanent, life-changing injuries. No easy way to count If this exercise shows nothing else, it is that the number of post-9/11 deaths in the United States from either cause is low, and drawing firm conclusions is dicey. A single event or a change in definitions can shift the balance. The matter of definitions makes a big difference because most of the killers acted on their own. Experts in terrorist and extremist violence told PunditFact that in these cases, it can be difficult to draw the line between ideological and purely personal motivations. Alex Schmid is a research fellow at the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism in the Netherlands. ""Mental illness plays a role in up to 40 percent of the lone wolf attacks,"" Schmid said. In contrast, he said most organized terrorists are ""clinically normal."" William Braniff at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland also said this is the most challenging part of any assessment. Braniff said the best research approach is to include any violence that might be tied to extremist beliefs. But also, be sure to include enough details so others can separate the clear cases from the murky ones. ""If I am a law enforcement official or a policymaker, I might want to know if or how violent ideologies attract those who are mentally unstable because ultimately, that suggests that more resources ought to be directed to mental health interventions,"" Braniff said. Our ruling Kohn said that since 9/11, right-wing extremists have killed more Americans than Islamic extremists. She drew that from a database created by the New America Foundation which found 26 victims of jihadists compared to 39 of right-wing zealots. That count is limited to deaths on American soil. Kohn didn’t include this context in her tweet, though she did include a link that clarified that point. The tally itself is subject to certain judgment calls and has been criticized on that basis. Also, there are times when the motives of the Islamic and right-wing extremists are difficult to separate from underlying mental illness. The evidence suggests that while the margin might be small, it still falls on the side of slightly more deaths due to right-wing extremists. But the experts we talked to led us to conclude that a definitive answer is challenging. Given these uncertainties, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB37080>],/factchecks/2015/jan/08/sally-kohn/kohn-911-right-wing-extremists-killed-more-america/
"['Taxes', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
People moved $2 trillion worth of income to escape high taxes, Scott says
","Rick Scott began his second term as Florida’s governor in much the same fashion as he started his first -- by railing against high taxes. In his inaugural address on Jan. 6, 2015, Scott boasted that scads of people had moved to Florida in recent years, allegedly lured by the state’s lack of income tax and low cost of living. ""Over the last 20 years, millions of people have escaped from states with climbing tax rates to move to states with lower taxes,"" Scott said. ""For starters, estimates say individuals who escaped these high tax states have taken with them around $2 trillion of adjusted gross income. They’re voting with their feet."" Scott went on to point out that between 1992 to 2011, New York and Illinois had lost billions in adjusted gross income, and that ""their No. 1 destination was Florida."" The Sunshine State, meanwhile, had ""inherited"" more than $100 billion in adjusted gross income from other states in the same time period. Considering Florida just last year passed New York as the third-most populous state in the union, it’s obvious people are moving into the state. We wondered about the larger point here, whether $2 trillion in adjusted gross income transferred into Florida and other states to avoid higher taxes. Feet not really voting Scott’s office told us the estimate came from author and tax wonk Travis H. Brown’s book How Money Walks: How $2 Trillion Moved Between the States, and Why It Matters, which touts adjusted gross income movement as proof that states with high taxes persistently lose population and money to low-tax states. Brown’s publicist did not respond to our request for comment, so we couldn’t ask him specifics about his theory. His essential argument, according to his book, is that ""it appears that there is a direct correlation between state personal income tax rates and income migration. Money is walking, and we can see exactly where it’s going."" Brown combined Internal Revenue Service and Census data of the adjusted gross income (defined as all the money a person makes minus adjustments) of people who moved between states in a 15-year period between 1995 and 2010, using available records. He argued these stats show how these migrations affected states, including Florida, which is the largest net income beneficiary using this point of view, to the tune of $86.4 billion over 15 years, according to Brown. Similar conclusions about taxpayer migration have been drawn by the business-backed Tax Foundation and the New York-based Empire Center. The argument has become a popular anti-tax talking point, just as Scott used it. We ran Brown’s methodology by a number of experts, and we didn’t find many economists who know of Brown’s work well enough to comment on it. Brown identifies himself as a ""political consultant and legislative lobbyist by trade"" in his book. Cristobal Young, a Stanford sociologist who has co-authored studies on millionaire migration in New Jersey and California that found tax rates had little impact on migration, said he was familiar with Brown’s book and website but paid little attention to them because Brown’s conclusions are ""not an academic or scientific work."" One economist who did critique Brown was Michael Mazerov of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Mazerov said that it’s not clear from Brown’s book whether the $2 trillion number is meant to represent all the money moving out of high tax states into low tax states, or whether it’s simply the sum of all adjusted gross income moving across states, i.e. all the money that didn’t stay in the same state over a 15-year period. That’s a critical distinction, and we found contradictory wording in the book on that point. We tried to reach Travis to clear up this point, but we didn’t hear back. We’ll update this fact-check if we do. Looking at Brown’s website tool, Florida’s biggest gains were from New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania. But the state also lost residents to North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Arizona and Texas -- albeit far fewer people left the state, resulting in a net population gain. Florida is one of nine states with no individual income tax, along with Alaska, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming (some of those states do tax parts of a person’s income, such as investment dividends). That means that while Florida is gaining residents in net migration, a good chunk of people are still moving out to states that have higher taxes than Florida. States with no income tax also usually have higher property or sales tax rates to compensate. The Tax Foundation said Florida ranked 27th in tax burden back in 2010. Mazerov raised other issues with Brown’s theory, chiefly that it doesn’t consider the full dynamics of people moving between the states. First, it’s not as if taxed income simply evaporates or transfers if someone moves out of a state. In most cases, it’s likely someone else in the state takes a job when someone leaves it. The person who moves would then earn income from another employer in their new state. Lyman Stone, formerly an economist with the Tax Foundation, has agreed on Medium.com that Brown’s IRS data ""simply doesn’t show the migration of income, but rather shows the migration of people who formerly earned a given stream of income."" Tracking income migration also doesn’t account for people who move to new states but continue to work in their old ones, nor does it include people who move because they are laid off (their jobs simply don’t exist anymore) or are part-time residents of the state -- which accounts for an estimated 800,000 people in Florida. That brings us to a host of caveats about the supposition that people are moving to Florida -- or any other state, really -- primarily for lower taxes. Research shows that taxes simply aren’t a major consideration for people who move between states. Only about 2 percent or fewer Americans move between states in any given year, and factors such as new jobs, better weather, nearby family and housing costs are much more important. Brown’s book acknowledges these factors, but still focuses on the correlation with states with low or no individual income taxes. According to a recent Gallup poll, the national average of people who say they plan to move within the next year who cite taxes as a reason is only 3 percent. Even residents of Scott’s favorite punching bag, New York, only cited taxes 14 percent of the time as a reason for wanting to move. In Florida’s case, where the cost of living is no longer as inexpensive as it used to be, climate is an especially strong factor, and the trend of more people moving from so-called ""Frostbelt"" states to ""Sunbelt"" states has been going on for decades. The University of Florida’s Population Program in the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Florida has said jobs are the main reason people in their 20s, 30s and 40s move to the state, while climate is biggest for people in their 50s and 60s. One major factor common to all age groups? Family living in the area. Our ruling Scott said, ""Estimates say individuals who escaped these high-tax states have taken with them around $2 trillion in adjusted gross income."" That stat comes from an anti-tax advocate who measured the adjusted gross income of people who moved between states. There is disagreement about how much can be assumed by measuring that income migration, and even whether the $2 trillion in movement is among all 50 states or just from high-tax locations to lower-tax ones. In either case, there is plenty of research showing that of the relatively small number of people who move between states, very few of them cite taxes as a reason. We rate the statement Mostly False.

Mitch McConnell says economic uptick coincides with expectation of GOP Senate takeover
","In remarks from the Senate floor, newly elevated Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested that his party’s takeover of Senate control ""appears to coincide"" with recent good economic news. ""After so many years of sluggish growth, we’re finally starting to see some economic data that can provide a glimmer of hope,"" McConnell said. ""The uptick appears to coincide with the biggest political change of the Obama administration’s long tenure in Washington: the expectation of a new Republican Congress."" McConnell stopped short of saying the Republican Senate takeover actually caused an economic improvement, though many media observers assumed that was what he was trying to imply. In the liberal New Republic, Brian Beutler joked, ""It absolutely does coincide with the expectation of a new Republican Congress. Relatedly, things that coincide are called ‘coincidences.’ "" But is McConnell even right that the economic data and the political expectations coincided? We focused on two questions. First, when did ""the expectation of a new Republican Congress"" actually solidify? And second, was there an uptick in economic data that actually coincided with that time frame? We’ll also briefly address the question of causation, even though McConnell didn’t explicitly claim that. The data we found suggest McConnell is engaging in some wishful thinking. When did ""the expectation of a new Republican Congress"" actually emerge?  To answer this question, we checked with political analysts who handicapped the 2014 battle for the Senate and also looked at poll-based forecasting models. McConnell said ""expectation,"" a stronger word than ""possibility"" and one that requires a reasonable degree of consensus. Going into the 2014 Senate elections, most observers expected the GOP to gain seats, due primarily to a favorable map for the GOP (far more Democrats were up for re-election, especially in conservative states) combined with the longstanding history of ""six-year-itch"" midterm elections bedeviling second-term presidents, in this case Democrat Barack Obama. But whether the GOP would actually manage to win enough seats to seize control of the chamber -- six -- was less certain. Going into the election, the Democrats held a 55-45 edge (counting two Democratic-caucusing Independents as Democrats). With many individual races rated as highly competitive right through Election Day, winning a net six seats was no slam dunk. Jennifer Duffy, who handicaps Senate races for the Cook Political Report, said different political experts settled on a Republican takeover at different times but added that she felt ""pretty comfortable with a gain of six seats around Labor Day,"" which was on Sept. 1 last year. Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, agreed that Labor Day was a turning point, though he added that ""there were slivers of doubt right up until the end. We formally called the Senate for the Republicans the week before the election, but we also suggested that a GOP Senate was likely in the months prior to the election."" The forecasters at fivethirtyeight.com suggested the toss-up lasted past Labor Day. They calculated the likelihood of a GOP takeover at just over 50 percent as late as mid September, before rising again, ultimately to 76 percent on the eve of the election. The New York Times’ in-house forecast saw much the same pattern, narrowing to essentially a coin flip in mid September before climbing to a 75 percent chance of a GOP takeover by Election Day. All told, this suggests that an ""expectation"" of a GOP takeover didn’t emerge until the beginning of September at the earliest, and possibly as late as the second half of September. This leads to our next question. Has there been an economic ""uptick"" that ""appears to coincide"" with this timeline? McConnell’s office pointed us to the announcement that the economy grew at an annualized 5 percent rate in the third quarter of 2014, the biggest expansion in more than a decade. So we’ll start there. The figure was indeed impressive. But there are two problems with citing this as evidence for McConnell’s point. First, the third quarter covers July, August and September. So the bulk of this growth occurred before the expectation of a GOP Senate began to jell. Second, GDP growth for the second quarter -- covering April, May and June of 2014 -- was almost as impressive, 4.6 percent. And that was well before the ""expectation"" of a GOP takeover seemed to take hold. (In fact, for much of that quarter, the New York Times model showed the Democrats likelier to win control than the Republicans.) Indeed, the longer-term trend for GDP growth shows that three of the past five quarters -- that is, since mid 2013 -- have exceeded 4 percent growth, and another quarter came close to that. Only one quarter, the first quarter of 2014, was a dud. So it’s not as if the impressive third-quarter growth of 2014 came totally out of the blue.    Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis We also looked at another major yardstick for the economy -- the monthly change in employment. During 2014, total monthly employment gains averaged 241,000. In October -- the month after the ""expectation"" of a GOP takeover would have taken hold -- the gain was almost exactly that, 243,000. The November total was 321,000 -- the highest of the year, but not far out of line when compared with the general trend for job creation since early 2011 (see chart below). It’s too soon to tell whether November’s figure kicks off a new, higher threshold or whether the number settles back again into the 240,000 range.    Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics The strongest evidence for McConnell’s point is consumer confidence. The University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment did experience an uptick between November and December, but even with this measurement, confidence had been rising consistently since July. And other evidence actually points in the opposite direction. Data for new orders of capital goods -- a good statistic for gauging how much confidence there is in future economic conditions -- actually fell every month between August and November. The question of causation Even if the statistical timeline fit perfectly, it’s worth remembering that correlation does not equal causation. ""I don't think that either party has that much power to affect short-run economic movements, except by royally screwing up, and I haven't seen any evidence that the expectation of a regime change of this sort would affect economic outcomes,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. It’s even possible to draw up a theory that runs the opposite direction as McConnell’s linkage. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, said one reason GDP and employment have increased a bit faster in recent months ""is that government investment, government consumption, and public employee payrolls have recently been rising instead of falling."" Given this, McConnell’s comments linking the GOP and accelerated economic growth are ironic, Burtless said, since Republicans have been at the forefront of cutting government spending and payrolls. Our ruling McConnell said a recent economic uptick appears to ""coincide"" with ""the expectation of a new Republican Congress."" Even leaving aside the question of causation, key statistics show that the economic recovery was under way well before September, which is our best estimate for when the ""expectation"" of a GOP Senate solidified.

MSNBC host: Some GOP members said 'we don't know' where to put more border patrol agents
","We admit to feeling like we’ve heard it all before when it comes to debate on long-stalled immigration reform in Congress. Recently, though, we heard something new -- and if true, shocking -- in a little-noticed segment after the winter holidays. NBC News correspondent Craig Melvin was talking about the implications of the House speaker’s race for immigration policy and federal funding of immigration enforcement during the Jan. 5, 2015, edition of The Rundown with Jose Diaz-Balart (Melvin was filling in as host). The border is more secure since President Barack Obama took over, Melvin said, adding that some Republicans have actually conceded that things are going well in that department. ""There have even been Republican congressmen who have said, ‘If you give us more money we don't know where we would even put additional Border Patrol agents.’ Is that not accurate?"" Melvin asked his guests. We decided to check if it was. Did GOP members, who have made securing the border a priority over any type of amnesty, actually say they wouldn’t know where to place more Border Patrol agents if they approved the money? Melvin referred us to a Dec. 26 interview he conducted for MSNBC with Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky. Yarmuth is a Democrat, not a Republican, and a member of the House’s ""gang"" of eight who worked on a bipartisan immigration solution in 2013. The Senate had its own gang of eight; neither resulted in a law. Yarmuth told Melvin that Obama had done much to secure the border, and there were guards aplenty. Key to this fact-check, he relayed what he said were the words of two Texas Republicans. ""Illegal border crossings are about half what they were before the Obama administration took over. We have as many Border Patrol people on guard as we can possibly need. I was part of the group of eight in the House, the bipartisan group that worked on immigration reform during the last Congress, and our Texas members basically said we would not know where to put more border guards right now."" So Melvin’s comments come from Yarmuth, who says they came from two Texas members serving on the House’s gang of eight -- Republican Reps. John Carter and Sam Johnson. PunditFact reached out to Carter and Johnson several times and heard nothing back from their staff. Yarmuth’s office, meanwhile, didn’t offer us more details behind his comments. So we have very little to go on other than one congressman’s word, which was then repeated by an MSNBC host. But that doesn’t quite put us at a dead end. We can say we found no record of Carter or Johnson making the type of comment Yarmuth said they did in public. In fact, we found evidence of the opposite. Carter and Johnson left the immigration policy group in September 2013, announcing in a joint press release that they had ""a lack of faith"" in Obama’s enforcement approach and would support their GOP colleagues’ approach that ""starts with a genuinely secure border."" In an Aug. 11, 2014, interview with Fox Business Network, Carter made the case for additional border patrol agents along the Southern border. ""We have to put resources on the border,"" Carter said. ""Fencing, experience along the Rio Grande, is a very difficult issue because that's a very windy river, awfully hard to build. And remember, in Texas, we have private property that borders on our border in Texas. So all that fencing would have to be done on private property. ""We need to put the resources, the human resources, out there. I'm proud of our governor for sending our Texas Department of Public Safety down there, and a massive amount, and also, the willingness to use the Texas National Guard, both of which will assist an overwhelmed and very dedicated border patrol."" And a month earlier, Johnson issued a July 2014 statement calling on additional border patrol agents. ""As it is the responsibility of the federal government to secure our borders, Washington must do so now and send more border patrol agents to Texas. I will continue working to ensure Texas has the resources and manpower it needs to secure the border. It can and must be done."" We should note that both of these comments came at a time when many were upset by the influx of children crossing the border from Central America. The comments, however, came months before Yarmuth and then Melvin said the opposite. Victor Manjarrez, associate director of the National Center for Border Security & Immigration at the University of Texas at El Paso, said he never heard Carter or Johnson say the border didn’t need more manpower. ""Quite honestly that would be a little shocking to hear members of Congress from Texas saying that,"" Manjarrez said. ""You typically have members of Congress want to throw resources at you."" On the other hand, members of the federal enforcement community deemed a proposal to double the number of Border Patrol agents to about 39,000 unnecessary, said Manjarrez, who retired from the Border Patrol in May 2011 as a sector chief in Tucson, Ariz. After the Sept. 11 attacks, when border enforcement was moved to the newly created Department of Homeland Security, the number of border patrol agents doubled from about 2,000 in the 2002 fiscal year to more than 20,800 as of the 2014 fiscal year (a small decrease from 2013). Another doubling of resources within a year or so would be drastic, he said. ""When they talk about doubling the size of Border Patrol last year ... just from my previous experience and my peers that won’t be allowed to talk, that was really overkill,"" Manjarrez said. Our ruling Melvin said, ""There have even been Republican congressmen who have said, ‘If you give us more money we don't know where we would even put additional Border Patrol agents.’ "" Melvin got his information from an interview he conducted with a Democratic congressman who quoted two Texas Republicans as saying as much. But there is no public record of the two Texas Republicans, Reps. Carter and Johnson, saying remarks along those lines that we could find. While it may have transpired behind closed doors, we have no evidence that it did. What we do know is that both Texas congressmen have more recently advocated for additional border patrol agents, a fact that neither Yarmuth or Melvin mentioned. For Melvin, he accurately recounted what he heard. But in this game of telephone, all we get is a busy signal at the other end. Because of a lack of evidence, and the public comments of Carter and Johnson, we rate this claim Mostly False.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Louie Gohmert']","
Louie Gohmert says Obama has 'not proposed one' tax policy that implements 'Buffett rule'
","President Barack Obama has identified tax reform as one of the few areas where he thinks he could find some agreement with new Republican congressional leaders in the coming months. Taking it in the opposite direction, Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas -- who just ran a failed attempt to take over as speaker of the House -- said Congress should just do away with the current tax code to put Obama on the defensive. In an appearance on Fox News Jan. 5, he said that would show Republican constituents that members of Congress are standing up for conservative values. ""There are people in the party that are willing to stand up and fight for the very things we promised we would do,"" Gohmert said. ""We can put Obama on the defensive just by completing getting rid of the Internal Revenue code. I want a flat tax. Obama has said that, you know, it's a travesty for (billionaire Warren) Buffett to pay less in percentage than his secretary, yet he's not proposed one thing that would change that. We can do that."" Gohmert’s comment that Obama hasn’t proposed one measure to address tax inequality struck us as suspect right off the bat, considering Obama’s interest in tax legislation -- not to mention his well-publicized 2012 ""Buffett rule"" campaign. We asked Gohmert’s office for comment several times but didn’t hear back. The Buffett rule For years, Buffett, the chairman and CEO of holding company Berkshire Hathaway, has said several times he pays a lower percentage of his income in taxes than anyone else in his office -- including his secretary. In 2011, he said that he pays 17.4 percent of his income in taxes, while others in his office (who have much, much lower incomes) -- paid around 36 percent. Buffett, one of the richest people in the country, sees that as unfair and a problem. The discrepancy between Buffett and his secretary became a familiar refrain for other advocates of so-called tax fairness, including Obama. ""Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households,"" Obama said in his 2012 State of the Union address. ""Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary."" But Obama didn’t just mention the Buffett paradox in passing without offering a solution, as Gohmert implies. In the very same State of the Union speech, Obama made a proposal to change the tax code so that it complies with the ""Buffett rule"" -- which attempts to ensure that high-income people pay a certain percentage of their income in taxes that is at least higher than what middle-class people pay. ""Tax reform should follow the Buffett rule. If you make more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes,"" he said. ""Now, you can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense."" The Buffett rule proposal came to Congress in the form of the Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012, sponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and endorsed publically by Obama. (Procedurally, the president can’t introduce legislation; only members of Congress can.) The bill, which failed in the Senate that April, would have required all people making more than $2 million per year to pay a minimum tax rate of 30 percent. People making between $1 million and $2 million would see their minimum tax rates increase on a sliding scale up to 30 percent. Obama has proposed tax reform that involves observing the Buffett rule in his budget proposals for fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015. And it was a major point of his 2012 campaign, as he could point to the fact that his Republican challenger Mitt Romney paid an effective tax rate of 14 percent on his $42 million in earnings in 2010 and 2011. Caveats There is some debate over how many people would be impacted by the Paying a Fair Share Act and the Buffett rule. There’s also a lot of debate over whether or not the Buffett rule is good for the economy, or if it would further complicate the tax code, but neither of those are the point at issue here. The bill wouldn’t have affected all wealthy people in one sweeping motion. Most ultra-wealthy households already pay a higher effective tax rate than the average middle-class American, noted Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group. According to the 2012 Economic Report of the President, the median average tax rate for the middle 20 percent of Americans, in terms of earnings, was 13.3 percent. The median average tax rate for the top 1 percent of earners, on the other hand was 29.6 percent. Only one-tenth of that top 1 percent had an average tax rate lower than 10 percent. A quick note: Here, we’re talking about effective tax rate, which is the percentage of their income people ultimately paid in taxes. This is different from the marginal tax rate. The federal government designates several brackets of taxable income, which are all taxed at different rates. The marginal tax rate is the rate applied to a person’s last dollar earned above a certain threshold. The marginal and effective tax rates tend not to line up. Buffett and some other super-rich individuals pay lower tax rates than average Americans because they earn much of their living through investments and assets (as Buffett put it in a 2011 New York Times column: they ""make money with money""). This distinction comes with a lower tax rate than people who earn their money through wages or salary. At the height of Obama’s Buffett rule campaign in 2012, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center think tank estimated that 217,000 households would have to pay a higher tax rate as a result of the Paying a Fair Share Act. Regardless of the number of those affected, ""did the president propose something that would have approximated a Buffett rule? Yes he did,"" said Roberton Williams, Tax Policy Center fellow. ""It does what the Buffett rule would like to do, (though) it’s not perfect."" Our ruling Gohmert said Obama has ""not proposed one thing that would change"" the fact that Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. In fact, Obama has on multiple occasions proposed changing the tax code so that it complies with the ""Buffett rule,"" which attempts to ensure that high-income people pay a certain percentage of their income in taxes that is at least higher than what middle-class people pay. There’s debate over whether or not this is good policy or how many millionaires would be affected. But that doesn’t change the fact that Obama proposed something that addressed this issue.

New law means taxpayers must back banks' 'incredibly risky' derivatives deals, Rep. Mark Pocan says
","Most of us don't deal in investments known as derivatives, but most of us use banks. That means we should worry about the so-called ""cromnibus bill"" passed recently by Congress, according to U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison. ""Our taxpayer money will back them up on these incredibly risky ventures for the biggest banks out there that do these,"" Pocan said Dec. 17, 2014 on a Madison-area liberal talk show. So, Pocan is claiming that derivatives are ""incredibly risky"" financial ventures. And that the new federal law requires taxpayers to back up banks that lose money on them. ""Cromnibus"" As Pocan indicated, Congress approved a major bill that includes a provision affecting derivatives. The $1.1 trillion measure, signed by President Barack Obama the day before Pocan made his claim, avoided a government shutdown. In the word ""cromnibus,""  the ""cr"" refers to a Continuing Resolution, or a stop-gap spending bill, to keep the Department of Homeland Security operating into February 2015. And omnibus refers to a catchall bill to fund the rest of the government, through September 2015. Derivatives Derivatives, as PolitiFact National has reported, are an unusual kind of an investment whose value depends on an underlying asset. For example: An airline has to buy jet fuel over the coming year to run its planes. If oil prices skyrocket, the airline loses money. So it enters into an agreement that will pay if oil prices increase, lowering its potential for losses. So, derivatives aren’t inherently bad or high-risk. But as the Washington Post’s Wonkblog has observed, before the 2008 financial crisis ""Wall Street firms used more complicated derivative formulas to place risky bets on the mortgage market."" They were at the center of the financial meltdown. The risk The financial crisis led to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. One of its rules requires banks to push some derivatives trading into separate units that do not have access to federal deposit insurance. In other words, banks could continue to hold derivatives, but in special subsidiaries that didn’t benefit from government backing in the form of FDIC insurance. Since Dodd-Frank took effect, banks have sought to change that rule so they can once again use their deposits to underwrite some more complex derivative trades. And the cromnibus bill rolls back that Dodd-Frank provision. The libertarian Reason Foundation worried about the rollback: ""The Dodd-Frank rule prevented traditional banks from betting on financial derivatives with federally insured deposits. The banks could still trade in such exotic securities, but they had to do so with their own capital stock, through non-bank affiliates unsecured by FDIC backing. The idea was to prevent future bailouts like the ones that took place"" in 2008. Two national financial publications, however, saw more of a middle ground. Wall Street banks such as Citicorp and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. were ""thrilled"" with the change made by the cromnibus. But the measure ""doesn’t completely let them off the hook,"" the Wall Street Journal wrote. The change would affect requirements under the Dodd-Frank law that banks spin off certain derivatives-trading activities into units that don’t enjoy access to the government safety net. But the banks would still have to spin off certain riskier derivative transactions ""that helped bring American International Group Inc. to the brink of failure in the 2008 financial crisis."" Similarly, the Fiscal Times concluded that the cromnibus provision does not mean ""that when banks lose money on swaps and derivatives trades, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will have to make them whole. It also doesn’t suggest that, when a bank fails, the taxpayers have to bail out depositors. ""The money the FDIC holds in the Deposit Insurance Fund, and uses to reimburse depositors in failed banks, doesn’t come from taxpayers. It comes from the banks themselves. Secondly, there is no sense in which the FDIC is on the hook to make banks whole if a swaps deal or derivatives trade goes bad. The FDIC insures deposits – hence the name – not the bank itself."" New York University finance professor Stephen Figlewski, founding editor of the Journal of Derivatives, also staked out more of a middle ground in sizing up Pocan’s claim. Only a small number of the derivatives deals could be considered ""incredibly risky,"" he told us, noting that because of other Dodd-Frank provisions, derivatives have become considerably less risky. And while it is true that taxpayers bear some risk, given that the government guarantees banks as a whole, the risk to taxpayers ""is much less than (Pocan) wants you to think,"" Figlewski said. Louisiana State University finance professor Don Chance, the author of two books on derivatives, also told us Pocan’s claim is partly correct but goes too far. Our rating Pocan said that under the federal ""cromnibus"" law, taxpayers must guarantee ""incredibly risky"" derivatives deals made by the nation's largest banks. The federal spending measure does include a provision that makes it easier for banks to use federally insured funds to invest in some investments known as derivatives. But not all derivatives are considered high-risk investments, and there is disagreement over just how much risk the new provision poses for taxpayers. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD7AC00>],/factchecks/2015/jan/07/mark-pocan/new-law-means-taxpayers-must-back-banks-incredibly/

Huckaby on target with stats on skills gap
","State officials are trying to prepare for a time in the near future when it is anticipated that a majority of Georgia jobs will require employees with some college credentials. They’re pushing the state’s technical colleges, colleges and universities to increase the number of degrees and certificates they issue, based largely on two statistics: by 2020, 60 percent of all Georgia jobs will require workers with some college credential; and only 42 percent of young Georgians currently have a college certificate or degree. Hank Huckaby, chancellor of the University System of Georgia, cited those statistics in a December 16th speech to the Valdosta North Rotary Club. Some PolitiFact Georgia readers saw the resulting news accounts and asked us to delve deeper into the statistics. This is a hot topic given that, a decade ago, the United States was the world’s leader in producing college students with bachelor’s degrees — an indicator, analysts say, of long-term economic strength. Today, the U.S. ranks 12th — in the key age range of 25 to 34 — behind nations such as Russia and South Korea. Georgia has based its response to the looming workforce crisis on two major reports. The first was ""Help Wanted,"" a report published in 2010 by Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce. The report forecast that more than 60 percent of jobs nationally, 58 percent in Georgia, will require some form of postsecondary education by 2018. The second report, ""Time is the Enemy,"" from Complete College America, from September 2011http://www.completecollege.org/docs/Time_Is_the_Enemy.pdf, also assessed America’s workforce readiness. It found Georgia with a 27 percent skills gap based on forecasts that 61 percent of the state’s jobs in 2020 would require a career certificate or college degree and, at the time, only 34 percent of Georgia adults had an associate degree or higher. North Carolina and Florida were similar to Georgia. North Carolina was listed in the report with a 27 percent skills gap, Florida with a 28 percent skills gap. So where did the 42 percent statistic for Georgia come from? The University System of Georgia and the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems worked together in Summer 2011 to try to assess how many credentialed adults were in Georgia. They found that 42.4 percent of Georgians, ages 25 to 34 at the time, had college experience -- 20.9 percent had bachelor’s degrees; 8.2 percent had a graduate or professional degree; 6.7 percent had an associate degree; and 6.6 percent had certificates from college programs that were at least one year, but less than two years. The data is from two ""credible authorities,"" the U.S. Census Bureau and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. It is considered ""the most reliable available,"" said Charlie Sutlive, the university system’s spokesman. An update is tentatively set for 2017, which will mark five years since the rollout of the Complete College Georgia initiative at college and university campuses across the state, Sutlive said. In August 2011, Gov. Nathan Deal announced that Georgia was one of 10 states that had been awarded a $1 million grant by the nonprofit Complete College America to significantly increase its college completion rates. The statistics at the time were bleak, given the forecasts for Georgia jobs in the not-too-distant future. Less than 25 percent of full-time students at Georgia’s two-year colleges ever graduate, and only 44 percent of students at the state’s four-year colleges receive their degrees in six years, the governor said. That combination -- unchanged -- would only spell trouble, Deal said. He and others have devised plans to ensure that the state’s colleges, universities and technical are churning out more degrees or certificates. The university system produced about 53,000 degrees a year in 2012, is on target to produce 69,000 degrees a year in 2020 and has a goal of 80,000 a year by 2025, Suitive said. The technical college system has plans for similar year-over-year increases. The University System of Georgia and Technical College System of Georgia have taken several major steps to increase their graduates. For instance, they’ve simplified the enrollment process and now allow credit for 25 courses to transfer between the two systems. Online course offerings also expanded from 1,571 in 2009 to 5,000-plus last fall -- including a new Master’s of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Tech enrolling 1,256 new students. Our conclusion: Georgia’s workforce is facing a skills gap that the University System of Georgia and Technical College System of Georgia are working together to address by pushing for more graduates. The skills gap is significant, though measures of it have varied albeit slightly.

","In December 2014, some Internet users were passing along links to a story with a striking headline: ""Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015."" Here’s the text of the story, originally published at a website called the Daily Leak: One hundred percent of newly elected Republican Senators have agreed to vote to eliminate the food stamps program including; Senators Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), David Perdue (R-Ga.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.). ""Small businesses and the American people cannot afford President Obama’s countless new regulations and tax increases. There is a right way and a wrong to improve our country’s welfare system, and the President’s policies just aren’t working. We need to put poor people first and lower costs,"" Senator Gardner said in a statement. Senator Perdue stated on his campaign website that he was one of the millions of Americans who would support free market solutions to feeding the nation. ""The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is an overreaching federal program that has actually worsened the nutritional standards in this nation and increased costs. I am one of the millions of Americans who wish this program would end. To make matters worse, SNAP benefits are discouraging full-time job creation. We need to repeal the SNAP program and replace it with more affordable free market solutions,"" Perdue said on his campaign page. The Senators signed a pledge to approve any legislation in 2015 that would completely defund the $78 billion program. In recent years, some conservatives have criticized the growing usage of the program, due largely to higher demand during the Great Recession. Still, suggesting it should be eliminated entirely would be a big deal. The food stamp program, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, has a budget of more than $80 billion. So is the story accurate? 'Satire' sites No, it’s not accurate. The Daily Leak is one of a growing number of websites that run ""satire"" -- or more accurately, as we’ve noted, fake news. Sites such as the Daily Currant, the National Report, Empire News and others publish plausible-sounding -- but entirely fabricated -- news articles. Buried on the Daily Leak’s hard-to-find FAQ page is a disclaimer: ""The Daily Leak is a satirical, parody website. … The Daily Leak uses invented names in all its stories, except in cases where public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental."" Interestingly, the quote by Gardner turns out to be rooted in something real -- but the Daily Leak twisted the language from its original purpose. Gardner’s staff pointed us to a news release from when Gardner was serving in the House. It applauded a House vote to approve the Repeal of Obamacare Act, but the Daily Leak changed the news release’s focus from the health care legislation to food stamps by changing the phrase ""health care"" to ""welfare"" and ""patient-centered care"" to putting ""poor people first."" The popular impact What we’ve seen happen is that these posts go viral, free of any ""satire"" label, reaping Web traffic and advertising revenue for the site when people unwittingly share them on social media. This certainly happened with the food stamp story. Through Jan. 6, 2015, when we were researching this fact-check, the Daily Leak story had been shared more than 115,000 times on Facebook alone. These posts likely reached many times that number of eyeballs as friends of these Facebook posters scrolled through their news feeds. And many who saw the story had no inkling it was fake. For instance, the website of the Progressive Democrats of America, a coalition of ""labor, peace, healthcare-for-all, and justice groups"" founded in 2004, re-posted the story without any indication that it was fake. The story was also posted on other political sites, such as Coloradopols.com. When one user at the popular liberal site Democratic Underground posted the Daily Leak item, some commenters warned that it was satire -- but other commenters, even after hearing that, seemed unfazed, saying the Republican Party’s rhetoric on food stamps made it plausible in their mind. ""I totally believe they'd do something like that,"" wrote one user in the Democratic Underground thread. Another wrote, ""If it's satire, it sucked me in completely. I saw nothing that would stretch my credulity."" A third added, ""Even after knowing it's satire, I have a hard time believing it isn't true. These people work tirelessly to cut food stamps. Who is to say they won't try to gut the program?"" In late December, Dave Weigel, a political blogger for Bloomberg, expressed exasperation on his Facebook page with both the fake-news sites and the social-media users who are gullible enough to believe their posts -- or who are too lazy to give them the barest level of scrutiny. ""I first learned of the Daily Leak story when a very smart economist friend -- seriously, he's smart -- emailed it as a shocking story political reporters should have been on,"" Weigel told PolitiFact. ""He didn't mean it as an insult, but increasingly I think reporters should take fake news that way. This story was bogus, but shared more than 100,000 times, while actual stories about Republicans and entitlements that took sourcing and reporting and the support of news organizations can get ignored."" The Daily Leak post, Weigel added, ""was written to be shared by liberals who think conservatives are stupid. In sharing it, they said that they didn't really care whether the bad thing they heard about Republicans was true or not. It's incredible that in the age of Google, so many people decline to take the step of double-checking their sources -- or don't search for better articles."" Our ruling More than 115,000 social media users passed along a story headlined, ""Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015."" But they failed to do due diligence and were snookered, since the story came from a publication that bills itself (quietly) as a ""satirical, parody website."" We rate the claim Pants on Fire. UPDATE, Jan. 8, 2015: After we published our fact-check, we received a response from Kevin Gallagher of the Daily Leak. We had asked him whether he considers the site’s articles to be political satire. Gallagher responded, ""Yes, the site is full of satire, parody, and spoofs, mainly of politics and sports."" When we asked why the site’s satire label is relatively inconspicuous, Gallagher said, ""Are you familiar with The Onion? Let me know when you find their disclaimer. I'll give you a hint, it's hidden deep down in the FAQ. My site has a much more prominent disclaimer than The Onion, National Report, Daily Currant, or most other similar sites, for that matter."" We also asked him his reaction to 110,000-plus people sharing their story on Facebook thinking it was real: ""As a teacher, it would please me greatly to see more people fact-checking what they read on the Internet. Unfortunately, when it comes to politics in particular, people often have an emotional reaction to a headline before using any reason to deduce whether it could possibly be true.""

Did Fox News use wrong picture during Stuart Scott tribute?
","Put this in the category of nipping a rumor in the bud. On Sunday, Jan. 4, ESPN announced that longtime host Stuart Scott died after a long fight with cancer. The website NaHaDaily responded by posting a story that claimed Fox News had botched the photo that accompanied its coverage of Scott’s death. ""Stuart Scott succumbed to cancer at the age of 49 and Fox News television ran a tribute today in his memory, but instead released a picture of ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith,"" NaHaDaily wrote.

Fox News discussed Scott’s passing on air, which included many videos of Scott (and none of Smith). The rumor debunking website Snopes reached the same conclusion previously. NaHaDaily includes a line at the bottom of its Web page, below the comments and copious ads, ""NahaDaily is a daily satirical news source. Meaning complete fiction."" The item clearly misled some readers. On Twitter, users reacted to the fake news. Here’s a sampling: ""@FoxNews SO FOXNEWS IS REALLY SAD AND STUPID."" ""Fox News did Stuart Scott dirty.

Activists say Planned Parenthood, nation's premier abortion provider, thanked Speaker Joe Straus after 2009 session
","
A letter distributed by a conservative group Jan. 4 ticks off reasons it says Texas House Speaker Joe Straus is not ""pro-life,"" ranging from his past authorship of legislation authorizing stem-cell research to his past designation of a former Democratic legislator as chief of staff. 
The letter urges Republican legislators, who will have a 101-vote House majority, to deny the San Antonio Republican a second two-year stint as speaker. Straus drew 70 of 100 GOP member votes in the party's caucus meeting Monday and is expected to prevail today when the post is formally filled by the 150-member body after the session starts Tuesday. 
The Jan. 4 letter, signed by more than 30 anti-abortion activists, floated an unusual warning sign about Straus--involving a thank you. ""Following the 2009 session,"" the letter says, Straus ""was acknowledged and ‘thanked’ for his ‘tireless efforts’ by Planned Parenthood, the nation’s premier abortion provider."" 
Some perspective: Planned Parenthood is a reproductive health care provider with facilities nationwide that offer family-planning services, including abortion. The organization advocates for comprehensive sexual health care and education. 
Carol Everett of Round Rock, a signer of the anti-Straus  letter and founder and CEO of the Heidi Group, a non-profit that has run crisis pregnancy centers in Dallas advising women with unplanned pregnancies about giving birth, told us the reference to Planned Parenthood as the nation’s premier abortion provider reflected on her understanding that its clinics provide more than 300,000 of the nation’s 1.2 million legal abortions a year. She forwarded a 2009 report by an anti-abortion group, the Virginia-based American Life League, terming Planned Parenthood the largest ""abortion chain"" in America with 817 clinics around the country.

According to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health, 1.2 million legal abortions were performed in the United States in 2008. Institute spokeswoman Rebecca Wind told us the institute doesn’t break down which groups provide abortions, but stand-alone clinics provide more abortions than all U.S. Planned Parenthood clinics combined. By our accounting, about 27 percent of abortions in the U.S. are performed at Planned Parenthood clinics versus 73 percent at other medical facilities.

To our inquiry, Tait Sye of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said that in 2008-09, Planned Parenthood provided 328,000 abortions. Sye said in an e-mail: ""Our health centers do much more than provide abortions. They provide a wide range of safe, reliable health care--and more than 90 percent is preventive, primary care, which helps prevent unintended pregnancies through contraception, reduce the spread of sexually transmitted infections through testing and treatment, and screen for cervical and other cancers.""

Straus has been slammed before from the right for links to Planned Parenthood. In the early 1990s, his wife served on the board of San Antonio’s Planned Parenthood affiliate. And in 2008, before Straus was a candidate for speaker, the local group’s political arm contributed $1,000 to Straus’s campaign kitty.

Everett pointed us to an article headlined ""2009 Patron Party"" in the fall 2009 edition of Horizons, the newsletter of the Planned Parenthood Trust of San Antonio and South Central Texas. The article says the Planned Parenthood affiliate’s president and CEO, Jeffrey Hons, thanked three legislators attending the Oct. 6, 2009, gathering at a San Antonio home, plus state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, and Straus, both in absentia, ""for their tireless efforts on behalf of Texas women and children during the last legislative session."" 
Everett said such a mention carries a taint. ""If I got any mention from Planned Parenthood, people would wonder about it,"" Everett said. ""You show one other conservative pro-lifer who has had any mention from Planned Parenthood, I would eat the paper that shows it."" 
In an interview, Yvonne Gutierrez, spokeswoman for the San Antonio Planned Parenthood group, said Hons’ shout-out was not intended to underscore any particular action by Straus. The party was at a home in Straus’ district, Gutierrez said, and Hons ""thanked the speaker because he thought that for his first session (as speaker) he did an excellent job for women and families... It was almost as if how could you be sitting in the speaker’s district talking about the legislative session and not mention the speaker?"" Gutierrez said. The thanks ""was really nothing more than that."" 
The four-paragraph newsletter article focuses on more than 120 individuals whose gifts to the group exceed $1,000 a year. But the story also quotes Mindi Alterman, then the departing board chair, stressing strides the group had made in cervical cancer prevention, testing and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and permanent birth control. 
The 18-page issue opens with a message from Hons describing Planned Parenthood as the city’s most effective teen pregnancy prevention program. ""Finally, and perhaps as a footnote, the people who protest on the sidewalk outside my office window do nothing, absolutely nothing, to prevent so much as one teen pregnancy,"" his message says. ""They do nothing to prevent one abortion while Planned Parenthood prevents thousands of abortions with our family planning clinics. And their protests do nothing to help vulnerable, at-risk teens keep their fragile lives pointed toward a successful adulthood."" 
We asked Tracy Young, Straus’s communications director, for the speaker's take. She made no comment. 
We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDFF200>],/factchecks/2011/jan/11/heidi-group/activists-say-planned-parenthood-nations-premier-a/

Georgia politicos pork out on wild pig to begin each legislative session
","
There are a lot of peculiar political rituals we could talk about here at PolitiFact Georgia. 
But few are more colorful than the pre-legislative feast laid out for the Georgia Legislature every year for the past five decades. It takes place at the old train depot near Underground Atlanta and is attended by hundreds of folks -- lawmakers, the governor, state officials, reporters, lobbyists and just about anybody else who can score a ticket. 
""Since 1962 the Georgia General Assembly has opened its new legislative session each January with the 'Wild Hog Supper,' at which legislators enjoy such state delicacies as barbecued wild pig and Brunswick stew,"" notes the New Georgia Encyclopedia in its extensive entry on hogs in Georgia history.  
No doubt about the Legislature kicking off the year with a ""Wild Hog"" feast. But in an age of  ""cloud computing"" and factory farms, are they REALLY still serving ""wild"" pigs, the intrepid fact-diggers at PolitiFact Georgia wondered? 
To get to the answer, PolitiFact trekked back into the legendary swamps of south-central Georgia.
Bob Addison, who runs Addison Wild Boar Hunting near Abbeville, and whose family and community still supply the victuals for the Wild Hog feast, knows the history as well as anyone. He's lived it most of his life.  
The story begins with Addison's late father, E.C. ""Boo"" Addison, who for most of his 80 years pursued a cunning and dangerous animal that has roamed the wilds of south-central Georgia since the first Europeans arrived. Early settlers brought domestic livestock into the area and often let their hogs and cattle roam free. Some of the pigs became wild, and later were crossbred with a much larger Russian boar to produce the wild hogs that now populate the swamps.  
Back in the late 1950s, ""Boo"" Addison was camping in a Dodge County swamp with Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Phil Campbell and state House Speaker George L. Smith when the idea of a legislative hog supper took root. Thousands of feral hogs still roam those river-bottom woodlands. 
""They got some hogs and they barbecued 'em down in the swamp,"" Bob Addison said. ""George L. said to Phil, 'This is mighty good eatin'. It's a shame the legislators in Atlanta couldn't have a chance to get some of this good food.' And Daddy said, 'I'll furnish the hogs.' Well, they went back to Atlanta and decided that the Sunday before the Legislature opened, they'd have this supper. And it's been happening ever since."" 
Addison said the first supper took place at the Henry Grady Hotel -- since demolished -- and was attended by about 300 people. The event moved to its current location about a decade ago and now attracts more than 1,000 guests. 
Over the years, the Wild Hog Supper came to define the Legislature's return to the Capitol. About 15 years ago, organizers began issuing tickets to control the crowd. ""Busloads of people would pull up, and we had no idea who they were,"" said former Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin. 
One thing that hasn't changed much over the years is the entree. 
The hogs that end up on dinner plates begin life in litters of up to 14 born deep in the dark undergrowth of Addison's swamp. Coyotes and other predators quickly thin their ranks.  
The hogs that survive eat just about anything that won't eat them -- acorns, roots, even snakes and small animals. Addison supplements their diet with grain, peanut shells and barrels of discarded candy from a nearby factory.  
The male hogs, the boars, are the wildest. They average 250 pounds but can tip the scales at 600. Their razor-sharp tusk can rip a man or dog to shreds. 
""No matter how young they are, boars have a strong taste,"" said Bob Addison's wife, Jo Ann. ""We don't use boars for the Wild Hog Supper."" 
The Addisons use only sweeter-tasting female hogs for the legislative shindig. The hogs -- very wild indeed as it turns out --  are captured in large ""Jurassic Park""-looking cages several weeks before the supper. They are penned up and fattened on grain before they are slaughtered. 
""It sort of tenders them up a bit,"" said Jo Ann Addison.  
She said they used 20 wild hogs for this year's supper, which attracted a packed house even as a major snow and ice storm moved into metro Atlanta.  
It turns out the hogs at the 49th annual Wild Hog Supper were indeed wild -- these critters never see a pen until they are captured. We rate this one True.  
And in case you're still reading, we're including a bonus. Below you will find Bob Addison's recipe for cooking a wild hog -- just in case you ever need it: 
Prepare oak coals two hours before cooking begins in the evening. Allow the coals to form a thin dusting of ash. Place the hog carcasses on metal racks 18 inches above the coals in special covered pits in the ground. Put the skin side up. Keep the pit temperature about 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Cook for eight hours. Just after sunrise, turn the meat. ""That boils the grease back up through the meat as a natural tenderizer.""  Cook for a few more hours until the ribs separate from the meat. Total cooking time --- 12 hours. Serve with barbecue sauce and enjoy.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8D90C0>],/factchecks/2011/jan/11/new-georgia-encyclopedia/georgia-politicos-pork-out-wild-pig-begin-each-leg/

Arizona shooting prompts questions about civility in politics, with a focus on Florida
","
The tragic shooting of Democratic Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords on Jan. 8, 2011, at a Tucson constituent event is prompting some elected officials, members of the media and everyday citizens to re-evaluate whether American politics has become too filled with vitriol, anger and hate-filled speech.

While the motives of the gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, remain unclear, many have used the shooting to push for restoring civility to the political process.

Yet others already have engaged in a game of subtle finger pointing.

Some liberals have blamed overheated Tea Party rhetoric for contributing to today's political climate. Conservatives, meanwhile, have noted that some Democrats are no better, and that Loughner was disturbed beyond the bounds of either political party. Others also have singled out the media for covering the extremes of the political debate. Pima County Sheriff Clarence W. Dupnik lectured the media at a Jan. 8 news conference, saying that trying ""to inflame the public on a daily basis, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, has impact on people, especially who are unbalanced personalities to begin with.""

On NBC's Meet the Press on Jan. 9, 2011, five members of the U.S. House talked about the shooting, the political climate and the security of members of Congress.

The panel included Republican Trent Franks of Arizona, Democrat Raul M. Grijalva of Arizona, Democrat Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, Republican Raul Labrador of Idaho and Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.

The discussion was at times emotional, and Meet the Press moderator David Gregory began to choke up when he talked about one of the shooting victims, a nine-year-old girl who was elected to her student council.

Gregory then talked about the demonization of the political opposition -- ""whether it's a congressman saying, 'You lie,' from the House floor, whether it's a Democrat who literally shoots the cap and trade bill in a campaign advertisement. Or your former colleague, Alan Grayson from Florida, compared Republicans to the Taliban.""

""I think we're a country that tries to solve our problems by ballots and not bullets, so a good debate is fine,"" answered Franks. ""But when you try to go into an area of threatening debate and things of that nature, then it's very dangerous.""

Wasserman Schultz picked up on Franks' ""ballots and not bullets"" reference when it was her turn to speak.

""Just based on what Trent just said and what, what everyone has said, I agree, it's our responsibility to make sure that we set the right example and set the tone of civility,"" she said. ""But the shock-jocks and the political movement leaders that are out there on both sides of the aisle need to ... have some pause as well.

""I mean, the phrase that you just used, 'we use ballots, not bullets,' the actual reverse of that phrase was used in my district by someone who was almost the chief of staff to an incoming member of Congress where she said at a rally, at a Tea Party rally, 'We will use bullets if ballots don't work.' ""

It's a provocative claim made by Wasserman Schultz, and we wondered if it was true.

Turns out, we've covered some of this ground.

Wasserman Schultz is referring to Joyce Kaufman, an outspoken South Florida conservative radio talk show host on WFTL-850 AM, who garnered national attention after newly elected U.S. Rep. Allen West hired her as his chief of staff a week after the Nov. 2, 2010, election. She resigned from that position days later amid controversy, and after someone sent a threat to her that stated: ""I'm planning something big around the government building here in Broward County, maybe a post office, maybe even a school. ..."" The threat led to a lockdown of Broward schools Nov. 10 and an FBI investigation.

At a political rally on July 3, 2010, Kaufman addressed a Broward County crowd about the need to change the culture in Washington by electing new members to the House and Senate. Her entire speech has been posted on YouTube and is about 10 minutes long. You can watch her speech here.

A few of our notes after watching the entire speech: Kaufman suggested that, without a changing of the guard in Washington, people could be banned from street corners and that ""there would be kill switches on the Internet."" She told the crowd to put the brakes on this ""insanity"" that's been happening, and to get rid of ""these people in Washington who have no integrity."" Kaufman said the 2010 election was the most important one in ""our lifetime,"" and that she says ""what I mean, and I mean what I say.""

She then talked about the Founding Fathers and how brilliant they were.

""They gave us ballots,"" she said a little more than 5 minutes into her speech. ""That is the first line of defense ... We send home all of these incumbents who have done nothing to represent the people. They don't come to their districts. They don't talk to us.

""And then the Founding Fathers were ever so brilliant -- and I don't care how this gets painted by the mainstream media, I don't care if this shows up on YouTube -- because I am convinced that the most important thing the Founding Fathers did to ensure me my First Amendment rights is they gave me a Second Amendment,"" Kaufman said, referring to the constitutional amendment that speaks of gun rights.

""And if ballots don't work, bullets will,"" Kaufman said, as people in the crowd reacted by clapping. One person is heard saying ""Absolutely,"" and another says ""Amen.""

""I never in my life thought that the day would come where I would tell individual citizens that you are responsible for being the militia that the Founding Fathers designed,"" she said. ""They were very specific. You need to be prepared to fight tyranny, whether it comes from outside, or whether it comes from inside.""

Months after the comments, Kaufman tried to suggest they were meant as a metaphor, and told PolitiFact Florida that: ""My goal certainly wasn't to incite violence. .... I was encouraging people to go out and use their vote."" PolitiFact Florida ruled True a claim from Kaufman that President Barack Obama said in a political context during the 2008 campaign that ""If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun."" The line was a quote from the 1987 movie The Untouchables.

(For the record, Kaufman gave her speech at the corner of Oakland Park Boulevard and North Federal Highway in Fort Lauderdale, which is near a shopping center in West's District 22, not Wasserman Schultz's District 20. Wasserman Schultz's district is less than 10 blocks away).

Calling for less heated political rhetoric in the wake of the shooting of an Arizona congresswoman, Wasserman Schultz noted on NBC's Meet the Press that the person hired to be chief of staff for an elected Florida congressman told people at a rally that if ballots can't enact political change, ""bullets will.""

Wasserman Schultz is quoting Kaufman accurately. (Kaufman said, ""If ballots don't work, bullets will."")

Maybe we could all do better by leaving the war and gun language out of political discussions. As NBC News' Chuck Todd put it, ""To political professionals, the use of these images has no impact; the problem is when these images are digested by those who are already a bit unstable. No one is calling for censorship, only responsibility.""

Tim Kaine says Obama's approval ratings ""fine"" compared to other presidents
","
With Democrats woozy from their shellacking in November’s congressional elections, political junkies are riveted on 2012 and whether President Barack Obama will win a second term.

No one is putting a better spin on Obama’s fortunes than Tim Kaine, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He wrote an end-of-the year column for Politico, a Washington news organization, saying Obama’s ""list of achievements already dwarfs that of many presidents.""

Kaine, a former Virginia governor, encountered skepticism during a TV interview last Sunday. Ed Henry, CNN’s senior White House corespondent, noted Obama’s approval rating from voters dropped 6 percentage points in 2010.

""You made your case but it seems like the American people aren’t buying it, sir,"" Henry said.

Kaine replied, ""Relatively, if you look at the president’s mid-term numbers compared to other presidents in their mid-term, he’s fine.""

We decided to take a closer look. Kaine was responding to a Gallup poll conducted in the final week of December that showed 47 percent of adult Americans approved of Obama’s job performance, 45 percent disapproved and 8 percent were undecided.

First, we asked for clarification of what Kaine meant when he said Obama is ""fine.""

Alec Gerlach, a DNC press secretary, said Kaine meant Obama’s mid-term poll numbers ""are in the neighborhood of other presidents who got re-elected, including Reagan and Clinton."" So for this fact-check we will focus on whether Obama's ratings are indeed similar to presidents who got re-elected.

Then we researched polls by Gallup because it has the longest record of tracking presidential popularity, dating to 1937 when Franklin Roosevelt was beginning his second term. We compared Obama’s numbers to the approval ratings other presidents received at the start of the year after mid-term congressional elections.

To keep the comparison consistent, we turned to the first Gallup poll on Obama completely conducted in 2011. A survey from Jan. 2 to Jan. 4 found the president had 49 percent approval, 45 percent disapproval and 6 percent were undecided on his job perfromance.

The average mid-term mark for presidents -- from Roosevelt in 1939 through Obama in 2011 -- is 53.5 percent approval, 36 percent disapproval and 10.5 percent undecided. Obama seems to be in the neighborhood, but not on the best street.

Let’s look at the presidents who got reelected in that time span. Their average mid-term approval was 57 percent and disapproval was 35 percent. Obama is not in that school district. But neither were Ronald Reagan nor Bill Clinton midway through their first terms. Then they moved up quickly.

Reagan was the least popular mid-term president. At the start of 1983, with the nation emerging from recession, he had 37 percent approval and 54 percent disapproval. Less than two years later, Reagan carried all but one state in a landslide reelection.

Bill Clinton’s numbers at the start of 1995 were similar to Obama’s today. Clinton had 47 percent approval, 45 percent disapproval. In 1996, he was easily reelected.

In contrast, George H.W. Bush had a robust 59 percent approval rating in early 1991 only to lose reelection the next year.

All told, we were able to find the last 19 mid-term presidential polls by Gallup. Obama’s approval rating is the 11th highest. Of the eight presidents below him, four times their party retained the White House in the next election, and four times it didn’t.

Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, says mid-term polls are a horrible gauge of coming elections because a president’s popularity can soar or plummet with events.

""They don’t say a thing,"" he said. ""The numbers that matter are the votes of people and, considering the beating Democrats took on Nov. 7, the president is by no means OK, assured of a successful term or a second one.""

Let’s review.

Kaine, with his spokesman’s elaboration, said Obama’s mid-term polling popularity is ""fine"" compared to other presidents who went on to re-election.

Kaine is correct in saying that Obama’s numbers compare favorably to Reagan and Clinton. But the president’s mid-term approval rating -- gauged by the first poll completely conducted in the new mid-term year -- is 8 percentage points below the average of re-elected presidents since 1939. His disapproval rating is 10 percentage points above the average.

We know those numbers can change in an instant. But when a politician is down by 8 or 10 percentage points, we say he’s behind but within striking distance.

We rate Kaine’s statement Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE6E7C0>],/factchecks/2011/jan/10/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-obamas-approval-ratings-fine-compar/

When Milwaukee County Board Chairman Lee Holloway took office as acting county executive Dec. 28, 2010, he laid out his vision for the county before a crowd of more than 250 people at a Courthouse swearing-in ceremony.

Amid the vision, he made passing reference to his notoriety as a city landlord.

Earlier in December, Holloway was ordered into court -- again -- for not correcting building code violations on five apartment buildings he owns with his wife, Lynda, on W. Atkinson Ave. Holloway had been cited for 116 violations ranging from rodent and roach infestations to loose window trim and moldy walls, according to city officials and inspection records.

Some of the violations have been fixed. According to a Dec. 2, 2010 Journal Sentinel article only 63 of the 116 violations were part of the case sent to court. And inspection notes indicated some of the remaining 63 already had been addressed.

The violations date back to 2009, and have been subject to monthly re-inspections -- many at a cost of $350 per visit. His problems with code violations stretch back years, according to city records and news reports.

In his swearing-in speech, Holloway didn’t say much about his violations, but took this unscripted swipe at City Hall: ""We know that the city uses the building inspection area as a revenue base.""

Is Holloway right on that point? Is the city raking in building inspection fees to help balance the budget?

We called Holloway spokesman Harold Mester to ask what the acting executive -- and candidate for the full-time job in the April election -- was basing his statement on.

Mester responded that Holloway might talk -- if we first made some calls. He said we should contact Crown Hardware, Door City and Home Depot and find out what their customers said about building inspection fees.

We tried, but the responses led to unlisted phone numbers and shrugs as to why Holloway wanted a reporter to contact the business.

Mester then told us Holloway was not willing to discuss his comments further.

He did tell us Holloway received advice and data about the city’s building inspection department from another landlord -- and occasional political foe -- Orville Seymer, a founder of the Citizens for Responsible Government.

After hearing about Holloway’s latest court date last month, Seymer said he called Holloway and ""invited myself"" to meet Holloway at the apartments for a visit from city inspectors.

""I don’t think that Lee Holloway is the problem here,"" said Seymer. ""I think it’s the Department of Neighborhood Services. They’re out to get Holloway and they’re out to get landlords in general.""

Seymer said he shared with Holloway budget data that he has collected that he argues shows building inspectors are padding city coffers.

He prepared a spreadsheet showing the growth in recent years in ""special charges"" on the city tax rolls -- money added to property tax bills that is owed to the city for services provided.

Those numbers are growing, according to the city. Those ""special charges"" were $6.9 million in 2010, compared with $4 million in 2006.  

But those charges take in much more than building inspection fees. They also include boarded-up buildings, abandoned cars, litter and snow and ice removal.

What’s more, city officials say the increases have come as a tidal wave of foreclosed properties have hit the city -- and as the city has taken numerous steps to keep those buildings from falling into disrepair. Last year there were 6,427 foreclosures in Milwaukee County, and the vast majority of those were in the city of Milwaukee.

For instance: Records show that last year the city had nearly four times as many properties that needed boarding up and spent about twice as much on litter removal compared with five years ago.

So, what about the fees Holloway is being charged to cover inspections of his properties?

In 2010, the city collected about $4 million in fees for re-inspections of 5,939 properties. That compares with $2.53 million for 6,091 properties in 2006.

The amount taken in was up, officials said, because the city increased re-inspection fees for property owners who received repeated visits. The fees increase from $50 to $350 for the fourth visit -- viewed as an added incentive for landlords to make repairs in a timely fashion.

City Budget Director Mark Nicolini said the fees help fund the operation of the city’s Department of Neighborhood Services. That department had a $14 million budget for 2010, with that amount being paid by various fees generated by department services.

Under state law, the city cannot use fees to cover anything more than the service provided.

""These aren’t additional revenues,"" said Nicolini. ""We can’t use them to go fund garbage collection.""

Patrick Curley, chief of staff to Mayor Tom Barrett, was even stronger on this point.

""Mr. Holloway does not have the facts on the city budget,"" Curley said. ""Mr. Holloway is dead wrong.""

OK, we’ve finished our inspection of Holloway’s building inspection statement. No charge.

Holloway, who is due in court Jan. 27, 2011, for the building inspection fees, said the city is using such charges to balance its budget. The city has had more re-inspections and other unpaid charges in recent years. But there’s no evidence that the city uses them as a revenue source or to otherwise pad the budget -- indeed, it’s against state law to use fees for anything beyond paying for the service provided.

We’ll add this to that summation: False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC67C900>],/factchecks/2011/jan/10/lee-holloway/acting-milwaukee-county-executive-lee-holloway-acc/
"['Bipartisanship', 'Texas', 'Allan Ritter']","
Party-switching legislator Allan Ritter says his district was Democratic blue, but now it's Republican red
","
Democrat-turned-Republican state Rep. Allan Ritter told reporters last month that the district he represents once was true blue, but it’s now dead red.

Ritter was less, uh, poetical at a Dec. 14 Austin press conference confirming his switch, which helped Republicans edge toward the 101-vote Texas House super-majority they’ll have when the 2011 legislative session starts Tuesday.

""In my 12 years in the House, I have watched my district go from a solidly Democratic district to a heavily Republican district,"" the Nederland resident said of House District 21, which takes in a portion of Beaumont and extends through southwestern Jefferson County. His comment appeared in a Dec. 15 Dallas Morning News article.

Did most voters in Ritter’s district shift right in that time?

To gauge election returns, we contacted the Texas Legislative Council, which provided results of various general-election races for Ritter’s district from 1994, four years before he first won his seat, through 2008; analyst Clare Dyer told us the council has yet to analyze 2010 results within the district. We also asked Jefferson County for breakdowns of district results.

What we found is that Republicans running statewide were strong vote-getters prior to Ritter’s election, a sign the Dems’ grip on the district was already loosening.  Still, Democrats continued to win a share of down-ballot races, though that pattern has faded.

Also notable: Jefferson County, historically pro-union, pro-Democratic territory, saw numerous down-ballot races in which the GOP offered no nominees. Also, the district’s configuration changed slightly in redistricting after the 2000 census. We scrutinized district results based on boundaries in place at the time of each election.

Some particulars:

+In November 1994, seven Republicans running statewide carried the district, topped by U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison with 61 percent. But seven Democratic statewide hopefuls also prevailed, led by Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock at 65 percent.

+In 1998, Ritter drew 53 percent of the district’s vote, while Democratic state Sen. David Bernsen of Beaumont won 61 percent; U.S. Rep. Nick Lampson fared the best of Democrats in races analyzed by the council, gathering 68 percent.

No Democrats won statewide office that year, but five nominees carried HD 21 including two judicial choices and Jim Mattox (for attorney general), 54 percent; John Sharp (lieutenant governor), 53 percent; and Paul Hobby (state comptroller), 52 percent.

Eight Republican hopefuls including four judicial nominees won the district, topped by Gov. George W. Bush, at 68 percent.

According to Jefferson County, a Democrat carried part of HD 21 in 1998 for a county commissioner’s seat, while a Republican seeking another commissioner seat carried a different part. Among HD 21 voters, Republican Jimmy D. ""Skip"" Hulett bested his Democratic opponent for a district court judgeship, though Hulett lost his race over all.

+In 2000, Ritter won 57 percent of the district vote, compared to Lampson’s 63 percent. Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison got 66 percent with Bush, the GOP presidential nominee, drawing 62 percent.

+In 2002, Ritter romped with 70 percent as Lampson garnered 66 percent in the district. However, every Republican running statewide--with the leading vote-getter being State Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander, 64 percent--carried the district.

From 2004 through 2010, Ritter ran unopposed in November elections as Republicans running for state and federal office enjoyed continued gains:

+In 2004, Bush won 63 percent in the district as Democrat Lampson got 59 percent though he lost his seat to a Republican challenger in a district that had been redrawn by the GOP-majority 2003 Legislature.

+In 2006, every Republican running statewide carried the district, led by Hutchison, who drew 65 percent. At the bottom of the statewide slate was Perry, who got 45 percent of the district vote versus three major foes. Down-ballot, the Democratic nominees for Jefferson County judge, Ronald Walker, and the 279th state district judgeship, Randy Shelton, drew 52 and 51 percent, respectively.

+In 2008, Republican presidential nominee John McCain drew 66 percent of the vote, while Cornyn carried 64 percent, compared to 55 percent statewide for both. In contested statewide races, no Republican carried less than 56 percent of the district vote.

+In November 2010, Republicans beat Democrats in the district for three Texas Supreme Court seats, a seat on the state’s highest criminal court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, and a spot on the Ninth Court of Appeals. Down ballot, Republican hopefuls for county treasurer and tax assessor-collector trounced their Democratic foes--also prevailing countywide in the historically Democratic bastion.

To our queries, partisan consultants Mike Baselice and Ed Martin said the district leans Republican, but Martin, a Democratic strategist, said it hasn't changed as much as Ritter claims.

Baselice, a GOP pollster, stressed numbers that he said demonstrate the district shifting 10 percentage points over 10 years. In 1998, the base Republican vote in the district was 47 percent, he said, a figure based on entwining the results of races for lieutenant governor and state comptroller (and ignoring third-party votes). In 2008, the base GOP vote was 57 percent, based on the results in one race for the Texas Supreme Court.

In an interview, Ritter told us voter perceptions have swung. ""I can’t say that a Democrat, the right candidate, cannot win in the district... My point is that the overall view and philosophical view and the comfortability of the voters, they are leaning heavy conservative and Republican. I can tell you, just from the reaction we’ve been getting locally that’s overwhelmingly supportive of (my switch), I know this is the right move.""

Finally, Bruce Drury, a retired Lamar University professor of political scientist, cautioned against basing conclusions about the district’s tilt on the latest elections, which were widely viewed as a referendum on national affairs and the Democratic leadership in Washington. Drury said: ""If the Republicans screw up Congress and (the) 2012 (election) becomes a plebiscite on that and (President Barack) Obama appears to be successful, then Allan Ritter could well be in trouble.""

Our sense? Republicans running statewide had an edge in Ritter’s district before his first election and that advantage expanded in subsequent elections as Democrats became less successful. During the 12 years, though, Democrats still pulled off some wins, while a few candidates (like Ritter) managed not to stir up GOP challengers. Whether such free rides will continue is uncertain.

Rittter exaggerates how ""solidly Democratic"" his district was; he’s closer to the mark on how Republican it became. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB70140>],/factchecks/2011/jan/10/allan-ritter/party-switching-legislator-allan-ritter-says-his-d/
"['Ohio', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'John Boehner']","
House Speaker John Boehner has the right count on the magnitude of the federal debt
","
Republicans like to say the government is spending like a drunken sailor. Democrats say the government needs to keep spending, albeit strategically, to jolt job creation. It’s all relative to political persuasion and the economic theories that partisans follow.

But congressman John Boehner, a southwestern Ohio Republican who just became speaker of the House of Representatives, provides a perspective that Americans outside of Washington  might not think about.

""Our spending has caught up with us, and our debt soon will eclipse the entire size of our national economy,"" Boehner said in his inaugural remarks upon accepting the speaker’s gavel. ""Hard work and tough decisions will be required of the 112th Congress.""

There are certain assumptions built into this claim about the extent of the government’s debt, although they are widely held and agreed to by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and President Barack Obama’s commission on reducing the deficit and debt. But before going there, we thought we’d look at Boehner’s statement in its most simplistic interpretation.

The United States government’s total debt on the day Boehner took over as speaker was $14 trillion, according to the Treasury Department’s interactive ""Debt to the Penny"" website.

The size of the United States economy, measured by the gross domestic product, or the value of all goods and services, was $14.745 trillion in the third quarter of 2010, the most recent quarter for which data is available. This number comes from the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis databases.

Using only these numbers, it would appear that the eclipse is about to start. But since GDP estimates are not as current as the debt numbers, we wanted to see how big the debt was at the  end of the third quarter of 2010. Going back to Treasury’s calculator, we got a debt figure of $13.668 trillion by putting the date at Oct. 31, 2010. Boehner said ""soon,"" so he was correct: $13.6 trillion in debt against a $14.7 trillion economy signals the onset of an eclipse.

Economists and analysts who are reading this by now are shouting, ""Wait!"" We understand.  Some government debt is considered way more troubling than other, and many analysts say that only part of it should be used when measuring its size against the total economy.

A mercifully short primer: Federal debt has two major components, namely, debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings. Public debt is money the government owes to the public, including foreigners who buy government T bills and retirees who want safe government bonds.  The government sells them these bills and bonds and uses the money to operate. But like a loan, the money must be paid back in real cash.

Intragovernmental holdings involve such things as Social Security Trust Fund IOU’s and other transfers between divisions of the government. These borrowings must be repaid, too, but they don’t put an immediate crimp on the government, and they often are handled by shuffling paper back and forth between departments, despite the future perils that may hold (the piper must be paid eventually, and all that).

In other words, the public debt will require real money to repay the lenders, and that has a faster ripple effect in the private sector. So we go back to that Treasury calculator to see how much money this might involve. It shows that the public debt on the day that Boehner took control of the House was nearly $9.4 trillion. It was $9.069 trillion as of the end of last October, when the GDP was $14.745 trillion, or nearly 62 percent of the GDP.

That’s a high debt-to-GDP ratio by historic standards, although it was much higher at the end of World War II, when the debt did in fact exceed the nation’s GDP. But what worries Boehner and many others is the projection that the public debt could reach World War II proportions again.

If current practices aren’t changed, debt will reach 90 percent of GDP in 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office, whose figures were cited by President Barack Obama’s national Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in December.

Brian Riedl, a research fellow at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation, told us the public debt could reach 100 percent of GDP by then, ""and if you add in state and local debt, it could be as early as 2016, 2017 or 2018.""

And if this trend were to continue? Unless Congress made some big changes, ""the federal debt would balloon to 185 percent of GDP by 2035,"" said the CBO. The president’s commission used the same warning.

Would this automatically be catastrophic? That depends on the government’s choices. For a parallel, consider the mortgage on a house, which often exceeds the owner’s income by 200 percent or 300 percent. The problem is that if there are other debts and the car breaks down and Junior suddenly needs braces, the homeowner is likely to have a problem that limits his financial and lifestyle options.

For the government, this would likely drive up interest rates as the government competed with the private sector to borrow money, and crimp economic growth. It could result in tax hikes, spending cuts and stingier government entitlements, analysts say..

It needs to be noted that these projections are based on the most dire projections that use a set of what-ifs, and rosier estimates show up, in fact, in current budget documents. But the what-ifs come from realistic expectations about the way Washington operates. For example, the CBO noted that Congress passed tax cuts a decade ago and projected they would only last a decade. Yet Congress just renewed them.

Similarly, Congress keeps passing temporary, one-year payment hikes for Medicare doctors who otherwise would see steep cuts -- and might stop caring for seniors. While well-intentioned, this keeps the long-term costs from looking too bad when projecting future budgets, despite the fact that renewal is a near certainty every single year. The CBO doesn’t say this is nefarious; it just says that continuation of these kinds of practices has consequences.

So what of Boehner’s claim that the debt will ""soon"" eclipse the size of the economy? 
We are not endorsing or rejecting Boehner’s proposed solutions or his analysis of the policies that led to the problem. Democrats blame the war in Iraq and the tax cuts of former President George W. Bush, while Republicans blame spending by Democrats and President Barack Obama’s White House. Some economists suggest that with sensible policy changes and an economy that eventually turns robust, these fears will never come to pass.

But when the nonpartisan CBO and the Democratic president’s fiscal commission agree with the Republican leader on the scope of the problem, both citing the prospect public debt at 185 percent of GDP, the Truth-O-Meter must concur that his prediction is reasonable.

So we rate Boehner’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE81680>],/factchecks/2011/jan/10/john-boehner/house-speaker-john-boehner-has-right-count-magnitu/
"['Legal Issues', 'Small Business', 'Wisconsin', 'National Federation of Independent Business-Wisconsin']","
National Federation of Independent Business says Wisconsin’s lawsuit rules are among the most anti-business in the nation
","
The business community’s years-long drive for tighter limits on injury-liability lawsuits got a huge boost when Republicans took control of state government in January 2011.

Even though Gov. Scott Walker immediately proposed a list of business-backed legal changes, business leaders began mobilizing to respond to trial lawyers’ attempts to cast the initiatives as anti-consumer.

The Wisconsin chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business portrayed mom-and-pop companies as easy prey when people sue over harm from defective products, negligent care, accidents and other injuries.

""Wisconsin has one of the most promiscuous tort systems in the country in which small businesses are easy targets for baseless lawsuits and civil penalties that are entirely disproportionate,"" said Bill Smith, state director of the group, in a Jan. 4 news release in support of Walker’s proposals:

The release added, ""The impact of a single lawsuit on small business can be devastating.""

The other side -- plaintiff’s trial lawyers in a lobbying coalition known as the Wisconsin Association for Justice -- say the reforms will devastate some victims.

In this item, we’re not sorting out the policy implications of the proposed changes. We’re looking at whether -- as Smith said on behalf of the group claims -- Wisconsin is on the extreme edge in terms of being a pro-plaintiff state in injury cases.

Smith pointed to a 2010 Pacific Research Institute ranking of states that he said puts Wisconsin at 35th -- or 16th-worst in the United States -- for an anti-business lawsuit climate. The institute is a free-market think tank based in California.

He also pointed us to Andrew Cook, a lawyer working with the Wisconsin Civil Justice Council, a business coalition lobbying for tighter lawsuit controls.

The two noted three areas of liability law where they say Wisconsin court rulings have put the state out of the mainstream.

One involves a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that allowed a Milwaukee lead-paint lawsuit even though no single specific manufacturer could be tied to the paint. Cook noted that a leading expert, University of Maryland law professor Donald Gifford, said that put Wisconsin alone among states.

A second is product liability, in which Wisconsin is one of just four states that continue to rely on a legal standard that critics say makes it too hard for manufacturers to defend themselves.

The third involves expert testimony in complex cases. Wisconsin is one of 14 states that have rejected tougher requirements for scientific proof of experts’ opinions, as set out in a 1993 U.S. Supreme Court case.

Of course, Smith did not quote any of those individually. He made a more sweeping statement.

Let’s weigh the evidence.

The Pacific Research Institute study cited by Smith is widely quoted but comes with an agenda: the group is openly in favor of tighter controls on lawsuits.

That doesn’t make it a bad study, but there’s a much bigger issue with Smith’s use of it as a defense: The study actually rates Wisconsin as among the best in the country for its lawsuit climate from a business standpoint -- ninth among states.

The No. 35 ranking -- cited by Smith -- was mentioned in the study.

But that ranking judged the set of laws and rules on each state’s books, not the actual outcome in terms of volume of lawsuits, damage awards and settlements. The group’s study makes clear that the information on the state of the law can’t be used as a precise measure or comparison.

The study bases its state-by-state rankings on results -- and Wisconsin was No. 9 on that score.

Leading the pack was Alaska. In the study’s foreword, then-Gov. Sarah Palin says said ""we practice the rule of law, not the rule of lawyers as in other states.""

The study credited Wisconsin with having very low losses in auto, medical malpractice and commercial cases. It said the risk of litigation here was 10th-lowest in the country.

It said the state has no ""judicial hellholes,"" which it defined as places where the courts are sought out by personal injury lawyers because they are so friendly to plaintiffs.

That’s a far cry from how Smith portrayed it on behalf of his group.

So, according to the study: Wisconsin has comparatively anti-business laws and rules on going to court, but it does not produce much for plaintiffs when they get there.

How can that be?

Daniel Rottier, a Wisconsin personal-injury lawyer with national experience, says the answer lies in the conservative nature of Wisconsinites. He says they are less inclined to hit companies with big damages than jurors in many other states.

The only other national study mentioned by either side is done by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In that study, Wisconsin’s lawsuit system, from the business perspective, ranked 22nd last year and between 10th and 24th in seven previous years, based on a survey of corporate lawyers. A  No. 1 ranking meant most business friendly.

That puts Wisconsin in the middle of the pack.

Beyond the rankings, Smith and Cook cited specific types of cases where the state’s highest court has taken a liberal tack on some specific areas of liability law.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court’s ruling on lead-paint manufacturer’s liability was unprecedented. And we are in the minority of states in how we approach product liability and expert testimony. Whether the proposed changes will have much impact on those areas is a hotly debated point.

""They are out of whack,"" said Brooklyn Law School Professor Aaron Twerski, an author of product-liability standards adopted in whole or in part by most states but not Wisconsin. ""It’s makes it too hard for defendants.""

Wisconsin Supreme Court justices are divided on adopting the more-popular new standard, a review of relevant rulings found.

But we are not divided on judging NFIB-Wisconsin’s statement.

In making the case for the Walker-proposed reforms, the group says the state has one of the ""most promiscuous"" legal climates in the country. Smith, the group’s state director, cites some individual points, including the lead paint ruling, where Wisconsin stands out. But the larger study he cites undercuts his own main point.

It shows that Wisconsin -- based on 42 separate measures -- is actually among the best for business, not the worst when it comes to outcomes. The only other study cited in the debate, by the obviously pro-business U.S. Chamber of Commerce, had Wisconsin squarely in the middle of the pack.

The verdict is in. We rate the group’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA2B140>],/factchecks/2011/jan/09/national-federation-independent-business-wiscons/national-federation-independent-business-says-wisc/

Victoria Taft says city spent nearly $1 million on redundant bike signs
","
  
CORRECTION: CORRECTION: This item was corrected to reflect that there are new bikeway sharrows near older medallion bikeway marks on Northwest Johnson Street. Our ruling did not change. 
The city of Portland made national headlines last month by landing in a year-end report of government waste, as compiled by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. 
His ""Wastebook 2010"" lists some laugh-out-loud examples of federal largess: $2.5 million on a Census Bureau commercial too ironic to be understood? More than $200,000 to study why political candidates make vague statements? Nearly $500,000 to maintain a lavish office for former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert? (We’re not vouching for the accuracy of any of those statements.)

But we’re pretty sure that entry No. 100 -- out of 100 -- did not make anyone at the Portland Bureau of Transportation chuckle.

""Why have one bike sign when you can have two?"" reads the final entry from Coburn’s report. ""Oregon spent $900,000 in federal stimulus funds on a new bike signage project even though the city already has similar bike signs, which it plans to leave up. ‘The new signs — which include arrows, distance, and travel times to key destinations — have a slightly different design than existing ones,’ according to a local biking website.""

With the entry, Coburn posted photos of the old and new bike signs, as snapped by Jonathan Maus of bikeportland.org, also known as the ""local biking website."" The roadside signs in the photos are at two different locations and look a little different from each other.

Coburn’s clear implication is that the city doubled up on redundant signage. Local talk radio host Victoria Taft picked up on his theme on her blog:

""Portland spent nearly $1,000,000.00 in federal ’stimulus’ money to install ‘bike path’ signs where they already existed.""

With her blog, Taft includes a photo of a ""sharrow"" mark, a white sign marked on the pavement to indicate a bike boulevard. The implication here is that the ""sharrows"" are redundant.

PolitiFact Oregon wanted to know: Did Portland spend money for signs when there were already perfectly good signs in place? We asked the city for clarification.

In 2009, Portland received $900,000 from President Barack Obama’s ""America Recovery and Reinvestment Act"" -- the stimulus -- to improve bicycle signage.

About $69,000 of that money went for 450 new ""wayfinding"" signs, the ones singled out by Coburn as wasteful. (These are green and white signs alongside the road telling riders the distance and estimated time to get to Lloyd Center or to the Eastbank Esplanade or myriad other destinations.) The $69,000 also paid for 1,180 new yellow ""safety"" signs marking crosswalks for pedestrians and cyclists. In any case, $69,000 is a pretty small portion of the overall grant.

What about the rest of the money? About $480,000 of the $900,000 was spent on the ""sharrow"" pavement markings snapped by Taft. The city used the federal grant to paint 2,100 federally approved sharrows to mark 23 miles of new bike boulevards, and 30 miles of existing bike boulevards. The existing bike boulevards were stamped with smaller circles, and those are still there. The sharrows are larger, about 3 feet by 9 feet, and give a uniform look to all bike boulevards.

(That leaves $351,000 unaccounted for. Where did that go? Well, said Dan Anderson, spokesman for the transportation bureau, there’s overhead, engineering costs, project management costs, contractor compliance costs, and pollution and erosion control costs. So many costs. But that’s another story.)

What does that leave us with? The 1,180 new crosswalk signs were not mentioned in the musings of Taft or Coburn, so we can ignore those. In no case did any of the 450 signs duplicate existing roadside signs, so we can rule those out as well.

That leaves Taft’s sharrows.

""Those pictures on my blog were of signs on the roads just laid down by those workers. Just feet away were existing painted signs on the streets,"" Taft wrote to PolitiFact.

""Bicyclists already use the roads on which these signs were painted. Signs already existed there and new ones were therefore redundant and, in my opinion, a waste of taxpayer money.""

The new sharrows did duplicate smaller bike boulevard markings in some locations, but not even close to all of them. The photo Taft snapped was on Northwest Johnson Street, where several sharrows are located next to older and smaller bike circles, some faded, some not. (They also are along Northwest 24th Avenue.)  

Now, we wouldn’t have a problem if Coburn and Taft had dinged the city for wasting federal money on bike markings. Or for spending too much on overhead costs. But the message from the two was that all of the $900,000 was spent on slightly different signs where other signs ""already existed."" And that’s inaccurate. We rule the claim False.

Texas Rep. Warren Chisum of two minds on role of GOP caucus in speaker race
","
Pointing to the Republican romp in the November elections and a desire to see a ""conservative"" lead the Texas House, state Rep. Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, is pushing the GOP caucus to select a speaker candidate during its scheduled closed-door Jan. 10 meeting. 
""The voters of Texas have elected a strong overwhelming majority of Republicans to the Texas House of Representatives,"" Chisum says in a Dec. 21 press release. ""We need to respond to the will of the voters and work together to select a single Republican nominee for Speaker."" 
He then notes there are three GOP candidates for speaker and says the ""Republican caucus is the appropriate place for us to narrow the field to one candidate."" Chisum and Rep. Ken Paxton, R-McKinney, are challenging the current speaker, Rep. Joe Straus, R-San Antonio. Whoever wins the post presides over the House and appoints its committees and committee chairs. 
Any speaker candidate agreed upon within the 101-member GOP caucus would be all but guaranteed to win when the 150-member body elects the speaker Jan. 11. In committing their votes to that candidate, Republicans could unilaterally choose the speaker. 
We're not sure the speaker-apparent has ever been designated through a caucus vote. But in the last 20 years, the speaker has been chosen by the entire membership in open session on the House floor. That doesn't mean the outcome is a surprise: The votes generally accord with written pledges that speaker hopefuls have already secured from members. 
In a Jan. 3 letter to House members, former Democratic House Speaker Rayford Price urged lawmakers not to anoint a speaker through a GOP caucus vote. ""A majority of a political caucus has no right or authority to direct how any member will cast his vote,"" Price's letter states. ""I cannot believe any member would agree to give up that right and duty as is being suggested."" 
According to a July 2002 Austin American-Statesman news story, a similar push for the GOP caucus to hold a vote on a speaker candidate came that year, ahead of the November election, when Republicans were expected to win the majority in the Texas House for the first time in 130 years. The article says that ""Republican Party delegates voted at their convention in early June to require their House members to agree to vote as a caucus for speaker, and to bind all the Republicans to vote for whomever the caucus chooses."" 
But at about the same time, according to the story, 23 ""Republican House members signed an open letter to newspapers saying they thought the requirement flew in the face of the bipartisanship President George W. Bush lauded while he was governor."" There never was such a caucus vote, according to Rep. Todd Smith, R-Euless, among the signers of the 2002 letter. 
Chisum also was one of those 23 objectors, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reminded readers in a Dec. 23, 2010, blog post. Chisum's signature on that letter was also brought to our attention by GOP consultant Bryan Eppstein, who has Straus as a client. 
So, has Chisum changed his position on the appropriate way to pick a speaker? 
The 2002 Chisum-supported letter — which appeared in the Star-Telegram June 6, 2002 under the headline ""Let's not have partisan speaker elections"" — says that letting the majority party select the speaker would remake Texas in the image of Washington. ""In Washington, each party caucus nominates one candidate for speaker,"" the letter says. ""House members then are forced to vote for their party's candidate. A bare majority of the members ... of one political party decides who wins."" 
In contrast, the letter praises the Texas practice: ""The outcome is not determined by the majority party. It is an open election in which any member may nominate any other member. The speaker is elected by a majority of all members of the House — Republican and Democrat."" 
The letter urges House Republicans to resist calls for the caucus to select a single GOP candidate. ""Now that it appears Republicans will gain a majority of Texas House seats this November, some — but not all — of our Republican colleagues are eager to change this system and seize control so that no Democrat will have a voice in choosing the next speaker,"" the letter says. ""They want effectively to elect the speaker in the Republican caucus. To support such a monumental policy change simply and solely because it improves the odds of a particular speaker candidate is short sighted and fundamentally wrong."" 
We wondered what led Chisum to advocate a similar policy change for the 2011 speaker election. He did not respond to our inquiries. 
However, in a Dec. 29 press release, Chisum made an assertion that indicated he may be playing tit for tat with the Democrats. He said Democratic ""members of the Texas House caucused before the last legislative session to elect Speaker Straus. ... Therefore, when we convene on January 10th, I call on Representative (Larry) Taylor as the Republican Caucus chair, to call for a vote to determine the Republican preference for Speaker of the Texas House."" 
Soon after, a post on the online news site Quorum Report challenged Chisum's claim that the Democrats had caucused to elect Straus. Chisum fired back in a second news release that day, pointing to a pledge that some Democratic members made shortly before the 2009 session not to vote for the incumbent speaker, Rep. Tom Craddick, R-Midland. 
Chisum said: ""Now, it seems to me that when you see a letter with 64 signatures, released by the Democratic Caucus, all taking a unified party position on the speaker's race, that it just might be fair to say that the Democrats 'caucused' and took a position on the speaker's race. We all know that every one of those 64 Democrats subsequently pledged to vote and did vote for Joe Straus for speaker. ... My position is that the Republicans should also caucus and take a unified position on the race for speaker."" 
We're not truth-testing whether the Democrats' actions then constituted a caucus vote. The test is whether Chisum's recent call-to-caucus reverses the position he took in 2002. We find that it does. Mark this a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB914380>],/factchecks/2011/jan/08/warren-chisum/texas-rep-warren-chisum-two-minds-role-gop-caucus-/

GOP Chairman Mullins says health care bill ends pre-tax puchases of aspirin and other non-prescription drugs
","
Republican Party of Virginia Chairman Pat Mullins kicked off the New Year attacking recent side effects of health care overhaul on Flexible Spending Accounts, which allow workers to pay medical expenses with pre-tax dollars.

In an e-letter titled ""FSA at Work? Jim Webb Just Made It a Lot Less Useful,"" Mullins staples Virginia’s senior Senator to new provisions of the health care law that took effect Jan. 1.

""Desperate for tax dollars to pay for their $1 trillion health care takeover, Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, and Jim Webb decided to pick the pockets of consumers who opted to take responsibility for their own health care costs and remove the ability of consumers to use FSA and HSA plans to pay for things like aspirin and other non-prescription health needs,"" Mullins wrote.

He later reiterates the point, writing: ""Until this week, consumers could use their accounts to set aside pre-tax money for medical expenses. But thanks to Webb and other tax happy Democrats, over-the-counter drug purchases are now off limits to FSA and HSA accounts.""

There’s plenty of confusion about health care reform, so we checked to see if his claim about over-the-counter drugs is correct.

As a source, Mullins cited a news report from KSAT 12 out of San Antonio, Texas.

The report says, ""Over-the-counter medications will no longer be reimbursable through a health care flexible spending account, or FSA, even if the account has a grace period. So, Dec. 31 is the last day to stock up on pain relievers, allergy tablets, antacids and more for people who want to use them to exhaust their use-it-or-lose-it FSA.""

Not convinced San Antonio’s KSAT 12 is an end-all source for health care reform, we dug deeper.

According to the Internal Revenue Service guidance on flexible spending accounts, a new provision ""as added by the Affordable Care Act, provides that...beginning after December 31, 2010, expenses incurred for a medicine or a drug shall be treated as a reimbursement for medical expenses only if such medicine or drug is a prescribed drug (determined without regard to whether such drug is available without a prescription) or is insulin.""

In other words, you will no longer be able to use FSAs to pay for your aspirin, antacids and other over-the-counter drugs if they’re not prescribed by a physician.

What about HSAs -- tax-advantaged health savings accounts? Pretty much the same.

The IRS says that ""a distribution from an HSA...for a medicine or drug is a tax-free qualified medical expense only if (1) the medicine or drug requires a prescription, (2) is an over-the-counter medicine or drug and the individual obtains a prescription, or (3) is insulin.""

Otherwise, those ""non-qualified expenses"" will be taxed at 20 percent rather than the current 10 percent for HSA plan participants.

So, while the recently enacted portion of the health care law will not stop consumers from being able to buy over-the-counter drugs through their plans, it will require a prescription to do so.

On that count, Mullins stays relatively safe by employing the phrase ""non-prescription health needs"" at the end of his claim. True, those items like aspirin can still qualify for reimbursement with a prescription, but then they would not longer be ""non-prescription.""

But the same phrase also presents a problem for Mullins because other ""non-prescription"" items such as medical supplies and first-aid items remain eligible for reimbursement without a prescription.

""Over-the-counter medications are treated differently than over-the-counter medical items like Band-Aids, which are covered without a prescription,"" said Michael Waxman of Save Flexible Spending Plans.

If you’re wondering why these changes are taking place, the answer is likely money.

""I think [federal officials] were just looking for revenue raisers,"" Mike Thompson, a human resource services principal with the PwC recently told the Washington Post.

As that story notes, employee contributions to FSAs are made on a pretax basis, reducing earnings and thus the amount workers pay in income tax.

According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, tightening up the tax break on over-the-counter purchases will generate an estimated $5 billion in federal revenues through 2019.

And one last note: Webb, as Mullins said, did vote for the massive health care reform bill that limits the use of flexible spending accounts.

Let’s look back.

Mullins says health care law provisions that took effect Jan. 1 will ""remove the ability of consumers to use FSA and HSA plans to pay for things like aspirin and other non-prescription health needs.""

It’s true that as of Jan. 1, FSA and HSA plans no longer offered reimbursements for over-the-counter drugs without a prescription. However, those same items could be covered with a prescription.

Mullins misses a caveat by not noting that non-prescription items like crutches, bandages, and health supplies like diagnostic devices and blood sugar test kits remain covered. But his comments seem directed at drugs.

We find his claim True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA7B300>],/factchecks/2011/jan/07/pat-mullins/gop-chairman-mullins-says-health-care-bill-end-pre/
"['National', 'Bipartisanship', 'Steny Hoyer']","
Steny Hoyer says GOP didn't consult with Democrats on new House rules package
","
Whenever a new party takes control of the House of Representatives, one of the first and most important battles usually concerns the rules the chamber will operate under for the next two years.

On Jan. 4, 2011 -- one day before the Republicans officially took the gavel in the House -- Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., released a statement critical of the rules proposed by the new Republican majority. It was titled, ""Meet the New Republicans -- Same as the Old Republicans.""

""As the 112th Congress begins,"" the statement said, ""the 'new' House Republicans are starting off by returning to their old ways. Their rules package shows that while they made promises to the American people that they would govern differently and cut the deficit, they are already failing to live up to their pledge. ... Already they have shut Democrats out of the process in developing the rules package:

""• Number of Democrats in the room when package was written: 0.
""• Hours of discussion with Democrats: 0.
""• Number of Democratic amendments allowed: 0.""

For this fact check we're focusing on the question of discussion with Democrats.

First, some background on the House Rules Committee. Though it's not well-known among the public, the panel is highly influential. It sets the terms of debate for most significant bills that pass through the chamber -- how much time is allotted for debate, for instance, and what amendments will be allowed. It's also one of the purest forms of partisan control in a legislative chamber that gives almost untrammeled power to whichever party is in the majority.

Most committees are populated roughly in proportion to the two-party balance in the House, but the Rules Committee, in contrast, typically has about a two-to-one ratio in favor of the majority, and only rarely do members deviate from their party's position. The guidelines that the Rules Committee follows are largely set out in the rules package offered at the beginning of the year. That makes the rules package a high-stakes vote -- and one that is all but certain to be won by the majority party.

Given this background, it is a longstanding tradition that the rules package is put together by the majority, with limited minority input. So in the broad sense, Hoyer is right to characterize the process as one driven by Republicans. And as Hoyer surely knows, the Democrats did it the same way when they were in charge.

That said, there's evidence that the Republicans engaged in more than ""zero"" discussion with Democrats.

After the GOP won the majority on Nov. 2, 2010, party leaders appointed Greg Walden, R-Ore., to head the transition effort, which played a role in preparing the new rules package. Several media accounts documented that Walden reached out to Democrats during this process, and these stories named names.

Politico.com wrote that Walden ""consulted with Rep. Robert Brady, the Philadelphia Democrat who runs the House Administration Committee; New Jersey Rep. Robert Andrews; Massachusetts Rep. Michael Capuano, who ran the Democrats’ 2006 transition to power; and Washington Rep. Brian Baird, whom Walden calls his best Democratic friend."" (Baird retired after the last Congress, but the two talked during the lame-duck session in December.)

A spokesman for Brady confirmed to PolitiFact that Walden reached out ""formally and informally"" and that ""discussions"" were held during the transition from Democratic to Republican control.

Meanwhile, The Hill reported that Andrews and Brady were handpicked by none other than outgoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

For his part, Capuano, who chaired his party's transition to the majority in 2006, told the Washington Post that he offered the following wisdom to Walden: ""The majority will not be the majority forever, and the majority should treat the minority as they would want to be treated when they're in the minority.""

Hoyer's camp counters that these Democrats were part of the transition process rather than the rules-writing process. In a technical sense that's true, but a major part of the transition effort was to write a draft of the rules package.

In a Jan. 5, 2011, op-ed in Politico.com, Walden recalled the process of putting together the transition team, and he writes that the rules package played a large role in its work. ""The morning after Election Day, I organized a team of 22 lawmakers to re-write the rules that govern how the House does business and to scour the Capitol Hill operations for inefficiencies,"" Walden wrote.

And when the draft rules package was unveiled in late December, Walden was prominently featured. In its coverage of the draft unveiling, FoxNews.com reported that ""the reforms largely reflect the work of the GOP transition team led by Chairman Greg Walden of Oregon and House Rules working group chairman, Rep. Rob Bishop of Utah."" 
Hoyer is correct that transition team wrote the draft rules package rather than the final one, which had some modest differences. He’s also right that the final rules package -- which includes many provisions that Democrats oppose -- was written by Republicans alone. That is the way the process has worked in the House for as long as anyone can remember. But we believe Hoyer significantly overstepped when he said that there was ""zero"" Democratic input in the process. The Democratic input may have been only advisory, but GOP leaders did reach out to several Democrats for conversations on the rules package draft – something the Republicans were under no obligation to do. So we rate Hoyer's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB86700>],/factchecks/2011/jan/07/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-says-gop-didnt-consult-democrats-new-h/

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says the state can severely restrict contract bargaining rights for state employee unions
","
There’s little doubt about where Gov. Scott Walker is coming from when it comes to public employees and the size of state government.

With a hole of about $3 billion in the state budget, Walker aims to wring as many concessions as possible from state workers. In a Jan. 3, 2011 New York Times article, Walker called public employees ""haves"" and taxpayers ""have-nots."" And he has vowed to restore balance for  taxpayers.

In December 2010, even before he took office, the door opened wider for Walker when the Democratic-controlled Legislature could not muster enough votes to approve contracts for 39,000 state workers negotiated by outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat.

Those contracts, which cover 2009-2011, and future deals are now in the hands of Walker, a Republican, and the GOP-controlled Legislature.

In early December, at a Milwaukee Press Club luncheon, Walker indicated that when he took office he would take a broad view of his authority.

Walker said he was open to considering ""anything from the decertify all the way through modifications of the current laws in place.""

He added: ""The bottom line is that we are going to look at every legal means we have to try to put that balance more on the side of taxpayers and the people who care about services.""

If anything, now that Walker’s in office, the question of what authority he and like-minded lawmakers have to change bargaining rules is more important.

Could Walker, as he claimed, take action to sharply curtail the bargaining rights of state employee unions?

Let’s start with the question of ""decertifying"" unions.

That phrase refers to a decision by union members to disband. Government cannot decertify a union; only the members can. Walker clearly incorrectly used that term -- he repeated it after it was included in a question by a reporter at the Press Club event.  

In the wake of Walker’s comment, some critics seized on that word to declare Walker was flat-out wrong about what he could do as governor. However, focusing on the word ""decertify"" ignores the entirety of the full statement, which is what we are evaluating in this item.

""He can’t decertify a union per se,"" labor historian Ken Germanson said in a radio interview with WUWM.

But Germanson and other labor experts agree that Walker and the Legislature have control over bargaining parameters because it is the state that sets the rules for the areas subject to negotiations. That is, Walker can change the rules if the Legislature goes along.

And with Republicans holding both chambers, he may have support on those fronts.

What would Walker have to do?

It’s as simple -- and complicated -- as amending the state Employee Relations Act, said Peter Davis, general counsel at the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission.

While federal labor law covers unions at private employers; state employees are covered by that piece of state law. Though it has not changed much over the years, it could be changed.

""The rights established by the State Employment Labor Relations Act have not been amended in any significant way for at least the last 30 years -- aside from expanding/adding the types/numbers of employees who have (the) rights,"" Davis said.

Davis and other experts say Walker and the Legislature probably could not do away with labor unions entirely, but they could modify what’s subject to negotiations.

For instance, they could eliminate subjects like health insurance and pensions from collective bargaining. That would allow the administration to impose changes in those areas. Walker has said requiring employees to pay 5 percent of wages toward their pensions and 12 percent of their health care costs could save the state $150 million between January and June.

Other permitted topics for bargaining include wages, vacation time and work conditions.

State employee unions do not have a right to binding arbitration to settle impasses. And the labor act forbids strikes -- something the state likely would not want to give up.

Without arbitration or a credible strike threat, Davis said, when compared to other public employee unions ""state employee unions have always had less power at the bargaining table.""

Marty Beil, executive director of the Wisconsin State Employees Union, told the Journal Sentinel that the state law ""assures the uninterrupted delivery of high-quality public services and has kept labor peace for more than three decades.""

Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said the governor would not include a rewrite of the state law as part of the emergency special session of the Legislature called to deal with the economy and jobs.

He said there are a number of options available, including immediately beginning talks with state employee unions.

""There are two parties in contract negotiations, the state and the unions,"" Werwie said. ""My guess is that union leadership will stay the same, the state negotiator will change (under Walker), which I would argue is a 50 percent change in participants. That 50 percent change will provide the incoming administration with greater latitude in contract talks.""

All that remains to be seen. Where does that leave us right now?

In his response to a question, Walker misused the phrase ""decertify"" -- he can’t make state employees unions vanish. But labor experts agree with the central part of Walker’s statement -- the Legislature could rewrite the laws governing what issues are subject to negotiation, which could tilt the bargaining table in the administration’s favor.

We rate Walker’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC61CE40>],/factchecks/2011/jan/07/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-state-can-severely/
"['Georgia', 'History', 'Ray McBerry']","
Sons of Confederate Veterans spokesman said many blacks fought for the South
","
As the 150th anniversary of the Civil War's start approaches, a group of proud Southerners is belting out a rebel yell. 

The Georgia Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans paid the History Channel to air commercials that reject the view that the South fought the Civil War over slavery. The cable network dropped them after a complaint.

The head of public relations for the group's Georgia Division blasted the move Dec. 15 during ""Morning Edition"" on Atlanta public radio station WABE-FM (90.1).

""You’ll find blacks in almost every regiment throughout the South who fought right alongside white Southerners,"" said Ray McBerry. ""And in almost every case, it was a voluntary decision that the freed blacks made.""

Blacks? Fighting in almost every regiment? For a regime that backed slavery?

When we asked McBerry to elaborate, he said that it is ""an incontrovertible fact of history"" that blacks fought willingly as soldiers and in large numbers.

""They served just like white Southerners did,"" McBerry said.

He referred us to Charles Kelly Barrow, former historian in chief for the national SCV and a Griffin high school teacher, and books written and edited by Barrow and supporters of the theory.

We interviewed Barrow, talked to history professors and reviewed Civil War scholarship.   

First, a brief note. The debate over blacks in the Confederacy is part of an ugly disagreement over whether the Civil War was fought over slavery. People on both sides accuse each other of rewriting history to suit their prejudices.

This fact-check is not about that issue. We're only looking at McBerry's statement. 

Historians typically scoff at the idea that black soldiers served in large numbers for the Confederacy.

""I've been fighting this myth for years,"" said William Blair, a professor at Pennsylvania State University and director of the George and AnnRichards Civil War Era Center.

Documentation of blacks fighting for the South is scarce. There are anecdotes where blacks in Confederate regiments picked up muskets to fight or to defend themselves, but not enough to prove that it happened often, Blair and other historians said.

Blacks were barred from the Confederate army until just before the end of the war.

While SCV members are correct that Civil War history is complicated, their conclusion goes too far, said Brian Wills, director of the Center for the Study of the Civil War Era at Kennesaw State University.

""The fact was that you wouldn't want to arm people you considered capable of an insurrection,"" Wills said.

For the most part, the Civil War was a white man's fight by the North and South.

The Union Army barred blacks until after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. Some 180,000 blacks served in the Union army, often in support roles. 

In the South, arming blacks was controversial. States restricted or banned blacks from owning guns.

They became laborers instead. Thousands of blacks, free and slave, worked as Confederate cooks, teamsters, fortification builders, and medical care providers. Slaves went to war with their masters to tend to their needs. This work brought African-Americans to the front lines.

Gen. Robert E. Lee quietly supported the enlistment of blacks, and another general lobbied to emancipate and arm slaves. But President Jefferson Davis squelched such talk, saying the idea ""would revolt and disgust the whole South.""

The Confederate Congress finally authorized the enlistment of 300,000 black troops in March 1865, after the white ranks were thinned by combat, disease and desertion. The war ended weeks later. Few blacks had enlisted by that time.

Still, the idea that blacks fought in large numbers for the Confederacy has ardent advocates. The prologue of ""Black Confederates,"" a book edited by Barrow, cites ""conservative estimates"" of 50,000 to 60,000 of them but gives no evidence to support the numbers.

Books that purport to prove the phenomenon was widespread are collections of anecdotes where blacks and mixed-race men wore Confederate uniforms, worked as sharpshooters, volunteered to fight, and even killed Union soldiers in battle.

Barrow's ""Black Confederates"" documents 61 blacks who received pensions from state and local governments in North Carolina, Mississippi and South Carolina. Nearly 300 applied for pensions in Tennessee, it says, but it's unclear whether they received them. Records suggest they were noncombatants. 

Yet even if you accept all of these accounts, they fall well short of proving McBerry's case. 

These were isolated cases. There were 500,000 to 2 million (estimate vary widely) Confederate soldiers who took part in the war.

McBerry and Barrow boost the number of black Confederates by counting black laborers as soldiers, saying soldiers perform similar duties for the present-day U.S. Army. 

""They [blacks] ate the same bad food, and when it rained on soldiers, it rained on them,"" Barrow said. ""People, regardless of whether they're black or white, they need to be honored for their services because they gave so much.""  

But the difference between a black laborer and a Confederate soldier is more than a matter of formal recognition. It's fundamental.

Bondsmen were property. If they resisted, they ran the risk of being terrorized, beaten or worse. 

Furthermore, even if large numbers of blacks wanted to fight for the Rebel cause, the obstacles would have been daunting. 

Thousands would have had to bear arms even though it was illegal and join forces with armed white soldiers who did not want them as comrades.

We find that McBerry's claim that blacks ""fought right alongside white Southerners"" and ""in almost every regiment throughout the South"" is incorrect, if not absurd. Even supporters of his theory have found nothing more than isolated cases.

If McBerry's claim were true, it would not only mean that thousands of blacks took up arms for a government that supported their enslavement, it would also mean they were willing to battle overwhelming odds to do it.

We rate McBerry's statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7A9CC0>],/factchecks/2011/jan/07/ray-mcberry/sons-confederate-veterans-spokesman-said-blacks-fo/

Lloyd Doggett says tax cut for richest Americans exceeds annual income of average Central Texas families
","
Austin U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett vigorously opposed the deal reached between President Barack Obama and Republicans to extend tax cuts initially put in place by Congress when Republican George W. Bush was president.

After Vice President Joe Biden urged House Democrats Dec. 9 to vote for the deal, Doggett told reporters: ""If it's take it or leave it, we'll leave it,"" according to an online USA Today news post. Early Dec. 17, the House approved the extension. Doggett then said on CNN’s ""American Morning:"": ""We all like less taxes. But this came at an immense cost. It's our money. It certainly is. But it's also our (future) debt.""

Doggett, a Democrat representing the state's 25th Congressional District, which takes in parts of Travis and Bastrop counties plus Hays and five counties south and east of Austin, had swung home before the vote. And on Dec. 12, he told Austin’s KVUE-TV, Channel 24: ""The richest 1 percent of America will get a bigger tax cut through this bill than the family income of the average family here in Central Texas. That’s just not equitable.""

Solid comparison?

To our inquiry, Doggett’s office passed along a report by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal group focused on federal, state and local tax policies and their impact. The Dec. 9 report states that under the extension, the nation’s wealthiest 1 percent would enjoy an average tax cut of almost $77,000 in 2011. The report says that in Texas, the wealthiest 1 percent would see an average cut of $79,563.

Doggett spokesman Cameron Arterton said the U.S. Census Bureau says the median family income for Doggett’s Congressional District 25 based on a 2009 survey is estimated at $57,723. Arterton said for Travis County, the median family income is $67,030; for Hays County, $70,998; and for Bastrop County, $55,344. To refresh, the median is not the same as the average, which is based on adding up all the family incomes and dividing the total by the number of families. In this instance, half of the area’s families have a lower income than the median and half of the area’s families have a higher income than the median.

At the Census Bureau, spokeswoman Jenna Arnold guided us to county-by-county survey research showing estimated median and mean (or average) family incomes for the counties singled out by Doggett’s office for 2005-09; they differ slightly from the one-year estimates cited by Doggett’s office. For 2005-09,  the median family income in Travis County is estimated at $69,251, about $25,000 less than the county’s average estimated family income of $94,955. Bastrop County’s median family income, $59,582, was about $12,000 less than its estimated average, $71,656. Hays County’s median family income, $72,647, was about $14,000 less than its estimated average, $86,364.

Median or mean, what’s the best way to judge income?

Lloyd Potter, the state demographer, told us that generally, he prefers to use average (or mean) income in comparisons rather than median income. ""There’s something intuitive about the concept of an average,"" he said.

But averages, Potter said, are sometimes distorted by extreme values at the high or low ends.
""So if you had someone (in your county) who was really wealthy, like a billionaire, or just a couple, that would pull the mean up fairly significantly. It’s perhaps misleading as far as how most people are living,"" Potter said. ""You’ve got some very wealthy people in Travis County. Doesn’t Sandra Bullock live there?""

We heard next from Doggett, who pointed out via e-mail that in his Dec. 16 House remarks opposing the extension, he correctly compared the tax cut for the wealthiest Americans to median--not average--family incomes in Central Texas.

Doggett said that in the earlier KVUE interview, ""I wasn’t trying to change the standard of measurement... I was conveying the same important point about this tax deal -- the inequality between the tax benefits for the wealthiest 1 percent in this deal and the typical family income in our area for an entire year.""

His e-mail continues: ""Even if you strictly limit ‘average’ to mean ‘mean,’ not ‘median,’ my statement is still accurate for the congressional district I represent."" His office pointed us to census research indicating that family incomes in the district averaged $75,455 for 2005-09 in 2009 inflation-adjusted dollars.

Doggett added that ""‘median’ is a type of ‘average’ too according to Merriam Webster’s online, which lists the first definition of  ‘average’ as ‘a single value (as a mean, mode, or median) that summarizes or represents the general significance of a set of unequal values.’)""

As he acknowledges, Doggett didn’t specify median or mean incomes to KVUE, enabling his statement to leave the misimpression that the 2011 tax cut for the nation’s wealthiest 1 percent exceeds the average income of Central Texas families.

Solely considering average family incomes, his claim doesn’t hold up for two of three counties singled out by his office. Taking median incomes into account, though, his statement is supported.

Columnist Brent Larkin's claim about 1935 steam train stoked with truth
","
If former Gov. Ted Strickland had used a theme song in his unsuccessful re-election bid, it might have been ""I've Been Working on the Railroad.""

Jobs were the biggest issue of the fall campaign, and Strickland said that thousands would be created by his plan for a ""3C Corridor"" passenger rail system linking Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. He described Gov.-elect John Kasich’s intention to kill the plan and return a $400 million federal grant as tragic and a job-killer.

Critics of the plan claimed that its employment potential was exaggerated, its ridership forecasts were too optimistic and its cost projections too low.

Ultimately, Plain Dealer columnist and former editorial director Brent Larkin wrote: ""Voters never warmed to the idea of spending hundreds of millions on a passenger rail project that would have taken riders from Cleveland to Cincinnati over a period an hour and 15 minutes longer than it would have taken on a New York Central train in 1935.""

We don’t usually look at remarks from columnists, but that comment stopped PolitiFact Ohio in its tracks.

We knew that the 3C Corridor was not a high-speed rail plan. We had not realized it was more like a trip back in time.

So PolitiFact Ohio asked Larkin where he got his figures.

He referred us first to a year-old feasibility report on the proposed Cleveland-to-Columbus-to- Cincinnati Amtrak service.

""This is the schedule Amtrak said it would run, and the schedule Ohio included as part of its application to the feds for the $400 million,"" Larkin said. ""No other schedule was ever formally provided to the feds.""

The proposed schedule shows a 255-mile Cleveland to Cincinnati trip taking 6-1/2 hours. The first daily train would leave Cleveland at 6:30 a.m. and arrive in Cincinnati at 1 p.m.

Larkin then shared a railroad timetable from New York Central Lines, effective Feb 3, 1935. It showed a departure time of 3:10 p.m. from Cincinnati and an arrival in Cleveland of 8:20 p.m., for a travel time of 5 hours 10 minutes -- an hour and 20 minutes faster than the 3C line.

Criticism of the 3C as ""snail rail"" with an average speed of 39 mph started as soon as the project was proposed.

The Ohio Department of Transportation responded in September with a new average estimate of 50 mph and ""speed up to 79."" It shortened the Cleveland-to-Cincinnati trip to 5 hours 12 minutes.

But, not so fast.

As an October story in the Columbus Dispatch noted, ODOT itself had said a year earlier that the trip couldn't be made in less than 5 hours 20 minutes -- even if the trains didn't stop. ODOT’s revised schedule hadn't even been seen by the three freight lines that own the tracks the 3C passenger trains would use, putting its feasibility in serious doubt.

And, no matter how weak or strong its support, the optimistic revision still comes up longer than the best rail time of 1935.

""The schedules speak for themselves,"" Larkin said.

We rate his statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBF05C0>],/factchecks/2011/jan/07/brent-larkin/columnist-brent-larkins-claim-about-1935-steam-tra/
"['Jobs', 'Virginia', 'Gerry Connolly']","
Rep. Gerry Connolly says federal workforce hasn't grown since 1990
","
Mention the federal government and people inevitably say it’s too big. Rep. Gerry E. Connolly, D-Va., disagrees.

Connolly defends federal government employees. He represents almost 60,000 of them in Northern Virginia’s 11th Congressional District.

Talking with The Washington Post just before Christmas, Connolly addressed what he views as a growing anti-public sector sentiment in America.

""I think the Congress we elected in November is a lot less hospitable to the interests of federal employees,"" he said. ""I think you're going to see a lot more legislative action and suggestion aimed at reducing the size and compensation of that federal workforce and retirees.""

Connolly said the notion that federal government is over sized is misplaced.

""Facts be damned: There's a lot of rhetoric on the other side about the growth of the federal workforce, but it's about the size it was under the first President Bush,"" he said. ""There hasn't really been a lot of net growth in the federal workforce when you compare it to say, 1990. It's not like it's gotten out of hand, it's true.""

Is it really?

There are two answers. On one hand, Connolly is understating his case. On the other, he’s ignoring the true size of government.   

According to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, in 1990 total government employment -- including all branches and uniformed military personnel --  was 5.23 million. By 2009, that number dropped to 4.43 million. If we exclude military personnel, the number fell from 3.128 million in 1990 to 2.84 million in 2009.

After years of decline, those workforce numbers did begin to rise in 2008.  

To get a more current read, we turned to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which has preliminary figures as recent as November 2010.

According to BLS data, total federal government employment was 3.103 million in January 1990. Preliminary numbers for November 2010 are 2.837 million.

Even if you don’t count postal service workers, the story holds true. In January 1990, the figure was 2.273 million excluding those employees and in November 2010 it was down to 2.195 million.

""The reality is that the federal workforce got much smaller between 1989 and 2009, almost entirely driven by deep cuts following the end of the Cold War, "" said Paul Light, a professor of public service at New York University. ""The Defense Department workforce fell from about 1 million civilian employees in 1990 to roughly 650,000 by 2004 and has inched up by 100,000 or so since. That was a big ""peace dividend"" that allowed Bill Clinton to claim that the era of big government was over.""

But there’s a catch, and it’s huge.

While official workforce figures have gone down in recent decades, use of government contractors has exploded, especially in the defense sector following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

In fiscal 2000, the government spent $208 billion on contractors. In fiscal 2009, that figure was up more than 150 percent, to $540 billion.

What does that mean for the workforce? Well, if you consider government contractors federal employees and view grantees -- like universities -- as employing people on behalf of the federal government (""Nuclear labs are run by universities, but are clearly federal agencies,"" said Light), the numbers have rocketed.

""I think the true size of government is going up -- often for good reasons such as the need to reduce backlogs in key service agencies...and increase the number of inspectors needed to execute the rules on deepwater drilling, workplace discrimination, etc.,"" Light said.

The problem, Light says, is that the total government workforce number including contractors is elusive and difficult to calculate. He said the the only way to get a proper sense of it is to take existing data on every government contract transaction and run it through a model used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Light did that in 2006 and found that the ""true size"" of the federal government workforce was 14.6 million employees including civil servants, postal workers, military personnel, contractors, and grantees. More than half of that total was contractors.

In 1990, Light says the true size of the federal government was 12.6 million, meaning that by his definition, the federal workforce had increased 2 million by 2006.

""BLS and OPM are fixated, as is the Republican Congress, on the number of federal employees, and have no way to count the hidden workforce,"" Light said. ""Unfortunately, no one really wants to know the answer. It's a big, big number that would inflame public anger and is generally avoided by both parties.""

So let’s look back.

Connolly says the the size of the federal government's workforce has not grown much since 1990, when George H.W. Bush was President. Based on the official numbers he sources, he’s safe.  

But there are two definitions of ""federal workforce"": 1) Public servants working directly for the government and earning benefits, or 2) Light’s version: ""everyone who gets their paycheck directly from Uncle Sam or through contracts and other purchasing vehicles.""

Even accepting that the interview was based on the former definition and Connolly’s statement is true on its face, it ignores the $500 billion gorilla pounding on the Capitol dome: the increased use of government contractors, which has allowed the number of federal bureaucrats to decline.

Connolly’s claim is accurate but incomplete, therefore we find it Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB95D4C0>],/factchecks/2011/jan/06/gerry-connolly/rep-gerry-connolly-says-federal-workforce-hasnt-gr/
