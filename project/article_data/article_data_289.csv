In Wisconsin recall, NRA says Dem challenger Tom Barrett voted to ban deer hunting guns
","
In the Wisconsin gubernatorial recall campaign, Democratic challenger Tom Barrett has been hit by Republican Gov. Scott Walker on his record as Milwaukee's mayor.

Taking a new tack, the National Rifle Association, which has endorsed Walker, goes back in time to attack Barrett's record in Congress, where he served for a decade before deciding not to run again in 2002.

In a radio ad that began airing in May 2012, two men talk about Barrett. Here’s part of the conversation:

Man 1: ""Well, Barrett voted to ban 15 different kinds of guns, even a lot of common deer rifles.""

Man 2: ""I love my deer rifle. Barrett voted to ban ‘em?""

Man 1: ""Yeah.""

Wisconsin's gun deer hunting season is months away, but you can bet the hundreds of thousands of hunters in the Badger State took notice of the NRA's claim.

Is it on target?

To back its claim, the NRA cited Barrett's 1994 vote to ban the manufacture, sale and new ownership of 19 semiautomatic assault-style weapons. The measure was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, who said the guns ""were designed to kill people"" and ""had no place on a deer hunt.""

The law contained provisions, however, allowing sales of the guns to continue. And the law expired in 2004, after Republican leaders in Congress refused to consider renewing it.

Among the weapons covered by the law were semiautomatic rifles that had ""an ability to accept a detachable magazine"" and at least two of these characteristics: ""folding or telescoping stock; a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon; a bayonet mount; a flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to accommodate a flash suppressor; and a grenade launcher.""

Does this apply to ""a lot of common deer rifles"" as the ad claims?

NRA’s evidence

NRA research director John Frazer cited five newspaper and magazine articles from the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the Soviet-model AK-47 assault rifle was becoming more popular with hunters in that area, including deer hunters. One gun shop owner was quoted as saying hunters had been using military-style semi-automatic rifles since before World War II. The Houston Post reported that, according to local gun shop managers, it was not uncommon for Texans to hunt with semiautomatic rifles. That article didn’t indicate, however, whether the specific guns targeted in the ban were commonly used for deer hunting.

On a national scale, American Hunter magazine praised the Heckler & Koch 91 as a hunting rifle for deer and other game, but didn’t indicate whether it was popular among deer hunters. In fact, the writer said the gun might be a ""‘black sheep’ to traditionalists.""

Similarly, American Rifleman praised a particular type of AK-47 ammunition for hunting white-tail deer, but didn’t discuss whether the gun itself was common among deer hunters. The magazine later reported, though, that ""hundreds of thousands of shooters and hunters,"" including whitetail deer hunters, were using another gun covered by the ban, the AR-15.

So, there’s an indication that some deer hunters used the weapons targeted by the ban, but none of the articles was specific to Wisconsin. The NRA’s claim was broad in nature, but its ad is aimed at Wisconsin voters.

Wisconsin experts

We contacted three Wisconsin gun deer hunting experts.

Each said flatly that the banned weapons were not commonly used for deer hunting when the ban became law in 1994.

The experts were Tim Lawhern, administrator of the enforcement division of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the state agency that oversees deer hunting; Mark Toso, president of the Wisconsin Deer Hunters Association and Paul A. Smith, outdoors editor of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Each has more than 30 years of experience hunting deer.

Lawhern, who taught DNR hunter safety classes for 18 years, recalled that when he worked in the field in the mid-1990s he would see perhaps half a dozen hunters each season using an assault-style weapon.

Toso -- who said he recently ended his longtime NRA membership in opposition to many of the group’s political messages -- called the percentage of gun deer hunters using weapons covered by the ban ""tiny"" at the time of the ban. (His association has not made an endorsement in the governor’s race.)

And Smith said that from his experience, while firearms such as the AK-47 and the AR-15 ""have gained favor among some hunters and sport shooters in recent decades, they constitute a small fraction of deer hunting rifles in use today and were an even smaller fraction in 1994.""

Our rating

The NRA said Barrett voted to ban ""a lot of common deer rifles.""

The statement holds an element of truth in that some deer hunters used some of the weapons. But the statement ignores facts that create a different impression. Experts agreed that the once-banned weapons were not commonly used for deer hunting.

We rate the claim Mostly False.

Marcy Kaptur says her district makes more cars than all of California
","
Like most members of Congress, Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur is a big booster of her congressional district. During a May 17 appearance on C-SPAN, Kaptur described the reconfigured area that she’ll represent if she wins her race against Republican Samuel ""Joe the Plumber"" Wurzelbacher as ""the crown jewels of Ohio.""

To illustrate the area’s industrial prowess,  Kaptur discussed how she enjoys pulling her car over beside the railroad tracks in Toledo and watching all the flatbeds go by, full of steel coils, bar steel and other metals bound for auto plants or gas drilling facilities elsewhere in Ohio.

One of Kaptur’s boasts about the area’s manufacturing accomplishments got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention.

""The region I represent, both currently and in the future, has more automotive plants than the entire state of California,"" Kaptur said.

Could the slice of Ohio that Kaptur now represents, as well as the new district that stretches along Lake Erie between Toledo and Cleveland, really have more auto plants than the nation’s most populous state?

Getting the answer was be easier than we thought.

It turns out that California no longer has any auto plants. The last car one - a joint venture between Toyota and General Motors in Fremont - closed in 2010. The Los Angeles Times said the plant’s closure marked the ""the end of large-scale auto manufacturing in California, which over the years boasted a dozen or more plants building vehicles ranging from Studebakers to Camaro muscle cars.""  

Toyota made Corollas cars and Tacoma pickup trucks at the plant in Fremont, while GM made Pontiac Vibes.

GM dropped its portion of the plant in its bankruptcy. Then Toyota scrapped its portion. At the time, the United Auto Workers union criticized Toyota for the decision, saying it was dumping the plant because it was the company’s only unionized facility in the United States.

Tesla Motors wants to  reopen that factory to manufacture its all-electric Model S sedan, but hasn’t yet done so.

The district that Kaptur currently represents has four auto plants, according to her spokesman, Steve Fought: Chrysler’s Toledo Supplier Park and Toledo North plants,  GM’s Toledo Transmission plant, and KBI’s bearing plant  in Sandusky. The new Ninth District will have three more: Ford’s Brook Park Engine Plant,  Ford’s Avon Lake plant, and GM’s Parma Metal Center.

The number of auto plants in Kaptur’s current and new congressional districts both exceed the number of auto plants in California - zero.

"['Georgia', 'Transportation', 'Citizens for Transportation Mobility']","
Pro-transportation tax group says projects will be boon for jobs
","
Backers of a tax to overhaul metro Atlanta’s roadways and transit are telling voters it’s a pro-jobs proposal.

A study from the Atlanta Regional Commission, the region’s planning body, said so, according to a Georgia Trend magazine advertising supplement sponsored by Citizens for Transportation Mobility:

""The Atlanta Regional Commission’s analysis and forecast of the economic impacts of the 2012 Atlanta Regional Transportation Referendum’s passage show that . . . metro Atlanta will create or support an additional 200,000 new jobs, including jobs that are maintained year over year.""

Atlanta can sure use a couple of hundred thousand jobs. Is this true?

We asked a Citizens for Transportation Mobility spokeswoman, who sent us a link to ""Economic Impacts of the Transportation Referendum, 2013-2040."" The report details the ARC study.

Citizens for Transportation Mobility is a pro-transportation tax advocacy group. However, the ARC is an intergovernmental organization, so it has not taken a stand on the referendum.

The ARC study used a widely accepted economic model to predict what would happen if projects funded by the proposed 1 percent sales tax were built. It compares this scenario to one where the region continues with Plan 2040, its existing transportation blueprint.

Plan 2040 builds projects slated for construction under the transportation tax proposal, but over a much longer period of time.

The ARC’s carefully worded analysis does show that the new 1 percent sales tax and the transportation overhaul it funds would boost jobs, especially once construction is complete.

This is how it works, according to the report and an interview with Mike Alexander, the ARC’s research chief:

Most of the expected jobs growth would take place years in the future when the new infrastructure is built, Alexander said. Fewer delays would make it easier for members of the workforce, employers, customers and producers to gain access to one another.

The ARC’s analysis predicts that the effects of the reduced delays will ripple through metro Atlanta’s economy and ""support"" 200,000 ""job years"" over and above those that would exist if voters nixed the plan.

But when a project ""supports"" one ""job year,"" that doesn’t mean that it creates a new job for one worker.

A ""job year"" is a term economists use to describe one job lasting one year. For example, if a construction worker gets hired to pour concrete for six months, this would count as half of a job year.  

If that same construction worker gets hired to pour concrete for three years, his work would count as three job years.

If a project ""supports"" a job year, it doesn’t mean that it creates one. That three-year job pouring concrete is new only in the year that the worker gets hired. The project ""supports"" the job in the following two years.

These may seem like arcane distinctions, but they’re important. If Citizens for Transportation Mobility said that the transportation tax ""would create 200,000 new jobs,"" that would be misleading. The bulk of those jobs would not be new.

Instead, the ad said that the transportation tax would ""create or support an additional 200,000 new jobs,"" and specified that some of these jobs are ""maintained year over year.""

Alexander and others argued that this wording makes clear that the jobs figure includes positions that last for more than one year. PolitiFact Georgia sees their point, but the sentence is a bit opaque.

We also found another hitch. These hundreds of thousands of job years would emerge over the course of a generation, according to the analysis. The study measures growth over a 28-year time period from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2040.

The one-year average would be 7,120. Through 2019, it would generate or support less than 2,000 a year, according to the analysis. By 2040, that number approaches 14,000.

This long time horizon made us wonder whether the Citizens for Transportation Mobility’s claim gives the impression that jobs would appear sooner than the ARC analysis says.

Bert Brantley, a public relations expert involved in the writing of the advertorial, said this is not the case. He noted that the ad’s next three paragraphs specify that economic gains such as savings from reduced travel time and an increase in personal income would develop by 2040.

But when it came to jobs, this decades-long time horizon wasn’t clear. In fact, the supplement  suggests that the transportation tax would help Georgia’s economic recovery -- a process that’s going on right now:

""The region would gain 34,000 new jobs in construction alone, allowing us to recoup more than half of the 57,000 construction jobs lost to the Great Recession,"" the ad states.

Even though Citizens for Transportation Mobility attempts to tread carefully over the subject of jobs, its jobs claim isn’t clear enough.

The average reader would walk away from the advertising supplement thinking that the transportation overhaul would create 200,000 jobs in the next few years.

But those are job years. In fact, we don’t know how many of what your typical person would consider actual jobs this effort would create.

Citizens for Transportation Mobility would have been much better off if it said the overhaul would create or sustain an average of 7,120 jobs each year.

The statement contains a kernel of truth, but it is so unclear on important specifics that it is misleading. It meets PolitiFact’s definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B95280>],/factchecks/2012/may/29/citizens-transportation-mobility/pro-transportation-tax-group-says-projects-will-be/
"['Rhode Island', 'Education', 'Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Joseph McNamara']","
R.I. Rep. Joseph McNamara says 25 percent of Rhode Island’s physicians graduated from for-profit medical schools
","
State Rep. Joseph M. McNamara has been out front supporting a virtually unheard of idea in America: a for-profit medical school.

McNamara, a Warwick Democrat  who chairs the House Health, Education and Welfare Committee, is pushing a bill that would place a  ""Rhode Island School of Osteopathic Medicine"" on the same local stage now dominated by Brown University’s nonprofit Warren Alpert Medical School.

In advocating for the school, McNamara took to the House floor recently.

Responding to insinuations from a Brown dean that for-profit schools produced less competent doctors, McNamara told fellow legislators ""in the state of Rhode Island 25 percent of our current physicians are graduates of for-profit medical schools."" And, McNamara said, no one’s suggesting they’re any less qualified than doctors from nonprofit schools.

We’re aware of the growing number of for-profit colleges and universities around the country, particularly on the web. But for-profit medical schools are much rarer. We wondered whether so many of Rhode Island’s doctors could be graduates of such schools.

So we called McNamara and asked where he got his 25 percent figure. McNamara said it was cited in a letter he received from Steven C. Rodger,  the principal proponent of the for-profit medical school.

Rodger is president and CEO of R3 Education, a Massachusetts-based holding company that runs three for-profit medical schools in the Caribbean offering MD degrees. Rodger had earlier told McNamara’s committee that the new Rhode Island school would help ease the state’s shortage of primary care physicians, create up to 300 new jobs and generate more tax revenue, while charging significantly lower tuition than other medical schools.

When McNamara faxed us Rodger’s letter, we immediately saw a couple of problems with his statement. The most obvious: the letter doesn’t say what McNamara said on the House floor, that 25 percent of Rhode Island’s doctors graduated from for-profit schools.

Instead, it says Rhode Island has ""over 25 percent of its active physicians workforce comprised of IMG’s,"" an acronym for international medical graduates. In other words: more than a quarter of Rhode Island’s doctors, according to the letter, graduated from international medical schools. That doesn’t mean they are all for-profit schools.

We called Rodger to find out where his figure came from. He pointed us to the 2011 State Physician Workforce Data Book,  published by the Association of American Medical Colleges.

That report includes a table (actually prepared by the American Medical Association) showing that 908 of Rhode Island’s 3,513 active physicians in 2010 graduated from international medical schools, or 25.8 percent.

That places Rhode Island 11th in the country in terms of the percentage of doctors who graduated from international medical schools.

But again that doesn’t get to McNamara’s statement that a quarter of the state’s doctors graduated from for-profit medical schools.

The United States has only one for-profit medical school, according to several sources:Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine, in Parker, Colo., which opened in 2008.

There are more than 2,246 medical schools around the world (including 137 accredited U.S. schools), according to the Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research. That’s a nonprofit group associated with the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, a private Philadelphia organization that certifies the readiness of international medical students into U.S. graduate programs.

Rodger said he believes that most international medical schools, such as the three his company runs, are for-profit ventures, but he didn’t have any hard facts. His letter to McNamara made the same general statement without any attribution.

PolitiFact Rhode Island tried to verify if that was true by checking with the Association of American Medical Colleges, the American Medical Association, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine and finally the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates.

None could say how many international medical schools were for-profit.

Our ruling

McNamara concedes he misspoke on the House floor. He said ""25 percent of our current physicians are graduates of for-profit medical schools."" He meant to say that a quarter of Rhode Island’s doctors graduated from international medical schools.

McNamara says he was relying on information Rodger presented: ""We [legislators] assume that people give us information that is accurate."" But Rodger did provide accurate information -- as far as it went -- McNamara just cited it inaccurately.

We rule his statement False.

Abele says Act 10 left Milwaukee County budget millions of dollars short
","
Attempting to punch a hole in Gov. Scott Walker’s oft-repeated assertion that his Act 10 collective bargaining reforms would offset cuts in state aid, Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele says the reverse is true for his county.

The net shortfall from $28.7 million in state budget cuts -- after the savings attributable to Act 10 are figured in -- was $6.7 million, according to county budget analysts. (A rough tally from Abele’s office initially put the shortfall much higher, at about $21.4 million.)

""While Act 10 allowed us to save some money, it was millions short of what we needed to fill the hole left by the $28 million cut in state aid,"" Abele said in an April 12, 2012, statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Not surprisingly, Walker, who is facing a June 5, 2012, recall election that grew out of anger over his cuts to collective bargaining, disagrees.

The governor’s office maintains that despite more than $28 million in state cuts, Milwaukee County wound up with an extra $10 million on its balance sheet in 2012, thanks to Walker’s collective bargaining ""tools.""

""In addition to Milwaukee County realizing more savings than the (state) reduction they received in shared revenue, they now have the ability to manage legacy costs moving forward,"" said Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie.

So how well did the ""tools"" -- Walker’s shorthand for union curbs and benefit cost shifting – work in his home county?

Was it a $10 million savings a shortfall of almost $7 million?

We can’t imagine many complaints about a surplus. So, we’ll look at Abele’s claim that the county got the short end of the deal.  

First, some important history.

Walker has highlighted specific instances where his sharp rollback of collective bargaining resulted in fiscal gains at the local government level. In the case of Milwaukee County, where he was county executive for eight years, Walker has a more personal connection with how his signature move as governor would play out.

After all, Walker had tried with some success to push through employee concessions in 2009 and 2010, proposing and signing budgets that counted on union employees agreeing to shoulder a bigger share of benefit costs. That strategy provided a partial template for his moves as governor.

In his budget speech in March, Walker flatly said local government would come out ahead under Act 10, then known as the budget-repair bill.

""It’s true we are reducing aid to local government by just over $1.25 billion, but we are providing almost $1.5 billion in savings through our budget repair bill,"" he said. For emphasis, he added, ""Let me repeat that despite the reductions in our budget, local governments would gain $150 million overall in the biennium.""

Let’s look specifically at Milwaukee County.

Cuts vs. savings

County officials say the various aid cuts in the 2011-’13 state budget added up to $28.7 million. Those included trims to shared revenue, transportation aid, child support enforcement and money for locking up juvenile offenders.

The governor’s staff doesn’t dispute any of that. However, they argue the county also saved $4.9 million because the state assumed control of more than 300 county public assistance employees and that number should be counted as an offset to the aid cut.

But the $4.9 million figure was an estimate of the county’s long-term liability for pensions and health care for those workers when they retire -- not an annual operating cost.

The agreement on the state takeover of those workers ended an annual payment to the county intended to cover a bit of that pension liability. It did not relieve the county of its remaining anticipated pension costs for that group.

Werwie, the governor’s spokesman, argued it was fair game to count the $4.9 million as savings because the state agreed to pick up retirement costs of the newer public aid workers who had not yet been vested with county pension rights.

But those few newer employees were not figured in the county’s ongoing pension liability for the lion’s share of the transferred employees.

So that money shouldn’t be counted as savings.

Additional points of contention

On the savings side, the dispute focuses on several additional points.

Werwie pointed to figures included in the county’s 2011 and 2012 budgets that list pension and health insurance costs. For 2012, the numbers drop by $31 million for the fringe benefit portion of the budgets.

Changes the county made to shift more health insurance and pension costs onto employees this year were made possible by Act 10, which led to the expiration of union contracts for most county employees.

Under the collective bargaining changes, local governments were able to force most workers to pay a greater share of pension and health care costs.

While the county set the share of health care costs at  28 percent, Act 10 put no limit on how much of that could be shifted to employees. So the county could have used the new law to get more savings by making workers pay even more. (County officials say going higher would have been tough to achieve and made it harder to recruit and retain employees.)

So it’s clear Act 10 opened the door to more health savings the county didn’t pursue.

County budget officials say the governor’s analysis fails to account for more than $9 million in reduced pension and health costs that were already done a year earlier and noted in another part of the county budget. Those 2011 budget changes were made during Walker’s last year as county executive -- not as a result of Act 10.

Walker can legitimately claim credit for those earlier changes, but they weren’t a result of the reforms he pushed through after becoming governor.

By the county’s figures, the pension and health care savings in 2012 attributable to Walker’s Act 10 union changes amounted to $22 million.

Finally, Werwie says another $3 million in county pension savings should be added to the mix. He points to a Journal Sentinel article that says cutting future pension service credit by 20 percent and raising the retirement age from 60 to 64 could save $3 million in 2012.

But those savings were based on earlier changes and already included in the 2012 budget figure for pension savings, county budget officials said. Tallying up another $3 million for those things would inaccurately double count them.

In a footnote to his other points, Werwie also suggested Walker deserved credit for an additional savings from the state of $7 million in costs to the county for housing juvenile offenders in state lockups. But that figure represents the hypothetical extra cost the county might have had if Walker had not acted to close two juvenile institutions -- not a real boost in state aid.

Let’s reload the spreadsheets.

Our rating

Abele said the county came out a net loser under Walker’s budget cuts and reforms to the tune of a $6.7 million shortfall. That’s in contrast to claims by Walker it was a $10 million winner.

Most of the differences in accounting were due to the governor claiming credit for changes already made by the county in advance of the Act 10 reforms. Walker’s office also claimed savings for long-term pension costs for 300 county workers who transferred to the state, but whose pension obligations stayed with the county.

Walker can take some credit for changes while county executive, but we are looking at Abele’s  claim and he limited it to the changes Walker made as governor.

By the numbers, Abele is correct that the changes the county made under Act 10 reforms did not completely make up for the lost revenue. But the county failed to take full advantage of Walker’s law. On balance, we rate Abele’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C49C780>],/factchecks/2012/may/28/chris-abele/abele-says-act-10-left-milwaukee-county-budget-mil/

Cory Booker claims Obama has overseen nation’s “lowest discretionary spending we’ve had in decades”
","
Newark Mayor Cory Booker drew national attention last week for criticizing a campaign ad from President Barack Obama, but even praising the president was problematic for the Brick City leader.

Before weighing in on the campaign ad, Booker argued May 20 in a roundtable discussion on NBC’s ""Meet The Press"" that Obama needs to remind Americans of his accomplishments, such as overseeing the lowest level of discretionary spending in decades.

""First of all, I think it’s a race for President Obama to remind the American public (of) the kind of things he’s been doing and stop letting the other side steal his narrative,"" said Booker, a Democrat and a representative for the Obama campaign. ""He’s a guy that’s cut taxes on small business, the lowest discretionary spending we’ve had in decades in the United States.""

It’s actually the other way around, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

As a percentage of gross domestic product -- which is a measure of the nation’s economy -- discretionary spending under Obama reached its highest level in about two decades, according to figures released by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget.

Discretionary spending is projected to drop to a level not seen at any point in the last several decades, but that would not occur for a few more years.

Booker spokeswoman Anne Torres acknowledged that the mayor’s statement was wrong.

""You’re correct,"" Torres told us. ""He misspoke.""

First, let’s explain discretionary spending.

There are two main categories of federal spending: discretionary and mandatory. Discretionary spending is controlled by lawmakers through annual appropriation acts. Mandatory spending is generally based on program parameters, such as those for Social Security and Medicare, without specific amounts being appropriated each year.

Discretionary spending represents nearly 40 percent of all federal outlays, and is comprised of defense and non-defense items.

Over the last decade, military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have largely contributed to the growth in defense spending, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Non-defense spending has increased during Obama’s tenure, in part, because of the stimulus bill he approved in February 2009, the budget office said.

Since Booker’s claim refers to discretionary spending in general, we’ll look at the total amount.

In fiscal year 2010 -- Obama’s first complete fiscal year as president -- discretionary spending hit 9.4 percent of GDP, marking the highest amount since fiscal year 1987. In fiscal year 2011, which ended last September, discretionary spending dropped to 9 percent.

Before fiscal years 2010 and 2011, discretionary spending had not reached 9 percent since fiscal year 1991.

In a deal to raise the nation’s debt ceiling, Obama and Congress agreed last summer to set caps on certain types of future discretionary spending. Due in large part to those caps, discretionary spending is projected to reach historic lows in the years ahead.

According to the White House, discretionary spending would fall to 5.9 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2016, marking the lowest level since at least the early 1960s. The Congressional Budget Office has offered slightly different estimates, placing discretionary spending at 6.5 percent in fiscal year 2016 and 5.9 percent in fiscal year 2019.

Our ruling

In his May 20 appearance on NBC’s ""Meet The Press,"" Booker cited a couple of Obama’s accomplishments, including ""the lowest discretionary spending we’ve had in decades in the United States.""

But during Obama’s tenure, discretionary spending hit 9 percent of GDP for the first time in about two decades. Discretionary spending is projected to drop significantly in the years ahead, but Booker made it sound like that had already occurred.

We rate the statement False.

"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Transportation', 'Bob Gibbs']","
Rep. Bob Gibbs touts water transportation for efficiency, safety and cost
","
Rep. Bob Gibbs is a big proponent of water transportation.

As chair of the House Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment (part of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure) he recently held a hearing on the soundness of the country’s inland waterway system, which includes the Ohio River.

Gibbs, a Republican from Holmes County, finds the system lacking. Deferred maintenance resulting from budget constraints on the U.S. Corps of Engineers increases the likelihood of a calamity befalling the system, he said at the April 18 hearing.

If improvements aren’t made, it could doom the country’s inland water system, he said, and that would be a costly bit of negligence because water transportation is a vital cog in our economy.

""Water transportation is the most fuel efficient, least polluting, safest, and least expensive means of moving cargo,""  he said.

That’s a pretty definitive statement. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out.

First of all, Gibbs was referring to inland waterways and their barge traffic that runs north and south along major navigable rivers, such as the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio.

River barges usually carry large volumes of low-value commodities, such as grain and coal. They compete to varying degrees with railroads and trucks, but more often than not they work in tandem. Ninety percent of all barge traffic depends on a connection with either rail or truck, said Chris Dager, research economist at the University of Tennessee.

Trillions of dollars of freight moves each year over the country’s transportation network, which includes 4 million miles of highways and roads, 140,000 miles of rail and 25,000 of commercially navigable waterways.

The problem with a blanket statement that any form of transportation is the cheapest or safest is that it can vary depending on the circumstances.

A commodities broker shipping corn from Iowa to New Orleans, for example, would send it by barge down the Mississippi, not by rail or truck. It will take longer to ship — the down river speed is about 9 mph — but cost far less. But if time is of the essence, or if a river with loading terminals isn’t handy, rail or truck may be the only feasible options.

Over-the-road delivery has a cost advantage at times because a trucker can drop off a load hundreds of miles away and usually find something to haul back on his return trip. That’s known as back-hauling and while it occurs usually 90 percent of the time with long-haul trucks, the rate is only 45 to 50 percent for barges, said Larry Bray, a research economist at University of Tennessee.

Railroads, on the other hand, usually return with empty cars, except for containers and boxcars.

And some areas of a river are more efficient than others. On the lower Mississippi River, barges move along unimpeded, but on the upper reaches they move more slowly because of multiple dams and locks.

And when it comes to delays, some rail and highway locations are legendary for their congestion.  

With all that in mind, let’s consider some numbers.

As of 2010, a river barge could transport an average of 640 tons of cargo per mile on a gallon of diesel, Dager said, thanks to recent improvements that include barges with deeper drafts and computer systems that provide up-to-the-minute profiles of a river bottom.

Railroads have made their own improvements, including larger railcars, better engines, and improved business modeling. They can now carry an average of 490 ton-miles of cargo per gallon of diesel, according to Dager.

Trucks are the least fuel efficient, with an average of 75-to-150 ton-miles per gallon of diesel, depending on how far they travel.

In addition, some social costs aren’t passed along to the consumer that need to be acknowledged. These include government subsidies for infrastructure (something trucks benefit from greatly, waterborne vessels to a much less extent, and railroads the least), congestion, and the effects on health and safety.

Those costs in the aggregate are highest for trucks, followed by rail and then water transportation, according to a 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office called ""Surface Freight Transportation: A Comparison of the costs of Road, Rail, and Waterways Freight Shipments That Are Not Passed on to Consumers.""

And then there’s this statement from Mitchell Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University’s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service: ""Water transportation is one of the most economical ways to move cargo, especially bulk cargo.""

While there are comparative advantages to each mode of transportation, Moss said, on average water is the least expensive and most fuel efficient.

So, it appears that Gibbs was correct when he said water transportation is the most fuel efficient way to move cargo, as well as the least expensive. He also said water transportation was the cleanest and safest way to move cargo. Those specific factors also are addressed in the GAO report.

The report states that trucks generate 238 pounds of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less per million ton-miles of freight delivered. That compares to 36 pounds for rail locomotives and 23 pounds for waterborne vessels.

Trucks also generate more than 6,000 pounds tons of nitrogen oxide per million ton-miles, compared with nearly 1,350 pounds for locomotives and about 938 pounds for waterborne vessels.

And when it comes to greenhouse gases, barges spew forth the least amount.

Finally, water transportation accounts for fewer accidents and injuries per ton-mile of delivered freight than trucks and rail, according to the GAO.

Gibbs said that water transportation is the cheapest, safest, cleanest and most fuel efficient way to move cargo. Clearly, it’s the most fuel efficient on average. It’s also safer and cleaner.

As for the expense, because barge traffic is so dependent on rail and trucking, those two modes of transportation could have an impact. But that said, the experts we talked to were persuasive that on average, water transportation is least expensive.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Gibbs’ statement rates True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3C5340>],/factchecks/2012/may/28/bob-gibbs/rep-bob-gibbs-touts-water-transportation-efficienc/

Christie backtracks on financing transportation projects
","
New Jersey’s governor often portrays himself as a man of his word.

Before taking office he vowed he wouldn’t raise taxes on millionaires and so far, he hasn’t. He’s also taken on the New Jersey Education Association by pledging to reform tenure and funding, infuriating numerous educators, administrators and legislators from Hackensack to Cape May.

So it might seem surprising that the governor known for slashing budgets, requiring public employees to contribute more to healthcare and pension costs, and putting a chokehold on various types of aid is changing his tune a bit on one of his major funding concerns: transportation. The change is inconsistent with past statements made by Christie so we’re putting that change to the Flip-O-Meter.

The Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It gauges whether they did.

Christie’s stance changed with Wednesday’s announcement that the administration will borrow an extra $260 million for transportation projects. That’s contrary to a Christie announcement more than a year ago that through his transportation capital plan, the state would begin relying less on borrowing for that type of work.

From a state Department of Transportation news release on Jan. 6, 2011: ""Today, we are continuing to put New Jersey on the path towards fiscal health and proposing a sensible and responsible plan that prioritizes vital transportation projects, while limiting the already-heavy debt burden carried by the taxpayers of our state.""

So what happened? Call it a miscalculation of sorts.

Both the Christie administration and David Rosen, chief budget officer for the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, are estimating revenue shortfalls in the budget that will ultimately mean Christie has less available cash to give to transportation. Christie’s revenue shortfall is $676 million through the end of the next fiscal year, while Rosen’s is $1.3 billion. That’s a difference of about $600 million between shortfall predictions.

Christie’s original transportation capital plan for FY 2012-2013 called for borrowing $986 million and using $260 million cash in 2013. Now, New Jersey will borrow the $260 million instead, increasing the total amount borrowed to $1.2 billion.

The $260 million in cash in addition to other cost-saving measures would help plug the revenue shortfall and allow the administration to kick off an across-the-board 10 percent income tax cut.

But Martin E. Robins, director emeritus of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University, told The Star-Ledger on Wednesday, ""We’re really falling right back into the capital financing that the governor critized Jon Corzine for.""

Despite the move to increase transportation borrowing, State Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff emphasized that the governor’s original goal to lessen reliance on bonding for transportation remains.

""This is a one-year initiative, and we do not make this recommendation casually,"" Sidamon-Eristoff said at an Assembly Budget Committee hearing Wednesday.

Our ruling

Christie has stated previously that he wants the state to rely less on borrowing for transportation projects and in January 2011 announced a transportation capital plan that calls for more pay-as-you-go financing. But now he’s saying the state will borrow an additional $260 million for transportation work next year in part because of projected revenue shortfalls in the state budget. The governor’s about-face is inconsistent with his previous statements, which rates the change a Half Flip on the Flip-O-Meter.

"['Tennessee', 'Taxes', 'Ron Ramsey']","
Tennessee Speaker Ramsey says Republicans delivered food-tax cut Democrats previously refused
","
The Tennessee Legislature last month approved a quarter-of-a-percentage point cut in the state sales tax on grocery food, effective July 1. It was part of a package of tax cuts that included a phased elimination of the estate tax by 2016 and elimination of the gift tax.

In a newsletter wrapping up the 107th General Assembly emailed on Friday, May 18, state Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey said, ""We gave every Tennessean tax relief by again reducing the food tax – reductions previous Democrat regimes refused to make.""

By referring to ""Democrat regimes,"" Ramsey was making a partisan statement that Republicans cut the sales tax on food and that Democrats had refused similar reductions in the past. But Ramsey – or his newsletter writer -- apparently has a short memory: the last reduction in Tennessee’s sales tax on grocery food was made in 2007 after it was proposed by legislative Democrats, who were still in the majority at the time, and signed into law by then-governor Phil Bredesen, a Democrat.

That cut in the state food tax from 6 to 5½ percent went into effect Jan. 1, 2008, when Ramsey was already speaker of the Senate. And it was double the food tax cut that Ramsey is now touting.

So, on its face, the claim flies in the face of basic facts, and a request for clarification to Ramsey’s office went unanswered.

But how about the credit Ramsey is taking?

Only last December, a cut on the sales tax on food was not on Ramsey’s wish list for the 2012 legislative session, and not only did he question the value of a cut on the sales tax on food, he also revealed that he had not been a proponent of the 2007 cut.

Ramsey hosted a press conference in his office on Dec. 15 to give reporters a preview of the upcoming legislative session. One question involved whether to cut the state sales tax on food, since Tennessee is one of only 11 states that still tax grocery food. He responded that since Tennessee has no income tax -- which he steadfastly opposes -- ""you have to have a reliable source of income to provide the basic services … . And so the sales tax on food is that reliable source.""

As for that 2007 cut, Ramsey said, ""I’ll bet you that if you poll the citizenry, there isn’t 5 percent that can tell you that when you walk into a grocery store and you buy some pork and beans, your tax is 5.5 percent from the state and if you reach right beside it and get a box of toilet paper, it’s 7 percent. So I think it’s more psychological than it is anything else. We’re never going to do away with it completely so I don’t think that lowering it really does help that much and I think we could concentrate more on the taxes that we can actually eliminate.""

A reporter asked: ""But weren’t you a big proponent of cutting it back a few years ago?""

Ramsey replied: ""Actually I wasn’t a big proponent to be perfectly honest. At that time, I tried to convince my caucus that the estate tax was the way to go. And we had a good discussion within our caucus on where we needed to go and I lost. And so I was always one at that time who thought we could take that same amount of money -- $45 million I think it was at that time – and use it for the estate tax as opposed to the sales tax on food and maybe I just didn’t fight hard enough at that time. So no, I was not a proponent at that time.""

Going back further in time, to 2002, it was legislative Democrats who successfully argued for exempting grocery food from the one-cent sales tax increase that the state legislature approved that year to end a 3½-year battle over state tax reform. Up until that time, the state taxed all food at precisely the same rate as it taxed other goods subject to the sales tax.
 
Finally, last month when the budget was about to pass the legislature, House Democrats proposed to use increased revenue that is now flowing into the state to double the food tax cut that Haslam had proposed, cutting it to 5 percent rather than 5-¼ percent. But Republicans, including Ramsey, opposed the deeper food tax cut.
 
Our ruling

A release from Ron Ramsey claimed credit for getting the sales tax on food reduced by a quarter-cent and said Democrats in the past had ""refused"" such cuts.

But it was Democrats who were primarily responsible for keeping the sales tax on food lower than the overall sales tax in the 2002 budget deal, and it was in fact a Democratic legislature and governor who pushed through a half-cent tax cut in 2007. Ramsey also is on the record as not being a proponent of cutting the sales tax on food.

Ramsey may or may not be right about how closely Tennesseeans follow the taxes on their pork and beans and toilet paper, but he’s wildly misleading on the history of who has favored cutting the state sales tax on food and who has not. We rate this claim Pants On Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1B7FC0>],/factchecks/2012/may/27/ron-ramsey/tennessee-speaker-ramsey-says-republicans-delivere/
"['Rhode Island', 'Elections', 'Legal Issues', 'Anastasia Williams']","
R.I. Rep. Anastasia Williams says two states -- Alabama and Massachusetts -- allow non-citizens who are living in those states legally to vote in state and local elections
","
Rep. Anastasia Williams went before the House Judiciary Committee May 16 to propose that Rhode Island voters be asked to approve an amendment to the state Constitution that would give voting rights to non-citizens who are legal residents. She said the Ocean State wouldn't be the first to do so.

""In 2011, Alabama and Massachusetts passed this legislation,"" she told the committee.

That statement surprised us. If non-citizens in Massachusetts were eligible to vote in state and local elections, we thought we would have heard about it.

We decided to investigate.

In her testimony, Williams said the intent of the proposal ""is to give every legal resident of the state of Rhode Island the opportunity to be properly represented"" when they are abiding by the law and paying taxes. She asserted that some elected officials won't help residents who aren't registered voters.

(She reported that her Cuban mother was a legal resident who declined to seek citizenship out of fear of losing her ties to her country of origin.)

Currently, only U.S. citizens can vote in federal, state and local elections in Rhode Island. Under the bill Williams supports, if voters amended the Constitution, legal permanent residents -- holders of the so-called ""green card"" -- would also be allowed to vote, after 30 days of residency.

When we called Williams, she said the information came from the General Assembly's Legislative Council, which aids in drafting and researching legislation.

House spokesman Larry Berman said the legislative research department made a mistake in a memo to Williams, with the wording suggesting that the proposals had become law in those states. They had not.

In the meantime, we spoke with Brian McNiff, spokesman for the Massachusetts secretary of state's office and Julie Sinclair, a lawyer with the elections division of the Alabama secretary of state's office. Both confirmed that only citizens can vote in their states and both said an amendment to the state Constitution would be required to change that.

Berman said the research that Williams relied upon from the General Assembly staff had been based on two bills, H-3430 in Massachusetts and SB-256 in Alabama.

We tracked them down.

The Massachusetts bill never got out of committee and called for permanent resident voting only in the town of Brookline.

The reference to the Alabama legislation, a broad immigration bill, is even less relevant. As introduced, it specifically said that only citizens should be allowed to vote, the opposite of how Williams represented it. It did not make any reference to giving voting rights to permanent legal residents. And when it passed the Senate, the reference to who should be allowed to vote had been removed.

So not only did the two pieces of legislation not become law, neither sought to give green-card holders the right to vote in statewide elections.

Our ruling

Rep. Anastasia Williams, advocating for her proposal to extend state and local voting rights to non-citizens who are permanent legal residents, told a House Judiciary Committee hearing, ""In 2011, Alabama and Massachusetts passed this legislation.""

Williams said, and House spokesman Larry Berman confirmed, that she was relying on information from the General Assembly's Legislative Council, which should be a reliable source.

In fact, the information Williams received was inaccurate. Neither state took such action.

""At the time I made this statement, I relied on the inaccurate information that was provided to me,"" Williams said in a comment released Thursday. ""This statement was not made intentionally.""

Said House Speaker Gordon Fox, ""It is unfortunate that Representative Williams was quoting inaccurate information provided to her by a staff person and I am addressing this issue internally."".

One last thought: we were surprised that a veteran legislator wasn't suspicious about the claim, given that Massachusetts is a neighbor and Alabama is known for having one of the nation's harshest laws against illegal immigrants.

We rate her statement False.

"['Education', 'Religion', 'Texas', 'Jeff Wentworth']","
Jeff Wentworth says he restored prayer and the pledge to Texas schools
","
In a TV ad, Republican state Sen. Jeff Wentworth’s campaign shows a woman assuring a friend in a coffee shop that Wentworth, who seeks re-election, is ""a solid conservative.""

She lists Wentworth accomplishments, including that ""he restored prayer and the pledge in our schools.""

We were curious about that claim, in part because voluntary student prayer has been protected, though a landmark 1962 U.S. Supreme Court decision barred school-organized prayer which it called a violation of the First Amendment.

In a telephone interview, Wentworth said his ad is based on his 2003 proposal, passed into law, giving students a regular opportunity to pray and requiring that they recite the U.S. pledge of allegiance and the pledge to the Texas flag.

The approved proposal requires students to recite the U.S. and Texas pledges of allegiance once each school day, to be followed by a one-minute moment of silence in which ""each student may, as the student chooses, reflect, pray, meditate or engage in any other silent activity that is not likely to interfere with or distract another student.""

The law also says that during the quiet time, school employees are to ""ensure that each of those students remains silent and does not act in a manner that is likely to interfere with or distract another student."" With a written request from a parent or guardian, the law says, a student can be excused from saying the pledges. There is no opt-out for the minute of silence.

Wentworth’s proposal made mandatory a moment of silence that had been optional under a 1995 law. That law did not explicitly mention prayer as something students could do during that time. But lawmakers in 1995 also added a section to the Texas Education Code stating: ""A public school student has an absolute right to individually, voluntarily, and silently pray or meditate in school in a manner that does not disrupt the instructional or other activities of the school.""

So, the measure authored by Wentworth resulted in students having daily minutes of silence, permitting prayer, and in their reciting the pledges.

But were both practices ""restored,"" as his ad says?

Certainly, Wentworth told us, in that his proposal was intended to restore customs he had appreciated growing up in San Antonio.

The 1962 court decision ended school prayer as he’d known it, he said, though no court decisions limited students from saying the pledges. Still, he said, constituents had come to him concerned their children were not saying the pledges; practices varied from school district to school district and school to school.  ""I decided it needed to be uniform and required across the state,"" he said.

We failed to pin how many schools were holding minutes of silence or already had students reciting either pledge before Wentworth acted. News accounts suggest, though, that the U.S. pledge was being recited in multiple schools and minutes of silence were occasionally observed.

An April 15, 2003, Houston Chronicle news article said the Houston school district and most area districts such as Fort Bend and Clear Creek allowed principals to determine whether students recited the pledge and observed a minute of silence.

The story also said:
** Students in all Pearland district schools recited the pledge to the Texas and U.S. flags daily.
** All 44 schools in the Conroe district daily recited the pledge (though the story did not specify which pledge).
** Most schools in the Katy district recited the pledge (also unspecified) and observed a minute of silence.

On April 24, 2003, the Chronicle reported that most schools in the Cypress-Fairbanks, Klein, Magnolia, Spring and Tomball districts reserved a time for students to recite the U.S. pledge. None observed a minute of silence on a regular basis. A May 8, 2003 Chronicle news story quoted Diane Jackson, the Spring Branch school district executive administrator for government engagement, policy and administration, saying that most of the district’s 45 schools already had students say the U.S. pledge, while some also observed a moment of silence.

An Aug. 4, 2003, El Paso Times news article reported that students in most El Paso County schools said the pledge of allegiance daily before the requirement was passed. Most did not observe a moment of silence, the story said.

A September 2, 2003, Dallas Morning News article said that in the area’s schools, many students had recited the pledge of allegiance for years, but the mandated moment of silence would be a change. The story quoted Rep. Dan Branch, R-Dallas and a House sponsor of the Wentworth measure, saying that the previous year, about half the elementary school students in Dallas County had regularly said the pledge, though hardly any students said the Texas pledge.

Debbie Ratcliffe, spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency, told us that the agency was not aware of any data collected on the pre-2003 prevalence of pledge recitations, though she believes it was common for students to say at least the U.S. pledge.

Joy Baskin, director of legal services for the Texas Association of School Boards, told us in a telephone interview that she did not know of research on earlier practices, but said she  thinks it was widespread for boards to require students to recite the U.S. pledge every day.

Wentworth said during the 2003 legislative session that the minute-of-silence requirement was not a move to bring organized prayer back into the classroom.  ""The goal is to instill loyalty and patriotism in public school students, and give them the opportunity to have 60 seconds of quiet at the beginning of the school day"" Wentworth was quoted as saying in an April 9, 2003, Dallas Morning News news article.

The story also quoted Wentworth as saying: ""It is not school prayer. The language of the bill is very clear about that. … It would not allow audible prayer.""

Sen. Juan Hinojosa, D-McAllen, objected during Senate debate of the bill, according to an April 10, 2003, San Antonio Express-News news article, and said: ""What you're doing is mandating prayer in schools."" The story says Wentworth disagreed, pointing to  language in the legislation statingl that students could use the minute to reflect, pray, meditate or engage in any other silent activity that's not distracting.

""This bill does not mandate prayer in public schools,"" Wentworth said, according to the article. ""Of course it does,"" Hinojosa said. ""Of course it doesn't,"" Wentworth said.

Wentworth told us that he that he made those comments to prevent his measure -- modeled on a Virginia law that passed court muster -- from potentially being construed as a violation of the 1962 Supreme Court ruling, not because he believed it did not allow students to pray. ""We’re talking about a very fine legal line,"" he said.

The Texas law survived a 2006 court challenge by a Dallas-area couple with three children attending school in the Carrollton-Farmers Branch district. In a lawsuit, the family said the required moment of silence violated the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment — ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.""

A Sept. 22, 2008, Austin American-Statesman news article, quoted David Croft, the father, as saying: ""It's clear if you watch the video and read the transcripts of the legislative debates that the main purpose of this law is to create school-sponsored silent prayer, and that with a wink and a nod they're just sort of calling it a moment of silence."" A 1985 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed moments of silence in public schools so long as the practice is motivated by a secular purpose, the Statesman article says.

In January 2008, the Statesman story says, U.S. District Judge Barbara Lynn found a nonreligious purpose for the quiet time, though she said that she had to hunt for it. ""The Texas Legislature was less than clear in articulating the secular purpose of the Texas moment of silence law,"" Lynn ruled, according to the article.

Still, the article says, Lynn was reassured by legislative debate indicating the silent time was meant to make schools ""more reflective and more reverent,"" prepare students for the ""seriousness of the day"" and create ""a common moment of preparation, deliberation and meditation.""

In 2009, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans upheld the lower court’s decision, saying the moment-of-silence law had a secular purpose.

In our interview, we asked Wentworth if it’s an overstatement to say he personally restored prayer and the pledge. He replied that while he was the author of the law and led the charge, many members were involved. ""All of this is a team sport,"" he said. ""Legislation is not passed by any one member of the House or the Senate.""

For perspective on the impact of the Texas law on students’ right to pray, we contacted Charles Haynes, a senior scholar at the First Amendment Center in Washington.

Haynes said by telephone: ""Of course, state and school-sponsored prayer remain unconstitutional. (Wentworth) couldn’t possibly be restoring state-sponsored prayer. And students’ freedom to pray has never been illegal; they are free to pray alone or in groups as long as they don’t disrupt or interfere with rights of others.""

Our ruling

Wentworth authored a measure mandating a daily chance for students to pray, though school-led or organized prayers like the ones of his youth remain unconstitutional. Also, Texas lawmakers affirmed the right of students to pray or meditate on their own nearly a decade earlier.

Aside from requiring students to be quiet for a minute, the Wentworth-originated law resulted in students reciting the pledge, as his ad says, though it seems like that had was already occurring in some schools.

Finally, Wentworth did not personally achieve the touted changes, though he was a key advocate.

Conservative PAC says Larry Taylor gave “in-state tuition to illegal immigrants”
","
Matt Welch, press secretary with Galveston County state Rep. Larry Taylor’s campaign for a Texas Senate seat, wrote PolitiFact Texas asking us to examine a statement posted on a website attacking his candidate.

The site created by the Conservative Voters of Texas PAC, www.whylarrywhy.com, blares in big type, ""Why did Larry Taylor give in-state tuition to illegal immigrants?"" Taylor is among three Republicans and a Democrat seeking to represent Senate District 11, southeast of Houston.

Mark McCaig, president of Conservative Voters of Texas and a Houston attorney, told us by phone that the PAC’s claim was based on passage of Senate Bill 1528 in 2005.

""The current law that allows illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition was voted for -- was supported by Larry Taylor,"" he said.

The PAC’s website urges readers to send a letter to Taylor saying, ""Because of your vote on SB 1528 (79th Regular Session), children of illegal immigrants are allowed to attend state schools with in-state tuition.""

We have previously reported that Texas became the first state to offer the in-state tuition benefit to children of illegal immigrants in 2001 -- or two years before Taylor joined the House. In 2001, only five legislators voted against House Bill 1403, which Gov. Rick Perry signed into law that June.

McCaig conceded that the 2001 law created the in-state tuition benefit. He said, however, that the 2005 measure backed by Taylor replaced the 2001 law while preserving the in-state tuition benefit. Hence, he said, Taylor voted to give that benefit.

Taylor disagreed, saying by phone that the option he voted on was not to discontinue or continue giving in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, but to tighten restrictions or ""leave it the way it is."" Given that choice, he said, he and other representatives present voted unanimously to pass SB 1528.

Legislative records confirm that House members unanimously approved the proposal, though one legislator recorded his ""no"" vote in the House Journal. State senators also unanimously endorsed the legislation.

At the time, lawmakers said they were changing definitions in law to ensure that applicants to colleges and universities were treated fairly in determinations of residency.

At McCaig’s nudging, however, we noticed the 2005 proposal repealed the 2001 language enabling illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition. But the latter proposal also swapped in similar provisions.

In a telephone interview,  Dominic Chavez, a spokesman for the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, said the 2005 proposal covered several topics related to residency issues and tuition. Chavez said the revisions were intended to ensure that other legal U.S. residents had the same access to in-state tuition earlier made possible for illegal immigrants.

For example, he said, a student who earned a Texas high school diploma while living here with his grandmother could be denied in-state tuition rates if his ""domicile"" was determined to be with a parent in another state.

Did the 2005 law tighten restrictions on who could qualify, as Taylor says? Chavez said, ""I’m not sure we could prove it one way or the other.""

Broadly, Chavez told us, SB 1528 ""was not designed to repeal or not repeal"" the 2001 law. ""A vote against SB 1528 did not equate to a vote to repeal HB 1403,"" he said. Put another way, he said, the coordinating board traces creation of the tuition benefit for illegal immigrants to the action in 2001.

Welch, Taylor’s consultant, pointed out by phone that various conservative Republicans including Reps. Leo Berman, Ken Paxton and Wayne Christian voted, like Taylor, for the 2005 proposal. He said this was an indication that no one thought they were voting to give in-state tuition to illegal immigrants.

Asked for comment on our findings, McCaig said that SB 1528 constituted a renewal of the tuition benefit because its definitions replaced all the definitions in HB 1403.

Our ruling

The PAC says Taylor voted to give in-state tuition to illegal immigrants.

However, Texas lawmakers granted illegal immigrants the chance to pay in-state college tuition rates in 2001.

It’s correct that the cited 2005 action revised the 2001 law, partly to benefit legal U.S. residents. But these changes did not give or create the tuition benefit. If lawmakers had simply rejected the 2005 proposal, for instance, the tuition benefit would have stayed in place. It was years old.

This claim depicts a vote on a measure crafted for limited purposes as if it were a vote to launch the state’s in-state tuition benefit. That’s tricky reasoning -- and ridiculous.

"['Oregon', 'City Government', 'Jefferson Smith']","
Does Portland employ one manager for every six non-managers?
","
Middle management never seems to get much love. In 2011, the state Legislature passed a law that sets a goal of 11 staffers for every manager working for the state. Of course, there are exceptions depending on the work being done, but the consensus was the state needs fewer managers and more people on the ground.

Portland mayoral candidate and House member Jefferson Smith referenced this law in a questionnaire for Oregon Stand for Children, an education lobbying group. When the group asked him what he would do to cut down on expenses, he said he’d address the manager-to-employee ratio (or span of control as it’s known) at the city level.

Here’s his full remark: ""Our front-line workers providing direct services are bearing too much of the brunt. I carried HB 2020 on the House floor to set a goal of 11 front-line staff for every 1 manager. The City Auditor reports in Portland it’s 6 to 1.  I’ll keep an eye on the middle management costs. As a signal to the importance of fiscal prudence, as well as a way to save some money, I will have a smaller staff in the Mayor’s office.""

We were familiar enough with the statewide legislation to know he was speaking the truth there, but we were less sure about his figures for Portland. Is the city’s span of control really half that of state government’s goal? We wanted to know.

Our first stop -- since Smith provided his source in the comment -- was to the Auditor’s Office at the city of Portland. As luck would have it, the office had released a report on this very subject back in August 2011. We flipped through it and found a very helpful table that laid out of the span of control for each bureau.

The report presents a pretty staggering range. Parks and Recreation has a span of control of one manager for every 30 non-managers. Meanwhile, Fire and Rescue is at a one-to-five ratio. The one snag with the report, however, is that it never gives an overall span of control for the entire city. We called the office to see if it might have that information even if it didn’t include it in the report, but we didn’t have much luck.

Drummond Kahn, the director of audit services, said the report was a follow-up to an earlier study and wasn’t concerned with a citywide estimate. What’s more, he wasn’t sure it would mean much in the aggregate. Different tasks, he said, require different spans of control. This theory is laid out in the report, too. Generally, the idea is that the more complicated a task is, the more management you need and vice versa. Because the city does a variety of different tasks, the ratio varies dramatically and an overall number wouldn’t reveal much.

He suggested we follow up with the Bureau of Human Resources. We spoke with a few people there in various offices, but none of them was able to get us the aggregate number we were looking for to corroborate Smith’s claim.

Our next step was to inquire about a basic breakdown of the number of managers and non-managers employed by the city, but -- much to our surprise -- nobody at the city seems to keep track of such things in the aggregate.

Next, we called Smith. Where’d he get his citywide number if not from the auditor? Smith’s campaign manager, Stacey Dycus, said Smith had actually gotten his figures from AFSCME. She sent us the union’s math, which showed that there were 1,020 supervisors and 6,216 non-supervisory employees (these are are full-time equivalents so we’re not talking bodies,  we’re talking full-time positions). If you do the math (1,020 into 6,216) you get the 6-to-1 ratio Smith had mentioned.

We called AFSCME to see where it got the figures but ultimately never got our hands on them. So, we decided to do some of our own back-of-the-envelope math.

Thanks to the auditor’s report, we had the span of control for each city bureau. We gave a call to Andrew Scott, who manages the City’s Financial Planning Division, and asked for the number of full-time equivalents at each bureau. He pointed us to a budget document online and we started putting all the data in a spreadsheet. Now, our math wasn’t exact and probably doesn’t account for everybody, but our numbers were close to what the union had given Smith -- and so was our ultimate aggregate span of control: 5.96 employees for every manager.

As many folks at the city pointed out as we did this research, that number is pretty useless. You wouldn’t want to make a citywide proclamation that the span of control should be a certain ratio. It’s much more effective if you look at it bureau by bureau.

But Smith knows that -- and has generally been careful to say as much in his public remarks on this sort of thing. Anyhow, the data backs Smith up. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B8FFC0>],/factchecks/2012/may/25/jefferson-smith/does-portland-employee-one-manager-every-six-non-m/

Bernie Sanders, Chuck Todd debate crime bill vote, assault weapons ban
","Bernie Sanders defended his vote supporting the 1994 crime bill during an interview on Meet the Press. Both he and Hillary Clinton have been criticized for their support of the legislation, which some say helped usher in the era of mass incarceration and decimate black communities. Sanders has pushed back, saying he only voted for the bill because of key safety provisions. The Sanders campaign offered the defense when we asked about it in September and in a recent press release. But that doesn’t add up, Meet the Press’ Chuck Todd pointed out on Feb. 28. ""You said you supported the House version of crime bill because it had an assault weapons ban in it. But that turned out not to be the case,"" Todd said. ""So why did you put out a statement that was misleading?"" ""Woah, woah, woah,"" Sanders responded. ""No, that’s not my understanding. My understanding is there is a ban on assault weapons in that bill."" ""It was not in the House bill that you voted. It was in a Senate bill, but not the House bill,"" Todd countered. ""Hold it. To the best of my knowledge, there were two important provisions, and that is the Violence Against Women Act,"" Sanders said. ""And my understanding is there is a ban on assault weapons."" So who’s right here? The answer is complicated. Sanders did vote in favor of a House conference report that included the aforementioned ban and protections for women. He also voted for a separate House bill specifically prohibiting assault weapons that was meant to be folded into the omnibus legislation. But it’s a stretch to say that Sanders supported the crime bill because of the assault weapons ban, so Todd is right that Sanders also okayed versions without the prohibitions. Sanders and the crime bill The crime bill underwent many iterations before it became law in August 1994. So it’s not entirely clear if Sanders and Todd are talking about the same version. But here’s the bottom line. Sanders voted for at least one version of the bill that didn’t include the assault weapons ban -- undercutting his core claim. The crime bill had a circuitous path. In 1991, Sanders opposed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1991 — an early version of the 1994 bill put forth by Jack Brooks, a Democrat from Texas and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Though the bill passed in the House, it ultimately failed in the Senate. In October 1993, Brooks tried again and introduced the original Violent Crime and Control Law Enforcement Act of 1994. This version didn’t include an assault weapons ban nor protections for women. It passed in the House by a voice vote on Nov. 3, 1993, so it’s unclear whether Sanders voted in favor. We found no evidence Sanders opposed the bill, and in three roll call votes, Sanders, along with most Democrats, said ""aye"" to amendments that didn’t include a ban. When the bill reached the Senate, it added provisions to ban assault weapons and protect women from crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence. This version passed in the Senate and returned to the House. At that point, two things happened. First, Sanders criticized the crime bill for its lack of attention to root causes. ""We can either educate or electrocute. We can create meaningful jobs, rebuilding our society, or we can build more jails. Mr. Speaker, let us create a society of hope and compassion, not one of hate and vengeance,"" he said on the House floor on April 13. Second, Brooks amended the bill again, this time stripping the legislation of the assault weapons ban but keeping the violence against women provisions. Sanders voted for the bill without the gun ban. In place of the ban, Brooks offered to create a commission to ""examine the extent to which assault weapons and high power firearms have contributed to violence and murder in the United States."" Then the bill went back and forth between the two chambers for a few months, as a conference committee attempted to hash out the differences. Meanwhile, the assault weapons ban became a hot topic in the national debate, with three former presidents — Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan — writing a letter urging Congress to pass it. In May, Sanders voted for a separate bill put forth by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer to ban 19 semi-automatic assault weapons, including AK-47s and Uzis as well as weapons with more than one assault feature. According to news reports from the time, passing this legislation paved the way for the compromise bill to encompass the ban. Brooks, the Texas Democrat described by the Washington Post as ""wily and contrary,"" attempted to keep the prohibitions out of the bill but to no avail. The House released its conference report in August 1994 with the ban in place. Sanders voted in agreement.   Sanders on banning assault weapons Outside of the omnibus crime bill, the record shows that Sanders supported prohibiting assault weapons since his early days in office. In 1990, the Miami Herald noted that Sanders had earned the backing of the gun community in his congressional bid over Republican Peter Smith, even though ""Sanders also supports federal limits on assault weapons."" But in 1994, his vote on the Schumer bill roused the ire of Vermont gun owners. Here’s a passage from the Boston Globe to that point: ""Sanders, who always supported an assault weapons ban, joined Swett and Andrews in the 216-214 House majority to ban 19 types of semiautomatic guns — which require the trigger to be pulled each time the gun is fired but have high rates of fire and magazines that hold more than 10 cartridges. ‘We're going to put our complete and entire effort to unseat him,’ said Douglas Hoffman, president of a pro-gun group, the Sportsman's Alliance for Vermont's Environment, of Sanders."" In 1996, Sanders reconfirmed his support of the ban, voting to reject its appeal. Our ruling Sanders says he voted for the 1994 crime bill because ""there is a ban on assault weapons in that bill."" There were many votes surrounding the crime bill. The trouble with Sanders’ claim is that his contention that he voted for the crime bill because of the assault weapons ban is at odds with votes for the bill that include no such ban. As often with congressional votes, there is a lot of gray area to determining a legislator’s motivations. We rate Sanders’ claim Half True.   Says he supported the 1994 crime bill because ""there is a ban on assault weapons in that bill.""  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097061D80>],/factchecks/2016/feb/28/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-chuck-todd-debate-crime-bill-vote-a/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry claims Donald Trump's wall on the Southwest border will take years to complete
","Donald Trump says part of the answer to the complicated question of immigration has a seemingly simple solution: Build a ""great, great"" wall along the southern border and make neighboring Mexico pay for it. The logistics of that idea leave many people, including former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, agog.  ""Building a wall"" on the border ""will take literally years. I don’t care how good of a builder you are,"" Perry said about 40 minutes into an interview on the Jan. 15, 2016, edition of the Simon Conway Show on WHO in Des Moines. ""And plus the private property rights,"" Perry said. ""This is an issue that really gets complex in a hurry. I know because I’ve had to deal with it."" Perry’s assertion got us thinking, what would go into building a wall from southernmost California to the southern tip of Texas? And would Trump’s wall indeed take years to build? We didn’t take Perry’s claim as an uncheckable prediction in that when he spoke, there already existed exhaustive studies and reports on building a border fence as ordered by Congress in 2006, particularly those conducted by the General Accounting Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress. We failed to connect with Trump’s camp about this statement while a Perry spokesman, Stan Gerdes, said by phone that while the former governor didn’t send a crew to the border to estimate how long a wall would take to build, it’s Perry’s experience-rich opinion it would definitely take more than a year. Some assumptions Before assessing Perry’s claim, we have to make assumptions in part because Trump’s plan for the wall is pretty vague. We’re also going to share declarations by Trump and others that occurred after Perry spoke. Typically, we wouldn’t do so out of fairness to the person making a claim. But not doing so here might leave us short of being up to date. What we know of late is that Trump told MSNBC on Feb. 9, 2016 the wall would be a ""real wall,"" likely 35 to 40 feet tall and 1,000 miles long. The U.S.-Mexico border is actually just less than 2,000 miles long, but Trump said there are natural barriers over a portion of the border, meaning the U.S. would only need a wall along 1,000 miles of it. Some perspective: A 1,000-mile wall would be about one-13th the length of the Great Wall of China, but more than twice the proposed length of the concrete and fence barrier that separates Israel from the West Bank, according to a Nov. 11, 2014 Washington Post news article. Trump has also conceded the wall will cost billions. He’s been quoted saying costs will total up to about $8 billion, all out of Mexico’s pocketbook. At the Feb. 25, 2016, GOP debate, he upped that speculated price tag to $10 billion to $12 billion. Former Mexican President Felipe Calderón opposes Trump’s idea, according to a Feb. 8, 2016 CNN news article, where Calderon called Trump’s wall ""stupid,"" as does former Mexican President Vicente Fox, who said in a Univision interview posted online Feb. 25, 2016 that Mexico is ""not going to pay for that f****** wall."" Trump’s response to Fox’s declaration? ""The wall just got 10 feet taller,"" he said at the Republican presidential debate in Houston the same day.   In August 2015, Trump told New Hampshire residents the wall would be made using ""beautiful nice precast plank"" (see the video above this story). So we know it’s going to be a solid wall. And if Trump becomes president, is it feasible to have a wall up in a year or less? The existing fence There’s currently about 670 miles of fencing along the 1,954-mile U.S.-Mexico border. That is, the fence is not a fluid structure from point A to point B. Rather, it’s a fragmented barrier of metal posts and fencing standing about 18-feet tall, according to a Jan. 1, 2016, Associated Press news article. When he was governor and running for president the first time, Perry voiced opposition to the fence, expressing a sentiment perhaps echoed in his skepticism about Trump’s promised wall. ""No, I don’t support a fence on the border,"" Perry said in New Hampshire, according to a Sept. 3, 2011 news story in the Dallas Morning News. ""The fact is, it’s 1,200 miles from Brownsville to El Paso. Two things: How long you think it would take to build that? And then if you build a 30-foot wall from El Paso to Brownsville, the 35-foot ladder business gets real good."" Earlier, the fence was started as a result of the 2006 Secure Fence Act, which approved the construction of an about 700-mile fence stretching from parts of Tecate, California to Brownsville. Five years later, President Barack Obama said the fence is ""now basically complete"" – a claim PolitiFact deemed Mostly False on May 16, 2011. Around that time, the vast majority of the mandated fencing had been answered with vehicle barriers and single-layer pedestrian fence even while the act called for  double-layer fencing, of which there was about 36 miles in place. As of 2012, the fence and fence-related costs totaled about $6 billion. A 2009 Government Accountability Office report said that on average, the cost had run between $1 million and $3.9 million per mile of fence, depending on things like ""type of fencing, topography, materials used, land acquisition costs, and labor costs."" Raul Meza, a structural engineer and El Paso’s state director for the Structural Engineer’s Association of Texas, who lives about four miles from a portion of the border fence, told us by phone he thinks a wall would be even more expensive to build because it requires more time and labor. In January 2016, PolitiFact Florida found estimates for the wall’s cost ranging from $5.1 billion to $25 billion, with additional costs for maintenance. There’s been little announced in terms of a timeline for the wall’s construction. Trump told Meet the Press on Aug. 15, 2016 construction would be ""under budget and ahead of schedule.""  Constructing Trump’s wall By telephone, Sharon Wood, dean of the University of Texas’ Cockrell School of Engineering and a former chair of UT’s civil engineering department, told us a wall, like the one Trump is suggesting, would likely be made using steel-reinforced concrete. ""You can buy small reinforcement bars if you just go to Home Depot… Obviously for a larger structure, you’re going to use larger sizes,"" Wood said. ""You don't buy it from Home Depot, but it’s the same type of process."" A Feb. 17, 2016, CNN news article backs up this idea. Engineers asked to speculate about the envisioned project suggested precast concrete panels reinforced with steel would likely be used. They also came to the conclusion that building the wall would take around 339 million cubic feet of concrete and 5 billion pounds of steel. Meza told us two ways to build a reinforced concrete wall would entail either building it along the border on site, or building concrete panels at different construction firms -- which Trump seemed to endorse in his August 2015 remarks -- and having the panels transported and installed. Meza said precast panels would save time but add to the bill due to transport costs. Yet there’s more to building a large project than outright construction. James Jirsa, a UT-Austin civil engineering professor who specializes in concrete structures, told us there’s usually a planning period, lasting at least a year, to survey terrain and settle design issues. That period, he said, is followed by a bidding period for land that can also be time-consuming. The federal government has the right to build on private property when it deems projects a public necessity, though it is required to offer compensation – a process, celebrated by Trump, called eminent domain. This part of pre-construction can take years, depending on whether or not landowners dispute it. ""Every piece of land is different,"" said Paul Barkhurst, an eminent domain litigation lawyer based in San Antonio. ""You’re talking about a massive project across many, many states. It just depends on how much resources they want to put on it. One case could drag on for years because the land owner can challenge the right to take and the landowner can challenge the amount of compensation."" Wood said an environmental impact and hydrological study may also be necessary, to see how the wall would affect nearby water and the flow in the Rio Grande. Then comes the raw building of the wall. Wood said there aren’t many structural loads to consider, but the builders would have to find a way to make sure the foundation is solid, even if the Rio Grande floods. This involves digging out the foundation and putting in casts of the concrete foundation and then building. ""To be honest, that’s pretty straightforward,"" Wood said, saying the excavation of the foundation would probably take the most time. So how long would it take?  Wood said that when just looking at the building the wall, pre-construction steps aside, it’s possible though highly unlikely that the wall could be completed in a year, say, if it were a ""national priority and all of the resources were put in one place."" If ""you were to mobilize every single construction worker in the country,"" Wood said, ""and take them down to the Texas border, I bet they could get it done very quickly."" Separately, Jirsa opined that he and most engineers would probably agree that such a wall could not be built in under a year while Meza said the time it takes to build the avowed wall hinges largely on how much money goes toward construction. If money were no object, he said, the best-case scenario from the initial design phase to the wall’s completion would be five to 10 years. ""I think that would be reasonable,"" he speculated. Our Ruling Perry said: ""Building a wall"" on the U.S.-Mexico border ""will take literally years."" If Trump has a fast-track plan to plan the wall, purchase required land, complete needed studies and erect the wall in a year or less, it’s not public. Meantime, engineering experts agree the wall would most likely take years to complete. Keep in mind, too, it took more than six years to build roughly 700 miles of fence and barriers along the roughly 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. We rate this speculative claim True.

"['Candidate Biography', 'County Budget', 'Texas', 'Jason Nassour']","
Challenger levels Mostly False claim about Gerald Daugherty voting to hike his salary 19.6 percent
","With early voting in motion, Travis County Precinct 3 Commissioner candidate Jason Nassour charged his Republican primary opponent, incumbent Gerald Daugherty, with hypocritically voting himself a fat pay raise. ""Your current county commissioner claims to have taken a pay cut, but for 2016, he voted to raise his salary by 19.6 percent,"" Nassour said on Facebook Feb. 18, 2016.              SOURCE: Facebook post, Jason Nassour, Feb. 18, 2016 (screenshot Feb. 26, 2016) The first part of Nassour’s claim points to Daugherty touting his own fiscal frugality. On Daugherty’s campaign website, for instance, he says he has ""taken an 8 percent pay decrease in each of the nine years he has been in office."" That’s nine years in two chunks: Daugherty, a businessman, recaptured the seat representing western Travis County on the five-person commissioners court in 2012 after losing the spot in 2008. The other seats, including the county judge’s post, are held by Democrats. Nassour’s backup We asked Nassour, an Austin attorney, where he got his number for Daugherty’s vote for a steep salary increase. Nassour pointed us to a screenshot on his campaign Facebook page showing a portion of a Travis County budget document laying out the salary and benefits of the Precinct 3 commissioner in the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years and as proposed for the fiscal 2016 budget. By phone, Nassour said: ""I took this right off the county website. I’ll be the first one to come out and say I’m wrong, but I’m in the business of looking at what’s on paper."" The provided screenshot indicates $82,600 was to be spent on the Precinct 3 commissioner’s salary in 2015 and in the column for the fiscal 2016 proposed budget, the budgeted salary for the commissioner is $101,417, seemingly suggesting an even greater, 23 percent, surge than what Nassour declared. By phone, Nassour said he got the lower 19.6 percent figure by dividing $82,600 by $101,417 and subtracting the result from 1. Our sense: That’s not how to calculate the percentage difference (and by Nassour’s approach, we reached a different result, 18.6). County records To get a fix on the relevant figures, we turned to county records where we couldn’t find the $82,600 salary for 2015 in posted budget documents. On the county’s website, that is, the relevant document lists the Precinct 3 commissioner salary in 2015 as $90,109, identical to what the county spent on the salary the year before. To our request for clarification, Travis Gatlin, the county’s budget director, said it looked like Nassour compared actual amounts spent in 2014 and 2015 to the amount budgeted for the commissioner’s salary in 2016. His point: Actual amounts spent can be less than what the county budgets at the start of a fiscal year. By phone, Gatlin also said Nassour’s source documents appeared to be out of date. While the finalized budget was posted once approved at the end of September 2015, figures showing actual spending in 2015 were updated in mid-December 2015, Gatlin said, after expenditures were finalized for the fiscal year, which ran through September 2015, and all payroll information had been  filed. The amount budgeted  for each of the four county commissioner salaries in fiscal 2015, for instance, was $98,463. But in the 12 months, the county paid $90,109 for Daugherty’s salary, according to the budget’s 2015 actual expenditures data when we looked in late February 2016. Daugherty’s proclaimed lower pay So, take what Daugherty took in pay in 2015 and that breaks out to about 8 percent less than the budgeted base salary for each commissioner that year--as Daugherty says on his campaign website. But that’s not the full picture. After Daugherty rejoined the body in 2013, he accepted a salary of $90,109 for fiscal 2013, according to his signed affidavit. At the time, that was about 5.7 percent less (not 8 percent less) than the budgeted salary for each commissioner. In September 2015, most recently, Daugherty signed an affidavit saying he would take a salary of $93,000 in fiscal 2016, which was up $2,891, 3.2 percent, from what he took in pay for 2015. (If he had accepted the authorized $101,417, his pay would have increased nearly 13 percent, we calculate.) Daugherty’s vote Even if Daugherty didn’t take all of the higher base salary, did he vote for increasing it? When the commissioners began to consider raising their base salaries from $98,463 to $101,417, Daugherty voted against beginning the process of approving 3 percent raises for most county elected officials, according to the minutes of the body’s Aug. 11, 2015 meeting. An Austin American-Statesman news story published about the decisive meeting quotes Daugherty saying he thought the commissioners ""ought to try to lead by example in elected officials,"" adding he would prefer if elected officials were required to ask the county for raises rather than garnering across-the-board salary increases. Records show, further, that Daugherty was absent from the Sept. 1, 2015, meeting at which the commissioners court set each commissioner’s 2016 salary at $101,417. Later, though, Daugherty joined his colleagues in voting for adoption of the full 2016 county budget, including the salary changes, at the body’s Sept. 29, 2015 meeting, according to meeting minutes. ""When you vote for the budget, at the end it’s sort of a formality,"" Daugherty told us by phone. ""The budget is done at that stage … It’s one of our responsibilities, and that happens every year. You don’t vote against the budget because there’s one thing you voted against."" We shared the figures we found with Nassour, who said by phone that he believes he was misled by budget information posted by the county in September 2015. With regards to Daugherty’s reasoning on his vote for approval of the budget, Nassour said, ""If you vote for the budget, you vote for what’s in it. I know that’s hard, because when you’re looking at the budget you’re looking at a lot … If there are things in the budget I don’t approve of, it’s my job not to vote for it"" or ""say I stand by it."" Our ruling Nassour said Daugherty ""claims to have taken a pay cut, but for 2016, he voted to raise his salary by 19.6 percent."" It looks to us like Daugherty initially opposed certain pay raises for 2016 including those penciled in for commissioners. Still, he later voted for the budget including the raises. However, he personally set his own increased salary at an amount some $8,400 less than the newly authorized salary for commissioners. His pay went up 3.2 percent, not nearly 20 percent. We rate this claim Mostly False.

"['Abortion', 'Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Blake Rocap']","
Candidate claim to stopping Republicans on abortion overlooks that Republicans mostly prevailed
","A Democratic aspirant for the Texas House seat to be relinquished by Elliott Naishtat of Austin presents himself as so much of a legislative pro, he stopped extremists from taking abortion rights. A Blake Rocap mailer presents this message: ""When Republican extremists tried to take away abortion rights … Blake Rocap stopped them."" On the flip side, the mailer says Rocap has 10 years of experience protecting abortion rights with key groups and ""stood up to Republicans… and won,"" even proving the architect of state Sen. Wendy Davis’s 2013 filibuster ending a legislative session without abortion legislation advancing into law. Let’s be clear: Texas hasn’t outlawed abortion, which would surely run afoul of the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling that established a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. But Texas Republicans have made an abortion harder to get. From 2009 through 2013, measures passed into law barring state aid to Planned Parenthood programs connected to abortion providers; requiring physicians to take sonograms before abortions; barring third-trimester abortions; requiring physicians who provide abortions to have admission privileges at nearby hospitals; and mandating clinics that provide abortions to meet hospital-like surgical standards; that law awaits Supreme Court review. Also, the ""pro-choice"" filibuster by Davis in 2013 was arguably nulled after the Republican governor, Rick Perry, called another session during which the Republican majority passed the Davis-opposed restrictions into law. Rocap’s backup So we asked Rocap, an Austin lawyer, about the basis of his claim to have stopped Republicans. By phone and email, he said he was referring to his work since 2009 as an advocate and strategist, first for NARAL Pro-Choice Texas and later for the ACLU of Texas. Each group, Rocap said, hired him to stop such legislation -- and he did. Rocap said: -- In 2011, House Bill 2555 ""would have drastically changed the process for minors to access an abortion and removed the option of a judicial bypass.  As a volunteer attorney who represents abused teens I had intimate knowledge of the real-life situations that some teens encounter.  I also am an expert in the statutory provisions and their history and was able to educate the members and their staff how the current law came to be, the several different provisions which would have remained un-amended in the bill that presented a constitutional problem and the real world problem for teens in Texas. The bill was not voted out of committee and was stopped."" Legislative records show HB 2555 didn’t advance. The witness list for an April 2011 hearing on the proposal lists Rocap, for NARAL, as the person testifying against approval. Then again, Joe Pojman of the Texas Alliance for Life, an anti-abortion group, was among individuals registering in opposition. By email, Pojman told us the alliance opposed a provision in the legislation repealing written parental consent for minors to receive abortions. Pojman opined: ""I do not think Blake had any effect at all on killing that bill. At least I was not aware that he had any effect."" --In 2013, Rocap said, HB 997 would have banned abortion from being covered by insurance policies. ""I testified against the bill and had specific conversations with members who told me that my testimony was impressive and would likely keep the bill from passing. The bill did not pass. A bill attempting to ban abortion coverage in insurance has been filed every session since 2011. I have through various efforts tried to stop them as part of my work, none have passed."" Legislative records show HB 997 cleared a House panel but didn’t make it to the full House. The witness list for a March 2013 hearing lists Rocap, for NARAL, among four people to testify against the proposal; two people registered in opposition. --In 2013, HB 2308 ""would have imposed difficult reporting requirements on physicians and imposed penalties,"" Rocap said. ""I testified against the bill and tried to work with the bill’s author to reach an acceptable compromise. When we could not reach a compromise, I alerted the committee members and chair and the bill was not voted out. Our coalition of pro-choice lobbyists assigned me to work on this bill, I did, and the bill was stopped."" The proposal died in a House committee, records show. A witness list lists Rocap, for NARAL, as the sole person to testify against approval; 25 others registered in opposition. The proposal’s author, Rep. Matt Schaefer, R-Tyler, told us in a statement emailed by his office that he blamed Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, chairman of the House State Affairs Committee, for the measure not advancing. Cook didn’t respond to a request for an interview. Rocap stood by his characterization of what happened. Generally, Rocap told us, he ""worked on stopping every abortion bill since 2009 (four regular legislative sessions and their special sessions)"" or ""approximately 130 bills or proposed constitutional amendments"" from 2009 through 2013 by writing amendments and questions and points of order to help House Democrats slow and stop measures. Those stops included, Rocap said, Senate Bill 182, a 2009 proposal to require that a pregnant woman undergo an obstetric ultrasound before obtaining an abortion. The legislation cleared the Senate and a House panel, records show, but wasn’t voted on in the full House. But such a mandate passed into law in 2011. HB 15 held that in most cases a sonogram be performed on the pregnant woman at least 24 hours before the abortion. Rocap commented by email: ""I think you’ll agree that this doesn’t mean the effort in 2009 did not stop the bill. If OU beats Texas this coming fall, it doesn’t mean Texas didn’t win last year. That success in 2009 meant greater access to abortion for Texans for the approximately two-year time period before the bill that passed in 2011 eventually went into effect."" Rocap said that in 2011 he stopped HB 2828, offered as an effort to ensure ""that the pregnant woman's choice to have or seek an abortion is not the result of coercion or force,"" by working within the rules of the agenda-setting House Calendars Committee so it didn’t reach the floor in time to pass. Legislative records show the proposal was sent to the panel April 19, 2011 and members placed it on the House calendar weeks later, on May 9, 2011. And in 2013, Rocap said, he made sure the Texas Senate lacked sufficient votes to advance any of four anti-abortion proposals ultimately killed, for that session, by the Davis filibuster. (Davis did not reply to our emailed inquiry about Rocap’s role.) Asked to elaborate on what he did, Rocap said: ""Those bills needed 2/3rds of the Senate to agree to bring them up. Part of my work involved making sure these bills did not get the necessary votes to proceed, by pursuing a number of tactics and strategies, generally known as lobbying, including confidential conversations, which I and others believe directly contributed to the failure of the bills."" He agreed the same proposals subsequently made it into law. ""I don’t believe that just because we eventually lost on one set of bills, that means all other successes and efforts are not significant, or did not happen,"" Rocap wrote. By email, Rocap further noted a May 2013 House resolution stating he was stepping down as NARAL’s Texas legislative counsel, ""drawing to a close five years of steadfast service in defense of the reproductive rights of Texas women."" Other ‘pro-choice’ voices Rocap suggested we confirm his claim by contacting Heather Busby, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, plus a Democratic House member, Jessica Farrar of Houston, among authorities. To our inquiries, both described Rocap as pivotal to slowing Republican pushes for abortion restrictions. By email, Busby called Rocap’s claim factual, writing: ""Blake was our legislative counsel over a number of sessions and his work behind the scenes was instrumental in stopping bad legislation from passing. He was probably the sole reason anti-choice bills that were introduced during the regular session in 2013 never moved, and that is just one example. He was instrumental in devising the strategy that made Sen. Davis' filibuster possible."" We requested more detail from Busby, who noted by phone that lobbying entails meetings that aren’t public; there aren’t ""minutes"" to pass along, she said. Asked if Rocap singlehandedly stopped Republicans on abortion, Busby replied: ""If you want to explain how lobbying works, if you want to give full context, obviously there are many factors. But he was an instrumental factor."" By phone, Farrar, a House member since 1995, said that among Democrats who defend against Republican-sought abortion restrictions, Rocap was ""essential"" and ""our go-to guy"" for devising legislative strategy and developing bill-stopping points of order, lining up witnesses--and knowing who to call in state agencies. She said she even remembered calling him even when he lived overseas. We followed up with Rocap, who told us by email that he accompanied his wife to an assignment abroad from mid-2013 through 2015. In that time, he said, the ACLU of Texas still hired him as its legislative strategist on abortion rights and reproductive health. By email, a spokeswoman for the Houston-based group, Anna Núñez, confirmed the described hiring. Farrar said: ""He just knows a lot about it,"" adding that it’s fair to say Rocap had stopped measures. ""I don’t know that we could have gotten as far as we did on many of those issues if he wasn’t there."" Farrar also acknowledged that Republicans had succeeded in passing abortion restrictions in recent years. ""Every session,"" she said, ""they file their whole litany of stuff and get something out of it."" Other ‘pro-life’ voices By email, Pojman and Melissa Conway, of Texas Right to Life, which calls itself the largest ""pro-life"" group in Texas, each expressed skepticism about Rocap’s claim. Pojman said that since 2011, NARAL Pro-Choice Texas ""has been spectacularly unsuccessful at stopping pro-life bills."" He included a list of proposals passed into law. Conway separately said ""moderate GOP leadership like"" Cook ""were the ones who stopped life-saving legislation from reaching the House floor where pro-life measures would have passed overwhelmingly."" Conversely, Kyleen Wright, president of the Arlington-based Texans for Life Coalition, credited Cook with helping Republicans advance most of what advocates sought. She singled out changes including the sonogram law, the de-funding of clinics connected to Planned Parenthood and the toughened standards for abortion clinics approved in 2013. Rocap, she wrote, ""was not successful in stopping any of this legislation."" Rocap: Criticisms no surprise We shared such analyses with Rocap, who commented by email: ""Anti-choice lobbyists attacking the successes of the pro-choice movement, despite our minority status in the legislature in Texas, is nothing new."" He added that the criticism  ""speaks to my experience and effectiveness that extremists view me as a threat."" Our ruling Rocap said in a voter mailer: ""When Republican extremists tried to take away abortion rights… Blake Rocap stopped them."" Rocap ranks among Texas ""pro-choice"" advocates who battled and sometimes derailed Republican moves pitched as reducing the prevalence of abortion. But Republicans also ultimately passed multiple restrictions into law; no one stopped that. We rate Rocap's incomplete statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Huey Rey Fischer nails lack of Texas legislators under age 30, overstates possible millenial vote
","One of seven Democratic hopefuls bidding to succeed state Rep. Elliott Naishtat, D-Austin, made a claim about the not-so-youthful Texas Legislature that made us wonder. Huey Rey Fischer, 23, said in a Feb. 8, 2016, press release touting endorsements by University of Texas students: ""The students are taking me to the Capitol! There isn’t a single legislator under the age of 30, even though millennials make up 25 percent of the electorate in Texas. This is our opportunity to change that."" Are there no elected 20-somethings under the dome while Texans born in the ‘80s or ‘90s -- a dictionary definition of ""millennials"" -- comprise a quarter of the state’s voting population? Short answers: Texas indeed has no legislators under age 30 and, depending on how you define millennials, you could make a case for such Texans comprising close to a quarter of the electorate, though this element needs unpacking. Counting younger legislators To our request for Fischer’s factual backup, his campaign manager, Allison Heinrich, noted by email a Texas Legislative Reference Library chart indicating that as of the 2015 legislative session, no legislators were younger than 30 -- which was still so, per state records, after two empty House seats were filled that year. Leighton Schubert, R-Brenham, was 32 on his election to represent the 13th district, and the winner of special election to represent the 123rd district, Diego Bernal, D-San Antonio, was 38. But that shutout of anyone under 30 also was unusual, according to library charts breaking down legislative demographics from 1995 on. The charts show at least one House member under age 30 at the start of each biennial regular session through 2013 -- and twice, in 2003 and 2007, the House had five members younger than 30. Millennials So, do millennials comprise about a quarter of the state’s electorate, meaning residents eligible to vote? Heinrich told us Fischer’s conclusion was based on dividing a projection of the number of 18- to 29-year-old Texas residents in 2014 -- 4,718,725 -- by the 18,915,297 people who made up the state’s voting-age population as of the November 2014 governor’s election, according to the Texas Secretary of State, the state’s chief elections officer. That math works. But Fischer might not have taken the best route to estimating millenials among us. Heinrich told us Fischer’s count of Texas adults under 30 came to her from Nick Dauster of the Department of State Health Services, who said in a 2015 email answering Heinrich’s query that agency staff drew from data compiled by the Texas State Data Center to reach a 2014 projected population of 4,718,275 Texans aged 18-29, presuming 2000-2010 migration rates. Other analysts For our part, we asked Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, about estimating the share of eligible-to-vote Texans aged 18-to-29. By email, Potter said the candidate’s cited estimate of Texans aged 18 to 29 accurately tracked center data. But, Potter said, U.S. Census Bureau 2014 population estimates released in June 2015 are considered more accurate. The bureau estimate suggests there were 4,715,612 people aged 18 to 29 in Texas in 2014 -- about 2,600 down from Fischer’s cited projection. Potter also wrote: ""Another factor to consider with this statement is the definition of electorate. If electorate means eligible to vote, consideration of citizenship and felony status should probably figure into the picture."" His point: Some share of the voting-age population consists of residents not eligible to vote. We asked the Secretary of State’s office about this aspect. Spokeswoman Alicia Pierce confirmed by email that its voting-age population figures posted for November 2014 included people ""not eligible to vote such as non-citizens and those convicted of a felony who have not fully discharged their sentence."" She added: ""If electorate means all those who are eligible to vote, we do not have a firm number."" There’s at least one other way to estimate young voters. We took Pierce up on her offer to break out the share of registered Texas voters under 30. As of Feb. 20, 2016, according to the provided breakdown, 2,725,526 Texas voters aged 18 through 29 were registered to vote, making up about 19 percent of the state’s nearly 14.3 million registered voters. Fischer comments Fischer, provided what we’d heard from Potter and Pierce, said by email he used the voting-age population to build his estimate of millennials in the state’s electorate because he didn’t identify a better statistic. He cautioned too that ""electorate"" takes in everyone qualified to vote, not just registered voters.  ""As an aside,"" Fischer wrote, ""it is important to note that representatives are still called to represent felons, undocumented immigrants, non-citizen permanent residents, and others who may not be eligible to vote for a myriad of reasons."" Our ruling Fischer said: ""There isn’t a single (Texas) legislator under the age of 30, even though millennials make up 25 percent of the electorate in Texas."" The Texas House and Senate each lacks legislators under age 30. But getting a fix on millenials in the Texas electorate can be slippery. Relying on an estimate of residents old enough to vote, as Fischer did, folds in people not eligible to vote--including non-citizens. On the other hand, nearly 20 percent of registered voters are millenials. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Cory Gardner flubs high court history exam
","Senators are digging deep for historic ammunition in refusing to consider any nominee by President Barack Obama to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Some senators have been flunking their exams on Supreme Court nomination history. During a discussion on the high court’s election-year vacancy on Morning Joe this week, Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado said, ""It's been since 1888 that a Senate of a different party than the president in the White House confirmed a Supreme Court nominee."" (Watch the video.) HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN IMMIGRATION FACT-CHECKER We looked hard at Gardner’s claim and found he fumbled the facts. Since 1895, there have been 14 times when a Senate controlled by a different party than the president’s party have confirmed his nominee. A Democratic-controlled Senate has confirmed a Republican president’s high court nominee 13 times from 1954 to 1991: For the last time a Republican-controlled Senate gave the nod to a Democratic president’s high court nominee you have to go back much further to 1895, when the GOP Senate confirmed Justice Rufus Peckham, President Grover Cleveland’s nominee. The non-partisan National Constitution Center reports, ""Of the 30 successful confirmations since 1945, 13 of the votes, or about 43 percent, came when the President's party didn’t control the Senate. This was especially true when the Democrats ran the Senate for long periods during the 1960s and 1970s.""  A spokeswoman for Gardner told us Gardner intended to cite a narrower example from a recent Washington Post story: ""While the [Morning Joe] panel was discussing the Supreme Court vacancy in the context of a presidential election year, Senator Gardner referred to the fact that 'the last time a justice was nominated to the Court in a presidential election year and confirmed by a Senate controlled by the opposing party was 1888, when President Grover Cleveland nominated Justice Melville Fuller to be Chief Justice.'"" It's true that in the 1888 presidential-election year, a Republican-controlled Senate confirmed not one but two high court nominees -- Melville Fuller and Lucius Lamar -- of Cleveland.  But Gardner's actual comment cast a wider net -- with no reference to the 1888 ""presidential election year."" The senator's statement in a broader context: ""If you look at the Constitution, the two clauses of the Constitution make it very clear the president shall nominate and the Senate shall provide advice and consent. It's been since 1888 that a Senate of a different party than the president in the White House confirmed a Supreme Court nominee."" Our ruling Gardner claimed, ""It's been since 1888 that a Senate of a different party than the president in the White House confirmed a Supreme Court nominee."" While he may have intended to invoke the example of Supreme Court nominations in the 1888 presidential election-year, he didn't say that.

Hillary Clinton is off-base on comparison of mortgage rejections by race
","A reader recently asked us to fact-check something Hillary Clinton said about mortgage discrimination during a MSNBC-Telemundo town hall in Las Vegas on Feb. 18, 2016. The reader noted that, in addition to reaching a nationally televised audience, Clinton’s comment had been ""going viral among real estate agents and lenders"" after a YouTube commentator posted a video about it titled, ""Hillary Lies about Mortgage Lending !!"" The video has attracted more than 22,000 views. At the town hall, Clinton was responding to an audience member who asked how she planned to help Hispanics who want to buy or keep their house, particularly in Nevada, a state hit hard by the Great Recession. Among Clinton’s suggestions was to ""provide more help so that more homeowners, Hispanic homeowners, African-American homeowners, those who want to have access to better credit, and better support. You know, credit has tightened up in ways that are just not fair. You are three times more likely to be able to get a mortgage if you're a white applicant than if you're black or Hispanic, even if you have the same credentials and you're presenting it to the people who are looking at it."" Clinton was essentially saying that mortgage lenders were engaging in significant racial and ethnic discrimination that can’t be explained by other factors, such as income or credit history. That’s a serious allegation, so we decided to take a closer look. After checking with the Clinton campaign, we learned that she misspoke at the Las Vegas event. As evidence, they pointed to several other speeches in which Clinton had used a more accurate version of the statistic. For instance, after winning the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 20, she said, ""We see African-American families denied mortgages at nearly three times the rate of white families."" She made similar comments at a Democratic dinner in Minnesota on Feb. 12 and interview with the BET network on Feb. 17. So where did these numbers come from? Studies released by the real estate website Zillow in February 2015 and November 2015. The Zillow study The study looked at federal data on mortgages. The 2013 data showed a denial rate for conventional loans of 10.4 percent for whites, 21.9 percent for Hispanics and 27.6 percent for African-Americans. The 2014 data showed somewhat lower denial rates across the board — 9.4 percent for whites, 18.8 percent for Hispanics, and 23.5 percent for African-Americans. These numbers pose a few problems with Clinton’s statement. For starters, these are denial rates, not acceptance rates, which was the metric Clinton used in her town hall comment. The acceptance rates for 2013 work out to 89.6 percent for whites, 78.1 percent for Hispanics and 72.4 percent for African-Americans, and using those numbers -- or the ones for 2014 -- her ratios don’t work. If you do use rejection rates, it was 2.7 times higher for African-Americans in 2013 and 2.1 times higher for Hispanics -- reasonably close to what Clinton said, though not a perfect fit. A bigger problem for Clinton, however, is that she said ""even if you have the same credentials,"" even though this study did not equalize for income, credit history or other factors before calculating those percentages. Indeed, Zillow made a point of noting in the study of 2013 data that while the ""playing field remains strikingly unequal"" in mortgage loans by race and ethnicity, differences in loan denial rates stem at least in part from income and geographical disparities between the three groups. ""The disparity in loan approvals is likely tied to a number of factors, including income,"" Zillow said. Specifically, wrote Zillow Chief Economist Stan Humphries, ""black and Hispanic applicants for conventional home loans make roughly $20,000 less per year than white applicants, resulting in much higher denial rates. Similarly, black and Hispanic communities are clustered in areas that saw huge run-ups in home values prior to the recession, and even larger drops during the crash."" Experts we contacted agreed with Zillow that differences by race and ethnicity can, and do, play a role in mortgage denials. Still, they said the scope of the racial and ethnic gap is hard to nail down, and is probably a lot lower than Clinton suggests. Andrew Hanson, a Marquette University economist, cautioned that income and credit scores are just two of the factors that could be contributing to the racial gap. Other, harder-to-quantify factors such as wealth and market experience can magnify existing biases as well. Hanson said he has conducted a smaller-scale study in which participants contact loan originators with basic inquiries. He then analyzed the loan originators’ offerings to measure any differences by race. The result? The size of the discrimination effect was about 2 percent. Hanson said there’s another caveat when gauging racial and ethnic discrimination: Much loan underwriting today is done electronically. ""The deny-or-accept decision isn’t left up to a person these days,"" he said. ""Information is basically given to a computer and the computer decides if the loan should be made.  That is not to say that humans do not make decisions along the way, but a human rarely has the final say on loan approval/denial."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""You are three times more likely to be able to get a mortgage if you're a white applicant than if you're black or Hispanic, even if you have the same credentials."" The Clinton campaign admits she misspoke. While there is evidence of disparities in mortgage acceptance rates by race, Clinton flubbed a talking point she has used correctly on other occasions. Experts say the gaps are not as drastic as Clinton says once you equalize for other key factors, such as income and credit history. We rate her statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AC3880>],/factchecks/2016/feb/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-base-comparison-mortgage-rejection/

Hillary Clinton says blacks more likely to be arrested, get longer sentences
","Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have been trying to court black voters ahead of the South Carolina Democratic primary by talking about the need to address systemic racism. In a 30-second commercial, Clinton says: ""Something is just fundamentally broken when African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do."" We wanted to see if there's evidence that being black influences whether someone will be arrested and, once convicted, ordered to do more time. HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN IMMIGRATION FACT-CHECKER The question plays out against a stark statistic — although African-Americans make up 13 percent of the general population, they account for 36 percent of the inmate population, according to the latest data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. Risk of arrest A heap of evidence shows African-Americans are arrested at higher rates. The Clinton campaign pointed out a Washington Post blog post (referring to a Brookings Institution piece) that said blacks are 3.6 times more likely to be arrested for selling drugs than whites even though whites are 45 percent more likely to sell drugs than blacks. But the data is from 1980, part of a paper that talks about drug dealing and legitimate self-employment. The campaign also had fresher data in mind, however, including a USA Today analysis of arrest rates around the country in the wake of the racial unrest in Ferguson, Mo. In at least 1,581 of 3,538 police departments, the paper found, blacks were even more likely to be arrested than in Ferguson. Only 173 departments ""arrested black people at a rate equal to or lower than other racial groups,"" the paper reported. The Bureau of Justice Statistics periodically surveys the public to study police-citizen interactions. Its most recent report in 2008 found that white, black and Hispanic drivers were stopped at similar rates by police. However, black drivers were about three times as likely as white drivers to be searched during a traffic stop. (When a search occurred, evidence was found in only 8.4 percent of the cases, but the report doesn't break that down by race.) The Sentencing Project, an advocacy group, has looked at that breakdown using 2013 profiling data posted in 2014 by Missouri's attorney general's office. It found that when a white driver was stopped in Ferguson, there was a 7 percent chance the car would be searched and a 34 percent chance that something would be found. But when a black driver was stopped, the search rate was significantly higher — 12 percent — and the odds of actually finding contraband were significantly lower (22 percent). Not only that, blacks were twice as likely as whites to be arrested during a traffic stop. In a spot check, we found similar patterns in Jefferson City.  It's not just traffic stops. According to a National Research Council report, drug arrest rates have long been higher for blacks, even though data show that blacks are generally no more likely to use drugs than whites and there's little evidence that they sell drugs more often than whites.  What surveys have shown ""is that the levels of self-reported drug sales are about the same for blacks and whites, especially under age 20,"" said Michael Tonry, professor of law at the University of Minnesota. ""But the big differences are that whites are more likely to sell to people they know, and they much more often sell behind closed doors. Blacks sell to people they don't know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest."" Sentencing There is also evidence for Clinton’s statement that blacks are more likely to get a stiffer sentence than a white person who has been convicted of the same crime and has the same criminal history. Studies have shown, for instance, that when prosecutors are deciding on what charges to file against suspects, they tend to select more severe charges for blacks and to use habitual offender laws against blacks more than whites under similar circumstances, particularly when it comes to drug and property crimes, according to a Florida study reported in the journal Criminology. A 2013 study in the Yale Law Journal reported that black men were nearly twice as likely to be charged with an offense that carried a mandatory minimum sentence than white men facing similar circumstances. When judges have discretion over how long a sentence should be for a specific crime, they tend to select longer sentences for blacks even if they have the same criminal history. After controlling for the arrest offense, a person's criminal history and other characteristics, sentences for black males were about 10 percent higher than for whites, the study found. The problem is that as cases work their way through the various steps of the criminal justice system, the degree of the disparity ""accumulates at each level,"" said Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst at the Sentencing Project. ""You're a little bit more likely to get arrested if you're a person of color than if you're white. You're a little bit more likely to have a higher bail amount to be released. That's going to make it harder for you to get released. You're a little more likely to get a worse plea deal offer,"" she said. ""As you go through the system, each individual stage makes some small contribution to the overall disparity that we see. But it's going to be significant as you go through the stages."" Tonry of the University of Minnesota agreed that sentences are longer for blacks generally, but ""it depends hugely on what crime you're talking about. ""If it's a drug crime that's affected by mandatory minimums, it's vastly longer,"" Tonry said. ""If you're talking about things not subject to mandatory minimums, on average, across the board, blacks probably get sentences that are 5 percent or 10 percent longer than whites do.""   How much of this is due to racism is a matter of debate. The experts say poverty may play a major role, but it can be hard to separate the two. The best studies try to adjust for the fact that minorities tend to be concentrated in poorer areas, where crime tends to be higher and there's a greater demand for police. That can skew the numbers. And sentences can be longer for poor people under pressure to cop a plea because they can't afford bail or a good lawyer. Our ruling Clinton said, ""African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do."" The research suggests that when you compare what happens to black and whites who are engaging in the same illegal activity and have the same criminal history, African Americans are more likely to be arrested, more likely to face tougher charges, and more likely to receive longer sentences than their caucasian counterparts. We rate the claim as True.     ""African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do.""  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3BA0C0>],/factchecks/2016/feb/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-blacks-more-likely-be-arreste/

Tampa Bay among top 10 regions most threatened by climate change, Sierra Club chapter says
","The head of Tampa Bay’s Sierra Club chapter warned the Hillsborough County Commission that building more roads will only make global warming’s consequences worse for the entire region. Chapter chairman Kent Bailey told commissioners in a Feb. 22, 2016, letter that the Sierra Club would not be supporting a proposed half-cent transportation sales tax referendum known as Go Hillsborough. Bailey said the measure doesn’t set aside enough money to pay for expanding mass transit. He argued that adding more roads and more cars to an already congested system will only make matters worse by increasing carbon pollution. ""Our community is one of the 10 most threatened by the sea level rise in the world,"" Bailey wrote. He added that the Tampa Bay area will be among the first to suffer from flooding caused by climate change.  There’s no doubt the oceans are rising, and Tampa Bay will feel the effects. But is the region among the most endangered in the world? Let’s just say that we found the bay area has a lot to lose. Flooding vs. sea level rise There are a bunch of ways to measure how climate change will affect the world’s cities. People will be displaced, economies will be ruined, or you may end up with not enough water (or too much). These are all issues Tampa Bay faces, so buckle up. When we asked Bailey how he came up with his ranking, he said he was referring to potential property losses, mostly in terms of real estate. ""We can move our people. But our fixed assets are a different story,"" he said. He cited several sources, including a report from global-warming researchers Climate Central, and a Scientific American article that said St. Petersburg was in particular danger from sea level rise.   He also pointed to a 2008 paper from the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The study focused on the effects of climate extremes on port cities — particularly storm surge. Coastal flooding is different than sea level rise, but experts told us Bailey is using a fair benchmark for comparison. Vulnerability to storm surge and sea level rise often are conflated in discussions on climate change, they said. ""They are related, but not exactly the same,"" said Ben Strauss, vice president for sea level and climate impacts at Climate Central. In general, sea level rise can make a big impact on flooding, and will assuredly make storm surges and flooding worse in the future. David Hastings, a marine science professor at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, said storm surges are especially dangerous in Tampa and St. Petersburg because of the relatively shallow offshore shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. Higher sea levels will make surges even more dangerous. But back to the OECD study: Economists examined 136 port cities and found that Tampa and St. Petersburg together were among the 10 cities with the most property at risk to wind damage and coastal flooding from storm surge. And that’s for right now, let alone after sea levels increase. ""The top 10 cities in terms of assets exposed are Miami, Greater New York, New Orleans, Osaka-Kobe, Tokyo, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Nagoya, Tampa-St. Petersburg and Virginia Beach,"" the paper read.  Those rankings could get better if steps were taken to mitigate flooding, the study said. But they could also get worse, as cities grow and gain more people. The effects of subsidence (the physical earth below the city changing or sinking, which is a major issue in Tampa Bay) and the changing climate could magnify the risk, too. Many of the same economists revisited the rankings in a 2013 study published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Tampa-St. Petersburg came in as the seventh-most at risk of flooding. If you’re looking for a price tag for how much Tampa Bay stands to lose, the OECD has one: In a catastrophic, once-in-100-years flood, losses to the region currently could be $49.6 billion. University of South Florida oceanography professor Gary Mitchum noted real estate losses are only part of the story. As the oceans rise permanently, the region’s tourism-based economy will suffer extensively. Many people who can afford to simply move away probably will, but low-wage workers dependent on disappearing service industry jobs will be stuck. Of course, the region’s property loss ranking may change some as population, planning and even geography shift. But these are from economists, considering economic impact. If we examined this another way — say, how many people will be permanently displaced by the eventual coastal floods that won’t recede — other places will have it much worse than Tampa Bay. Even the OECD researchers said their rankings would be different by that measure. Cities in China and southeast Asian countries, like Bangladesh and Vietnam, will be much more affected that way. It’s much harder to quantify how the human toll will affect regions because you can’t easily attach a dollar amount to it. ""The social impact of this is much more complicated,"" Mitchum said. ""The result that you get depends on how you assess it."" Our ruling Sierra Club's Bailey said, ""Our community (Tampa Bay) is one of the 10 most threatened by the sea level rise in the world."" He cited credible research that showed the region is among the most at risk of property damage from coastal flooding. He’s conflating that research with the effects of sea level rise, but several experts told us the problems are related. It's striking that Tampa Bay is already in great danger when it comes to potential property loss, but Bailey should have been more specific. There are other ways to measure the consequences of rising oceans beyond real estate. When we consider some of these factors, other major cities could be considered worse off than Tampa Bay. The statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3AD1C0>],/factchecks/2016/feb/26/sierra-club/tampa-bay-among-top-10-regions-most-threatened-cli/

""That was the end of that campaign, by the way, when they chose Ryan,"" Trump said Feb. 17, 2016 on the campaign trail in South Carolina. ""And I like him. He's a nice person, but that was the end of the campaign."" In some quarters, Romney’s choice of the Republican congressman from Janesville, who is now speaker of the House, was seen as boosting the GOP nominee’s chances. Democrat Barack Obama, of course, defeated the former Massachusetts governor to win a second term. But did Romney’s fortunes plummet as soon as he chose Ryan? Not according to the polls. Importance of the veep pick Let’s note at the top that a vice-presidential pick is only one of an innumerable number of factors that bear on the outcome of a presidential campaign. And it’s not typically regarded as a pivotal one. ""For the most part, voters look almost exclusively at the presidential candidate and there’s little evidence that very many of them base their choice on the vice-presidential selection,"" said longtime political reporter Peter Brown, who is now assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, which does national polling in presidential races.   Indeed, the vice-presidential selection might make a big splash in the news briefly, but it occurs long before voters cast their ballots. In the meantime, the campaign is quickly overtaken by other events. Gallup has found, though, that there typically is a temporary bump in the polls for presidential contenders shortly after they announce their running mate. That’s essentially what happened with Romney. Polls after the pick Romney announced his selection on Aug. 11, 2012. In Ryan, wrote Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Washington bureau chief Craig Gilbert, Romney was tapping ""perhaps his party's most influential politician on economic and budget policy, a huge favorite of pro-business and free-market conservatives, a personable policy wonk and energetic campaigner, and the architect of two deeply controversial federal budget plans that sharply scale back social spending and health care entitlements."" The controversial budget plans were what Trump cited when he made his statement about Ryan. Answering a question at a retirement community about Social Security, Trump said Romney was hurt by what he described as Ryan's calls to cut Social Security and other entitlement programs for the elderly. As the Washington Post noted in reporting Trump’s comments, shortly after Romney picked Ryan there was an ad attacking Ryan's stance on Medicare that showed an elderly woman in a wheelchair being thrown off a cliff by a man in a dark suit. The message on the screen: ""Mitt Romney made his choice. ... Now you have to make yours."" Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests for information to back his claim. But Romney did not tank in the polls after choosing Ryan. Pollster Charles Franklin of Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee told us that in the trend estimates he did of all national polls during 2012, Romney’s support was declining immediately before Ryan was picked, and rose immediately after. And in the polling completed just before the Ryan pick compared to polls begun just after, there was a slightly higher average for Romney after the pick, though it was not statistically significant. But there was no evidence, Franklin said, that support for Romney declined in the immediate aftermath of the Ryan pick. Said Kathleen Weldon, communications director at Cornell University’s Roper Center: Ryan ""neither hurt the ticket nor brought on a substantial bounce."" News stories on polling just before and just after the Ryan pick painted a similar picture. The pick gave Romney a ""micro-bump"" in battleground states such as Florida in Wisconsin, even though the ticket’s proposal for changing Medicare was wildly unpopular in those states, according to a Quinnipiac poll. A Huffington Post article, meanwhile, found in a handful of national polls that the veep bump was ""somewhere between small and non-existent."" In closing, two other notes, even though they reflect results long after Ryan was chosen: 1. The Romney-Ryan ticket did well among senior citizens As the Post article on Trump’s claim pointed out, despite Trump’s emphasis on how Ryan hurt the ticket among senior citizens, exit polls showed more voters over the age of 65 voted for Romney and Ryan than for Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, with the Republican candidates winning that age group by 12 percentage points. That was higher than in 2008 when Republican nominee John McCain won that age group by 8 percentage points or in 2004 when George W. Bush won it by 5 percentage points. 2. The ticket did as well or better at the ballot box than in polls prior to Ryan’s choice In polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Romney’s support ranged between 39 percent to 47 percent in six national polls taken in August 2012 in the days before Ryan was selected. Obama’s ranged from 44 to 52 percent. Ultimately, in the election, Romney ended up with 47 percent of the vote, with Obama getting 51 percent. Our rating Trump said that when Romney chose Ryan as his vice-presidential running mate, ""that was the end of the campaign."" Polls taken in the days after Ryan’s selection generally showed that Romney’s standing vs Obama was as good or better than in the days before the pick. We couldn’t find any evidence that the Ryan pick sunk the ticket. We rate Trump’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097398D80>],/factchecks/2016/feb/26/donald-trump/picking-paul-ryan-ended-mitt-romneys-chances-winni/

U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman criticizes Barack Obama over vetting of Syrian refugees
","With questions about border security and refugees from Syria still dominating the debate in the Republican presidential contest, we decided to look back in our files and tackle a claim made in late 2015 by U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin On Nov. 20, 2015, soon after the House passed a bill that would increase security checks on refugees from Iraq and Syria, Grothman appeared on conservative talker Jay Weber’s show on WISN (1130-AM). In the appearance, he asserted President Barack Obama has basically an open-door policy when it comes to immigrants. ""Whether it’s dealing with the Middle East or south of the border, Barack Obama is apparently not for vetting people and saying just anybody can come here and we’ll see what happens,"" said Grothman, R-Campbellsport.   Since Grothman made his statement in the context of the Syrian refugee bill, we’ll evaluate the claim with that in mind. Obama plans to accept about 10,000 people from Syria in 2016. Refugee process Obama has said Syrian refugees coming into United States must follow the same vetting process as all other refugees. But Republicans argue that is not enough and more stringent background checks are necessary, given concerns about terrorists posing as refugees and slipping into the country. Let’s take a closer look at the vetting process for those seeking refuge in the United States. Those seeking refuge must find a United Nations Refugee Agency and identify themselves as a refugee. The U.N. collects data on the applicant, such as their date and place of birth. Applicants are interviewed to confirm need for resettlement. Refugees from active war zones, including Syria, already must undergo additional checks, such as iris scans that are checked against terrorist databases. The White House says less than 1 percent of the global refugee population is considered strong candidates to be admitted to the United States and make it past this first check. Then, applicants are received by a federally funded Resettlement Support Center overseas. An applicant file is created with identifying documents and security checks conducted. Candidates are screened by at least four U.S. security agencies -- National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department. The agencies check for security risks, such as ties to known bad actors, and criminal history. The process continues with a Homeland Security interview; those from Syria get an ""enhanced review,"" which means their documents are scrutinized more closely. Fingerprints are taken and screened against federal databases. A medical screening occurs. Cultural orientation classes are taken. Travel is booked. Finally, the refugees arrives in the United States.   U.S. officials will eliminate any candidate who intelligence does not think will make a good candidate to enter the United States. ""Any doubt, they’re out,"" said Melanie Nezer, vice president of policy and advocacy for the refugee assistance group HIAS. Grothman’s backup Grothman’s team sent a series of links to news articles and quotes from federal officials as evidence of Obama’s stance on refugees. ""The idea that somehow they pose a more significant threat than all the tourists who pour into the United States every single day just doesn’t jive with reality,"" Obama said in his remarks after a meeting with the Canadian prime minister Nov. 19, 2015. Grothman also included a quote from FBI Director James Comey’s congressional testimony in October 2015. ""If we don’t know much about somebody, there won’t be anything in our data,"" Comey said. ""I can’t sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance that there’s no risk associated with this."" But Comey didn’t say the system is failing, or that no vetting occurs. Only that it is impossible to identify every potential problem. ""James Comey doesn’t have the power of absolute foresight,"" said Antonio Ginatta, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch. ""No level of vetting would get you to 100 percent."" Our rating Grothman said, ""Barack Obama is apparently not for vetting people and saying just anybody can come"" to the United States. But refugees are the most vetted people who enter the country -- and Syrian refugees already  face additional measures. What’s more, Grothman’s evidence didn’t back up his claim. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809719F980>],/factchecks/2016/feb/26/glenn-grothman/us-rep-glenn-grothman-criticizes-barack-obama-over/

Ted Cruz twists Donald Trump's talk about health care, 'socialized' medicine
","In a free-for-all Republican debate in Houston, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz attacked frontrunner Donald Trump for his position on health care. ""For decades, Donald has been advocating socialized medicine,"" Cruz said. ""What he said is the government should pay for everyone’s health care. And in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said if you don’t support socialized health care, you’re heartless."" Did Trump actually say that about socialized medicine? In a Republican debate? No. We looked at the transcripts going back a couple of months to the debate in Las Vegas on Dec. 15, 2015. We found Trump never used those words, nor anything close to them. There was an exchange in the Feb. 6 debate in Manchester, N.H., when socialized medicine came up, but it didn’t happen the way Cruz said. A question from panelist Mary Katherine Ham started the exchange. Ham: ""Mr. Trump, you have said you want to repeal Obamacare. You have also said, quote, ‘Everybody’s got to be covered,’ adding, quote, ‘The government’s going to pay for it.’ Are you closer to Bernie Sanders’ vision for health care than Hillary Clinton’s?"" Trump: ""I don’t think I am. I think I’m closer to common sense. We are going to repeal Obamacare. We’re going to repeal Obamacare. We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better."" Trump talked with ABC moderator Martha Raddatz at the same debate about increasing competition among private insurance companies and he praised health savings accounts. He finished his answer this way: Trump: ""What I do say is, there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a Republican, I don’t want that to happen. We’re going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else, and we’re going to take care of those people. ""And I think everybody on this stage would have to agree, you’re not going to let people die, sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country."" Raddatz: ""Sen. Cruz, to that point, Mr. Trump has said that your position on health care means that maybe you’ve got, quote, ‘no heart.’ There is a question here, though, about uncovered folks. You suggested repealing and replacing Obamacare. As we learned with President Obama’s broken promise that everyone could keep their plan, any major plan — change in health care policy carries with it the risk that some people will lose their insurance coverage or have to change it. How do you reassure that those people that repealing and replacing Obamacare is still in their best interest?"" Cruz: ""Well, let me take two different parts of that. Let me start with socialized medicine. Socialized medicine is a disaster. It does not work. If you look at the countries that have imposed socialized medicine, that have put the government in charge of providing medicine, what inevitably happens is rationing."" For the record, in the Dec. 15, 2015, debate, Trump called the country’s health care a ""disaster. In the Jan. 14, 2016, debate, Trump said, ""Our health care is a horror show. Obamacare, we’re going to repeal it and replace it."" Government’s role Cruz also asserted that Trump had said the government should pay for everyone’s health care. We asked the Cruz campaign for their sources and didn’t hear back. But in an interview on CBS News’ 60 Minutes in September 2015, Trump did say, ""Everybody's got to be covered."" However, in context he was talking about people who don’t make enough money to pay for insurance. Asked what he would do and who would pay, Trump said, ""I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people (and) the government's gonna pay for it."" It’s clear from the full interview that Trump did not say that the government should pay for everyone’s health care. He made that point again in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on Jan. 31, 2016, saying that Cruz’s attacks showed ""maybe he’s got no heart."" Back in 1999, Trump did support a single-payer health care system for America. In his 2000 book The America We Deserve, he said, ""We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing."" Trump does not hold that belief today. Our ruling Cruz said that Trump said in a recent debate that ""if you don’t support socialized health care, you’re heartless."" Trump did not say those words, or anything like them, in any recent debate. He advanced the idea of more competition among private insurance companies, and he said that government should take care of those who can’t afford insurance. While there was a time in the past when Trump supported a single-payer plan, there’s no substance to Cruz’s statement.

We Googled 'Trump Polish workers.' Here's what we found
","Florida Sen. Marco Rubio charged Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump with hypocrisy for hiring undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects instead of American citizens. ""He hired from Poland, and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment,"" Rubio said. ""That’s a fact. People can look it up. I’m sure people are Googling it right now, ‘Trump Polish workers.’ You’ll see $1 million for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did."" ""Wrong, wrong,"" Trump said. We did some Googling and also reached out to the Rubio campaign, which referred us to media reports about a protracted class-action lawsuit involving his hiring of Polish aliens 36 years ago. Rubio is right about the Polish workers, but it’s unclear how much Trump ended up paying. (The Trump campaign did not get back to us.) Here’s the story. Sometime between 1979 and 1980, Trump hired a contractor to demolish an old building in midtown Manhattan to make way for Trump Tower. The contractor signed on workers from a local union and, to meet Trump’s tight deadline, also brought on 200 undocumented laborers from Poland dubbed the ""Polish Brigade."" The Polish employees were off-the-books, working 12-hour shifts seven days a week for $4 to $5 an hour, with no overtime. Some workers were never paid what they were owed. In 1983, union members sued a union boss, Trump and his contractor for cheating the union out of pension and welfare funds by hiring the Polish Brigade. Trump owed the union pension fund $1 million, the plaintiffs said. Appearing in court in 1990, Trump blamed the violations on the contractor and denied knowing that the Polish workers were undocumented. ""Nobody’s proven to me that they were were illegal,"" Trump said, according to a Newsday report from the time. Nonetheless, Manhattan Judge Charles Stewart ruled against Trump a year later, saying that his representative ""knew that the Polish workers were doing demolition work"" and that his company participated in a ""conspiracy"" to cheat the union. Trump owed the workers a little more than $325,000 plus interest and attorney’s fees and costs, Stewart ruled. That wasn’t the end of it. Trump appealed and it would drag on for another decade. In 1998, several members of the Polish Brigade told the New York Times about their horrid working conditions. But Trump repeated that he didn’t know about the legal status of the Polish Brigade and said he would not settle the case out of court ""on principle,"" according to the New York Times. If the case was retried and Trump lost again, he would have had to pay about $4 million, the Times calculated. A year later, Trump quietly settled, according to the New York Daily News, but the agreement was placed under seal. ""It has been resolved on terms agreeable to both sides,"" labor lawyer Wendy Sloan, who represented the union members, told the New York Daily News. Our ruling Rubio said Trump ""hired from Poland and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment."" It was Trump’s contractor, not Trump himself, who hired 200 undocumented Polish workers to demolish a building to make room for Trump Tower in Manhattan. Trump said he didn’t know. The lawsuit sought $1 million in damages, and a judge ruled that Trump had to pay $325,000 plus interest. But the case was appealed and before it was retried, Trump settled the case out of court, so it’s unclear how much he ended up doling out. Rubio’s statement is partially accurate but missing that context.

Marco Rubio: We 'wiped out' Obamacare 'bailout fund' for insurance companies
","Florida Sen. Marco Rubio took an outsize swing at a provision of Obamacare as GOP presidential candidates hammered their favorite target during the CNN debate in Houston.   ""When they passed Obamacare, they put a bailout fund in Obamacare,"" Rubio said while addressing frontrunner Donald Trump on Feb. 25, 2016. ""All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money. We led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund."" Did Obamacare contain a bailout for insurance companies, and did Rubio and congressional Republicans get rid of it? In short, they postponed a provision of the law, but it wasn’t a bailout. Risky business What Rubio calls a bailout is actually a part of the Affordable Care Act known as ""risk corridors."" When the health care law started requiring insurance companies to sell policies to everyone (even sick people with pre-existing conditions), those companies were caught in a tough spot. They didn’t know how much to charge in premiums to cover expenses for all those new policies. So the law set up a three-year period, from 2014 to 2016, during which the government would spread the risk for insurers in the new law’s marketplaces while they adjusted premiums. This program is known as risk corridors. If a company is good at setting its rates and make more than a certain amount, they pay Washington some of their extra money. These are called user fees. If a company is not so good at setting rates and loses money, the government would cover some of their losses. That’s the bailout to which Rubio is referring. He started calling it a ""bailout"" for unsuccessful insurance companies in 2013, the same year he introduced an ill-fated bill in the Senate to repeal the program. But let’s be clear: Several experts told us risk corridors aren’t a bailout. A bailout is usually a program that saves a company after the fact. Risk corridors are a mechanism that was put in place to deal with a problem that everyone assumes could occur. And they aren’t new, either. The risk corridors program was modeled after a successful plan that was part of George W. Bush’s Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, albeit slightly different than the Obamacare version. No one referred to that as a bailout. Finding money for payments Now, part of the problem is that the the health care law didn’t say where it would get the money for any risk corridor payments. Remember those user fees from successful insurers? The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, later decided they would use that money to make any payments owed to insurers that weren’t so successful. In 2013, CMS said insurers who said they needed money would get it, ""regardless of the balance of payments and receipts"" in the program. Rubio took this to mean that if there wasn’t enough money from user fees to cover the payments, the White House would ask Congress for money -- that is, tax revenue. CMS said in April 2014 it wouldn’t ask Congress for an appropriation, but instead would make up the difference in later years if the marketplace didn’t bring in enough user fees. Rubio went to work, urging then-Speaker of the House John Boehner in October 2014 to block potential tax money appropriations for risk corridor payments. That’s what Congress did. When lawmakers passed a spending bill in December 2014, it included special language called a ""rider"" that said the CMS’ parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, could not use any extra money in its budget to pay risk corridor expenses. That effectively locked CMS into its stated plan of using user fees. (The same rider was included in the 2015 spending bill.) Some legislators have credited Rubio with inspiring this language, although there have been questions about how much credit he can take. Rubio reintroduced his bill to repeal risk corridors. By October 2015, it became apparent the risk corridors program didn’t work so well in the first year. CMS announced the program took in $362 million in user fees for 2014, while less successful insurers asked for a total of $2.87 billion, leaving a $2.5 billion shortfall CMS can’t pay. CMS said it would pay out 12.6 percent of claims from 2014, then wait to see next year’s results. Some insurers left the marketplaces or even collapsed altogether, leading Rubio to crow his actions have been ""a big part of ending Obamacare for good."" (We likely won't know what the program took in for 2015 until fall 2016, and 2016’s totals until 2017.) Whether it will really kill Obamacare is up for debate. Some legal scholars have said all the rider did was highlight a problem the law already had and prevent a workaround. Two years ago, the Congressional Budget Office said the risk corridors will likely eventually break even by 2016. If the program doesn’t, CMS will have to find the money somehow or ask Congress to make an appropriation to pay insurers. Otherwise, insurers could sue to get those payments. An Oregon insurance company that is no longer offering marketplace plans did just that on Feb. 24, suing the government for $5 billion over missed risk corridors payments. Our ruling Rubio said, ""When they passed Obamacare, they put a bailout fund in Obamacare. … We led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund."" The ""bailout fund"" is actually a provision in the Affordable Care Act called risk corridors, designed to temporarily aid insurers as they adjust premiums. Rubio helped persuade Congress to prevent Health and Human Services from being able to cover expenses its own budget. But experts have said Rubio is wrong to call the program a bailout, and that the program is supposed to pay for itself through fees from insurers. Furthermore, the program hasn’t been ""wiped out."" At best, Rubio and Congress have temporarily limited one potential way CMS could have covered insurance companies' losses. We’ll have to see what happens when the program expires after 2016 -- then any outstanding bills will be due, one way or another. We rate Rubio’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097477240>],/factchecks/2016/feb/26/marco-rubio/rubio-we-wiped-out-obamacare-bailout-fund-insuranc/

Advocacy group misses the mark with Malawi doctor tally
","Anger over the tax strategies of American multinational corporations isn’t confined to America. Activists and lawmakers in the United Kingdom want to revamp the corporate tax law there, too. They argue, it wouldn’t just benefit British taxpayers, but it also would help some of the poorest nations. Thanks to treaties in the United Kingdom they say, multinational companies do a dandy job of avoiding taxes on their operations in developing countries. This makes it even harder for these nations to meet the basic needs of their people. ActionAid UK, an international anti-poverty group, drove home the point with a tweet that said ""Malawi has just 300 doctors for 16 million people."" For the record, the tweet appears to slightly undercount the population of Malawi -- a country surrounded by Zambia, Tanzania and Mozambique. The World Bank estimated the nation's population at 16.7 million in 2014. The CIA World Factbook estimates a 2015 population nearing 18 million. The heart of this claim, however, is the number of doctors in the country. That’s worthy of a deeper look. The doctor tally We contacted ActionAid UK but did not hear back. The most likely source behind the group’s statement is the World Health Organization’s Global Health Observatory. But the WHO’s most recent data for Malawi comes from 2008. The Medical Council of Malawi has lists of every person licensed to practice in Malawi. They include doctors, nurses, physician assistants, dentists and more. You can see a list of new registrations here, and a longer list that goes back many years. Taken at face value, there are more than 620 doctors, surgeons, pediatricians and other specialists in Malawi. (This includes some foreign doctors, and excludes physicians who applied solely on a temporary basis.) But that’s at least a little bit off. Some of the names have been on the list for over 20 years. While those people might still be practicing in Malawi, there’s no guarantee that they are and research shows that after about five years of working in the country, some doctors decide to leave, or shift into work that doesn’t involve treating patients. Still, Adamson Mulla, a professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Malawi, told us while the list has its flaws, it’s more accurate than ActionAid UK’s estimate. ""The wisdom that there are 300 doctors in Malawi looks silly,"" Mulla said. Now whether the number is 300 or closer to 600, the count pales relative to the country’s 16.7 million people. But the claim further ignores trained medical professionals who are not doctors. Malawi’s clinical officers and medical assistants Helen de Pinho, an assistant professor of public health at Columbia University, has studied Malawi’s health care system. De Pinho takes issue with the simplicity of the ActionAid message. ""If you are trying to assess availability of clinical skills then just looking at doctors is misleading,"" de Pinho said. ""We should also look at the number of medical assistants and clinical officers trained and deployed."" Medical assistants provide basic primary care in clinics. Clinical officers have at least four years of training in internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology and surgery. ""They are able to do basic and emergency surgery including caesarean sections, and in rural districts,  perform over 95 percent of the c-sections,"" de Pinho said. ""The clinical officers really are the backbone of the clinical services, especially in the more rural district hospitals."" The Medical Council rolls show 925 clinical officers. If we add their ranks to the number of doctors, there would be about 1,400 doctors and clinical officers. If we include the 836 medical assistants, the number rises to over 2,000. Another researcher of Malawi’s health care system, Kate Mandeville at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told us that unlike physicians, clinical officers and medical assistant are far more likely to stay and work in Malawi. So the Medical Council roster is more accurate for these health care providers. A shortage remains The ActionAid tally of doctors overlooks the bulk of the health care workforce in Malawi, but to be sure, at the end of the day, the country still lags far behind other nations. In round figures, Malawi has 0.12 health care workers for every 1,000 people ( totalling doctors, clinical officers and medical assistants.) Roughly speaking and relying on WHO data, Kenya has about 10 times as many skilled professionals as Malawi (about 1.1 health care workers for every 1,000.) Nigeria, the continent’s largest economy, has about 2.1 workers for every 1,000. South Africa, the second largest economy, has 7.6. Mandeville told us that the number of doctors, along with other clinicians, is ""far too low."" Yet she urged caution in putting too much stock in that yardstick. ""The 300 figure has the most shock value, but scaling up the number of doctors alone is unlikely to have much impact on population health outcomes,"" Mandeville said. Our ruling ActionAid UK said that Malawi has 300 doctors to treat 16 million people. A current estimate puts that figure closer to 600. And as experts note, the statistic overlooks the clinical officers and medical assistant who play at least as important a role as physicians, especially in Malawi’s rural areas. That said, relative to the size of the population, Malawi suffers from a critical shortage of health care workers -- of any sort. The numbers ActionAid offered might not be perfect. But the broader point the group is making is largely accurate.
