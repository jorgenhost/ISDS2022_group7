No, The Supreme Court Did Not Strike Down Voting-By-Mail
","Election officials in California and across the nation are gearing up to expand mail-in voting this fall, they say to offer the public a safe way to vote amid the pandemic.  But as President Trump and some of his supporters continue to rail against the decades-old practice, more claims are popping up on social media either questioning vote-by-mail’s legitimacy or cheering on restrictions to it.  This popular Facebook post is one example:  ""If you haven’t already heard, the Supreme Court ruled today NO VOTING BY MAIL !!!""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook). While this post was first shared weeks ago, it had been viewed 140,000 times over the past 24 hours, according to Facebook. We decided to check it out.  Background On Vote-By-Mail California and many other states are getting ready for a surge of absentee voting, as vote-by-mail was previously called in the state.   In May, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered all counties to send mail-in ballots to all active registered voters in the state. Newsom’s order was codified in June when he signed AB 860 passed by the Legislature.  There’s a patchwork of voting methods across the nation. Just five states regularly conduct universal vote-by-mail elections: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington. In those states, ballots are automatically sent to all registered voters, who then fill them out and mail them back or drop them off with election officials. Twelve states allow counties to opt-in to mail-voting or allow it for certain elections, but not others.  Voters in another 29 states have the option to vote-by-mail in federal elections, but must request such a ballot, according to an article by FiveThirtyEight.  In California, voters have used mail ballots since 1962 and they’ve become increasingly popular: The majority of ballots cast in each of the past four general elections and eight primaries were by mail, according to the Secretary of State’s Office website. Did The Supreme Court Really Strike Down Voting By Mail?  The Facebook post gives the impression that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the entire practice of vote-by-mail. But that is light years from what happened.  In reality, the high court on June 26, the same day the post appeared, denied an emergency motion by Texas Democrats to expand mail-in voting for that state only. Susan Hays, an attorney working on the case for Texas Democrats, said the case is still pending and the U.S. Supreme Court could rule on its merits later this year. Hays said a similar version of the case is also pending before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The June 26 ruling had no effect on vote-by-mail rules in other states across the nation, nor did it end the right in Texas.  Texas already allows vote-by-mail for those 65 and older, voters who are sick or have a physical condition that prevents them from traveling to the polls and others who are absent from their county, according to CNN.  The Facebook user who made the original post appears to be from Texas. It is possible he intended his post to mean that the Supreme Court had eliminated or curtailed vote-by-mail in that state alone, but he provided no context. And, again, the court’s ruling does not mean there’s ""no voting by mail"" in Texas or anywhere else.  About a week after the post was published, the Supreme Court issued a separate ruling on mail-in voting in Alabama. It temporarily blocked a lower court's decision that, citing the COVID-19 pandemic, would have made it easier for residents of three Alabama counties to vote by absentee ballot in July 14 primary runoff elections, according to an NPR news report.  But, again, that ruling came after the post was published, and has no bearing on existing rights to vote-by-mail in Alabama or other states.  Our ruling A Facebook post suggested the U.S. Supreme Court had struck down voting by mail nationwide.  That’s far from the truth. The high court rejected an expansion of mail-in voting in Texas in late June. It also voted down an effort to make the practice easier in three counties in Alabama in early July.  But those rulings in no way take away existing rights to vote-by-mail in dozens of states across the nation.  We rate the claim False.  FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Update: This article has been updated to show the U.S. Supreme Court denied an emergency motion to expand mail-in voting in Texas. A decision on the merits of the case is still pending.  CapRadio's PolitiFact California will continue answering questions about vote-by-mail and similar topics through the November 2020 election.

Don’t trust this comparison of daily coronavirus deaths with other diseases
","A social media post says the novel coronavirus causes a small number of deaths compared with other diseases, essentially arguing that the coronavirus shouldn’t have forced such widespread economic shutdowns. The July 8 post is headlined, ""Disease deaths per day worldwide."" In a bar chart, the post lists more than two dozen communicable diseases, along with what it says are the number of worldwide deaths per day for each. According to the chart, the top five killers are tuberculosis (3,014 deaths), hepatitis B (2,430), pneumonia (2,216), HIV/AIDS (2,110), and malaria (2,002). About two-thirds of the way to the bottom of the list is the coronavirus, with just 56 daily deaths. Punctuated by a big red arrow, the post says, ""THIS is what collapsed the world economy."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We found that the post (seen below) is highly misleading. Here are some big problems with it.   We researched the number of deaths from each of the diseases in the post and found some variation. But they were usually in the ballpark — except for COVID-19. Usually, cause-of-death data is released a couple of years after the fact and is subject to estimation. But coronavirus is such an urgent health threat, deaths are tabulated on a daily basis with a much smaller lag. In tiny type, the post cites data as of March 9, 2020. That was just before coronavirus deaths began their exponential growth — and just before U.S. communities started to shut down schools and restrict public gatherings to prevent its further spread. On March 9, the seven-day rolling average for worldwide coronavirus deaths was 130. (It’s unclear where the 56 deaths cited in the post came from.) By April 18, the peak to date, the seven-day rolling average was 7,036. By July 12, the number had dropped to 4,945, but that was still far higher than the 56 deaths claimed in the post. We re-did the chart based on the best available data, including those three options for coronavirus deaths, marked in red:   Both the April or July numbers for COVID-19 deaths are larger than for any of the other diseases. The closest is tuberculosis, with 3,452 deaths. ""The original figure is incredibly misleading, especially if still being circulated today,"" said Brooke Nichols, a health economist and infectious disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health. Unlike for most of the other diseases on this list, ""it needs to be pointed out that we have not yet had one year’s experience"" with the virus to have an accurate count and to understand the disease’s dynamics over time, said Nicole Gatto, associate professor in the School of Community and Global Health at Claremont Graduate University. It’s too early, she said, ""to fairly compare with these other causes of death."" In all, then, the notion that coronavirus is causing a piddling number of deaths is bunk. There’s not yet an effective drug or vaccine for coronavirus. That’s also the case for a few of the other diseases on the list, including norovirus, dengue fever, Ebola, SARS, and MERS. For most of the diseases on the list, however, we do have one or more effective tools.  Vaccines exist for hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, seasonal flu, whooping cough, typhoid, cholera, meningitis, measles, rabies, yellow fever, and chicken pox, Nichols said. Effective treatments are available for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, and malaria has an effective prophylaxis. But for COVID-19, not having an effective vaccine or treatment means that the only tool is to limit personal contact and maintain good hygiene. Doing this makes economic shutdowns a much more urgent tool for the coronavirus than for any of the other diseases on the list. While tuberculosis, measles, pneumonia, the seasonal flu, whooping cough, SARS, and MERS are spread by respiratory pathways, most of the others do not.  They may spread through contaminated food or water, such as cholera; or bodily fluids, like HIV/AIDS; or animal vectors, such as malaria or rabies. Since respiratory diseases are particularly hard to control, they are more likely to require significant disruptions, such as economic shutdowns. You wouldn’t need a broad-scale economic shutdown to prevent HIV/AIDS, because it doesn’t spread through casual contact. For most of the other diseases on the list, you would mainly need a robust public health system. Some of the other diseases on this list aren’t apples to apples because they’re regional.  Malaria and dengue are carried by certain types of mosquito, so if you don’t live near the mosquitoes, you won’t get the disease. The parasite that causes leishmaniasis tends to be found only in certain areas. For other diseases, many wealthier countries have been able to vaccinate to a level of herd immunity, reducing the risk of catching the illness in those places even if you’re unvaccinated. By contrast, the coronavirus spread within months to nearly everywhere in the world. The post said that only 56 coronavirus deaths a day was enough to collapse the world economy, even though thousands of people die daily from tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and other diseases. For starters, the post chose March 9 as its date for coronavirus deaths, which was right before deaths soared. Subsequent daily totals show that coronavirus deaths have become larger than any other disease on the list. In addition, coronavirus poses special risks that may need to be ameliorated by economic closures. It spreads through the air, there is no vaccine or treatment, and by now it’s established itself in most countries, so in many cases, limiting casual contact between people may be the only effective way of stopping the virus’ spread. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BD2D00>],/factchecks/2020/jul/15/facebook-posts/dont-trust-comparison-daily-coronavirus-deaths-oth/

No, the US is not alone in facing a possible second wave of COVID-19 infections
","A proud supporter of President Donald Trump sees a political conspiracy behind the recent resurgence in coronavirus cases in the United States. She claimed on Facebook: ""The reason no other Country on Earth is having a ‘second wave’ is because they are not trying to unseat a President in November."" The woman includes a photo of Trump in her Facebook profile, along with this message: ""MAGA all day, every day! 🇺🇸♥️💯👍🏻Best President Ever."" The post, which has been shared tens of thousands of times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There isn’t a precise definition of second wave. But the United States is not alone in experiencing an increase in COVID-19 cases. As we’ve reported, the United States is arguably still in the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. In comments published June 16, Vice President Mike Pence argued there isn’t a second wave, while Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top federal infectious-disease expert, insisted: ""We’re still in a first wave.""  There’s no official definition of when a ""wave"" begins or ends, but generally speaking, it requires a peak in infections followed by a substantial reduction. A new rise and peak would signal the start of another wave. The United States had a peak of infections in April, a small reduction, and then a new higher peak recently. On July 9, the date of the Facebook post, the COVID Tracking Project reported that for the third week in a row, the country set an all-time record for new COVID-19 cases, confirming more than 367,000 new infections.  The project also reported that for the week ending July 9, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 grew 18% and, for the first time since April, the number of deaths rose week-over-week. Here are examples showing the United States isn’t alone: Cases in 22 countries in Africa more than doubled over the last month, the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota reported July 8. Worldwide, of the 45 countries to have recorded more than 25,000 coronavirus cases to date, 21 currently have relaxed responses to the pandemic and, of these, 10 are reporting a rising number of cases, The Guardian newspaper reported June 25. The 10 included the United States, Germany and Switzerland. ""We all want to avoid whole countries going back into total lockdown, that is not a desire that anybody has. But there may be situations in which that is the only option,"" Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization’s Health Emergencies Program, said at a July 10 press conference. ""No other country"" is having a ""second wave"" of COVID-19 ""because they are not trying to unseat a President in November,"" a Facebook post claimed. There is debate about whether the United States is in the first or the second wave of the coronavirus outbreak, although many experts say the first wave has not ended. Surges in new coronavirus cases have occurred in the United States, but in many other countries, as well. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C006200>],/factchecks/2020/jul/14/facebook-posts/no-us-not-alone-facing-possible-second-wave-covid-/
"['Health Care', 'Health Check', 'Alex Azar']","
Azar says federal law had preexisting conditions covered before ACA. Not so much.
","One of the most popular features of the Affordable Care Act is its guarantee of insurance coverage — at no greater cost — for people with preexisting health conditions. Thus, even as the Trump administration argues before the Supreme Court that the entire Affordable Care Act should be declared invalid, the president and his administration officials maintain that regardless of what happens to the ACA, they will protect people who have had health problems in the past. Speaking to a ""virtual health summit"" sponsored by the political newspaper The Hill, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar answered a question about the case, Texas v. Azar, by pointing out ""it’s in statute already in HIPAA that preexisting conditions are covered,"" implying that if the ACA were declared unconstitutional, those protections would remain in place for everyone. Umm… Not so much.  When we checked with HHS for more information about Azar’s comment, a spokesperson reiterated the secretary’s statement, adding that Azar was ""clear that the story on preexisting conditions doesn’t end with HIPAA"" and that affordability is a critical component. So we investigated. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a law we have examined before, was passed by a Republican-led Congress and signed by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1996. It is best known for safeguarding medical privacy and patient access to medical records, even though the privacy provisions were added toward the end of congressional deliberations. HIPAA’s original purpose was to end what was known as ""job lock,"" a situation in which people with preexisting conditions were reluctant to leave jobs with health insurance even for other positions with health insurance for fear their conditions would not be covered or they would be subject to long waiting periods for coverage. Both scenarios were common at the time. HIPAA addressed that problem — as long as people maintained ""continuous"" coverage, defined as having health insurance for at least 12 months without a break of more than 63 days. People who met that requirement could not have waiting periods or denials of coverage imposed upon their own or a family member’s preexisting condition. HIPAA included protections for people with coverage in the small-group insurance market, which primarily comprises small businesses, by requiring insurers who sold policies in that market to sell to all small groups, regardless of health status, and to cover every eligible member of the groups — again, regardless of health status. But HIPAA was not designed to comprehensively address the problem of people with preexisting conditions getting and keeping affordable health insurance. For starters, the protections were only for people who already had job-based insurance, to make it easier for them to move to other job-based insurance. It did nothing for those in the individual insurance market who needed to purchase their own coverage — such as self-employed people and those working for companies that did not offer health insurance. HIPAA attempted to create a pathway for people transitioning from employer-sponsored to individual coverage. It ensured that, after leaving a job, people who secured insurance through another law, the 1986 Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, or COBRA, would be eligible to buy a ""conversion"" plan from their insurer once their previous job-based benefits were exhausted. However, two giant problems arose. First, COBRA, which allows individuals to continue their employer-provided coverage for up to 18 months if they pay the entire premium themselves (plus a small administrative fee), is prohibitively expensive for most people. In 2019, the average premium for a single worker was $599 per month. The other problem was that even if a former worker did manage to pay for COBRA coverage until that 18-month period ended, there was no limit on how much insurers could charge for the conversion policies. So, even if they were technically available, they were frequently unaffordable. There were other problems. COBRA coverage was not available to people who worked for small businesses, or for those who became unemployed because the business they worked for failed and no longer offered insurance to anyone. HIPAA also did not stipulate which benefits had to be offered. The ACA sought to deal with HIPAA’s shortcomings. It required most employers to offer coverage, and for those purchasing their own, it required insurers to provide a comprehensive package of benefits at the same price to all purchasers, regardless of health status. However, the ACA rewrote the HIPAA provisions regarding preexisting conditions, so if the ACA is struck down by the Supreme Court, it’s not clear whether even HIPAA’s lesser provisions would remain. Experts disagree about this, but there is a possibility that HIPAA’s protections could be swept away along with the ACA. Later in his answer to the question posed at The Hill’s summit, Azar pointed out that there are significant affordability problems with coverage under the ACA, as well. ""So we will work with Congress if the time ever comes, to get real affordable solutions,"" he said. That’s true… ACA plans, even with subsidies, can be too expensive for some people, and prohibitive for those who earn just slightly too much to qualify for government help. Earlier this month, Democrats in the House passed a bill to make ACA plans more affordable.  Azar’s statement suggested that if the Supreme Court rules against the ACA and that sweeping law is nullified, Americans with preexisting conditions would continue to have the protections originally offered under HIPAA. Though it contains an element of truth, it leaves out critical pieces of information. For instance, the HIPAA protections are not equivalent to those provided by the ACA. First, they are geared toward people who have work-based insurance coverage — as long as that coverage is continuous for at least 12 months with lapses no longer than 63 days. One expert we consulted pointed out that this window could be especially problematic now, during a time of ""enormous economic dislocation."" Additionally, the ACA rewrote the HIPAA provisions regarding preexisting conditions — bringing into question what might become of them, too. We rate Azar’s claim Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DEC880>],/factchecks/2020/jul/14/alex-azar/azar-says-federal-law-had-preexisting-conditions-c/

Woman who says she was barred from voting in La. GOP primary was actually a Democrat.
","A supporter of President Donald Trump claimed in a video that she was denied the right to vote for Trump and other Republicans in Lousiana’s July 11 primary election. The five-minute video, which is also on YouTube, had been shared 75,000 times on Facebook within six hours after it was posted by conservative commentator David Harris Jr. ""Could this be a trend? This better not keep happening! Everyone needs to see this!"" Harris wrote. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In fact, according to local officials, the woman was prevented from voting in the Republican primary because she was a registered Democrat. In the video, the woman is wearing a baseball hat that says, ""Yes, I’m a Trump girl, get over it."" As she begins to speak, text on the screen says: ""Registered Republican not allowed to vote!""  The woman said that when she entered the polling place, ""I couldn’t vote for my party. The Republican lights would not light up."" She made an apparent reference to a poll worker who, she said, told her that she must not be registered properly. She said he checked and told her she is registered as a Democrat; she objected, insisting she is registered Republican. She said the poll worker told her she could not vote for any Republicans in that day’s election and would have to change her party registration in order to vote Republican in the next primary election.  The woman finishes her video by saying: ""Go, Trump."" The woman didn’t identify herself or specify where she lived, but she did refer to Lafayette. The U.S. election calendar is pretty light in July, but Louisiana did hold its presidential primary on July 11, two days before the posting of the video. The primary originally was scheduled for April 4, but was rescheduled twice because of the coronavirus. As expected, Trump won the GOP primary and former Vice President Joe Biden won the Democratic primary. Two hours west of New Orleans, the city of Lafayette is the seat of Lafayette Parish. In Louisiana, 40 parishes, including Lafayette, have closed presidential primaries. Only registered Democratic voters can vote in the Democratic Party primary, registered Republicans in the Republican Party primary and registered Independents in the Independent Party primary. These primaries are closed to all other registered voters. Lafayette election officials received about 250 calls on election day, most of them from people complaining that they couldn't vote for the candidate of their choice in the closed primary, the Acadiana Advocate reported. All of the problems were because the individuals were registered with one political party and wanted to vote for a candidate in another party, said Lafayette Parish Registrar of Voters Charlene Menard, according to the newspaper. ""Of all the phone calls we received,"" she said, ""not one was our error."" The local officials also addressed the video. According to the Advocate: ""A Lafayette Parish woman wearing a Trump hat posted a video on Facebook on Saturday saying she was not allowed to vote and putting the blame on election officials, alleging corruption. ""Menard and Clerk of Court Louis Perret both contacted the woman, providing her with her voter registration information that shows she is registered as a Democrat. She originally was registered as a Democrat, switched it to Republican around 2011, then got online and switched her voter registration back to Democrat, they said. ""As recently as April, she updated her address and kept her registration as a Democrat, Perret said. ‘Her allegations are completely baseless and false,’ he added."" In May, we examined complaints that Republican voters in Oregon, which does all balloting by mail, received the wrong ballots for that state’s closed primary election. We found that many voters didn’t realize which party they were registered under. Oregon voters registered as Republicans receive ballots with Republican primary races on them and voters registered as Democrats get ballots with Democratic races. Nonpartisan contests appear on both ballots. Anger and confusion surfaced when some voters received ballots with only nonpartisan races. State Rep. Mike Nearman, a Republican, told PolitiFact at the time that his office received hundreds of complaints from voters who say they received the wrong ballot. He said that after speaking to some GOP voters, it was clear they had forgotten they had changed their status from GOP to unaffiliated after, for example, getting mad at a particular GOP politician. A video widely shared on Facebook claimed: ""Registered Republican not allowed to vote."" The woman in the video said that she is a Republican and was prevented from voting in a Republican primary.

Wisconsin GOP misfires by saying Democratic mayors closed polling places to ‘cause chaos'
","As state and local officials gear up for a historic election in November, many haven’t forgotten the tumult surrounding Wisconsin’s spring contest.  The April 7, 2020 election made national headlines as Republicans and Democrats sparred over whether to hold an in-person election in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. When the lawsuits ended and election day came, some voters waited in line for hours as municipalities contended with poll worker shortages and a surge in absentee ballots. In the end, results were not released until nearly a week later. With the Aug. 11, 2020 primary for state offices only about a month away, the April election came up in a Twitter spat between state Democrats and Republicans. ""Remember when *Democratic Mayors* in some of Wisconsin's largest cities closed voting locations in April to cause chaos?"" the Wisconsin GOP tweeted July 7, 2020. Two of Wisconsin’s Democrat-led cities did drastically reduce the number of polling places open on election day. But was the decision really in order to cause chaos, particularly during a pivotal election for their party?  Let’s dive in. When asked for evidence to support the party’s claim, Wisconsin GOP spokeswoman Alesha Guenther zeroed in on Milwaukee and Green Bay. ""The majority of Wisconsin’s local elected leaders worked hard to make sure that Wisconsinites could safely exercise their right to vote in person on April 7,"" Guenther said. ""As a result, election day voting went smoothly in almost all areas of the state, with the exceptions of Green Bay and Milwaukee, where local officials refused to use the resources made available to them and caused chaos."" Both cities are indeed led by Democrats -- Tom Barrett in Milwaukee and Eric Genrich in Green Bay. Barrett is a former congressman, and Genrich represented Wisconsin’s 90th Assembly District for three terms.  The mayors came out strongly against holding an in-person election, with Barrett calling it ""dangerous,"" and both urged people to vote absentee. Genrich and Green Bay went one step further and unsuccessfully sued state officials, including Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, to push them to make the election an all-mail process. Milwaukee and Green Bay also had the worst voting lines in the state, opening them up to criticism from state Republicans and local council members. While Guenther emphasized Milwaukee and Green Bay, the party’s original statement cited Democrats in large cities. So, it’s worth noting that the election in Madison, which is also led by a Democratic mayor, went smoothly and wasn’t mired by the same issues. The main thrust of the claim, though, is that Democrats -- including Barrett and Genrich -- closed polling locations to ""cause chaos.""  Let’s take a walk down memory lane.  Milwaukee operated just five polling places on April 7, down from 180 sites, which city officials attributed to a lack of poll workers. Only 300 to 400 people confirmed they would work election day in a city that typically requires more than 1,400 to run the polls for a normal election. In Green Bay, people waited in line up to four hours to vote at two high schools -- the only polling locations in a city accustomed to 31. Nineteen poll workers staffed the two sites with the help of some volunteers after many declined to work over health concerns. Genrich repeatedly said he didn’t feel comfortable asking city employees or volunteers to work the polls mid-pandemic.  In the email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Guenther said Milwaukee and Green Bay failed to take advantage of National Guard members made available to municipalities on Election Day. But the story is more complicated than that. Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson said he received a final tally of available guard workers late on the Sunday before the election and contacted municipal clerks that night. The city of Milwaukee ended up with about 200 volunteers from the guard. Neil Albrecht, then-executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, said receiving that information sooner ""could have influenced the number of voting centers."" Albrecht also said he contacted the state weeks before the election about National Guard assistance, but was told they wouldn’t be dispatched to help run polling sites. Green Bay officials echoed the assertion that National Guard support came too late.  Brown County Clerk Sandy Juno said after the election that Green Bay declined to use poll workers provided by the National Guard. Genrich told the Green Bay Press-Gazette that he didn’t hear anything concrete about guard workers until speaking to Juno days before the election. By then, the city had consolidated to two polling locations and believed it had enough workers to manage them. Now, back to the GOP’s claim. Public statements from Barrett and Genrich suggest the move to consolidate polling places was driven by public health fears and a significant decline in poll workers. And election decisions are not made unilaterally by the mayor of any city.  What’s more, much of the chaos came amid late developing court cases, including one that Republican leaders themselves took to the U.S. Supreme Court. Justices issued their ruling less than 18 hours before polls opened, just hours after Evers attempted to delay the election. And the GOP doesn’t offer a suggestion, let alone evidence, as to why Democrats would have benefited from any chaos -- particularly when races on the ballot included the Democratic presidential primary and a statewide Supreme Court race that pitted a liberal candidate against a conservative one.  In Milwaukee, Barrett himself was on the ballot in his successful bid for a fourth term.  In a tweet, the Wisconsin GOP said, ""Democratic Mayors in some of Wisconsin's largest cities closed voting locations in April to cause chaos."" There’s no question that Milwaukee and Green Bay had problems unlike anywhere else in the state, and their Democratic leaders weren’t shy about wanting to avoid an in-person election amid a public health crisis.  But the decision to consolidate polling places ultimately came down to poll worker shortages, and there was plenty of confusion due to legal maneuvering -- including from the GOP -- up until the last moments before election day. There’s no evidence to suggest the cities wanted to deliberately cause chaos, or that Democrats stood to benefit if they did. We rate this claim False.

No, Congo doctor didn’t say he resigned from COVID-19 response team over cases being falsified
","You may have seen some recent Facebook posts that claim Dr. Denis Mukwege, a renowned doctor from the Democratic Republic of Congo, said he resigned from the Congolese COVID-19 response team because he was asked to falsify COVID-19 case and death numbers. Mukwege did resign, but it wasn’t for those reasons. Mukwege is a Congolese gynecologist and surgeon who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018 along with Nadia Murad for their work to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.  The post displays a photo of Mukwege and claims he said this about resigning from the team:  ""I cannot in any case dirty my Nobel Peace Prize for money, we had been ordered to declare any illness to be coronavirus and any death. In addition, the thing that displeased me is that, after more than 100 samples none came out positive. I have a career to protect and I am Congolese by blood. Getting rich by lying is a sin before God, I quit."" The quote is fake. Mukwege said he resigned because of problems that included inadequate preventive measures and inefficient testing. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Mukwege served as vice chairman of the Multi-sectoral Coronavirus Response Committee and president of the Health Commission, which were established in Congo’s South Kivu province to handle its COVID-19 pandemic response. Mukwege released a statement about his decision to resign from the committee on June 10 on the website for the Panzi Foundation, a charitable organization he founded. He said the decision was due to slow testing, problems implementing a response strategy and inadequate preventative measures. ""We are therefore at the start of an exponential epidemiological curve and we can no longer apply a strategy that would only be preventive,"" Mukwege wrote.  ""I therefore decided to resign from my duties as Vice-President of the Multi-sectoral Coronavirus Response Committee in our province and President of the Health Commission, in order to devote myself entirely to my medical responsibilities and to treat this influx of patients at Panzi Hospital."" A Panzi Foundation spokesperson also confirmed to PolitiFact that the quote is fabricated.

Allegation of racial bias in Wisconsin Amber Alerts unfounded, data shows
","Cell phones across Wisconsin received the all-too-familiar pop-up on July 6, 2020 — an Amber Alert had been issued for a missing child. Kodie Dutcher, 10, went missing from her home in Baraboo about 4 p.m., and the search for her went on through the night. The story ended sadly the next morning when searchers found her body. The death was later ruled to be suicide. In a nation rife with racial tension in the wake of George Floyd’s death and the ensuing police brutality protests, even this story drew questions. Several widely shared Facebook posts raised the role of race in the widespread alert system. ""So Amber Alert works for kids in Baraboo but not Black kids in Milwaukee,"" one Facebook post stated July 6. The text was accompanied by a ""thinking"" emoji. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). The writer’s use of the word ""works"" muddles the issue a bit, since the item was posted before the girl’s body was found, showing the alert unfortunately had not worked. So we’ll interpret that to be a general reference to which children are the subjects of Amber Alerts. Is the poster right to allege racial bias? We’ll check it out, but first, there’s some important background to note. The first slew of comments on the Facebook post supported the statement, with posters saying they thought the same thing. Later comments were more critical of the post as news of the tragic outcome spread. The post likely spread in part because in Milwaukee, particularly in the Black community, there are concerns police do not respond quickly enough in missing child cases. This issue came sharply into focus in a bizarre incident June 23, 2020, in which a civilian-led search for two teenage girls spiralled over the course of several hours to involve three people shot, 10 officers and a firefighter injured, police firing tear gas and rubber bullets into a crowd and protesters setting fire to a house they believed to be connected to the girls and sex trafficking.  Police later said there was no evidence of sex trafficking and that the girls hadn’t met the criteria for an Amber Alert since authorities had no reason to believe their lives were in danger. The girls, ages 13 and 15, were later found several miles away. An hourslong livestream of the situation included one community activist talking about the difficulty of ""getting a missing person’s report going,"" and how community members had set up their own system for missing people on social media. Some comments on the Facebook post about Amber Alerts referenced this incident. Wisconsin has been issuing Amber Alerts since 2003, but only 41 alerts have been sent out in that span, according to state Department of Justice records. That’s a rate of just over two per year. The Amber Alert tally is low because incidents must meet strict criteria for an alert to be issued: The child (or children) must be 17 years of age or younger. The child must be in danger of serious bodily harm or death.  The initiating agency must have enough descriptive information about the child, the suspect and/or the suspect’s vehicle to believe an immediate broadcast alert will help locate the child. Any law enforcement agency in the state can request an Amber Alert, and DOJ personnel then decide whether an alert is justified. If approved, the information is sent to TV and radio stations, cell phones, highway message boards, lottery terminals and other locations. A similar Amber Alert system is used in all 50 states. With that background, let’s dig into the alerts issued in Wisconsin. Among the 41 alerts issued since the program began here, 18 were for Black children, 15 were for white children and eight were for children listed as Hispanic, Native American or unknown, according to DOJ records. Put another way, Black residents account for 6.7% of the population in Wisconsin but have been the subject of 44% of the Amber Alerts. The breakdown by agency shows Milwaukee uses this system far more than any other municipality — hardly a surprise given its size. The Milwaukee Police Department was the initiating agency for 11 of the 41 alerts. That’s more than 25% of the alerts, even though Milwaukee has about 10% of the state’s population. Every one of the Milwaukee alerts was for a Black child. Green Bay had the second-highest tally with three. The Barron County Sheriff’s Office and police in Eau Claire, Racine and Baraboo also issued two. The last two alerts were from Baraboo, the other sent in February 2020 for a missing 15-year-old girl who was later found.  To be sure, the frustration that underlies the post may be more about whether the system is used often enough — particularly when it comes to Black children. To make that determination, however, one would need to understand the circumstances of each case, and whether ones that met the criteria were not issued. In the post at hand, though, the claim — strictly speaking — is about whether it is used at all in cases of missing Black children, or whether it is disproportionately used for non-Black children. By those measures, the claim is off. A widely shared Facebook post said Amber Alerts are issued for white kids, ""but not Black kids in Milwaukee."" It grew out of concerns in the Black community that missing children are not taken serious enough in Milwaukee. But the data actually shows a disproportionate high number of alerts — based on population — have been issued precisely for Black children in Milwaukee. Nearly half of all alerts involved Black children, even though only about 1 in 15 state residents is Black. And more than one-fourth of all alerts were initiated by Milwaukee police — all for Black children. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B327C0>],/factchecks/2020/jul/13/facebook-posts/says-amber-alerts-are-issued-white-kids-not-black-/

Tucker Carlson claims coronavirus ‘poses virtually zero threat’ to children, most teachers
","Fox News host Tucker Carlson downplayed the risk of the coronavirus recently, arguing on his TV show that schools should reopen because, he said, the virus ""poses virtually zero threat"" to children and most working adults. ""For children, the risks of staying locked at home are high,"" Carlson said in the July 7 segment. ""The risks from the coronavirus, by contrast, are not high.""  ""The virus is deadly to the very old and to those who are already sick. We know that,"" he continued. ""But to children and the vast majority of young and middle-aged adults and the vast majority of teachers, it poses virtually zero threat."" The risk of death from COVID-19 does increase with age and for people with underlying medical conditions, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. The CDC’s demographic data shows that older adults account for the majority of COVID-19 deaths. But ""poses virtually zero threat"" is a loaded phrase, experts said. Carlson’s language paints a black-and-white picture between death and full recovery. A lot can happen in between those two outcomes. ""COVID is definitely not ‘zero threat’ in any of these age groups,"" said Cindy Prins, a clinical associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida. RELATED: Donald Trump’s false claim that 99% of COVID-19 cases are harmless Fox News pointed to a handful of studies, articles, state statistics and CDC model estimates that identified children and young adults as less likely to fall severely ill or die from the coronavirus. Case fatality rates do rise with age, a recent CDC report on U.S. cases through May 30 shows. Death is the worst — but least likely — outcome for COVID-19 patients. Counting deaths and calculating fatality rates can be tricky, since deaths due to COVID-19 may be undercounted and epidemiologists still don’t know the exact number of people who were infected. The CDC provides age-related data as part of its provisional death counts, which lag by a few weeks because they are based on death certificates. The data through July 4 showed the breakdown of cumulative, confirmed COVID-19 deaths to look like this:    ""Among adults, the risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at highest risk,"" the CDC says on its website.  That doesn’t mean there’s zero threat facing children and the other age groups. Healthy children can still get and spread the virus, although the CDC says children account for a relatively small share of cases. Working-age adults are susceptible to it, too. RELATED: Some COVID-19 deaths have been children In fact, people between the ages of 18 and 64 represented roughly 75% of all U.S. COVID-19 cases as of July 12, according to CDC data. The average age of teachers in 2017-18, the latest year for which data is available, was about 43 years old, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.  Across all schools, 15.1% of teachers were under age 30; 55.7% were ages 30 to 49; 11.6% were 50 to 54; and 17.6% were 55 or older. Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine, is on a task force advising a local school district in Orange County, where roughly 24% of COVID-19 deaths as of July 9 were patients between 25 and 64 years old. ""I'm thinking of teachers, teachers aides, school nurses, lunchroom staff, administrators, custodial staff and so on,"" Noymer wrote in an email. ""Twenty-four percent of county-wide mortality in this age group is hard to dismiss!"" And it’s not just a matter of death versus no consequences. By most standards, for example, anything that results in a hospitalization has done significant damage. The likelihood of hospitalization rises with age, according to the CDC, but patients of all ages are at risk. Using data from the recent CDC report on U.S. cases through May 30, we calculated that roughly 7.8% of U.S. COVID-19 patients under the age of 60 were hospitalized in that time, including about 5.3% of patients under 60 who reported no underlying medical conditions. There’s also plenty left to learn about the long-term effects of infection, experts said. Donald Thea, professor of global health at Boston University, told us that ""mild disease is oftentimes far from mild and can entail profound and prolonged disability."" Scientists suspect there could be links between mild cases and blood clots, chronic fatigue, strokes and other ailments in young people, according to reports.  Doctors have also found some cases in which children previously infected with COVID-19 have developed a rare condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome. ""The more and more we learn, we’re seeing things about what this virus can do that we didn’t see from the studies in China or in Europe,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, during a May 12 Senate hearing. ""I think we better be careful (that) we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects."" We also don’t know how schools could change the spread and impact of the coronavirus, said Prins, the University of Florida epidemiologist. ""If you’re opening up and sending kids back to school, you’re under a whole different set of circumstances."" Carlson said, ""To children and the vast majority of young and middle-aged adults and the vast majority of teachers, (the coronavirus) poses virtually zero threat."" The risk of dying from COVID-19 does increase with age. But Carlson’s claim that the virus ""poses virtually zero threat"" to the groups he identified ignores the possibility that people from those groups could still wind up sick, hospitalized or facing long-term health conditions. Many teachers are in the particularly vulnerable age groups.

No proof that nasal swabs, the preferred COVID test, are ‘implanting something’
","Could coronavirus testers be doing more than just testing with their nasal swabs? An ominous Facebook post suggests that instead of just retrieving a sample with a swab to test for the presence of COVID-19, testers are ""implanting something."" The post, shared 320,000 times, argues it this way: ""1) Modern Science can take a swab from the inside of your cheek and do a COMPLETE DNA MAPPING. 2) If this COVID-19 is so CONTAGIOUS that tiny microscopic particles of Saliva in your MOUTH could spread out in excess of 6 feet and you need to wear a mask to stop the Spread. WHY not Swab the inside of your HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS MOUTH ? 3) When you tilt your head back are you sure that is just a Q-Tip going 6 inches up your nose ? - Is it possible that instead of retreiving a SAMPLE, they could actually be IMPLANTING SOMETHING ? ? ?

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Tests that extract samples from where the nasal cavity connects with the throat are considered the most accurate, and there is no evidence of testers implanting anything. Here’s how the test is described by Dr. Micah Bhatti, an infectious-diseases professor at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston: ""The person conducting the test will insert a long stick with a very soft brush on the end — kind of like a pipe cleaner — up your nose and twirl it around for a few seconds. The soft bristles will collect a sample of secretions there for analysis. The swab has to go pretty far back, because cells and fluids must be collected from along the entire passageway that connects the base of the nose to the back of the throat to get a really good specimen. ""Tests can be performed on other specimen types that are less invasive, such as a throat swab. But they are less sensitive than the COVID-19 nasal swab test. Saliva is another specimen type that is being explored, but the jury is still out on that one."" The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends upper respiratory system tests. And the Mayo Clinic says: ""Though not considered the best way to get a good sample, a saliva test may be done if discomfort is an issue with a nose or throat swab."" Similar conspiracy theories have emerged about the tests and have been debunked: We rated as Pants on Fire a claim that ""the spot where they are ‘getting a sample’ for the COVID-19 test is called your Blood-Brain Barrier."" The swabs do not go anywhere near the blood-brain barrier, the name given to the unique protective properties found in blood vessels that supply blood to the central nervous system. And there is no evidence that getting a COVID-19 test could cause anything more serious than temporary irritation. We rated as False a claim that Bill Gates and George Soros want to ""secretly stick you with a chip while testing you for the coronavirus."" There was no evidence to back the claim. A number of fact-checks, including by USA Today and AFP Fact Check, also found no evidence for the implanting theory.  A Facebook post claims COVID-19 testing could be done with mouth swabs, so maybe deeper swabbing is ""implanting something.""

Yes, New York has more corrupt officials than any other state
","Lawmakers led away in handcuffs seem like clear signs of a corruption problem in New York State. But the worst in the nation? Elaine Phillips says that’s the case. The Republican is running for a vacant State Senate seat on Long Island, and she has made public corruption in Albany the centerpiece of her campaign. She outlined her plan for state ethics reform in a Facebook post, in which she claimed New York State leads the nation in lawmakers in trouble with the law. ""Over the past decade in Albany, more than 30 current and former state officeholders have been convicted, sanctioned or accused of wrongdoing — more than any other state,"" Phillips said in the post. She referenced the number from an article in the New York Times. Phillips took that claim a step further by saying New York led the pack in corruption among other states. In Albany, running afoul of the law is bipartisan, and not just for backbenchers. Two of the state’s legislative leaders were convicted of corruption charges, former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, and former Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, a Long Island Republican. Phillips, mayor of the Nassau County village of Flower Hill, faces Adam Haber, a Democrat who most recently served with the Nassau Interim Finance Authority Board, which monitors the county’s finances. So is Phillips right? Can New York State be the worst in a nation that includes politicians from Illinois - think Rod Blagojevich - and Louisiana, where a recent headline read ""New Orleans FBI chief calls political corruption in Louisiana ‘robust’""? Struggle with corruption The New York Times, The Buffalo News and other publications have chronicled more than 30 corruption cases in the past decade. Dr. Jeffrey Milyo and Scott Delhommer from the University of Missouri have compiled a database that focuses specifically on public corruption at the state level across the country. Their research focuses on state legislators, high-ranking executive branch officials, and supreme court justices. They tracked bribery, influence peddling and theft of public funds among other charges. Other studies have looked solely at federal convictions or public officials at all levels of government. The Missouri researchers are the only ones who looked at corruption through a state lens, the kind of cases Phillips talks about. From 2006 - 2015, the Missouri researchers identified 28 corruption cases dealing with state officials in New York. Include 2005, and that number rises to 30.  That puts New York first for the number of public corruption cases, followed by Pennsylvania, where 24 cases have been filed over the past decade. New Jersey ranks third with 12 corruption cases. Look further back, and New York State has topped the list since at least 1986, Milyo said. ""Historically, New York has struggled with corruption and continues to do so,"" said Jennifer Rodgers, executive director of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity. ""While measuring corruption is a challenge, I think it's fair to say that New York remains one of the most corrupt states if not the most corrupt state.""

The corruption in New York State is likely rooted in culture, Rodgers says.

""Much of corruption is cultural, and in New York that means that you have to think about the way the New York political system has developed over more than 200 years,"" Rodgers said. ""So you start with these corrupt political machines like Tammany Hall, and over time the problem replicates itself as the next generation figures out how things work and how much corruption will be tolerated, and so on down the line. We've made some progress, of course, but not enough."" Our ruling In her pitch for ethics reform, Phillips said in a Facebook post that ""over the past decade in Albany, more than 30 current and former state officeholders have been convicted, sanctioned or accused of wrongdoing — more than any other state."" She’s right. The analysis from the University of Missouri researchers shows New York State has had more state lawmakers and statewide officials running afoul of the law. She could have gone further. The data shows New York State has led the nation in public corruption for decades.

Ad hitting Patrick Murphy revives zombie statistic of 300,000 losing plans due to Obamacare
","Florida’s closely watched U.S. Senate race pits incumbent Republican Marco Rubio against Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy. Recently, Rubio got some help from the free-market group Americans for Prosperity, which created an ad attacking Murphy as ""Pay-More Patrick."" One of the claims in the ad was an attack on Murphy’s support for the Affordable Care Act, a law sometimes called Obamacare after the president who signed it into law. In the ad, a narrator says, ""Patrick Murphy says he wants to serve in the U.S. Senate, but who does he really want to serve? As a member of Congress, ‘Pay-More’ Patrick has voted for big payouts to special interests. Our health care premiums are going up, and 300,000 Floridians have lost their health insurance. And yet, ‘Pay-More’ Patrick voted not once, not twice, but nine times for Obamacare."" Here, we’ll check the assertion that ""300,000 Floridians have lost their health insurance"" as a result of Obamacare. Where the number came from The 300,000 figure has a long history. As we have noted previously, it stems from the 300,000 policyholders in October 2013 who received notices from the insurance company Florida Blue that their insurance plans didn’t meet the new rules under the Affordable Care Act. Those rules were intended to phase out ""bare bones"" plans that didn’t include features like prescription drug coverage or hospital stays. Florida Blue sent those 300,000 customers letters informing them that their plans would end and offering guidance on how to get signed up for a new plan. ""Florida Blue is proactively communicating to these members to help them understand how this transition affects them,"" the company said at the time. ""Prior to their 2014 renewal date, each member will receive a letter that instructs them to contact Florida Blue to review their migration options. These new plans will offer members access to more comprehensive benefits in 2014."" Opponents of the Affordable Care Act seized on the 300,000 number as a sign of problems for the newly implemented law, and it became an issue during the 2014 campaign cycle. Twice, we took issue with the use of the statistic for not providing full context about the number. Rubio himself earned a Mostly False for saying, ""300,000 people are going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare. Now those people next year, they don’t have health insurance."" Since the company provided assistance with switching plans, we argued that Rubio was jumping the gun by saying flatly that they wouldn’t have insurance. What has happened since? So what happened to those 300,000 people in the succeeding three years? As it turns out, the vast majority of the 300,000 found coverage -- with Florida Blue. ""More than 80 percent of the approximately 300,000 members remained with Florida Blue,"" company spokesman Paul C. Kluding told PolitiFact. That would leave at most 60,000 people -- not 300,000 -- who lost their health insurance as a result of that provision of the law. But even that number is probably high. Remember, the 80 percent figure refers to the policyholders who remained with Florida Blue. But the other 20 percent didn’t necessarily become uninsured -- they just didn’t get a Florida Blue plan. They could have found another private plan, or they could have found other private insurance -- including a plan purchased on one of the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. So at the very least, the ad reanimates a years-old number that was known to be preliminary and in flux. Florida’s new insurance signups The use of the 300,000 number is misleading in a second way: It ignores the coverage gains of the Affordable Care Act in the state. More than 1.7 million Floridians purchased plans through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces between Nov. 1, 2015, and Feb. 1, 2016. And the number affected by the law could have been many more if Florida had moved to expand Medicaid under the law, as many other states did. This is a big enough increase to wipe out the 300,000 policies ""lost"" -- which, as we noted, is an exaggerated number -- and it positively dwarfs the 60,000 number, which itself might be exaggerated. The impact of the Affordable Care Act on Florida can be seen clearly in newly released federal data on uninsured residents in every state. In 2013, 20 percent of Floridians lacked health coverage. In 2014, that number fell to 16.6 percent, and in 2015, it fell again to 13.3 percent. That’s a decrease in Florida’s uninsured population by one-third over two years. Americans for Prosperity responds Andres Malave, a spokesman for Americans for Prosperity, made several arguments for why the message of the ad was valid. One is that those 300,000 faced administrative headaches in continuing their insurance or finding a new plan, sometimes more than once. He also had a point that not all of the 1.7 million residents who purchased a marketplace plan were uninsured before that. However, the overall uninsured rates suggest that many people were indeed moving from uninsured to insured over the previous two years. (Malave argued that the recovering economy in the state deserves credit for the higher insurance coverage rates, rather than just the Affordable Care Act.) Our ruling Americans for Prosperity said that ""300,000 Floridians have lost their health insurance"" as a result of Obamacare. Even in 2013 this assertion was not entirely correct, and now, more than three years later, we know it’s not correct. Only about 60,000 people failed to re-up with Florida Blue, and there’s a good chance that many of those 60,000 found coverage elsewhere -- including through the Obamacare exchanges. Indeed, in the most recent year, the Obamacare marketplace has enabled 1.7 million Floridians to sign up for coverage, a far bigger number than the losses cited in the ad. Finally, the uninsured rate in Florida has fallen by one-third since 2013, which paints a very different picture than the ad’s zombie statistic.

","Hillary Clinton promised to ""connect more Latinos with good-paying jobs that pay good wages"" when she spoke on Sept. 15, 2016, at the 39th Annual Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Public Policy Conference and Annual Awards Gala in Washington. ""We need to create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top,"" the Democratic presidential candidate said. ""There's something wrong when Latinos are 17 percent of our country's population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth."" We decided to fact-check those percentages, recognizing that although the federal government considers Latino to be synonymous with Hispanic, many people make a distinction. Because we'll be using government data, we'll consider the terms comparable. First, a bit of history. The Great Recession had a much more devastating effect on Hispanics than on whites. The Pew Research Center found that while median wealth for whites fell 16 percent after the collapse of the housing market and the subsequent recession, it fell by 66 percent for Hispanic households. Wealth includes all savings, investments and property, minus the value of debt, such as car loans, mortgages and credit card debt. In 2009, median net worth for whites was $113,149. It was $6,325 for Hispanics. Four years earlier, the numbers were $134,992 for whites, $18,359 for Hispanics. ""Hispanics (were) hit hardest by the meltdown in the housing market,"" the Pew report said.   When it comes to specific percentages, the Clinton campaign sent us two two reports. The first was from the Census Bureau, which pegged the Hispanic population at 17 percent as of July 1, 2014. That confirms the first part of Clinton's statement. The second was a 2014 analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, part of the federal reserve system. It predicts that the wealth owned by Hispanic families in total dollars will triple by 2025, although most of the extra wealth ""would result from the Hispanic population growing faster than other groups"" rather than individual Hispanics gaining more wealth. The report uses 2010 data (when Hispanics made up 16.3 percent of the United States population). The St. Louis Fed calculated that in 2010 Hispanics represented about 2.2 percent of the total wealth in the country. That's that 2 percent Clinton was referring to. At the time, median wealth for an Hispanic family was $15,000 versus $77,000 for the entire U.S. population. We sought newer data by turning to Pew, where Richard Fry, a senior economist, used 2013 household data collected by the Federal Reserve. ""The nation’s total wealth was $64.7 trillion,"" he told us via email. ""The nation’s 13 million Hispanic households owned about $1.5 trillion of that $64.7 trillion, so yes, Hispanic households owned about 2 percent of the nation’s wealth in 2013."" The actual ratio: 2.3 percent. The current outlook for individual Hispanics is not very good. The Fed estimated that the Hispanic share of the economy's total wealth would rise by 2025 to either 2.6 percent or 3.2 percent, depending on the projection used. But that would be because the Hispanic population is growing significantly, not because individual families would be making a lot more money. ""If it were not for the faster rate of population growth projected for the Hispanic population,"" the Fed concluded, ""the wealth shares in 2025 would be 2.0 or 2.4 percent — that is, either a small decline or a small increase from their 2010 shares. Thus, relatively rapid population growth in the Hispanic population is likely to be an important contributor to the rising share of total wealth owned by Hispanics."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""Latinos are 17 percent of our country's population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth."" Census Bureau data confirm the 17 percent. Federal reserve data from 2010 and more recent data from 2013 show that the 2 percent figure is on target as well. We rate the claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FA3F40>],/factchecks/2016/sep/19/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-correct-hispanic-wealth-disproport/

GOP makes complicated claim that Tim Kaine 'hiked tuition' as governor
","Tim Kaine’s national call this year to make a college education more affordable clashes with his record when he was governor of Virginia, according to the Republican National Committee. Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, wrote a Sept. 12 op-ed in Time magazine touting proposals by Hillary Clinton, his running mate, to cut college costs. He said the ticket’s goal is to make a college education debt-free for everyone and tuition-free for in-state students from families who earn less than $125,000 a year. In explaining how the plan would work, Kaine wrote, ""institutions and states alike will have to commit to lowering costs and raising their own investments in education if they want to continue receiving federal funding."" The RNC fired back the same day with a blog post headlined, ""Tim Kaine hiked tuition as governor, but now claims to champion affordability."" We investigated the RNC’s statement. We’ll start with the easy part, that Kaine now ""claims to champion affordability."" This is self-evident. Kaine wrote in the op-ed that the Democratic ticket’s plan ""will help anyone willing to work for a quality, affordable college degree."" Now, let’s look at the thornier part: whether ""Kaine hiked tuition"" when he was governor from January 2006 to January 2010. While reading this, keep in mind that Virginia’s fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30. So when Kaine took office, tuition for the 2005-06 budget year already was set. The average cost for in-state tuition and instructional fees at four-year institutions - not including room and board - was $3,812. It rose to $5,003 in fiscal 2009-10, when Kaine left office. That’s a 31.2 percent increase. Adjusted for inflation, it's about a 19 percent rise. The average cost for tuition and instructional fees at Virginia’s community colleges rose from $2,182 in the 2005-06 school year to $2,716 in 2009-10. That’s a 24.5 percent increase. Adjusted for inflation, it's about a 13 percent rise. Sure enough, tuition did go up during Kaine’s term. But did Kaine ""hike"" tuition, as the RNC says? The answer is complicated. Technically, Kaine didn’t raise the rates. Virginia’s public colleges largely are autonomous, and have had freedom under the last four governors to set their own tuition. Kaine, however, did have a role in setting political conditions early in his term that made it easy for colleges to raise tuition and budget conditions later in his administration that pressured colleges to keep increasing them. Virginia colleges usually generate about 82 percent of their revenues through tuition, fees and grants, according to data from the House Appropriations Committee. The remaining 18 percent is allocated by the General Assembly. It comes from the state’s general fund, which is raised mostly through income and sales taxes. Kaine, when he entered the governor’s mansion half way through fiscal 2005-06, inherited a $1.45 billion general fund budget for higher education. That rose to $1.76 billion in the 2007-08 budget year. Despite that healthy increase, in-state tuition and fees went up cumulatively by about 17 percent during the first two years of Kaine’s administration, according to figures from the State Council for Higher Education in Virginia. Although Kaine expressed concern about the rising rates, we were unable to find an instance in which he publicly castigated colleges for their stewardship. Neither he nor the General Assembly tried to cap in-state tuition increases at the inflation rate - a restraint that was used during the consecutive governorships of Republicans George Allen and Jim Gilmore from 1994 to 2002. Kaine said he would favor such a cap only if the state significantly raised its funding of colleges. In late 2008, Virginia began to feel the sting of the Great Recession and Kaine began ordering massive cuts in state spending. They included a $341 million reduction in the general fund contribution to colleges during the final two budget years of his term. Tuition increased by about 13 percent during that two-year period. In 2012, when Kaine was running successfully for the U.S. Senate, state Republicans said the college cuts ordered by Kaine drove up tuition. Indeed, college officials did warn during the recession that they would have to recoup money by raising student costs. But it should be noted that all of the spending levels Kaine recommended for colleges and universities - within a few dollars - were in state budgets that were approved with overwhelming bipartisan support in the General Assembly.   We also should point out that before, during and after the recession, Virginia colleges have been raising tuition and fees well beyond the rate of inflation. The average annual increase during the past 15 school years has been 7.2 percent, according to SCHEV. Inflation has increased by an average of about 2.3 percent annually during the same span, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Virginia’s experience wasn’t unique when Kaine was governor; tuition and fees for in-state students at four-year public universities rose across the U.S. during his term. The U.S. Department of Education said the national average increased by 23 percent during that span; the College Board says costs rose by 29 percent. Our ruling The RNC says, ""Tim Kaine hiked tuition as governor, but now claims to champion affordability."" As the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Kaine clearly is taking on college affordability by advocating debt-free college for everyone and tuition-free education for in-state students from families making less than $125,000 a year. When Kaine was governor from 2006 to 2010, in-state tuition and instructional fees rose 31.2 percent at four-year colleges and 24.5 percent at community colleges. But it’s misleading to say Kaine ""hiked"" the rates. Colleges largely are autonomous in Virginia and allowed to set their own student costs. Tuition has been rising steadily in Virginia and across the nation for decades. On the other hand, Virginia’s governor and its legislature do create political and budgetary conditions that can encourage or discourage colleges from steep tuition increases. While Kaine did not pull the lever for the tuition hikes, they did occur under his watch. So on the whole, we rate the RNC’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809703E9C0>],/factchecks/2016/sep/19/republican-national-committee-republican/gop-makes-tricky-claim-tim-kaine-hiked-tuition-gov/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Donald Trump']","
Trump says in few years, immigrant share of population will break records
","Donald Trump has made immigration a focal point of his presidential campaign, proposing to build a wall to curb illegal immigration, to reinstate and expand deportation programs, and to put in place ideological certifications for those who want to come to the United States. In an immigration speech in Arizona, Trump also said he wanted restrictions on future immigration. He said many of the millions of immigrants admitted into the United States ""have greatly enriched our country,"" but there is now ""an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration."" ""Within just a few years, immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records,"" Trump said Aug. 31. That got us wondering: Will the share of foreign-born population soon set new highs? We’ll start with a few points to keep in mind about what Trump said: • ""Within just a few years"" is a bit vague and can be relative. But by definition, few is a small number. • ""Immigration as a share of national population"" does not distinguish between illegal immigration, his campaign cornerstone, or legal immigration. So our check will include all foreign-born immigrants, living here legally and illegally. • ""Break all historical records"" dates back to 1890, the year to beat. That’s the year when 14.77 percent of the country’s nearly 63 million population was foreign born. Trump’s campaign sent us a September 2015 USA Today article that said a new record would be set in 2025 as the share of the foreign-born population reaches 14.9 percent. The article is based on a report from the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, noting a ""rapid growth"" of the foreign-born share from 4.7 percent in 1970 to 13.1 percent in 2013, and ""approaching a historic high."" ""With our data, we could approximate that it would be some time in 2024 or 2025,"" Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with Pew Research Center, told PolitiFact. ""But our projections definitely support the idea of 2025 exceeding the historic high."" And that’s assuming that immigration between 2020-25 will exceed current pace by about 20 percent to 25 percent, Passel said. ""At current levels of immigration, reaching the high would take a few additional years,"" he said. Census projections The Census Bureau didn’t start asking people where they were born until 1850. From 1850 to 1930, large-scale immigration from Europe contributed to an increase of the foreign-born population in the United States. Now, the majority of the foreign-born population is from Latin America and Asia, according to the bureau. A ""native-born"" resident refers to anyone who is a U.S. citizen at birth, including people born in territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam, as well as people born abroad to a U.S. citizen parent. In March 2015 the bureau released projections on the size and composition of the U.S. population. They are based on assumptions about future births, deaths and net international migration. By 2020, 14.3 percent of a total 334.5 million people will be foreign-born, the bureau forecasts. That’s close to the 1890 record of 14.77 percent. The Census Bureau estimated increases per decade up to 2060, when 18.8 percent of the 416.8 million population is expected to be foreign-born. But more detailed, year-by-year census data is also available based on 2014 projections (table 2). By 2023, 14.79 percent of the population is forecast to be foreign-born -- that’s below the 14.8 percent usually rounded and referenced by Census as the record, but slightly above the actual 1890 figure, 14.77. By 2024, the foreign-born share is projected to be 14.94, definitely surpassing the record, per Census estimates. By 2025, the estimated share is 15.09 percent.  By these yearly measures, Trump’s statement is correct, said Steven Camarota, director of research for Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring strict immigration policies. ""The key thing is that the population is not stable, it keeps going up, unless there is a policy change,"" said Camarota, who co-wrote a report on the Census projections. Our ruling Trump said, ""Within just a few years, immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records."" Historic data and projections suggest the foreign-born population is rising. A new record could be reached in about seven years, according to Census Bureau estimates. Experts also say projections are based assuming future immigration exceeds current pace. At current levels, it may take longer. Trump didn’t specify in how many years the record would be broken, but data points to a probable new record in fewer than 10 years. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C060D80>],/factchecks/2016/sep/19/donald-trump/trump-says-few-years-immigrant-share-population-wi/

Tim Kaine says millennials agree with Clinton, not Trump, on big issues
","Young voters carried Barack Obama to victory in the past two elections and felt the Bern for Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary. But polls show they’re not exactly transferring their enthusiasm to Hillary Clinton.  The 69.2 million millennials — typically defined as adults under age 35 — now make up the second-largest age block in America after the Baby Boomers. While Clinton still leads Donald Trump among young voters, polls show sizable portions of millennials now backing Libertarian Party’s Gary Johnson and Green Party’s Jill Stein. (In comparison, third party candidates received about 3 percent of the vote in 2012.)  Clinton’s trouble connecting with millennials prompted NBC’s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press to ask Clinton’s running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, how the campaign could rebuild the Obama coalition and win swing states without them. Kaine agreed that that young voters are crucial, but laid out ""five litmus test issues"" that should convince them to get with her. ""Do you believe in climate science or don’t you? Millennials do, Hillary Clinton and I do, Donald Trump doesn’t. Do you believe women should be able to make their own health care decisions, or don’t you? Millennials do, Hillary Clinton and I do, Donald Trump doesn’t. Do you believe in immigration reform or don’t you? We do, millennials do, Donald Trump doesn’t. Do you believe in LGBTQ equality? We do, millennials do, Donald Trump doesn’t. And finally, do you have a plan to deal with college affordability? We have one. Millennials need one. And Donald Trump, with Trump University, has ripped off students,"" Kaine said. Does Clinton have more in common with the youth than Trump on the five issues Kaine laid out? We asked the Clinton campaign and Trump campaigns for data showing how millennials feel about the various issues. We didn't hear back from the Trump side. A Clinton spokesman sent us a report that surveyed millennials in only 11 swing states. In addition, it used questions phrased to favor Democratic talking points, such as asking about ""making the wealthy pay their fair share"" and ""implementing common sense gun safety rules."" We will not be using those results. But the campaign later sent us other polling data. In addition, we did our own search. Here's what we found. Climate science Kaine’s assertion on climate change is largely accurate. Recently, a 2014 Gallup survey found that 58 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds believe global warming's effects have already begun. About a year later, a national poll conducted in 2015 by Harvard's Institute of Politics found that 55 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds agreed with the scientific consensus that the planet is warming and emissions ""from cars and industry facilities"" are to blame. But 20 percent said that, although the planet is warming, natural changes in the environment are to blame, which is at odds with the consensus of the experts. Twenty-three percent believe global warming is a ""theory that has not yet been proven.""         Clinton has called for more pollution controls, investing more in clean energy and cutting ""wasteful"" tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. Trump's website doesn’t include a position on climate change. However, the site has reposted a PBS Newshour article that says Trump regards climate change as a hoax. And as we reported in June, during a May 26 energy policy speech Trump advocated rescinding ""all the job-destroying Obama executive actions, including the Climate Action Plan"" and said he would ""cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs."" Women's health care Kaine said that women should be able to make their own health care decisions. Few people would disagree that women — or men for that matter — should be able to make their own health care decisions. In a political context, Kaine’s comments indicate Clinton’s position in favor of abortion rights. A 2014 poll by the nonpartisan organization PRRI (formerly the Public Religion Research Institute) in Washington found that 55 percent of millennials thought abortion should be legal in most or all cases. The same level of support is seen in people under 68. Only older Americans showed less support for abortion, with 43 percent of people over 67 saying it should be legal. Similarly, when Gallup surveyed abortion attitudes in 2015, it found that 53 percent of people age 18 to 34 identified themselves as ""pro choice,"" versus 52 percent of 35- to 55-year-olds and 47 percent of people over 55. Once again, that puts millennials in the Democratic camp, but not by an overwhelming amount. Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin subsequently directed us to a Fox News survey taken last week that found 61 percent of registered voters under age 35 reported being pro-choice. Clinton, as with most Democrats, supports the right of a woman to seek an abortion. Trump doesn't address abortion on his website, but he’s said in interviews that he opposes abortion in most cases. In a March interview, he said women who have an abortion after it’s outlawed should received ""some form of punishment,"" but he backtracked on the idea after widespread criticism. Once again, the Clinton-Kaine team seems to be in synch with at least a bare majority of millennials. Immigration Immigration is another issue where the stances of Trump and Clinton diverge dramatically. Trump has made the removal of illegal immigrants his signature issue. He wants to build a wall across the southern border and change the law that dictates that if you are born in the United States you automatically become as U.S. citizen. Clinton, in contrast, has called for legislation to allow some of those living in the United States illegally to remain, especially young adults brought to the United States as children. Most — criminals are a major exception — would be eligible for an eventual path to citizenship. On the issue of the wall, millennials are firmly against Trump. According to a 2016 PRRI survey, 70 percent oppose it, compared to 52 percent of people age 65 and older. Only 11 percent of Americans age 18 to 29 support identifying and deporting illegal immigrants (it's 23 percent for people age 65 and older), according to a 2015 PRRI poll; and 69 percent of younger voters support a path to citizenship, as do 58 percent of seniors. More recently, a Fox News poll taken in last August found that 87 percent of respondents under 35 favored setting up a system for illegal immigrants to become legal. Only 11 percent supported deporting as many as possible. Also, Trump seems to be out of step with the younger people in his own party, 63 percent of whom support a path to citizenship and only 20 percent want mass deportation. LGBT equality Polls show millennials overwhelmingly support gay rights, which is a plank of Clinton's platform. But Kaine is exaggerating when he suggests Trump is totally against LGBT equality — the Republican nominee has given mixed messages on the issue. An August GenForward survey, conducted by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago and the AP-NORC Center, found that young voters (defined as age 18 to 30) strongly supported LGBT individual rights including equal employment rights (90 percent), HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment (92 percent) and LGBT adoption (80 percent). According to a May 2016 Pew report, 71 percent of Americans born after 1981 favor same-sex marriage (as do 55 percent of all Americans). Clinton’s LGBT promises mirror the attitudes of millennials in the GenForward survey. She calls the Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage in 2015 as a ""landmark victory"" for the country. Kaine, for his part, signed an executive order that banned discrimination based on sexual orientation in Virginia in 2006, his first year as governor. Equality Virginia, the commonwealth's LGBT organization, called him a friend and major ally in an editorial to the Advocate.  Trump, meanwhile, has vowed that he ""will do everything in my power to protect LGBT citizens"" in his speech at the Republican National Convention. He often criticizes the Clinton Foundation for taking donations from governments that oppress gay men and women. But Trump opposes gay marriage and has said in interviews during the Republican primary that he would appoint judges that would reverse the Supreme Court ruling or allow states to decide. The Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights groups that endorsed Clinton, points out that Trump’s running mate is Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who passed a 2015 law that allowed businesses to refuse to serve gay and lesbian customers based on religious freedom; the law was modified after an uproar. College affordability Trump isn’t against making colleges more affordable, but polls show millennial attitudes on higher education costs are more closely aligned with Clinton’s than Trump’s. Many millennials say college affordability is a top issue, according to a USA Today/Rock the Vote survey, and the vast majority say higher education should be debt free (77 percent in a poll commissioned by Bankrate Inc., a financial services company). Under Clinton’s college affordability plan — retooled with input from Sanders in June 2016 and seen as a grab for his millennial voters — families with incomes less than $85,000 will pay no tuition at in-state public colleges and universities, with the income cap increasing to $125,000 by 2021. Clinton’s plan also addresses student debt refinancing. Kaine focused on complaints lodged against Trump University in his Meet the Press interview. We found that Trump University received a D-minus rating from the Better Business Bureau in 2010, the last time the consumer watchdogs gave any rating at all. Trump has been vague about his own college affordability plans. In an Iowa town hall in November 2015, he suggested he would create ""some governmental program"" to help lower-income families pay for school. He promised to ""work with all of our students who are drowning in debt"" during the Republican National Convention. His website does not list college affordability as an issue, but Trump’s policy advisor Sam Clovis floated a few ideas in a May interview with Inside Higher Ed. Clovis said the campaign thinks student loans should be ""market driven,"" and said colleges should ""have skin in the game"" and share the risks associated with student loans. Clovis rejected proposals for free higher public education. Our ruling Kaine said Hillary Clinton and millennials believe in climate change, abortion rights, immigration reform, gay rights and college affordability but ""Donald Trump doesn't."" Reputable polls back Kaine’s claim, though the VP nominee is overstating the extent of Trump’s opposition to gay rights and college affordability. Millennials agree decisively with Clinton’s position on immigration, gay rights and college affordability, and by narrow margins on climate change and abortion rights. We rate Kaine’s claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cb26be5e-6bc8-40b9-8ea0-d1b04acf2a8a",[<zip object at 0x000002809756D940>],/factchecks/2016/sep/18/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-millennials-agree-clinton-not-trump/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'New York', 'Robert Duffy']","
The upstate economy is one of the worst in the country
","Former Lt. Governor Robert Duffy penned an op-ed piece in the Rochester Business Journal urging upstate lawmakers to form their own caucus. Doing so would help them press upstate issues in a state legislature dominated by downstate lawmakers. But upstate New York breaking from downstate entirely? Duffy called the idea ""ludicrous."" ""If we ever did that, the economic indicators of upstate New York would be among the lowest in the country,"" Duffy claimed. ""We do count on downstate to carry much of the load for the economic health of New York."" Calls for upstate to secede from New York State are not new. But secession gained steam last year when upstate advocates pitched the idea at a protest in the Southern Tier. Some were angry over gun control laws passed in 2013. Others were upset by the ban on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, because they believe the gas drilling process would boost that region’s struggling economy. One of the leading secession proponents, the Divide NYS Caucus, hopes for momentum to build ahead of a future Constitutional Convention in New York State. Voters will decide whether to hold a convention in the 2017 general election. Downstate has a bigger population than upstate. The Assembly is comfortably in the hands of lawmakers from New York City and the surrounding area, most of whom are Democrats. The State Senate, meanwhile, is controlled by Republicans, mostly from upstate and Long Island. Is Duffy right? Would upstate’s economy rank low on its own? The Greater Rochester Chamber of Commerce was not able to tell us which economic indicators Duffy was referring to. We looked at two indicators typically used to measure the economy - unemployment and wages - to check his claim. The unemployment scorecard As of July, the statewide unemployment rate was 4.7 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. That’s better than the national average of 4.9 percent. But New York State still ranks 25th in the nation, tied with three other states. Duffy says the line dividing upstate from downstate is the same used in this year’s minimum wage hike. In that deal, New York City, Long Island, and Westchester County were given a different timeline to reach the higher wage than the rest of the state. Our analysis uses the same method: We define upstate as everything north of New York City except for Westchester County. There’s no data publicly available that shows unemployment for this definition of upstate. We used county-level data from state and federal databases to evaluate Duffy’s claim. The unemployment rate in upstate New York is 4.6 percent, according to the latest data from the state Department of Labor. That number is an average of the counties we’ve defined as upstate. That’s better than the statewide average and would rank 23rd in the nation - ahead of the statewide ranking. The wage scorecard Income per capita is different than the average wage. It measures how much money someone takes in, whether it’s earned at a job or not, instead of just measuring how much a job pays. We looked at both. In upstate, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the per capita income was $40,123 at the end of 2014, the latest county-level data. Upstate would have ranked 37th in the nation that year, below the national average of $46,049. New York State as a whole ranked fifth that year. As for wages, only Washington, D.C., had a higher average wage than New York State’s $67,521.  The national average is $52,942. The average wage upstate was $42,287 by the end of 2015, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. If it was its own state, upstate would rank 44th for wages, ahead of South Carolina but behind New Mexico. Our ruling Duffy wrote in the Rochester Business Journal that ""the economic indicators of upstate New York would be among the lowest in the country"" if the region split from downstate. We compared national data on unemployment and wages to county-level data to rate his claim. With Duffy’s definition of upstate New York, unemployment is close to the national average while wages and income are among the lowest in the country according to the latest data. We rate this claim as Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fa7c54fa-de00-4abc-9ed1-8e386ceaf46c",[<zip object at 0x00000280976EF0C0>],/factchecks/2016/sep/16/bob-duffy/upstate-economy-one-worst-country/

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that he 'finished' the Obama birther talk
","After years of promoting the theory that President Barack Obama was born in a foreign country -- one that has been consistently debunked by fact-checkers -- Donald Trump reversed course on Sept. 16, 2016, and said Obama was born in the United States. ""President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period,"" Trump said while briefly addressing the subject at the end of a campaign event at his newly built hotel in Washington. We’ve separately ruled this a Full Flop. But Trump’s other remarks on the so-called ""birther"" controversy have inspired fact-checks of their own. Trump prefaced his statement about Obama’s birthplace by saying, ""Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean."" We rated the first part of that claim that ""Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy"" False. Here, we’ll fact-check the assertion that Trump ""finished it."" We didn’t hear back from the Trump campaign, but the evening before Trump’s announcement in Washington, Jason Miller, a senior communications adviser with the campaign, sent out a news release saying in part, ""In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate. Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised."" So it appears that the campaign’s argument is that Trump pushed for Obama to release the long form of his Hawaii birth certificate on April 27, 2011, several years after the birther controversy bubbled up. Previously, a shorter version of the document had been available, but skeptics had been calling for the full document to be released. Trump himself had made this case as early as Aug. 22, 2013, when he tweeted, ""Why are people upset w/ me over Pres Obama’s birth certificate? I got him to release it, or whatever it was, when nobody else could!"" But for Trump’s argument to hold water, we see two conditions that have to be met. First, did Trump ""finish"" advocating for the birther viewpoint once Obama released the long-form birth certificate? And second, did Obama’s release of the long-form certificate ""finish"" the idea among American voters that Obama was born outside the United States? In both cases, the answer is no. Trump’s continued birther tweets Slate has produced a comprehensive index to the tweets by Trump -- all made after Obama’s document release in 2011 -- in which the real-estate magnate either openly advocated birtherism or promoted skepticism about the official story of Obama’s birth. The list includes about three dozen examples between November 2011 and November 2014. Here’s a sampling: July 17, 2012: ""I wonder what the answer is on @BarackObama's college application to the question: place of birth? Maybe the same as his book cover? Release your records, Mr. President!"" July 20, 2012: ""With @BarackObama listing himself as ""Born in Kenya"" in 1999 http://bit.ly/JaHQW0 HI laws allowed him to produce a fake certificate. #SCAM"" Aug. 6, 2012: ""An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud."" Aug. 27, 2012: ""Why do the Republicans keep apologizing on the so called ""birther"" issue? No more apologies--take the offensive!"" Sept. 13, 2012: ""Wake Up America! See article: ""Israeli Science: Obama Birth Certificate is a Fake"" http://bit.ly/UIfG7B."" June 29, 2014: ""Always remember, I was the one who got Obama to release his birth certificate, or whatever that was! Hilary couldn't, McCain couldn't."" Sept. 6, 2014: ""Attention all hackers: You are hacking everything else so please hack Obama's college records (destroyed?) and check ‘place of birth’"" Public opinion about Obama’s birthplace The birther controversy never actually ended, either, judging by the polls. For starters, the birth certificate release itself didn't eliminate skepticism within the public about Obama’s birthplace -- not even close. At least two surveys looked at the question shortly before and shortly after Obama’s document release. Gallup asked whether respondents would say Obama was ""probably or definitely born in another country"" and found that the number dropped from 24 percent before the release in April 2011 to 13 percent after the release in May 2011. And YouGov asked whether ""Barack Obama was born in the United States."" Before the release, 15 percent of respondent said ""false,"" a number that dropped to 13 percent after the release. Thirteen percent is not a trivial number of people in a nation of more than 300 million people. As time went on, polls by YouGov actually found rising numbers of respondents answering ""false"" ""Barack Obama was born in the United States"" -- 17 percent in January 2012 and 20 percent in July 2012. And as recently as September 2015, a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll found 13 percent answering ""another country"" when asked, ""Where was Barack Obama born, as far as you know?"" That poll was taken more than four years after Obama released his long-form birth certificate. Our ruling Trump said of the birther controversy, ""I finished it."" In no credible sense is this true. Trump didn’t ""finish"" fanning the flames of birther conspiracies once Obama released his long-form birth certificate in April 2011 -- he kept tweeting about it for at least another three and a half years. And a core group of Americans hasn’t ""finished"" expressing birther sentiments. As recently as a year ago, various polls have found that 13 percent of Americans supported the viewpoint.

Fact-checking Donald Trump's claim Hillary Clinton started Obama birther movement
","Donald Trump repeated his debunked claim that Hillary Clinton started the rumors questioning whether President Barack Obama was born in the United States. ""Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy,"" Trump said in a 30-minute press conference Sept. 16, 2016. ""I finished it."" The birther issue reemerged when the Washington Post asked Trump a day earlier if he believes Obama was born in the United States. He refused to answer. ""I’ll answer the question at the right time,"" Trump said Sept. 15. ""I just don’t want to answer it yet."" This prompted a flurry of incredulity over his revitalization of the ""birther"" issue, which in turn prompted his campaign to answer the question for him and also accuse Clinton of starting it in the first place.  Trump has repeatedly claimed that Clinton began the whole issue in the first place. Trump said ""Hillary is a birther"" in February 2015 at CPAC, tweeted that ""she was all in"" in September 2015, and said ""she brought it up years before it was brought up by me"" on CNN in May 2016. The morning of his press conference, Trump brought it up again on Fox Business. PolitiFact and our friends at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact-Checker have debunked this zombie claim multiple times. There is no evidence that Clinton or her 2008 campaign ever floated the theory. While Clinton supporters circulated the allegations the last time she ran for president, they had no ties to either the candidate or her staff. A damning memo? The Sept. 15 Trump campaign statement linked to a 2007 strategy memo published in the Atlantic from former Clinton aide Mark Penn that advises pointing out Obama’s ""lack of American roots.""    While Penn suggests Clinton ""own ‘American’ in our programs,"" that’s not the same thing as suggesting Clinton question Obama’s citizenship or birthplace. The memo never advises that. It also explicitly states, ""We are never going to say anything about his background."" Furthermore, as the Atlantic and Politico reported in 2008, neither Clinton nor her campaign acted on Penn’s advice. A not-damning chain email The other piece of ""evidence"" linking Clinton to birtherism are emails circulated by supporters of Clinton during the last days of the 2008 Democratic primary after Clinton suspended her campaign. According to a Telegraph article, Clinton supporters circulated the ""birther"" theory in an email as early as April 2008. ""Barack Obama’s mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy,"" the email said, according to the Telegraph. ""She was not allowed to travel by plane then, so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth."" The allegations gained momentum that month. Clinton conceded the race on June 7, and three days later a website called Pumaparty.com (an acroynom for Party Unity My A--) encouraged Clinton backers to support Republican nominee Sen. John McCain. The website promoted the theory with an email that read, ""Obama May Be Illegal to Be Elected President,"" as Daily Beast editor John Avlon has documented. According to Avlon, Linda Starr, a Clinton volunteer in Texas, was key to spreading the rumor. She connected with with Philip Berger, an attorney and Clinton supporter, who sued to block Obama’s nomination. The suit was thrown out. But this is not the same thing as Clinton or her campaign promoting the theory. There is no evidence that they ever have done so. Clinton has dismissed the allegation when Trump made his accusation last September in an interview with CNN’s Don Lemon. ""That is — no. That is so ludicrous, Don. You know, honestly, I just believe that, first of all, it’s totally untrue, and secondly, you know, the president and I have never had any kind of confrontation like that,"" Clinton said. ""You know, I have been blamed for nearly everything, that was a new one to me."" (Another thing to note: Clinton volunteers forwarded emails promoting the myth that Obama is a Muslim. As we have previously reported, both resigned from the campaign after they were found to have spread the rumor. The Clinton campaign condemned their actions and said it was unauthorized.) Our ruling Trump said, ""Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy."" There is no evidence to support this. Clinton supporters circulated the rumor in the last days of the 2008 Democratic primary and after Clinton had conceded to Obama. But the record does not show Clinton or her campaign ever promoting the birther theory, let alone starting it.

Fact-checking Democratic attacks on Marco Rubio's statements on Social Security and Medicare
","Two Democratic groups say Republican Sen. Marco Rubio wants to cut Social Security and Medicare -- programs that millions of Florida seniors rely on each year. ""Marco Rubio wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare because he said they’re bankrupting our country. But that’s what politicians say when the insurance industry bankrolls their campaigns. Marco Rubio has taken almost $1 million from the insurance industry which was profit from his privatization plans,"" says the narrator in a TV ad by the Senate Majority PAC and AFSCME People. The PAC aims to elect Democrats to the Senate, including U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, while AFSCME is a union representing public workers. We found that Rubio’s views are much more nuanced than the ad suggests. Rubio’s 2010 Senate campaign About 21 percent of Florida’s population -- about 3.9 million people -- receive Social Security benefits. About 4 million Floridians use Medicare for health insurance. Both programs face long-term financing shortfalls, leading program trustees and experts on the federal budget to call on lawmakers to take action -- something many are unwilling to do out of fear of repercussions at the ballot box. Finding ways to pay for the programs in the long-term is important because together they accounted for 41 percent of federal program expenditures in fiscal year 2015. During his first U.S. Senate campaign in 2010, Rubio called for reforming entitlement programs. Specifically, Rubio said in 2010 that he was open to raising the retirement age. ""Privatization of the accounts has come and gone, (but) there are other alternatives, such as (raising) the retirement age, how you adjust payments in the future, 'need' measures, et cetera."" The retirement age came up again during a Fox News Sunday debate. Host Chris Wallace asked Rubio if he would raise the retirement age. ""I think that has to be on the table. That's got to be part of the solution. The retirement age that gradually increases for people of my generation, I think has got to be part of ...,"" Rubio said before getting cut off. Rubio was asked if he would support changing cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security beneficiaries. ""I think all of that has to be on the table, including the way we index increases in cost of living. All of these issues have to be on the table,"" Rubio said. ""They have to be options that I would be open to."" Rubio consistently said that while he wouldn’t make changes for those 55 and older, younger people such as himself (he was 39 at the time) would have to accept changes. After Rubio was elected The Senate Majority PAC’s ad cites Rubio’s comments from 2011. In March 2011, Rubio voted for a House-passed measure to cut about $61 billion from the budget through the end of the year. ""While reducing discretionary spending is an important goal, Washington is devoting a disproportionate amount of time to a tiny slice of the budget while ignoring the fact that continued inaction on saving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is bankrupting our country,"" Rubio said in a press release. In 2014, Rubio gave a speech at the National Press Club in which he again said inaction would lead to bankruptcy. Rubio called to ""gradually increase the retirement age for future retirees to account for the rise in life expectancy."" As for Medicare, he called for a ""premium support system"" that would give seniors a fixed amount of money to purchase insurance from Medicare or a private provider. That was similar to a plan by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Rubio voted for the Ryan budgets that included reductions in future Medicare spending. The burden would have fallen on beneficiaries to pay more out of pocket. While running for president in 2016, Rubio again called for reducing the debt by making changes to Social Security and Medicare. At a March debate in Miami, Rubio reiterated his stance about raising the retirement age but not for those who are 55 or older. ""Social Security will go bankrupt, and it will bankrupt the country with it,"" he said. ""So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents."" Rubio’s 2016 race While running for re-election, Rubio reiterated the same proposals for Social Security.   ""Marco's own mother relies on Social Security as her sole source of income,"" Rubio spokesman Michael Ahrens said. ""Marco would never do anything to hurt his mother or the millions of Florida seniors who depend on Social Security and Medicare, and he'll continue to fight to strengthen the programs for future generations."" His campaign staff also point to previous PolitiFact analysis that said that reining in the spending growth of a program like Medicare wasn’t the same as cutting it. Our ruling TV ads say that Marco Rubio ""wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare because he said they’re bankrupting our country."" Rubio has repeatedly said since 2010 that those programs will bankrupt the United States. His plan to raise the retirement age would amount to a cut for those recipients. He supported the Ryan budgets that included reductions in future Medicare spending. The ad omits that his proposals to change Social Security would not affect current retirees or people nearing retirement.

Philly newspaper's mistake leads to false Pat Toomey claim
","Senate candidate Pat Toomey has agreed to four debates, but the locations are an issue to his campaign. Earlier this week, it called out opponent Katie McGinty for the lack of debates in Central Pennsylvania and suggested she is avoiding the area out of fear. The insinuation, the Toomey press release explained, had to do with a comment she made to theJewish Exponent: ""McGinty previously told a local community newspaper in her native Philadelphia that she ‘has found an alarming undercurrent of misinformed people in the ‘T’ part of the state’ outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh."" Not exactly what you want to say for a part of the state that includes a few million people. But did McGinty really say that to the Jewish Exponent? We need to go back a few months to tackle this fact check. On March 30, an article about McGinty’s candidacy ran in the Exponent, headlined ""McGinty holds a strong ‘Jewish’ identity."" The article mostly featured McGinty’s beliefs about America’s relationship with Israel and some memories of her growing up in Northeast Philly. Per the conservative-leaning Washington Free Beacon, the article first contained a paraphrase of her thoughts on Central Pennsylvania voters in a quote about the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel: ""It’s really so dangerous, so misdirected,"" said McGinty, who has found an alarming undercurrent of misinformed people in the T part of the state outside the Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg Jewish strongholds. ""I am 100 percent opposed and shocked. It could not be more ill-conceived."" But on April 4 the article was corrected. Again according to the Free Beacon, the segment of the article was changed to read, ""It’s really so dangerous, so misdirected,"" said McGinty, who has found people in the ""T"" part of the state outside the Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg Jewish strongholds are unaware of BDS’ dangers. ""I am 100 percent opposed and shocked. It could not be more ill-conceived."" It was later corrected the same day to include only the quote and no paraphrase about people in Central Pennsylvania. Joshua Runyan, editor-in-chief of the Exponent, said the McGinty campaign contacted the paper and claimed McGinty never said anything similar to what she was paraphrased as saying in the article. He said he listened the recording of the interview and concluded nothing in the conversation could justify what was paraphrased in the article and his reporter, Jon Marks, had made a mistake.    ""Quite frankly,"" Runyan said, ""I’m surprised that it’s still an issue because she did not say it."" The correction wasn’t made until after Republican Congressman Joe Pitts wrote McGinty a letter on April 4 condemning the comment. McGinty’s campaign said it approached the Exponent once it became aware of the comment. The timing rankled Toomey’s campaign, which pointed out McGinty shared the article on Twitter on April 1, days before the correction was made.    ""The easiest way to solve this problem is for McGinty to release the audio from her interview,"" said Ted Kwong, a spokesperson for Toomey’s campaign. ""She has refused."" McGinty’s campaign said it does not have a recording of the interview. But after this article was first published Free Beacon reporter Brent Scher shared an email exchange with a McGinty campaign aide saying she recorded the interview and had re-listened to the conversation between McGinty and the Exponent reporter. Runyan declined to share a recording of the interview saying the Exponent has a policy of not releasing audio of interviews to other organizations. Our Ruling Pat Toomey’s campaign circulated a press release earlier this week claiming Katie McGinty told theJewish Exponent she found ""an alarming undercurrent of misinformed people in the T part of the state’ outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh."" But the newspaper corrected the article to remove the paraphrase attributed to McGinty several months ago, after the McGinty campaign complained. The paper’s editor, Joshua Runyan, said the recording revealed McGinty had made no such comment. Toomey’s campaign wants the recording released and considers the timing of the correction fishy, given McGinty tweeted the article after it was first published and the Exponent’s correction wasn’t made until after Republican politicians called out McGinty for the comment. The tape of the interview, unfortunately, was not made available by the Exponent, and the McGinty campaign said it doesn’t have a recording. Because of the correction from the Exponent and the editor’s claim McGinty said nothing to justify the original comment, there is no proof McGinty said anything about finding an alarming amount of misinformed people in Central Pennsylvania.

Hillary Clinton says Wisconsin will gain jobs under her, lose jobs under Donald Trump
","With certainty and precise counts, the Democratic presidential nominee vowed she will create jobs in Wisconsin and that the Republican nominee will kill them. ""The numbers say it all,"" read an Aug. 22, 2016 tweet from @HillaryforWI, one of the official Hillary Clinton campaign accounts. The tweet included a graphic that said Clinton ""would bring 186,740 new jobs to Wisconsin"" and ""Donald Trump would cost Wisconsin 61,050 jobs."" The claim is derived from national estimates made by a well-regarded economist. But they are estimates, based on only somewhat-detailed policy statements from the candidates. And another set of estimates, albeit done with an arguably less rigorous methodology, produced very different results. Clinton’s evidence The claim is extrapolated from a July 2016 analysis of Clinton’s economic proposals and a June 2016 analysis of Trump’s proposals by Moody’s Analytics. The lead author on both was Mark Zandi, the economic research firm’s chief economist. Zandi is a well-respected economist, one PolitiFact has quoted as an expert in previous fact checks. Interestingly, both Clinton and Trump claim Zandi is on the other team. Perhaps that’s because politicians and economists on both sides of the aisle like Zandi, and because he has contributed to Democrats (including Clinton) and Republicans. Zandi has said he is a registered Democrat, but he told us the only time he officially worked for a candidate was when he was an economic adviser to U.S. Sen. John McCain during the Arizona Republican’s 2008 presidential campaign. Zandi’s two analyses project how Clinton’s and Trump’s policies would affect jobs nationwide during a first term: A gain of 10.4 million jobs under Clinton, a loss of nearly 3.5 million jobs under Trump. The estimates gained headlines from the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and CNN/Money. Critics said, among other things, that Zandi underestimates the value of tax cuts. But, back to the claim about Wisconsin jobs.   Clinton’s campaign told us it arrived at the Wisconsin figures cited in the tweet by distributing Zandi’s estimated total gains and losses among states in proportion to their population. One can’t assume that Clinton’s or Trump’s policies would have such an evenly-distributed impact on each state; indeed, for years, Wisconsin’s job growth has lagged the nation’s. But Zandi and economist Alan Cole of the free market-oriented Tax Foundation, which PolitiFact also quotes often, told us the extrapolation is reasonable. Zandi added that if he did a state-by-state breakdown, he would expect the numbers for Wisconsin to be roughly what Clinton stated. To counter Clinton’s claim, Trump’s campaign pointed us to the Tax Foundation’s January 2016 analysis of Clinton’s tax plans, which projects that nationally there would be 311,000 fewer jobs over 10 years than would be expected under current law. Meanwhile, the foundation in a September 2015 analysis of Trump’s tax plans projected 5.3 million more jobs over the same period. Cole agreed with Zandi that Zandi’s analyses considered more factors -- for example, spending as well as taxes -- than the Tax Foundation did. Cox also called Zandi’s analyses an honest and serious effort, but said the Tax Foundation arrived at different conclusions because it took a different approach. It’s also important to note that both candidates have announced new proposals since the various estimates were made, though Zandi said he doesn’t believe they would change his estimates significantly. Our rating Clinton says she ""would bring 186,740 new jobs to Wisconsin"" and ""Donald Trump would cost Wisconsin 61,050 jobs."" The numbers are derived from analyses of Clinton and Trump policy proposals done by a respected economist from Moody Analytics who has supported both Democrats and Republicans. But the numbers are estimates, not certainties. Moreover, estimates done by the Tax Foundation using a different methodology project job gains under Trump but job losses under Clinton.

Barksdale claim on wage gap lacks context
","The so-called gender pay gap has reared its head in Georgia’s U.S. Senate race. Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson is being challenged by Democrat Jim Barksdale and Libertarian Allen Buckley in the race, which polls indicate Isakson is leading. Barksdale hopes a strong turnout by women voters in a year in which Hillary Clinton is running to become the first woman president will boost his chances. And he makes a direct appeal to them on his campaign website. ""We cannot continue to have women paid fractions compared to their male counterparts,"" Barksdale states on the site. ""In Georgia, women earn 82 cents for every dollar earned by men, and for women of color the disparities are even more stark. The wage gap is a real economic crisis and has to be addressed by our elected leaders in Washington."" PolitiFact and PolitiFact Georgia have reviewed the gender pay gap on numerous occasions. But Barksdale’s numbers are a bit different, so we decided to take a look. Specifically we wanted to look at his 82-cents comparison with men’s earnings. We contacted the Barksdale campaign about the website claim and campaign spokeswoman Emily Oh responded with an email. ""Jim Barksdale believes that Georgian women need a pay raise and equal pay for equal work would be economically beneficial to Georgia and the country as a whole,"" she wrote. 
The gender pay gap has become something of a rallying cry in political circles. It usually goes something like this: Women earn 77 cents on the dollar  for doing the ""same work"" as a man.   But that figure, derived from U.S. Census figures, is highly problematic when politicians wrap campaign slogans around it. In his 2012 re-election run, an ad for President Barack Obama claimed ""Women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men."" PolitiFact rated that statement Mostly False. Obama retooled his words in his 2014 State of the Union address, saying women ""still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns."" That statement rated Mostly True. The difference in the president’s two statements is subtle but important. The 77-cent figure does not apply to men and women who do the same job. It was never intended to be a measure of equal pay for equal work.  Instead it refers to the average disparity between the total of what men and women earn, period. All women’s earnings compared to all men’s earnings. In reality, the gender pay gap diminishes substantially when men and women of the same age, experience and education do the same job. It still exists, but diminishes to the low single digits. But there is indeed a wage gap based on gender. It exists for many reasons besides overt discrimination, experts point out. Women tend to take more time off for unpaid child-rearing responsibilities. Men tend to work more overtime. And men often pursue jobs in the high-paying science, technology, engineering and math-related professions. A wage gap exists in every part of the United States, PolitiFact Georgia found in an earlier fact-check, ranging from a low of 66.6 cents in Wyoming to a high of 90 cents in Washington, D.C., in 2010. But if broken down by narrow groups, research shows single, childless women in their 20s in major metro areas outearned male peers, specifically in Atlanta by 21 percent and by 12 percent in Los Angeles. We contacted the Barksdale campaign about the Democrat’s claim than women in Georgia make only 82 cents for every dollar earned by a man. Those numbers are attributed to the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit advocacy group that promotes ""fairness in the workplace, reproductive health and rights, access to quality, affordable health care, and policies that help women and men meet the dual demands of work and family."" That group got its  information from  the U.S. Census Bureau’s one-year American Community Survey. And that survey shows women who work full time, year-round in Georgia are paid 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, said Vicki Shabo, the group’s vice president.  That figure is calculated based on median annual pay. But it is not an attempt to measure equal pay for equal work. ""Median annual pay for a woman who holds a full-time, year-round job in Georgia is $36,468 while median annual pay for a man in Georgia who holds a full-time, year-round job is $44,623,"" Shabo wrote in an email. Our ruling Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Jim Barksdale that women in Georgia only earn 82 cents for every dollar earned by a man. Technically, that is true for full-time workers as a very broad measure. But the statement is missing substantial context needed to fully grasp a  very complex issue. When asked for clarification, Barksdale's campaign issued a statement that veered into the equal-pay-for-equal-work argument, something the study behind the statement did not attempt to address. Barksdale’s statement is accurate but misleading. We rate it Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280967B1940>],/factchecks/2016/sep/16/jim-barksdale/barksdale-claim-wage-gap-lacks-context/

""We have a responsibility to ensure agencies focus on preventing crime -- not just fighting crime after the fact,"" Harris added in the tweet. Harris is competing with U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez to replace retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer in November’s election. All three are Democrats. We decided to check whether Harris stretched the truth in her claim about the rapid rise in America’s prison population. Our research We relied on data from the Sentencing Project. The criminal justice advocacy group is considered a credible source for incarceration figures. Its data was cited by the national PolitiFact team in a recent fact check on a similar claim. The Sentencing Project’s data show there are 2.2 million people in the nation’s federal and state prisons and local jails -- a 500 percent increase over the past 40 years. For comparison, the overall United States population has increased just 51 percent during that period. Available numbers from the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics agree with those from the Sentencing Project. Harris’ claim is slightly different in that it cites the nation’s spike in ""prison population"" rather than a combined increase in prisons and jail figures. Some might read her statement as including both prison and jail inmates, but there’s a significant difference between the two. To assess Harris’ more limited claim, we examined the rise of the prison population alone. The Sentencing Project’s data show the nation’s prison population grew from 218,466 in 1974 to 1,508,636 in 2014, which is a nearly 600 percent increase. Unlike most politicians, it appears Harris understated her legitimate point.  More background Harris’ claim and stance on prison reform is significant given California’s overcrowded prisons. At nearly 600,000 people, California has the second largest correctional population among states, behind only Texas’ nearly 700,000, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Those figures include prison and jail inmates and people on probation and parole.  Source: U.S. Justice Department Harris’ claim centers on the rise of prison inmates over the past four decades. Over the past few years, however, America has seen a decline in prisoners. The nationwide total dropped about 100,000 from 2009 to 2014, according to the Sentencing Project. Reforms in California account for much of that drop, as the state has reduced its prison population by about 50,000 following a 2009 federal court order to do so, according to a report by the Public Policy Institute of California. In November, Californians will vote on Proposition 57, a measure proposed by Gov. Jerry Brown designed to ease the state’s prison overcrowding. It would allow some offenders to be considered for parole earlier than now possible. A campaign spokesman said Harris has declined to take a position on Prop 57, or any ballot measure, because as attorney general she is charged with writing an independent summary and title for each measure. The spokesman pointed to data from the Sentencing Project and other academic reports to back up Harris’ claim about the prison population. Our ruling U.S. Senate candidate Kamala Harris recently said ""Over the last 40 years, this country’s prison population has grown 500 percent."" Data show the nation’s combined prison and jail population has grown 500 percent over this period. But when isolating just the prison population, the data shows that group has soared by nearly 600 percent. No matter how you crunch the numbers, they show a dramatic rise in incarceration -- one that actually exceeds what Harris stated. Her statement is on the right track, but needs this clarification. We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Tammy Duckworth hits Mark Kirk for military embellishments
","In a speech Aug. 18 in Springfield, Ill., to the county leaders of the Illinois Democratic Party, U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth revived and added specificity to a charge that dogged U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk throughout his successful 2010 U.S. Senate campaign. ""This is the man who knows so much about national security. He’s been wrong about every issue on national security he’s ever been involved in,"" Duckworth said. ""And who, by the way, claims all this based on his military record which he lied about at least 10 times."" Those who followed Kirk’s campaign against then-Illinois State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias likely recall that Kirk in 2010 issued clarifications and apologies related to his military claims on more than one occasion. But ""at least 10?"" The Duckworth campaign provided a list of Kirk’s alleged infractions. It says Kirk falsely claimed he: won the Naval Intelligence Officer of the Year Award, performed combat duty in Kosovo, was shot at in Afghanistan and while flying over Iraq, was ""deployed"" to Afghanistan, took part in Operation Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom, was the only member of Congress as of 2005 who was a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, commanded the Pentagon’s war room and did not violate military policy about campaigning while on duty. We decided to look into the allegations. The background Kirk served as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve from 1989 to 2013 and frequently mentioned his military experience during the years he spent as U.S. representative for Illinois’ 10th Congressional District from 2001-11. There’s nothing unusual about that. As Chicago Sun-Times columnist Carol Marin noted in a June 2, 2010, column, ""In American politics, military service is like a platinum credit card."" Kirk might have kept his platinum card status had Terry Welch, an Afghanistan veteran and blogger at Nitpicker.com, not looked into a claim in 2005 by U.S. Rep. Jean Schmidt, R-Ohio, that Kirk was the first Iraq War veteran elected to Congress. (Kirk became part of this narrative only as a side player. Schmidt brought up Kirk’s service record to refute a claim by her opponent that, if elected, he would be the first Iraq War vet in Congress.) Kirk’s official House website at the time said Kirk ""is the only member of Congress to serve in Operation Iraqi Freedom…"" In a series of posts in 2005 (here, here and here), Welch painstakingly dissected Kirk’s claim of Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran status. Kirk’s office eventually changed the wording, though Welch noted that it took 50 days for it to do so. ""While we applaud the service of Mark Kirk, his service occurred before the March 19, 2003, start date of the mission, according to the Bush administration itself,"" Welch wrote in this post. The episode, though clumsily handled by Kirk’s office, faded in the years that followed. But when Kirk in 2010 became the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate seat previously held by Barack Obama, it became a crack in a dam that soon would unleash a flood of reporting on similar incidents in which Kirk inaccurately described his military career. The questions started anew in May 2010, when Kirk’s opponent, then-Illinois Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, challenged Kirk’s claim to have been named Naval Reserve Intelligence Officer of the Year in 1999. This led to an admission by Kirk that he had not won the award, but was part of a unit that won a different honor. ""Commander Danny Hernandez, a Navy spokesman, said Thursday the individual 1999 Naval Reserve Intelligence Officer of the Year was given to another reservist and not to Kirk,"" the Chicago Tribune reported. Also around that time, Kirk changed his website to remove the word ""combat"" from his description of military service in Kosovo. On June 3, Kirk faced new allegations of embellishment when he visited the Chicago Tribune editorial board. From the Tribune’s report: In a new disclosure, Kirk acknowledged that his campaign's promotion of him coming under fire while flying aboard an intelligence reconnaissance plane in Iraq may not be correct because there is no record of whether his aircraft was being fired upon. Kirk also acknowledged a constituent letter sent out by his North Shore congressional district office last year that described him as a member of Operation Desert Storm, though he did not participate in that effort. ""I am sorry, absolutely,"" Kirk said. ""You should speak with utter precision. You should stand on the documented military record. In public discourse, for high office, you should make sure that there is a degree of complete rigorous precession."" If you’re keeping score, that’s six of the 10. On June 13, the Tribune ran a story challenging Kirk’s claim that he had been ""deployed"" to Afghanistan when really he had been there for short training stints. The article again quoted Navy spokesman Commander Danny Hernandez. ""A deployment is a deployment and annual training is annual training,"" Hernandez said. That’s No. 7. On July 8, 2010, PolitiFact summarized more inaccuracies in Kirk’s telling of his military background. These found Kirk claiming, incorrectly, that he had served in Operation Desert Storm and that he ""command(ed) the war room in the Pentagon."" PolitiFact mentioned those and other incidents while testing the veracity of a claim by Kirk’s opponent that Kirk had been disciplined for ""violat(ing) Pentagon rules...for improperly mingling politics with his military service."" PolitiFact ruled the statement True, which brought more trouble for Kirk when his office persisted in claiming that he never had violated those rules. That’s 8 and 9. But Duckworth specified 10, and among those was a claim that Kirk lied about being shot at in Afghanistan. This is based on a Huffington Post article published June 4, 2010, that claimed Kirk had given conflicting accounts of whether or not he was shot at in Kandahar. In January 2009, Kirk had told the suburban Lake County News Sun that he ""never got shot at"" during recent service in Afghanistan. In January 2010, Kirk was asked on a Chicago Sun-Times questionnaire about the ""wildest thing"" he had ever done in his career. He responded, ""Last year, I was with a Dutch armor unit in Kandahar, getting shot at."" The original HuffPo article inferred that Kirk gave conflicting reports about the same incident. But Kirk’s campaign spokesman said in an addendum to the article that that was not correct: Eric Elk, a spokesman for Kirk, said that there is no contradiction in the statements. The Congressman, he says, was referring to two different instances in which he was in Kandahar. ""He there was there in December 2008/Jan 2009 and then December 2009/Jan 2010,"" said Elk. That would be the last of the new accusations pertaining to Kirk’s military career. Kirk weathered the storm and made numerous statements of contrition, then went on to defeat Giannoulias in a narrow victory in November. Our ruling Duckworth said Kirk claims military and defense expertise ""based on his military record which he lied about at least 10 times."" There is no disputing that Kirk spent the summer of 2010 explaining and apologizing for misstatements in describing his military experience. The Duckworth campaign listed these 10 examples when we asked: Naval Intelligence Officer of the Year Award Taking fire while flying over Iraq Serving combat duty in Kosovo Being shot at in Afghanistan Being ""deployed"" to Afghanistan Taking part in Operation Desert Storm Participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom Claimed to be the only member of Congress who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom Claimed to command the Pentagon’s war room Claimed he had not violated Pentagon policy about campaigning while on duty The fourth claim on this list, that Kirk lied about being shot at in Afghanistan, is in dispute. The original source for that claim contains an update indicating Kirk described two separate incidents. Kirk’s current campaign spokesman, Kevin Artl, reiterated that explanation when contacted for this article. The groundwork on the other nine claims was done six years ago or longer, sometimes by multiple media outlets. If you follow the links included above, you’ll see that the coverage at times creates a confusing patchwork of sourcing that makes it difficult to put all this into a smooth timeline. You’ll also see a long pattern -- albeit one that appears to have ended after the summer of 2010 -- of ambiguous language and conflicting claims throughout Mark Kirk’s frequent pronouncements on his military activity. We rate Duckworth’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1B3140>],/factchecks/2016/sep/15/tammy-duckworth/tammy-duckworth-hits-mark-kirk-military-embellishm/

John Fleming attacks IRS in inaccurate radio ad
","In a recent radio campaign ad, Louisiana senate candidate John Fleming claimed that the head of the Internal Revenue Service ordered 24,000 emails erased before Congress could see them. ""The head of the IRS ordered 24,000 emails erased before Congress could review them, making sure the American people will never know the real truth,"" Fleming’s ad says. ""The officials in charge follow the same dishonest playbook they’ve used for every scandal from Fast and Furious to Hillary’s emails."" Fleming is running for senator of Louisiana against six Republican candidates, including David Duke, as well as three Democrats and one unaffiliated candidate. Fleming -- who currently represents Louisiana in the House -- is calling for the impeachment of IRS commissioner John Koskinen. So far, Democrats are largely against the impeachment, and Republicans are divided on it, citing due process concerns. A vote on the matter was expected on Sept. 15, 2016, but it was delayed. Since destruction of documents is a serious charge, we wondered if it was true that the head of the IRS ""ordered 24,000 emails erased before Congress could review them."" Independent reports suggest that’s not the case. Congress first requested emails in May 2013 as part of an investigation into unfair targeting of the Tea Party and other right-leaning groups for tax exemptions. Lois Lerner – the former Exempt Organizations Unit director – had admitted to using loaded keywords, including ""tea party,"" to search within tax exemption forms. However, it was not proven the IRS targeted groups based on political ideology. Investigators then noticed a gap in email dates. They discovered Lerner’s hard drive crashed in 2011, erasing Congress-requested emails. This prompted another investigation into whether the IRS purposefully destroyed the them. According to investigation reports from the Justice Department and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, no evidence was found that the IRS intentionally obstructed justice. Both investigations reached the same conclusion after interviewing 118 witnesses, reviewing 20 terabytes of data (equal to about 1.3 million printed pages) and collecting documentation from more than 80 IRS employees. One method investigators used to try to recover documents was to examine IRS email backup tapes. They discovered IRS employees had inadvertently destroyed 400 tapes that may have contained the missing emails. In May 2013, then-IRS Chief Technology Officer, Terence Milholland, sent an email in changing the backup tape recycle policy from six months to an indefinite retention period. ""Given the current environment and ongoing investigations, until further notice, do not destroy/wipe/reuse any of the existing backup tapes for email, or archiving of other information from IRS personal computers,"" the email said. Milholland also instructed employees to save all information on personal computers being returned, reclaimed, refreshed, or updated. However, there was a misunderstanding among employees, resulting in the destruction of the tapes. Treasury Department interviews and emails between employees show some thought the CTO policy only prevented the destruction of hard drives, the report investigation said. We reached out to the Fleming campaign, and they sent us a transcript of a hearing before the Committee on Government Oversight and Reform on the IRS emails. According to testimony from Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George during the hearing, ""As Ms. Lerner’s hard drive could not be recovered, and the 422 tapes most likely to have contained Ms. Lerner’s e-mails from 2010 and 2011 were erased in March 2014, we were unable to recover all of the missing e-mails."" However, the Treasury Inspector General investigation stated, ""No evidence was uncovered that any IRS employees had been directed to destroy or hide information from Congress, the DOJ or TIGTA."" Our ruling Fleming said, ""The head of the IRS ordered 24,000 emails erased before Congress could review them, making sure the American people will never know the real truth."" Emails were erased, and up to 24,000 are likely unrecoverable. However, there’s zero evidence that the head of the IRS ordered them destroyed. Multiple independent investigations confirmed that the erasure was accidental and not intended to obstruct information from Congress. Fleming’s ad says the opposite. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B06880>],/factchecks/2016/sep/15/john-fleming/john-fleming-attacks-irs-inaccurate-radio-ad/
