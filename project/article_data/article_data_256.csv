In Russia investigation, Senate hearings have uncommon transparency says Sen. Richard Burr
","As the investigation into ties between Russia and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign continues, has one side-effect been increased transparency on Capitol Hill? That’s what North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr said Tuesday as he kicked off the latest hearing in the Russia saga, this time with Attorney General Jeff Sessions under oath. The week before that, it was former FBI director James Comey.  Both testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Burr, the committee’s chairman, said he wants the American people to hear what key officials have to say, ""so that they may make their own judgments"" on the investigation. ""It is for that reason that this is the committee’s 10th open hearing of 2017 — more than double that held by the committee in any recent year — and the fifth on the topic of Russian interference,"" Burr said Tuesday. We wondered if Burr was right about how transparent his committee has been while conducting this investigation. Just six months into Trump’s presidency, has the committee investigating Russia ties already been so much more publicly active than in previous years? What the committee does The Senate Intelligence Committee, as the name implies, is tasked with overseeing the nation’s intelligence agencies. It gets briefed on classified missions and threats, helps write secret portions of the federal budget, vets the president’s nominees for high-level intelligence jobs and conducts investigations into intelligence-related matters.  For nearly a year now, Russian attempts to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election (including in Burr’s home state of North Carolina) have been a major national news story. And Burr is correct that his committee has held 10 open hearings already in 2017, including five related to the Trump/Russia investigation.  In fact, Russian election meddling was the very first thing the committee tackled in public this year, on Jan. 10 — before Trump was even sworn in as president. Comparison with recent history So Burr is right on one part of his claim. But is he also right that that amount of hearings substantially outpaces the committee’s recent history? Senate records show that the Senate Intelligence Committee met in public five or fewer times in nearly every year of the Obama administration. That backs up Burr’s claim. Burr took over control of the committee in 2015. Already in the first six months of 2017, he has held more public hearings than in his first two years as chairman combined. This year’s public schedule has also been at least twice as busy as most of the years under his predecessor from 2009-14, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Also noteworthy is that the Senate Intelligence Committee doesn’t have sole responsibility for intelligence investigations. There’s a similar committee in the House of Representatives. And again, Burr’s committee has been more transparent. The House Intelligence Committee has held four hearings this year. Two were closed, one was open and one was mixed. To be clear, Burr’s not particularly happy about the committee’s transparency. ""I have said repeatedly that I do not believe anything the committee does should be done in public,"" Burr said just before he made the claim we’re checking now. Comparison with past investigations Finally, we compared its current Russia investigation with a few others the Senate Intelligence Committee has tackled. Two major investigations the committee wrapped up in 2004 and 2014 were conducted with zero public hearings, although they both ended with a partial report being made public.  Those focused on intelligence failures leading up to the Iraq War and the CIA torture program, respectively. (On the torture report, Burr has fought fiercely to seize every copy of the full, still-classified 6,700-page report to keep it from being leaked or made public through a lawsuit.) This year’s action has clearly been more transparent than those. However, it pales in comparison to the 1987 investigation into the Iran-Contra Affair under President Ronald Reagan.  That year, investigative committees in both the House and Senate interviewed 500 people over the course of 40 days of public hearings, according to a book by L. Britt Snider, who was the Senate Intelligence Committee’s top lawyer during that investigation and later became the CIA’s inspector general. Our ruling Burr bragged about the transparency of his Senate committee’s ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. He said Sessions’ testimony was the 10th public hearing his committee has had already in 2017, ""more than double that held by the committee in any recent year."" Burr is right, and the committee has also been holding more public hearings now than its House counterpart, as well as more than it did during past investigations into topics like CIA torture, intelligence failures leading up to the Iraq War and intelligence failures before 9/11.  We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2017/jun/14/richard-burr/russia-investigation-senate-hearings-have-uncommon/
"['Georgia', 'Homeland Security', 'Nuclear', 'Karen Handel']","
Is Iran complying with the nuclear deal? For the most part, yes
","Republican Karen Handel took aim at the Iran nuclear deal in two recent televised debates ahead of Georgia’s special election, accusing Iran of failing to comply with the agreement to scale back its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling economic sanctions. ""From the things that I have seen, they are and (have) already violated the terms of the deal,"" Handel said in a June 8 debate against Democrat Jon Ossoff ahead of the June 20 vote. In the campaign for Georgia’s 6th, a historically Republican congressional district, Handel has been sharply critical of the agreement, which President Donald Trump disparaged as the ""worst deal ever negotiated"" during his 2016 run. GOP attack ads launched in May sought to paint Ossoff as a dangerous national security naif in part by highlighting his support for the Obama-era deal. The agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, was signed in 2015 by the United States and Iran, as well as China, Russia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Under the deal, Iran has agreed not to pursue nuclear weapons and to allow continuous monitoring of its compliance. The United States and other countries agreed to lift sanctions on the condition that Iran abide by its end of the bargain, lest sanctions be reimposed. The deal’s finer details get very technical very quickly, with dozens of limitations placed on Iran’s nuclear-related activities. But the major points concern Iran giving up materials it could use to quickly build a nuclear weapon. Iran agreed to relinquish nearly all of its enriched uranium stockpile (97 percent) and 70 percent of its centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium. It also agreed to stop plutonium production and to dismantle its plutonium reactor. Because Iranian compliance is a crucial national security issue, we decided to look closer at Handel’s repeated claims that the Islamic Republic had violated the terms of the deal. The prevailing view among foremost authorities is that Iran has complied with the deal. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, has primary monitoring responsibility, and its quarterly reports are considered the authoritative view of Iran’s compliance. With a couple of minor exceptions we’ll deal with later, the agency has repeatedly found Iran to be in compliance with the terms of the agreement. The U.S. State Department, which is required to report to Congress every 90 days on Iran’s compliance, also certified in April that the Islamic Republic is living up to its end of the deal. Additionally, experts we interviewed agreed Iran is complying with nuclear pact. So case closed, right? Mostly, but with some minor qualifications. While the IAEA has certified Iran’s compliance in its quarterly reports, Iran’s record is not without blemishes. The Handel campaign zeroed in on those. Handel’s campaign aide pointed us to news reports and congressional testimony that highlighted instances where Iran committed two small infractions of a highly technical nature. The deal says Iran can keep 130 metric tons of ""heavy water,"" a modified liquid used in some nuclear reactors. However, Iran has twice crept over its limit, according to the IAEA, each time by a fraction of one ton. These breaches formed the core basis of Handel’s claim that Iran violated the nuclear deal. Some experts we spoke to said Iran has tried to create wiggle room by interpreting portions of the agreement to favor their own interests. But the clear consensus is that it overstates the case to say Iran has violated the deal. Daryl Kimball, the executive director Arms Control Association, downplayed the heavy water issue as a ""minor infraction,"" and noted that Iran currently does not have a functioning heavy water reactor. In other words, from a practical standpoint, the issue is essentially moot because excessive heavy water wouldn’t move Iran closer to building a nuclear weapon. Several experts also noted Iran quickly rectified its breach to come back into compliance. Handel’s campaign pointed us to congressional testimony by David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, who warned lawmakers in February about Iran exceeding its heavy water cap. But Handel’s own source now appears to have a more sanguine view on the state of Iran’s compliance. ""Iran appears to be complying more strictly with JCPOA limitations over which it was facing controversy, such as the heavy water cap,"" Albright wrote in a June 5 analysis of the IAEA’s latest Iran report. It is also worth noting that Albright told lawmakers on April 5 that he did not believe Iran’s excessive supply of heavy water justified reimposing sanctions. Several experts said that under any technical agreement there are bound to be minor implementation issues. ""A complex, technical process like this one is inevitably going to face small hiccups,"" said Ariane M. Tabatabai, visiting assistant professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. ""Just as Iran believes there have been hiccups on the U.S. side."" She added it’s important to distinguish brief slip-ups ― like Iran’s temporary, slightly excessive heavy water inventory ― from major violations. ""What’s critical to watch is whether the parties settle those issues in a timely manner and whether they remain fairly minor,"" Tabatabai said. ""So far, the IAEA, State (Department) and the (European Union) believe this was the case."" Richard Nephew, senior research scholar on global energy policy at Columbia University, added that allegations of cheating are best reserved for clear-cut, consequential breaches, should they arise. ""I don't agree with Ms. Handel's assertion,"" he said, ""and think that it is overstated."" Handel said Iran has ""violated the terms of the (nuclear) deal."" The IAEA, the foremost authority on the matter, has repeatedly deemed Iran in compliance with the nuclear deal. The State Department has also certified the Islamic Republic is holding up its end of the bargain, and a host of experts affirmed these definitive findings. However, the IAEA did report two instances where Iran barely -- and briefly -- exceeded its supply of a nuclear reactor component known as ""heavy water.""   But experts said this minor breach posed no practical risk of moving Iran closer to developing a nuclear weapon, and added that such infractions should not be interpreted to mean Iran has not complied with terms of the deal. We rate Handel’s statement Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2017/jun/14/karen-handel/iran-complying-nuclear-deal-yes-small-hiccups/

Jeff Sessions cites 'longstanding policy' to deflect senators' questions in Russia hearing
","Democratic senators skewered Attorney General Jeff Sessions for refusing to answer their questions about his private conversations with President Donald Trump during a June 13 hearing about Sessions’ role in the controversy over Russia and the election. Sessions said Trump hadn’t invoked executive privilege, which presidents can use to prevent the compelled disclosure of private executive branch communications and deliberations. Instead, Sessions cited ""longstanding"" Justice Department policy as his reason for declining to comment. ""It's a longstanding policy of the Department of Justice not to comment on conversations that the attorney general has had with the president of the United States, for confidential reasons that, really, are founded in the coequal branch powers in the Constitution of the United States,"" Sessions said. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., asked Sessions if this policy is in writing somewhere. ""I think so,"" he replied. So we asked the Justice Department where this policy was written down. Spokesman Ian Prior sent us two memos about executive privilege written in 1982, as well as a 2009 memo based on the rationale laid out in the 1982 documents.       Based on Sessions’ testimony, we were looking for the memos to say that an attorney general should not comment on conversations he or she has had with a president or top White House officials, full stop. But that’s not exactly what the memos say. They acknowledge that the executive branch has an expectation that its communications remain confidential, so they guide the attorney general to consult with the White House counsel about congressional information requests involving White House communications. Then, the president can decide whether to invoke executive privilege to keep those communications confidential if necessary. In his testimony, Sessions said he didn’t want to answer certain questions without first giving Trump the opportunity to decide whether it would be appropriate to share that information with Congress or keep it confidential. ""It would be premature for me to deny the president a full and intelligent choice about executive privilege,"" Sessions said. ""It is improper for agents of any of the department (or) any departments in the executive branch to waive that privilege without a clear approval of the president,"" he added later. This rationale — that Sessions needs to talk with the president first before commenting — seems to be in line with the 1982 and 2009 memos. ""Congressional requests for information shall be complied with as promptly and fully as possible, unless it is determined that compliance raises a substantial question of executive privilege,"" says one of the 1982 memos, which President Ronald Reagan issued to the heads of executive branch departments and agencies. However, it’s important to consider that many of the questions Sessions declined to answer were ones that he could have predicted, given the topic of the hearing, noted Duke University law professor Lisa Kern Griffin, an expert in dishonesty and the law. Sessions deflected questions about details of his conversations with Trump about the Russia investigation or the firing of FBI director James Comey. So Sessions could have asked Trump in advance of the hearing whether an executive privilege invocation would be appropriate. ""Basically (Sessions) is trying to gain the benefits of claiming executive privilege without its political or legal consequences,"" said Heidi Kitrosser, an expert in government transparency and professor at the University of Minnesota. To fully abide with the policies outlined in the Justice Department memos, Sessions should have made it clear that he planned to consult with Trump about the questions Congress asked him, Kitrosser added. If Sessions continues to refuse to answer Congress’ questions, and Trump doesn’t invoke executive privilege, Congress could ultimately hold him in contempt or impeach him, said Jamal Greene, a constitutional law professor at Columbia University. ""That remedy is, however, highly unlikely,"" he said. Interestingly, in his former life as a senator, Sessions asked Attorney General Eric Holder about his private conversations with President Barack Obama during a congressional hearing in January 2014. (Bloomberg View Executive Editor Tim O’Brien uncovered this example.) ""Did he consult with you before he made that statement?"" Sessions asked, during a January 2014 hearing, regarding a comment President Barack Obama made to the New Yorker about marijuana. ""No, we didn't talk about that,"" Holder replied. This exchange between Holder and Sessions doesn’t automatically refute Sessions’ reasoning, however. We don’t know if Obama cleared Holder to talk about their conversations about marijuana legalization, or if Holder didn’t think his statement raised a substantial question of executive privilege. In 2012, Congress held Holder in contempt for refusing to provide records related to the Fast and Furious scandal. The Obama White House had invoked executive privilege in that case, though a federal judge rejected that decision in 2016. Sessions said, ""It's a longstanding policy of the Department of Justice not to comment on conversations that the attorney general has had with the president of the United States."" The Justice Department provided us with memos from 1982 and 2009 about executive privilege. They do not say outright that attorneys general can’t ever comment on conversations with the president. However, they do guide the attorney general to consult with the White House before responding to congressional inquiries that may involve confidential communications with the president. This is the rationale Sessions invoked later in his testimony. Sessions’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2017/jun/14/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-cites-longstanding-policy-deflect-se/

Rafael Anchia: Six times since 2011, federal rulings found intentional discrimination by Legislature
","After federal judges in April 2017 ruled that Texas Republicans had intentionally diluted minority voting strength when they redrew U.S. and Texas House districts, a Democratic legislator said it wasn't the first time — or even the fifth. Rep. Rafael Anchia of Dallas, who chairs the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, posted a tweet saying: ""How many federal rulings have NOW found intentional discrimination by #Txlege since 2011? 6."" Six rulings? We wondered. Specific rulings When we inquired, Jaclyn Uresti, executive director of MALC, emailed us a list that added up to six decisions, all of which we confirmed from news accounts and court rulings: August 28, 2012: In a case brought by the U.S. Justice Department three federal judges ruled that the Republican-led state had ""not met its burden to show that the U.S. Congressional and State House Plans will not have a retrogressive effect, and that the U.S. Congressional and State Senate Plans were not enacted with discriminatory purpose."" In rejecting the argument from state attorneys, the court said the maps had ""the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group"" in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The opinion came from U.S. District Judges Rosemary Collyer and Beryl Howell, and Circuit Judge Thomas Griffith. August 30, 2012: In a unanimous ruling, three judges in Washington, D.C., issued the first of what were to become several decisions that blocked the state’s photo ID law, which requires Texans to present a state-issued photo ID before casting a ballot at the polls, though as of August 2016 in accord with a federal court ruling a voter could vote after providing another form of ID, such as a utility bill, after signing an affidavit explaining why they were unable to obtain one of the IDs allowed under the law. ""A law that forces poorer citizens to choose between their wages and their franchise unquestionably denies or abridges their right to vote,"" the opinion said, adding that the law was intentionally discriminatory. ""Simply put, many Hispanics and African Americans who voted in the last election will, because of the burdens imposed by (the law), likely be unable to vote in the next election."" The panel included Judges David S. Tatel, Rosemary Mayers Collyer and Robert Leon Wilkins, who serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. (In January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up a request from Texas officials to reinstate the voter ID law, but the court said it might consider the case at a later date.) October 9, 2014: In a case brought by U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Fort Worth, U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Corpus Christi ruled the voter ID law violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by disproportionately and intentionally burdening African American and Latino voters. She blocked the law from going into effect and said it amounted to an unconstitutional poll tax. March 10, 2017: A three-judge panel ruled, in a case brought by Shannon Perez, a Latina Democratic Bexar County voter represented by pro-Democratic attorneys Rick Gray and David Richards of Austin, that Republican lawmakers in 2011 drew three of the state’s 36 congressional districts in a way that discriminated against Latino voters. Districts 23 and 27, both represented by Republicans, and District 35, were held by a Democrat. The court found fault in the district lines in their current forms, but did not order legislators to redraw them. This ruling brought a 2-1 split on the court. U.S. District Judges Orlando Garcia and Xavier Rodriguez ruled in favor, District Judge David Smith dissented. April 10, 2017: Judge Ramos of Corpus Christi -- reviewing Veasey’s voter ID case at the direction of U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5h Circuit --  found that the 2011 Legislature intentionally discriminated against minority voters by advancing the mandate that each voter present a photo ID if casting a ballot at the polls. Most recently, the 2017 Legislature revised the voter ID law, in an attempt to alleviate Ramos’s concerns that the list of acceptable IDs was too strict, but Democrats argued the reforms were not nearly far-reaching enough. Ramos was expected to issue an updated ruling, taking into account the adopted changes, later in 2017. April 20, 2017: The pair of federal judges who ruled against Texas in March 2017 decided, in a new case brought by Democrats, that Republican lawmakers in 2011 redrew Texas House districts with the intention of diluting the electoral strength of minority voters in several parts of the state. ""The impact of the plan was certainly to reduce minority voting opportunity statewide, resulting in even less proportional representation for minority voters,"" according to the court’s 2-1 opinion, with Smith dissenting. ""Discussions among map drawers demonstrated a hostility to creating any new minority districts, as those were seen to be a loss of Republican seats, despite the massive minority population growth statewide."" The cited rulings looked to us like six instances of federal judges all finding intentional discrimination by the 2011 Legislature. Potential fallout That finding, if it sticks, could have significant consequences (though it’s also worth keeping in mind that after the 2020 U.S. census, the 2021 Legislature will be expected to redraw districts afresh based on changes in the state’s population since 2010). To our inquiry, Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and former civil rights attorney in the Department of Justice under President Obama, said as little as a single judicial finding of intentional discrimination by Texas lawmakers could fuel a court to reimpose a previous decades-long requirement that any changes in state election law be submitted to the Justice Department or a federal court before taking effect. That ""preclearance"" hurdle went away for Texas and other jurisdictions, mostly southern states, when the Supreme Court in 2012 found unconstitutional a provision in the Voting Rights Act specifying when a state or local government must face preclearance. Levitt said of Anchia’s claim: ""If you include intentional discrimination, there’s no question the number is six. Six is a giant number when it comes to this. A court only needs one example to suffice, so five or six is a lot."" Our ruling Anchia said that six times since 2011, federal rulings found intentional discrimination by the Texas Legislature. We confirmed six such rulings from August 2012 through April 2017 issued by federal judges regarding Republican-drawn U.S. House and Texas House districts or the GOP-driven law requiring voters to present photo identification at the polls. We rate the claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

Democratic candidate for governor Andrew Gillum overcounts campaign donors
","Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum says he outperformed his rivals for Florida governor in a key fundraising metric despite having less name recognition and taking time off from the campaign. His campaign issued the following statement to media under the headline, ""Gillum Leads Gov. Field in Donors, $1.2M Raised YTD,"" on June 9: ""Our campaign was thrilled for the mayor’s family to welcome their third child last month, and he took some well-deserved time off the campaign trail. We’re excited to have more than 7,000 contributors, the most in the race, and we’re raising the resources to compete in all 67 counties. ""The mayor doesn't have a famous last name or personal wealth, but we're proud to have the support of thousands of Floridians."" The number of contributors was repeated by a few news outlets. Gillum, the first major candidate to enter the 2018 governor’s race, wasn’t claiming to be the fundraising frontrunner in terms of dollars through May, but only in the number of donors -- often cited by campaigns as a measure of grassroots support. In terms of dollars raised, Republican Adam Putnam has raised the most overall while former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham raised the most on the Democratic side. Gillum raised about $1.1 million, excluding in-kind contributions: almost $500,000 for his campaign account and $600,000 through his Forward Florida PAC. Gillum has a point that he has more donors. But Gillum’s donor count is exaggerated. We looked at individual contributions to Gillum’s campaign and his Forward Florida PAC. At a glance, Gillum’s point nearly checks out, with a combined total of 6,933 contributions between both lists. The problem: Several people gave multiple times. By removing individuals who donated more than once, we got a smaller number. We found 5,383 unique names on individual contributions and 70 on Florida Forward PAC for a combined total of 5,453 donors. (The total includes a few donors who gave in-kind contributions as well for food and beverages.) We counted nine donors who gave money to both Gillum’s account and the PAC, including actress Jane Fonda and Allison Tant, the former Florida Democratic Party chair. Take out people and entities who gave to both the campaign and committee, and the donor count goes down to 5,444. Other donors gave multiple times in small increments -- for example Marilyn Bailey, a Sanford resident, gave 10 times in amounts ranging from $5 to $20.18. We sent those numbers to spokesman Geoff Burgan and asked how he arrived at ""more than 7,000."" ""Our campaign has 6,933 total contributions from more than 5,300 people across Florida and the country,’ Burgan told PolitiFact in an email. ""After further reviewing our in-kind contributions, we realized we slightly misstated the total in our press release."" Gillum says his campaign has received donations from ""more than 7,000 contributors."" Gillum has raised more individual donations than leading competitors. But his donor total was wrong by more than 1,500 individuals because he counted some donors more than once.

Donald Trump's boasts about accomplishments in office ring hollow
","Some commentators called it ""the weirdest Cabinet meeting ever"": President Donald Trump’s leadership team gathered to deliver a litany of praise for the president. Trump saved some of the boasting for himself, making claims that his administration has been one of historic accomplishments. ""I will say that never has there been a president -- with few exceptions; in the case of FDR, he had a major depression to handle -- who's passed more legislation, who's done more things than what we've done, between the executive orders and the job-killing regulations that have been terminated,"" Trump said, later adding, ""We've achieved tremendous success."" We’ve previously checked Trump’s claim in April that ""no administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days"" and found that assertion to be False. But given the high-profile setting of Trump’s comment -- his first formal Cabinet meeting -- we decided to take a look at his new statement. Presidential and congressional scholars aren’t any more convinced than they were in April. ""Trump’s boasts are empty,"" said Max J. Skidmore, a University of Missouri-Kansas City political scientist who has written several books on the presidency. When we checked with the White House, they noted that in this remark Trump acknowledged exceptions such as Roosevelt. They also pointed to the statistics for the number of laws and executive orders signed by a president in 100 days -- a metric that Trump fares well on. Around the 100-day point of Trump’s presidency, we found that White House press secretary Sean Spicer was accurate on the numbers when he said that the current president has ""worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since (Harry) Truman."" We noted that in the first 100 days of his first full term, Truman signed 55 bills; the president with the highest count since then is Trump with 28. However, none of the bills Trump had signed at that point qualified as major pieces of legislation. None of the ones since are, either. They include, among others, two federal spending bills of the sort required periodically of every president and Congress to keep the government running; a bill overhauling government-employee travel policy; a bill about the United States competing for an international expo; a measure addressing Department of Homeland Security vehicle fleets; and the official naming of a federal courthouse in Tennessee. While the White House is pursuing several major issues in Congress -- notably the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act and efforts to cut taxes and promote infrastructure -- it would be premature for Trump to take credit for these. The health care bill has passed the House but not yet passed the Senate, while the tax and infrastructure measures haven’t even gotten that far. Trump is ""correct that he has signed a rather large, although not unprecedented, number of bills,"" Skidmore said. However, ""most of the bills he has signed are routine and unimportant."" Sarah Binder, a George Washington University political scientist who specializes in Congress, agreed that ""the absence of significant legislative movement is glaring. Contrary to Trump's statement, this is a Republican government struggling to legislate, despite control of both chambers and the White House."" By contrast, even if you set aside Franklin D. Roosevelt -- as Trump did -- other presidents signed more far-reaching legislation during their first 100 days. Bill Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, while Barack Obama signed not only a nearly $800 billion stimulus package to combat a spiraling recession but also the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and a law expanding the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Obama also implemented two urgent economic programs formally passed in the final weeks of George W. Bush’s presidency -- the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the auto industry bailout. Meanwhile, John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps (later ratified by Congress), while Truman’s first 100 days were a whirlwind of foreign-policy actions -- the end of World War II in Europe, the writing of the United Nations charter, the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan, and Japan’s unconditional surrender. Trump’s most significant legislative achievements may be his use of the Congressional Review Act -- a previously little-used power that makes it easier for Congress and the president to overturn federal regulations. ""Some of these regulations are substantively and politically important,"" such as the overturning of the Stream Protection Act, an environmental regulation that Trump and others said harmed coal mining, said Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist. Still, Koger added, ""these definitely do not rise to the level of ‘landmark’ legislation, or even ‘major’ legislation."" And John Frendreis, a political scientist at Loyola University in Chicago, added that such powers were not available to most postwar presidents, since the Congressional Review Act was only passed in the 1990s. This makes comparisons with past presidents difficult, he said. As president, Trump has signed some three dozen executive orders, which also places him numerically above the presidents since Franklin Roosevelt. A number of these orders have addressed high-profile issues, and some could potentially have significant impacts. One -- a visa ban for individuals from certain Muslim-majority nations -- remains tied up in lawsuits and is headed to the Supreme Court. Another notable order directs the Treasury Department to stop collecting penalties related to not having health insurance. If this policy is followed and isn’t blocked by the courts, ""it could cripple this aspect of the Affordable Care Act without altering the law,"" Frendreis said. Trump also used executive orders to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and to green-light key pipelines that had been held up by the Obama administration. And Trump also announced that the United States would be pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, though he didn’t use an executive order in that case. These are significant policy changes -- but it’s important to note some caveats about Trump’s use of executive orders. First, many of these orders started the ball rolling to overturn federal regulations, rather than overturning them in one fell swoop. Often, Congress needs to weigh in to change a law, or Cabinet departments must undertake a lengthy administrative process before policies officially change. And second, new presidents routinely issue orders during their first 100 days that overturn actions of their predecessors of the opposite party. Just two days after taking office, President Bill Clinton signed orders overturning restrictions on abortion imposed during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, and with equal speed, President George W. Bush overturned Clinton’s opposition to a ban on aid to international groups that participate in abortions. ""Every president uses executive orders, especially when they cannot pass legislation because of a hostile Congress,"" Frendreis said. ""So his actions here are typical, and not unusually impressive. In fact, his need to act administratively instead of legislatively implies legislative weakness, not strength, because he should be able to make policy through the legislative process since he has unified partisan control."" All told, he said, ""the early Trump presidency stands out in terms of the number of symbolic actions he has taken to ‘fulfill’ campaign promises, but his record of changing policy is not off to a fast start. Like all presidents, he has taken some impactful actions, but he does not stand out in this regard."" In his Cabinet meeting, Trump said that rare is the president ""who's passed more legislation, who's done more things than what we've done, between the executive orders and the job-killing regulations that have been terminated."" Scholars of the presidency and Congress are unconvinced that Trump’s legislative and administrative output is exceptional by historical standards. Trump has signed a relatively large number of bills so far, but comparatively few with significant impact. And while some of his executive orders have made an immediate impact, most have merely expressed his policy preferences or set in motion a process that may, or may not, change policies down the road.

Ossoff: GOP health plan guts protections for pre-existing conditions in Georgia
","Health care dominated the final debate in the special election to fill Georgia’s 6th Congressional District seat. Republican Karen Handel argued that people with pre-existing conditions would do fine under the House Republican’s American Health Care Act. Democrat Jon Ossoff pushed back against the former secretary of state. ""It's fine to say, madam secretary, that someone cannot be denied coverage period if they have a pre-existing condition,"" Ossoff said. ""But if there's no limit on price discrimination and the plan is unaffordable, that is a useless protection. And it is a fact that this bill guts protections against massive price hikes for Georgians with pre-existing conditions."" The treatment of pre-existing conditions has emerged as one of the thorniest issues in the health care debate.  We decided to explore how the Republican bill compares with the current law, the Affordable Care Act. Both the existing Affordable Care Act and the proposed American Health Care Act require insurance companies to sell everyone a plan. If you want to buy, they must sell. That’s called guaranteed issue, but the rules under the two approaches are different. The Affordable Care Act says carriers can’t base rates on a person’s health status. That’s the default for the American Health Care Act, too, but it gives states another choice. They can get a waiver that allows companies to charge more for people with higher health care risks who have a break in their insurance coverage. The GOP’s health care bill allows states to use two different approaches that could affect people with pre-existing conditions. States could let insurance companies base rates on a person’s health status, and they could trim the list of health services that every plan must offer. The Affordable Care Act requires 10 basic services, including maternity care and mental health treatment. Those two are mentioned most often as being at risk if states decide to trim the list. The American Health Care Act sets aside $8 billion for states that get waivers to use in a number of ways. They could use a portion to help cover the costs of high-risk people. There would be additional billions for all states to write down the costs of maternity and mental health care. No one can say for sure how this would play out. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, estimated that one-sixth of Americans would live in states that chose both to trim the list of essential health services and allow insurers to charge sicker people more. In those places, the CBO said ""less healthy people would face extremely high premiums, despite the additional funding that would be available."" ""Over time, it would become more difficult for less healthy people (including people with preexisting medical conditions) in those states to purchase insurance because their premiums would continue to increase rapidly,"" the CBO said. Health policy analyst Joe Antos at the American Enterprise Institute, a market-oriented think tank, said no one knows which states will ask for waivers, much less whether Georgia would. Also unknown is how states would change the rules for insurance companies. But even if states allowed insurance companies to charge higher rates for people with pre-existing conditions who let their coverage lapse, he said the maximum number of people who would be adversely affected would be relatively small. ""If they have insurance, they will try to keep it, because they know exactly that they will be big spenders and they want someone else to pay for it,"" Antos said. Antos said that there’s a ""distinct possibility"" that some people would face higher costs, but political pressure would limit how far states would go. Another mitigating actor is the billions of dollars in the American Health Care Act for states to set up high-risk pools. That money would move the most expensive patients off the private insurance rolls. Gail Wilensky, a top health care adviser to President George H.W. Bush, said that with enough funding, this could give such people better care than they get today. But Wilensky doesn’t think the current bill has set aside enough money. ""Protections are greater under the Affordable Care Act,"" Wilensky said. ""That’s why it costs as much as it does."" Matthew Fielder, a health policy fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that by design, the Republican proposal gives states more latitude. ""Under current law, people are completely protected against being charged a higher premium because of a pre-existing condition, no matter where in the country they live,"" Fiedler said. ""Under the American Health Care Act, those protections could be significantly curtailed or eliminated entirely, depending on the decisions made by state officials."" Ossoff said the American Health Care Act ""guts protections against massive price hikes for Georgians with pre-existing conditions."" Based on the CBO report, a sixth of all Americans live in states where people with pre-existing conditions would be priced out of the market. No one knows if Georgia would be such a state, or if it were, if it would use waivers to the fullest extent. No expert we reached said the proposed American Health Care Act insulates people from higher rates as much as the current Affordable Care Act does. They differed on the scale of the impact. Ossoff has a point that the protections are weaker, but he pushed too far on the specifics for Georgia.

Years-old story that Edward Snowden can prove Osama bin Laden lives in Bahamas is fake news
","A fake news story that said former NSA contractor Edward Snowden had proof that terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden was enjoying a taxpayer-funded lifetime vacation in the Caribbean has resurfaced after several years.

Ivanka Trump on target with figures on women in STEM fields
","During an interview on Fox & Friends, Ivanka Trump discussed the challenges facing women in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math -- collectively known as STEM. It was one of the themes of her recent book, Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success. In a discussion with the hosts about the nation’s employment picture, Trump raised the issue of where future jobs will be coming from. ""A lot of them are in STEM-related fields -- science, engineering, computer science,"" she said during the June 12, 2017, segment. ""Women, for example, while we represent 47 percent of the overall work force, we only make up 23 percent of STEM-related occupations."" When we looked into this statistic, we found that it’s not far off the mark. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Trump was correct about the percentage of the overall workforce that is female -- average Bureau of Labor Statistics data for 2016 finds precisely that figure, 47 percent. As for STEM employment, the most recent comprehensive data we could find was in a report published in 2016 by the National Science Board and the National Science Foundation, using 2013 statistics. The report found that in 2013, women represented 29 percent of individuals in science and engineering occupations. That’s higher than Trump’s 23 percent, although it supports her broader point -- that women are underrepresented in STEM fields. And if you recalculate the raw data in the report, you can get a few percentage points closer to Trump’s figure. In coming up with the 29 percent figure, the report counted jobs in the social sciences. Some may not think that such fields as political science and sociology are core STEM professions, so we ran the numbers without that subcategory. This meant removing a sector -- social sciences -- that is 62 percent women. The remaining fields --  which include mathematics, computer science, life sciences, chemistry, physics, geology and engineering -- are just over 25 percent female. That’s closer to Trump’s figure, but still a little high. It’s also worth noting that there is wide variation in the percentage of women from STEM field to STEM field. (Trump was referring to average figures, so we won’t lower her rating for this part of the equation.) For instance, in ""biological, agricultural, and environmental life scientists,"" there is almost gender parity, with 48 percent female, 52 percent male. In the field of non-practicing medical research, women actually have a majority of the positions, at 56 percent. By contrast, engineering as a whole is only 15 percent female. The percentages are even lower in certain specialties, such as aeronautical engineering (12 percent female), petroleum engineering (10 percent) and mechanical engineering (8 percent). When we ran our calculations by the National Girls Collaborative Project, a nonprofit group that specializes in increasing the number of girls and women in STEM fields, Erin Hogeboom, the group's community development and network strategy manager, said our analysis mirrors theirs. ""Women’s representation in STEM fields is distressingly lower than it should be, and the best way to support the argument for the need to change this is through accurate data,"" Hogeboom said. Our ruling Ivanka Trump said, ""While (women) represent 47 percent of the overall work force, we only make up 23 percent of STEM-related occupations."" She’s right on the first figure, and she’s close on the second, according to the most recent comprehensive data.

Kuster says Meals on Wheels a critical lifeline for seniors who have no one else
","New Hampshire could be considered one of the main exhibits of the ""silver tsunami,"" a term used to refer to the aging population in the United States. Tied for second in the nation for the oldest population in terms of median age, the state is bracing for the effects of a declining workforce, strained medical services and ballooning public retirement benefits. But economists’ focus on those issues fails to capture the experiences of seniors living alone in their homes – sometimes after all their peers have died. U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster reminded listeners this week of the isolation of needy seniors with a depressing statistic she picked up from a ridealong with a local Meals on Wheels program. Kuster, a Hopkinton Democrat who was discussing the potential detrimental effects of President Donald Trump’s proposed budget, said for 22 percent of home delivery participants, ""Meals on Wheels is the only human contact in their life from week to week, the only person they see."" The claim was striking. Do so many needy seniors in New Hampshire have no one else in their lives but the Meals on Wheels driver? Kuster made the statement to group of nonprofit officials from the fields of child care, mental health and nutrition. She said the cuts proposed in Trump’s budget outline, especially an 18 percent reduction to the Department of Health and Human Services, were ""so dramatic and so Draconian."" To be clear, the president’s budget is just a spending plan and it does not earmark any specific cuts to Meals on Wheels.  It's premature for us to project what could happen to Meals on Wheels spending, so we not checking whether Trump's budget is Draconian; rather, we’re examining Kuster’s claim about the lonely lives of New Hampshire seniors. Meals on Wheels is a national program that serves 2.4 million people. It’s funded partly through federal dollars and delivered more than 137 million meals in 2016. We reached out to Kuster, who said her claim was about New Hampshire Meals on Wheels recipients, not a nationwide statistic. The best figures on this subject are kept by a coalition of Meals on Wheels affiliates in six New Hampshire counties that all administer the same survey each year. These organizations cover both the most rural and also the most densely populated parts of the state. Meghan Brady is the longtime president of St. Joseph Community Services, which is based in Merrimack and is one of the members of the New Hampshire Coalition of Aging Services. As a group, the coalition served more than 1.1 million meals to more than 13,000 older and disabled adults in 2016, Brady said. It’s made up of the Community Action Program of Belknap-Merrimack Counties (in Concord), the Grafton County Senior Citizens Council (in Lebanon), Ossipee Concerned Citizens (in Center Ossipee), Tri-County Community Action Program (in Berlin) and St. Joseph Community Services (in Merrimack). In the fall, the coalition delivers a survey along with its meals to everyone who’s in the program at the time, she said. The return rate is better than half. ""On any given day, the likelihood is the delivery person is the only individual the Meals on Wheels recipient will see, but for 21 percent of them, the driver is the only person they’ll see all week,"" Brady said, quoting last year’s statewide statistics. For her program in particular, the 22 percent statistic that Kuster cited is dead on, she said. At the event Kuster's staffer offered a different statistic, but she said 22 percent, so we'll stick to that number. Brady, who has been working for St. Joseph Community Services for 22 years, said she’s seen this situation grow worse in recent years. ""Over the last several years, all of us have seen an increase in isolation and hunger,"" she said. ""We measure this by the annual surveys, by the requests we receive for additional food and by the number and type of follow-ups we do,"" such as calling social workers on clients’ behalves, putting them in touch with additional services and sometimes calling 911. Some of the other findings, she said, are significant: 63 percent reported that because of the Meals on Wheels program, they can continue to live in their homes, and 36 percent reported that they don’t always have enough money or food stamps to obtain the food they need without the deliveries. ""We have a gentleman who’s in our program who is 102. How old do you think his kids are?"" she asked. ""People are living longer. We have people who have outlived family and friends, so this is very important."" St. Joseph’s Community Services raises about 30 percent of its budget privately, she said, but it also relies on a few sources of government funding, which was the context in which Kuster originally made her claim. Some news media outlets reported Trump’s budget director allegedly claiming that Meals on Wheels is ""not showing results."" The Washington Post’s fact-checker investigated that claim and found  he never said that. As for the budget’s impacts on Meals on Wheels, it’s not exactly clear yet, Brady said. ""My understanding is that the proposed budget includes an 18 percent decrease at the Department of Health and Human Services at the federal level,"" she said. ""Two of our funding sources are in that area. What impact that cut would have, we do not know."" On thing that is clear in the budget is that it seeks to nix funding for a federal Housing and Urban Development program called Community Development Block Grants. Brady said her organization has received a $42,000 block grant, but that’s only a sliver of the total $3.6 million in revenue and support the nonprofit reported last year from the government and donors. Nationally, Meals on Wheels doesn’t keep data specific to human interaction, said Jenny Bertolette Young, the vice president of communications. ""We do know that 51 percent of home-delivered meal recipients live alone,"" she said in an email. ""One would assume that homebound recipients that live alone likely lack human contact outside of the Meals on Wheels volunteer."" She said it’s a ""common anecdote"" that the driver is oftentimes the only person a recipient will see in a given day. Our ruling Kuster said for 22 percent of Meals on Wheels home recipients, the driver ""is the only human contact in their life from week to week, the only person they see."" The depressing statistic is backed up by the data collected by a coalition of Meals on Wheels providers in New Hampshire.

Alison Lundergan Grimes says Mitch McConnell, not she, is taking money from anti-coal groups
","Not everyone agrees there’s a war on coal, as Republicans often charge, but there’s no question there’s a war over the war on coal in Kentucky’s high-profile Senate race. For months, Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell have lobbed accusations at each other, saying their opponent is too weak in supporting the state’s abundant fossil fuel. The latest salvo comes from Grimes, who has sustained accusations by McConnell that she wouldn’t fight back against the Environmental Protection Agency’s new proposal for regulating carbon emissions. In a recent ad — which begins with her ""approving"" the ad while appearing in a mine, helmet and all — she parries McConnell’s claim by launching her own coal-themed attack. ""What Mitch McConnell doesn’t want you to know is that he and his wife personally took $600,000 from anti-coal groups, including New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s anti-coal foundation,"" Grimes said. ""The only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is Mitch McConnell."" We’ll assess two parts of this claim. First, is McConnell ""pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal""? And second, is he the ""only candidate"" taking money from anti-coal activists? McConnell’s money When we asked Grimes for evidence that McConnell has received $600,000 from those who oppose coal, a Grimes spokeswoman said that McConnell’s wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, sits on the board of directors of Bloomberg Philanthropies, a charitable organization founded by the former New York City mayor and billionaire founder of the Bloomberg media conglomerate. In 2011, Bloomberg Philanthropies promised $50 million over four years to the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Initiative. The recipient had a decidedly anti-coal agenda, including an effort to close coal plants in many parts of the country. According to Yahoo! News, Bloomberg said, ""Ending coal power production is the right thing to do, because while it may seem to be an inexpensive energy source the impact on our environment and the impact on public health is significant."" However, Chao didn’t join the board until 2012. Bloomberg Philanthropies spokeswoman Meghan Womack told PolitiFact, ""The decision to provide funding to Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal initiative took place before Elaine Chao joined the Bloomberg Philanthropies board. Bloomberg Philanthropies’ board members do not vote on individual initiatives or program spends."" But the claim really goes off the rails when the ad says McConnell and Chao took $600,000 from anti-coal groups. Chao made far less than that — $9,400 — for serving on the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies, according to the organization’s latest annual filing in 2012. So how does the Grimes campaign get to $600,000? They also count the $684,186 in fees, stock options and other compensation that Chao made while serving on the board of directors for Wells Fargo. How can a bank be anti-coal? According to Yahoo! News, in 2013, Wells Fargo announced it would stop investing in companies that engage in mountaintop removal, a practice that involves extracting coal more or less by blowing up mountain summits. ""We recognize the significant concerns associated with this practice and we also acknowledge the significant investments made by our coal customers in their mine operations, which were entered into in good faith and in accordance with applicable regulations,"" Wells Fargo wrote in a report titled Environmental and Social Risk Management. ""As a result of our deliberate approach and the broader movement of the industry toward other mining methods, our involvement with the practice of (mountaintop removal) is limited and declining. Wells Fargo will not extend credit to individual MTR mining projects or to a coal producer that receives a majority of its production from MTR mining."" That’s not an insignificant development, but as the Washington Post Fact Checker noted in its own analysis of the ad, that only tells part of the story. For instance, Wells Fargo told the Washington Post, ""Given that we still finance coal companies, we would certainly not characterize ourselves as ‘anti-coal.’ "" Environmental groups, too, don’t agree that Wells Fargo is out to destroy coal. On the contrary, in 2012, Rainforest Action Network, Sierra Club, and BankTrack named Wells Fargo one of the top five worst banks on coal due to ""their relationship to and control over these dirty dinosaurs."" An updated report card from the groups released in 2014 gave Wells Fargo a ""B"" for its mountain-top removal investments, but the bank still scored a ""D"" for its ties to coal-fired power plants. There are certainly banks with a cozier relationship with coal and energy companies. But even though Wells Fargo says it does ""not finance coal-power plants on a stand-alone basis,"" Wells Fargo remains a bank that ""provided $1.9 billion in financing as a lead arranger or lead manager in transactions with coal-fired power companies,"" according to the environmental report. Grimes’ money How about the other side of the equation — that McConnell is the only candidate ""pocketing big money"" from anti-coal groups? As it happens, Grimes’ campaign has benefited some from groups and individuals that are critical of coal use. For starters, her campaign reported a $1,000 donation from Frances Beinecke, the president of the Natural Resource Defense Council. The NRDC was instrumental in helping the Obama administration develop the new carbon regulations on existing power plants. In October 2011, Susie Tompkins Buell, the founder of the women’s clothing line Esprit and a noted climate change activist, held a fundraiser for Grimes at her California home. Grimes’ campaign points out the McConnell has also accepted money from some donors with anti-coal ties. For example, McConnell received $2,000 in campaign contributions from David Litman, a Texas businessman who started Texas Business for Clean Air to oppose new coal plants there. Meanwhile, Grimes’ campaign has also benefited indirectly from outside groups that have helped in the ongoing ad wars in Kentucky without officially coordinating with her campaign. CREDO, a progressive organization with a campaign focused on fighting ""dirty coal,"" has spent $35,000 to air anti-McConnell ads so far, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog. Meanwhile, the Senate Majority PAC, a political arm of Senate Democrats, has put $4.3 million into the race. The PAC has received significant funding — about $5 million so far — from billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer. That’s not to say that Grimes’ campaign is bankrolled or heavily influenced by anti-coal organizations. Indeed, environmental groups have not jumped into the Kentucky Senate race to back Grimes with the same intensity as they have to help Democrats in states like Colorado and Michigan. But there’s enough financial support from anti-coal entities that Grimes’ claim of entirely clean hands is significantly misleading. Our ruling A Grimes ad claimed that ""the only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is Mitch McConnell."" The assertion is that McConnell and his wife took $600,000 from anti-coal organizations. But the overwhelming bulk of that was earned by Chao from sitting on the board of directors for Wells Fargo, a bank that, despite some steps to curb its support of mountain-top removal mining, still maintains $1.8 billion in coal investments, environmental groups say. Meanwhile, Grimes’ campaign has directly and indirectly benefited from money and ads from environmental groups and activists critical of coal.

O'Reilly: No Muslim government 'called out' those who celebrated after 9/11
","Bill Maher, cable show host and ardent atheist, ignited a cable television free-for-all when he said the Muslim world has ""too much in common with ISIS."" ISIS, of course, is one of the names for the forces of the Islamic State group which has engaged in beheadings and mass executions with ghastly regularity. Liberals have been critical of Maher for, they say, making sweeping generalizations of Muslims. Conservatives, meanwhile, have come to Maher’s defense. On Fox News, host Bill O’Reilly delivered one of his Talking Points commentaries on the question of whether Islam is a destructive force in the world. To a significant degree, O’Reilly answered in the affirmative. Among his reasons -- the governments of Muslim-majority nations have ""failed to confront Islamic terrorism (and) have not attacked violence in the name of Allah."" O’Reilly then played video that featured Palestinian youngsters jumping and smiling as news spread of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.  ""Thousands of Muslims, regular folks, celebrated in the streets,"" O’Reilly said. ""They were happy that more than 3,000 innocent people, including Muslims, were murdered. Again, these people are a minority but they were not called out in any official way by Muslim nations around the world."" O’Reilly is correct that public demonstrations in support of the 9/11 attacks took place. They largely occurred in the Palestinian territories, although we also found reports of one in Egypt. Middle East specialist Peter Mandaville, associate professor of government and politics at George Mason University, recalls them as ""small scale and localized."" But our fact-check is focused on the question of whether Muslim nations repudiated the celebrations. ""There was a report of (the) Palestinian Authority information minister at the time, Yaseer Abed Rabbo, appealing to Palestinians to not show happiness in response to the attacks, but no specific condemnation that I know of,"" Mandaville said. We found a couple of compilations of Muslim reaction in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. In addition to Mandaville, we contacted several researchers who study the Middle East. We found no instance when the government of a Muslim-majority nation chastised or condemned the people who were elated by the toppling of the World Trade towers and the other deadly events of that day. What we did find were many official condemnations of the attacks themselves. King Abdullah II of Jordan said, ""What these people stand for is completely against all the principles that Arab Muslims believe in."" The day after the attacks, Abdelouahed Belkeziz, Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, issued a statement saying he was ""denouncing and condemning those criminal and brutal acts that ran counter to all covenants, humanitarian values and divine religions foremost among which was Islam."" The Organization of the Islamic Conference (now called the Organization of Islamic Cooperation) represents all of the Muslim nations in the Middle East and worldwide. The group later issued a joint statement that spoke to ""the necessity of tracking down the perpetrators of these acts in the light of the results of investigations and bringing them to justice to inflict on them the penalty they deserve."" The League of Arab States said much the same thing, as did Islamic religious leaders in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and other countries. From Syria, Yemen, Pakistan and other nations, over 40 clerics and Islamic-oriented party leaders -- many with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, a movement that advocates for Sharia law -- signed a statement on Sept. 12, 2011, saying, ""We condemn, in the strongest terms, the incidents which are against all human and Islamic norms. This is grounded in the Noble Laws of Islam which forbid all forms of attacks on innocents."" So while it’s true that governments did not speak out against the jubilant Palestinians, there was broad rejection of the attacks from officials and top religious leaders. Nathan Brown, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, raised the possibility that the street celebrations loomed larger in America than elsewhere.   ""I remember them being reported in U.S. media since they seemed so outrageous,"" Brown said. ""But I do not know if they got any domestic attention in the countries where they were reported in U.S. media to have occurred. For instance, I remember Palestinian media reporting the blood donation made by Yasser Arafat but not anything about Palestinian celebrations."" Arafat had a photo-op with him donating blood to help the survivors of the 9/11 attacks, although later reports questioned whether he actually did. We did find several accounts of the Palestinian authorities attempting to seize video of the demonstrations, which could speak to how the events might have played in the region. Dubai-based Media Watch Middle East is a private firm that tracks the activities of news organizations throughout the region. We asked them to look for coverage of the celebrations. They reported that an ""extensive search"" of their database turned up nothing. Apart from official reaction, average Muslims attended candlelight vigils and other public events to voice sympathy for the victims and to repudiate the attacks. We found photos from Iran and Bangladesh. These demonstrations stand in sharp contrast to the video from the Palestinian territories. Our ruling O’Reilly said that Muslim nations did not ""call out"" the people who celebrated the 9/11 attacks. So far as we can tell, there was no official condemnation of people celebrating the 9/11 attacks. However, Muslim governments, and religious leaders, condemned the attacks themselves, as did many average Muslims. O’Reilly’s statement is accurate as far as it goes, but it leaves out important information that might lead someone to reach a different conclusion.

Obama: Health care is driving down the deficit
","Since the Affordable Care Act was first proposed, policymakers have been debating its potential effect not just on health care but on the economy as a whole. The bill effectively increases some types of spending, reduces other types and increases some taxes. President Barack Obama considers the health care legislation one of his economic success stories. ""Partly because health care prices have been growing at the slowest rate in nearly 50 years, the growth in what health care costs the government is down,"" Obama said in a speech about the economy last week at Northwestern University. ""Health care has long been the single-biggest driver of America’s future deficits. It’s been the single-biggest driver of our debt. Health care is now the single-biggest factor driving down those deficits."" We wondered: Is it true that ""health care is now the single-biggest factor driving down"" the federal budget deficit? We found that the claim is pretty well supported. To put it simply: A few years ago, economists predicted that net federal spending on health care would get very high, very fast -- fast enough to drive the deficit out of control. Now, by contrast, they predict that net federal spending on health care will grow, but not quite as fast as originally thought, making the deficit at least a little more manageable. The projections We know that the deficit has gone down quite a bit in the past few years -- from about 10 percent as a share of GDP in 2009 to about 3 percent this year. For future projections, we turned to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which frequently publishes budget outlook reports. In 2010, the CBO said the health care legislation, as proposed, would reduce the deficit by an estimated $124 billion over a decade when compared to projections that did not include the Affordable Care Act. The CBO has since said that economic conditions have changed, making this projection less reliable; CBO still says it will likely lower the deficit, but it has not pinned down a specific dollar value. In February, the CBO produced a report outlining general budget projections for the next decade, through 2024. In that report, they said the deficit over those 10 years would be a cumulative $7.9 trillion. Then, in April, CBO revised that calculation, shrinking the cumulative deficit over the next decade to $7.6 trillion -- $286 billion smaller than before. The CBO said this shrunken projection of the deficit largely had to do with lower estimates of the cost of Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies and Medicare. Between February and April, CBO lowered estimated spending over the 10-year period for Affordable Care Act-related expenses by 15 percent and lowered estimated spending on Medicare by 1.4 percent. Of course, this is a comparison between two scenarios that both take into account the Affordable Care Act. So some of these changes might have to do with costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, but those costs wouldn’t have existed if the law hadn’t been enacted in the first place. This trend holds for the long term, too, said David Rosnick, an economist at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. Rosnick pointed us to the CBO’s 75-year projection published in 2007, which was both before the recession and before the Affordable Care Act. That year, the CBO projected that the primary deficit (that is, the deficit not counting interest payments) in 2082 would be about 7.1 percent of GDP. By contrast, the 75-year budget outlook published in 2014 projects that the 2082 deficit will be around 2.4 percent -- significantly lower than previous projections. That coincides with lower projected spending on Medicare and Medicaid over the next several decades, Rosnick said. In 2007, the CBO predicted that Medicare and Medicaid spending would cost about 18.6 percent of GDP in 2082. But in 2014, the CBO predicted that Medicare, Medicaid and insurance subsidies would cost about 13.1 percent of GDP in 2082. Rosnick said the change in projected federal health care spending compared to the change in projected deficit shows that the former ""is the biggest factor driving down the long-run deficits."" Of course, the art of projecting deficits out to 2082 are far from exact -- that would be 21 years after Obama turns 100 -- and a lot of factors are at play. But we spoke with several budget experts who agree that health care is a major reason why CBO’s projections for future deficits are going down. Henry Aaron, a Brookings Institution senior fellow, said that while the spending cuts known as sequestration and ending certain tax cuts for the wealthy are helping to bring down the long-term deficit projections, health care is the main driver. ""The longer-term projections are now much less threatening than they were just a few years ago,"" he said. ""The big story is that health care spending growth is now projected to be much slower than it was projected to be just a few years back."" That said, there is debate among health economists over how much of the downward trend is specifically attributable to the Affordable Care Act. Mark McClellan, a former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George W. Bush, now at Brookings, said it’s unlikely the legislation itself is the main factor, since the slowdown in health care costs began before the law was enacted, and most of the cost contractions comes from areas of health care care that aren’t directly affected by the law. McClellan also noted a shorter-term concern: The main reason deficits are projected to rise over the next decade is spending on health care. CBO agrees. ""The pressures stemming from an aging population, rising health care costs, and an expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance would cause spending for some of the largest federal programs to increase relative to GDP,"" CBO said in July. Of course, we should note that the aging population would have happened independent of the Affordable Care Act, and health care costs were rising for years before the law was signed. Our ruling Obama said the cost of ""health care is now the single-biggest factor driving down"" the federal budget deficit. The CBO recently lowered its projection for long-term deficits and specifically cited health care costs as the main reason, though the Affordable Care Act is not necessarily the primary cause of that calculation. That said, even though projections are lower than they were years ago, health care spending is rising in the short term and will keep adding to the deficit.

Democrats accuse Southerland of seeking 'health care for life'
","Gwen Graham and U.S. Rep Steve Southerland are getting some help from their respective national parties in their hotly contested Panhandle Congressional district race. To bolster Graham, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is using a new commercial to revive an old attack. ""Congressman Southerland voted himself health care for life,"" the Sept. 30, 2014, ad says. This claim is followed by a laundry list of actions about which the DCCC thinks voters will dislike. Southerland’s office denied this, and when we’ve looked at this claim before, we took a dim view of such hyperbole. When a pro-Democratic group said Arkansas Republican Rep. Tom Cotton voted in favor of ""taxpayer-funded health care for life,"" PolitiFact rated it Pants On Fire! Let’s see how this claim fares on the Truth-O-Meter. Law of the land This gets a little complicated, so bear with us. The flap stems from the fact that Congress has to abide by the terms of President Barack Obama’s signature health care law as much as you do. Back in 2010, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa attached an amendment to the law requiring members of Congress to obtain health insurance through the exchanges touted by the bill. Before that, lawmakers bought insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, in which federal employees younger than 65 chose a plan and split premiums with the federal government. This is much like the way it works for anyone with an employee-sponsored group plan -- in this case, it’s just that their employer is the U.S. government. If Congress ever repealed Obamacare, the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program would return. And the GOP majority has been trying to repeal Obamacare for years now, voting to do away with or alter the law more than 50 times, depending on what you count. The commercial cites a July 11, 2012, vote on HR 6079, a repeal bill that netted a yes vote from Southerland. The congressman had plenty of other yes votes on similar bills -- his online House profile boasts that he has voted to ""to repeal, replace, and defund Obamacare over 40 times."" -- but the DCCC pointed to a story in The Hill about this specific instance. ""Not only are Republicans helping their insurance company donors, they’re also trying to help themselves,"" an unnamed Democratic official told The Hill in the July 9 article before the vote. ""House Republicans are set to repeal the promise that members of Congress have health care just like everyone else and to restart the perk of lifetime government health care for themselves."" Using that for proof is dubious, as the Democrats are basically citing one of their own anonymously as a source. They are essentially laundering a Democratic talking point through a nonpartisan newspaper. So let’s say Obamacare was magically legislated away and the old congressional system returns. Here’s the problem with the claim: Lawmakers and their aides don’t get to use the federal health plan forever. If a politician loses an election or an aide leaves their congressional job, they will no longer be eligible for the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program. Then, when they turn 65, Medicare will take over, but a lawmaker, if they choose, can keep their current plan in order to pay for things Medicare doesn’t cover. In either case, they still have to keep paying premiums. Meanwhile, in the real world, if a member of Congress is buying an insurance plan off an exchange, that coverage is subject to the same terms as anyone else’s policy. Again, if they don’t pay the premium, they don’t have coverage. That’s hardly guaranteeing any lawmaker lifetime health insurance. Southerland’s office pointed out the Panama City Republican voted in favor of the House’s budget resolution in April 2014. That bill encompassed the GOP’s budget policy, actually stating in part, ""Retirement benefits for Members of Congress should not include free, taxpayer-funded health care for life."" It passed along party lines and was sent to the Senate, where it is stalled. Our ruling The DCCC says Southerland ""voted himself health care for life."" This is a campaign tactic the Democrats have used before, referring to how members of Congress would get to fall back to the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program should Obamacare be repealed and its insurance marketplaces be shuttered. This federal program doesn’t last for life, but only as long as a member of Congress or an aide works for the federal government. It also switches over to Medicare when a lawmaker still in office turns 65.

Kay Hagan says federal government didn't create Common Core
","The Common Core education standards have not been popular with many Republicans, who say the guidelines will hamstring state school officials. At the debate for the U.S. Senate candidates from North Carolina on Oct. 7, Republican Thom Tillis described Common Core as regulatory overreach. Although he did not explicitly call it a federal mandate, his comments strongly implied that was the case: ""What I oppose,"" he said, ""is a bureaucracy, the Department of Education, that was not even created until 1980, after I graduated from high school, with 5,000 bureaucrats making on average $102,000 a year, stifling what teachers want to do in the classroom. The problem with Common Core is that teachers were being more worried about how they meet up to the standards than what they really want to do pursuing their passion educating the kids. Common Core, No Child Left Behind, Race To the Top all had strings attached to them."" That prompted incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan, a Democrat, to say that Common Core was not a federal mandate. ""The Common Core was not put together by the Department of Education in Washington,"" she said. ""It was put together by governors and by states, setting high expectations for students all across this country so that we could not only compete against one another within our states but we would be more competitive on a global basis."" Is Hagan correct that ""Common Core was not put together by the Department of Education in Washington. It was put together by governors and by states""? Common Core's origins Conservatives around the country have attacked the Common Core State Standards, a set of benchmarks for English and math that were unveiled in 2010. The criticism has stirred debate about the federal government's role and whether the focus on them is strictly political. PolitiFact Wisconsin has examined the question in different ways. A claim by Wisconsin State Sen. Joe Leibham that Common Core is a federal mandate earned a False rating in July. An opposite claim in October 2013 -- that Common Core ""is not from the federal government,"" that they ""do not have their fingerprints on this thing at all"" -- was rated Mostly True. The reality is that Common Core came out of years of discussion between private, nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal was to better prepare students for college and careers and to ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts. The Council of Chief State School Officers -- a national organization of public officials who head state education departments -- discussed developing common standards during its annual policy forum in 2007, a year before Barack Obama won the presidency. In 2009, that council and the National Governors Association agreed to create Common Core. They developed the standards with the help of teachers, parents and experts. Although Common Core is voluntary, the federal government has had a role in encouraging states to adopt the standards. States earned a small number of extra points (40 of a possible 500) in the competition for grants from Race to the Top, Obama’s signature program that provided added money for education, if they adopted standards to prepare students for college and work. They didn't have to adopt Common Core, but they were better positioned to secure the federal money if they did. Our ruling In the North Carolina debate, Hagan said, ""Common Core was not put together by the Department of Education in Washington,"" she said. ""It was put together by governors and by states."" She is right about how the program was assembled, although it’s worth noting that the federal government has given states financial incentives to adopt the standards.

Mary Burke says job growth has gotten worse every year of Scott Walker’s term
","Democratic candidate for governor Mary Burke wasted little time getting to Topic A -- Wisconsin job growth under Gov. Scott Walker -- during a Wisconsin Public Radio interview Sept. 29, 2014. Two and half minutes in, Burke ripped Walker for the number of jobs created in the three and a half years that he’s been in office. She then put a new spin on what is the central theme of her campaign. ""Frankly, it’s not getting any better,"" Burke told host Joy Cardin. ""The longer he’s in office, the worse it’s getting."" She continued:  ""So, 2013 job creation was worse than 2012, which was worse than 2011. And 2014 is shaping up to be the worst year ever, with the loss of 4,300 jobs in August alone."" Burke’s repeated this claim, most recently Oct. 6, 2014 in an interview on Postcrescent.com. In January 2014, we rated False a very similar claim by state Rep. Brett Hulsey (D-Madison), who failed in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.  But that was months ago and numbers are prone to change. Does Burke’s claim fare any better? In a word: No. Burke’s evidence When asked for backup, Burke spokesman Joe Zepecki essentially repeated the candidate’s claim: ""The longer he is in office the worse it gets -- 2013 was worse than 2011 and 2012. 2014 is on pace to be the worst year for job creation yet."" But he didn’t repeat it exactly. Burke said every year has been lower than the previous year -- like walking down the stairs. Zepecki said only that 2013 was worse than both 2011 and 2012. As support, Zepecki cited numbers for only two of the years: 33,872 jobs in 2012 and 29,723 in 2013. That’s OK, we’ve done this math before, and here is what it showed in terms of jobs added for each year: 2011 (Walker’s first full year in office): 29,800 2012: 33,872 2013: 29,723 So, the results show 4,072 more jobs created in 2012 (when compared with 2011), and then 4,149 fewer jobs created in 2013 (when compared with 2012). That’s not a series of steps down, but a step up and then a step down. The figures are from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ quarterly jobs count. They come from surveys of nearly all state employers and are regarded as the most accurate way of counting jobs. Burke’s observation that 2014 is on track to be the worst of all is based on monthly BLS jobs numbers, which are prone to much wider swings. So far, through August 2014, those numbers show the state has added 8,800 jobs in 2014. That doesn’t seem very good. But the eight-month mark has not always corresponded with the annual total. In 2011, after eight months, the state had added a total of 900 jobs for the year, according to the monthly estimates. The final total for the year, based on the more accurate Census figures, was 29,800. In 2012, there was a similar pattern -- minus 500 jobs after eight months, but a year-end total of 33,872. In 2013, there was less growth. There were an estimated 26,210 jobs after eight months, and the year-end total was 29,723. We have tracked Walker’s 2010 promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs in his four-year term on the Walk-O-Meter. Based on lagging numbers, and dwindling time, we have rated the pledge Promise Broken. You can see an updated monthly graphic tracking the state’s jobs performance since Walker took office here. Our rating Burke said job creation has gotten worse each year that Scott Walker’s been governor. The data says that’s not the case -- it’s been an up and down performance. And employers have continued to add jobs, albeit not at a strong pace. We rate the claim False.

Larger class sizes. Shorter school years. State austerity cuts to public education started in 2003 --- well before the Great Recession -- and they are not ending. But this year, they total $746.6 million, and that to educators, who can do the math, looked better than the $1 billion-plus-a-year cuts in each of the five prior years. ""We have been through tough times since the Great Recession started,"" Deal said during a candidate forum that was part of the annual meeting of the Professional Association of Georgia Educators’ foundation on September 15th.

Taxes on everything from personal and corporate income to gasoline and alcohol hit $17.8 billion that year, up $1.3 billion from 2006. Those same documents show that as the national and Georgia economies sank, so did state revenues. At the low point --- which was the fiscal year that ran from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010 -- total tax collection were about $14.5 billion -- or $3.3 billion off the peak. It wasn’t until Fiscal 2014, which ended June 30 of this year, that total state tax collections were back to -- and slightly above -- 2007 levels, budget documents show.

Thom Tillis says that Kay Hagan “voted to kill"" the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs
","In the second North Carolina Senate debate between Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan and Republican Thom Tillis, the challenger reached deep into the GOP playbook for an attack line about President Barack Obama’s health care law and its potential impact on jobs. ""Sen. Hagan’s solution is spending more money,"" Tillis said. ""It’s very simple. Government needs to get out of the way. We need to get our spending under control, and we need to reduce regulations. Sen. Hagan, when she cast the deciding vote for Obamacare, voted to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs."" Critics of the health care law have long argued that the new regulations it created, particularly those on businesses, would hamper employment -- or, in the more explosive language of the campaign trail, that it would be a ""job killer."" The critics got what seemed to be a boost when the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’ nonpartisan numbers-cruncher -- produced a report on this topic in February 2014. The CBO projected that by 2017, there would be the equivalent of about 2 million fewer workers than there would be in the absence of the law. CBO said that number would grow to about 2.5 million by 2024. However, most of the law’s critics glossed over some critical facts when citing these numbers. Why ""kill"" is the wrong word The biggest problem with Tillis’ characterization of the CBO’s findings is that he used the word ""kill."" This is inaccurate because it suggests that employers will be making 2.5 million layoffs, or because businesses aren’t going to be creating that many jobs. That's not what the report said; rather, the reduction will come primarily from voluntary choices by workers, not by employers. The CBO figured that, when presented with new options for purchasing health insurance outside their job, millions of people would decide they don’t need to work as much. The report estimated that Obamacare would ""reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor -- given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive."" This would equal a ""decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024,"" it continued. These changes, CBO said, would not result in ""an increase in unemployment (that is, more workers seeking but not finding jobs) or underemployment (such as part-time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week)."" To be clear, the report predicts that total employment will still rise. It just won’t rise as much as it would if the health care law did not exist. We should note that the report did have some less sanguine observations about the health care law’s impact on employment. As more people choose to work less, the CBO concluded, the labor force participation rate should decline, putting a larger burden for supporting the social safety net on those who remain working. Any change in labor force participation comes on top of an already major shift toward retirement driven by the aging of the baby boom. In addition, some commentators have expressed concern about having people work less because taxpayer-subsidized insurance is available. Ultimately, it boils down to a tradeoff, Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, told PolitiFact earlier this year. ""Admittedly there are some touchy issues with the government potentially paying or subsidizing the health care costs for people who could work but choose not to,"" Sinclair said. ""But overall I think separating health care from employment, at least making it like any other service where employment may provide the money to pay for it but where we work doesn't determine our choices, is a good thing."" To his credit, Tillis -- unlike many of his Republican colleagues -- was able to avoid one linguistic pitfall. Tillis framed the CBO’s findings as projecting a reduction in the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs, rather than simply saying a reduction of 2.5 million jobs. That’s an important distinction because the CBO didn’t cite the number of jobs that will be reduced; rather, it referred to full-time-equivalents of jobs. That may seem deep in the weeds, but it’s worth noting. These job equivalents will be made up of lots of bits and pieces of hours per week that people will choose to drop. For instance, some of these people might be working two or three jobs, in excess of 40 hours a week, and will choose to cut back to a more reasonable one or two jobs. A final note: We’re also not wild about Tillis’ characterization of Hagan casting the ""deciding vote"" for Obamacare.

Kay Hagan ""voted to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs."" The main problem with this claim is that Tillis used the word ""kill.""

In debate, Kay Hagan says Thom Tillis cut education by $500 million
","Education spending was a point of contention in the North Carolina Senate debate on October 7, when Sen. Kay Hagan repeated a popular Democratic talking point that Thom Tillis and state House Republicans are responsible for cuts to school funding. Sen. Hagan said Tillis ""has cut $500 million from public education and, you know what that means folks? That means fewer teachers in the classroom. That means larger classroom sizes and that means outdated textbooks if there’s any textbooks at all.""   Back in June we checked the same claim from a television ad sponsored by Women Vote, an arm of EMILY's List, a political action committee that supports Democratic women who are in favor of abortion rights. Where did the cuts come from? When we looked at North Carolina's education budget year to year, it has increased every year since Tillis became speaker in 2011. According to a document prepared by the General Assembly, the state education budget was $10.8 billion in the 2010-11 fiscal year and $11.5 billion for 2014-15. (These numbers are adjusted for inflation and include both K-12 and higher education spending.) Additionally, state expenditure per pupil for K-12 has increased since 2011 -- from $5,156 in 2011 to $5,395 in 2013. Education spending in North Carolina comes from a combination of federal, state and local dollars. State funding accounts for more than 62 percent of expenditures. So did Sen. Hagan and Women Vote pull that $500 million cut out of thin air? No, but it's complicated. Each year, the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management creates a continuation budget, which is a tool that outlines how much should be spent to maintain the current service level, without cutting or adding services. The projection might be larger or smaller than previous years because it takes into account factors such as inflation, population growth and operating new facilities. Lawmakers are not obliged to match the continuation budget. For the 2013-15 budget, the state budget office proposed a continuation budget of about $23.6 billion for those two years to maintain the status quo across K-12 and higher education. The budget that state lawmakers passed came up to about $23.1 billion. In total, lawmakers allocated $481 million less than the the continuation budget suggested. (EMILY's List pointed us to this when we asked about the ad back in June.) That shortfall ended up dividing the political parties in North Carolina: Last year, Tillis took to the floor to push lawmakers to pass the budget, while Democrats bashed the bill primarily because they believed the education allocations weren't adequate. The bill passed 65-53 in the House and 32-17 in the Senate, with no Democratic votes in favor. It’s important to note that the Legislature’s choosing to fund at levels lower than the continuation budget is not a literal budget cut. In raw dollars, the state is spending more money than in previous years. However, Tillis’ critics say it has the same effect as a cut. ""If you’re not doing what it takes to maintain the status quo, it’s a cut,"" said Hagan spokeswoman Sadie Weiner. Some other critics of Tillis’ education record have noted that state funding for K-12 education in North Carolina is about $500 million less than pre-recession levels. In the 2013-14 school year, public school spending was about $7.9 billion. In 2008-2009, it was $8.4, when adjusted for inflation. The budget affecting the 2014-15 school year eliminated 5,200 teachers, 3,800 teacher assistants and about $115 million for textbooks and instructional supplies, among other services, Philip Price, CFO for the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, told us in June. It also increases student-teacher ratios. The budget added a small number of new programs, but the vast majority of state education spending growth over the years comes down to rising healthcare and retirement costs. ""That doesn’t help the students,"" Price said. ""It doesn’t mean you get more teachers. It doesn’t change what is available to that classroom."" Reductions in federal and local education spending -- as well as funding shifts due to rising charter school popularity -- could also be a major reason why schools feel as if their funds have shrunk, despite a steadily increasing state budget, said Terry Stoops, director of research and education policy at the John Locke Foundation, a North Carolina think tank that promotes limited government. He added that between 2010 and 2013, federal funding to North Carolina schools dropped by $337.6 million. But when the federal government stopped giving North Carolina schools stimulus funding, the state did not pick up the slack, Price said. The state's shrinking spending on classroom services is part of a trend that has been going on since the recession -- back to when Democrats controlled the General Assembly -- and can't be solely blamed on one speaker of the house, he added. Our ruling Sen. Hagan’s statement attacking Tillis said he ""has cut $500 million from public education."" Literally, the statement is wrong. As North Carolina's Speaker of the House, Tillis helped pass a budget in 2013 that increased actual spending on education in comparison to previous years. But the budget spent almost $500 million less than what was requested to maintain the status quo, accounting for inflation and increased costs of various services. Additionally, the actual budget increase had a lot to do with rising costs of employee benefits, and not a lot to do with money that ends up in the classroom.

Lars Larson says Oregon driver card could be used to board a plane; is he right?
","Conservative radio talk show host Lars Larson makes no bones about where he stands on Oregon’s Measure 88 – the driver card initiative. If voters approve it in November, Oregon would join 10 other states and the District of Columbia in issuing driver cards to those who can’t prove they are in the U.S. legally. Larson staunchly opposes the measure and takes every opportunity to say so on his daily broadcast. The claim: He recently sent us a series of emails, which he said verified one of his assertions about the cards: That the Transportation Security Administration will accept ""driver privilege"" cards as valid identification to board a commercial aircraft. ""I have talked to the tsa and have emails to back up the fact that TSA WILL ACCEPT DRIVERS PRIV CARDS FOR ID AT THE AIRPORT,"" he wrote in one. The ballot title for the measure, however, says: ""The driver card may not be used as identification for air travel, to enter a federal building, to register to vote or to obtain any government benefit requiring proof of citizenship or lawful presence in United States."" Could the ballot measure’s own language be wrong? PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. The analysis: Several newspaper opinion pieces, including one written by former Hillsboro Police Chief Ron Louie, say driver cards will not be valid for boarding an airplane. Causa Oregon, a leading immigrant-rights group, agrees. ""Ballot Measure 88 clearly states that it will be issued only to grant driving privileges, and prohibits use of the driver cards for anything other than the listed purposes,"" spokesman Erik Sorensen wrote us in an email. But Oregon’s Driver and Motor Vehicles Services division added confusion in a ""frequently asked questions"" document prepared for Measure 88. In response to the question, ""Can I use a Driver Card as identification to board an airplane?"" the document says: ""It will be up to the TSA or the individual airport to determine whether to accept the Driver Card as identification."" A TSA spokesman in Washington D.C. wrote to Larson, according to an email he shared with us: ""Driver’s licenses are a valid form of ID for TSA."" We contacted a TSA official on our own, Nico Melendez, a Western Region TSA spokesman in California. Melendez, after checking with Oregon officials and administration attorneys, said in a telephone interview: ""State-issued driver cards would be acceptable forms of identification for our document-checkers at the airport. At this point, the understanding is that a card like this would be an acceptable form of identification."" Whether an air passenger shows a TSA representative a driver’s license or driver card doesn’t matter, he said. ""What we are doing is verifying that the person who shows the card is the person who is traveling,"" Melendez said. ""It’s not an immigration check."" The ruling: Oregon voters on Nov. 4, 2014, will decide the fate of Measure 88, which, if passed, will allow DMV to issue driver cards to Oregon residents who can’t prove legal residency. Supporters and the ballot measure itself say the cards could not be used to board airplanes. But TSA officials – the people checking passengers onto planes -- say otherwise.

Ben Affleck's claim that 'ISIS couldn't fill a Double A ballpark' in West Virginia, fact-checked
","Ben Affleck is in the news for more reasons than new thriller Gone Girl. The activist-actor’s defense of Islam in a confrontational appearance on HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher is generating headlines of its own. Maher argued in two recent shows that the beliefs and actions of Islamic State, while widely decried as extreme, are not all that different from the core tenets of Islam practiced by Muslims around the world. Affleck called that an unfair generalization of Muslims, which number about 1.6 billion people and represent the world’s second-largest religion. Affleck then used a tongue-in-cheek comparison to speak to the size of the Islamic State versus the number of Muslims worldwide. ""ISIS couldn't fill a Double A ballpark in Charleston, W. Va.,"" Affleck said. It’s clear Affleck’s comment was at least partially intended to draw laughs, but he used it to strengthen his argument that the number of Islamic State fighters pales in comparison to the Muslim population overall. That’s worth a second look. So for this fact-check, we wanted to learn what we could find out about the size of the Islamic State and see how it stacks up to the seating capacity of the minor league baseball team he had in mind. The size of the Islamic State The U.S. government has had a hard time pinning down the precise number of jihadist fighters within the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS and ISIL. Part of the problem is the group has grown quickly as it has captured more ground in Syria and Iraq. Over the summer, it was widely reported that the U.S. government estimated about 10,000 fighters in the al-Qaida-linked group. In September, the CIA more than doubled the group’s estimated size to between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters. In a statement to PunditFact, the CIA public affairs office explained the figure is based on intelligence reports collected from May to August. The CIA attributes the growth to ""stronger recruitment since June following battlefield successes and the declaration of a caliphate, greater battlefield activity, and additional intelligence."" At least 2,000 of the fighters reportedly have Western passports, too. Non-U.S. reports say the Islamic State is potentially much larger.  RT, the Russian government-sponsored English news organization, quoted an Iraqi intelligence adviser as saying the Islamic State numbered 100,000 in August. Al Jazeera reported that the Islamic State had an army of 50,000 troops in August. A Kurdish security official told 60 Minutes in September there were 40,000 Islamic State fighters. It’s hard to say which estimate is the best, but we think using the U.S. figure is certainly defensible, given that the other estimates do not come from named or official government sources. So would ISIS members fail to fill the ""Double A ballpark"" in Charleston, W. Va., that Affleck had in mind? The West Virginia Power Affleck’s example of a small-scale baseball stadium is not a hypothetical. There is indeed a minor league team in Charleston. The city is home to the West Virginia Power, a Class A affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates since 2009. The Power plays at Appalachian Power Park, which has a maximum seating capacity of 4,500 for baseball games, said Adam Marco, the team’s radio broadcaster and marketing director. The park could hold up to 11,000 people for charity events and concerts that would allow people onto the field, he said. So, assuming Affleck meant stadium seats, even the lowest estimate of Islamic State fighters would be way too much for the stadium. The story for Double A teams, which is what Affleck said even though the West Virginia is Class A, is no different. The largest Double A team stadium belongs to the Jacksonville Suns, which can hold 11,000 fans, said Minor League Baseball spokeswoman Mary Marandi. Curious, we asked Marco why he thought Affleck, a rabid Boston Red Sox fan, would allude to the West Virginia Power on TV. His theory: Affleck’s wife, actress Jennifer Garner, grew up in Charleston. ""I know Jennifer was at a game this past summer,"" Marco said. ""But in my five years here, I can’t say that I’ve seen him at a game. But that’s not to say it hasn't happened."" Our ruling Affleck said, ""ISIS couldn't fill a Double A ballpark in Charleston, W. Va."" It’s not every day we consult the CIA and a minor league baseball team for the same fact-check (of an Oscar-winning actor), but here’s what we found: The minor league stadium in question would not provide enough seating room for Islamic State fighters, even when using the U.S. government’s outdated, low estimate of 10,000. The CIA now uses a much higher estimate of 20,000-31,500 fighters, and other reports indicate it could be even higher. The Islamic State is small, but not Double A-baseball park small.

Obeidallah: Saudi Arabia is the only Muslim nation where women can't drive
","The comments about Islam from comedian, social critic and cable talk show host Bill Maher continue to stir reactions across the TV dial and across the political spectrum. Maher has said that when Muslim nations suppress political rights and deny freedoms to women, homosexuals and minorities, they are fair game for harsh criticism. The verbal fracas centers on whether Maher and others paint Islamic countries with too broad a brush. American comic Dean Obeidallah argued that Maher went too far. ""You can criticize Muslims,"" Obeidallah said on MSNBC’s The Ed Show on Oct. 6. ""It’s about doing it responsibly. Don't pick and choose and cherry-pick facts to define us by our worst examples. ... Like Saudi Arabia, women can't drive. That’s outrageous."" But, Obeidallah said, ""that's the only Muslim country out of 47 Muslim-majority countries that does that."" We thought we’d run that number down. We asked Obeidallah and he said not only is it accurate within the Muslim world, but Saudi Arabia might be the only country worldwide that doesn’t let women drive. He pointed to an NPR story that said the oil-rich nation holds that dubious distinction, although it clarified ""while there is no law formally banning female drivers, the government does not give them licenses."" Some Saudi women have gotten behind the wheel and driven in plain sight to challenge the country’s policy. We went through a list of Muslim-majority nations and from everything we found, Obeidallah is correct about Saudi Arabia’s unique status. Another country that blocked women from driving did not show up. (For the record, our list had 51 nations, not 47. And there's another list that has 49. But we won't quibble over that.) John Esposito is a leading expert on Islam and a professor of International Affairs and Islamic Studies at Georgetown University. We asked him if Saudi Arabia was the sole Muslim nation with this policy regarding women. ""Yes,"" Esposito said. Even within Saudi Arabia’s religious community, you can find arguments on both sides of the issue. On the website Islam Question and Answer, the justification of the prohibition lies in the Koran. The site operates under the Saudi Sheikh Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid. ""It is well known that (driving) leads to evil consequences which are well known to those who promote it, such as being alone with a non-mahram (marriageable) woman, unveiling, reckless mixing with men, and committing haraam (sinful) actions because of which these things were forbidden."" But Islam Today, another website under the auspices of a different Saudi religious leader, Sheikh `Abd al-Wahhâb al-Turayrî, reaches a different conclusion. ""There is nothing in Islamic Law that prohibits a woman from driving an automobile,"" according to the website. ""In Saudi Arabia, the state considers it to be in the best interests of the people to enact laws restricting driving for certain sectors of the population, and that it falls within the state’s jurisdiction to do so. The law in Saudi Arabia that prevents women from driving is considered one of these laws. It is therefore not to be understood as an Islamic teaching."" Obeidallah clearly subscribes to the second view. ""There is zero basis in the Koran to ban women from driving, or we would see some other Muslims country doing it,"" Obeidallah said. ""It's not a Muslim thing, it's a Saudi thing!"" Our ruling Obeidallah said Saudi Arabia is the only Muslim-majority nation that doesn’t allow women to drive.

Steinem: More women killed by partners since 9/11 than deaths from attacks, ensuing wars
","When pundits really want the scope of a big issue to hit home, they sometimes relate it to events that are universally affecting, like Sept. 11 or deaths of soldiers from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Feminist activist Gloria Steinem used both to illustrate the prevalence of domestic violence amid recent high-profile NFL scandals. ""When we think of violence against women, for instance, we understandably think mainly of other countries, where the degree of violence is much higher,"" Steinem is quoted as saying in an Oct. 1, 2014, Associated Press story. ""But what is also true is that if you added up all the women who have been murdered by their husbands or boyfriends since 9/11, and then you add up all the Americans who were killed by 9/11 or in Afghanistan and Iraq, more women were killed by their husbands or boyfriends."" A reader wanted to know if her factoid is accurate. It is. Females killed by intimate partners The Justice Department offers a breakdown of homicides with female victims, more than one-third of which involve ""intimate partners,"" which could be current or former (or male or female). From 2002 to 2012, the number of women killed by intimate partners was 15,462, according to data from James A. Fox, a Northeastern University criminology professor who adjusted federal data for unsolved homicide cases believed to be linked to intimate partners. Another tally, this one from a 2013 U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report, shows 10,470 women killed in intimate partner homicides from 2002 to 2010. (That tally should be higher, too, because it does not account for the 3.5 months that followed Sept. 11, 2001.) In summary, it’s possible that some female victims were killed by female ""intimate partners,"" but we don't know for sure because the data isn't broken down that way. But because the available data also excludes recent years, the true number is likely higher overall. Deaths from 9/11 and the wars Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks on Sept. 11, including the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York, the plane crash at the Pentagon and the fourth crash in a small field in rural Shanksville, Pa., according to a 10-year memorandum on the Sept. 11 attacks from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. Specifically, the consortium counts 2,997 deaths, which shrinks if you deduct the 19 jihadists. Also, a few people have died in recent years due to complications from injuries and conditions related to 9/11. Bottom line: The figure is less than 3,000 if you count only ""Americans"" as Steinem said. (People from 90 different countries died in the attacks, according to the U.S. State Department.) As for the wars, the U.S. Department of Defense releases a daily count of casualties involving military and government personnel from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The American death count for Operation Iraqi Freedom, which began in March 2003 and was renamed Operation New Dawn in 2010, is 4,491 deaths. There have been 2,210 total American deaths in Afghanistan stemming from Operation Enduring Freedom, which started with airstrikes in Afghanistan on Oct. 7, 2001. Another 134 Americans have died in places outside of Afghanistan in work related to the operation, and three civilian Defense Department employees were also killed in this effort. That brings the total to 2,347. So the total deaths from Sept. 11 and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is a maximum of 9,838. It’s lower when we exclude non-American victims on Sept. 11. Our ruling Steinem said that more women were killed by their husbands or boyfriends since Sept. 11 than ""all the Americans who were killed by 9/11 or in Afghanistan and Iraq."" You can argue about the significance of such a comparison, but on the numbers, Steinem is accurate. Since Sept. 11, 2001, more women  have been killed by ""intimate partners"" -- the federal jargon for current or former spouses -- than all of the victims in Sept. 11 and the American victims in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that ensued.

Charlie Crist says Rick Scott signed laws requiring ultrasounds and restricting abortion
","In his quest for the women’s vote. Democrat Charlie Crist continues to attack Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s record on abortion. ""After it happened, Rick Scott threw a party back at the mansion. What was he celebrating?"" says the Sept. 30 TV ad. ""This: with a stroke of a pen Scott passed some of the most extreme anti-choice laws in the country. Laws requiring mandatory ultrasounds and restricting access to abortion, even in cases of rape or incest."" ""Rick Scott celebrated taking away your voice and your choice,"" the ad concludes. We have written a lot about Crist’s record of conflicting statements about abortion -- though in this campaign he has been endorsed by Planned Parenthood. Scott, meanwhile, has consistently favored abortion restrictions. We wanted to know if the ad accurately presented what Scott signed into law. We found it was largely correct; Scott did sign legislation that restricted access to abortion. But there a few details here that are important. Scott signed ultrasound bill in 2011 In 2011, Scott signed four abortion-related bills, including one that required all women to receive an ultrasound before undergoing an abortion. Crist had vetoed a similar ultrasound law in 2010, calling it ""almost mean-spirited."" That was shortly after he left the GOP for his failed bid as an independent candidate for U.S. Senate. The law Scott signed requires women to get the ultrasound as well as an opportunity to review the ultrasound and have it explained to them. (Women can decline to review the ultrasound if they sign a form.) Previously, Florida law required ultrasounds prior to second trimester or later abortions, not first trimester abortions. Though the former law didn’t require first trimester ultrasounds, 29 of 31 abortion clinics did them anyway. The Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog reported that a month after signing the bills in 2011, Scott held a ceremonial signing with dozens of abortion opponents -- that’s the ""party"" that the ad references. ""You should have the opportunity to see see an ultrasound of your child,"" Scott said in 2011. ""It's your choice. You don't have to. This creates choice. I think it's very positive."" Abortion law about viability in 2014 Crist’s ad also says Scott signed a law ""restricting access to abortion even in cases of rape or incest."" That refers to HB 1047, which Scott signed in 2014 to change the timeline for cutting off abortions. The bill banned abortions once a fetus is considered viable, which is typically around 23 or 24 weeks of gestation. Previously, Florida banned abortions in the third trimester, or starting about two weeks later than the new restriction. The main purpose of the 2014 bill was to make all abortions occur earlier -- no matter if the pregnancies were a result of rape or incest. The new law only allows abortion after the point of viability to save the woman’s life or prevent major permanent damage ""other than a psychological condition."" It doesn’t mention rape or incest. The previous law didn’t mention rape or incest, but it did include a broad exception to ""preserve the health of the pregnant woman."" That broad language was what some people interpreted to potentially include rape or incest survivors. In reality, however, no woman has received a third-trimester abortion under any exception between 2011 and so far in 2014, according to state data. In 2013, 91 percent of abortions were in the first trimester and 9 percent in the second trimester, according to state data. So that means that women who want to terminate pregnancies that occurred as a result of rape or incest can still do so in the first semester and most of the second trimester -- depending on when a doctor determines viability. Rape and incest are rarely cited in abortions, according to state data. In 2013 there were about 73,000 abortions -- two were in cases of incest and about 272 due to rape -- so combined that equals less than one percent. At the time, Scott spokesman John Tupps wrote in a statement about the law that ""Gov. Scott is pro-life and was glad to sign this bill that protects the lives of children."" We asked Scott campaign spokesman Greg Blair if Scott supports the rape/incest exception throughout pregnancy or only until the point of viability and Blair told us that he supports those exceptions in ""all cases."" We asked why Scott then signed the law this session that doesn’t include those exceptions. We didn’t get a response. Finally, the ad said Scott signed ""some of the most extreme anti-choice laws in the country."" That’s a subjective call, but we should note that Florida hasn’t had widespread clinic closures. A Texas law caused 13 abortion clinics to close there. In Florida, there were 68 abortion clinics when Scott took office and there are 65 now. (Seven closed under Scott, but four new ones opened.) And, Florida had restrictive laws about abortion before Scott took office. Americans United for Life, a group that opposes abortion rights, ranked Florida 26th among states for restricting abortion in 2010 and 25th among states in 2014. NARAL, an organization that supports abortion rights, has given an ""F"" to about half the states, including Florida. Our ruling Crist said in an ad that Scott signed ""laws requiring mandatory ultrasounds and restricting access to abortion even in cases of rape or incest."" Scott signed a law in 2011 that requires ultrasounds for all women before they get an abortion, and in 2014 he signed a law that stated women could not have an abortion after the point of viability. That means women could not have an abortion about two weeks earlier than before. The only stated exception was to save the woman's life.  However, the previous law didn’t expressly include those exceptions either, though it had broad language that could potentially have been used to seek abortion for a rape or incest survivor in the third trimester. No woman, though, has had an abortion in Florida during the third trimester for any reason in recent years, even before the new law. The statement is accurate, but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/07/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-rick-scott-signed-laws-ultrasounds-a/

Sen. Kay Hagan says Thom Tillis refuses to say what he would do to combat ISIS
","One of the most pressing foreign policy issues -- stopping the terrorist group known as Islamic State or ISIS -- has become a point of contention in the race for U.S. Senate in North Carolina. It started when Republican challenger Thom Tillis released a TV ad accusing incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan of missing key meetings of the Senate Armed Services Committee about terrorism. Hagan then responded that Tillis has been too vague about how to respond to ISIS. One Hagan statement issued Oct. 3 said that Tillis ""has ducked and dodged"" when asked how he would respond and that he ""refuses to say what we should do to combat ISIS."" We already looked at whether Hagan missed committee meetings; we rated Tillis’ statement Mostly True. Here, we wanted to take a deeper look at Tillis’s statements on his position on how to eliminate ISIS. We found Tillis, the speaker of the North Carolina House, has offered few specifics about how he would respond. Sept. 3, no specifics: In his first debate with Hagan, when asked if the United States should ""strike ISIS in Syria,"" Tillis said, ""I think that the U.S. needs to take all actions to protect American citizens, and to protect freedom-loving people all over the country."" The Fayetteville Observer noted that, ""When asked if the U.S. should launch air strikes against the Islamic State in Syria following the beheadings of two captured American journalists, neither Hagan nor Tillis directly answered the question with a ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ "" Sept. 10, continued air strikes: In a press release, Tillis said, ""We need a strategy to destroy ISIS, and now is not the time to mince words. ISIS is an evil and dangerous terrorist organization that has proven they will murder innocent Americans … We need to continue air strikes until the president can be assured that ISIS’s own enemies in the region will eliminate them on the ground. No option should be left off the table. "" Sept. 16, open to options, but concerned about arming rebels: Tillis spokesman Daniel Keylin told the Charlotte Observer  that Tillis believes ""no options should be left off the table to protect our national security."" Keylin added that, ""Even the president was against arming them (the Syrian rebels) a year ago, in part because of the risk that American weapons could end up in the hands of terrorists. Thom still has that concern today, he doesn’t want American weapons ending up in the hands of ISIS terrorists."" Sept. 18, vague on arming Syrian rebels: At a campaign event in Fayetteville, N.C., Tillis declined to say whether he supports arming Syrian rebels. ""We've got to know who these people are and if they go anywhere that they don't get into unfriendly hands,"" Tillis said. ""I am not convinced those are the so-called unfriendly rebels. There's a civil war going on there, and a lot of things need to be thought out."" Sept. 25, still unsure about arming Syrian rebels: In a phone interview with the Raleigh News & Observer, Tillis said he was unsure what he thought was the best course of action in regard to arming the Syrian rebels. ""I actually don’t know if we should or shouldn’t,"" Tillis said. ""I would have to know that these arms would not get in the hands of people who would want to take over the Middle East."" Sept. 29, all options on the table: In a statement about a new TV ad, Tillis said, ""While I support keeping all options on the table to completely destroy ISIS, the president and Kay Hagan still have no strategy and continue to lead from behind,"" Tillis said. Sept. 30, still vague: In an interview with FoxNews.com on Sept. 30, Tillis again repeated that the destruction of ISIS was the end goal, but gave no indication of how he would go about achieving that. ""Anything short of a strategy that calls for and achieves the complete elimination of ISIS and any emerging threats is unacceptable,"" Tillis said. The Fox News article added that Tillis ""was unclear when asked what he would do in Hagan's position. He said only that his decision would be based on what military officials told him and that as a ‘private citizen’ he could not comment on what he’d do or how he’d vote."" Our ruling Hagan said Tillis ""refuses to say what we should do to combat ISIS."" We reviewed Tillis’ public statements on the issue and found that he has provided few specifics. The majority of his remarks do not indicate what action he would take to respond to the ISIS threat. The most specific thing he’s said is that he supported continued air strikes in Syria on ISIS, but he later broadened that to say he supported  all options. And while he once said arming the Syrian rebels was reckless, he later said all options were on the table. We rate Hagan’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/07/kay-hagan/sen-kay-hagan-says-thom-tillis-refuses-ISIS/

Perdue misses mark on amnesty allegation
","Political discourse often relies on shorthand to make a point. Opponents of health care reform raised the specter of euthanasia with ""death panels, a widely mocked term that earned PolitiFact’s inaugural Lie of the Year in 2009. The bill that created health care reform is now known as Obamacare by both those who support and those who deride it. Then, there is amnesty. Technically referring to blanket forgiveness for a crime, in political circles the word refers to President Ronald Reagan’s 1986 immigration reform that granted illegal immigrants legal status if they could prove they were in the United States by Jan. 1, 1982 and meet other minimum requirements. The measure’s failure to slow illegal immigration has made it a charged political term, like the one Republican Senate hopeful David Perdue has lobbed against his Democratic rival, Michelle Nunn. ""She’s for amnesty, while terrorism experts say our border breakdown could provide an entry for groups like Isis,"" Perdue says in his ad, Secure Our Borders. With the nationally prominent race between Perdue and Nunn tight, we decided to take the amnesty claim for a spin on the Truth-O-Meter. Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey said the claim is based on statements Nunn made during a Chamber of Commerce forum in August. Speaking at the event, Nunn said she did not support President Obama taking any executive action on immigration. Nunn said she would have voted for the Senate immigration bill that passed last year. Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida spearheaded that bipartisan bill, which was co-sponsored by Democratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York and supported by 13 other GOP Senators, including former Republican presidential candidate John McCain. At the same forum, Perdue told the crowd that immigration should first focus on securing the border. That is the same point the ad is trying to make, Dickey said. ""Nothing has gotten done because we can’t come to consensus, and in the meantime, our borders are left unsecured,"" Dickey said. ""Only when we are done with securing our border can you talk about what comes next."" That brings us back to the bill, which stalled in the GOP-controlled House.   Similar to the previous amnesty bill, it would allow illegal immigrants to seek ""provisional immigration status"" by proving they were in the United States by Dec. 31, 2011. The new bill also would require those applicants to have no felony convictions, no more than two misdemeanors and to pay a $500 penalty plus back taxes. Another $500 penalty would be due in six years and, after 10 years, applicants could pay $1,000 to seek a green card. It would be a 13-year process for most of the 11.5 million undocumented immigrants to achieve permanent residency or pursue citizenship (children brought as minors and agricultural workers qualify for shorter waits). Before that process could begin, though, the bill would have required the federal government to double the number of U.S. border patrol agents, build 700 miles of fencing along the 2,000-mile U.S. border with Mexico and further fortify security with radar and unmanned drones and biometric tracking at 30 of the nation’s biggest airports. The requirements to spend billions on border control, before allowing for a pathway to citizenship, has muddied the water even for fact checkers. At times, PolitiFact has ruled claims of amnesty as Half True and Mostly False. Our friends at FactCheck.org, meanwhile, have come down to say the Senate bill is not amnesty. Nunn’s camp cites much of the same reasons as Factcheck.org, saying the term amnesty mischaracterizes the depth of the bill and requirements placed on both the government and undocumented immigrants before citizenship is even on the table. Support of the bill also means Nunn supports increased border control and security, said spokesman Nathan Click. ""The ad lies about Michelle's position on immigration, one that is widely shared by Republicans and the Chamber of Commerce,"" Click said, noting the right-leaning group supported the bill but has repeatedly said it does not support amnesty. ""David Perdue’s ad is a dishonest political smear, plain and simple,"" Click added. Very little in the immigration debate has been simple. Last year’s proposed immigration overhaul drew bipartisan support in the Senate but a conservative backlash in the House. Technically, the proposal includes an amnesty provision by erasing the illegal status of undocumented workers over a 13-year-period that includes payment of fines and other requirements. But it also mandates the border control improvements that Perdue said should be a priority – before any path to citizenship can take place. There is some truth in calling the Senate bill an amnesty measure, but just a grain. The bill also calls for much stiffer border control, and investment, first. Ignoring  those mandates pushes the claim down the the Truth-O-Meter. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/07/david-perdue/perdue-misses-mark-amnesty-allegation/

Dick Cheney says Army has just 4 combat-ready brigades
","There is no question that the Pentagon is spending millions of dollars in the effort to destroy the forces of the Islamic State group. By one estimate, fielding 2,000 troops in Iraq and maintaining a moderate level of airstrikes could cost between $200 million and $320 million per month. Former Vice President Dick Cheney warned that the military might not be up to the task that lies ahead. ""The threat is increasing, and our capacity to deal with it is decreasing,"" Cheney said Sept. 24 on Fox News’ Hannity. ""Because of what's happening to the U.S. military, the massive reductions in the budget, (and) the fact that we have four combat-ready brigades out of 40 in the U.S. Army."" The next day, Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, a former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell, said on MSNBC that Cheney’s figures weren’t correct. We decided to take a closer look at Cheney’s claim about the number of combat-ready brigades, largely because it can be difficult to quantify what qualifies as a ""massive"" budget cut. While you might think that a tally of combat-ready brigades is a simple number to find, it is not. The initial response we got from Army public affairs staff was, ""a unit's state of readiness is not publicly releasable information."" That said, in June, Col. Dan Williams, a senior planner for the Army’s Force Command, was interviewed on the status of a plan to increase the number of combat-ready brigades to seven by the end of the summer. ""The concept, as originally briefed, was implemented, and we’re already there, but we also expanded it,"" Williams told the Air Force Times. ""As funds have become available, we’ve been able to expand and get a more robust capability."" A member of the Army public affairs staff confirmed that at the time of that interview, the Army indeed had seven combat-ready brigades and that the situation had improved since then. ""Funding was restored, which allowed the Army to move away from budget prioritization and return to its normal readiness model,"" the spokesman said. The operational unit for the Army is a Brigade Combat Team, about 2,500 to 4,000 soldiers who bring a blend of fighting power and support functions that allow the brigade to operate on its own. For the Army, consistent training is a key piece of the puzzle to make sure that everyone in a team knows how to work together. In March 2013, sequestration -- the automatic budget cuts that kicked in when Congress failed to agree on a deficit reduction plan -- disrupted the Army’s training program.  But in December of that year, Congress gave the Pentagon sequestration relief, hiking its budget by more than $22 billion in fiscal year 2014 and more than $9 billion in 2015. In the words of an Army public affairs staffer, that move ""allowed the Army to buy back readiness. We haven't had to cancel any Combat Training Center rotations this year. So, readiness is stable."" There might be some wrinkles in this picture. In March, Army vice chief of staff Gen. John Campbell told the Senate Armed Services Committee that not every unit has had the time to do all the training the Army would like. Campbell said some teams come into the Combat Training Center ""at a low level of proficiency and cannot maximize this training event."" But that seems like a nuance that doesn’t detract from the conclusion that the Army has at least seven combat-ready brigades, and maybe more, available for contingencies. That means Cheney is off the mark in his claim. Definition of 'combat-ready' doesn't matter As we researched this claim, we came across the particular way the Army uses the term ""combat-ready."" Technically, ""combat-ready"" excludes brigades that are already deployed. That means that even more troops are likely trained and prepared to fight than Cheney is letting on. (Cheney didn't return our requests for comment.) ""If a unit is deployed, it's not ready,"" said Russell Rumbaugh, a senior associate at the Stimson Center, a think tank that focuses on broader defense issues. ""Including if it's in Korea staring down the North Korean Army. Many people would probably call that a ready brigade. But since its not available for deployment elsewhere, the Army doesn’t consider it ready."" The Army told PunditFact it has a total of 38 Combat Brigade Teams and of those, four are currently deployed.  Col. Leonard Wong, a research professor at the Army War College, said in a pragmatic sense, a brigade’s deployment status might not be so critical. ""The Army deployed brigades from Korea into Iraq, so I don't think that being forward-deployed means that the unit is not combat-ready,"" Wong said. ""Actually, it doesn't make sense for a forward-deployed unit to not be combat-ready. A unit needs the right type of equipment, leaders, personnel, and training to be combat-ready."" One final note: While Congress granted the defense department additional money, Army leaders express concern that readiness will suffer if new funds aren’t allocated in 2016 and beyond. Our ruling Cheney said that the Army has only four combat-ready brigades out of 40. While we don't have precise numbers, Army staff said there were seven combat-ready brigades in June, and that the situation has improved since then. Overall, there are 38 brigades not 40 as Cheney said. Making some allowance for shifting numbers, we rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/06/dick-cheney/cheney-army-has-just-4-combat-ready-brigades/
