Fact-checking John Oliver's interview with Edward Snowden about NSA surveillance
","Most Americans have a fuzzy understanding of exactly what the National Security Agency can and cannot see with its surveillance programs, much less what a former NSA contractor named Edward Snowden tried to do about it. That’s the finding, anyway, of informal street interviews by John Oliver’s crew at Last Week Tonight on HBO. Oliver devoted his April 5 show to the NSA spying story. It included an exclusive interview with Snowden, who is living in Russia after the State Department canceled his passport. And it included the topic of this fact-check: Can emails sent between two people living in the United States unwittingly end up on the computer screen of some NSA analyst? Oliver, who blends comedy with journalism, framed the discussion around the NSA peeping on nude pictures. Oliver asked Snowden to describe the capability of various NSA surveillance programs in relation to nude pictures sent by Americans, starting with ""702 surveillance."" This refers to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. This section was added in 2008 and was renewed under President Barack Obama in 2012. Could the NSA see a picture of, say, Oliver’s privates under this provision, he asked? ""Yes,"" Snowden said, ""the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which section 702 falls under, allows the bulk collection of internet communications that are one-end foreign."" After an Oliver joke about ""bulk collection,"" Snowden continued, ""So if you have your email somewhere like Gmail, hosted on a server overseas or transferred overseas or anytime crosses outside the borders of the United States, your junk ends up in the database."" Oliver jumped in and asked Snowden to clarify that the racy picture — if you’ve seen the interview, you know we’re paraphrasing — wouldn’t necessarily have to be sent to Germany in order to end up in NSA storage. ""No,"" Snowden said. ""Even if you sent it to someone within the United States, your wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the database."" Is it really true that this situation (regardless of the content of the email) could happen, and if so, is it likely? You’ve got mail … being collected by the NSA Several experts in national security law agreed Snowden’s scenario is plausible, thanks to holes in international surveillance laws that affect data shared between Americans living in America. The law that Oliver mentioned, Section 702 of FISA Amendments Act of 2008, is labeled ""Procedures For Targeting Certain Persons Outside The United States Other Than United States Persons."" Going on name alone, that sounds like the opposite of a license for the NSA to collect private messages between Americans. Not necessarily. The section addresses spying on communications on U.S. soil in which one end of the conversation is foreign. Critics, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Center for Technology and Democracy, and American Civil Liberties Union, deem it a ""backdoor search loophole"" that allows the NSA to get access to information on U.S. citizens. The section says the government cannot ""intentionally target"" citizens of the United States with its surveillance, nor can it target a person outside the country to learn more about the communications of a person who is in the United States. ""Intentionally,"" obviously, is a pretty big gap. NSA communications spying under Section 702 does not need an individual warrant. There are a few government spying programs that we know about, through Snowden’s leaks to journalists, that operate using Section 702, including Prism and Upstream. Prism, as outlined in a leaked slide, allows the NSA to collect via court order email, chats, videos, photos, stored data and files of foreign targets from technology companies such as Google, Apple, Yahoo, Microsoft and Facebook. Analysts reportedly use Prism in concert with Upstream, by which the NSA collects foreigners’ communications directly from the fiber-optic backbone of the Internet. A leaked NSA slide reported by the Washington Post describes Upstream as amassing ""communications on fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past."" Through those spying programs, it is possible that American-to-American email could hit an overseas server and be pulled into NSA databases even though those emails are not the target of NSA searches. The law does not prohibit this kind of ""incidental"" collection of Americans’ communications, as long as it was part of an otherwise valid collection of non-Americans’ information, said Stephen Vladeck, American University national security law professor. Government reports, leaks and a scathing 2011 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court opinion offer more proof that the NSA cannot separate out communications between Americans from the emails involving a foreigner. ""NSA’s knowing acquisition of tens of thousands of wholly domestic communications through its Upstream collection is a cause of concern for the court,"" wrote FISC Judge John D. Bates in the declassified opinion. It’s unknown exactly how often this happens, but it does not appear unusual. ""It doesn’t matter whether it’s a d--- pic or a bland email,"" said Andrew Crocker, a senior analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which sued the NSA to release the Bates opinion. ""These are all things that can be swept up."" By law, the NSA is supposed to ""minimize"" wholly domestic communications it obtains, said Molly Bishop Shadel, a University of Virginia law professor who represented the United States on terrorism-related matters before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court while working for the Justice Department. This could mean deleting the email or not searching or using the information, something Snowden doesn’t say. ""I can’t promise the email wouldn’t end up in an NSA database,"" she said, ""but it’s not going to be accessible to the government if it does."" Other experts pointed out that we don’t know for sure what happens to these exchanges when they are collected. Jonathan Mayer, a cybersecurity fellow at Stanford University’s Center for Internet and Society, said many important features of Upstream collection ""haven’t leaked and remain classified,"" such as whether it involves bulk collection, massive-but-targeted collection or only individually targeted collection, he said. Email routes that cross international boundaries So, yes, it’s possible that an email between you and your wife or husband about the grocery list could wind up in the hands of the NSA. But to do so, the electronic footprint of that email needs to leave the confines of the United States. How likely is that to happen? Understanding how or why an email may hit an overseas server even if it’s sent to someone in the same area requires a basic knowledge of how the Internet works. But even then, it’s complicated. So we turned to technologists, who had different opinions. Predicting how an email travels to its destination once you hit ""send"" is not an exact science — and it can change from hour to hour. When a person sends an email, it goes through the Internet service provider to an email provider, is exchanged with another provider, and goes back to someone else’s Internet service provider. If the Internet provider is big, like Verizon, the most efficient, least congested path to route the bits of information might just be a cable that crosses a foreign country’s boundary. Chats, pictures and messages travel from senders to recipients through the Internet along fiber-optic cables, some underground and some undersea. These cables can send messages in milliseconds. ""The way the network thinks about distance is very different from the way you think about distance in the real physical world,"" said Joseph Hall, Center for Democracy and Technology chief technologist. Hall mentioned an example using the concept of ""trombone routing:"" Two people could be on opposite sides of Denver, and the most efficient way to get bits of information to them may be through a cable that runs through Canada. Mayer, of Stanford University, suggested the odds are good that your message is stored domestically if you’re an American who is working within the continental United States and who is using Gmail. Mayer called Snowden’s example of an intimate picture shared between a couple in New York hitting a London server en route to its destination ""hypothetically possible, but it’s unlikely."" The route between providers would have to be unusual, and the connection would have to be unencrypted, he said. ""There are enormous privacy implications from the one-end foreign rule, to be clear,"" Mayer said. ""I just don’t think this is a very generalizable example."" On the other hand, Hall said, ""It’s not hard to see this happening at all,"" even though more providers are encrypting their networks in response to NSA practices. Even though Hall and Mayer have different estimations for how likely it is for a U.S. user’s communications to be transmitted over a national border at a given time, Hall agrees it’s more likely for an email to cross a border in places that don’t have a huge infrastructure.   Because Snowden mentioned Google’s Gmail service as an example, we checked in with the company to figure out under which conditions this example could happen. The company has strengthened the encryption of its infrastructure as a way to dissuade the government from using ""backdoor"" methods of tapping its network data without its knowledge. Emails between Gmail accounts are encrypted as they go to Gmail servers, which essentially means they look like gibberish to outsiders, and as they move from Google’s data centers around the country and the world. Copies of emails could be stored in several places, including in data centers abroad, as a way to provide backups in case one center fails. If the NSA tried to collect emails between Google data centers, they may be able to pull the metadata of messages (the to and from) but not the content. If one side of the exchange is not a Gmail user, the message may not be encrypted and therefore may be more vulnerable. As for how often an email may end up in a foreign server, even if it’s between two American Gmail users, spokesman Aaron Stein said, ""We aren't always able to predict how often that happens."" The NSA press office did not return requests for comment. Our ruling Snowden said, ""Even if you sent it to someone within the United States, your wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the database."" In Oliver’s context of a naked picture, the comment may be surprising. But to experts familiar with the laws governing surveillance practices and the NSA programs brought to light through his leaks, Snowden is correct that this could happen. But this isn’t the most likely scenario for most Americans emailing other Americans day-in, day-out. Moreover, the NSA is supposed to ""minimize"" domestic emails that get caught up in a broader sweep, either by deleting them or not searching or using the information. Snowden’s claim is accurate but misses that context. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/apr/09/edward-snowden/fact-checking-john-olivers-interview-edward-snowde/

Patrick Murphy supports GOP in most key votes, strategist writes
","Florida Democrats are drawing battle lines against one another now that U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy has declared he’s running for Senate in 2016. Following the second-term congressman’s announcement he’ll seek Republican Sen. Marco Rubio’s job, some liberals are saying Murphy is not the right candidate. They cite the Jupiter Democrat’s habit of breaking with his party on House votes. ""As a matter of fact, he’s sided with the GOP on key votes twice as often as he sided with Democrats,"" said Brook Hines, a marketing consultant for progressive campaigns, in a column on politics site TheFloridaSqueeze.com. Hines later says U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, whom she calls ""a bold progressive,"" would be a better candidate. Murphy was for many years a registered Republican before running for Congress in 2012, and he has a reputation for sometimes breaking with his party. But twice as much on so-called key votes? We decided to check the roll call to find out how Murphy really voted. Voting progressive Murphy has lived up to his moderate campaigns. He voted for a measure that would have made the president balance the budget by 2023 and backed a farm bill Democrats balked at because of work requirements for food stamp recipients. He also was one of only 19 Democrats to vote in favor of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline project. But measuring Murphy’s record comes down to how you look at the issues. Hines told us she used the website ProgressivePunch.org as her source, and there are some very specific guidelines to how she came up with her 2-to-1 comparison. First of all, the site has a group of 37 representatives that founder Joshua Grossman deems ""the progressive cohort."" These 37 are chosen using a complex formula, but basically we can consider them the most liberal members (people like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and New York’s Nydia Velázquez). There’s a smaller cohort for the Senate, too. Grossman’s site then compares a representative’s voting record to how this cohort voted to come up with what it calls ""crucial votes,"" which has a complicated definition: Any vote in which at least three-quarters of the 37 representatives voted against Republicans, while at least 10 percent of Democrats split from their party. That means votes where most liberals voted together and many moderates sided with the GOP. Using this data, the site comes up with a ""progressive score"" that shows the ratio of how an official compares with the most progressive members of Congress. In Murphy’s case, Hines took the progressive score for the 2015-16 Congress -- 31.25 percent (meaning that according to the site, he voted against progressive Democrats almost 69 percent of the time in the first three months of this year) -- to make her comparison. There are some problems with this comparison. The sample is small, because the 2015-16 score is comprised of only 17 votes so far, unlike the site’s lifetime score, which goes back to when Murphy took office. (His 45.71 percent lifetime score is a bit higher than just 2015-16.) And because the site’s record-keeping isn’t fully up-to-date, there’s no way to look up exactly which votes are part of the site’s calculation. Other examples There are other ways to look at Murphy’s voting record that show he doesn’t vote with Republicans twice as often. Both the Washington Post and the New York Times have tools that track major votes. In the Post’s sample, Murphy voted against his party in three out of eight key examples. The Times says he’s voted with Republicans two out of six times in major votes this year. GovTrack.us graphs Murphy as a centrist, but not nearly as far to the right as other Democrats. Ballotpedia.org concluded that Murphy outright voted with Republicans on three out of 13 issues. Perhaps most comprehensive is CQ’s ""party unity"" score, which measures how often Murphy voted with his party when a majority of Democrats voted the same way. His score for votes in 2014 is an 80, meaning he sided with Republicans about 20 percent of the time. That puts him about 12th from the bottom in terms of voting with his party, and the lowest among Florida’s delegation. For reference, the party average is about 90 percent; Minnesota Democrat Collin Peterson is dead last with a unity score of 48. Our ruling Hines said Murphy has ""sided with the GOP on key votes twice as often as he sided with Democrats."" That’s true by looking at one small subset of data gleaned through one progressive website that compared Murphy with a small group of liberals. Murphy does break ranks relatively often in a partisan Congress, but other outlets show Murphy sides with his own party, the Democrats, more often than not in notable votes. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/apr/09/brook-hines/patrick-murphy-supports-gop-most-key-votes-strateg/

Sean Hannity: You can't build a Christian church in Saudi Arabia
","If you’re looking for places that demonstrate religious tolerance, you probably should skip over Saudi Arabia. That was conservative talk show host Sean Hannity’s point as he talked with a caller on his radio program on April 8, 2015. ""You can’t build a Christian church in Saudi Arabia, did you know that?"" Hannity said. A reader didn’t know that, and asked us to look into Hannity’s claim. It checks out. Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told us that while many Muslim countries allow churches, and synagogues for that matter, Saudi Arabia is unique. ""I believe Saudi Arabia is the only Muslim country in which churches are prohibited,"" Hooper said. Akbar S. Ahmed is the chair of Islamic Studies at American University. He told PolitiFact in 2010 that there is nothing formalized in Islamic law that forbids the building of churches or synagogues. Saudi Arabia has a tradition of adopting the most restrictive interpretations of Islam. It is perhaps best known for its opposition to women driving cars. In 2008, representatives of the Vatican and Saudi Arabia held secret talks to clear the way for building a church in the Saudi kingdom. But the talks stalled. Christian bishops in Germany, Austria and Russia rebuked Saudi Arabia's top religious official in 2012 after reports that he issued a fatwa saying all churches on the Arabian Peninsula should be destroyed. According to Reuters, Saudi Arabia bans all non-Muslim houses of prayer. Christians there, typically foreign workers, pray in private homes. Our ruling Hannity said that Saudi Arabia doesn’t allow Christian churches. That’s correct. The Saudi Arabian government’s policy bans the construction of churches.

"['National', 'Debt', 'Rand Paul']","
Rand Paul: Debt doubled under Bush, tripled under Obama
","Both Republicans and Democrats share the blame for America’s increasing debt, said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., in a speech announcing his presidential campaign April 7. ""Big government and debt doubled under a Republican administration,"" Paul said. ""And it’s now tripling under Barack Obama’s watch."" Quite a few readers asked us if the debt has tripled since Obama took office in January 2009. We took a look at the numbers, and it hasn’t. It's increased about 1.7 times. However, Paul’s office said this isn’t the proper interpretation. Looking at the whole statement -- not just the second clause -- Paul wasn’t saying the debt has tripled under Obama alone. Instead, he was saying that it doubled under President George W. Bush. And since Obama took office, it has risen to a point that is triple what it was when Bush first took office. By this measure, Paul’s statement is closer to accurate. Let’s go through the numbers. Paul’s interpretation We used the Treasury Department’s Debt to the Penny clock, which is a daily log of federal debt going back about 20 years. The debt held by the public and gross federal debt (which includes debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings) are both considered appropriate measurements. But we only have data that goes back far enough for the gross federal debt, so we’re going to stick with that measure. When Bush’s term started Jan. 20, 2001, the gross federal debt was $5.73 trillion. At the end of his term, Jan. 20, 2009, the gross federal debt was $10.63 trillion. This means that the debt just about doubled under Bush. The gross federal debt under Obama -- as of April 7, 2015 -- is $18.15 trillion. So, the debt is a little more than triple what the debt was when Bush took office in 2001, $5.63 trillion. Pinning the debt A lot of factors contribute to the debt other than the policies of the current president. By talking about debt growth spanning both a Republican and Democratic administration, Paul sidesteps this issue somewhat, but we wanted to provide some extra context. For example, the debt has increased so dramatically in Obama’s term -- particularly in the first couple years -- largely due to the recession, which unfolded before Obama took office, said Neil Buchanan, an expert in law, economics and the national debt at George Washington University Law School. ""The gross debt increase in 2009 was huge, because of the decreased tax revenues and increased benefit payments caused by the Great Recession,"" he said. Two other large contributors to debt since 2009 are the government’s continued borrowing to fund military operations in the Middle East and increasing costs of the health system, said Linda Bilmes, an expert in national budgetary issues at Harvard University. Both of these were a result of previous administrative policies and external factors. Bilmes noted, though, that Obama has decided to continue the military operations (increasing the debt) and attempted to slow the growing costs of health care through the Affordable Care Act (lowering it). Additionally, measuring the debt in raw dollars does not reflect inflation or the fact that a larger economy can handle a larger amount of debt. A better measurement would be the debt burden, or how the debt compares to the gross domestic product, Buchanan said. During the Bush administration, debt as a percentage of GDP went from about 55 percent to about 68 percent. As of 2014, it’s shot up to 103.2 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center. Our ruling Paul said, ""Debt doubled"" under Bush ""and now it’s tripling under Barack Obama’s watch."" This statement is confusing. A person could easily interpret it to mean that debt has tripled since Obama took office -- which would be incorrect. Paul, on the other hand, said that it means debt today, under Obama, is triple what it was when Bush’s term started.  Indeed, today’s national debt is about triple what it was in January 2001, when Bush took office.  It's also worth noting that many factors other than a particular president's policies affect the national debt. From one not-so-obvious angle, Paul's numbers are correct. But because the statement could so easily be interpreted in another, less accurate way, we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/apr/09/rand-paul/rand-paul-debt-has-tripled-bush-took-office/

Obama: Iran spends $30 billion on defense; U.S. about $600 billion
","As President Barack Obama tries to win support for a nuclear deal with Iran, one of his arguments is that this strategy of negotiation comes with minimal risk. In an interview with the New York Times, Obama made the point that America is and will remain much more powerful than Iran. ""Iran’s defense budget is $30 billion. Our defense budget is closer to $600 billion,"" Obama said. ""Iran understands that they cannot fight us."" As part of the promise we made during our Kickstarter campaign, we gave a reader the chance to pick from a list of possible claims, and the reader asked us to look into Obama’s comparison of the Iranian and U.S. military budgets. We asked the White House for the source of the president’s statement. The press office staff was checking but as of the time we published, we had not heard back. Iran Iran has about 500,000 people in its military, including many conscripts with limited training and some elite forces. According to the U.S. Defense Department’s annual review of Iran, ""Iran’s military doctrine is defensive. It is designed to deter an attack, survive an initial strike, retaliate against an aggressor, and force a diplomatic solution to hostilities while avoiding any concessions that challenge its core interests."" A summary from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan analytic branch of Congress, says ""Iran lacks the logistical ability to deploy its own ground forces across waterways such as the Persian Gulf, but Iran is able to project power throughout the region by recruiting, advising, and arming Shiite fighters from around the region as a force multiplier."" The reports adds that Iran ""is developing increasingly lethal systems such as more advanced naval mines, submarines, coastal defense and anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles, and attack craft."" We found several estimates of Iran’s military spending. The Congressional Research Service said the country spends about 3 percent of its GDP, which translates into about $11 billion. Reuters reported that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani plans to spend 282 trillion rials on defense. At the current exchange rate, that equals about $10 billion. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute database has a similar figure. Long-time Middle East analyst Anthony Cordesman with the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote that after accounting for Iran’s support for its defense industry, the money it spends on Shiite paramilitary groups in other countries, and its nuclear program, the total could reach $14 billion. The highest estimate we found came from the Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation, a Washington think tank and advocacy group. It put Iran’s total spending at $17.7 billion in 2013. U.S. military spending Most of the military budget falls under the Defense Department. The actual total includes portions of the country’s nuclear program at the Energy Department and defense-related spending in other departments. For the Defense Department alone, the Congressional Budget Office’s summary of the budget bill passed last December shows $520 billion in outlays with another $64 billion (good for two years) to cover overseas contingency operations, such as fighting the Islamic State group. That yields a total of $584 billion. Laicie Heeley is policy director at the Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation. By Heeley’s tally, after you add in $19 billion for nuclear weapons and $7.5 billion in other departments, the total comes to $621 billion. For fiscal year 2016, the president is requesting nearly $612 billion. ""It's hovered around the $600 billion for the past two years and hit almost $700 billion in FY12,"" Heeley said. Our ruling Obama said that ""Iran’s defense budget is $30 billion. Our defense budget is closer to $600 billion."" The highest estimate we found for Iran’s total defense spending was $18 billion. That is significantly less than Obama said, although if anything, it supports his argument more than the number he used. Obama gave himself some wiggle room on American defense spending. It is actually a bit higher than $600 billion but his phrasing is pretty close. With the caveat that Obama overstated Iran’s military spending, we rate the claim Mostly True. Note: This claim was fact-checked as part of a reward to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union.

Bernie Sanders says half of Americans have less than $10,000 in their savings accounts
","U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, speaking in Austin, bemoaned widening income differences between the country’s very rich and the rest of us. And in his remarks at a South Austin union hall, the Vermont independent mulling a run for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination also warned about American failures to save money. ""Here’s something not talked about, something that can make us all very, very nervous,"" Sanders said. ""Half of all Americans have less than $10,000 in their savings account. ""And you know what that means and you know why people are so stressed out? If you have less than $10,000,"" he said, ""that means an automobile accident, a divorce, a serious illness, a crisis of one kind or another can drive you into bankruptcy and financial disaster."" Is he right that half of us have less than $10K in savings? Sanders’ backup To our inquiry, a Sanders spokesman, Jeff Franks, said by email that Sanders relied on an April 2014 USA Today news story quoting a survey indicating 52 percent of U.S. workers had said they had less than $10,000 in total savings and investments, such as a 401(k) or IRA, that could be used for retirement. It did not include their homes or defined benefit plans, such as traditional pensions that could be used for retirement Specifically, the story said, 36 percent of workers said they had less than $1,000 in such savings and investments with another 16 percent of workers reporting $1,000 to $9,999 in such savings and investments. Those results came from a telephone survey of 1,000 workers and 501 retirees by the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute and Greenwald and Associates. Next, we spotted a chart on the institute’s website drawn from the same 2014 Retirement Confidence Survey. The 52 percent of workers reporting less than $10,000 in savings and investments in 2014 is up from 39 percent in 2009, the chart shows. 
Of course, ""workers"" isn’t all of us. We called the Washington, D.C.-based institute, which says it was founded in 1978 to deliver unbiased information on employee benefit plans ""so that decisions affecting the system may be made based on verifiable facts."" By phone, researcher Craig Copeland told us that overall, 51 percent of survey respondents, meaning retirees and others, had less than $10,000 in financial savings. Also by phone, Ruth Helman of Greenwald and Associates, which helped do the survey, paused at the senator’s wording. ""Strictly speaking, ‘their savings account’ isn’t correct. It’s total savings wherever it may be, under the mattress or wherever,"" Helman said. Federal Reserve Bank We wondered if there were other ways of looking at savings. Several experts urged us to contact the Federal Reserve Bank, which conducts a survey focused on consumer finances every three years. Its latest survey, drawing on data collected in 2013, resulted in a chart pointed out by Copeland indicating that the median value of financial savings outside of a pension or home reported by the nearly 95 percent of families who had bank accounts or stocks, bonds and other financial assets that year was $21,200, down from $23,000 in the board’s 2010 survey. SOURCE: Report, ""Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2010 to 2013: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,"" Federal Reserve Bulletin, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 2014 Copeland said that given that more than 5 percent of families reported no such financial assets, it’s reasonable to speculate that families overall had median financial savings of less than $20,000. We also asked reserve board officials to analyze the senator’s ""savings accounts"" statement. By phone, William Emmons and Bryan Noeth, both employed by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, raised questions. For instance, why not count a family’s home or pension as part of its savings?  Reminder: The institute, with its focus on savings for retirement, set aside these asset categories. Emmons said: ""People do count on their housing equity, not only in retirement, but before that."" Beyond that, the pair said, it’s not always meaningful to focus on money held in ""savings accounts,"" which are a single wealth indicator. ""A savings account isn’t where everybody holds their money,"" Noeth said. The two said a potentially superior way to gauge how Americans are faring, savings-wise, would be to consider net worth meaning family assets compared to debts. An agency manager, Adriene Dempsey, emailed us a spreadsheet showing that according to the board’s 2013 survey, 26 percent of U.S. families had less than $10,000 in net worth--a tick worse than the 25 percent of families according to its 2010 study. In 2013, half of American families had about $81,500 in net wealth or more, according to the spreadsheet. Total assets for a family include financial assets, such as bank accounts, mutual funds and securities plus tangible assets, including real estate, vehicles and durable goods, according to a February 2015 essay by the St. Louis Fed. We’ve elaborated on this here. So by the net-worth metric, more families are better off than if one focused on financial savings alone. We ran this ""net worth"" angle past the institute’s Coleman, who reminded by email that its survey (relied on by Sanders) took into account financial assets, not just savings accounts. Our ruling Sanders said: ""Half of all Americans have less than $10,000 in their savings account."" Some clarification went missing here: A 2014 survey indicated about half of American adults had less than $10,000 in savings and investments, such as a 401(k) or IRA, that could be used for retirement; those results encompassed more than savings accounts.

SunTrust bank closed Brooksville shop's accounts for selling guns, website says
","A bank suddenly closing checking accounts for a Brooksville pawn shop that sells guns has opened up Internet speculation that the Obama administration influenced the decision. Under the headline ""Suntrust Bank Cancels Account Because Company Sells Guns,"" the website FloridaNewsFlash.com recounts how American Gun & Pawn owner Steve Champion received a letter from SunTrust dated March 20, 2015, telling him his deposit accounts, safe deposit boxes and credit cards would be closed. (A reader first alerted us to the story after seeing it on Facebook.) The letter said that after an account review, American Gun & Pawn’s accounts were no longer jibing with SunTrust’s ""corporate business objectives."" There were no specifics in the letter, beyond information that he had a month to close his accounts or they would be closed for him. When Champion contacted the bank, he said a service rep told him he had received ""one of those gun letters going around to the gun and pawn shops."" The bank wouldn’t reverse the decision. Champion posted the letter on his shop’s Facebook page, kicking off a flurry of conspiracy theories that SunTrust and other banks were working at the behest of the Obama administration, which was trying to stamp out gun sales nationwide. FloridaNewsFlash.com, apparently first to report the news online, stoked the fire by saying it was part of an ominous program from the Obama administration called ""Operation Choke Point."" Many other sites have followed suit. SunTrust told us they didn’t close American Gun & Pawn’s accounts because the shop sold guns. As we dug into the details, we found that the bank was ending its relationship with some types of customers, but those customers weren't specifically gun shops.  Bank policy SunTrust denied they are closing accounts with gun shops, but they are ending relationships with pawn shops. ""Any suggestion that this is a firearms issue is inaccurate,"" spokesman Michael McCoy told us. SunTrust announced in a Aug. 8, 2014, press release that the bank had ""decided to discontinue banking relationships with three types of businesses – specifically payday lenders, pawn shops and dedicated check-cashers – due to compliance requirements."" The bank still works with firearms dealers, according to the release. It takes a little guesswork to determine just why SunTrust has stopped dealing with all pawn shops. There’s no specific regulation saying the bank can’t work with them, and SunTrust would only reiterate to us that they had adopted the policy. And we did find other cases of SunTrust dropping pawn shops in other parts of the country. We’re not going to weigh in on whether or not it’s fair for banks to deny accounts to pawn shops or payday lenders, although Champion said it was an unfair end to two decades of banking. ""I’ve heard about stuff like this,"" he told PolitFact Florida. ""But it doesn’t matter either way, whether I’m a pawn shop or a gun shop, because I’m a legal business. This is not right."" Choke Point FloridaNewsFlash.com writer Samuel McCall didn’t want to comment on the record about Champion’s story, but said he reported it the way Champion told it to him. McCall’s report tied the SunTrust letter to the aforementioned Operation Choke Point. The U.S. Justice Department started Operation Choke Point in 2012 as a way to stop banking fraud. The operation specifically investigated banks’ relationships with ""third-party payment processors"" -- the payment services that online stores often rely upon -- to determine if they were defrauding consumers. Gun rights advocates drew a connection between gun dealers and Choke Point from 2011 guidelines from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. that identified so-called ""high-risk"" businesses that commonly use third-party payment processors. The guidelines warned merchants who used these services had higher than normal potential for committing fraud. The FDIC list included pawn shops, payday lenders, pornography and yes, firearms and ammunition dealers. (The list also included telemarketers, fireworks sellers, dating services and coin dealers, among others.) This list led to a firestorm of criticism that the government was attempting to shut down legal businesses through Choke Point, eventually resulting in an investigation by the House Oversight Committee. A report from chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., concluded in May 2014 that the FDIC list had become a sort of hit list of businesses for Choke Point to target. The Justice Department denied the charge, saying none of their cases involved legal businesses like gun dealers or porn, and the FDIC removed the list in July 2014. Justice Department spokesman Patrick Rodenbush told us the three fraud cases that stemmed from Choke Point involved banks.  ""In no case has the department targeted any lawful enterprise, such as gun or ammunition sellers,"" he said. But the American Banking Association told us it was likely banks had been influenced by federal guidelines in some fashion, though it had no specific information about which ones or why. The FDIC addressed banking concerns with a letter in January 2015 urging banks to evaluate customers ""on a case-by-case basis"" instead of denying service to entire categories of businesses out of fear of not complying with federal law. In any case, the backlash against the program continues, with groups like the U.S. Consumer Coalition running a website allowing people to share their stories of businesses allegedly being affected by Choke Point. Brian Wise, senior adviser for the group, contends Choke Point has one purpose the government won’t admit: ""To go after businesses they couldn’t legislate out of existence for the last two decades."" Our ruling FloridaNewsFlash.com said, ""Suntrust Bank Cancels Account Because Company Sells Guns."" Actually, the bank decided recently to end relationships with pawn shops, payday lenders and check cashers, but it will still work with firearms dealers. The FDIC has warned banks to examine relationships with customers that use third-party payment processors, because of the risk of consumer fraud, and a federal program called Operation Choke Point has investigated the same issue. Gun rights advocates have argued that Operation Choke Point is a backdoor way of targeting gun shops, but the government denies there’s any such plan to target gun dealers, and no one has been able to truly prove otherwise. Overall, we rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/apr/08/florida-news-flash/suntrust-bank-closed-brooksville-shops-accounts-se/

Meme on Facebook says Ted Cruz declared 'no place' for gays, atheists in 'my America'
","Here we go again: A reader just pointed out a Facebook meme suggesting Texan Ted Cruz declared America constitutionally off limits to gays and atheists last month when he declared his candidacy for president. We recently found Pants on Fire a Facebook post saying the Canada-born Cruz, the Republican U.S. senator who announced his presidential candidacy at Liberty University in Virginia, had conveniently flip-flopped on each president needing to be born in the United States. Did not happen. The ‘no place’ Facebook post Now let’s turn to the Facebook post brought to our attention most recently:  SOURCE: Facebook post, March 25, 2015 (noted by a PolitiFact reader April 2, 2015) The image had a tagline mentioning a Facebook page titled ""Stop the World, The Teabaggers Want Off."" Off we clicked, learning that Facebook page includes this disclaimer about its posts: ""This page is for entertainment purposes. It is NOT meant to be taken seriously. It is primarily satire and parody with a mix of political memes and messages."" The afternoon we scrolled the page, we didn’t spot the Cruz meme. But the image and purported Cruz statement had been sent out by the group in this March 25, 2015, tweet:  SOURCE: Twitter post, @StopTeabaggers, March 25, 2015 No confirmation in news stories The image did not put the statement in quotation marks. Still, the meme as a whole struck us as leaving the impression that Cruz said it. And it doesn’t look like he did. In fact, online searches and a check of the Nexis news database yielded no evidence Cruz, a Houston lawyer elected to the Senate in 2012, has ever made a comment about the Constitution leaving no place for gays or atheists in his America. To our inquiry about the presented quotation, Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler said by email it’s ""obviously false."" Cruz’s speech declaring for president Next, we scrutinized a Washington Post transcript of Cruz’s March 23, 2015 speech declaring for president. In the speech, Cruz mentioned marriage once, gays and atheists not at all. On marriage, he said: ""Instead of a federal government that works to undermine our values, imagine a federal government that works to defend the sanctity of human life and to uphold the sacrament of marriage."" Cruz didn’t mention atheists, but he emphasized religious faith before students at the university founded by the late Jerry Falwell, an evangelist. For instance, Cruz referred to ""the God-given liberty of every American."" He also said: ""God’s blessing has been on America from the very beginning of this nation, and I believe God isn’t done with America yet."" He closed: ""I am honored to stand with each and every one of you courageous conservatives as we come together to reclaim the promise of America, to reclaim the mandate, the hope and opportunity for our children and our children’s children. We stand together for liberty. ""This is our fight. The answer will not come from Washington. It will come only from the men and women across this country, from men and women, from people of faith, from lovers of liberty, from people who respect the Constitution. ""It will only come as it has come at every other time of challenge in this country, when the American people stand together and say we will get back to the principles that have made this country great. We will get back and restore that shining city on a hill that is the United States of America."" Other Cruz comments Finally, we looked into whether the meme’s quotations reflected on past Cruz comments. Cruz has repeatedly said he doesn’t want gay marriages to be legal, as the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans, spells out in its ""Republican Facts"" web page titled: ""Ted Cruz: Not a Fan of Pride Parades."" In March 2012, Cruz was quoted by Peggy Fikac of the San Antonio Express-News saying: ""I believe that engaging in homosexual conduct is a choice, and I do not believe that unelected judges should force states to adopt gay marriage, against the wishes of the people. Marriage is a fundamental building block of our society, and I have a proven record of standing and fighting to protect traditional marriage between one man and one woman."" Cruz also has stressed his religious faith; he’s a Baptist, Tyler told us. And in spring 2014, Cruz made a public jab about atheists, as recapped April 2, 2014, by the National Journal. Mentioning an Air Force chaplain ordered by his supervisor to take down a religious blog post he'd written, deeming it insensitive to atheists, Cruz said: ""I sort of thought the job of a chaplain is to be insensitive to atheists."" By telephone, Danielle Muscato of American Atheists, which says it’s a ""nonprofit, nonpolitical, educational organization dedicated to the complete and absolute separation of state and church,"" told us she couldn’t confirm Cruz making the ""my America"" claim. Our ruling A Facebook post suggests Cruz said the day he declared for president, ""There is no place for gays or atheists in my America. None. Our Constitution makes that clear."" Cruz has been clear about his belief in God and opposition to legalizing gay marriages. However, there is no record of him saying the Constitution leaves no place for gays or atheists in ""my America."" Pants on Fire!

70% of Americans don't have college degree, Rick Santorum says
","Rick Santorum, a potential candidate for president in 2016, argues that the Republican Party is not offering enough for America’s workers. The former senator from Pennsylvania said Republicans need to improve in reaching out to these voters on CBS’s Face the Nation on April 5, 2015. ""I think people are looking for someone to bring us together. And I put a book out last year called Blue Collar Conservatives, and it's the whole idea that we have to start bringing those who are being left behind by this economy. We have to give them an opportunity to be able to reach that American dream again. And I think Republicans, frankly, have been very weak on that,"" Santorum said. After mentioning that Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, did not do a great job in reaching out to the working class, Santorum added: ""I think there's a lot of folks who are very disenchanted with both political parties because neither party is really talking about them and really saying what's the way forward for the 70 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree but, you know, want economic opportunity like everybody else and nobody's talking about that."" We wondered whether Santorum is correct that 70 percent of Americans don’t have a college degree. We checked with Santorum’s staff of his organization Patriot Voices, and they sent us an article from Vox about Scott Walker’s lack of a college diploma. The reporter argues that not having a college degree does not really matter since ""most Americans — nearly 70 percent — don't have a bachelor's degree, either."" The article doesn’t give a source for its number. We decided to look for data about educational attainment from the U.S. Census Bureau; we found 2014 data (the most recent available) on the U.S. population by age, race and gender. We focused on the age group of 25 years and over, because most American students graduate by the time they turn 25. According to census data, 209.3 million people in the United States are 25 years old or older, and 66.9 million have a bachelor’s degree or higher (such as a master’s, professional or doctoral degree). That means about 68 percent of them do not have a bachelor’s degree.  If we include people who have an academic associate degree -- about 11.7 million people -- the percentage of people without a degree declines slightly, to 62 percent. The U.S. Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics looked at the same question in a 2014 longitudinal study that followed young people to age 27. It found that by that age, 72 percent of respondents did not have bachelor's degrees.  Our ruling  In making the point that Republicans need to reach out to the working class more, Santorum said that 70 percent of Americans don’t have a college degree. We found several measures that are close to the number Santorum cited. Overall, we rate his claim True. Correction, Apr. 14, 2015: We rated this statement True, but due to a production error, we initially published our fact-check with a logo that mistakenly indicated that we had rated it Mostly True. We have fixed that logo. In addition, we have updated the math from our original version to include people who have a higher degree above a bachelor’s. The new data doesn’t change the rating, which remains True. ",/factchecks/2015/apr/08/rick-santorum/70-americans-dont-have-college-degree-rick-santoru/
"['Water', 'Texas', 'Sid Miller']","
Sid Miller says, 'We have towns in West Texas that are out of water'
","At a March 2015 symposium on water in Texas, the state’s agriculture commissioner was asked about his agency’s actions in that realm. Sid Miller, a former legislator who took office in January 2015, replied that just that week he’d signed off on water wells being drilled in two West Texas communities with less than 180-day water supplies. Miller, a Republican, continued: ""We have towns in West Texas that are out of water, that are having to truck in water."" We were familiar with occasional past shortages. But is that happening again? When we requested Miller’s backup information, Agriculture Department spokesman Bryan Black sent us web links to news reports. One was a January 2012 NPR news report on Spicewood Beach, a Burnet County town northwest of Austin, having to truck in water. Then again, conditions there were expected to rebound, according to a June 2013 Austin American-Statesman news story, thanks to new water wells drilled near Lake Travis and a new water treatment plant. Black also pointed out a June 2013 Texas Tribune news story on the West Texas town of Barnhart, which was then out of water. To gauge Barnhart’s conditions of late, we reached John Nanny, an Irion County commissioner who serves on the board of the Barnhart Water Supply Corp. By phone, Nanny said drinking water last had to be trucked in during July and August 2014 — at quite a cost, he said. ""We can’t afford to do that,"" he said, adding that a second well was dug, helping to shore up supplies to about 50 customers. Black didn’t specify communities that had no water when Miller, um, piped up. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Next, we reached out to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. By email, spokesman Terry Clawson said that as of March 12, 2015, the agency wasn’t aware of any public water systems hauling in water. That said, Clawson wrote, the Berry Oaks Water Company in Comal County, between Austin and San Antonio, intermittently hauls water because of summer shortfalls. Clawson emailed us a chart indicating the water system is building a well and water plant, to be up and running, Clawson said, by mid-May 2015. Clawson said the chart represents the agency’s weekly updated High Priority Water System List, which reflects water-supply conditions self-reported to the commission — meaning it shouldn’t  be read as all-inclusive. ""There may be systems that have either not reported their status or are not aware of their conditions,"" Clawson said. In a follow-up note, Clawson specified 11 public water systems previously reported as having to haul (or truck) in drinking water due to persistent drought. He attached a chart describing each instance. In another email, Black mentioned most of the same systems. The commission chart listed five water systems located somewhere on the vast west side of Texas, specifically ones in Burnet County, northwest of Austin; Barnhart in Irion County, west of San Angelo; Medina County, west of San Antonio; Hood County, southwest of Fort Worth; and Tom Green County, whose county seat is San Angelo. Then again, in each event, according to the chart, the Texas Department of Agriculture or the water system itself funded improvements restoring supply. Our ruling Miller said: ""We have towns in West Texas that are out of water."" In recent years, towns around Texas occasionally ran dry until new wells or water plants met needs. But Miller named no towns out of water of late nor did we identify any. We rate the statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Attack ad says Rand Paul supports Obama on Iran negotiations
","On the same day Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., announced his intention to run for president, a political action committee released an ad attacking him for his foreign policy views, claiming that Paul sides with President Barack Obama on Iran. ""The Senate is considering tough new sanctions on Iran,"" the ad’s narrator says. ""President Obama says he’ll veto them, and Rand Paul is standing with him. Rand Paul supports Obama’s negotiations with Iran, and he doesn’t understand the threat."" The TV ad comes from the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America, a Republican political action committee, and will run nationwide. The United States and several other world powers reached an agreement with Iran in late March, expected to set in motion a final deal curbing Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons, with a June 30 deadline. In a speech officially announcing his 2016 presidential campaign, Paul distanced himself from President Barack Obama’s position on Iran. ""Successful negotiations with untrustworthy adversaries are only achieved from a position of strength,"" Paul said April 7. ""The difference between President Obama and myself, he seems to think you can negotiate from a position of weakness."" We wanted to know if Paul really does support the ongoing negotiations. We found that, in short, while Paul supports the idea of negotiating with Iran -- as opposed to say, military action -- it’s misleading to equate his position to Obama’s. The current negotiations Paul’s staff and the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America pointed us to the same interview to support their respective sides -- a March 11 interview with NBC’s Matt Lauer. On the one hand, in the interview, Paul critiqued Obama’s current position. He said Congress should be able to review and approve a deal, which might force a tougher agreement. ""In doing so, maybe the president will negotiate a more appropriate deal where we actually get Iran to give up their nuclear ambitions,"" Paul said. On the other hand, Paul said he is ""one of the senators who's in favor of negotiations with Iran. I want there to be a peaceful outcome, but I want to strengthen the president's hand."" Paul has expressed support for negotiations instead of military action for keeping Iran from getting nuclear weapons for a while now. ""I want the outcome to be one that's not war,"" he said on Fox News in 2013. ""I think we've had quite a bit of war in the last decade. I would like to have an outcome where Iran agrees not to have nuclear weapons, but at the same time we have that without having a war."" (David Weigel of Bloomberg compiled a timeline of Paul’s Iran positions.) The spokeswoman for the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America, Lisa Booth, noted that Paul hasn’t pushed for the new sanctions that some Republicans have promoted. Obama has said he would veto any such bill because of the possibility that it could derail negotiations. At a January Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Paul seemed to align with Obama on this point. ""As we move forward, I've been one who says new sanctions in the middle of negotiations is a huge mistake and may well break up the sanctions coalition, may well drive Iran away from the table,"" he said. But the fact that Paul and Obama have similar views on this particular point does not mean that Paul supports Obama’s negotiations with Iran as a whole. Another segment from Paul’s remarks at the hearing better outlines his position -- that he’ll wait and see before passing judgment on the substance of the deal, but also that he wants Congress to have some say. ""There's several of us on this side who do not blanketly (sic) say, no, we will not vote to approve an agreement,"" he said. ""But we want (the White House) to know that (members of Congress) have the right to vote to it, so you come talk to us."" The fact that Paul believes any deal needs to go through Congress is a pretty big difference between his and Obama’s positions. Paul recently signed the letter from 47 Republican senators to Iranian leaders informing them that Congress or a future president could scrap any deal reached this year. It’s hard to argue that a senator who signed that letter supports Obama’s policies, considering the administration and Democrats loudly criticized the letter, saying it was counterproductive to the negotiations. Additionally, Paul is a cosponsor of pending legislation that would require Congress to review any deal with Iran -- legislation opposed by the White House. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the bill, if passed, ""could potentially interfere with the ongoing negotiations."" ""To say that Sen. Paul supports the administration's ‘go at it alone’ effort with the negotiations in Iran is a blatant distortion of his record,"" said Paul spokeswoman Eleanor May, adding that Paul has ""consistently attacked"" Obama for executive overreach and ""weak and inconsistent foreign policy."" Paul hasn’t been especially vocal about his views on the outcome of the most recent negotiations, concluded at the end of March. In fact, his first statement came just on April 6 -- and it shows neither outright support nor criticism. ""We don't know the details of the deal yet,"" Doug Stafford, a spokesman for Paul's PAC, told Bloomberg’s Weigel. ""Sen. Paul will be watching closely and believes any deal must make clear Iran cannot acquire a nuclear weapon, allows for full verification and is approved by Congress. He voted for sanctions both times they were put before Congress and believes only Congress should remove those sanctions."" While this isn’t germane to the specific claim we’re checking, we wanted to give some context to a Paul quote included in the ad. The ad has audio of Paul saying, ""It’s ridiculous to think that (Iran is) a threat to our national security."" This quote came from a 2007 interview with right-wing radio host Alex Jones, where he spoke out against military hawks that he said were interested in invading Iran. Needless to say, Paul has changed up his rhetoric on this point in the last eight years. In 2013, he said the possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons was ""the most pressing issue of the day."" Our ruling An ad attacking Paul said, ""Rand Paul supports Obama's negotiations with Iran."" The nugget of truth here is that Paul has expressed support for the idea of negotiating with Iran. Additionally, he has not outwardly critiqued nor praised the substance of the Obama administration’s ongoing negotiations. However, Paul believes Congress should play a role in approving any deal, a notable difference from Obama’s position. Paul differs from some other Republicans who unequivocally oppose the ongoing negotiations, but this difference isn’t enough to say he supports Obama. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/apr/07/foundation-secure-and-prosperous-america/attack-ad-says-rand-paul-supports-obama-iran-negot/
"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Gov. Rick Scott shifts again on Medicaid expansion
","Has Gov. Rick Scott changed his mind on Medicaid again? In 2012, Scott said he was against expansion. In 2013 he said he was for it. Now, he says he’s against it. Or does he? PolitiFact Florida decided to put Scott’s position on expanding Medicaid on our Flip-O-Meter, to document whether he has changed position. Let’s follow Scott’s path over the past few years. The starting point Medicaid is the longstanding federal and state health insurance program for the very poor; traditionally people also have to be elderly, disabled, pregnant or a child to qualify. The Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, sought to expand that program to anyone making up to about 133 percent of the poverty level.  (The original plan was that every state would expand the program, but a 2012 Supreme Court decision allowed each state to decide for itself.) Before he ran for governor in 2010, Scott was a persistent critic of President Barack Obama’s federal health care law. In 2009, Scott spent $5 million of his own money to form Conservatives for Patients' Rights and oppose the law. For much of his first term, Scott said that Florida would not expand Medicaid, because it ""just doesn’t make any sense"" and that it was too costly. We should note that Washington offers more generous cost-sharing for states that expand Medicaid. It covers 100 percent of the cost of newly eligible people  through 2016, 95 percent in 2017, 94 percent in 2018, 93 percent in 2019, and 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. Those numbers are set by statute, so it would take new legislation from Congress to change those terms. First flip On Feb. 20, 2013, now sitting in the governor’s office, Scott announced a change of position, declaring unequivocally that he supported expanding Medicaid. He called it a ""compassionate, common-sense step forward."" While the federal government is committed to paying 100 percent of the cost of new people in Medicaid, I cannot, in good conscience, deny the uninsured access to care.  We will support a three-year expansion of our Medicaid program under the new health care law, as long as the federal government meets their commitment to pay 100 percent of the cost during this time.  Legislation we would support would sunset after three years and need to be reauthorized. It would also sunset if the federal government backed away from their 100 percent commitment during this period. Scott’s announcement won headlines across the country. But the Florida Legislature had other ideas. It never approved the expansion. We should note, however, that Scott never really pushed for the expansion. And he didn’t promote expansion during the 2014 campaign for governor against Charlie Crist, who said repeatedly he supported the federal law and would work for Medicaid expansion.  Back flip? The Florida Legislature has been grappling with Medicaid expansion during its 2015 legislative session. The House of Representatives is opposed; while the Senate seems more open. On April 6, Scott rattled the understanding of his position on Medicaid when he seemed to come out against expansion in comments he made about the state’s money troubles with a separate federal health care program called the Low-Income Pool. The LIP, as it’s known, started in 2006. It’s a Medicaid pilot project that distributes $2.2 billion to hospitals to cover the cost of treating low-income, uninsured and underinsured patients. The federal government provides about half the money. The program was set to expire in 2014, but the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) agreed to extend it until June 30, 2015. A CMS spokesman told PolitiFact, ""The one-year LIP extension has allowed the state to engage in a process of critical planning to address the need for a more sustainable Medicaid financing system."" The spokesman said CMS has no plans to extend the LIP program in its ""current form."" Scott viewed this a sign that Washington is an unreliable partner. Here's the full text of his statement: ""Our priority is to cut more than $600 million in taxes this session and get K-12 education funding up to record levels while holding the line on college tuition. We still have several weeks left for budget negotiations; however, given that the federal government said they would not fund the federal LIP program to the level it is funded today, it would be hard to understand how the state could take on even more federal programs that CMS (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services) could scale back or walk away from."" Many people took that to mean Scott had backed away from Medicaid expansion. The next day, reporters pressed Scott to clarify whether this meant he no longer supports expanding Medicaid. Scott declined to answer directly. ""I like the program we have right now,"" Scott said. We asked Scott’s office if he still wants expanded Medicaid. As of our deadline, we have not heard back. Our ruling In 2013, Scott said in no uncertain terms that ""we will support an expansion of our Medicaid program under the new health care law."" In 2015, Scott suggested the state should not expand Medicaid, saying it would be ""hard to understand how the state could take on even more federal programs."" Scott’s change of position on expanding Medicaid is particularly perplexing because it comes at a time when the Florida Senate seems to be genuinely considering legislation to either expand the program or propose some kind of overhaul to the program. His April 6 statement dumps cold water on that effort. That’s a dramatic about-face from supporting expansion. We rate this a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2015/apr/07/rick-scott/scott-shifts-again-medicaid-expansion/

Pete Gallego, re-seeking seat, says Will Hurd quit House panel saying he couldn't find time for it
","Democrat Pete Gallego, who lost his U.S. House seat to Republican Will Hurd in 2014, seeks a 2016 rematch. A reason for voters to change sides, Gallego said in an April 2, 2015, email blast, is that Hurd evidently doesn’t have time to fulfill his duties. ""Just two weeks ago, Congressman Hurd quit his post on the House Committee on Small Business saying that he was unable to find the time to serve,"" Gallego said. We were curious about Gallego’s charge. Is freshman Hurd short of time? Resignation letter Gallego’s campaign spokesman, Anthony Gutierrez, responded to us by email by pointing out a March 2015 entry in the Congressional Record showing that Hurd, a former CIA officer, asked to be removed from the committee in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner. Hurd’s letter, dated March 16, 2015, said: ""I write today to resign from the House Small Business Committee. While I appreciate the honor of being appointed, in order to best serve the constituent of Texas' 23rd Congressional District, I believe I must focus on my existing committee assignments. ""With my background in the intelligence community cybersecurity, and representing the district with the largest length of U.S.-Mexico Border, my ability to focus on my Information Technology Subcommittee Chairmanship and Border and Maritime Subcommittee Vice-Chairmanship is where I believe I can be of most value to my constituents and colleagues in the House. ""I appreciate your timely consideration of this request."" According to the CR entry, the Texan’s resignation was accepted the same day. Hurd's committee assignments We looked next into Hurd's workload. His House website says Hurd serves on the House Homeland Security Committee; he’s vice chair of its Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee and also serves on its Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee. Hurd also serves on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for which he chairs its Information Technology subcommittee; his appointment to the chairmanship was described as a plum prize in a February 2015 San Antonio Express-News news story pointed out to us by Shana Teehan, Hurd’s communications director. Hurd also serves on the oversight panel’s National Security Subcommittee. An online search led us to a web page created by the House clerk, dated Feb. 10, 2015, listing each member’s committee assignments. That list showed Hurd as a member of the small business panel plus the two others. Counting Hurd, six Texas members of the House were assigned to three committees each; the other 30 Texans had one or two assignments. And as of April 7, 2015, Hurd was still listed as a member of all three panels on another House clerk’s web page. (Previously, Gallego was a member of two committees.) Hurd campaign elaborates By phone, Hurd campaign spokesman Josh Robinson said Hurd initially learned of his appointment to the small business panel from a committee-issued press release. The panel’s Jan. 21, 2015, announcement listed Hurd among 14 committee members. According to the committee's calendar, the panel subsequently met three times before Hurd resigned. Hurd appreciated the appointment, Robinson told us, but given his other assignments and desire to travel back and forth to the vast 23rd Congressional District, he decided ""being in another committee meeting in D.C. was not going to be helpful."" Hurd, Robinson said, would rather focus on small businesses in his district than ""listen to a bunch of bureaucrats"" in hearings. Chairman Chabot: 'Procedural glitch' By email, Teehan provided a statement she described as obtained by Hurd’s office about March 18, 2015, from Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, who chairs the small business panel. Chabot, praising Hurd’s energy and enthusiasm, is quoted saying that even though ""a procedural glitch means it is necessary to change his committee assignments, I know he’ll be a dedicated voice for working Americans across his district."" Teehan also emailed Rep. Lamar Smith’s description of Hurd’s appointment to the small business panel as ""a small administrative matter that has now been corrected."" Smith, R-San Antonio, serves on the House Republican Steering Committee, which Teehan described as responsible for Republican committee assignments. Glitch? Administrative error? We left messages for aides to Chabot and Smith seeking elaboration while wondering how this might pertain to Hurd’s departure from the committee. We didn’t hear back. Next, we filled in Gallego’s adviser, Gutierrez, who pointed out by email that House committee assignments, including Hurd’s appointment to the small business committee, were entered into the Congressional Record on Jan. 13, 2015--eight days before the mentioned press release came out and about two months before Hurd submitted his letter to leave the committee. Our ruling Gallego said Hurd recently ""quit his post on the House Committee on Small Business saying that he was unable to find the time to serve."" Hurd, who separately had two other committee assignments, quit the small-business panel stressing his desire to focus on security-related subcommittee assignments. Gallego’s statement, leaving the impression Hurd said he lacked time to serve, left out important details. We rate his claim Half True.

Claim misleads on handshake between Trump and Trudeau
","A picture is worth a thousand words, the saying goes, but sometimes sussing out the truth on social media requires a series of photos. A Feb. 20 photo posted on Facebook — that shows former President Donald Trump staring at Justin Trudeau’s outstretched hand with a grimace — suggests that Trump was refusing to shake hands with the Canadian leader. A text overlay reads, ""Trump knew,"" and the caption says, ""One of my favorite photos of all time! Gotta love Trump."" The post was shared by Ryan Fournier, founder and co-chairman of Students for Trump. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo is real, but it was taken a second before the two leaders shook hands. Video and still photos of the 2018 meeting show the entirety of the encounter, including the handshake. The encounter occurred when Trump and Trudeau were attending the Group of Seven summit in Quebec in June 2018. In this video of their meeting, at the 4-second mark, Trump quickly looked at Trudeau’s outstretched hand. Then at the 5-second mark, the two shook hands. Many people commenting on the Facebook post believed that Trump had actually rebuffed Trudeau, and that he did so because he is a good judge of character. ""It's amazing that Trump could spot a Tyrant before before such Tyrant even showed his true colors --- truely amazing,"" one person wrote.  Another said, ""I love that. He knows evil when he sees it."" In recent weeks, Trudeau’s political opponents have called him a dictator because he invoked Canada’s Emergencies Act to deal with blockades by people protesting COVID-19 restrictions and mandates. When Trump was in office, it was not uncommon for him to look uncomfortable when shaking hands with world leaders, as was documented in a 2019 USA Today photo gallery titled ""President Donald Trump: Awkward handshakes with world leaders."" Trump is a self-described ""germaphobe"" and has called shaking hands ""barbaric."" But he did shake hands with Trudeau.

No, Ottawa didn’t threaten to punish protesters by killing their pets
","Did Ottawa authorities really threaten to kill the pets of truckers to punish them for protesting Canada’s vaccine mandates? That’s what some on social media were saying after a tweet by Ottawa By-law & Regulatory Services on Feb. 17, a day before police started moving in to clear the downtown area of protesters who had been camped out on city streets for more than three weeks. But that’s a distortion of the tweet, which warned protesters who brought their pets along to the demonstration that the city may have to take their animals into ""protective custody"" should the owners be arrested. ""SHOCK POLICY: Ottawa may euthanize truckers’ pets as punishment,"" read a Feb. 20 Facebook post. It’s a screenshot of a headline from the website The Counter Signal, a website that describes itself as helping ""conservatives to fight back and share the news that Justin Trudeau would prefer to cover up.""  Underneath that headline in the Facebook post is a photoshopped image of Dr. Anthony Fauci supposedly saying, ""You stole that from me!"" (That's a reference to another claim we already tackled here.) The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s why the post is misleading. By-law and Regulatory Services is a city law-enforcement agency that handles non-criminal issues, such as nuisances, business licensing and traffic. On Feb. 17, the agency’s Twitter account, @OttawaBylaw, tweeted out a warning to protesters who brought pets with them that if protesters are jailed, their pets will be ""placed into protective custody for 8 days."" If arrangements aren’t made after that, the tweet said, ""your animal will be considered relinquished.""  The Animal Care and Control By-law provides for temporary “protective care” by the City of animals in the event that the owner is not available, under circumstances including eviction, incarceration, or fire or medical emergency. https://t.co/Pf1Irf70al We don’t know how many protesters brought their pets along with them, but only one pet was placed in custody, officials said. On Feb. 21, the Ottawa Police Department reported 196 arrests of protesters. Ottawa police and the Children’s Aid Society of Ottawa made similar statements to protesters, urging them to arrange care for their children should parents be sent to jail. Jennifer Therkelsen, acting director of By-law and Regulatory Services, said that Ottawa’s Animal Care and Control By-law (2003-77) allows officers to take animals whose owners cannot care for them ""as a result of incarceration, fire, medical emergency or eviction"" into ""protective custody."" ""This authority is applicable citywide and intended to ensure the animals’ safety and well-being, including the provision of basic needs, while their owner is unavailable to do so,"" she said.  The bylaw declares the Ottawa Humane Society as the ""operator of the pound.""  ""When the city places an animal in protective care, the owner has eight days to make arrangements for their animal,"" said Stephen Smith, a spokesperson for the Ottawa Humane Society. Arrangements can be made by phone or the owner can have someone make them on their behalf. If that doesn’t happen, the organization assumes ownership and assesses the animal for adoption, Smith added. ""We received one animal as a result of arrests at the protest, and the animal was returned to its owner the same day,"" said Smith. The organization’s euthanasia policy reads that it ""keeps every adoptable animal until the right home is found, regardless of length of stay."" ""Humane euthanasia"" may be necessary when an animal is suffering incurably, is considered dangerous to the public or ""professionally assessed as not suitable for adoption, either medically and/or behaviourally, using a best-practices protocol,"" the policy says. The organization’s most recent annual report covering 18 months in 2020-21 said it took in 2,585 animals, reunited 690 of them with their owners, adopted out 1,278 and transferred 73 to other shelters. The shelter had a live release rate of 79.4% of animals taken in, the report said. There were 674 animals euthanized — 39% of those at their owners’ request, 51% due to serious medical issues and 10% due to serious behavioral issues such as aggression and/or extreme fear, the report said. A Facebook post said that the city of Ottawa may euthanize the pets of protesters as punishment for participating in the recent truckers’ protest against vaccine mandates. The city did not threaten to kill any pets ""as punishment."" Ottawa By-law & Regulatory Services did tweet a warning that if protesters were incarcerated, the city would place their pets in protective care for up to eight days. If no arrangements were made to retrieve the animals by then, the pets would be considered ""relinquished,"" it said. Animals taken into the city’s custody are brought to the Ottawa Humane Society, which says it euthanizes animals only if they have serious medical or behavioral issues, the organization’s website said. Only one animal from the protest was brought to the shelter and it was returned to its owner, the shelter said. While it is possible that any animal brought into the shelter may meet the agency’s euthanasia criteria, the shelter’s numbers show such situations are rare.

JD Vance says transgender rights drives looming conflict in Ukraine
","As the prospect of a ground war hangs over Ukraine, Ohio Senate hopeful J.D. Vance said he doesn’t ""really care what happens to Ukraine, one way or the other."" Speaking to former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, Vance, a Marine veteran, said there’s no reason for U.S. military intervention. ""We didn't not serve in the Marine Corps to go and fight Vladimir Putin because he didn't believe in transgender rights,"" Vance said Feb. 19. ""Which is what the U.S. State Department is saying is a major problem with Russia."" Vance went on to say he is ""sick of Joe Biden focusing"" on Ukraine at the expense of dealing with problems on the border with Mexico. Whatever the troubles on America’s southern border, Russia’s transgender policies are not affecting the current tensions in Ukraine. The U.S. and its NATO allies estimate that since last spring, Russia has moved as many as 150,000 troops within striking distance of Ukraine’s borders.  ""That is by any means, by any estimate, a massive number of forces,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said Feb. 16. ""We also know that the Russians have capabilities when it comes to electronic warfare, when it comes to aerial capabilities, any number of tactics they could employ, whether on their own or together as part of a broader onslaught."" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said a Russian attack could come at any moment, if Russia wanted. ""They have enough troops and enough capabilities to launch a full fledged invasion of Ukraine with very little or no warning time,"" Stoltenberg said Feb. 17. ""That is what makes the situation so dangerous."" President Joe Biden has said the warnings of war are aimed at forestalling it. ""We’re calling out Russia’s plans loudly and repeatedly, not because we want a conflict, but because we’re doing everything in our power to remove any reason that Russia may give to justify invading Ukraine and prevent them from moving,"" Biden said Feb. 18. Europe hasn’t seen sustained warfare on its turf since the breakup of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, and that didn’t involve the prospect of Russian forces driving combat operations. With Ukraine, the potential scale of a military conflict is orders of magnitude bigger. Russian President Vladimir Putin has clearly said that Ukraine’s future relations with NATO present a prime concern for the national security of Russia. One of his key demands is that NATO promise never to allow Ukraine to join the western alliance. NATO members have rejected that demand. Vance opposes overseas military engagements, and he casts this as an optional activity for the U.S. But that doesn’t mean Biden is focused on this because he wants to protect transgender rights. Attacks on transgender people are one item in a very long list of concerns the State Department cited in its 2020 human rights report on Russia. The report’s first concern, however, is Russia’s ""occupation and purported annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula."" Then the report gets into ""extrajudicial killings and attempted extrajudicial killings, including of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons in Chechnya by local government authorities; enforced disappearances; pervasive torture by government law enforcement officers,"" and the list goes on. In another section, the report underscores the poisoning of Putin’s political opponents, like Alexei Navalny. The Vance campaign pointed to a State Department fact sheet on Russia’s Top 5 Persistent Disinformation Narratives. The list included the Russian theme ""that Western civilization is collapsing and has strayed from ‘traditional values’ because it works to ensure the safety and equality of LGBTQI+ people and promotes concepts such as female equality and multiculturalism."" Russia might be invoking that message, but that says nothing about the U.S. motivations to get Russia to back down over Ukraine. The human rights report is just one way the U.S. assesses other countries. The intelligence community has its own version in its annual threat assessment. Russia figures prominently in the 2021 installment.  It devotes an entire section to Russia, saying, ""Moscow will continue to employ a variety of tactics this year meant to undermine U.S. influence, develop new international norms and partnerships, divide Western countries and weaken Western alliances, and demonstrate Russia’s ability to shape global events as a major player in a new multipolar international order."" It makes no mention of transgender policy. Vance said that Biden risks war with Russia because Putin doesn’t ""believe in transgender rights."" There is a risk of war, but it is due to Russia’s focus on Ukraine’s ties to the west and the buildup of Russian forces along Ukraine’s border. The State Department noted the threats against transgender people as one issue among many in a report on human rights. It gave much more space to the danger posed by Russia’s military policies in its most recent annual threat assessment. The risk of war in Ukraine is not affected by Putin’s attitude toward transgender rights.

Russian spokesman’s statement ignores centuries of Russian attacks
","As Russia’s military was surrounding Ukraine and threatening to invade, Russian president Vladimir Putin’s spokesman gave an interview in which he denied that Russia had ever invaded any other country. ""We remind you that Russia has never attacked anyone throughout its history,"" Dmitry Peskov said in an interview on the Russia-1 television channel, according to the Russian news service TASS. ""And Russia, which has survived so many wars, is the last country in Europe that even wants to utter the word ‘war.’"" When asked about this assertion, historians agreed that Peskov’s statement was untrue. ""It’s blatantly false,"" said David Silbey, a military historian at Cornell University. ""How do you think the Russian Empire acquired most of its territory?"" said Dan Nexon, a professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University.  Faith Hillis, a historian at the University of Chicago, agreed that the statement is ""baseless,"" and yet ""also very familiar, because it was repeated frequently in Soviet-era textbooks. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Russia attacked and subjugated numerous populations, almost always with the rationale that the aggression was mandated by Russians' needs to protect themselves or others."" The Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Here is a list of examples, stretching over more than 450 years, of Russia or the Soviet Union going on the offensive militarily, excluding cases of direct self-defense. We’ve left off the list murkier examples of Russia attacking as part of formal alliances, such as the events that precipitated World War I.  Siege of Narva during the Livonian War, 1558, shown in a depiction made in 1836. (Public domain) • The Livonian War. In 1558, Tsar Ivan IV of Russia (sometimes called Ivan the Terrible) invaded Livonia, an area that included much of modern-day Estonia. This precipitated three decades of war that involved Russia, Poland, Lithuania, and Sweden. • The Great Northern War. In 1700, Russia, under Tsar Peter I (known as Peter the Great) joined with its allies in challenging the regional hegemony of Sweden. At the outset of the 20-year war, Russian troops laid siege to the Estonian city of Narva. • The annexation of Crimea. During the 1770s, the Black Sea region of Crimea had nominal independence but with Russian control of key ports. Empress Catherine II (known as Catherine the Great) refused mediation offered by other European powers and eventually took control of the entire peninsula. Russia formally annexed Crimea in 1783. • The partition of Poland. In 1791, Poland enacted a new, liberal constitution. Conservative elements known as the Confederation of Targowica asked Russia to intervene and reimpose the previous constitution. Russia agreed and eventually ended up absorbing Lithuanian Belorussia and western Ukraine. A Russian hospital in Sebastopol during the Crimean War, 1855. (Public domain) • The Crimean War. The war, which stretched from 1853 to 1856, stemmed from a great powers conflict in the Middle East involving Russia, Great Britain, France, and the Ottoman Empire. Russia demanded protections for Orthodox populations subject to Ottoman rule. In 1853, at the outset of the war, Russia occupied portions of modern Romania along its border with Turkey. Russian troops were involved in multiple campaigns in the early days of the Soviet Union in the 1920s, but historians say the chronology and circumstances are too muddled to be included on this list. Later examples are clearer, however, they said. Soviet cavalry on parade in Lviv, after the city's surrender to the Red Army during the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland. (Public domain) • The invasion of Poland. On the eve of World War II, Russia and Germany signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, a nonaggression agreement between Hitler and Stalin that enabled the two powers to carve up and occupy Poland. The two dictators carried out their dual invasions of Poland in September 1939. • The Russo-Finnish War. In November 1939, shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Soviet Union sought to expand its reach to portions of Finland. The Finnish government rejected a Soviet proposal to control several islands and secure a lease for a naval facility in exchange for a portion of Soviet territory. The Soviets proceeded to attack, and after more than three months of combat, the two sides signed a treaty favorable to the USSR in March 1940. • The Soviet takeover of the Baltics. In 1940, the Soviet Union presented ultimatums to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, requiring them to admit an unlimited number of Soviet troops and install pro-Soviet governments. All three countries refused, and the Soviet Union proceeded to take control of the countries. Puppet governments agreed to be absorbed into the Soviet Union. • War against Japan. In the closing days of World War II, the Soviet Union jettisoned its neutrality pact with Japan and invaded Japanese-held Manchuria from the east, west and north, as well as landing on Japanese-held Sakhalin Island.  • The Invasion of Hungary. A revolutionary moment occurred in 1956 in Soviet-aligned Hungary, amid some easing following the death of Josef Stalin. In November 1956, the Soviets invaded and crushed the efforts to liberalize, including executing former premier Imre Nagy.  Czechoslovaks carry their national flag past a burning tank in Prague during the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.

(AP) Some of Russia’s military campaigns in the post-Soviet era don’t make this list for technical reasons. (Russian military activity in Chechnya, for instance, was arguably an internal matter.) However, in 2014, Russia took control of Crimea from Ukraine, and later formally annexed the region. The annexation was never accepted by most other nations.  Experts said that Peskov’s framing leans heavily on the idea that a military attack is not an attack as long as there is some justification, however tenuous or archaic. ""Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union both have expansionary histories, but in Russian history-writing, these expansions are ‘liberations,’ not hostile annexations or attacks,"" said Susanne Wengle, a University of Notre Dame political scientist.   Typically, Russia, as well as other states, claim to have ""intervened"" on behalf of the ""good guys,"" or were invited in by a government, or reacted to an attack by another state, Herrera said. ""This is how Russia would explain its previous wars.""  While the uncertainties of history sometimes allow justifications for attacks on other countries to be somewhat plausible, the more important point for the current situation, Herrera said, is that ""the statement by Peskov is part of Russian propaganda to make it seem like Russia is not the aggressor today."" ""What is different about 2022,"" Herrera said, ""is that Russia is engaging in astonishingly belligerent and dangerous action on the border with Ukraine, and an invasion would be a clear choice by Russia to ‘attack’ unprovoked, with little question of who is the attacker, in comparison to other, more complicated historical examples."" Peskov said, ""Russia has never attacked anyone throughout its history."" Historians cite upwards of a dozen examples dating back to the 1500s in which Russia or the Soviet Union attacked another country without being militarily attacked first.  Russia may offer various justifications for why it attacked another country in these instances, but contrary to Peskov’s statement, each of these examples did involve militarily unprovoked actions by Russia or the Soviet Union.

In Durham filing, Scott exaggerates proof of Clinton campaign spying on Trump
","Former President Donald Trump regularly claimed that the Obama administration spied on him during the 2016 presidential election. Now, Republicans and conservative media are saying that it was Hillary Clinton’s campaign that did the spying.  Their evidence? A new filing in an ongoing federal probe by special counsel John Durham.  For Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott, the Durham material is a smoking gun. ""The latest with the Durham report is that the Clinton campaign, the same group that fear-mongered this Russian collusion, actually spied on the president of the United States,"" Scott said Feb. 15. Many commentators have embellished what’s in this latest information, and Scott’s statement also treats some fuzzy elements as if they were solid proof. Durham’s filing doesn’t say the Clinton campaign spied on Trump, nor does it say that the data referenced in the filing came from the time when he was president.  We’ll unpack the details. In October 2020, Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, appointed Durham to investigate how and why during the 2016 election the Justice Department decided to probe possible links between Trump and Russia. One of two people indicted as part of Durham’s probe is Michael Sussmann, an attorney for a law firm that represented Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.  In 2015, Sussmann was separately retained by another client, a technology executive, according to Sussmann’s September 2021 indictment. News reporting later revealed that executive to be Rodney Joffe. Joffe worked with a team of cybersecurity researchers who had access to internet traffic data under a pending contract with the federal government to monitor for security threats and breaches. They thought that some data they were analyzing may have amounted to potential evidence of a communications channel between the Trump Organization and a Russian bank.   The data they were parsing was domain name system, or DNS, data, which essentially tracks every time a computer or smartphone connected with a web server on the internet. It does not reveal the content of a person’s screen or messages. The indictment Durham secured against Sussmann charged him with making a false statement when he brought this information to the FBI during a 2016 meeting. Durham alleges that Sussmann told the FBI he was not there ""for any client"" when, the indictment says, he was actually acting on behalf of both Joffe and the Clinton campaign.  Sussmann has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. Joffe has not been charged with any criminal activity in the matter. Neither have Clinton or other campaign officials.  Durham’s Feb. 11 filing at the center of the most recent coverage built out the case against Sussmann, adding some details about a second meeting Sussmann had with the CIA in February 2017. The meeting had been referenced in the original indictment and was the subject of previous reporting.  At that meeting, Sussmann relayed that Joffe and researchers had developed other suspicions while sifting through the internet traffic data. Their concern was that the data showed Russian-made phones were being used from networks serving Trump Tower and the White House, among other locations. Joffe’s firm at the time had legal access to the data because it was providing services for the White House. There is no question that Sussmann worked for Clinton’s 2016 campaign for president. But he says that when he met with the FBI, the information he passed along was not on behalf of the campaign. He also said he didn’t make any false statements about whom he represented. Durham’s filing says he billed the campaign, but Sussman’s lawyers say that he couldn’t have represented the Clinton campaign because by the time of Sussman’s February meeting with the CIA, the campaign no longer existed. Sussmann presented information to government officials based on internet traffic data that came from the White House executive offices, Trump Tower and other places.  But several points remain murky. Durham’s filing does not say that the DNS data was captured after Trump took office. The filing says that on Feb. 9, 2017, Sussmann ""provided an updated set of allegations"" to the CIA, and the indictment says the DNS data he shared ranged ""from 2016 through early 2017.""  The filing doesn’t make clear whether any of that data came after Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017. Sussman’s lawyers have argued that it did not. His attorneys and those representing one of the researchers who worked with Joffe have said that none of their information was gathered after Trump took office. Sussmann told congressional investigators, under oath, that the second meeting took place in February because it was delayed, not because he had collected new data. He said he first reached out to the CIA in December 2016, while Barack Obama was still president, but that ""it took a while to have a meeting, and so it ended up being after the change in administration."" Durham’s filing also doesn’t say that the DNS data was collected illegally. He writes that the technology company had access to data from the Executive Office of the President and  ""exploited this arrangement by mining the EOP’s DNS traffic and other data for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about Donald Trump.""  Scott's office cited this line, among others from the Feb. 11 filing, in response to PolitiFact's inquiry. Ric Simmons, a law professor at the Ohio State University, said that’s not the same as saying anyone broke privacy laws. ""The tech company had legal access to these servers and there is no indication that they were not allowed to share the information,"" Simmons said. A spokesperson for Joffe’s company said in a statement to ABC News that Trump wasn’t the reason they were scanning DNS data. ""As a result of the hacks of the Executive Office of the President and the Democratic National Committee servers in 2015 and 2016, respectively, there were serious and legitimate national security concerns about Russian attempts to infiltrate the 2016 election,"" the statement said. ""Upon identifying DNS queries from Russian-made Yota phones in proximity to the Trump campaign and the EOP, respected cybersecurity researchers were deeply concerned about the anomalies they found in the data and prepared a report of their findings, which was subsequently shared with the CIA."" The legal process might produce more details, but at this point, Durham has not said using the data was a crime. By itself, this undercuts the notion that anyone spied on Trump. And if the target was Russian meddling, as Joffe’s statement said, and not Trump, there’s even less basis to cast this as spying. Finally, Durham’s filing didn’t say that campaign officials directed this activity. Sussmann worked both for a law firm that represented the campaign, and for Joffe, who had lawful access to the data. Simmons said Scott’s statement ""implies that the decision-makers of the Clinton campaign knew about this or directed these actions, and the filings make no mention of such a link."" ""There’s no evidence suggesting any of this was elaborately masterminded by Hillary Clinton,"" said Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the Libertarian Cato Institute, in a Twitter thread. ""The rather tenuous Clinton link is that Joffe passed the researchers’ findings on to FBI & CIA via Sussman, a prominent cybersecurity lawyer who’d also done work for the Clinton campaign."" Simmons also noted that nothing has been proven. ""Nobody ‘hacked’ or ‘intercepted’ anything,"" Sanchez said. Scott said ""the latest with the Durham report is that the Clinton campaign … actually spied on the president of the United States."" The filing from Durham is more tentative than Scott presents. It states that an attorney for an internet company that was collecting data related to White House communications from 2016 to early 2017 also served as an attorney for the Clinton campaign. It does not say that the Clinton campaign directed these activities. And it does not assert that the data was gathered illegally or that it was collected while Trump was president.

Cornyn right that annual drug overdose deaths top 100,000
","Days after the U.S. reached 900,000 total COVID-19 deaths, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, highlighted another morbid statistic. He tweeted on Feb. 14, ""We recently found out our nation hit a grim milestone: 100,000 Americans died of an overdose in a single year."" He also linked this statistic to President Joe Biden's border policy and wrote, ""Pres. Biden’s open borders policies are letting drugs like Fentanyl pour into our communities. This cannot go on - we must secure the border."" Is it true that 100,000 Americans died of overdose ""in a single year""? PolitiFact Texas took a look. Cornyn's office pointed to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Nov. 17 news release and a Feb. 13 article by The New York Times citing that November release.  The National Center for Health Statistics estimated there were more than 100,300 drug overdose deaths nationally in a 12-month period ending April 2021. That matches what Cornyn said. Compared to the same period the year prior, drug overdose deaths had increased 28.5%. Data released Feb. 16 indicate an estimated 104,288 Americans died from drug overdoses from September 2020 to September 2021, according to CDC media relations. Marcia Ory, Texas A&M University School of Public Health professor and co-chair of Texas A&M's Opioid Task Force, believes that number may be an undercount. Ory said she sees that to be the case in Texas' rural counties. ""Texas has very few medical examiners in all of our 254 counties, so we already know that it's often a justice of the peace or someone who's not medically trained,"" Ory said. ""Because of that the symptoms of an overdose death might be interpreted as cardiac failure, respiratory problems."" According to 2019 posts by the Texas Medical Association, only 15 of Texas' 254 counties have populations large enough to have a medical examiner's office. Cornyn's tweet included a video of his remarks in the Feb. 14 Senate session, where he described how opioid overdose deaths are driving drug overdose deaths and how the drug overdose death rate changed from 2018 to 2020. Scott Walters— professor at the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth and a leader in a National Institutes of Health-backed initiative to stem the opioid crisis — said Cornyn's characterization of overdose deaths decreasing in 2018, increasing in 2019, and skyrocketing in 2020 was right. ""Cornyn's right that in 2018 we had seen a slow decrease, slow slide, of drug overdose deaths. That's absolutely true. But coinciding with the start of the pandemic, we saw a sharp increase in the number of overdose deaths,"" Walters said. When it comes to drug overdose deaths, the driver of the increase is opioid use. The CDC press release indicated deaths from opioids increased by 35% from the one-year period ending in April 2020 to the one ending in April 2021.  Cornyn specifically emphasized fentanyl use. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that, even in small amounts, can be lethal. The Department of Justice describes fentanyl ""practically and effectively 50 and 100 times more potent than heroin or prescription opioids"" on its public awareness webpage on opioids. Cornyn wrote in his tweet, ""Pres. Biden’s open borders policies are letting drugs like Fentanyl pour into our communities. This cannot go on - we must secure the border."" Cornyn said he believed Customs and Border Protection agents' focus on an influx of migrants has detracted from drug interdiction efforts. It's important to note, however, that the one-year period cited by Cornyn's office started during Donald Trump's presidency and ended roughly three months after Biden took office. U.S. Customs and Border Protection in South Texas saw a 1,066% increase in fentanyl seized in fiscal year 2021, according to a January press release from the agency. Mexico and China were the primary source for fentanyl trafficked into the U.S. in 2019, according to a 2020 report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. ""Starting with the beginning of the pandemic and the lockdown, what happened was that the normal — the so-called normal — supply routes for heroin were all pinched. It was just plain more difficult to get heroin anymore,"" Walters said. So people started to shift during the pandemic, Walters said. ""You saw a shift from heroin and prescription pill-based products to more synthetic products. Synthetic opioids like fentanyl,"" Walters said. ""That's responsible for the increase."" Jane Maxwell, a University of Texas professor who monitors drug use patterns in Texas, said there is not a lot of data available on users, despite fentanyl's link to many recent drug overdose deaths. While Cornyn pointed to Biden's border policy as part of the problem, Walters said he isn't sure ""open borders"" is the problem. Walters noted people have been moving substances across the border for years, and fentanyl is smaller and easier to conceal. Walters said he believes drug awareness campaigns need to be rethought. Well-established public health education tactics, like for public education on the dangers of smoking, assume people have a long time to use drugs before something terrible happens. That long period of time allows more opportunities to cut down or quit. ""With fentanyl, lethal doses are much smaller. It's a lot more like a poison in circulation. And we ought to be thinking more about a poison control solution rather than a stereotypical drug use campaign,"" Walters said. Cornyn tweeted on Feb. 14, ""We recently found out our nation hit a grim milestone: 100,000 Americans died of an overdose in a single year."" While Cornyn did not specify which year in the tweet, the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support this.

No, JFK did not plan to end the Federal Reserve
","The theory that President John F. Kennedy was planning to end the Federal Reserve has been around for decades, but it is not supported by evidence.  The claim persists on Facebook, where a recent video was captioned: ""JOHN F KENNEDY WAS PLANNING TO END THE FEDERAL RESERVE.""  In the video, a man appears to be speaking in front of a backdrop of a still photo of former President Donald Trump and his wife Melania, walking in a parade on Inauguration Day 2017. A small moving rhinoceros has been added to the page. The audio narration is a voice-over, and the words don’t match up with what the man on the screen appears to be saying.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The claim that Kennedy was planning to end the Federal Reserve, a central bank that has independence and influence over monetary policy, has been the subject of various online postings and a book, so we wanted to see whether there was any truth to it.  Economic and government experts, a report from the Congressional Research Service, and Kennedy’s public statements all disprove the claim.  The theory goes like this: Kennedy signed Executive Order 11110, transferring power from the Federal Reserve to the U.S. Treasury by replacing Federal Reserve notes with ""United States Notes,"" according to an explanation in New York Magazine. ""The government, such theorists contend, printed a small fortune (over $4 billion) in ‘Kennedy bills’ before his assassination. Just days afterward, ‘all of the money President Kennedy had created was destroyed, and not a word was said to the American people.’""  Ira Stoll, the author of a book about Kennedy’s economic policies, ""JFK, Conservative,"" told PolitiFact that in his research, he found no evidence that Kennedy was planning to end the Federal Reserve. What Kennedy would think of the Federal Reserve now is hard to know, because it changed under President Richard Nixon, when the dollar was de-linked from gold, Stoll said. Kennedy’s assassination makes people theorize about what he would have done, he said.    While Kennedy and the Federal Reserve clashed, there is no evidence that he ever proposed getting rid of it, said Nicholas F. Jacobs, an assistant professor of government at Colby College, who has written about economics in the Kennedy era.  ""In fact, all evidence points to the idea that the Federal Reserve System was a necessary component of Kennedy’s larger economic plan,"" Jacobs said.  In 1962, Kennedy supported legislation to reorganize the terms of the Federal Reserve, so that the chair and the vice chair are appointed when the president begins their term of office, Jacobs said. The proposal would have taken effect in 1965. ""Importantly, the proposed legislation would first take place after Kennedy’s first term would have ended, so it was not an attempt to cajole existing members,"" Jacobs said. The terms of the chair and vice chair were staggered then, as they are now, in such a way to prevent a president from having undue influence over Fed leadership. When a new president is sworn in, they deal with the Federal Reserve’s existing leadership.  The Congressional Research Service in 1996 debunked common myths about the Federal Reserve, including a theory from author Jim Marrs that Kennedy’s purported desire to rein in the Federal Reserve somehow led to his assassination.  The theory is supposedly supported by Executive Order 11110, which proponents say was intended to strip the Federal Reserve of its power. In reality, if anything, the executive order enhanced the Fed’s power. Kennedy’s Executive Order 11110 and related legislation decreased the circulation of Silver Certificates, with Federal Reserve Notes taking their place, the CRS said. Kennedy made the change due to the rising cost of silver and increased economic activity, which created a need for more small-denomination currency. In two speeches just before his 1960 election, Kennedy said he was committed to keeping the Federal Reserve.  ""I do not, let me make clear, advocate any changes in the constitution of the Federal Reserve System. It is important to keep the day-to-day operations of the Federal Reserve removed from political pressures,"" he said in New York City in October 1960. He said something similar that same month in Philadelphia.  A Facebook post said Kennedy ""was planning to end the Federal Reserve."" Experts said that there is no evidence to support this claim. The Congressional Research Service, more than 30 years after Kennedy’s death, said that an executive order that proponents of this claim hold up as evidence actually does the opposite of what they suggest.  Kennedy’s pre-election speeches also indicate he did not intend to eliminate the central bank.

Rep. Wilhour says no ""observational or clinical data"" exists proving benefits of masks in schools
","Several states across the nation are announcing the end of mask mandates for most public places. But in some states, the debate continues over the need for masks in schools.  Downstate Illinois Republican lawmakers earlier this month criticized Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s decision to exclude schools from his plan to end indoor mask mandates for most public places by the end of the month.  GOP state Rep. Blaine Wilhour of downstate Beecher City joined state Sen. Darren Bailey of Xenia, who is running for governor, and state Rep. Adam Niemerg of Dietrich for a news conference in mid-February in which they called on Pritzker to drop mask mandates in public schools.  ""For the last year at least, I contend two years, the observed science, scores of studies, real world observations have told us there is absolutely no observed or clinical data that indicates any benefit whatsoever to masking K-12 students in schools."" Wilhour said. The claim follows a downstate judge’s recent order that said Pritzker’s school mask requirements and other restrictions went too far. Pritkzer’s appeal of the ruling was dismissed Thursday by an Illinois appellate court.  We decided to investigate Wilhour’s claim that ""there is absolutely no observed or clinical data that indicates any benefit whatsoever to masking K-12 students in schools."" Asked for evidence underpinning his claim, Wilhour provided various links to studies and articles and said there are over 150 studies that have found no benefit of masks in schools. ""Studies have never found school related transmission to be a significant factor in community spread,"" Wilhour said in an email. One link Wilhour sent us was for a May 2021 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, where the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states, ""To date, there have been no U.S. studies comparing COVID-19 incidence in schools that varied in implementing recommended prevention strategies, including mask requirements and ventilation improvements."" But in that same report, the CDC also summarized a 2020 study conducted in K-5 Georgia schools showing the incidence of COVID-19 was 37% lower in schools with mask requirements for teachers and staff. In the most recently updated version of the ""Science Brief: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in K-12 Schools and Early Care and Education Programs"" the agency concluded: ""When a combination of effective prevention strategies is implemented and strictly adhered to in the K-12 in-person learning environment, the risk of transmission in the school setting appears to be lower than or equivalent to the transmission risk in other community settings.""  The CDC brief included observations conducted in cities throughout the U.S., including Chicago. For instance, a study of private schools’ masking policies and limited class sizes found minimal in-school transmission, according to the CDC. Additional CDC mask studies demonstrating the observed benefit of masks include: A 2020 study of 11 North Carolina school districts where students practiced social distancing and wore masks for at least nine weeks in the fall semester reported minimal school-related transmission.  A Utah study of elementary schools implementing multiple prevention strategies, including wearing masks, found low transmission from December 2020 through January 2021. An Arizona study in two counties during the delta variant surge found outbreaks were three and a half times more likely in schools without mask mandates. The CDC did not respond to requests for comment. There is plenty of observational evidence that masks work, so we turned to Wilhour’s assertion about a lack of clinical data. One epidemiology expert we talked to said such an assertion ignores the fact that clinical trials exposing unprotected children to COVID-19 would be patently wrong. A clinical trial would involve exposing a control group of unprotected children to the deadly virus, the expert said. ""We will not get clinical trials on this because it is unethical to randomize kids to not use masks given overwhelming evidence of the risks based on observational studies,"" said Dr. Mercedes Carnethon of Northwestern University. She said public health decisions are often made without clinical trials for the same reasons.  ""There are also no clinical data to support the use of seatbelts in cars to reduce automobile fatalities,"" Carnethon said. ""Those decisions and policies are based on observational data collected over years to show that the rates of death are lower for passengers who wear seatbelts."" Wilhour said there is absolutely no observed or clinical data that indicates any benefit whatsoever to masking K-12 students in schools. Clinical studies cannot be conducted on this issue because of the risk they would pose to unprotected children, but observational data shows masks are beneficial in reducing transmissions in schools. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Fact-checking Ron DeSantis’ claim that a U.S. process doesn't vet immigrants
","In a conference with religious and community leaders, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis criticized President Joe Biden for ""failed border policies."" DeSantis said that a federal program that deals with unaccompanied minors who arrive at the border was especially problematic. ""The current (Unaccompanied Alien Children) process smuggles in illegal immigrants from many different countries with no vetting, no transparency, and no consideration for child and public safety,"" DeSantis said in a news conference on Feb. 7  in Miami.  His claim that the program had no vetting or transparency sounded at odds with what we know about the process, so we decided to put his comments on the Truth-O-Meter. We found that immigration officials do, in fact, screen children to determine if they are victims of trafficking and check if they have a criminal record. The federal government also provides general information to the public about the number of children in its care and how many eventually settle in each state. Long before Biden became president, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the unaccompanied children’s program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to address a growing number of migrant children arriving in the U.S. without a parent or legal guardian.   The law provides protection to these minors and often allows them to stay in the United States. In recent years, most of these children have arrived at the southwest border and surrendered to Border Patrol agents. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials then screen the children to determine if they pose a safety threat or have a viable immigration case.  CBP then transfers the children to the custody of another non-immigration agency, the Office of Refugee Resettlement. That office then tries to place the children with sponsors in the U.S. It also conducts criminal checks on all potential sponsors to ensure they’re not a threat to the minors’ safety.  ""The Office of Refugee Resettlement is a child welfare agency, not a law enforcement agency,"" an HHS spokesperson told PolitiFact. ""We play no role in the processing of unaccompanied children prior to their referral to HHS custody."" In fiscal year 2021, the number of unaccompanied children referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement ballooned to 122,731, the largest number in the program’s history. Experts and immigration authorities rejected DeSantis’ claim that unaccompanied children are not vetted.  CBP told PolitiFact that it gathers biometric data and biographical information, such as fingerprints and birth certificates, to uncover any criminal history.  Children with criminal histories are deemed inadmissible and expelled by immigration authorities — that was the case for fewer than 2% of the children encountered in fiscal year 2021, according to a Congressional Research Service report. The Office of Refugee Resettlement said that if a child sent to its custody is later discovered to have a criminal background or demonstrates violent behavior, the child may be placed in a secure facility and will stay there unless it is determined they no longer pose a threat to others.  Children with no criminal histories are placed in nonprofit-run shelters until sponsors take them into their custody. When we asked DeSantis’ office about his ""no vetting"" claim, his press secretary, Christina Pushaw, cited the 2021 arrest of a Honduran national suspected of murdering a Jacksonville resident. But we could not independently verify whether that person entered the country as an unaccompanied minor. The now-24-year-old suspect, Yery Noel Medina Ulloa, was arrested and booked under a false name and age — Reynel Hernandez, 17 years old, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office police report. (He was 23 at the time of his arrest.) The police report did not say when Medina Ulloa entered the country, whether he misrepresented himself as an unaccompanied minor to immigration authorities, or whether he had a criminal record that went undetected by federal officials. PolitiFact asked CBP, HHS and the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office about Medina Ulloa’s immigration history but did not get a response. CBP in November said that there had been cases of people abusing the unaccompanied minor process. Transnational criminal organizations, for example, try to recruit, exploit and convince people to pose as unaccompanied minors as they are smuggled into the United States. In fiscal year 2021, which began in October 2020 during the Trump administration, Border Patrol agents in the El Paso, Texas, sector encountered 559 adults posing as unaccompanied children, according to CBP. The agency said that ""a proactive approach"" by Border Patrol agents led to a ""substantial increase in the detection"" of people who fraudulently pose as unaccompanied minors. Still, this does not support DeSantis’ claim of no vetting or transparency. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, under the Trump administration, issued a public health order allowing Border Patrol agents to rapidly expel migrants crossing the southwest border.  Unaccompanied children were not excluded from the initial order and were turned away. Though this program is still in effect, Biden has now exempted children from expulsion.  The Biden administration has also scrapped a Trump-era proposal that would have authorized the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to require biometric data, including DNA and facial images, from immigrants.  While DeSantis blamed the growing number of unaccompanied children on Biden’s immigration policies, experts cited a combination of factors driving increases, including pandemic-torn economies and labor demand.  ""Broadly, I don’t see the Biden administration doing anything radically different than the pre-Trump administrations,"" said David Kyle, associate professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis. As for transparency, HHS provides some broad information on unaccompanied minors. In 2021, DeSantis' office requested information that HHS does not release to the public out of privacy and safety concerns, such as the children’s names and the cities where they settled with sponsors.  Pushaw cited this as an example of the program’s inadequate transparency, contending that the state should be notified of the children’s arrival in advance. The HHS annually releases state-by-state data on how many unaccompanied children are released to sponsors. In 2021, more than 11,000 unaccompanied children were released to sponsors in Florida. Only Texas received more children. It is worth noting that advocacy groups have criticized the HHS for not providing more information regarding the department’s monitoring and oversight of facilities that house unaccompanied children.   ""Child protection is of utmost importance so children’s privacy cannot be revealed to the public,"" said Jennifer Podkul, vice president for policy and advocacy at Kids In Need of Defense, an advocacy group for unaccompanied migrant and refugee children in the U.S. ""But the agency can and should be more transparent about the steps they take to monitor and correct any deficiencies they see in the shelters housing children."" The U.S. government lost contact with thousands of children released from its custody in 2021, Axios reported. About 1 in 3 calls made to sponsors between January and May of last year went unanswered. ""The transparency is limited, but we cannot say no transparency, no vetting, no consideration for child or public safety,"" said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, associate professor at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government. DeSantis said the current unaccompanied children process has ""no vetting, no transparency."" But young people who enter federal custody undergo security screening by immigration officials. The Office of Refugee Resettlement reviews the background and biographical information of children in its custody. It also conducts a criminal check on all potential sponsors to ensure they’re not a threat to the minor’s safety.  HHS doesn’t release identifying data — such as the names of children in its custody — citing security and privacy, but releases broad data, such as the number of children in its facilities. Advocates have asked for more transparency to ensure the well-being of minors. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Stubbs’ 48-hour gun waiting period statement backed by some studies, but other factors muddy claim
","On Feb. 2, 2016, Caroline Nosal, 24, of Stoughton, was shot to death by a 26-year-old former co-worker outside the grocery store where she worked – and from where the assailant was suspended, then fired for harassing Nosal.  Exactly six years later, her father, James Nosal, spoke at a Madison news conference where a pair of Democratic lawmakers announced a bill that would reinstate a 48-hour waiting period on handgun purchases in Wisconsin. In 2015, then-Gov. Scott Walker signed a bill repealing the nearly 40-year-old provision, arguing that it was outdated because background checks could now be performed so much faster than before. In pushing for a renewed 48-hour period at the news conference, James Nosal asked of the man who killed his daughter: ""If he had had to wait 48 hours, would he have rethought his plan?""  State Rep. Shelia Stubbs, D-Madison, is sponsoring the bill – which is a longshot in the Republican-controlled Legislature – with state Sen. Melissa Agard, D-Madison. According to an analysis of current law by the Legislative Reference Bureau, before a federally licensed firearms dealer may transfer a handgun after a sale, the dealer must have the Department of Justice perform a background check to determine if the purchaser is prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal or state law. Under the proposal  – AB1059 in the Assembly and SB1003,1,2 in the Senate – the dealer would be prohibited from transferring the handgun until 48 hours after the background check was requested.  In a Feb. 2, 2022 tweet, Stubbs described the need this way: ""48-Hour waiting periods limit crimes of passion and keep our communities safe. Every weapon has the ability to permanently impact individuals, families, and entire communities. Without a waiting period, we allow impulsive decisions to result in terrible consequences.""  We’re interested in the first sentence: Do such waiting periods ""limit crimes of passion and keep our communities safe""? And, if so, what research supports it? When asked for backup, Stubbs cited a 2017 study published by researchers from the Harvard Business School that examined the impact of waiting periods in the United States from 1970 to 2014.  According to the study, waiting periods reduced firearm homicides by 17% and states with waiting periods avoided around 750 homicides per year. Stubbs also cited a 2018 Behavioral Scientist article, ""The Case for Handgun Waiting Periods,"" by the same researchers who noted that ""research from behavioral economics and psychology has found that intense emotions like anger and sadness — ‘visceral factors,’ in academic language — can cause people to take actions they later regret, such as resorting to gun violence."" The researcher went on to say that those intense emotions are often transitory. ""Given sufficient time to cool off, the types of intense negative emotions that lead to violent tendencies can pass,"" the researchers wrote. ""This suggests that inserting even a short delay in the gun-buying process has the potential to reduce gun violence, without restricting anyone’s right to own a gun.""  Finally, she cited a Wisconsin-focused study, published Feb. 21, 2021, that examined suicide rates in the wake of the repeal of the waiting period in Wisconsin. Using state mortality data, the researchers concluded that the repeal ""correlated with the increase of firearm-related suicides among Wisconsin residents of color and Wisconsinites residing in urban counties.""  John Gross, a clinical associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Law, told us it can be hard to determine how a particular policy change, such as waiting periods, impacts crime rates or public safety.  ""When it comes to waiting periods, older studies have shown mixed results,"" he said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Some have shown a small decrease in gun violence while others found no correlation between waiting periods and gun violence."" Thomas Leager, executive director of Waupaca-based Wisconsin Gun Owners Inc., argued that a waiting period does not by itself stop a crime, particularly if a gun is bought ""off the black market.""  (Indeed, in Wisconsin, and many other states, background checks are not required for purchase of any guns from sellers who are not federally licensed dealers. This is the ""loophole"" that gun-control activists often cite – sales between friends, online or unlicensed dealers at gun shows). Leager also noted that a waiting period could prevent people from getting a gun in time to protect themselves: ""A waiting period for a woman who is being stalked or harassed could literally be deadly.""  Setting the rhetoric aside, when it comes to the ""keeping communities safe"" aspect of the claim, there are studies that support Stubbs’ claim, but there are many situations where a gun could still be obtained without any such wait. So, that information is missing. Stubbs’ claim is more problematic when it comes to her assertion that waiting periods would reduce ""crimes of passion."" On the surface, it would seem obvious: If you don’t have a gun at the time, you can’t shoot someone in that moment. But the very definition, a ""crime of passion"" involves an illegal action committed in the heat of the moment in response to provocation (as opposed to an illegal act that was premeditated or deliberate). So if a gun were involved in such an incident, the perpetrator would already have it. Gross, the UW-Madison professor, noted that recent studies have found a correlation between waiting periods and a reduction in suicides.  ""The most common form of gun violence is actually suicide,"" he wrote. ""So if Rep. Stubbs is including suicide as a ‘crime of passion,’ which the correlation between delaying the purchase of a gun and decreased suicide rates suggests it is, then the statement is true."" At the same time, Gross noted that many believe suicide should not be considered a crime, so designating it as a ""crime of passion"" could be misleading.  Finally, he said, there is plenty of evidence that the presence of a gun in a home significantly increases the chances that one partner will commit homicide.  ""For example, one study showed that direct access to guns during a domestic violence incident increases the likelihood of a female victim’s homicide compared to other acts of violence by 11 times,"" Gross said. ""What we don’t know is whether a waiting period significantly impacts the rate of gun ownership over the long term, which would then reduce the number of homes where there was a gun and, consequently, would reduce the rate of intimate partner violence or ‘crimes of passion.’ "" Stubbs claimed ""48-Hour waiting periods limit crimes of passion and keep our communities safe."" Some studies have shown reductions in homicides in states with a waiting period, but many guns are obtained illegally or through sellers where background checks are not required. Meanwhile, ""crimes of passion,"" by their very definition, happen in the moment, so if a gun were involved in such cases, the perpetrator would already have it. That said, studies show a waiting period can reduce suicides. So there is some evidence for both parts of the claim, as well as factors that muddy the water. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.
