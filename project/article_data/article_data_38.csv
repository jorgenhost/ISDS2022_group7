Donald Trump's False claim veterans treated worse than illegal immigrants
","Donald Trump has repeatedly said immigrants living illegally in the United States have it better than veterans who have served the country. He said it over Memorial Day weekend at a rally honoring prisoners of wars and troops missing in action, during a speech in Arizona outlining his immigration plan and most recently at the Union League of Philadelphia, which supports veterans and their families. ""Our veterans, in many cases, are being treated worse than illegal immigrants, people that come into our country illegally,"" Trump said Sept. 7. His campaign stuck by the claim, offering evidence he is right. We decided to take a deeper look. The Trump campaign’s argument In an email, the Trump campaign claimed that many politicians give more attention and pledge more support to those in the country illegally than to veterans. Specifically, Trump’s campaign said Hillary Clinton ""downplayed"" the Department of Veterans Affairs scandal about veterans waiting for months for medical care. (We rated Mostly False a claim by Trump that Clinton is ""satisfied"" with the VA.) They also noted that she has not demanded ""the introduction of a massive veterans benefits bill her first 100 days as president."" Instead, she said pledged ""to fight for illegal immigrants and spend taxpayer dollars granting them benefits, such as Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare."" (We rated a similar claim by Trump Mostly False that Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days and to provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for undocumented immigrants.) Trump’s campaign also pointed to a 2008 Washington Post article noting that a man had previously been convicted of drunken driving but not questioned about his immigration status. He later killed two people while drunk and speeding, and sentenced to 24 years in prison. ""Illegal immigrants convicted of DUIs are often released without any immigration consequences,"" Trump’s press team wrote. ""But members of the military who receive DUIs are subject punishment from their commanding officers and court martial."" The campaign also said that in terms of financial resources, billions of dollars are spent at all levels of government on undocumented immigrants, about $950 million were budgeted for fiscal year 2016 to care for children who entered the country illegally without their parents, cost to house undocumented immigrants in prisons in fiscal year 2014 was $1.87 billion. Other than the anecdote about the DUI case, we’re not sure any of these examples show how veterans are being treated worse than people living in the United States illegally. So we decided to directly compare the two groups using things Trump often talks about -- education, health care and tax and fiscal policy. Education In terms of K-12 public education, the Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that no one can be denied access, even if they are undocumented, said Irene Bloemraad, a sociology professor at the University of California. That equal access also applies to veterans, but presumably veterans are not seeking K-12 education, Bloemraad said. ""At best, we can conclude no advantage, one way or another, at this level of education,"" she said. That Supreme Court ruling does not apply to post-secondary education and it’s up to states to set the rules regarding undocumented immigrants’ access to public colleges and universities, Bloemraad said. Two states -- Alabama and South Carolina -- bar undocumented students from enrolling in public postsecondary institutions. Georgia’s State Board of Regents does not allow undocumented students to enroll in selective public universities (institutions that admit fewer than apply), according to University Leaders for Educational Access and Diversity Network. ""Veterans would presumably face no ban to enrolling,"" Bloemraad said. ""So clearly, veterans are not treated worse; rather, in some states undocumented students are in a much more difficult position."" A veteran resident can also pay in-state tuition rates and can apply for federal benefits for post-secondary education, she said. Higher education and training benefits are available to veterans, servicemembers and their families through federal programs such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Undocumented students are not eligible for federal financial aid. In some states, undocumented students are required to pay higher, out-of-state rates for their education, even if they have lived in that state most of their life, Bloemraad said. Overall: Advantage veterans. Medical care The Emer­gency Med­ical Treat­ment and Active Labor Act, enacted by Congress in 1986, provided that hospitals provide anyone emergency care until stabilized, said Gail Wilensky, former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. So undocumented immigrants, by law, can get immediate emergency care -- but so can veterans. In this regard, both groups are treated the same in case of medical emergencies. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible to buy health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Veterans enrolled in the Veteran’s Affairs health care system (about 9 million of the 22 million veterans) are not eligible for the Affordable Care Act, but others would be -- unless they are eligible or have other coverage such as Medicare or employer-sponsored insurance, Wilensky said. Still, veterans are eligible for medical care. It’s ""hard to think of an example where an illegal immigrant would get better care,"" Wilensky said. Some of the Veterans Affairs care is clearly substandard or delayed, but that’s a different problem, she said. Katherine Baicker, a health economist at the Harvard University, said there are limits to the programs and care available to undocumented immigrants. They are not eligible for Medicaid, for instance, she said. Veterans are eligible for Medicaid and those who qualify usually do not pay copays for Veterans Affairs health care, according to the Veterans Affairs Department. ""I can't think of ways in which veterans have less access or lower quality care than undocumented immigrants,"" Baicker said. Overall: Advantage veterans. Taxes, Social Security Veteran’s benefits generally are not subject to tax and many tax provisions benefit service members, said Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. Pay earned while serving in a combat zone is exempt from federal income tax, he said. ""I can't think of any tax issue that would hit troops harder than undocumented immigrants,"" Williams said. Veterans are entitled to Social Security benefits. Laws enacted in 1996 and 2004 block Social Security benefits paid to unauthorized immigrants or to any noncitizen without a work-authorized Social Security number at some point in time, according to the Social Security Administration. As the Associated Press has also noted, undocumented immigrants don’t have the right to vote, don’t have legal permission to work or to receive most government benefits. Veterans who are citizens have the right to vote, have job employment resources such as the Veterans Employment Center and may qualify for Veteran Affairs health benefits. Overall: Advantage veterans. Our ruling Trump said, ""Our veterans, in many cases, are being treated worse than illegal immigrants."" In some states undocumented immigrants are barred from enrolling in post-secondary institutions, or pay out-of-state tuition even if they’ve lived in that state most of their lives; veterans are eligible for federal benefits for higher education and training and are eligible for in-state tuition. Undocumented immigrants also aren’t eligible for Medicaid, cannot buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act and cannot receive Social Security benefits, all of those services and benefits are available to veterans. Veterans also have the right to vote and are eligible for federal job placement resources. Veterans are entitled to several more benefits that are not offered to civilians, much less undocumented immigrants.

Did Ron Johnson approve a $10 million payout for himself?
","Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson has touted his private-sector experience in his 2016 re-election bid, just as he did in 2010. But it’s a big final payday his opponent wants you to remember. Russ Feingold invoked the matter in a campaign ad in June. Then again in early July. And again in late July. The central claim in all three is that Johnson gave himself a $10 million payout when he left his Oshkosh manufacturing firm after winning the 2010 election. The ads imply there’s something shady about the payment, particularly one launched June 14, 2016. Black and white images of Johnson, the U.S. Capitol and cash fill the screen as a narrator ominously states: ""Before Sen. Johnson left for Washington, he gave himself $10 million, a sweetheart corporate payout."" Was such a payment made, and, if so, is there anything questionable about it? Let’s dig in. Johnson’s $10 million At issue is money Johnson received shortly before taking office in 2011. It came to light in a federal Financial Disclosure Report that listed the payment as compensation from Pacur, the company he helped found and bought in 1997. Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Dan Bice in 2011 the payment was back pay for serving as CEO the previous 13 years, as he had not taken a paycheck since purchasing the company. Johnson sold most of the company in 2010 and stopped active involvement in its operations, though he retains a 5 percent stake, according to campaign spokesman William Allison. Johnson hasn’t gone into much detail on the nature of the payout, saying at the time, ""It's a private business. I've complied with all the disclosure laws, and I don't have to explain it any further to someone like you."" The column noted the pay didn’t appear to be part of a pre-determined compensation package. Johnson described the payment in 2011 as an ""agreed-upon amount,"" then acknowledged the person who agreed to it was the owner — himself. Allison said Pacur followed ""followed standard business practices to settle the account and independently calculate the back pay (Johnson) was owed as a result."" He said the payout was reviewed as part of a routine IRS audit and the IRS ""took no issue with it."" Allison declined to elaborate on the process by which the $10 million amount was decided and approved. So Johnson received $10 million. Does that make it a ""sweetheart corporate payout"" as the ad claims? That’s a pretty subjective description, but it implies there was something special or unusual about the amount. When considered as back pay, the $10 million works out to about $770,000 per year. That would be a ""fairly typical"" compensation package for an owner and CEO of a company the size of Pacur, according to a blog post last year in Plastics News. The trade publication does an annual executive pay study for the plastics industry, though it noted it had to estimate the size of Pacur since the private company does not release sales information. David Walker, a professor and executive compensation expert at Boston University School of Law, said that annual amount ""doesn’t seem implausible,"" for someone in Johnson’s position, since many owners of small businesses take out most of the profits as compensation. But like other experts contacted by PolitiFact Wisconsin, Walker said it’s hard to put the amount in context since Pacur is a private company, so we don’t know key factors like its size, profits and other executive compensation. The timing of Johnson’s payment is also noteworthy, though it’s not directly addressed in any of Feingold’s ads. The original column points out the $10 million payment came on the heels of a campaign where Johnson spent $9 million of his own money. Critics said the payout looked like an attempt to circumvent federal regulations and have the company pay for Johnson’s campaign. Corporations are not allowed to contribute directly to federal or state campaigns, and they can’t give money to a candidate for the express purpose of reimbursing campaign costs. The Federal Election Commission never issued a public finding regarding the payment to Johnson. A group claimed to have submitted a complaint last year, but an FEC spokeswoman said it the agency never received it. Election lawyers told Bice in 2011 that Johnson likely didn’t violate any election laws, and proving otherwise would have required a written agreement or other direct proof of a prior plan to reimburse campaign expenses. Such proof never surfaced. Our rating In a recent TV ad, Feingold claims Johnson gave himself $10 million in a  ""sweetheart corporate payout."" The amount is accurate, and Johnson did essentially give it to himself since he acknowledged he was the one to approve it. But there’s no evidence to show this payment was unusual or out of line, as the tone and use of the ""sweetheart"" descriptor imply. An industry trade publication said the amount is reasonable given Johnson’s role and longevity. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.",/factchecks/2016/sep/09/russ-feingold/did-ron-johnson-approve-10m-bonus-himself/

Facts take a vacation in Occupy Democrats' post about presidential, congressional time off
","When President Barack Obama was vacationing on Martha's Vineyard and his critics were chastising him for not visiting flood victims in Louisiana, the liberal group Occupy Democrats created a message on their Facebook page trying to contrast Obama's work record against the Republican Congress. Below a photograph of Obama are the words, ""Has taken less vacation days than any other president in a generation."" Below an image of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan are the words, ""Have taken more vacation days than any other Congress in history."" The introduction to the Aug. 20 image insists, ""The numbers don't lie."" It had been shared 45,470 times by Sept. 6, 2016. Bad grammar aside (it should be ""fewer"" vacation days, not ""less""), we wanted to know if the data checked out. We repeatedly contacted the group but didn't hear back. Presidential vacations First, it's important to realize that if you're only going back a generation (20 years), you're only comparing Obama to two other presidents — Bill Clinton who took office in 1993 and George W. Bush, who was inaugurated in 2001. We turned to Mark Knoller, White House correspondent at CBS News, the zen master of data on all things presidential such as vacations, trips, news conferences and even teleprompter use. He told us via email that Obama has been on 28 vacations (including long weekends) spanning all or part of 217 days. The president has just over four months left in his term. His predecessor, Bush, made 77 visits to his Texas ranch spanning all or part of 490 days. There were also 11 visits to his parent's home in Kennebunkport, Maine, spanning all or part of 43 days. Total: 533. But by Knoller's count, Clinton took the fewest — 174 days of summer vacations on Martha’s Vineyard and at Jackson Hole, Wyo. So the first part of the Occupy Democrats post is wrong. (It's also worth noting, as Knoller does, that a president never really goes on vacation. The job goes with him.) Congressional vacations  We didn't have to go very far back in time to discover that this part of the Occupy Democrats meme is wrong as well. Defining vacation days for Congress is harder than for a president. After all, when members don't have to be in Washington for a vote, they may be in their districts, meeting with voters, or attending to official duties. And let's be real here — they might also be treating it like a vacation. As of Sept. 6, 2016, the House had been in session 94 days. The Senate had been in session 114 days. We decided to start by looking at House calendars. This year, the House is scheduled to be in session for another 32 days. That means House members will have been officially working in Washington for a total of about 126 days. That’s more days on the calendar than in 2008, when House members met for 119 calendar days, and in 2006, when they met for 104 days. The House looks even less lazy if you look at 2015, the first year of the current Congress. That year, the House met for 157 calendar days, more than in 2014 (137 days), 2012 (153 days), 2010 (128 days), 2008 (119 days) and 2006 (104 days). Alternatively, we looked at the data in two-year blocks, which would be full sessions of Congress. The current House (the 114th session, 2015-16) has met or is scheduled to meet for 283 days. But in the 109th session (2005-06) it met for 247 days, which is 36 days fewer. In fact, the current session is slated to have more days than the 105th, 106th, 107th and 108th Congresses as well. We found the same pattern in the Senate, which has met, or is scheduled to meet, for 156 days this year. It didn't matter whether we looked at projected days this year or actual days last year. Since 2000, there were at least six years the Senate met fewer times. And when we combined House and Senate tallies, the current 114th Congress is on track to have officially worked in Washington more days than the 113th, 109th, 108th, 107th and 106th Congresses. Our ruling Occupy Democrats says Obama ""has taken less vacation days than any other president in a generation,"" while Congress ""has taken more vacation days than any other Congress in history."" The post is wrong for Obama. It is ridiculously wrong for Congress. We rate it Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2016/sep/09/occupy-democrats/facts-take-vacation-occupy-democrats-claim-about-p/

Healthcare union twists Leslie Munger's comments on social services cuts
","On paper, the race for Illinois state comptroller is about which candidate is best qualified to be keeper of the state's checkbook. In reality, though, it's become an extension of the bitter budget war that's been waged for more than a year between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan. Democrats and their supporters are doing everything possible to link incumbent Republican Leslie Geissler Munger to Rauner’s ""reforms before revenue"" position that has perpetuated the budget impasse and hurt social social service providers. Democratic comptroller candidate and Chicago City Clerk Susana Mendoza has made the connection the central theme of her campaign. In a YouTube video published Aug. 29, SEIU Healthcare of Illinois and Indiana, a union that represents health care and child care workers and is one of the sharpest critics of the anti-union Rauner, zeroed in on Munger for remarks she made during an Aug. 25 Chicago Tribune editorial board debate. SEIU claims Munger, who was appointed by then-Gov.-elect Rauner after the sudden death of Judy Baar Topinka in December 2014, said the state would have to ""cut social services completely"" in order to balance the budget. The 40-second YouTube video takes clips from the debate with the state’s four comptroller candidates, and includes a description that says: ""In an interview with the Chicago Tribune’s Editorial Board, Comptroller Leslie Munger says that in order to balance a budget, the state would have to ‘cut social services completely.’"" The union repeated the charge in a tweet:  Politicians frequently argue about how to better manage social services, but we’ve never heard of any candidate advocating eliminating all programs that assist society’s most vulnerable citizens. We decided to look into SEIU’s claim. Context of comptroller’s comments  James Muhammad, communications director for SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana, confirmed the YouTube video was referencing comments Munger made during the editorial board debate. Munger was asked by the editorial board whether she agrees with Rauner that reforms from his Turnaround Agenda must be passed before there’s an agreement on a full-year budget. Rauner sees his plan as helping business; his opponents see it as an anti-union assault in the guise of reform. While the comptroller did not answer the question directly, Munger said workers’ compensation reform and a property tax freeze are two of the governor’s reform items she believes would help businesses create more jobs, expand the tax base and grow the economy. This is where the SEIU YouTube video claims Munger said the state would have to ""cut social services completely"" to balance the budget. ""We have to pass a balanced budget. I don’t know how you pass a balanced budget, unless you literally cut social services completely as an example, cut education,"" Munger said. ""You cannot get to a balanced budget without a growing economy in our state right now. We cannot do it."" The video includes Munger’s comments in their entirety, though both the title and the description imply the comptroller was saying the state needs to completely eliminate funding for social services to balance the budget. Despite Munger making clear she was using such cuts as ""an example"" to illustrate how drastic cuts alone would have to be, SEIU makes it appear as if Munger wants and is proposing to eliminate all funding for social services in the video as well as on its social media accounts. Munger reiterated her support for an income tax increase as long as it’s ""coupled"" with reductions in spending, noting the current individual income tax rate of 3.75 percent would have to be hiked up to about 8 percent just to pay down the state’s current $8.1 billion backlog of unpaid bills. ""You cannot cut enough to get to a balanced budget, so you need revenue,"" Munger said during the debate. ""And you cannot raise revenue enough to get it balanced without a growing economy."" This statement also debunks SEIU’s contention that Munger wants to ""cut social services completely,"" and further clarifies she was saying the state never would be able to make cuts as severe as what you would need to balance the budget as things currently stand. Our ruling In a YouTube video, SEIU Healthcare Illinois and Indiana said: ""In an interview with the Chicago Tribune's Editorial Board, Comptroller Leslie Munger says that in order to balance a budget, the state would have to ‘cut social services completely.’"" The video, along with a tweet from the union’s Twitter account, gives the impression Munger wants to cut all funding for social services in order to balance the budget. However, both the video and the tweet take Munger’s comments out of context and fail to acknowledge she was speaking hypothetically. In addition, Munger’s statement that the state ""cannot cut enough to get to a balanced budget"" and ""cannot raise revenue enough to get it balanced without a growing economy"" undercuts SEIU’s contention that she wants to cut all social services. Essentially, Munger’s point is that lawmakers never would be able to make cuts as severe as what would be needed to balance the budget without new revenue.

PAC backing Gary Johnson says Dick Cheney 'supported gay marriage sooner' than Hillary Clinton
","A viral online ad by a group supporting Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson features Abe Lincoln urging Americans to dump Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and vote for Johnson. The funny, five-minute video by AlternativePAC begins with the Lincoln impersonator standing outside a log cabin. ""Oh, hey America, it’s me, dead Abe Lincoln, and you just got screwed,"" he says, ""because you have to choose between a corrupt president or a crazy president."" ""Here’s Hillary, who’s like a Monopoly player using her get out of jail free card, then a rig an election card, and make millions on political favors card,"" Abe says. ""And Trump, who’s like if your racist uncle got drunk and ran for president, and then the nation got drunk and said, ‘That guy should have nuclear bombs.'"" Abe's pitch: Consider Gary Johnson, the former New Mexico governor, as a sensible third-party option. Since AlternativePAC posted the ad Aug. 25 on its website BalancedRebellion.com it has been viewed 18.3 million times on the group’s Facebook page. Among fake Abe’s many zingers, this one caught our attention: ""Hillary’s policies are the same as Dick Cheney’s, except Cheney supported gay marriage sooner!"" We did not fact-check the line that Hillary’s policies are the same as Dick Cheney's"" -- because their positions aren't identical, and it smacks of humorous hyperbole. Instead we focused on the claim that ""Cheney supported gay marriage sooner"" than Clinton. Same-sex marriage is a personal issue for Cheney, who served as vice president to President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009. His second-oldest daughter, Mary Cheney, is openly gay and she married her longtime partner, Heather Poe, in 2012. She also served as a senior campaign advisor to her father during the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. Cheney broke with conservative orthodoxy on same-sex marriage during his Oct. 5, 2000, vice presidential debate against Sen. Joe Lieberman. Debate moderator Bernie Bernard Shaw of CNN asked the candidates if gay couples should ""have all the constitutional rights enjoyed by every American citizen?"" ""The fact of the matter is we live in a free society, and freedom means freedom for everybody,"" Cheney replied. ""We don't get to choose, and shouldn't be able to choose and say, 'You get to live free, but you don't.' I think that means that people should be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to enter into."" (Watch the debate; Cheney discusses gay marriage at 1:17)   Cheney said the question of whether there should be an ""official sanction"" of same-sex relationships should be left to states -- which have traditionally overseen marriage laws. ""I don't think there should necessarily be a federal policy in this area,"" he added. Cheney’s stand drew criticism from conservatives and praise from gay groups, the New York Times reported. In his 2011 memoir, In My Time, Cheney wrote of his debate comments: ""I had given the issue a lot of thought and answered it from the heart. ...Of course, I had my daughter Mary and her partner, Heather Poe, in my mind, but I was also thinking about what's right for all of us as Americans if we truly believe in freedom."" During the Bush-Cheney 2004 re-election race, the vice president spelled out his differences on gay marriage with President Bush, who had endorsed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, the Washington Post reported. For the first time, Cheney discussed the sexual orientation of his daughter, Mary. Asked his position on the issue at an Iowa town hall meeting, Cheney said: ""Lynne and I have a gay daughter, so it's an issue that our family is very familiar with. ... With respect to the question of relationships, my general view is that freedom means freedom for everyone. People ought to be able to free -- ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to."" He again said that same-sex marriage should be left to the states to decide, while noting Bush’s endorsement of the amendment to prevent states from recognizing gay marriages. ""At this point ... my own preference is as I've stated,"" Cheney said. ""But the president makes basic policy for the administration. And he's made it. "" At a June 2009 National Press Club event, a journalist asked Cheney, given the Iowa Supreme Court's ruling legalizing game marriage at the time, ""is some form of legalized gay marriage inevitable in the United States?"" The former vice president repeated his mantra on the issue, saying, ""Freedom means freedom for everyone. And as many of you know, one of my daughters is gay, and something that we’ve lived with for a long time in our family. I think people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish, any kind of arrangement they wish."" He appeared to positively view the movement by some states to legalize gay marriage. ""I think people ought to get a shot at that. And they do at present."" (Watch a video of Cheney's remarks.) Clinton's flip-flop As for Hillary Clinton, PolitiFact has reported that the Democratic presidential nominee opposed gay marriage for more than a decade before she came out in support of it in 2013. We found that as public opinion shifted toward support for same-sex marriage, so did Clinton. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that defined federal marriage as a union between one man and one woman. It also denied same-sex couples access to federal benefits, including Social Security survivor benefits and health care benefits along with barring gay couples from filing joint federal tax returns and receiving income and estate tax benefits for spouses. Hillary Clinton began facing questions about same-sex marriage during her 2000 campaign for the U.S. Senate. In December 1999, Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said she supported the Defense of Marriage Act, but added that ""same-sex unions should be recognized and that same-sex unions should be entitled to all the rights and privileges that every other American gets,"" the New York Times reported. In July 2004, Clinton spoke on the Senate floor saying she -- like Cheney -- opposed a proposed federal amendment to ban same-sex marriage. (The amendment ultimately failed.) Though she opposed it, she said that she believed that marriage was ""a sacred bond between a man and a woman."" But her opposition continued to soften as popular support for same-sex marriage increased. In October 2006, Clinton told a private gathering of gay elected officials that she would support same-sex marriage in New York if a future governor and Legislature chose to enact such a law.   During her 2008 run for president, Clinton backed away from the Defense of Marriage Act in a May 2007 questionnaire for the Human Rights Campaign: ""I support repealing the provision of DOMA that may prohibit the federal government from providing benefits to people in states that recognize same-sex marriage."" However, the New York Times reported that presidential candidate Clinton in 2008 continued to explicitly opposed same-sex marriage, saying that she favored civil unions but that decisions about the legality of marriage should be left to the states. As Clinton prepared for her second presidential bid, she announced her support for same-sex marriage in a video with the Human Rights Campaign on March 18, 2013. ""LGBT Americans are our colleagues, our teachers, our soldiers, our friends, our loved ones. And they are full and equal citizens, and they deserve the rights of citizenship. That includes marriage. That’s why I support marriage for lesbian and gay couples,"" she said. ""I support it personally and as a matter of policy and law, embedded in a broader effort to advance equality and opportunity for LGBT Americans and all Americans."" Our ruling AlternativePAC says ""(Dick) Cheney supported gay marriage sooner"" than Hillary Clinton. The historical record is clear. Cheney spoke out in favor of gay marriage during the 2000 vice presidential debate, saying, ""freedom means freedom for everybody… I think we ought to do everything we can to tolerate and accommodate whatever kind of relationships people want to enter into."" He said any ""official sanction"" of same-sex relationships should be left to states -- not the federal government. In the 2004 presidential election, Cheney broke with Bush, who supported a congressional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Clinton opposed same-sex marriage as a candidate for the Senate, while in office as a senator, and while running for president in 2008. She expressed her support for civil unions starting in 2000, opposed the proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in 2004 and voiced support for the rights of states to set their own laws in favor of gay marriage in 2006. She came out in support of same-sex marriage in 2013.

Patrick Murphy wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare, Senate GOP says
","The GOP is attempting to link Senate hopeful and U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy to the third rail of Florida politics, saying he wants to cut both Social Security and Medicare. Playing off questions about Murphy’s job history, the National Republican Senatorial Committee created a website called RealMurphyResume.com. The site spins a partisan look at the Jupiter Democrat’s qualifications and policy positions, and says one of his priorities was to ""Advocate for cuts to Social Security and Medicare."" When we first looked over the website on Sept. 7, 2016, we wondered if Murphy really did say he wanted to cut the two programs for seniors. The evidence doesn’t suggest that’s the case. ‘Structural changes’ The NRSC told PolitiFact Florida that Murphy had said as much in a CNN interview on Jan. 2, 2013 — the day before he started his first term in the U.S. House of Representatives. CNN anchor Ashleigh Banfield asked Murphy what he was prepared to do to find common ground in a partisan Congress that had begrudgingly reached a compromise over budget negotiations — a situation usually referred to as the ""fiscal cliff."" The House had passed a bipartisan agreement on Jan. 1 that fended off big income tax increases on most Americans and prevented huge cuts in defense spending and other programs. In the interview, Murphy said he wanted to help the House make ""big choices"" to move ahead without similar battles in the future. When Banfield asked him what those choices were, he said he didn’t think Congress should continue to delay action on passing a budget or shoring up benefits programs. ""Unfortunately, we have to look at cuts across the board,"" he said. ""We're going to have to look at defense. We're going to have to look at some structural changes to some programs like Social Security and Medicare."" He went on to say he wanted to eliminate ""fraud, waste and abuse."" He said he thought his CPA training would be helpful in going through the budget to find the best places to cut. Later in the interview, Banfield asked Murphy if he would break away from his party on any issue during negotiations, and where he thought Congress could make ""painful cuts"" if needed. ""You know, I think we're going to have to make some structural changes to programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,"" he answered. ""We're going to have to make sure they're sustainable for years to come."" The NRSC did not provide any more evidence of Murphy’s position on Social Security and Medicare. Murphy’s primary opponent in this year’s Senate race, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, had used this same line of attack, editing the quote to, ""We have to look at cuts across the board, uh, to some programs like Social Security and Medicare."" But in full context, Murphy said ""structural changes,"" which is not the same as cuts. We couldn’t find any clear evidence that Murphy had voted for or advanced any legislation that would have cut the programs. His campaign told us Murphy was referring to raising the taxable income limit for the payroll tax, and allowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over drug prices. There are some examples of Murphy wanting to prevent cuts to the programs. On Murphy’s 2012 campaign website — archived on the Wayback Machine — he vowed to protect both Social Security and Medicare. He said he would fight attempts to privatize Social Security and cut the program, and oppose moving Medicare patients to the open market. Three weeks after joining the House, Murphy offered a motion to change a debt ceiling bill in order to prevent future benefit changes for seniors and veterans. The failed motion sought to keep Congress from changing Medicare to a voucher plan and privatizing Social Security in 2014 budget negotiations. He subsequently made similar actions through his term, although many of them failed in the Republican-led House. In August 2014, Murphy spoke out about increasing the taxable income limit for the payroll tax, which was $117,000. Income above that threshold is not subject to the payroll tax that funds Social Security. Taxing income above that would bring more money into the program. ""If you’re going to be honest about addressing Social Security you have to, I think, take a broad approach to it and look at all options. That is the easiest option, raising that cap to a larger number,"" Murphy said. He signed onto a bipartisan letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in March 2015, asking the agency to abandon proposed cuts to Medicare Advantage. CMS decided to increase Medicare Advantage payments instead. Our ruling The National Republican Senatorial Committee said Murphy advocated for ""cuts to Social Security and Medicare."" The attack focused on one interview from before Murphy officially joined Congress. While Murphy said cuts were possible, he pointed out Congress will need to focus on ""structural changes"" to the two programs. Murphy’s efforts to protect Social Security and Medicare have focused on protecting seniors and veterans, but we didn’t find any clear evidence he has endorsed or voted for legislation to cut current or future benefits.

Republican group misleads in attack on Patrick Murphy's resume
","The National Republican Senatorial Committee says it’s fact-checking U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy’s resume as a certified public accountant and small business owner. Murphy, a Jupiter Democrat, is running against incumbent Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. The NRSC’s TV ad  begins with a video clip of Murphy saying in 2012, ""I believe that my background as a CPA and a small business owner is exactly what we need."" The narrator then reads lines from a CBS4 Miami report and says, ""Never worked as a CPA,"" and ""Never a small business owner."" Did Murphy distort his work experience? We heard similar attacks against Murphy during the primary, and wrote a guide to attacks on Murphy’s resume. There are a lot of nuances to how Murphy has characterized his work experience, and the TV ad makes it sound clear cut. It’s not. 'Never worked as a CPA?' Murphy did work as a CPA. But he first held a lesser title and then worked as a CPA for less than a year. Murphy started at Deloitte in Miami 2007 as an ""audit assistant.""  He applied for his CPA license from Colorado in 2009; at the time Colorado required fewer semester credits than Florida. After he obtained the license in September 2009, he was promoted to ""audit senior."" He left in May 2010. To get the license, Murphy took a test through the state of Vermont. (The exam is the same everywhere, so he didn’t have to travel to Vermont to take it.) CBS4 reported that Murphy ""never worked a day in his life as a Certified Public Accountant."" This is a matter of semantics: He did work while a CPA for several months at Deloitte, but he worked in Florida while holding a Colorado CPA license. Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida, previously told PolitiFact Florida that Murphy’s path -- starting as an audit assistant at Deloitte, taking the CPA test and getting licensed in another state and then being promoted -- would have been common. Many new hires at firms such as Deloitte have not passed the CPA exam. These non-CPA assistants can’t sign audit opinions or tax returns; however, they do audit work without having a CPA license from any state, McGill said. ""Bottom line: He can fully work as an audit assistant or even audit senior or manager in for Deloitte in Miami without being licensed in Florida (or anywhere),"" McGill said. ""It only becomes critical to have the Florida license if he becomes a partner."" Murphy was promoted to ""audit senior"" after obtaining his license. ""They are the boots on the ground doing the actual work,"" he said. Murphy acknowledged in a 2012 debate that his CPA license was from Colorado after his Republican rival, U.S. Rep. Allen West, accused him of misleading voters about his credentials. ""I am a certified public accountant in the state of Colorado,"" Murphy said. ""I never hid that."" Murphy’s 2016 campaign website said that after college, he ""went on to work as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) for Deloitte and Touche, auditing Fortune 500 companies."" A Murphy spokesman referred to an article by the Sun Sentinel which quoted a former supervisor of Murphy’s at Deloitte from 2007 to 2009. She gave $250 to his campaign in 2011. ""Patrick is a licensed CPA who did valued accounting work in Florida,"" Courtney Connolly told the Sentinel. 'Never a small business owner' Murphy was a small business owner. But the business was owned by multiple people and grew out of a business owned by his father. The business was Coastal Environmental Services, a company formed to clean up the Gulf oil spill. Ultimately the firm only did work in the Gulf for a few months. In 2010, Murphy, his father Thomas P. Murphy Jr. and Dan Whiteman incorporated Coastal Environmental Services. The elder Murphy owns the affiliated Coastal Construction, and Whiteman was listed as the president of both firms. Annual reports show Patrick Murphy was a director in 2011 and 2012. Once elected to Congress, he remained an owner but no longer a director. State records don’t show if someone is an ""owner,"" and Murphy hasn’t said if he financed the firm. By ""owner"" Murphy presumably meant that he had an economic interest, University of Florida corporate law professor Stuart Cohn previously told PolitiFact Florida. ""Records filed with the state do not require listing those who had such an economic interest, whether as a shareholder or otherwise,"" Cohn said. ""So, it is not possible from the state records to determine who owned what economic interests and in what percentages."" The Murphy campaign shared an IRS document with PolitiFact Florida that showed that Murphy, his father and Whiteman were shareholders in 2010. (The campaign blacked out the percentage each owned, as well as the names of three additional shareholders.) Whiteman previously told PolitiFact Florida that as vice president Murphy ""managed the company’s affairs."" ""It's typical for business partners to have multiple ventures together, so it’s not unusual for some of the owners of Coastal Construction to also be owners of Coastal Environmental,"" Whiteman said. Most of Murphy’s annual congressional financial disclosures do not mention his position with Coastal Environmental. In 2015, he amended his 2012 form to show that he was the firm’s vice president. In 2013, 2014 and 2015 he doesn’t list the firm at all. The company has been dormant since 2010, so it hasn't generated any income and doesn't need to be reported as an asset on the forms, said Joshua Karp, Murphy’s campaign spokesman. Our ruling The NRSC ad says Murphy ""never worked as a CPA"" and was ""never a small business owner."" Murphy did work as a CPA, albeit for only several months. He first worked as an audit assistant, and then got licensed through the state of Colorado. Murphy has been an owner of Coastal Environmental Services. The firm only did work in the Gulf for a few months in 2010 and has since been dormant. Since it is a private business, we lack some information about it such as whether he put up any money to finance the business. He was a co-owner along with his father. In both cases, the word ""never"" is too extreme to characterize Murphy’s work experience. However, in both cases we are talking about Murphy working for brief periods of time. Murphy may be overselling his resume, but the ad also exaggerates when it says ""never."" We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/sep/08/national-republican-senatorial-committee/republican-group-misleads-attack-patrick-murphys-r/

Did Vladimir Putin call Trump 'brilliant'?
","Donald Trump defended his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin during NBC’s Commander-in-Chief Forum, claiming he was only returning the favor. NBC host Matt Lauer listed some of the things Trump and Putin have said about each other, and asked if Trump wants admiration from someone who is at odds with U.S. foreign policy and may be meddling with the election. ""You said, ‘I will tell you, in terms of leadership, he’s getting an A, our president is not doing so well. And when referring to a comment that Putin made about you, I think he called you a brilliant leader, you said, ‘It’s always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his country and beyond,’ "" Lauer said. ""But do you want to be complimented by that former KBG officer?"" ""Well, I think when he calls me brilliant, I’ll take the compliment, OK?"" Trump said, ""The fact is, look, it’s not going to get him anywhere. I’m a negotiator."" While Lauer and Trump both claimed that Putin called Trump ""brilliant"" during the forum, we are putting Trump’s statement on the Truth-O-Meter. It’s not the first time Trump has brought up the ""really nice things"" Putin has said about him. ""He called me a genius,"" Trump said of Putin at two campaign events in February, three times in April, in a May interview on CNN, at a June rally in California, twice in July, and at an August town hall in Ohio Trump has been referring to comments Putin made in December 2015, when asked for his thoughts of the billionaire by an ABC reporter. ""He’s a very colorful person. Talented, without any doubt, but it’s not our affair to determine our worthiness — that’s up to the United States voters. But he is absolutely the leader in the presidential race,"" reads the captions on the ABC video. The Russian president’s words got lost in translation in some corners of the American press. CNN, Buzzfeed, the Washington Examiner, the New York Post, The Hill all quoted Putin calling Trump ""brilliant and talented."" Translations from British and Russian media outlets, meanwhile, were closer to the original ABC video. Reuters reported that Putin called Trump ""very flamboyant, very talented."" The BBC interpreted the comments as ""very colorful, talented.""  And The Guardian amended a previous version of its article from ""brilliant"" to ""very colorful."" RT, the television network funded by the Russian government, quoted Putin as saying ""very flamboyant."" And according to Sputnik, a news agency also controlled by the Kremlin, Putin said ""very bright."" What accounts for these different interpretations? The word Putin used was ""яркий"" or ""yarkii,"" which means ""bright"" or ""brilliant."" But whereas ""bright"" and ""brilliant"" in English are synonyms for both ""vivid"" and ""intelligent,"" the Russian word ""yarkii"" does not carry the second meaning. Putin was basically using ""yarkii"" to mean ""colorful"" or ""strong personality,"" said Harley Balzer, a Russia expert at Georgetown University, adding that he sees ""nothing to support ‘brilliant’"" in the intelligence sense from the comments Putin made in December. Russian language experts told our friends at FactCheck.Org the same thing. Putin, himself, denied the ""brilliant"" translation in a June interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria. ""You made some comments about the American Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump. You called him ‘brilliant,’ ‘outstanding,’ ‘talented,’ "" Zakaria said. ""These comments were reported around the world. I was wondering what in him led you to that judgment and do you still hold that judgment?"" ""Why do you always change the meaning of what I said?""

Heard the one about Ted Strickland and 89 cents?
","Ads against Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland are torpedoing Ohio airwaves, even as reports say that supporters of incumbent Sen. Rob Portman are scaling back their spending. One claim that has been repeated across multiple ads is about a handful of change: 89 cents, to be exact. ""Eighty-nine cents,"" reads the script from the ad, paid for by the US Chamber of Commerce’s political action arm. ""You can find that in your couch. Or your jeans. Or even under your floor mats. But as governor, Ted Strickland left only 89 cents in Ohio’s rainy day fund."" It seems unlikely that so specific a number would be used without factual underpinning. We wanted to be sure it checked out. It does. In official-speak, Ohio’s rainy day fund is known as the Budget Stabilization Fund. When Strickland left office in January 2011, the fund had bottomed out to $0.89. Here’s a chart using data from Ohio’s Office of Management and Budget. It shows the ebb and flow of Ohio’s reserves, including the low point in fiscal years 2009 and 2010.  Where’d the reserves go? Stickland used $1 billion from the fund to balance the state budget in 2009, a move he and his campaign have defended. ""I would not have had a rainy-day fund if I had listened to many Republicans,"" Stickland said in 2009. ""I'm glad I held on to it. There is justification for it now."" Kim Rueben, a state and local finance expert at the Urban Institute, told Columbus Business First that, ""I wouldn’t blame a governor for spending budget stability funds in a time when you need to stabilize your budget.""  Yet the tiny reserve became a bit of Ohio lore. Brian Perera, the Ohio Senate’s former deputy chief of staff for budget and finance, even cut a check for $0.89 so he can say he personally doubled the state’s reserves. The reserve has grown since Strickland left office. Current Gov. John Kasich started to replenish the rainy day fund with a injection of $246.9 million in July 2011. The money came at the tail end of Strickland's final two-year budget even though he had left office.  Today, the rainy day fund sits at over $2 billion, according to the state. Our ruling Campaign ads criticized Strickland for leaving Ohio’s rainy day fund at $.89 when he left office as governor. Strickland’s defenders say the recession that hit the United States and Ohio required Strickland and state officials to drain the $1 billion fund. And they note the fund started to be replenished at the tail-end of his final budget, even though Strickland had left office. But we don't think that affects the accuracy of this claim. We rate it True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2ce48995-a59a-4079-94eb-6d03717ebdf6",/factchecks/2016/sep/08/us-chamber-commerce/heard-one-about-ted-strickland-and-89-cents/

Was Colin Van Ostern the deciding vote for Medicaid expansion in NH?
","New Hampshire’s next governor will have a say in whether the state continues its Medicaid expansion program, which covers nearly 50,000 low-income residents and is set to expire in 2018. Executive Councilor Colin Van Ostern pledges to support the program, and touts his background on the subject as proof. ""As a member of the Executive Council, I cast the deciding vote to extend Medicaid coverage to 50,000 people,"" Van Ostern wrote in a mailer sent to voters recently, a point he has repeated on the campaign trail. ""I cast the deciding vote extending Medicaid health care coverage to 50,000 of our fellow citizens,"" Van Ostern said in a WMUR debate the week before the primary. Was Van Ostern the program’s savior? We decided to take a look. New Hampshire’s Legislature approved a bill in 2014 to expand Medicaid for roughly two years to cover low-income adults making less than 138 percent of the poverty level. Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan signed the expansion, also known as New Hampshire Health Protection Program, into law that March. As an Executive Councilor, Van Ostern had no participation in that pivotal vote. Many credited Republican leaders in the House and Senate for the vote because a few broke from their party and sided with Democrats in favor of expansion. The Executive Council had a say on the program later that year, when the Department of Health and Human Services brought forward a $292 million contract amendment to pay for and implement expanded Medicaid. The five-member council is in charge of approving state agency contracts that exceed $25,000. The council in 2014 was made up of three Democrats and two Republicans. Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan, who presides over the council, urged members to pass the agreement. When she called the roll, all three Democrats voted by voice vote for the contract. The two Republicans opposed it. Was Van Ostern the deciding vote? Not really. Campaign spokesman Matt Trojan said without Van Ostern’s support, Medicaid expansion wouldn’t have passed. But that’s not entirely accurate. The council’s vote was on a contract that allowed the two health care providers to move forward with the program that had already been approved in law. At the time, Van Ostern himself said it was already a done-deal. ""There are legitimate policy disagreements, but this has been decided. This has been through the legislative process,"" Van Ostern said.   And the ""deciding vote"" argument is even more dubious. The claim has typically been used as an attack against Democrats who voted in favor of the Affordable Care Act, including New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. In that case all 60 Democratic votes -- including Shaheen’s -- were needed to pass the measure through the Senate. However, Shaheen, unlike others, was hardly a holdout until the last minute; she gave indications early on that she supported the president’s reform plan. Those claims were typically rated Mostly False.   By the same token, the other two Democrats on the Executive Council have equal claim to the deciding vote title. Generally, calling someone ""the deciding vote"" implies he or she played a pivotal role, such as withholding support or opposition until the last moment. Expanded Medicaid received strong support among Democrats, and as the council’s controlling party, the contract wasn’t expected to fail. Before the vote, Van Ostern and another Democrat both stated they planned to support the agreement. Our ruling Executive Councilor and candidate for governor Colin Van Ostern said he ""cast the deciding vote to extend Medicaid coverage to 50,000 people."" The Executive Council voted in favor of the contract that allowed expanded Medicaid to go forward, but the vote to approve the program already passed the legislature with bipartisan support. Van Ostern was one of three Democrats who voted for the contract and stated his support ahead of time. Since he did not have a direct vote on the law, and didn’t change his position, we rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/sep/08/colin-van-ostern/was-colin-van-ostern-deciding-vote-medicaid-expans/

NARAL misleads in attack on Marco Rubio about Zika funding
","As the number of Floridians infected with the Zika virus continues to escalate, political groups and and candidates have lobbed attacks in the U.S. Senate battle in Florida. NARAL Pro-Choice America, a liberal organization that supports abortion rights, attacked Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s record on Zika in an ad airing on TV in Orlando and West Palm Beach and online. NARAL endorsed Rubio’s opponent, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter. ""The Zika virus is here. It’s dangerous to pregnant women. And it has no cure. But Marco Rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency,"" states the narrator while text states that Rubio ""voted against contraception and family planning."" The narrator then continues: ""And Marco Rubio continues to be against a woman's right to choose an abortion even if they are infected with the Zika virus."" The ad shows video of someone clad in protective gear spraying for mosquitoes and anxious looking women including one who is pregnant. The ad began airing as Congress returned from recess to debate Zika funding again. On Sept. 6, a Senate bill failed to receive the necessary votes to move forward. We will zero in on Rubio’s votes related to Zika. Rubio’s voting record and public statements about Zika show that he has repeatedly shown support for Zika funding requests, including by President Barack Obama. The ad is referring to Rubio’s votes in favor of Zika legislation that would have cut funding to one organization in Puerto Rico, an affiliate of Planned Parenthood. Zika bills In February, Obama requested $1.9 billion for vaccine research, testing and mosquito control related to Zika. Rubio announced his support for Obama’s request at a press conference in Miami April 8. A timeline from Rubio’s office states he was the first congressional Republican to announce his support. Since that time, Rubio has repeatedly called on his colleagues in floor speeches, media outlets and press conferences to pass a bill. On May 12, Rubio and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla, announced they would introduce legislation to provide the full $1.9 billion request. ""There's no reason every proposal to address Zika cannot be bipartisan and earn broad support, and I'm hopeful we can reach a final outcome that fully addresses the problem,"" Rubio said at the time. On May 17, Rubio voted with the majority, 68-29, for a motion on an amendment by  Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., to provide $1.1 billion to combat Zika. Rubio reluctantly voted for the compromise measure while still calling for Obama’s full funding request. Two days later, the Senate passed the full bill 89-8 with Rubio voting with the majority. The bill called for spending $1.1 billion to prevent, prepare and respond to the Zika virus domestically and internationally including on the development of a vaccine. House and Senate negotiators then got together in a conference committee. Republicans added a clause to block any money for Profamilias, the Puerto Rican branch of Planned Parenthood. The services of that family planning agency are relevant here because Zika can be transmitted through sex, and condoms can reduce the chance of getting Zika. Profamilias served 8,000 people in 2015. Democrats saw that as a ""poison pill"" intended to doom the bill, while Republicans said Democrats were refusing to compromise. While the bill would have blocked funding for Profamilias, it would not have blocked funding for Puerto Rico entirely. The ad omits that the bill provided funds that would potentially help clinics and hospitals in nearly every municipality on the island. Puerto Rico has 20 community health centers operating at 84 sites. Profamilias has seven clinics on the island, and in each area there is another type of facility that would have been eligible for Zika funding. The ad cites two Rubio votes in June on the appropriations bill that included the $1.1 billion for Zika. The first vote, on June 14, was a motion to proceed and passed 94-3. So NARAL is attacking Rubio for voting in favor of something that was supported by virtually every senator of both parties. The second vote was on June 28 when the Senate voted 52-48 to bring up the Zika measure. It failed to reach the 60-vote threshold, so the underlying bill didn’t reach an up or down vote. Rubio voted for the measure. ""Shame on Washington for failing to pass Zika funding,"" Rubio said after the bill died. ""We’ve been on top of this issue for five months, and it’s a failure of both parties in this town, including the president of the United States, that it’s taken this long to even get to this point."" One final note about the ad’s attack on Rubio for opposing abortion, including for women with Zika. Rubio told Politico in August: ""I believe all human life should be protected by our law, irrespective of the circumstances or condition of that life."" Our ruling NARAL’s TV ad said, ""Marco Rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency (Zika)."" The text on the screen stated that Rubio ""voted against contraception and family planning."" The ad creates a misleading impression that Rubio’s votes show he is indifferent to funding clinics to combat Zika. Actually, he has repeatedly supported Zika funding requests, including $1.9 billion sought by Obama. The ad cherry-picks votes by zeroing in on Rubio’s votes on measures that would have blocked funding to the Planned Parenthood affiliate in Puerto Rico. The ad doesn’t explain that despite that block, the bill still could have provided money to fight Zika both in Puerto Rico and the United States. Nothing passed due to the gridlock over that issue. As for the statement about Rubio’s voting record, we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/sep/08/naral-pro-choice/naral-misleads-attack-marco-rubio-about-zika-fundi/

Hillary Clinton says Trump supported intervention in Libya
","When it comes to national security, Republican Donald Trump casts Democrat Hillary Clinton as too ready to take the country into war. One of his prime examples -- Clinton’s full-throated support for the attacks that toppled Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi. But in a NBC News forum focused on the role of the commander-in-chief, Clinton deflected that criticism. She said there was no difference between herself and Trump on the Libyan action. ""He's on record extensively supporting intervention in Libya, when Gadhafi was threatening to massacre his population,"" Clinton said Sept. 7, 2016. Did Trump endorse the attacks to unseat Libya’s then-leader, Moammar Gadhafi? The record shows he did. Early in 2011, before the United States joined a NATO force to oust Gadhafi, Trump argued for American action. We know what Trump thought back then thanks to a video on Trump’s own video blog (credit to BuzzFeed for spotting it) ""I can’t believe what our country is doing,"" Trump said, according to the BuzzFeed transcript. ""Gadhafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we’re sitting around. We have soldiers all over the Middle East, and we’re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that’s what it is: It’s a carnage."" Trump continued. ""You talk about things that have happened in history; this could be one of the worst,"" he said. ""Now we should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and save these lives. This is absolutely nuts. We don’t want to get involved and you’re gonna end up with something like you’ve never seen before."" And then ... ""But we have go in to save these lives; these people are being slaughtered like animals,"" Trump said. ""It’s horrible what’s going on; it has to be stopped. We should do on a humanitarian basis, immediately go into Libya, knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively, and save the lives."" Trump offered a more mixed assessment on CNN after the attacks began. His primary concern was with the political leanings of the forces opposing Gadhafi. ""I do really want to know who these people we're fighting for, who they are,"" Trump said on March 28, 2011. ""I hear they are aligned with Iran. I hear they may be aligned with al-Qaida."" But Trump still said, ""At this point, if you don't get rid of Gadhafi, it's a major, major black eye for this country."" Our ruling Clinton said Trump is on record ""extensively"" supporting the attacks that unseated Libya’s Gadhafi. We actually didn’t find that many comments from Trump about Libya. But when he did speak, he was emphatic. In 2011, before the first bombing runs, Trump said, ""We should go in, we should stop this guy."" Even when he voiced concern over who would run Libya post-Gadhafi, he supported the intervention.

Hillary Clinton says none of her emails had classification headers
","During an NBC forum that focused on the presidential candidates’ national security chops, host Matt Lauer asked Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton why it isn’t disqualifying that she dealt with highly sensitive material on a private, unclassified email system. Clinton said she made a mistake using the system, but she still took classification seriously. ""I have a lot of experience dealing with classified material, starting when I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee going into the four years as secretary of state,"" she said. ""Classified material has a header which says ‘top secret, secret, confidential.’ Nothing, and I will repeat this, and this is verified in the report by the Department of Justice, none of the emails sent or received by me had such a header."" Given that we’ve found Clinton’s email did contain some classified information, this statement intrigued us. Information isn’t classified until a designated authority within the government declares it classified. The way that person shows their determination is by adding a header and footer to the relevant document, often tacking on a cover sheet, too — all to make it clear that the document contains classified information. Clinton is correct that the FBI did not find any such labels in her emails. Of the tens of thousands of emails the FBI reviewed, 81 email chains found on Clinton’s private servers included classified information, as determined by various U.S. intelligence agencies, according to a FBI report released Sept. 2. Just three email chains included some sort of classification marking: At least one paragraph preceded by the marking ""(C),"" indicating that those paragraphs were ""confidential,"" the lowest level of classification. But none of the three had a header, footer or cover page further signaling that the emails contained confidential information. Even though there was a ""(C)"" preceding the paragraphs, this information was not properly marked confidential because it did not include the header, FBI Director James Comey said in a July 7 hearing before Congress. It’s ""reasonable,"" he said, that Clinton may not have realized these were classified. For Clinton’s part, she told the FBI that ""she did not know what the ""(C)"" meant at the beginning of the paragraphs and speculated it was referencing paragraphs marked in alphabetical order,"" according to the bureau’s report. She also disputed the need for these particular paragraphs to be classified at all. So that’s three email chains out of 81 found to include classified information on Clinton’s private email server. What about the other 78? Clinton, in her statement, said classified material has a header that says ""classified"" and that none her emails had that header. But that leaves out the possibility of what happened in this case — classified information is left unlabeled as a result of human error. All information determined to be classified should have a header in order to designate it properly. But if someone makes a mistake and forgets to include the label after that original determination, the information is still classified. ""In that case, the information was classified, but in the absence of markings, the person receiving the information may have no realistic way of knowing that fact,"" said Liza Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice. "" ‘Classified’ isn’t an inherent or self-evident status. It’s an act,"" she said. ""And that act is rather meaningless if not conveyed to others."" Comey has said it’s understandable that Clinton did not realize some of this unmarked information was classified. But he also has said she should have recognized by the topic of discussion that some of these emails did not belong on a non-classified system, given that 36 of these email chains had ""secret"" information and eight had ""top secret"" information. ""There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about the matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation,"" Comey said in a July 5 statement. For example, some of these email discussions touched on the CIA’s drone program. Members of Clinton’s staff told the FBI that some of this supposedly classified drone-related information had already been revealed to the public in news reports. Clinton regularly dealt with classified information as secretary of state. She has said she viewed classified information in hard copy in her office, and she used other secure channels when traveling. Some emails now made public actually show Clinton’s team discussing how they couldn’t email each other classified information over the private server and instead had to move the conversation to a more appropriate venue. In the end, Comey said the Justice Department shouldn’t prosecute Clinton because there isn’t enough evidence that she intentionally mishandled classified information, nor did investigators find vast quantities of exposed classified material. Many transparency experts say the government regularly over-classifies, such as classifying information that wouldn’t actually damage national security if released. That’s likely the case regarding Clinton’s emails, said Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University, which favors less classification. ""The point is there's no objective standard for classification,"" Blanton said. ""Very little of what's classified would be deemed so by all experienced observers."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""Classified material has a header which says ‘top secret, secret, confidential.’ Nothing, and I will repeat this, and this is verified in the reports by the Department of Justice, none of the emails sent or received by me had such a header."" For information to be considered properly marked classified, it must contain a header. Clinton is correct that nothing in her email had a header signifying its classification status. Three email chains had a ""(C)"" indicating ""confidential"" information, but that is not enough to consider the emails properly marked classified. But that doesn’t mean there wasn’t any classified information in her email. If someone has determined information to be classified, it is still technically classified even if someone neglects to label it down the line. The FBI found 81 email chains that contained information determined to be classified, though none of the information was appropriately labeled, so it wasn’t necessarily obvious to the recipients. Clinton’s carefully worded statement is accurate but needs additional information. For that, we rate her claim Mostly True.

The fact-check has been revised to include the definition of Mostly True.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/324a3685-89b0-4e34-b615-3f63b26d7168",/factchecks/2016/sep/08/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-none-her-emails-were-labeled-top-secr/

Conspiracy linking Milwaukee police with alleged sex trafficking house conspiracy is unfounded
","More than a month after a crowd of people set fire to a Milwaukee home they believed was a sex trafficking hub, conspiracy theories continue to surround a chaotic and confusing series of events. But those theories are no truer now than they were at the time. An array of claims stemming from the brief disappearance of two teenage girls in late June 2020 have made the rounds on social media accounts and in Reddit forums. A June 28, 2020 Facebook post — which features an image of a tweet — packs many of them together. The post has generated more than 20,000 likes, though that’s a fraction of how many times it has been seen. Here is what it reads: ""Are we just not going to talk about the fact Milwaukee police were caught on camera sneaking children into a van with masks over their face after a mother tracked her missing daughters phone to a registered sex offenders home & the cops were already there protecting the house ?!?!""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Let’s unpack this unfounded claim. According to a June 23, 2020 examination of what happened that day from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, two girls, ages 13 and 15, were last seen in the 2900 block of North 21st Street at around 5 p.m. June 21, 2020. They were reported missing four hours later. On June 22, 2020, police responded to the 2100 block of North 40th Street in reference to the report of the missing girls.  Milwaukee Police Department call logs show police twice went to the block that night — for a ""trouble with subject"" call and for a report of a threat. Police searched the house in question, but did not find the missing girls. The morning of June 23, 2020, a group of people congregated outside the home in question  after seeing social media posts about the house and the two missing girls. Many expressed frustration that police were not doing enough to locate the girls. Police were called to the house shortly after 10 a.m. after several people allegedly tried entering the home to look for the girls themselves. Police again searched the home and said later the girls were not located there -- just as they had not been the night before.  In a video that was live streamed to Facebook, Milwaukee community activist Vaun Mayes is heard saying that people were again trying to enter the house shortly before three or four gunshots were heard, followed by six more shots. Nobody was hurt in that exchange. Shortly after, the house was set on fire. More gunshots were eventually fired from the crowd, injuring a boy and girl, both 14 years old, police said. Police at the time noted no officers fired a gun during the incident, but they did use nonlethal munitions, including rubber bullets.  Another shooting was reported near the scene, and shortly before 12:30 a.m. on June, 24, 2020, the house was again set on fire.  It’s unclear when the two girls were found, but police said they were located by one of their mothers more than three miles from the house.  The two girls denied ever being at the 40th Street house and ever knowing anyone who lived there, police said. No evidence of human trafficking was discovered at the house. On July 28, 2020, a Milwaukee man was charged with arson and attempted arson. The June 28, 2020 Facebook post includes a number of parts to the claim, all of them off target. We’ll break it down piece-by-piece. ""Milwaukee police were caught on camera sneaking children into a van with masks over their face.""  A video posted to Reddit purports to show this happening.  In the video, a man is heard saying ""(police) pulled the van up to the door so they can sneak that s--- out."" The video, which is blurry, then shows a number of people leaving the house with colorful coverings over their heads as officers direct them into a vehicle.  It isn’t possible to determine how old the people are from the video. One person in a yellow head covering appears to be as tall as one of the officers. A subsequent person wearing pink appears to be half the size. In a statement to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Milwaukee Police said the people seen leaving the home with the officers ""were the residents who lived there"" and that they were removed after they heard people in the crowd threatening them.  Meanwhile, a woman who lived at the burned-out home told the Journal Sentinel on June 25, 2020 the people in the house ""had nothing to do with this."" ""A mother tracked her missing daughters phone to a registered sex offenders home.""  It is not entirely clear how the group ended up at the house. Many of the theories circling online echo this part of the claim. It is unclear if the mother was even at the house that morning, or how the house was identified. But the essential part of this piece of the claim is that it was the home of a registered sex offender. It was not.  A PolitiFact Wisconsin review of the Wisconsin Sex Offender Registry revealed no sex offenders listed at the house in question. One registered sex offender, however, was listed as living in a house next door.  ""The cops were already there protecting the house.""  This line takes nearly all the context out of the situation.  Police were originally called to the house on June 22, 2020 for a ""trouble with subject"" call and for a report of a threat.  They were again at the house at various points throughout the day June 23, 2020 after people allegedly tried to enter the house, shots were fired on the premises and the house was set on fire twice.  Police did establish a perimeter around the house. Officials told PolitiFact Wisconsin that was after someone in the house exchanged gunfire with a member of the crowd.  At another point, police had to escort firefighters toward the house while the crowd threw bricks and other projectiles, according to the Journal Sentinel report.  A June 28, 2020 Facebook postclaimed Milwaukee police were protecting a sex offender's house and snuck children out of it after a mom tracked her missing daughter to that address. The post spins a series of unfounded allegations into a conspiracy theory that simply does not hold water. We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2020/aug/03/facebook-posts/conspiracy-linking-milwaukee-police-alleged-sex-tr/

No, a CDC-WHO study does not prove that masks do not prevent spread of COVID-19
","As Americans argue over whether face coverings stop the spread of COVID-19, a video shared on Facebook makes a stark claim about masks and viruses generally. A 2020 study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, the video declares, ""proves face masks do not prevent the spread of a virus.""  The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) One of the study’s authors, University of Hong Kong public health professor Ben Cowling, told PolitiFact that the claim amounts to an ""incorrect interpretation"" of the study, ""confusing absence of evidence with evidence of absence."" Virologist Angela Rasmussen, a research scientist at Columbia University, said of the study cited in the video: ""The bottom line is that this paper doesn’t prove that face masks don’t prevent transmission, but that the available data didn’t show a statistically significant effect. ""The available data is incomplete and more studies need to be done to better understand whether masks are effective at reducing community transmission or not. That is why I continue to wear a mask in public places."" As we’ve reported, facial coverings are not in themselves totally effective in fighting the coronavirus, and there is a need for more study. But health officials largely agree that wearing any kind of face mask, coupled with social distancing and frequent hand-washing, is more protective than going unmasked.  The CDC generally recommends wearing masks in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and gas stations.  As the CDC puts it: ""Your cloth face covering may protect them. Their cloth face covering may protect you."" The 15-minute video was narrated and posted by Ben Swann, who describes himself as a ""journalist who speaks truth to power!"" Swann, who has 486,000 Facebook followers, runs TruthInMedia.com, which says it provides ""content focusing on issues that impact humanity."" The video was also shared the same day on YouTube by RT, a news network formerly known as Russia Today that is funded by the Russian Federation. In February 2018, YouTube began labeling state-funded posts and videos promoting conspiracy theories. The step was significant, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time, in part because YouTube has been a major conduit for RT, ""which U.S. intelligence officials called ‘the Kremlin’s principal international propaganda outlet.’"" The study cited in the video was conducted by researchers at the University of Hong Kong — not by the CDC and WHO, as the video claims — although there are affiliations. First published in February, the study appears in the May edition of Emerging Infectious Diseases, a peer-reviewed journal published by the CDC. The study says it was ""conducted in preparation for the development of guidelines by the World Health Organization on the use of nonpharmaceutical interventions for pandemic influenza in nonmedical settings,"" and was supported by the WHO. The CDC confirmed it did not participate in the study and would not comment on it, but a spokesman cited a separate CDC study published in July. It looked at clients exposed to two hair stylists who were symptomatic with confirmed COVID-19. Among 139 clients who wore face masks while the stylists also wore face masks, there were no symptomatic secondary cases reported. Among 67 clients who tested for COVID-19, all test results were negative. ""Adherence to the community’s and company’s face-covering policy likely mitigated spread of COVID-19,"" the study said. WHO did not provide comment before we published. The study cited in Swann’s video amounts to a review of research on personal protective equipment and influenza spread. It does not mention coronavirus or COVID-19.  After reviewing 10 studies on randomized and controlled trials that were published from 1946 to 2018, the study determined there was ""no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks."" That was regarding masks worn by infected persons or by persons in the general community. ""We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility,"" the researchers wrote. ""However, as with hand hygiene, face masks might be able to reduce the transmission of other infections and therefore have value in an influenza pandemic when healthcare resources are stretched."" Cowling, one of the study’s authors, told us that because COVID-19 spreads in similar ways as to influenza, the study findings should apply to COVID-19. But University of San Francisco research scientist Jeremy Howard cautioned that influenza and COVID-19 are different diseases, ""and we do not know whether evidence from influenza trials are relevant to COVID-19.""  The ""we did not find evidence"" phrase doesn't prove either that masks are effective or ineffective, Howard said. He added that it’s important to note that none of the 10 trials reviewed was done during a pandemic. Rasmussen reiterated that ""this was a systematic review of other published studies and it tells us much of what we already know: there’s not a good evidence base for masks outside of a healthcare setting, but there are still many knowledge gaps, especially regarding mechanisms of transmission.""  Texas A&M University-Texarkana virologist Ben Neuman said the study reflects the understanding of masks in the early phase of the pandemic, but scientific opinion has shifted because of several important papers published since then. ""The kicker is,"" he added, ""just weeks later, a group with the same senior author, plus some coronavirus specialists, produced a paper demonstrating that masks are indeed highly effective in stopping infected people from releasing airborne viruses."" The post claims a CDC study proved that masks do not prevent COVID-19. But it wasn’t a CDC study, and it didn’t ""prove"" that masks were ineffective. Scientists are still studying masks and the prevention of COVID-19. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/31/facebook-posts/no-cdc-who-study-does-not-prove-masks-do-not-preve/

Donald Trump draws false distinction between absentee, mail-in voting
","As many states prepare for increased mail voting due to the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump has repeatedly raised concerns about the voting process. He’s falsely suggested that there’s a difference between traditional absentee voting and states’ expanded mail voting, especially when it comes to verifying and securing votes. At a July 30 press briefing, Trump was asked about a tweet earlier that day in which he floated delaying the Nov. 3 election. That idea was quickly shot down by numerous Republican leaders as well as Democrats.  At the briefing, Trump repeated his objections to voting by mail. ""Absentee is different. Absentee, you have to work. You have to send in for applications. You have to go through a whole procedure,"" Trump said.  He went on to distinguish between his right to have a ballot delivered to him and the rights of the general public to cast votes via mail. ""For instance, I’m an absentee voter because I can’t be in Florida, because I’m in Washington,"" Trump said. ""I’m at the White House, so I’ll be an absentee voter. We have a lot of absentee voters, and it works. We’re in favor of absentee, but it’s much different than millions of people in California. They’re going to send out tens of millions of voting forms. Well, where are they going to go? You read where postmen are in big trouble now. You read where city councils are in big trouble now. Voter fraud all over the ballot."" Trump has made this point numerous times this summer. • June 25: ""Like, I'm in White House, and I have to vote in Florida, et cetera, et cetera. You're an absentee; that's okay. But people go through a process for that. ... But the mail-in ballots, they mail them to anybody. And they send them out by the millions. I think I read over 30 million ballots are going to be sent out in California."" • July 10: ""Absentee Ballots are fine because you have to go through a precise process to get your voting privilege. Not so with Mail-Ins."" • July 15: ""So absentee ballot: Great. Mail-in ballot: Absolutely no good. It makes no sense. A governor sends out millions of ballots all over the place; they don't know where they're going."" We have debunked Trump’s falsehoods about voter fraud and election rigging, including for mail-in ballots. Proven cases of non-citizens casting ballots are rare. For this fact-check, we will explain why absentee and mail-in ballots are the same thing, and that, whatever term you use, the verification process is the same. ""There’s really no distinction,"" said Darren Hutchinson, a law professor at the University of Florida and an elections expert. ""So, it’s basically a falsehood that’s been repeated over and over and over again.""  The coronavirus pandemic has raised concerns about voters’ safety as they wait in crowded polling places on Election Day — some may choose not to show up at all. Because of this, some states have encouraged the use of mail voting. (Five states had already run virtually all-mail elections: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washington.) In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law requiring counties to send all active registered voters a mail-in ballot about a month before the Nov. 3 election, joining the all-mail election states plus Vermont and Washington D.C. Other states are allowing voters to request those ballots, either online or by mail.  In the states that allow broad use of mail ballots, there is no distinction in how a voter requests ""absentee"" ballots and other types of mail ballots. Trump may not like the policy of sending out ballots to all registered voters, but it is wrong to suggest that ballots cast that way are different from absentee ballots or that they aren’t subject to the same scrutiny.  Part of the linguistic confusion may be generational: Many states have phased out the use of the term ""absentee,"" including California and Florida.  In 2016, for instance, the Florida Legislature unanimously voted to change the phrase ""absentee"" to ""vote-by-mail,"" in order to ease confusion among voters who mistakenly believed that they had to be away from home to request a ballot by mail. Some election advocates now use the term ""vote at home,"" because ballots in some states can be dropped off in person at designated lockboxes rather than mailed.  So when Trump says he’s an absentee voter in Florida because he’s ""at the White House,"" that’s not accurate. It doesn’t matter where he is; Trump, like any other registered Florida voter, can cast a ballot without going to an in-person site.  Regardless of the terminology, elections experts say there is no difference between how ""absentee"" and ""mail-in ballots"" are treated.  In 34 states and Washington, D.C., voters can use ""no excuse"" absentee voting, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Under no-excuse absentee voting, the voter does not need to attest that they will be out of the jurisdiction on Election Day, or that they cannot get to the polls because of an illness or disability.  There is no special process that absentee out-of-town voters go through that other mail-in voters do not, Hutchinson said.  The verification process actually begins well before any ballot is sent out. It starts with voter registration, a process which requires officials to determine if someone is eligible. Election offices also periodically update their registration lists, including removing inactive voters or those who have died. Many states are members of the Electronic Registration Information Center, which sends each member state reports showing voters who have moved within their state or out of state, have died or duplicate registrations.  Once a completed ballot is received by election officials, the identity of every voter is confirmed. In California, for instance, county elections officials check every vote-by-mail ballot to see whether the voter has already cast a ballot elsewhere. All ballot envelopes have unique barcodes, and local jurisdictions use specific paper types and watermarks for their ballots. Officials then compare the voter’s signature against the signature on the voter’s registration record.  ""Fundamentally, it’s the same thing,"" said Amber McReynolds, Denver’s former director of elections and chief executive officer of the National Vote at Home Institute. ""Ballots are handled exactly the same regardless of whether or not it's an absentee ballot or a vote-by-mail ballot."" States typically allow voters an opportunity to correct mistaken information they’ve filled in on their ballot, or if officials see too much of a discrepancy between the signature on file and the signature on the ballot. When voters are notified of any problems with their information on the envelope, they are able to fix the problem in time to have their ballot counted. Procedures to help voters track their ballots also helps with the verification process. For example voters in Palm Beach County, where Trump is a registered voter at Mar-A-Lago, can use the county website to track when the ballot was mailed to the voter and when it was received by the elections office. In Denver, voters can sign up to get information via text about their ballot, including when it was approved to be counted. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said July 31 the increase of mail ballots is the problem this cycle. ""Mass mail-out ballots are going to be more at risk of fraud,"" she said, citing multiple news reports about delays in tabulating results or rejection of mail ballots, including those that arrived after the deadline.  There have been delays in counting mail-in ballots, including in New York, and other problems including voters who said their requested ballots never arrived. All of those problems raise concerns about how some states that are unaccustomed to widespread voting by mail will gear up for the Nov. 3 election.  However, that doesn’t mean that there is any difference in verifying these votes. Trump said, ""Absentee is different (from mail-in ballots). Absentee, you have to work. You have to send in for applications. You have to go through a whole procedure."" There is no distinction between absentee voting and voting by mail. All mail ballots, regardless of how they are requested, are treated the same once they’re cast, and they require verification before being counted.

Viral image shows Caribbean statue unveiled in 2007, not original Statue of Liberty
","An image shared on Facebook falsely claims that the iconic sculpture overlooking New York Harbor is not the original Statue of Liberty. The post asserts that the original statue, which depicts a Black woman, was rejected by the U.S. and can currently be found on the island of St. Martin.  The image features a photo of what is purported to be the original Statue of Liberty: a sculpture of a Black woman raising a lantern. Text above the photo says: ""The first Statue of Liberty given to the US by France was a Black woman which the US rejected… France replaced it with the version currently in New York harbor. This Black Lady Liberty, also created by France, sits on the island of St. Martin…""  The statue in the photo is Lady Liberty on the island of St. Martin. While the text correctly identifies the statue’s location, this statue was actually installed in 2007 by sculptor Theodore Bonev, more than 120 years after President Grover Cleveland unveiled the U.S. Statue of Liberty. When Africa Check vetted a similar image, it found an article from a St. Martin newspaper that reported on the statue’s 2007 installation. Lady Liberty was built to mark the 159th anniversary of emancipation on the French side of the Caribbean island, and locals frequently celebrate the end of slavery at its base.  Edward Berenson, a professor of history at New York University and author of the book ""The Statue of Liberty: A Transatlantic Story,"" told PolitiFact in an email that he had seen the image many times and that it is erroneous.  ""It circulates regularly on the internet and social media. It's completely false,"" he wrote.  Berenson noted that rumors about a Black Statue of Liberty could have originated from plans that Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi, the Statue of Liberty’s designer, made for an earlier project. In the late 1860s, Bartholdi sketched a statue of an Egyptian woman that he was hoping to build at the southern end of the Suez Canal. When funding for the project fell through, Bartholdi abandoned his plans, but he later used the drawings as a jumping-off point for the Statue of Liberty, reworking the Egyptian woman into a classical Greco-Roman goddess of liberty.  Nothing in the historical record indicates that Bartholdi built a Black Statue of Liberty, only to have the U.S. reject it. But versions of the rumor date back at least as far as the late 1990s, before Lady Liberty was erected on St. Martin. In 1998, after receiving several inquiries about the claim, the National Park Service launched an exhaustive, two-year investigation into the Statue of Liberty’s history. Anthropologist Rebecca M. Joseph, who authored the report, wrote that ""there is no evidence that Bartholdi's ‘original’ design was perceived by white American supporters or the United States government as representing a black woman, or was changed on those grounds.""  In other words, the U.S. government gratefully accepted the only Statue of Liberty it was ever offered.  We rate this post False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/31/viral-image/viral-image-shows-caribbean-statue-unveiled-2007-n/

Facebook warnings of warrants for unemployment fraud lack evidence
","Widespread Facebook posts suggest that states are preparing to crack down on unemployment fraud. But the posts cite numbers that are more specific than what’s publicly available. ""Mississippi got 10,145 warrants for unemployment fraud!!"" said one Facebook post uploaded July 26 and since deleted. ""Y’all better make sure it ain’t you.""  The post and several others like it were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Nearly identical posts made related claims — and warned in some cases of the same exact number of issued warrants — about Georgia, Alabama and other places. Are the claims about Mississippi accurate? State officials have sounded the alarm about a rise in unemployment fraud as a lot more people seek unemployment assistance amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. But we did not find proof that the cited figure is accurate. Federal authorities have warned about fraud related to the flood of Americans filing for unemployment since the coronavirus outbreak. The FBI said in a July 6 statement that it had seen a ""spike"" in such cases ""involving the use of stolen personally identifiable information.""  ""Unemployment systems across the country are being attacked with false claims,"" said Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, in a June press conference. ""Mississippi’s certainly has been."" Reeves added: ""These are often sophisticated networks of criminal hackers who will take your information, apply for unemployment, and then reap your benefits.""  A U.S. Secret Service spokesperson confirmed that its divisions have identified criminal actors targeting state unemployment insurance program funds, and that they are working with financial institutions and state unemployment offices on leads.  But we found no evidence that 10,145 arrest warrants are out for fraud in Mississippi. The Secret Service and FBI declined to comment on the specific Facebook posts, and we did not hear back from the Justice Department. We searched Google and the Nexis news database for reports mentioning 10,145 warrants in Mississippi. We found nothing to substantiate the widespread Facebook claim. Jackie Turner, executive director of the state Department of Employment Security, said at the June press conference that the department has ""heard numerous complaints and reports of fraud."" Turner did not use a specific number. Dianne Bell, the department’s communications director, said the department is ""not aware of any Facebook posts on warrants for unemployment fraud for Mississippi."" Bell did not say whether the state had issued any — or 10,145 — warrants of any kind. The department warns on its website of social media accounts, websites and online surveys seeking confidential information or offering assistance with filing for unemployment payments. It encourages Mississippians to report fraud. The department also built an online system that gives employers information on employees who have filed for unemployment benefits. ""We are doing everything in our power on our end to prevent any fraudulent claims,"" said Reeves spokesperson Renae Eze.

What’s missing from Florida ‘5 times better’ claim on COVID-19 death rates
","A Facebook post that argues that Florida compares favorably with New Jersey and New York in the rate of COVID-19 deaths has a point. But it’s misleading, and there is much more to the story. ""This is a time-sensitive and difficult metric,"" Dr. Myron Cohen, an epidemiologist and director of Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, told PolitiFact.  ""You do not know the true denominator — death rate versus number of people infected — and you cannot see forward. Any discussions such as these lack proper context."" The July 26 post, from a Facebook user with more than 1.4 million followers, says: ""Despite all the fake, negative media hype, as of posting this the Covid death count per 1 million population: ""NJ: 1,787 NY: 1,680 Florida: 273 ""Florida is doing over 5 TIMES better in deaths, yet media tells the opposite story because they protect Democrats."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook user, saying the media highlights that Florida’s COVID-19 cases are surging, cited a table of Worldometer data. When we checked the site’s state data on July 29, we found that Florida’s death rate was one-sixth of New Jersey’s and New York’s. The same was true on other databases we checked, including one from Johns Hopkins University. But it’s a limited measure, bearing on a state that became a hotspot well after New York and New Jersey. Here’s what news reports said about Florida’s record-breaking coronavirus surge in the days before the post: Florida had the highest single-day total of new cases by any state, with more than 15,000 new infections. There were 872 deaths in one week, the highest weekly total in the Sunshine State during the outbreak. Florida was among the 21 states with outbreaks serious enough to place them in the ""red zone,"" according to a federal report. For a larger perspective, among the 20 countries currently most affected by COVID-19, the United States has the fourth-highest death rate per 100,000 people, behind the United Kingdom, Peru and Chile, according to Johns Hopkins University. Timing is a big reason why the statistic cited in the Facebook post is misleading. New Jersey and New York were hit hard early in the pandemic, and Florida was hit later. ""One has to wait until all is over to really see how ‘well’ states have been doing,"" Dr. Werner Bischoff, professor of infectious diseases at Wake Forest University, told PolitiFact. As of July 30, Florida recorded 988 COVID-19 deaths in the previous seven days, compared with 91 in New Jersey and 114 in New York, according to the New York Times. Death counts and rates are lagging indicators, which means they can confirm a trend after the fact, but can’t necessarily predict the course of the outbreak.  ""While cases started to increase exponentially in Florida in June, deaths only started to increase exponentially in July,"" Boston University global health professor Brooke Nichols told PolitiFact. ""The only way to compare these types of death rates meaningfully would be once we are several months after Florida’s first wave — and compare that to several months after the first wave in New York and New Jersey,"" she said. Nichols gave an example. On April 4, when the first wave of cases in New York peaked, the state had 237 deaths per 1 million population. Using July 16 as a peak in cases for Florida, the death rate was 223 deaths per million.  ""Those two numbers are eerily similar, and a foreshadow of what’s to come in Florida,"" Nichols said. The Facebook post said ""Florida is doing over 5 TIMES better in deaths"" than New York and New Jersey.

"['Census', 'Stacey Abrams']","
Fact-checking Stacey Abrams’ comparison of census response rates
","Stacey Abrams said President Donald Trump is trying to discourage immigrants from responding to the decennial census and said response rates so far were trailing rates from the 2010 census. Trump directed the commerce secretary, who oversees the census, to not count immigrants illegally in the country in the data used for the apportionment of U.S. House seats. Abrams said Trump’s directives would likely fail legal challenges, yet ""heighten the likelihood that the census will look whiter, which tends to mean the voting power is more Republican."" ""Right now, we are about 4% behind the response rate where we were in 2010. But for Black and Latino and Native American communities, they’re behind by 10%,"" Abrams said in a July 23 interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. We wondered if Abrams’ claim on the response rate was accurate. Her staff said the point she was making was that the national self-response rate was 4 percentage points behind the final self-response rate in 2010; and that during the 2020 census, Latino, Native American, and Black communities’ self-response rates are 10 percentage points lower than in white communities. We learned that it is not easy to compare this year’s census to the one in 2010. The U.S. Census Bureau told PolitiFact that shifts in timelines due to the coronavirus pandemic and different response methods prevent an accurate comparison of the 2010 and 2020 censuses. Households this year can answer the census questionnaire online, an option not available in 2010. The Census Bureau also does not break down response rates by demographics. Abrams’ claim is based on an analysis of self-response rates from the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York’s Graduate Center, said Lauren Zehyoue, communications director for Fair Count, a group created by Abrams to encourage census participation. There’s some data that can be used to gauge response rates in 2010 and 2020, but Abrams was imprecise in her wording, said Steven Romalewski, director of the CUNY Mapping Service, a project of the Center for Urban Research. Zehyoue told PolitiFact that Abrams was comparing the national response rate as of July 23, 2020, with the final response rate in 2010.  Using the final rate for comparison (and not the same date from 2010) is reasonable, Romalewski said, as ""that’s what all the census stakeholders are using as their reference point."" In 2010, the self-response operation ended April 30, and if there was no pandemic in 2020, it would have been more appropriate to compare exact dates in 2010 and 2020, he said.  Census Bureau data shows the 2010 response rate reached its highest point, 66.5%, on June 22, 2010. This year, on July 23, the national self-response rate was 62.4%. By this metric, Abrams’ point holds up, although she would have been more precise by saying we are behind ""about 4 percentage points,"" not 4%, Romalewski said. Self-response rates refer to households, not individuals. After the self-response phase ended in 2010, census takers went out knocking on doors and collecting information from households that had not responded. At this point, households could still mail their responses and not respond in person. The final 66.5% rate includes responses mailed back throughout that period.  The Census Bureau flagged a different number when we asked about the final response rate — 63.5% — referring to responses mailed back before census-takers went out. Overall, both metrics still support the argument that the rate in 2020 so far is behind 2010’s final rate, although it’s hard to do an apples-to-apples comparison, said Steve Jost, who was associate director for communications at the U.S. Census Bureau during the 2000 and 2010 censuses. Jost serves as an adviser to the Census Project, a coalition of organizations that support inclusive and accurate population counts. Another expert cautioned against making a comparison at all at this point.  Not everyone has access to the internet to respond online, enumerators have not been sent out nationwide because of the coronavirus, and the counting of people in group dwellings has become confusing as prisoners are being furloughed and students are kept off campuses, said Cynthia Buckley, a sociology professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and a Census enumerator. (The Census Bureau says college students should be counted where they live and sleep most of the time as of April 1. ""For most students, that means in their college town, not back home with their parents."") Zehyoue said this part of the claim was about the 2020 census and compared with white (non-Hispanic) households, not a comparison of response rates in 2020 and 2010. (In a July 22 MSNBC interview, Abrams also mentioned the 10% and said it was in comparison with ""white communities."") Zehyoue again cited the CUNY center’s analysis. The center examined patterns of response rates based on census-tract-level population characteristics, using the latest American Community Survey estimates (2014-18), to gauge how well communities with historically undercounted populations are self-responding in 2020 compared with other communities, Romalewski said. As of July 9, tracts with a plurality of white (non-Hispanic) households had a higher average response rate — at least 10 percentage points higher — compared with Black, Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native households, according to the center. ""It is pretty standard for minority communities to be classified as ‘hard to count,’ and they historically have had higher undercount rates than non-Hispanic whites,"" said Jennifer Van Hook, a professor of sociology and demography at Penn State University."" ""The big question is whether coverage for these groups will be especially low this year,"" she said. Abrams said, ""Right now, we are about 4% behind the response rate where we were in 2010. But for Black and Latino and Native American communities, they’re behind by 10%."" Abrams’ staff said her point was that the national self-response rate was 4 percentage points behind the final self-response rate in 2010; and in 2020, Latino, Native American and Black communities’ self-response rates are 10 percentage points lower than in white communities. There is one metric that supports Abrams’ point that the response rate this census is about 4 percentage points behind 2010’s and that the response from some communities trails those of mostly white (non-Hispanic) communities by at least 10 percentage points.  Still, the Census Bureau and other experts said it’s difficult or impractical to compare response rates in 2010 and 2020 for several reasons, including different timelines, additional ways to answer the questionnaire, and an ongoing pandemic.

The U.S. was one of the last countries to abolish slavery
","As the Black Lives Matter protests have continued over the past two months, there has been an influx of misinformation surrounding the group’s donations and goals. A recent Facebook post suggested that Black Lives Matter protestors don’t know America’s history with slavery. The post reads: ""Slavery used to be a normal throughout the world. America was the ONLY country that ended it! Black people owned slaves, too. White people were slaves, too. How many of these morons from black lives matter know that?!"" It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s address the main claim of this post first. ""America was the ONLY country that ended"" slavery The claim that ""America was the only country that ended"" slavery is inaccurate. Compared with some European countries and American territories, the United States was late to abolish slavery.  Mexico abolished slavery in 1829. The abolition of slavery was one of the reasons that white slave-holders in Texas rebelled and that the Republic of Texas re-instated slavery when it was formed in 1836. Though there was little documentation, historians estimate that at least 5,000 enslaved people escaped the United States and lived freely in Mexico.   Britain abolished slavery in its colonies in 1833. When the Slavery Abolition Act went into effect, it dismantled the structure of plantation slavery in the Caribbean colonies, but only freed enslaved people under the age of six in British North America. In modern Canada, enslaved people over the age of six were forced to be apprentices to slave owners for another four to six years.  France abolished slavery in 1848, after a 70-year period of abolishing and re-instating slavery in its colonies. Its former colony, Haiti, had already abolished slavery after the majority Black population won the Haitian Revolution in 1804.  Denmark abolished slavery in the Danish Colonies in 1848, 50 years after it had abolished the transatlantic slave trade in the West Indies. In 1847, the Danish government announced that all future children of enslaved people would be free and that slavery would be completely abolished by 1859. However, large scale slave rebellions in 1848 pressured Danish official Peter von Scholten to announce the abolition of slavery immediately. The United States didn’t officially abolish slavery until 1865 when the 13th Amendment passed Congress and was signed by President Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation freed enslaved people in the 11 Confederate states at war against the Union, and specifically applied to territory in those states that weren’t under Union control. It addressed only a small portion of the institution of slavery in the U.S., which could only be permanently abolished through a constitutional amendment.  Brazil was the last country in the Americas that relied on legal enslaved labor. The imperial government finally abolished slavery in 1888 after years of intense pressure from abolition organizations across the country. Other claims in the post The post also claimed that Black people owned slaves and that whites were enslaved as well.  While Black slave owners were not the norm, they definitely did exist. Using data from Carter G. Woodson’s research, historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. wrote that a total of ""3,776 free Negroes owned 12,907 slaves"" in 1830. To put that in perspective, free Black Americans owned about half a percentage point of the total 2,009,043 slaves owned in the United States in 1830, at almost the height of slavery in the United States. The claim that ""white people were slaves, too"" is false but has been circulating online since the early 2000s. While Irish immigrants may have endured harsh conditions as indentured servants, their servitude lasted for five to seven years, and they were not enslaved for life.  There are no historical accounts of ""white slaves."" Slavery in the United States was based on the chattel slavery of Black people with African heritage, meaning that enslaved Black people were treated like property and their children were also born into slavery. Mixed-race people were enslaved in America because of their African heritage, but they weren’t considered ""white slaves.""  Our ruling A Facebook post made many claims about slavery, and specifically said that ""America was the ONLY country that ended"" slavery. The United States was definitely not the only country that abolished slavery and was actually one of the last countries to abolish slavery in the Americas. Mexico, Britain, France, and Denmark had established freedom for enslaved people before the 13th Amendment was passed in 1865.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/31/facebook-posts/us-was-one-last-countries-abolish-slavery/

Wisconsin Democrats say lawmakers in neighboring states have done more on COVID-19 than state GOP
","Wisconsin’s response to the coronavirus outbreak is under a microscope as cases surge and Republicans and Democrats continue to clash over what -- if anything -- to do about the increase. Tensions boiled over July 30, 2020 after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers issued a statewide face mask mandate, despite opposition from Republicans who contend the move amounts to government overreach.  In the days before that, though, the state Senate’s Democratic Committee turned its frustration toward Republican lawmakers. ""While neighboring states like Minnesota, Illinois and Michigan have already implemented safety precautions like requiring individuals to wear masks, similar pleas in Wisconsin have fallen on deaf ears of Republican legislators,"" stated a July 24 news release. Lawmakers in those states have passed more COVID-19-related bills than Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled Legislature since the pandemic began. But some precautions, like a mask mandate, came from executive orders and not legislation.  How does the committee’s claim stack up? Eric LaGesse, executive director of the Senate’s Democratic committee, did not respond to PolitiFact Wisconsin’s request for evidence to back up their claim. But the claim is pretty straightforward, and there has been a lot of news coverage of the state’s response to the pandemic. Here’s a recap: In March, Evers and Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm issued a series of orders to curb large gatherings as COVID-19 began to emerge in Wisconsin. Those actions culminated in a stay-at-home order on March 24, 2020, which shut down the state to help contain the virus’ spread. In April, lawmakers passed a coronavirus relief package that allowed the state to tap into extra federal Medicaid dollars and suspended a one-week waiting period for collecting unemployment benefits, among other provisions. However, the state lost $25 million in federal funding for unemployment because Republican leaders waited too long to schedule a floor session on the relief package.  Evers’ administration extended the stay-at-home order on April 16 and four days later unveiled the Badger Bounce Back plan, which provided a phased approach for reopening based on testing and other public health criteria. In May, acting on a lawsuit from state GOP leaders, the state Supreme Court struck down much of the order and allowed the state to reopen without any protocols in place. After that, not much happened at the state level until the mask mandate despite a recent surge in infections and multiple daily increases of over 1,000 cases. Lawmakers have introduced 10 bills related to the pandemic in recent months, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The relief package we mentioned earlier is the only one that’s passed. The Democratic committee argued neighboring states -- specifically Illinois, Minnesota and Michigan -- have implemented more safety precautions for their residents. According to a database maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures, Minnesota enacted 25 pieces of legislation related to COVID-19 through July 23 after lawmakers introduced over 200 measures. Illinois has passed 18, and Michigan approved 19. The bills touch on a wide range of issues, from COVID-19 testing to election procedures. The differences between Wisconsin and its neighbors can’t be blamed on partisan gridlock, either. While Democrats control Illinois’ state government, Minnesota’s legislature is split between both parties with a Democrat in the governor’s office. Michigan, like Wisconsin, has a Democratic governor and a Republican-controlled legislature.  It’s worth noting, though, that some of the precautions in other states came about through executive orders by their governors, not action by the legislature. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzer, for example, issued an order on June 26 requiring residents to wear face coverings -- over a month before Evers enacted a mask mandate in Wisconsin.  Governors in other states also enacted stay-at-home orders similar to what Evers implemented. Wisconsin’s state Senate Democratic Committee claimed Republican lawmakers have failed to act while ""neighboring states like Minnesota, Illinois and Michigan have already implemented safety precautions like requiring individuals to wear masks."" It’s clear that Wisconsin lawmakers are behind the curve on COVID-19 compared to neighboring legislatures. Legislative bodies in Minnesota, Illinois and Michigan have introduced and passed more bills since the pandemic began.  But they didn’t act alone, and safety precautions like mask mandates were ordered by their governors.  That leaves us with a statement that’s accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

No, order doesn’t require masks in your house or walking your dog
","In a state Capitol where the response to COVID-19 — and pretty much everything else — splits along party lines, the response to Gov. Tony Evers’ July 30, 2020, statewide mask order was predictable. Republican lawmakers launched a flurry of news releases condemning the Democratic governor’s decision, although more than 30 states now require masks in some public spaces. Republicans successfully sued Evers in March over his stay-at-home order. In a July 30, 2020 news release titled ""Statement on statewide mask mandate,"" state Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine, said mask decisions should be made by businesses and individuals, not governments. ""I can understand why some businesses are requiring masks. That is their choice, just as it is my choice to do business elsewhere. That’s what America is about,"" he wrote. ""But no one is going to make me wear a mask in my house, or walking my dog. That is also what America is about – free choice."" Given the context, Wanggaard is suggesting the governor’s mandate requires masks while walking a dog or in one’s house. Just one problem. Evers’ order does neither of those. The July 30, 2020, mask order generally requires all Wisconsin residents to wear face coverings in public spaces indoors starting Aug. 1, through the end of September. The order lays out numerous exceptions, including children under age 5, people who are eating or sleeping, individual speakers making a presentation for an audience and people who are unable to wear a mask due to a medical condition. Violating the order could result in fines of up to $200. RELATED: Wisconsin GOP lawmaker misleads with claim that masks are ineffective against COVID-19 The core of the mandate is worded like this: Every individual, age five and older, in Wisconsin shall wear a face covering if both of the following apply: a. The individual is indoors or in an enclosed space, other than at a private residence; and; b. Another person or persons who are not members of individual's household or living unit are present in the same room or enclosed space. Face coverings are strongly recommended in all other settings, including outdoors when it is not possible to maintain physical distancing. The order earlier defines an ""enclosed space"" as a place open to the public, including outdoor bars, restaurants and park structures. Nothing there lines up with Wanggaard’s declaration about masks at home or walking his dog. The order explicitly refers only to indoor or enclosed spaces and notes private homes as an exception. Asked for evidence of Wanggaard’s claim, staffer Scott Kelly noted the City of Racine’s order would apply while walking a dog. It requires coverings within six feet of a non-family member in any outdoor space. But the news release was focused on the statewide order, not local ones. Wanggaard said he opposes statewide mask order because it would require him to ""wear a mask in my house, or walking my dog."" But an open outdoor area where a person would walk a dog isn’t within the requirements of the mandate, and the order has a specific exemption for private homes.

","As federal officers start to leave Portland, Ore., some onlookers say those officials were never associated with the federal government to begin with. Their evidence? A patch on the officers’ uniforms. ""Notice the ZTI patch on the uniform,"" reads text above an image of a camouflaged officer, which was published July 25 on Facebook. ""As in ZTI Solutions, a PRIVATE contractor. These guys are not ‘Feds,’ they’re Rent-A-Cops with riot gear."" ""Not cops Blackwater Mercenaries,"" the poster added in a caption. The image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar claims have been shared widely in liberal Facebook groups and pages. (Screenshot from Facebook) We reached out to the original poster for their evidence, but we haven’t heard back. We previously fact-checked whether federal agents detaining protesters in Portland are actually employees from Academi, a private military company formerly known as Blackwater. We rated that claim False. But what about ZTI? We took a closer look. There is no evidence that employees from ZTI Solutions, a small Virginia-based IT company, are patrolling demonstrations in Portland. The patch in the post actually reads ""ZT1"" — a unique identifier aimed at keeping the U.S. Marshal in the photo anonymous. Portlanders have been protesting against police brutality since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in late May. The demonstrations have sometimes turned violent, but the crowds are largely peaceful. The Department of Homeland Security sent federal agents to Portland as part of the federal government’s response to ongoing protests over police brutality. The forces are part of new ""rapid deployment teams"" that Homeland Security formed in response to an executive order from Trump that instructs federal agencies to provide ""personnel to assist with the protection of federal monuments, memorials, statues, or property."" The U.S. Marshals Service also has officials in Portland. The image in the Facebook post shows a U.S. Marshal. It was originally posted July 21 by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland, a freelance photographer in Portland. Please pay attention. Lives are going to be lost in Portland. pic.twitter.com/eNgFOr3OKF In a July 21 press conference, Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said federal agents in Portland don’t have names on their uniforms because some organizers have posted their personal information on the internet.  ""I, as the acting commissioner, have authorized and supported removing their names from the uniform. Instead what we have, though, is a personal identifier,"" he said. ""So we have that so we can identify, and we have each identifier associated with a specific name so we have all that information internally."" The example Morgan gave during the press conference was ""DZ1."" He also tweeted what the patches look like. Contrary to reports, @CBP personnel wear patches that identify them as:CBP ✔️Border Patrol ✔️Police ✔️Unique agent identifier ✔️ pic.twitter.com/YFgDs2NEPQ We reached out to the U.S. Marshals Service for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. ZTI Solutions, whose website appears to be down, is a small business founded in 1997 and based in Edinburg, Va. It provides ""consultative, engineering, and architecture services,"" according to an archived version of its website. We found no government contracts mentioning ZTI Solutions on the General Services Administration website. The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/30/facebook-posts/no-these-officers-portland-are-not-private-contrac/
