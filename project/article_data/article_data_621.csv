No, the Clintons and Bushes didn’t help assassinate JFK Jr.
","With the advent of the QAnon movement, John F. Kennedy Jr., the son of former President John F. Kennedy, has emerged as an unlikely 2024 vice presidential candidate. Some QAnon believers think the younger Kennedy, who died in a plane crash in 1999, is still alive. But other theories online suggest he was murdered.  ""According to a long-time Special Forces and CIA Division 4 operative’s explosive evidence, witness testimony and his team’s suppressed and classified final report named former presidents Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Senator Hillary Clinton among others as being involved in orchestrating the assassination of JFK Jr.,"" a June 19 Instagram post says.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While former President Kennedy was assassinated, there’s no evidence to support the claim that his son also was targeted and killed.  We’ve previously fact-checked many claims about JFK Jr., including that he was killed to make way for Hillary Clinton to become a New York state senator instead of him. That’s wrong, and so is the suggestion in this Instagram post that she and others helped to assassinate him.  On July 16, 1999, John F. Kennedy Jr., then the founder and publisher of George magazine, was piloting a single-engine Piper Saratoga when it plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. His wife and his sister-in-law were also in the aircraft and killed alongside Kennedy.  The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the crash probably happened after Kennedy, who was inexperienced at flying his plane alone at night, became disoriented in haze.   We rate this post Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2022/jun/28/instagram-posts/no-clintons-and-bushes-didnt-help-assassinate-jfk-/

Barnes partially right on claim that Johnson has received $1.2 million from gun lobby
","Following the mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas, the U.S. Senate has moved to address gun violence – a measure some argues does too little, while others say goes too far. In Wisconsin, Democrats running for the U.S. Senate have been targeting incumbent Ron Johnson, a Republican seeking a third term. That includes Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who in a May 27, 2022 news release said: ""Ron Johnson will do or say anything to distract from the $1.2 million he’s taken from the gun lobby.""  Has Johnson really accepted that much money from the pro-gun lobby?  When we reached out to Barnes’ campaign, press secretary Lauren Chou pointed to data collected by Brady United, a nonpartisan gun violence prevention group founded after the passage of the Brady Law in 1993. The data outlines which U.S. senators have benefitted the most from donations from the National Rifle Association.  According to the data, Johnson has received nearly $1.27 million from the NRA during his time as a senator, including both direct campaign contributions and indirect spending, such as TV commercials.  OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan nonprofit research group that tracks money in politics, had similar numbers. According to its database on spending by gun interest groups, Johnson has received $222,529 in direct support, in addition to more than $1 million in outside spending since he took office in 2017. (That counts spending in support of Johnson, or against his opponents).  That leads to an important distinction we want to underline. While Johnson has received about $1.2 million in overall support from pro-gun groups since his first election in 2010, only about $223,000 has been directly accepted by his campaign. As noted, the other $1 million has been spent on his behalf by those groups.  So, Barnes is off in how he characterizes it. ""We determined approximately 83 percent of the dollars they say Senator Johnson has ‘taken from the gun lobby’ are independent expenditures over which he had absolutely no control, and in fact, did not have any personal knowledge of,"" said Alexa Henning, a Johnson campaign spokesperson.  For context, a May 27, 2022 report, TMJ4-TV in Milwaukee took a look at how the gun lobby’s spending on Johnson compares to other politicians. Johnson had the 15th highest total of any current elected officials in the U.S., the report said. It also noted that the NRA has spent more than $771,000 against Wisconsin’s other U.S. Senator, Democrat Tammy Baldwin. That’s the 10th highest dollar amount spent against any sitting elected official.  Our ruling Barnes claimed Johnson has taken $1.2 million from the gun lobby.  Data shows that Johnson has received – through both direct and indirect contributions - about $1.2 million in support since his first campaign started in 2016.  But of that, only about $200,000 went directly to his campaign. The remainder – more than $1 million – represents outside spending either in support of Johnson, or against his opponents over time. So, Barnes is off in his wording. Our definition for Half True is ""the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" That fits here",/factchecks/2022/jun/28/mandela-barnes/barnes-partially-right-claim-johnson-has-received-/
"['Abortion', 'Population', 'States', 'Jonathan Turley']","
The complicated calculation to determine what share of the population will retain abortion rights
","Shortly after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the decision that protected the right to abortion nationally, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley cautioned in an interview with Fox News that the immediate impact would be modest. ""The majority of citizens in the country will have no change at all because … most of the population resides in states that have already protected abortion rights,"" Turley said June 24, the day of the decision. Whether he’s right depends on the definition of ""already protected."" By overturning Roe, the Supreme Court allowed states to decide for themselves whether to allow or prohibit abortion. In advance of the ruling, numerous states had either passed laws to preemptively protect abortion rights within their borders or passed ""trigger laws"" to outlaw the procedure if the court were to overrule Roe. In all, 16 states plus the District of Columbia passed laws directly allowing access to abortions: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. Collectively, these states account for 125.7 million residents, or 37.9% of the nation’s population of 331.4 million people as calculated by the 2020 Census. So by this standard of affirmatively acting to keep abortion legal — which would seem to be in line with Turley’s phrasing of ""states that have already protected abortion rights"" — he would be incorrect, since 37.9% is not equivalent to ""most of the population."" However, Turley told PolitiFact that he wasn’t using this as his definition. Rather, he was referring to the states that are left once the states that are banning abortion are removed from the equation. The core group of states in this category are those that passed ""trigger laws"" to ban abortion in the event that Roe was overturned. This includes 13 states: Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. The implementation timeline varies by state, but each of the 13 should have laws against abortion in place within weeks, if not sooner. Collectively, these 13 states account for 20.7% of the U.S. population. However, there are other states that can also ban abortions through existing laws. Some states have laws predating Roe, often by decades, that could ""snap back"" to ban abortions in the absence of Roe’s protections. The five states in this category are Alabama, Arizona, Michigan, West Virginia and Wisconsin. These states account for another 9% of the population. Legal challenges to these old laws are expected, so the banning of abortion in these states may not be as swift or as certain as it is in the trigger-law states. Still, even if abortion remains legal in these states pending court challenges, it would be inaccurate to describe these five states using Turley’s phrasing — ""states that have already protected abortion rights."" Then, there are states that have passed abortion bans that had been blocked by the courts during the period when Roe was in place. These laws would likely be allowed to go into effect now that Roe is gone, though that process may take some time.  Four states fall into this category: Georgia, Iowa, Ohio and South Carolina. Together, they account for another 9.3% of the population. All told, states that are potentially on a path to outlawing abortion include up to 39% of the U.S. population.  The flip side of this figure — and this is where Turley has a point — is that 61% of the population lives in states where abortion is poised to remain legal, at least in the short term. That’s because something not affirmatively banned is presumed legal.  In many of these states, abortion is not actually ""protected"" by a law, to use Turley’s term. While abortion remains legal for now in these states, a law banning it could be passed at any time without having to repeal a law protecting abortion. Twelve states have neither explicitly protected abortion through a law nor do they have laws on the books that would ban abortion after the overturning of Roe. And they are a mixed bag politically.  Some are generally blue or purple in their political orientation and are expected to keep abortion legal. These include Minnesota, New Hampshire and New Mexico. Others are strongly Republican and could pass laws in fairly short order to ban abortion if they wished, including Indiana, Montana and Nebraska. Other states where the future of abortion rights is unclear are solidly in the purple category and could see heated legislative sparring over abortion, including Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Ultimately, whether a majority of Americans end up living in states with or without legal abortion will depend on how these 12 states divide on this issue. Turley said, ""The majority of citizens in the country will have no change at all because … most of the population resides in states that have already protected abortion rights."" We found that 38% of the population lives in states that have ""already protected abortion rights"" in the sense that they affirmatively passed laws to keep abortion legal in the absence of Roe. At the same time, another 39% of the population lives in states that have passed laws banning abortion and that are poised to go into effect with the overturning of Roe.  This leaves 61% of the population — a majority — living in a state where, for now at least, the overturning of Roe isn’t changing the legal status of abortion. In many of these states, abortion is not actually ""protected"" by a law but rather by the principle that something not affirmatively banned is presumed to be legal.

Roe reversal, ending national access to abortion, makes US an outlier among developed nations
","President Joe Biden claimed that the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade made America an aberration when it comes to abortion access.   ""With this decision, the conservative majority of the Supreme Court shows how extreme it is, how far removed they are from the majority of this country,"" Biden said a couple hours after the ruling was released on June 24. ""They have made the United States an outlier among developed nations in the world."" While the high court’s decision leaves in place state laws that permit abortion, it removes the national right to an abortion — something that is widely guaranteed by laws or court rulings in other developed nations. RELATED VIDEO: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com With few exceptions, legal abortion is available in ""peer nations,"" including in countries comparable to the U.S. in terms of development or in their use of a common law system, said Martha Davis, a law professor at Northeastern University who filed an amicus brief in 2021 with the court arguing that Roe should not be overturned. The high court ruled 6-3 to uphold a restrictive Mississippi law and 5-4 to reverse Roe, with the majority opinion saying ""the Constitution makes no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion."" The decision ended nearly 50 years of federally protected access to abortion and returned power to individual states to set their own laws. That means access to abortion varies widely in the U.S.: Sixteen states, including California and New York, plus the District of Columbia, have passed laws allowing access to abortions. Eighteen states, including Michigan and Wisconsin, are about to see abortion become illegal soon, if not immediately. These states either have pre-Roe laws restricting abortion that snap back into effect if Roe is overturned, or they have ""trigger"" laws that were written to take effect in the absence of Roe. In the remaining 16 states, the legality of abortion is currently unclear, for various reasons. This includes such states as Minnesota and Pennsylvania. This lack of uniformity sets the U.S. apart from other countries. Most developed countries have a national standard for access to abortion or consistency across subnational entities rather than wide variations in laws amongst states, Davis said. In the U.S., ""we’re going to have some places that are at no abortion at all,"" which is ""clearly an outlier"" among other nations, she said. Developed nations consisting of the world’s leading economies are sometimes referred to as the G7, or the Group of Seven, which includes the U.S. and six other industrialized nations. Unlike the U.S., those six have national laws or court decisions that allow access to abortion, with various restrictions. Canada: Allows abortion on request and there is no federal gestational restriction, but subnational governments have a variety of restrictions. United Kingdom: Allows abortion until 24 weeks of pregnancy with the authorization of two doctors — or later than that if continuation of the pregnancy past 24 weeks involves risk of grave physical and mental injury or if there are severe fetal abnormalities. In Northern Ireland, elective abortions are allowed until 12 weeks, up to 24 weeks in cases of physical and mental health of the pregnant woman (and with doctors' authorization), and afterward in such circumstances as fetal impairment. France: Restricts elective abortions after 12 to 14 weeks, but has exceptions for specific economic or mental health reasons that extend the cutoffs. Germany: Restricts elective abortions after 12 to 14 weeks. Italy: Restricts elective abortions after 12 to 14 weeks. Japan: Allows abortions up to 22 weeks for socioeconomic reasons and in cases of rape, though spousal permission is required. Other developed nations also have national laws that allow abortion access. Nations that allow elective abortion until 20 weeks of pregnancy include China, the Netherlands and New Zealand. In 2020, Argentine lawmakers voted to legalize abortions up to 14 weeks. In February, Colombia legalized abortion during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. In Australia, laws vary by state or territory, but the three largest states permit abortions up to 22 to 24 weeks. Laws ""vary widely from place to place,"" said Davis of Northeastern University, and in some countries, you might need to obtain an additional doctor's note after certain stages of pregnancy. But in many such situations ""those sorts of regulations are not significant hurdles to people.""  ""They're not used as kind of weapons in the way that sometimes they are in the United States, as a way of preventing people from from getting an abortion,"" she said.  The three dissenting justices argued that the global trend ""has been toward increased provision of legal and safe abortion care.""  A number of countries, including New Zealand, the Netherlands and Iceland, permit abortions up to a roughly similar time as Roe did (up to 24 weeks), and most Western European countries ""often have liberal exceptions"" to time-limit restrictions, including to prevent harm to a woman’s physical or mental health, they wrote. Comparing abortion laws globally, a 2022 Council on Foreign Relations report said the past 50 years have seen ""an unmistakable trend toward the liberalization of abortion laws, particularly in the industrialized world.""  By its review, 38 countries have changed their abortion laws since 2008, and all but one of those changes ""expanded the legal grounds on which women can access abortion services."" The Center for Reproductive Rights said that over the past several decades, nearly 50 countries had liberalized their abortion laws. Biden said the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade ""made the United States an outlier among developed nations in the world"" on abortion rights. The ruling eliminates the national right to an abortion, which puts the U.S. at odds with other developed nations, including the other six G-7 nations, most of which have laws or court rulings that provide for abortion access on a national basis, though with restrictions. The U.S. ruling does leave in place state laws that permit abortion. We rate Biden’s statement Mostly True.

GOP challenger overstates parole board’s record under Hochul
","Rob Astorino, a Republican running to unseat Gov. Kathy Hochul in November, said 20 people who had been convicted of killing police officers have been released on parole in the last two years.   ""We’ve got a parole board right now that has released 20 cop killers in the last two years under Hochul. They should all be fired,"" Astorino said during a June 13 GOP primary debate.  Republican candidates for governor -- former Trump White House official Andrew Giuliani, businessman Harry Wilson, Rep. Lee Zeldin of Long Island and Astorino -- have talked extensively about crime during their campaigns. We wondered if Astorino, a former county executive in Westchester County, was correct.   We reached out to the Astorino campaign, and it sent a list of 19 people convicted of killing police officers who had been released on parole dating back to December 2017. The campaign also sent a news report that quoted a union leader who said there had recently been 23 such parole board releases.  Hochul became governor on Aug. 24, 2021, following the resignation of Andrew Cuomo. Hochul had been lieutenant governor since 2015, having run on a ticket with Cuomo, although lieutenant governors are elected independently of their running mates.  Astorino’s campaign spokesperson, Bill O’Reilly, said that Astorino was counting all of the releases while Hochul served as lieutenant governor and governor. Of the campaign’s list of 19 parolees, three were released during Hochul’s governorship. Six were released in the last two years.   We also contacted the New York City Police Benevolent Association, which tracks these releases, and John P. Nuthall, a spokesperson, sent us a list of 34 people convicted in connection with the deaths of law enforcement officers, though the union said the list may not cover every such case statewide. Like Astorino’s list, the union list went back to late 2017. On the union’s list, five people had been released since Hochul became governor, and 15 were released in the last two years.  PolitiFact confirmed the names on the list by using the state's inmate and parolee look-up databases, as well as news reports about the crimes. In one case, a parolee released in April 2020 on the union list was not convicted with the murder of a police officer, but was convicted in a robbery connected to the crime. In at least two cases, the parolee was deported after release. Parole board members are appointed by the governor, and must be confirmed by the state Senate. They serve six-year terms, and can be re-appointed. There are 19 spots on the board, though not all are filled. Many were appointed by prior governors, though Hochul had a recent appointment.  We spoke with Martin F. Horn, a former executive director and chief operating officer of the New York State Division of Parole, who said that the governor's influence is indirect, and the board works independently. However, members generally want to get re-appointed, and tend to follow the governor’s political preferences. If they sense the governor is tough on crime, then they tend to be tough on crime too. But Horn said that governors generally don’t have influence on a case-by-case basis, and cannot remove members based on individual decisions. He could not recall a time when a governor asked for a certain ruling from the board for an inmate.  The board sits in panels of three, and the panels are randomized, so it would be difficult to engineer a predetermined outcome for a specific inmate, Horn said. Lieutenant governors do not have influence over the board, he said.  The state Parole Board falls within the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Spokespeople for the department declined to speak on the record about the number of people recently released on parole who had been convicted in connection with the death of a law enforcement officer. A Freedom of Information Act request for this information was not immediately fulfilled.  At the GOP debate, Astorino said 20 people convicted of killing law enforcement officers were released in the last two years, under Hochul.  Hochul became governor less than a year ago. Before that she was lieutenant governor. The governor appoints members of the parole board, and they must be confirmed by the Senate. The members are not appointed by the lieutenant governor.  Asked for evidence of his claim, Astorino's campaign provided a list of 19 people who had been convicted of killing a law enforcement officer and had been released on parole since late 2017. Only six had been paroled in the last two years, and only three had been paroled since Hochul became governor. A more comprehensive list from a police union showed 15 had been paroled in the last two years, and five since Hochul became governor.  Astorino’s campaign said the candidate included all of the parolees convicted in a police officer’s death since Hochul was lieutenant governor or governor. While Astorino’s tally of those parolees was 19, a police union list showed 34 such releases dating back four and a half years.  But that is not what he said at the debate. Astorino said parole releases in the past two years, giving listeners the wrong impression about the time frame of these releases.  We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2022/jun/24/rob-astorino/gop-challenger-overstates-parole-boards-record-und/

Scant evidence that 15% of abortions are the result of coercion
","What leads women to seek abortions? A statistic shared by a pro-abortion group suggested one alarming reason: coercion. As the United States Supreme Court on June 24 handed down its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that gave women the constitutional right to an abortion, PolitiFact sought to learn more about the source of claims like this one. In this case, the coercion statistic came from the United Kingdom — and it didn’t show what a tweet from the pro-abortion group suggested.  Its source was a poll commissioned by the BBC in February that sought to evaluate how common it is for women to experience what is called ""reproductive coercion."" That’s a term used to describe a number of scenarios, including forcing people to have abortions they don't want, or damaging or hiding contraceptives to force a pregnancy. The survey, which involved 1,060 women in the United Kingdom aged 18 to 44, found that 50% of participants said they had experienced at least one type of reproductive coercion, according to the BBC.  An anti-abortion group in the U.S. elevated one aspect of the survey’s findings. ""We know that many babies are alive today because their mothers did receive that unexpected help,"" the National Right to Life Committee tweeted May 25. ""With recent research suggesting 15% of abortions are the result of coercion, that support is even more critical.""  The tweet links to a Right to Life UK story and is a shortened version of a quote by a spokesperson for Compassion Scotland, a group that campaigns against the implementation of buffer zones around clinics and hospitals that offer abortion. Spokesperson Hannah McNicol was quoted saying that women facing unplanned pregnancies deserve ""emotional and practical support"" and added that research suggests ""15% of abortions are the result of coercion."" In the poll, 158 women — about 15% of the survey’s participants — said they had experienced pressure to terminate a pregnancy when they didn't want to.  But these women did not indicate whether they got abortions, and the survey doesn’t reveal the source of the coercion. ""I definitely think that statistic has to consider a bit more context,"" said Kamila Alexander, a nurse clinician and researcher of reproductive coercion at Johns Hopkins University. ""The challenge with the way we measure (reproductive coercion) is that we ask women (in this case) to report the intentions of another party. Essentially, we are asking them to get into the mind of the person using the behaviors towards them."" We couldn’t find any study on the percentage of coerced abortions in the United States.  The National Right to Life Committee told us the comments from their tweet are from Right to Life UK, and that the two organizations are unrelated. ""The qualifying word in this quote and the tweet is ‘suggesting’ because that is what the study does. It suggests this is the case, but Right to Life UK can't say it definitely because it was only a survey and was limited,"" the committee told us in an email.  Women who are actively seeking an abortion in the U.S. are not asked if they are coerced into doing so, the group said.  Reproductive coercion is when someone uses pregnancy, contraception and sex as control. This type of coercion can take many forms and can come from different people, but the acts are often carried out by a person’s intimate partner, researchers have found.  Examples of this type of coercion include threatening to have a baby with someone else if the person doesn’t conceive, using violence to coerce a pregnancy, purposely breaking a condom, forcing a partner to terminate a pregnancy when they don’t want to, or injuring them in a way that may cause a miscarriage. It can also involve destroying contraceptives or creating barriers to birth control. The survey’s question about abortion coercion asked the women to answer whether they had experienced ""pressure to terminate a pregnancy when you did not want to."" Respondents were able to select among four answers: ""have experienced,"" ""have not experienced,"" ""don’t know"" or ""prefer not to say.""  Alexander, the nurse clinician and researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said she looked at the data in the U.K. study and saw that the root of the question — about pressure to terminate a pregnancy — doesn’t specify the source of the coercion.  Some studies show that family members, particularly mothers and mothers-in-law, can be influential ""around abortion decision-making,"" Alexander said. According to the BBC, a third of women who completed the survey said they had experienced pressure to have sex without contraception, making it the most common form of reproductive coercion in the survey. One-fifth said they had been forced to have sex without contraception. The survey also found that 1 in 10 of the women said they had experienced someone hiding, withholding or damaging their contraception, like poking holes in a condom on purpose. One in 10 also said they had experienced someone removing a condom during sex without consent, or ""stealthing."" Tweets claimed that research suggests that 15% of abortions are the result of coercion. The figure is based on a survey of about 1,000 women in the U.K. About 15% of the survey’s participants said they had experienced pressure to terminate a pregnancy when they didn't want to.  Contrary to the tweet, the women did not confirm whether they got an abortion. The survey also found that some women had been forced to have sex without contraception, had contraception damaged or withheld from them, and felt pressured to continue a pregnancy. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

""It is offensive and severely out of touch to call ‘gun violence’ a Democratic talking point — especially when, on average, 1,065 people die by guns per year in Virginia,"" Stoney tweeted June 16.  ""Moreover, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], firearms are the leading cause of death for children nationally, and in Virginia Black people are eight times more likely than white people to die of gun homicide. EIGHT TIMES,"" Stoney wrote. We fact-checked Stoney’s figure about the increased probability Black Virginians face of being murdered by a gun when compared with white people. His spokesperson pointed to research from the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety that indeed found Black people in Virginia were eight times more likely than white people to be victims of firearm homicides between 2016 to 2020.   Everytown attributed the statistic and others in its report to the CDC. So, we went to the CDC’s national database of underlying causes of death to examine the numbers. Here’s what we found about Virginia from 2016 to 2020: White people comprised 63% of Virginia’s population; Black people made up 20%. There were 1,814 gun homicides, killing 1,269 Black people and 518 white people. In other words, 70% of victims were Black and 29% white. Out of every 100,000 Black people living in Virginia, 14.3 were killed in a firearm homicide. Per 100,000 white Virginians, 1.7 were killed in that manner. The firearm murder rate for Black people was 8.4 times higher than the rate for white people. Everytown accurately rounded down to eight times, the number Stoney used. Nationally, Black people were 11.2 times more likely than white people to be murdered by firearms. The rates were 21.3 per 100,000 for Black people and 1.9 per 100,000 for white people. The racial disparity is even wider among males, who were victims in 85% of U.S. firearm homicides from 2016 to 2020. Nationally, 39.7 per 100,000 Black males were killed in gun homicides compared with 2.8 white males per 100,000. Black males were 14.2 times more likely to be murdered by firearms. In Virginia, 26.1 per 100,000 Black males were gun homicide victims compared with 2.4 per 100,000 white males. Black males were 10.9 times more likely to be murdered by firearms. In Richmond, 65.6 Black males per 100,000 were firearm homicide victims. The CDC does not have a corresponding figure for white males. We should finally note that Greene, the health commissioner, has been roundly criticized for his comments, including by the person who appointed him: Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Greene has tempered his statements dismissing the role of structural racism in public health since they were first reported by The Washington Post on June 15. Our ruling Stoney said, ""In Virginia, Black people are eight times (8X) more likely than white people to die of gun homicide."" CDC figures show that 14.3 out of every 100,000 Black Virginians were killed in gun homicides from 2016 to 2020. The rate for white people was 1.7 per 100,000. In other words, Black people in Virginia were 8.4 times more likely than white people to be murdered by firearms.

Kevin McCarthy said domestic oil is more affordable than imported oil. It costs more
","For House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., President Joe Biden’s planned meeting with Saudi Arabian leaders — including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, who U.S. intelligence concluded ordered the murder of a Saudi dissident — was proof of a flawed policy. ""A 12-hour, non-stop international flight,"" McCarthy tweeted June 17. ""That’s how far President Biden would rather travel to plead for Saudi Arabian oil rather than simply issue more drilling permits to producers here at home. American oil is cleaner. More reliable. And more affordable. Put America FIRST!"" We focused on the pocketbook issue in that tweet. Americans are struggling with gas prices that top $5 a gallon, and McCarthy’s pitch that oil from home is more affordable might seem like common sense. Shipping oil across an ocean sounds more expensive than pumping it here at home. But the power of global market pricing and the cost of getting oil out of the ground and to refineries undercut McCarthy’s claim. McCarthy’s spokesperson Mark Bednar said the proof lies in the law of supply and demand. ""If we had more American energy production, we could lower the global price by increasing supply,"" Bednar said. McCarthy’s tweet didn’t say domestic production would lead to lower prices. It said domestic oil was, in itself, more affordable compared with Saudi Arabian oil. But even accounting for Bednar’s explanation, McCarthy’s statement runs into a problem of scale. The global market is huge, and American production is relatively small, said analysts with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, a branch of the Federal Reserve System. ""Even under the most optimistic view, U.S. production increases would likely add only a few hundred thousand barrels per day above current forecasts,"" the analysts wrote in May. ""This amounts to a proverbial drop in the bucket in the 100-million-barrel-per-day global oil market."" Global markets matter because the single biggest factor behind the price of gasoline is the price of crude oil. Refineries change crude oil into petroleum products to fuel vehicles.  In April, crude oil accounted for 60% of the price of gasoline, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Since the initial economic wallop from the coronavirus in the spring of 2020, demand for oil has risen steadily as business activity has increased. Supply hasn’t been able to keep up due to delays in restoring drilling capacity, higher transportation costs, and sluggish production increases.  And the price of oil on the global market is what American gasoline producers have to deal with. ""The first thing to know about oil is that it is set on a GLOBAL market,"" MIT energy economist Christopher Knittel tweeted in March. ""There is, effectively, one price. So, any supply disruption, anywhere, affects that price and therefore prices in the U.S."" It’s not as though increased domestic production would have no impact, but Knittel said it would be diluted. If American production rose by a whopping 10%, it would add over 1 million barrels a day to global supplies. ""Sadly, that's only 1% of world production,"" Knittel wrote. ""Would it lower prices? Sure. But not by as much as people often think."" And a production hike would take time. Today, the U.S. produces 11.7 million barrels a day. Government forecasters estimate it will take about another year before the country adds another million barrels to that. For those who argue that trend is because of Biden administration policies, it’s oil producers who have held back investments, as they balance financial goals against the future price of oil. Looking at what McCarthy actually said — that domestic oil is itself more affordable — the numbers don’t back that up. Saudi oil is easily produced, and transporting it is not a major factor. ""The costs of importing oil from Saudi Arabia are very low,"" said Eric Lewis, an energy economist at Texas A&M University. ""Shipping overseas from a place that has oil export facilities is easy."" In talking about affordability, McCarthy introduced an ambiguous concept. Affordability could be limited to the cost of just getting the oil out of the ground. It could mean that cost, plus the expense of moving the oil to a refinery. The Energy Information Administration tracks how much refiners pay for domestic and imported oil. In the past 10 years, domestic oil has cost more. You have to go back to November 2012 to find a month when the cost of a barrel of domestic oil was less than a barrel of imported oil. In April, the most recent month for which we have numbers, a barrel of domestic oil cost $7.13 more than a barrel of imported oil. Since February 2021 — the month when the price returned to its pre-pandemic level — domestic oil has cost an average of $4.06 more per barrel. It doesn’t help McCarthy’s case if we look solely at the cost of getting oil out of the ground. In terms of data, this is a tricky area. Particularly for the world’s second largest producer, Saudi Arabia, energy analyst Lutz Kilian at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said there is no official source. ""Saudi Arabia’s numbers are a closely guarded state secret, but are thought to be very low,"" Kilian said, referring to Saudi production costs. The private energy research firm Rystad Energy has a unique way of measuring what it takes to produce oil in different regions. Rystad’s yardstick looks at future costs, and so might not match other methods of estimating production costs. But if nothing else, it helps show how different production regions stand relative to each other. In Rystad’s 2020 analysis, at $31 a barrel, onshore Middle Eastern oil fields have the world’s lowest production cost. For deepwater wells, which would include some U.S. production, the number is $43 a barrel, and for North American oil produced through fracking (hydraulic fracturing), the cost is $44 a barrel. Other North American sources cost even more. Again, U.S. oil costs more than oil from Saudi Arabia and its neighbors. McCarthy said that domestic oil is ""more affordable"" than foreign oil. His spokesperson said that was true because more oil from the U.S. would increase global supplies and lead to lower prices. That isn’t what McCarthy’s tweet said, but even if that’s what he had in mind, experts said any impact on the price of gasoline would take about a year to materialize and would be modest even then. Taking McCarthy’s words at face value, domestic oil is not more affordable. Whether looking at the price paid by refineries, or the simple cost of production, domestic oil costs more than imported oil.

Claims connecting sudden death in athletes to COVID-19 vaccines fall short of scrutiny
","Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome, also known as SADS, has been studied for years. The syndrome is caused by an undetected genetic heart condition and often occurs in young adulthood.  But ever since COVID-19 vaccines were released in late 2020, people have continually suggested that the shots are making SADS more common.  Articles and social media posts have highlighted instances of young athletes collapsing during games, with claims that the rate of these occurrences are way up since the vaccines came to market.   Take this Instagram post: ""SADS — according to International Olympic Committee data, an average of 29 athletes under the age of 35 suffer sudden death per year from 1966-2004. From March 2021 to March 2022, 769 athletes have died or suffered cardiac arrest."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There are a number of issues here. First: the data itself. While the study that the post described as ""International Olympic Committee data"" only reflects sudden deaths, the 769 figure it is being compared with incorporates deaths and cardiac arrest episodes that did not result in death. PolitiFact’s review of some of the reports that were counted in that figure also found the number included reports of cases that didn’t involve any emergency medical episodes at all.  Second, the study that the Instagram post said looked at sudden cardiac deaths in athletes from 1966 to 2004 wasn’t, as it suggested, conducted by the International Olympic Committee. Rather, the findings were presented at a Dec. 7, 2004, committee meeting by researchers affiliated with the University Hospital Center in Lausanne, Switzerland. We were unable to get in touch with researchers involved in that study for more details or updated figures, and the International Olympic Committee told us that it doesn’t track this kind of data. The 769 figure, meanwhile, comes from an April 2022 segment on One America News Network, a conservative cable news service that in the past has shared problematic claims related to COVID-19.  In the clip, reporter Pearson Sharp talked about how tennis players Jannik Sinner and Paula Badosa had to drop out of the Miami Open in 2021. Sharp then said the women were just two of ""more than 769 athletes who have collapsed during a game on the field over the last year from March of 2021 to March of this year."" However, Sinner and Badosa did not collapse during any match. Tennis officials confirmed that Sinner was suffering from foot blisters and Badosa had a viral illness at the time. We reached out to Sharp about the data he used to get the figure. He told us the deaths and injuries were taken directly from headlines collected over the past year from around the world and sent several examples. But PolitiFact — and others — have repeatedly investigated the incidents cited in these claims. The details of these episodes show that vaccines are neither causing athletes to collapse, nor are they connected to other sudden death episodes.  A review of the articles Sharp sent over also showed that the reports aren’t consistent. Some cite medical professionals who ruled out vaccination as a cause. Others don’t include any information on the athlete’s vaccination status. And some were about athletes that neither collapsed nor experienced a cardiac event.  One of the examples is Gilbert Kwemoi, a Gold medalist middle-distance runner from Kenya who collapsed in his home and died in August 2021. None of the reports about his death that we reviewed indicate whether he was vaccinated against COVID-19 or if it was a cardiac event that caused his death. His brother told news outlets that Kwemoi had developed an ""illness"" at a training camp. Another is French soccer player Franck Berrier, who died of a heart attack in August 2021 while playing tennis. But Berrier, before the vaccines were on the market, had acknowledged that he had a heart condition. Berrier was quoted in 2019 to have said that his heart was only working ""at 70%"" ""There is no danger in day-to-day life,"" Berrier said, ""but if I put too much strain on it there's the risk that blood won't be pumped in fast enough and I'll have a heart attack.""  Sharp cited stories about the deaths of Ahmed Amin, an Egyptian soccer player, and Avi Barot, an Indian cricketer. But they make no mention of whether the men received a vaccine, or what their causes of death were. Sharp also pointed to the case of Kjeld Nuis, a Dutch speed skater. Nuis briefly developed pericarditis after receiving Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine but he didn’t collapse during any sporting event and he didn’t say whether his vaccination contributed to his heart problem or whether it was linked to his athletic activity. After experiencing some flu-like symptoms and chest pressure, Nuis said he was examined by his sports doctor and cardiologist.  ""Was immediately able to go the next day and after a heart film, ultrasound and an MRI. Everything seems to be fine! Now at training camp,"" the skater said on his Instagram page. Another popular example in claims like the one on Instagram is the collapse of Danish soccer player Christian Eriksen. But Eriksen, according to his team director, wasn’t vaccinated for COVID-19 when he suffered cardiac arrest during a match in June 2021. ""To date, I am not aware of a single COVID vaccine-related cardiac complication in professional sports,"" Matthew Martinez, a sports cardiologist who works with the National Football League, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League and Major League Soccer and who is the director of sports cardiology at Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey told us in December. Martinez reaffirmed that observation when we reached out to him again in June. The same goes for Jonathan Kim, an associate professor of medicine and chief of sports cardiology at Emory University in Atlanta. ""I am not aware of any reports that vaccines in athletes are causing cardiac issues,"" he said.  Studies and scientific reviews found no association between vaccination and deaths in anyone — adults or children — except in rare cases, according to a 2015 study. More recently, following the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, a 2021 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found no increased risk for death among those vaccinated for COVID-19. According to the Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes Foundation, SADS conditions are genetic heart problems that can cause sudden death in young, apparently healthy, people.  Warning signs of SADS conditions include family history of sudden, unexplained death under age 40, fainting or seizure during exercise, excitement or startle, and consistent or unusual chest pain and/or shortness of breath during exercise, the SADS foundation said. These conditions have been studied for decades, and the foundation told PolitiFact that there is ""no evidence"" suggesting that any of the COVID-19 vaccines cause people to develop SADS conditions, or make people’s conditions more severe. Dr. Michael J. Ackerman, director of the Long QT Syndrome Clinic and professor of medicine, pediatrics and molecular pharmacology at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine said there is not a ""single signal"" of increased SADS events among diagnosed and treated patients who’ve been vaccinated. ""Over two years into the pandemic, there’s been no indication in the largest programs in the world of an increase in death from these conditions,"" Ackerman said. An Instagram post claims that an average of 29 young athletes suffered sudden death per year from 1966 to 2004, while 769 athletes have died or suffered cardiac arrest from March 2021 to March 2022, suggesting the COVID-19 vaccines have caused a spike in sudden deaths.  A study published in 2006 found that an average of 29 young athletes experienced sudden deaths over a nearly 40-year span, but there is no comparable study to weigh it against. The 769 figure is based on a collection of articles that incorporate reports of athlete deaths, cardiac arrest incidents and various incomplete anecdotes that didn’t involve any emergency medical episodes or have any confirmed connection to the vaccines.  Studies and scientific reviews have found no association between vaccination and sudden deaths, and officials with the SADS foundation, as well as sports cardiologists, say there is no evidence that suggests any of the COVID-19 vaccines cause people to experience sudden death.

GOP Nevada Senate hopeful Adam Laxalt backed birth control restrictions as attorney general
","Amid the anticipated reversal of Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., attacked her election opponent over access to birth control. In a race that could decide party control of the Senate, which is now split 50-50, Cortez Masto targeted Republican Adam Laxalt in a 15-second video ad on Facebook and Instagram. ""Women’s health care is under assault, and Adam Laxalt is leading the charge,"" the narrator says as a Politico headline appears about the the Supreme Court’s leaked draft decision, which indicated the court is poised to overturn the national right to abortion. ""He supports eliminating Nevada's protections for legal abortions. He even wants to restrict access to birth control,"" the narrator says. Text on the screen went further: ""Laxalt worked to limit access to birth control,"" it said. Laxalt is endorsed by former President Donald Trump. The ad’s claim about Laxalt getting rid of Nevada's protections for legal abortions is Half True. We did not find evidence that Laxalt supports entirely eliminating protections for legal abortions. But when asked about presenting Nevada voters with a referendum that would restrict abortion access, he indicated he would support it. On the birth control claim, Laxalt has not campaigned on limiting access. But as Nevada’s attorney general, he participated in efforts to reduce access to contraceptives. Democrats hope that the leak of the draft opinion could energize their voters in the Nov. 8 race, which campaign watchers rate as a toss-up. Cortez Masto, a first-term senator, is the first Latina to serve in the Senate. As evidence for the ad’s claim, Cortez Masto’s campaign cited two legal briefs Laxalt joined and a letter he signed as attorney general. In 2015, Laxalt announced that he joined on behalf of Nevada, along with other state attorneys general, in filing a U.S. Supreme Court brief against a national mandate for employers to provide free contraception to employees.  The amicus, or friend-of-the-court, brief was filed in support of a lawsuit filed by the Little Sisters of the Poor against the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. Amicus briefs are filed by people or groups who are not parties to the case but have a strong interest in the case and want to persuade the court’s ruling. The Little Sisters, a Catholic order, sued to be exempted from the Affordable Care Act’s rule that employer health plans offer free contraceptive coverage. The litigation revolved around whether sincerely held religious or moral objections to contraceptives would allow the employer to sidestep that requirement.  ""This brief encourages the Supreme Court to take the necessary steps toward ensuring that our government and our courts do not force people of faith to violate their religious beliefs,"" Laxalt was quoted as saying in a press release announcing the filing. The case was eventually consolidated with several related cases and argued before the Supreme Court. Laxalt also joined in filing a brief in support of religious organizations in the consolidated case.  In 2016, Laxalt acted on behalf of Nevada, joining a Supreme Court amicus brief in support of Washington state pharmacists who refused to, against regulations, dispense emergency contraception pills on religious grounds.  In 2018, Laxalt and other attorneys general signed a letter to the secretary of Health and Human Services expressing support for regulations to protect health care workers who object to performing certain medical procedures. The letter said contraception, sterilization procedures, abortions and other procedures ""all raise serious dilemmas for healthcare providers who hold a wide range of religious and moral convictions.""  Laxalt’s campaign did not respond to PolitiFact’s call and emails. His campaign website describes Laxalt as ""pro-life"" but does not address the topic of birth control.  We searched Google, Newspapers.com, the Nexis news database and Laxalt’s Twitter account but did not find any statements by Laxalt since 2018 on birth control access. Cortez Masto said Laxalt ""wants to restrict"" and ""worked to limit access to birth control."" As Nevada’s attorney general, Laxalt supported efforts that would have reduced access to birth control. We did not find that he has made any statements since 2018 on restricting access. We rate the statement Mostly True. PolitiFact staff researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.

Nevada GOP Senate hopeful Adam Laxalt open to tightening abortion restrictions, but not banning it
","Democratic Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is drawing on fears about abortion restrictions to repel a challenge from Republican Adam Laxalt in a tossup race that could decide party control of the Senate, which is now split 50-50. ""Women’s health care is under assault, and Adam Laxalt is leading the charge,"" the narrator said in a 15-second video ad Cortez Masto shared on Facebook and Instagram. On screen, a Politico headline appears about the U.S. Supreme Court draft decision that, if finalized, would overturn abortion rights. ""Laxalt supports eliminating Nevada's protections for legal abortions,"" the narrator continues. ""He even wants to restrict access to birth control."" Text on the screen went further: ""Laxalt worked to limit access to birth control,"" it said. We rated the claim about Laxalt and restrictions to birth control as Mostly True. As Nevada's attorney general, Laxalt supported efforts that would have restricted access to birth control. But he hasn’t spoken publicly about this issue during his Senate campaign. On the abortion claim, we didn’t find that Laxalt has said he would entirely eliminate abortion protections. But he supports holding a referendum asking Nevada voters to restrict abortion after 13 weeks of pregnancy. That would be a tighter restriction than under current Nevada law. Laxalt’s campaign did not respond to our call and emails.  His campaign website describes Laxalt as ""pro-life"" and says he opposes taxpayer funding for abortions."" It also says he opposes codifying ""barbaric partial-birth abortion practices as federal law."" Abortion rights became a pivotal election issue after the May 2 leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court case. If the draft is finalized, it would effectively eliminate the national right to an abortion and leave it up to each state to decide their own policies.  Nevada is one of 16 states, plus the District of Columbia, that has passed laws protecting access to abortions. Nevada law allows abortion through 24 weeks of pregnancy and after 24 weeks, if it is to preserve the woman’s life or health.  Nevada’s law was passed by the state legislature and later adopted by voters in a 1990 referendum, which passed with 63% of the vote. In Nevada, when a statute is affirmed by voters in a referendum, it can only be changed by another referendum. So the state’s abortion protections would stay in place even if Roe were overturned.  Nevada’s law would be superseded, however, if there were a national law banning abortion.  After Politico published the Supreme Court draft, Laxalt said in a statement that if the draft reflects the court’s ultimate ruling, it would be an ""historic victory for the sanctity of life."" But, alluding to the 1990 referendum, he said that even if Roe were overturned, Nevadans had ""already voted to make abortion rights legal in our state,"" and that the matter is ""settled law."" Laxalt has not campaigned on restricting abortion access but, he has indicated support for going to Nevada voters with a new referendum that would restrict abortion after 13 weeks.  Cortez Masto’s campaign cited as evidence for its claim a May 14 opinion article by a Las Vegas Review-Journal columnist giving advice to Nevada Republicans. ""Propose sending voters a 13-week abortion ban with exceptions for physical health, rape and incest. The Legislature could pass and the governor could sign a 13-week ban that goes into effect only if voters support it,"" Victor Joecks wrote.  When asked, Laxalt said he ""would support this,"" the column said.  ""This position is much more in line with the vast majority of Nevadans,"" the column quotes Laxalt as saying. In 2018, while running for governor, Laxalt was asked by a Reno TV reporter if he would pursue a referendum to change the 1990 referendum. ""We’re going to look into it,"" he replied. This is not the only time Cortez Masto, a first-term senator and the first Latina to serve in the Senate, has attacked Laxalt on abortion rights. Another ad claimed, without citing evidence, that Laxalt would vote for a nationwide abortion ban.  A Las Vegas TV station asked Laxalt on May 13 whether he would support an effort to ban abortion nationally if Roe were overturned. ""Roe was wrongly decided … I think this needs to go to the states and, as I said, Nevada is obviously decided in their referendum,"" he said. As attorney general, Laxalt filed court briefs supporting efforts to restrict abortion access in other states, and one in support of crisis pregnancy centers, which counsel women against getting abortions. Those cases would not have affected abortion access in Nevada. Cortez Masto said Laxalt ""supports eliminating Nevada's protections for legal abortions."" Laxalt has said that the matter of abortion rights in Nevada is settled law. Nevada law allows abortion through 24 weeks of pregnancy and after 24 weeks, if it is to preserve the woman’s life or health.  However, Laxalt has also said that if the Supreme Court overturned Roe, it would be a ""​​historic victory for the sanctity of life."" Additionally, he has expressed support for a referendum that would ask Nevada voters about restricting access to abortions in the state.

Fact-checking Larry Summers’ formula for unemployment, inflation, and recessions
","Amid the public outcry over inflation hitting 40-year highs, Harvard economist Larry Summers — one of the earliest and most vocal figures to warn that inflation was more worrisome than many policymakers believed — has become something of an oracle on the topic, appearing frequently in print, on television, and even sharing a phone call with President Joe Biden. Summers, a veteran of the Clinton and Obama administrations but considered something of a centrist, has taken to articulating a clear message. Summers says the current high inflation rate needs to be taken seriously, but he adds that trying to combat it necessarily risks another problem: tipping the economy into a recession.  On June 17, Summers told Barron’s that ""when you have unemployment below 4% and inflation above 4%, recession always follows within two years."" (Summers used the same formula in an interview with NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" two days later.) Currently, the unemployment rate is 3.6% and the inflation rate is 8.6%, so if Summers’ rule is correct, then the U.S. should be facing a recession sometime in the next 24 months. Economists told us that the theory behind Summer’s broader point is solid: To tackle inflation, the Federal Reserve needs to hike interest rates, and doing so will inevitably hamper business expansion, which increases the likelihood of layoffs and slower economic growth. Even if Summers’ logic is sound based on economic theory, we found that Summers’ formula, at least as stated in media appearances, is at best oversimplified and under-nuanced. Summers’ premise — that there are a decent number of time periods when unemployment was below 4% at the same time inflation was above 4% — has problems from the start. In reality, there haven’t been many such periods. Let’s start by looking just at the periods when unemployment was below 4%. Since 1948, unemployment has been this low only on four general occasions. • January 1951 to November 1953, or 35 months. • February 1957 to April 1957, or three months. • February 1966 to December 1969, or 47 months. • April 2000, and September 2000 to December 2000, or five months. So, before mid-2018, there were a grand total of five months since 1970 in which unemployment was under 4%. That's less than 1% of the months over the past half century or so.  Unemployment has also been below 4% between mid-2018 and the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, and also from December 2021 to the present. But the pandemic recession was an oddity caused by an external factor, and it is this recent period of employment that Summers is using to predict the next recession, so it can’t also be used as historic precedent. Meanwhile, this is before we factor in high inflation. We cross-checked the months of sub-4% unemployment with inflation rates and found that none of the five months in 2000 also had inflation above 4%. In other words, during the nearly half-century from 1970 to 2018, there was not a single example of Summers' stated condition — unemployment under 4% and inflation over 4% — ever existing. There are some earlier examples, at least in a limited way. For about a year in 1951, unemployment was under 4% while inflation was above 4%. But inflation then dropped to 1.1% or less for the six months immediately before a recession in 1953, so this is not unequivocal evidence for Summers’ larger point about high inflation being a precursor to a recession. We found only one clear example of Summers’ rule holding — a two-year period in 1968 and 1969 when unemployment was under 4% and inflation was above 4%. That came in the immediate run-up to a recession.  Still, this means there’s just one example of Summers’ rule holding over nearly 75 years of economic data. That’s not exactly ironclad empirical evidence.  This is known in data analysis as the ""small-n"" problem, short for ""small number of examples."" Social scientists and economists generally warn against drawing sweeping conclusions based on small numbers of examples. So what’s going on with Summers’ rule? We didn’t hear back from Summers, but we did hear back from a research collaborator of his, Alex Domash of the Harvard Kennedy School. When Domash walked us through the supporting data, it became clearer to us that the research upon which Summers was basing his formula had more nuances than his talking point to journalists indicated. Domash pointed us to a blog post that is the source of Summers’ talking point. In it, he and Summers examined data similar to what PolitiFact used, although they used quarterly figures rather than monthly figures. A chart in the blog post breaks down the data in some detail. It covers every quarter from 1955 to 2019, or 256 separate quarters. Using the thresholds cited by Summers in his media interviews — inflation above 4% and unemployment below 4% — they found that the likelihood of a recession was 100%. However, these conditions existed only in seven quarters out of 256, or less than 3% of the time. Domash told PolitiFact that the ""small-n"" issue ""is a valid critique,"" and one that he has since sought to improve upon by enlarging the base of research. He said he recently used the same analysis to study 30 member nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of richer nations, and found that low unemployment and high inflation made the probability of an impending recession ""around 90%."" Still, Summers’ offering of a straightforward formula in the media obscures the reality that there’s barely any historical precedent, making it less than a robust method for extrapolating into the future. Summers said, ""When you have unemployment below 4% and inflation above 4%, recession always follows within two years."" His prediction of a future recession is well-supported by economic theory and common sense, and it may come to fruition.  However, his statements in the media go beyond that: They seek to elevate a prediction based theory into an empirical certainty based on lived history. He’s saying that if the current unemployment and inflation rates meet an ironclad threshold, a recession is historically guaranteed. A big reason why the likelihood of a recession is 100% under these conditions is that these conditions almost never occur. During the nearly half-century from 1970 to 2018 — the part of the data set that is most similar to today’s economy — there was not a single example of Summers' stated conditions occurring. That’s not much of a basis for this sweeping formula. We rate his statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2022/jun/23/lawrence-summers/fact-checking-larry-summers-formula-unemploymen/

Kleefisch campaign wrong that Wisconsin had smallest margin in 2020 presidential election
","The 2020 election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden has been an ever-lasting topic for the Wisconsin Republicans running for governor. Indeed, at least one of them is trying to raise money based on how tight the election is, noting money is needed to return a Republican to the governor’s office. ""Joe Biden’s margin of the less than 21,000 votes in Wisconsin was the tightest of any state in 2020,"" former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch noted in a June 8, 2022 email. ""Make no mistake, the Left knows exactly what’s on the line in the Badger State this year."" Was Biden’s win in Wisconsin the tightest of any state? That’s not how we remember it. When asked for backup, Kleefisch’s team said the fundraising email contained an error and should read that the margin in Wisconsin was among the tightest in any state. Alec Zimmerman, communications director for the Kleefisch campaign, said the error was promptly corrected in a follow-up email, but when asked, did not share a corrected email – nor could Milwaukee Journal Sentinel staff members who received the first email find any corrected one in their inboxes. Let’s go to the numbers. According to a December 2020 NPR article, two other states came in with a smaller margin than the 20,682 votes by which Democrat Joe Biden topped then-President Donald Trump in Wisconsin. In Arizona, Biden won by 10,457 votes, and in Georgia, he won by 12,670 votes. In some of the other battleground states, the margins were larger. In Michigan, Biden won by more than 154,000 votes, in Nevada by more than 33,000 and in Pennsylvania by more than 81,000 votes. The situation is similar if you look at the margin by percentage of the vote in the six states, according to a Cook Political analysis of the 2020 election. Here is a look at the states, and the margin by which Biden won the popular vote: Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Wisconsin is one of the most politically competitive states in the country, a fact that held true for the 2020 election. ""But in 2020 Wisconsin was not the tightest in terms of either the raw number of votes or percentage of the vote separating the top two presidential candidates,"" he said in an email. ""By both measures Wisconsin was the third most competitive state in 2020. The margins between Biden and Trump – in terms of both raw votes and the percentage difference between them – were actually tighter in Arizona and Georgia than in Wisconsin."" Kleefisch’s campaign claimed in a fundraising email that Wisconsin’s 2020 margin was the tightest of any state in the country. Though the campaign claimed to have sent a correction to the statement to note the margin was among the tightest, we weren’t able to find any evidence of a correction being sent out. The margin between Biden and Trump in many 2020 battleground states was narrow, but in two states – Arizona and Georgia – it was narrower than Wisconsin.

NC GOP falsely ties dozens of Democrats to single-payer health care plan
","No matter where you live in North Carolina, you’re likely to receive a political mailer about health care. Democratic candidates in North Carolina say the GOP-controlled state legislature hasn’t done enough to improve health care. They say Republicans should at the very least expand Medicaid, which experts have said could help cover up to 500,000 people in the state. Republicans’ main defense is that expanding Medicaid is too expensive and that Democrats want to go several steps further than that. An ad campaign by the state Republican Party says Democrats have a ""radical"" health care agenda that will ""destroy our economy, kill our jobs, take more of your hard-earned dollars in taxes, and infringe on your personal freedoms."" The NC GOP attack on Democrats, which includes digital ads and mailers in districts across the state, is summarized on RadicalDemAgenda.com. The party has purchased internet domain names of Democratic candidates — such as JulieVonHaefen.com — to reach voters. Republican candidates are using the same messaging in ads they pay for. The GOP claim is two-pronged. First, that ""55 liberal members and candidates of the North Carolina Democratic House Caucus signed a pledge to enact an extreme, far-left healthcare agenda."" Second, that ""part of their health care agenda is to force all North Carolinians into a single-payer health insurance scheme. The non-partisan North Carolina General Assembly Fiscal Research staff calculated it would cost North Carolina $72 billion and force all residents to give up their current health care plan."" Did Democrats ""pledge"" to ""force"" North Carolinians into a single-payer health system that would cost $72 billion? Let’s break it down. Single-payer health care The term ""single-payer"" refers to a health insurance system in which the federal government, rather than private insurers, pays all medical expenses. The NC GOP’s claim about a single-payer plan refers to a bill, HB 916, introduced last year that would have studied the cost of creating a single-payer health system. Bill sponsors included House Democrats Cecil Brockman, Verla Insko, Larry Bell, Jean Farmer-Butterfield, Susan Fisher, Charles Graham, Pricey Harrison, Yvonne Holley, Garland Pierce and Bobbie Richardson. It was ignored until this June, when Republican leaders moved it into a committee. Rep. David Lewis, a Republican from Harnett County, then asked the nonpartisan fiscal research staff to calculate the cost of a single-payer health care system in North Carolina. That’s when Insko moved to kill it, saying any analysis of the bill should’ve been completed by the end of last year. It’s also when Richardson took her name off the bill because she didn’t want to be a part of the GOP’s ""political game,"" according to her campaign manager, Taylor Grady-Daly. The cost of a single-payer plan would likely exceed $72 billion per year, according to legislative staff. About $30.1 billion could be paid for with federal dollars, but North Carolina would be responsible for $41.89 billion — nearly double the current general fund budget, The N&O reported. The two-page bill merely directs the legislature to study a single-payer system that its sponsors would like to implement, but the bill doesn’t implement that system on its own. PolitiFact asked the fiscal research staff whether such a system would ""force"" North Carolinians into a single-payer plan. ""The Plan described in the bill does not seem to kick anyone off their current insurance, but it also says ‘all residents shall be covered so I would expect most people would voluntarily drop their existing coverage rather than pay for double coverage,"" said David Vanderweide, a fiscal researcher for the N.C. legislature. While the bill was introduced by nine Democrats, a single-payer health care plan isn’t in the N.C. Democratic Party platform, spokesman Robert Howard noted. Neither is the pledge Republicans reference, Howard added. A pledge: ‘Universal, affordable health care’ The GOP ad refers to a platform pushed by Future Now, a left-leaning advocacy group. The group has seven main goals, which are listed at FutureNow.org and AmericasGoals.org. One of the goals is ""affordable, quality healthcare."" As part of this goal, the group wants to see ""universal, affordable health coverage with a cap on out-of-pocket expenses."" The group thinks reaching this goal could ultimately end hunger and boost life expectancy rates to 84 years. The GOP ad mentions 55 people who signed the pledge to work toward the Future Now goals. The true number is even higher, according to Future Now spokeswoman Alyssa Cass. More than 65 House members are listed on the Future Now website. As for the pledge, there’s an important distinction to be made between single-payer health care and universal health care, said Daniel Squadron, Future Now executive director. One refers to who’s paying for the coverage, while the other refers to how many people are covered. It’s not fair to equate Future Now’s goals with a bill exploring single-payer health care, Squadron said. Future Now supports expanding Medicaid in North Carolina but hasn’t endorsed any specific legislation, Squadron said, adding that the GOP is distorting the truth about his group to scare North Carolinians out of voting for Democrats. ""I would’ve thought that the idea of people across the country having access to health care wouldn’t be controversial,"" he said. ""Apparently for the GOP attacking it, that’s not a valuable goal worth working towards, so that’s surprising and disturbing."" Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the NC GOP, pushed back at the notion that Future Now doesn’t or wouldn’t support a single-payer health care system. Future Now’s founder, Jeffrey Sachs, wrote an op-ed for CNN advocating for a ""Medicare for All"" system along the lines of what Sen. Bernie Sanders has proposed — a single payer plan. ""The economics of Medicare for All championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders are actually quite straightforward,"" Sachs wrote. ""Under what advocates call ‘M4A,’ health care coverage would expand while total spending on health care — by companies, individuals and the government — would decline because of lower costs. More would be paid through the government and less through private insurers."" Woodhouse noted that Squadron, for his part, praised a single-payer health care proposal when he was a state senator in New York and chairman of the Senate Democratic Policy Group. Those statements by Sachs and Squadron, Woodhouse said in an email, show that Democrats ""have signed a pledge to enact universal health care coverage, which by the founders’ own stated opinion would be a single-payer system. All North Carolinians would be forced through massive tax increases to pay into Insko’s radical single-payer proposal."" While Woodhouse argues the terms ""single-payer,"" ""Medicare for all"" and ""universal health care"" all mean the same thing, each term can have a different meaning. The Vox.com news site noted that public support varies for each term. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found a majority of respondents have favorable views of ""Medicare for all"" and ""universal health care."" The term ""single-payer,"" which appears most often in the GOP ads, got far less support. Our ruling The N.C. GOP says part of the Democrats’ agenda is to ""force all North Carolinians into a single-payer health insurance scheme"" that would cost $72 billion. As for implementing a single-payer healthcare system, the GOP is right about the potential cost. But they’re misleading voters about what the bill would do, who supported it and what the Future Now pledge represents. The bill directed a study — not implementation of a single-payer health system. It was sponsored by 10 Democrats and hasn’t been pushed by the party as a whole. The Future Now pledge, meanwhile, doesn’t specifically endorse a single-payer health care system.

Democrat falsely links newly-appointed Republican to health care bill
","Democrats in North Carolina are campaigning on the idea that the GOP-controlled legislature should do more to improve health care in North Carolina. A recent video ad by Sydney Batch, a Democrat running for NC House District 37 in southern Wake County, tries to build off that idea. She’s running against Republican John Adcock, who was appointed to the seat in September. ""John Adcock wants to join politicians who took thousands from insurance companies and support letting them deny health care coverage,"" a narrator in the ad says. ""Their plan would get rid of coverage altogether for thousands of families and raise premiums on the rest of us."" The claims are vague, leaving PolitiFact to wonder which plan by legislative Republicans would eliminate coverage for North Carolina families. The first quote is a reference to Republicans refusing to expand Medicaid, said Benjamin Woods, Batch’s campaign manager. It’s been well-documented that expanding Medicaid in North Carolina could provide coverage for up to 500,000 people. So let’s move on to the second quote. Woods said it refers to legislative Republicans’ ""work to undermine the positive impact of the Affordable Care Act in North Carolina."" Woods referenced a Charlotte Observer editorial about a Republican proposal this summer that would allow nonprofit organizations to offer health benefits to their members. An alternative to the ACA Health benefit plans, which exist in other states but aren’t available in North Carolina, can be cheaper than typical health insurance because they’re not regulated and don’t have to meet financial solvency requirements for sufficient funds to pay customers’ medical bills, The News & Observer reported in June. The plans don’t cover mental health benefits or preventive health services, unlike health insurance regulated under the ACA. (Although, in some cases, customers can pay extra for that coverage.) Critics, including The Charlotte Observer editorial board, fear the nonprofit benefit plans would lure healthy customers away from ACA plans, ""which in turn would force insurers to raise premiums even more to cover the costs of the less healthy folks and elderly who remain on Obamacare."" The Observer’s editorial continued: ""The result: Obamacare will be gutted. So will its preexisting conditions benefit."" The bill’s intention is indeed to provide healthy North Carolinians an alternative to subsidizing insurance for unhealthy people, said David Anderson, a research associate for Duke University’s Margolis Center for Health Policy. ""It’s a cynical dodge, but a legal one,"" Anderson said. And it ""would harm a small group of families who have significant medical conditions."" The plan and Adcock The bill wouldn’t directly eliminate coverage, as the ad suggests. But it could drive up prices for ACA customers, prompting customers with the highest premiums to leave the marketplace altogether. ""You’d probably start seeing price changes if 10,000 to 20,000 (healthy ACA customers) leave the risk pool,"" Anderson said. Eventually, he said, people with pre-existing conditions and the poor ""will have to make the decision between paying the mortgage and paying for insurance."" The bill, however, never became law. And Adcock hasn’t expressed support for it. In an email to PolitiFact, Adcock said he doesn’t know the specifics of the bill. But, ""I know that many Republicans in the State House had many concerns with this bill as written, and I agree with them that the bill in its current form should not pass. ""I think that if non-profit organizations want to offer health insurance to their members, they should be bound by consumer protections and have to cover all of their members, regardless of pre-existing conditions,"" Adcock continued. ""While I’m open to considering a bill authorizing self-funded health benefit plans for non-profit organizations, I would need to review an extensive and objective analysis of its impacts before I could determine if such a bill is in the best interest of my constituents."" Our ruling Batch’s commercial suggests a plan supported by John Adcock and legislative Republicans ""would get rid of coverage altogether for thousands of families and raise premiums on the rest of us."" Her campaign manager cited a bill that would have provided an alternative option to the Affordable Care Act. While that bill could ultimately destabilize the ACA marketplace, causing premiums to rise, it doesn’t directly eliminate coverage. It didn’t have enough support to pass and Adcock says he opposes it. We rate this claim False.

Are black lung cases at a 25-year high?
","Are cases of black lung disease, a scourge of the coal-mining industry, more numerous today than in recent memory? That’s the message of a joint press release by U.S. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va. Black lung disease, also called coal workers' pneumoconiosis, is caused by dusts that are inhaled and deposited in the lungs, which can create scar tissue that makes it more difficult to breathe. The condition can be prevented with appropriate respiratory protection, but once it develops, there is no cure, according to the American Lung Association. The senators’ statement touted legislation to help with the early detection of black lung disease. The legislation requires the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to submit a report to Congress on ways to boost outreach efforts to increase participation in the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program. (We’re checking Manchin rather than Capito because he was the one quoted citing this particular statistic in the news release.) The press release, posted on Manchin’s website on Aug. 23, 2018, said, ""Black lung cases are at a 25-year high, and with today’s technology and our knowledge of this disease, that is simply unacceptable."" Is this correct? We took a closer look. The news release from Manchin and Capito cites a study published by the American Journal of Public Health. The study was produced by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention office in Morgantown, W.Va. Researchers used radiographs collected from 1970 to 2017 to determine the ebb and flow of the disease. The study found that not only have black lung cases increased but also that their prevalence will likely be reflected in future trends of such conditions as progressive massive fibrosis, which refers to masses in the upper pulmonary lobes of the lungs. Here are three charts from the study showing, from left to right, the prevalence of black lung in the United States as a whole; the prevalence in central Appalachia, defined as Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia; and the prevalence in the United States outside of central Appalachia.  These charts show that around 1970, the prevalence of black lung was far higher than it is today — about 30 percent of miners with the longest tenures. That rate fell steadily, and by the late 1990s it had declined to the single digits. But that decline has since reversed. Now, the national prevalence in miners with 25 years or more of tenure exceeds 10 percent, and in central Appalachia, 20.6 percent of long-tenured miners have the disease. Manchin’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Manchin said that ""black lung cases are at a 25-year high."" A scientific study found that the prevalence of black lung disease plummeted between 1970 and the late 1990s, but that the rate has risen since then, although nowhere near its all-time high.

Is African-American, Hispanic poverty at all-time low?
","At a rally in Wheeling, W.Va, President Donald Trump touted record-low poverty rates for minorities in the United States. ""The poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans -- it’s been incredible, they’ve all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country,"" he said at the rally on Sept. 29, 2018. Is this correct? Yes, at least as far back as poverty data has been calculated. First, a refresher on how poverty is calculated. The Census Bureau ""uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty. If a family's total income is less than the family's threshold, then that family and every individual in it is considered in poverty."" While the official poverty line is the same regardless of geography, they are updated yearly for inflation. Non-cash benefits, such as public housing, Medicaid, or food stamps, are not factored into the calculation. We looked at Census Bureau data for the poverty status by race and Hispanic origin from 1966 to 2017. Here’s the full run of that data: In 2017, African-American poverty was 21.2 percent, which was below the previous record low of 21.8 percent the previous year, 2016. (Prior to 2002, data is available only for ""black"" Americans. After that year, data is available for ""black alone"" and ""black alone or in combination."" We used the data for ""black alone or in combination"" for the period in which it is available.) Meanwhile, for Hispanics, the 2017 poverty rate was 18.3 percent, which edged out the previous record low of 19.4 percent in 2016. African-American poverty peaked at 41.8 percent in 1966. Hispanic poverty peaked at 30.7 percent in 1994. While Trump didn’t directly take credit for the decline in his Wheeling remarks, it’s worth noting that the poverty rate had fallen for several years running under his predecessor, President Barack Obama. So the pattern stems from the generally improving economy under both presidents. Trump said, ""The poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans -- it’s been incredible, they’ve all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country."" He’s right that poverty rates hit their historical lows in 2017 since the statistic was first calculated consistently in 1966.

Veterans group attacks Rick Scott's Navy hat, former health care company's fraud settlement
","When disaster strikes in Florida, Gov. Rick Scott dons his Navy cap. Scott served in the Navy back in the 1970s. A left-leaning veterans group used the cap as a jumping-off point in a new attack ad against Scott, saying he cheated veterans when his former health care company defrauded government health care programs. VoteVets endorsed U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson over Scott in the Nov. 6 matchup. ""I see Rick Scott wearing that Navy hat everywhere he goes. But let me tell you what he did to veterans,"" Navy veteran Alan Madison of Vero Beach says in the ad. ""His hospital company stole millions, defrauding the military’s health care program. Scott pled the Fifth and walked away with a fortune. And today he’s worth over 200 million bucks. But veterans like me, we got cheated. A few days later, Scott fired back with a TV ad featuring images of himself wearing, yep, that Navy hat as he toured damage from Hurricane Michael. (Scott joined the Navy in 1979 and served 29 months, ending as a radar technician, according to the Tampa Bay Times.) After touting his hurricane relief efforts, Scott’s ad pivots to Democratic opponent and Sen. Bill Nelson: ""And Sen. Nelson? Running false attack ads mocking Gov. Scott's service in the Navy."" The VoteVets ad is tough, but it isn’t inaccurate. Scott’s former health care company defrauded government health care programs, including Tricare, which serves the military and their families. Scott is wrong to refer to it as an ad by Nelson. ""We have nothing to do with it,"" said Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin. The Medicare fraud case is well documented. Its connection to the military health care program is also real but has been less discussed in Scott’s political campaigns. Scott started what was first Columbia in 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. Over the next decade he added hundreds of hospitals, surgery centers and home health locations. In 1994, Scott’s Columbia purchased Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies. In 1997, federal agents went public with an investigation into the company, focused on whether Columbia/HCA had committed fraud of government programs. Scott resigned as CEO in July 1997, less than four months after the inquiry became public. Company executives said had Scott remained CEO, the entire chain could have been in jeopardy. During his 2010 race, the Miami Herald reported that Scott had said he would have immediately stopped his company from committing fraud — if only ""somebody told me something was wrong."" But there were such warnings in the company’s annual public reports to stockholders, which Scott had to sign as president and CEO. Scott wanted to fight the accusations, but the corporate board of the publicly traded company wanted to settle. (Scott did give a deposition in 2000 in which he invoked the Fifth Amendment multiple times.) In December 2000, the U.S. Justice Department announced that Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines, civil damages and penalties. Assistant Attorney General David Ogden spoke about the claims related to government health care programs, including Tricare. ""We will make sure that crime against the federal government does not pay,"" Ogden said. ""Under today's agreement, HCA is resolving civil claims that the company, generally during the 1990s, engaged in fraudulent billing practices affecting Medicare, Medicaid, the Department of Defense Tricare program and the Federal Employees Health Benefits program."" The Justice Department’s announcement in 2000 stated that Columbia billed government programs for lab tests that were not medically necessary, not ordered by physicians, as well as other violations. The government settled a second series of claims with Columbia/HCA for $881 million. The total for the two fines was $1.7 billion, setting a record at the time. When the government announced the conclusion of the case in 2003, it again mentioned Tricare as one of the government programs defrauded by the company. (The Justice Department’s 2003 press release is shown during the VoteVets ad.) A Pentagon spokeswoman, Major Carla M. Gleason, told us that as a result of the federal government's settlements with Columbia/HCA, Tricare received two recovery payments — one for about $4.7 million and the other for $6.9 million. Gleason said she no longer had direct access to the case files and therefore wasn’t certain if that was the total amount of the fraud against Tricare. We asked the Scott campaign for any evidence to refute the allegations and why his campaign said the VoteVets ad was Nelson mocking Scott’s Navy service. Scott spokeswoman Lauren Schenone didn’t respond directly to those questions. ""Scott took accountability for mistakes his company made,"" Schenone said, ""and made certain every penny that was owed was paid."" But Scott resigned years before the fines were settled. VoteVets said Scott’s ""hospital company stole millions, defrauding the military’s health care program."" Scott stepped down as CEO of Columbia/HCA in 1997 as the federal government was investigating his company. A few years later, the company reached a $1.7 billion settlement with the government for defrauding Medicare and other government programs including Tricare which serves the military.

Budd falsely accuses Manning of getting $30M in taxpayer money
","Republican U.S. Rep. Ted Budd is accusing his Democratic opponent Kathy Manning of benefiting from a development in Greensboro. Budd represents North Carolina’s 13th Congressional District, which covers much of the Greensboro-High Point area as well as the mostly rural area south of Winston-Salem and north of Charlotte. Manning is an attorney, and Budd has criticized her for donating more than $500,000 to the Democratic Party and its candidates. A recent Budd ad, though vague on details, accuses Manning of profiting off a government project. ""A parking deck that nobody needed, benefiting a luxury hotel and Kathy Manning,"" a narrator says in the ad. ""$30 million of your tax dollars plus $2.3 million a year to Kathy Manning and her husband, filling the Manning’s swanky hotel and their own French castle."" It concludes: ""From her castle, it’s no surprise Queen Kathy doesn’t care about doubling parking rates for workers and commuters because Kathy Manning makes government work for her and we pay the price."" Manning called on Budd to remove the ad because, she says, it’s nearly identical to a video ad by the America First Action Super PAC that was removed from a pair of Triad-area radio stations. PolitiFact contacted the Budd campaign about the claim. Budd’s spokeswoman, Elizabeth Oglesby, cited several stories about the Westin Hotel being built in Greensboro by Elm Street LLC. Randall Kaplan, Manning’s husband, is a part of the group. But those stories don’t support the ad’s claims. About the project Kaplan is described as a leader of Elm Street LLC, which is developing the Westin Hotel project. The city of Greensboro agreed to reimburse developers up to $30 million to build a parking deck adjoining the hotel, the Greensboro News & Record reported. The deck is expected to be six stories tall and have 850 parking spaces, according to Jake Keys, communications manager for the city of Greensboro. The $30 million isn’t pure profit for developers. It’s to pay developers to build the deck. That includes material, labor and other costs. ""Under the reimbursement agreement, the developer will build a new public parking deck for the City in conjunction with the development of their hotel project. Once complete, the City will fully own and operate the new public parking deck,"" Keys said in an email. An overestimation The city would own the deck and spend an estimated $2.6 million a year to maintain it and pay down the debt, according to the city’s website. The operating cost will include general deck maintenance, cleaning it and keeping the lights on, Keys said. The city would raise yearly parking spot rental rates from $65 to $128 by 2025, according to another News & Record story provided by the Budd campaign. But that doesn’t go to Kaplan’s group, either, Keys said. ""The City will maintain the deck, thus any amount (whether it is $2.3M or much less) will be completely an internal expense of the City paid for through revenues associated with the deck,"" he wrote. ""In the end, the hotel will pay for parking spaces in the City owned and operated deck just as any other business or individual."" Whatever money Kaplan does receive from the project will be donated to the Community Foundation of Greater Greensboro, the foundation announced on Aug. 21. ""The donations will be used to support a range of charitable programs, including economic and workforce development, health care, education, arts, poverty alleviation and social services in the Central Piedmont region of North Carolina and elsewhere,"" the foundation wrote on its website. Our ruling Budd’s ad said Kathy Manning got $30 million ""of your tax dollars plus $2.3 million a year"" from a luxury hotel and parking lot. While Manning’s husband was involved in the project, Manning was not. And the $30 million represents the entire cost of the parking deck project — not gross profit for Manning or her husband. In fact, Kaplan is donating his profits. And the $2.3 million isn’t going to Manning or her husband’s group, either. We rate this claim False.

The bill stipulates that a driver’s license, Department of Transportation-issued ID, or tribal government-issued ID are acceptable forms of identification, and allows for other documents, such as a utility bill or paycheck, to supplement missing or outdated information. North Dakota is the only state without voter registration, abolishing it in 1951, according to the Secretary of State’s office. A group of eight Native Americans from the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa had already been in a legal battle with the state over voting rights when Burgum enacted Republican-led HB 1369. So, in December 2017, the plaintiffs, represented by attorneys for the Native American Rights Fund, amended their original January 2016 complaint, Brakebill vs. Jaeger, and asked a federal judge to declare the new law unconstitutional. They argued it violates the national Voting Rights Act. The plaintiffs argued that the law was discriminatory because, ""most tribal IDs do not have a residential address printed on them. This is due, in part, to the fact that the U.S. postal service does not provide residential delivery in these rural Indian communities. Thus, most tribal members use a PO Box."" Reached by email, Occupy Democrats told PolitiFact that the organization should have specified in their graphic that Native Americans ""in remote areas"" use PO boxes. ""But we stand by the general veracity of the statement, especially with regards to this specific example in North Dakota,"" Occupy Democrats wrote in the Oct. 18 email. In April, Judge Daniel L. Hovland of the U.S. District Court of North Dakota blocked the bill’s new requirements from being enforced. However, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision, allowing the street address requirement to be implemented in the upcoming midterm elections. In September, the Native American Rights Fund took the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking it to vacate the Eighth Circuit’s decision. Occupy Democrats’ graphic also said, ""The Republican-controlled Supreme Court just said it’s totally okay for North Dakota to demand that ONLY residents with street addresses can vote."" The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on Brakebill vs. Jaeger was 6-2, with justices Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissenting. Newly appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not participate in the decision. It is generally accepted by political scholars, however, that Kavanaugh’s addition to the court means there is a conservative-majority tilt. With the Supreme Court declining to intervene, North Dakota’s voter ID law and its street address requirements will remain in place. However, the U.S. Supreme Court didn’t make a legal determination on the basis of North Dakota’s law. It simply decided not to intervene. The graphic also said, ""Native Americans were the last to get the right to vote, and now they are the first to lose it."" That’s partially accurate, but the timeline of American voting rights is far less cut-and-dried than that statement might suggest. Over the course of history, all but a very small segment of the people who live in the U.S. have had to fight for the right to vote. At the nation’s founding in 1776, only property-owning Protestants over the age of 21 (most of whom were white and male) were given the right to vote. Everyone else had to see laws changed in order to cast a ballot. In 1870, the passage of the 15th Amendment meant that, in theory, African-American men could vote. In 1920, the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote. In 1924, the Indian Citizenship Act gave Native Americans citizenship rights, including the right to vote. And in 1952, the McCarren-Walter Act eliminated laws that prevented Asians from becoming naturalized citizens, which included voting rights. In each case, however, the law on the books didn’t necessarily reflect what was happening when people showed up at their polling places to try to cast a ballot. In reality, Native Americans were turned away from casting ballots in New Mexico and Arizona until 1948, when courts ruled in their favor against state government. In Utah, Native Americans weren’t allowed to vote until 1957, becoming the last of America’s indigenous people to be formally recognized as citizens. But it wasn’t until President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that the United States applied strong legal spackle to the question of voting rights, filling in the many holes and cracks that, for hundreds of years, permitted elections officials to discriminate against citizens who sought to cast a ballot on Election Day. The new law was primarily championed by black Civil Rights leaders, but it ultimately extended protections to people of all backgrounds by prohibiting poll taxes, literacy tests, election fraud and voter intimidation — tactics that had been used to thwart Native Americans from voting. Occupy Democrats’ graphic claimed that because of the Supreme Court’s decision, Native Americans in North Dakota who only have PO boxes will be unable to vote. However, news reports show that tribal officials and a voting rights advocacy group called Four Directions are working with the Secretary of State’s office to pave ways for those who have PO boxes to be able to go to their polling places with other documentation that will allow them to cast their ballots. These include efforts to help residents secure other acceptable forms of ID to present at the polls. The Associated Press on Oct. 19 reported that ""tribal officials can issue a tribal voting letter with the eligible voter's name, date of birth and residential address at polling locations on reservations,"" a proposal that Deputy Secretary of State Jim Silrum said would be considered valid ID. In her dissent, Justice Ginsburg noted that the numbers of North Dakota residents who are affected by this change is significant: ""1) 70,000 North Dakota residents -- about 20 percent of the turnout in a regular quadrennial election -- lack qualifying ID; and 2) approximately 18,000 residents lack supplemental documentation sufficient to permit them to vote without an ID."" That means that voting rights advocates have a huge job ahead of them to ensure those affected by the law are able to go to the polls with acceptable ID. Occupy Democrats said that the U.S. Postal Service only gives tribal residents PO Boxes and that because the Supreme Court decided not to intervene in North Dakota’s voter ID law, Native Americans will lose the right to vote. While rural tribal residents in North Dakota are issued PO Boxes for addresses, it is not true that all tribal residents only have PO Boxes. And a conservative-leaning court did rule to let stand a new North Dakota voter ID law that requires a voter to bring a form of identification with them to the polls that includes their legal name, date of birth and current residential street address — but the new ninth member did not participate. North Dakota’s law does pose obstacles for many tribal citizens who don’t have street addresses. However, through the work of voter rights advocates and officials with the Secretary of State’s office, there are ways that Native American voters who have PO boxes instead of residential street addresses will be able to vote. The law does not mean they are losing their right to vote altogether. The group also said that Native Americans were the last U.S. citizens to be granted the right to vote and the first to lose them. Native Americans in Utah were the last ethnic group to be recognized by both state and federal law as citizens with voting rights. But it wasn’t until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that federal law more thoroughly addressed issues of voter discrimination for all people, giving underrepresented voters of many ethnicities the actual right and means to vote. For a mixed bag of accuracy, we rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2018/oct/23/occupy-democrats/native-americans-werent-last-get-right-vote-occupy/

Does no registration make voting easiest in North Dakota?
","In the first North Dakota Senate debate, incumbent Heidi Heitkamp and Republican challenger and U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer sparred over the fairness of who will get to participate in one of the most hotly contested elections. The moderator asked the two candidates whether they believe the Supreme Court made the right decision in upholding North Dakota’s new voter ID law on Oct. 9. The law requires residents show ID with a current street address. A federal district court in North Dakota originally ruled to allow voters to show either a current street or mailing address, like a PO box. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th circuit put that order on hold. The Supreme Court allowed the hold to stay in place. The case continues before the 8th Circuit. Heitkamp called attention to the law’s disproportionately negative effect on Native American voters, many of whom don’t have a street address and use a PO box instead. ""Our district court judge did the right thing and ruled that this was an inappropriate infringement on voting rights,"" Heitkamp said. ""I hope Native American veterans get an opportunity to vote because they put on a uniform and earned that opportunity."" ""And they do get to vote, Senator,"" Cramer replied. ""That’s the point. The standard for voting in North Dakota is the easiest of anywhere in the country. We are the only state that does not have voter registration."" Cramer is right that there’s no voter registration, unlike any other state. But that doesn’t make North Dakota the easiest state to vote in. ""North Dakota does pretty well and did pretty well from 1996 to 2008,"" said Michael Pomante, a political science professor at Jacksonville University. ""After 2008, that’s no longer the case."" Pomante published a paper in September that ranks the 50 states according to the ease of 33 voting laws alongside two other researchers. They looked at registration requirements, wait times, mail-in ballot options and the strictness of voter ID laws, among other indicators. North Dakota used to be No. 1 because of its lack of voter registration. It ranked fourth in 2016, and Pomante expects it to drop several spots next year because of the new ID law Heitkamp mentioned. He expects other states to jump ahead thanks to automatic registration options when people are in contact with a state agency. In 2016, the researchers determined that voting was easiest in Oregon, where voters are registered automatically and are mailed ballots weeks in advance of election day. Colorado and California came in at second and third, respectively. ""Registering to vote is the biggest determinant of whether or not someone can vote,"" Pomante said. ""So having no registration means you can just show up, and automatic means same thing. Basically the burden of registering to vote is no longer on the individual citizen."" Essentially, having no registration doesn’t make North Dakota all that special anymore. Cameron Wimpy, a political scientist working at the MIT Election Data and Science Lab, said comparison between states with automatic and no registration is difficult because there is little data. The difference, then, comes down to the strictness of laws determining what forms of ID people can show at the polls. ""There is a reality that registration can cause issues. But in the places that registration is easy, it’s hard to believe registration is more difficult than the situation where you have to bring several documents from a limited list,"" Wimpy said. (North Dakota also ranked fourth in the MIT Elections Performance Index in 2016. That ranking did not take voter ID laws into account last year.) The National Conference of State Legislatures breaks down voter ID laws into categories of strict and non-strict, without a ranking. In 2018, North Dakota fell under the strict side of the dividing line. Non-strict states allow at least some voters without an acceptable ID to cast a ballot and have it count. Strict states, like North Dakota this year, require those voters to cast a provisional ballot. In order for their vote to count, they must also take additional steps after election day. Up until 2013, North Dakota citizens could go to the polls and show a single non-photo ID. If they failed to provide such documentation, a poll worker could vouch for the voter’s identity. North Dakota’s sparsely populated rural precincts easily lent themselves to this method. Otherwise, the voter could sign an affidavit at the polling station. That changed when the North Dakota legislative assembly passed a law getting rid of these two fail-safes. The law also limited the forms of acceptable identification. A 2015 law further limited those forms of ID. Seven Native American voters challenged the law in 2016. They argued the statute disproportionately affects Native Americans. The law requires an ID with a valid street address, which many rural tribal members don’t have. According to the plaintiffs, 70,000 North Dakota residents lack a qualifying ID and 18,000 lack supplemental documentation. The lawsuit began a two-year legal battle that is still ongoing. A federal judge issued a temporary order in 2016 that the affidavit remain an option, so North Dakota remained a non-strict state that year. But the strict ID law will be in place this election cycle after the Supreme Court decided not to intervene in October. Tribal officials and Four Directions, a voting rights advocacy group, are working with the Secretary of State’s office to secure acceptable forms of ID for tribal members with only PO boxes. Cramer said, ""The standard of voting in North Dakota is the easiest in the country."" North Dakota ranked near, but never at the top, of any voting ease lists in 2016. The state’s ease of voting is already falling by some metrics ahead of Election Day 2018 with a stricter voting ID law in place, despite North Dakota being the only state without voter registration.

3 months, 3 special sessions. Do they really cost NC an extra $50,000 every day?
","It’s been a hectic few months for North Carolina lawmakers, starting with debate in a special session over six constitutional amendments Republicans had placed on the ballot. A panel of judges then ruled the ballot language for two of these amendments unconstitutional. So another special session of the North Carolina General Assembly was held to rewrite the amendments before elections, over the objections of Democrats. Those weren’t the only special sessions. Gov. Roy Cooper called for another session after Hurricane Florence devastated much of Eastern North Carolina. Taxpayer money is financing these special sessions. And during the second session, some Democrats expressed their displeasure by sharing the daily cost of their work in Raleigh. Rep. Chaz Beasley, a Democrat from Charlotte, tweeted: ""Special Session costs you $50k, every single day. That’s roughly the average teacher’s salary in NC.""   Beasley is not the only one putting this number into the Twitterverse. Another tweet by Lisa Mathis, a Democratic candidate from Sanford, said:  ""Raleigh politician John Sauls is helping to flush another 50k down the drain w/ the #specialsession."" Beasley told PolitiFact he got his information from a WRAL report from 2014. The report says $50,000 is an estimate from Financial Services staff since the General Assembly does not provide what the exact costs are. The actual cost is closer to $42,000, according to figures provided by Paul Coble, the legislative services officer at the General Assembly. Coble sent PolitiFact the cost of operations for the General Assembly from 2005 to 2015. ""An average daily cost of a session is approximately $42,000. This number would be the same for a regularly scheduled day of session, or an ‘extra session,’"" Coble wrote in a letter to PolitiFact. That’s the amount that the state spends in addition to the money it would normally spend when lawmakers aren’t in session. More recent years have been even more expensive. The average daily cost of sessions in the 2014-2015 fiscal year was about $46,000, closer to the number Beasley is using. The information Coble provided does not go beyond June 2015. Politicians have been using the average salary of teachers as a benchmark to compare the daily cost of special sessions. Beasley used the $50,000 number to make the point that it’s about the same as the average North Carolina teacher’s salary in 2018. The average teacher salary is $51,144, according to a report in February 2018 by the state Department of Public Instruction detailing the state education budget. What if we want to compare the cost of session in 2014-2015 to the average teacher salary in the 2014-15 school year? According to the National Education Association, teachers in North Carolina were making about $48,000 at the time. That’s extremely close to cost of session per day. The daily cost of a session goes towards numerous things, such as fiscal research, building maintenance, food services and much more. And as reported by The News and Observer, legislators were being paid $104 for every day they were in session to cover the costs of lodging and food. With the exception of the House and Senate leaders, who are paid $38,151 annually, legislators are paid $13,951 annually. Our ruling The daily cost of operations for the General Assembly, using the most recent numbers available, is about $46,000 if the legislature is in session. That is close to the number Beasley and other Democrats have been using. However, their statements refer to information from almost three years ago, and we have been unable to attain data for this year’s session. And it’s not far off from the average teacher salary. We give this statement a Mostly True rating.

"['Illinois', 'Guns', 'Jeff Sessions']","
Sessions wrong again on Chicago murder spike cause
","Like President Donald Trump, who has claimed Chicago could solve its violence problem ""in a week"" by employing tougher tactics, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions frequently criticizes the city for policies he says hamstring its cops. In a speech to a law enforcement audience in Chicago on Friday, Sessions once again blamed the city’s 2016 spike in murders on an agreement between the Emanuel administration and the American Civil Liberties Union that reined in stop-and-frisk policing. ""As a result of the agreement ... Chicago saw the biggest single-year increase in murders since we’ve had reliable statistics,"" Sessions said. ""Former federal judge Paul Cassell and Professor Richard Fowles of the University of Utah examined what happened here, considered a number of possible causes, and found that the cause of virtually all of the rise in homicides was the ACLU agreement."" We fact-checked Sessions when he made virtually the same claim back in May. It’s still Mostly False. Here’s why. Chicago entered an agreement with the ACLU to end its reliance on stop-and-frisk policing after the civil rights group threatened to take legal action. By 2016, the agreement was in full effect. The agreement followed the release of a report by ACLU’s Illinois chapter that found Chicagoans were stopped more than four times as often as New Yorkers were before that city years earlier reined in its stop-and-frisk policing. The Chicago agreement determined that going forward officers here would be trained to stop people for questioning only when there was a ""reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct."" The city also imposed more thorough documentation requirements for every stop made. Cassell, a former federal judge and current law professor, and Richard Fowles, an economics professor, found that street stops by Chicago police decreased sharply following the agreement — from 40,000 monthly down to less than 10,000 per month. The study attributed the significant uptick in homicides during the same time, from 480 in 2015 to 754 in 2016, to that decline in stops. But experts we spoke with in May pointed to a number of flaws in the study, including its limited time frame and the fact that violent crime has declined or held steady in other cities that have backed away from stop-and-frisk policing. Following the 2016 murder spike in Chicago, murders declined by 15 percent in 2017 — the steepest one-year reduction in nearly 15 years. And that figure is down again for 2018, dropping by a quarter since this time last year, according to data tracked by the Chicago Tribune. Those declines occurred even though the city continues to follow the agreement with the ACLU. Sessions’ argument is also weakened by the results in other cities that have taken similar steps to those in Chicago. During his remarks, Sessions held up New York as a law enforcement success story, pointing to significant progress made in tamping down violent crime there over the last few decades. ""Last weekend there were zero murders in New York City for the first time in 25 years,"" Sessions said. ""In fact, there were no shootings at all in New York City last weekend."" Sessions is right that today’s New York is much less violent than in years’ past. But the Big Apple makes for a curious pick in defending stop-and-frisk. A federal judge ruled in 2013 that the way NYPD officers were stopping New Yorkers was unconstitutional, requiring them to change tactics. Even prior to the verdict, the department’s reliance on street stops was in decline. By the end of 2013, stops by police had plummeted from a 2011 high of more than 200,000 to 12,500. By Sessions’ logic, curtailing stop-and-frisk should have triggered a murder spike like Chicago’s. Yet murders in New York have declined or held steady in the years since the federal ruling. Newark, Seattle and Philadelphia have also limited police stops in recent years without a corresponding jump in murders. Meanwhile, even when Chicago was still stopping individuals at four times the rate of New York’s peak, gun seizures here dropped, detectives solved fewer murders and a decade-long decline in gun violence came to an end, a 2016 WBEZ investigation found. The Utah research report that underpins Sessions’ conclusions blames the upsurge in murders on the ACLU agreement but dismisses any possibility it could be related to the intense local reaction to the late 2015 release of police dashcam footage that showed officer Jason Van Dyke shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times. Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder earlier this month. In response to the fallout from the video’s release, Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired police chief Garry McCarthy in late 2015. McCarthy, who came to Chicago by way of the Newark and New York police departments, ran the Chicago department during the years when stops in this city outpaced New York’s. Sessions said an agreement between the city of Chicago and the ACLU caused ""virtually all of the rise in homicides"" in 2016. His claim repeats a finding from a University of Utah study that attributed Chicago’s 2016 murder spike to an agreement between the city and the civil rights group meant to rein in the city’s stop-and-frisk tactics. Chicago’s murder toll did skyrocket that year, though it has declined since. The study has been criticized for its methods and for excluding other factors that could have played a role. There is an element of truth in Sessions’ claim, but it also ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Just like last time, we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/oct/23/jeff-sessions/sessions-wrong-again-chicago-murder-spike-cause/

Brat misstates Spanberger's stance on 'Medicare for All'
","U.S. Rep. Dave Brat keeps telling voters in Virginia’s 7th Congressional District that Democratic challenger Abigail Spanberger wants a $32 trillion tax increase to pay for a ""government takeover of health care."" You don’t have to look hard to find his claims. ""My opponent wants a tax increase of $32 trillion -- that's with a  'T' -- to pay for her socialist healthcare plan,"" Brat, a Republican, wrote in a Oct. 11 Facebook post. ""She and Nancy Pelosi want to...double down for a $32 trillion socialized takeover, government takeover, of health care,"" he said during and Oct. 15 debate with Spanberger. ""And we know Spanberger’s health care plan would bankrupt Medicare as we know it - a $32 trillion spending increase that would double our taxes,"" says a Brat TV ad that debuted on Sept. 17. ""Spanberger’s healthcare piece costs $32 trillion and will require you doubling the personal income tax rate - your personal taxes doubled - and the corporate rates doubled,"" Brat said during an Aug. 20 radio interview on the John Frederick Show, Spanberger has repeatedly denied Brat’s charge. So we decided to test Brat’s claim - that Spanberger wants a $32 trillion tax increase to pay for an overhaul of health care - on the Truth-O-Meter. Brat’s Explanation Brat says his claim stems from a comment Spanberger made during a May 31 debate with Dan Ward, her opponent in this spring’s Democratic primary. The candidates were asked for their ""feelings about single-payer healthcare,"" a system in which one entity - the government - is responsible for providing health insurance and paying claims. Brat notes that Spanberger, in reply, said, ""...I do, in principle, support single payer…"". Brat says those words prove Spanberger supports the Medicare for All Act of 2017, proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The bill, which is languishing in the Senate Finance Committee, would create a Medicare program that covers all Americans under one plan. Employers would be barred from offering competing insurance. Sanders’ plan would cover primary care, hospital visits, lab services, medical devices, maternity care, prescriptions and vision and dental care. The only copayments would be for prescriptions. The Mercatus Center, a free-market oriented research group at George Mason University, estimated Sanders’ plan would cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years. ""A doubling of all currently projected federal individual and corporate income tax collections would be insufficient to finance the added federal costs of the plan,"" the study, published in July 2018, said. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has not published a cost analysis of Sanders’ plan. Brat has company among Republicans in claiming Spanberger endorsed Sanders’ plan.  The Congressional Leadership Fund, a GOP super PAC aligned to Speaker Paul Ryan, has run a TV ad that accuses Spanberger of ""supporting a $32 trillion government takeover of healthcare and raising middle-class taxes."" Full picture Spanberger, in answering the debate question, only briefly addressed a single-payer  system. She spent most of her energy calling for the passage of Medicare X, a health care proposal that would give people under 65 an option: They could remain privately insured, or buy into a new government-run program that would use the network of Medicare providers and costs. The Medicare system is now reserved for elderly and disabled citizens. Brat focuses on one clause in Spanberger’s answer. Here’s a fuller excerpt of her  remarks.   ""I support Medicare X, which is a public option as a path towards universal coverage in the achievement of universal coverage. I believe that a public option is the way that we can achieve that goal through government-provided insurance that does, in fact, build off the existing Medicare network, because it exists in every single zip code across the country and that is the way we can achieve health care for everyone. And I do, in principle, support single-payer, but I believe universal coverage through a public option is the method I would pursue."" Spanberger never mentioned Sanders. Nor was the senator referenced by the questioner or in the response by Ward - Spanberger’s primary opponent. This is important because Brat not only accuses Spanberger of championing a single-payer system, he links her to Sanders’ proposal and its costs.The Mercatus Center, a libertarian research organization affiliated with George Mason University, estimates Sanders’ plan would cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years and wouldn’t be paid for even if income and corporate taxes were doubled. Sanders’ plan is very generous. It would cover hospital visits, primary care, medical devices, lab services, maternity care, prescriptions as well as vision and dental care. It would not subject consumers to any out-of-pockets costs, except a copay on prescriptions. But if Congress wanted to, it could pass a single-payer system that would be cheaper than Sanders’ plan, albeit still costly. For example, some single-payer countries require copays for medical treatment, some have don’t cover dental and eye care, others don’t cover long-term care. In other words, it’s possible to support ""in principle"" a single payer system but be opposed to Sanders’ plan. Spanberger repeatedly has said she’s against Sanders’ bill and denounced Brat’s attack as ""false."" It’s a mystery what she meant when she said she supports single payer ""in principle."" We found no evidence of her making a similar statement. When we asked Justin Jones, spokesman for Spanberger’s campaign, to explain the remark, he said, ""She hasn’t seen any single-payer plan she supports."" He wouldn’t elaborate. Brat says Spanberger changed her position on Sanders’ bill after an Aug.3 editorial in the Richmond Times-Dispatch criticized its $32.6 trillion estimated cost and said the measure would lead to ""socializing medicine."" The editorial didn’t mention Spanberger. Final Note: Medicare X has not been subjected to a rigid cost analysis. Supporters say it would at least break even because the bill requires that premiums ""cover the full actuarial cost of offering such a plan, including administrative costs."" A 2013 CBO study concluded a similar program would reduce federal deficits by $158 billion over 10 years. Our Ruling Brat says Spanberger ""wants a tax increase of $32 trillion - that’s with a `T,’to pay for her socialist health care plan."" The charge - central to Brat’s campaign - stems from Spanberger’s May 2018 comment that she does ""in principle, support"" a single-payer health system. Brat offers that statement as proof that Spanberger backs a very generous single-payer proposal proposed by Sen. Sanders of Vermont in which all health insurance would come the federal government. Spanberger has caused some confusion because she’s never explained her remark. It is possible, however, to be receptive to a single-payer program that’s cheaper and more limited than Sanders’ plan. Brat offers no evidence that Spanberger has endorsed Sanders’ plan, and she says she opposes it. On the other hand, Spanberger has repeatedly backed a Medicare X proposal that would allow the government to compete with private insurers. Unlike Sanders’ plan, people would retain choices on where to buy coverage. Brat conveniently has chosen a position for Spanberger that she never took. We rate his statement False.  ",/factchecks/2018/oct/23/dave-brat/brat-misstates-spanbergers-stance-medicare-all/

Fact-checking Kathy Manning’s ad on Ted Budd and pre-existing conditions
","Two years ago, Republicans were attacking Democrats for backing the Affordable Care Act. But the tables have turned. These days, Democrats across the country are citing the popularity of the ACA, also known as Obamacare, and blasting Republicans for their repeated efforts to chip away at it. In North Carolina’s 13th Congressional District, which includes Statesville, High Point and parts of Greensboro, a 30-second television ad from Democratic congressional candidate Kathy Manning targets incumbent Republican Rep. Ted Budd for his vote on a ""repeal and replace"" bill. The ad cites the case of a woman named Lilly who ""worked her way through UNC while living with a tumor that radiation and surgery could not cure."" ""But Lilly’s congressman, Ted Budd, voted to gut protections for pre-existing conditions like hers, letting insurance companies deny coverage for the treatment she needs,"" the ad says. Budd is not the first Republican to see this attack. In the last several weeks, PolitiFact’s state affiliates have awarded Half True ratings to nearly identical ads and statements from Democrats in Wisconsin, Florida, Virginia and California. Manning’s ad has been active on Facebook for more than a month, and the Manning campaign even set up a special website to showcase it. So we decided to give it a fresh look and see how it stacks up against the facts. The Manning campaign declined to comment, but its website cited articles from Time, CNN and the AARP to back up the claim. The website noted that the vote in question was related to the American Health Care Act of 2017, a Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare. The AHCA, as the bill was called, passed the House with a 217-213 margin before ultimately failing in the Senate. The AHCA would have retained some components of Obamacare while eliminating the individual mandate and making other modifications. Budd voted yes on the AHCA, and while it did not allow states to refuse coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, it did open the door for insurers to hike premiums for those people under certain circumstances. Specifically, an April 2017 amendment from Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., would have allowed states to apply for waivers to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act. As PolitiFact noted in its guide to the MacArthur amendment, the amendment would have let states seek waivers from the AHCA’s ""continuous coverage"" provision, which was supposed to require that Americans continuously carry health insurance or else face higher premiums for one year. Insurers in states receiving waivers would have been permitted to consider a person’s health status when setting premiums in the individual market for the year of penalty. In other words, they would have been able to raise the premiums, for one year, of a person with a pre-existing condition so long as that person had been uninsured for 63 consecutive days the previous year. Currently under Obamacare, premiums can only vary based on certain conditions, such as age, location or tobacco use. Any person without employer or government-provided health insurance is guaranteed access to coverage in the individual market — regardless of his or her health status — and cannot be charged a higher rate because of a pre-existing condition. Elizabeth Oglesby, Budd’s campaign manager, said Manning’s claim about protections for pre-existing conditions was inaccurate. ""Not one person would be denied health insurance for pre-existing conditions, and (Manning) should apologize for her false, smear campaign and take down her ad,"" she said. Indeed, the MacArthur amendment explicitly stated that ""nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions."" But there’s more nuance to unpack here. As we mentioned before, the amendment would have allowed insurers to consider pre-existing conditions when writing policies for people who had lapses in their coverage the previous year. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that could mean that 6.3 million people could have faced higher premiums under the AHCA because of pre-existing health conditions. That’s a significant number, but a small portion of the estimated 50 to 120 million people under 65 with pre-existing conditions. That means somewhere between 4 and 13 percent of people under 65 with pre-existing conditions could have experienced heightened premiums under the AHCA. As PolitiFact has noted before, many low-income people have trouble staying covered without lapses, and the waiver system could have led insurers to drive premiums too high for these people during penalty years. The ACHA would have appropriated $8 billion over five years to assist people who could not afford the penalty premiums. The waivers would have also allowed states to set up high-risk pools or participate in a federal invisible risk-sharing program to reimburse insurers for taking on high-risk individuals.   But it’s not clear how effective either measure would have been. In a press release, the American Medical Association warned that the AHCA’s waiver program ""could make coverage unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions.""   That’s why, when President Donald Trump and North Carolina Republican Rep. Robert Pittenger said the AHCA included coverage for pre-existing conditions, PolitiFact gave them both Mostly False ratings. Manning’s ad said Ted Budd ""voted to gut protections for pre-existing conditions … letting insurance companies deny coverage for the treatment (Lilly) needs."" The bill included a line stating that insurers would not have been allowed to restrict access to healthcare for people with pre-existing conditions. But in a limited way, the AHCA would have rolled back protections for pre-existing conditions by letting some insurers raise premiums based on a person’s health status under certain circumstances. This could have led to somewhere between 4 and 13 percent of people under 65 with pre-existing conditions facing higher premiums.   Overall, Manning’s ad is partially accurate, but leaves out important details and context. We rate this statement Half True. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

Donald Trump says Democrats want to give cars to undocumented immigrants. Nope
","Want a free car? President Donald Trump has told his audiences that undocumented immigrants are in luck, if the Democrats have their way. In an Oct. 19 rally in Mesa, Ariz., Trump said, ""Democrats want to give illegal aliens free welfare, free health care, and free education. Give them a driver's license. Give them a driver's license. Next thing you know, they want to buy them a car. Then they'll say the car's not good enough, how about a Rolls-Royce?"" The hypothetical morphed into something more the following day at a rally in Elko, Nev. No longer was this idea simply the ""next thing"" Democrats were going to dream up — by then, the Democratic proposal he mentioned had purportedly already surfaced. Referring to Democrats, Trump said, ""They want to take away your Second Amendment. They want to raise your taxes. They want to open your borders — let people in, illegally. And then they want to pay for those people for health care, for education. They want to give them cars, they want to give them driver's licenses. I said last night — we did a great, great rally in Arizona last night — and I said last night, what kind of car will they supply them? Will it be a Rolls-Royce?"" Twelve states have indeed chosen to offer driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants, which cannot be used for federal identification purposes. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, they are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Vermont and Washington, along with the District of Columbia. Typically, an applicant must provide certain documents to obtain one, such as a foreign birth certificate, a foreign passport, or a consular card, along with evidence of current residency in the state. (Many of these states are solidly Democratic in their leanings, though some such as Nevada and New Mexico are mixed, and Utah is solidly Republican.) But cars? That’s fantasy. Based on Google and Nexis searches, we found no indication that any Democratic official had proposed giving free cars to undocumented immigrants, be it a Rolls-Royce or a clunker. ""I’ve never heard any plan to give illegal immigrants cars at taxpayer expense,"" said Alex Nowrasteh, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute who closely tracks legislative proposals on immigration. Asked whether he’d heard any of discussion of this idea among congressional Democrats, Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Trump’s remark was ""fiction."" We reached out to the White House but did not receive a reply. Trump said that Democrats ""want to give (undocumented immigrants) cars."" There is no evidence for this.

In attack on Scott Walker, Tony Evers misleads in claiming health care costs 50% more in Wisconsin
","Continuing a series of attacks on Republican Gov. Scott Walker on health care, Tony Evers compares Wisconsin to Minnesota with a TV ad released Oct. 9, 2018. The state schools superintendent, who is the Democratic challenger to Walker in the Nov. 6, 2018 election, uses a woman who describes her experience with Stage 4 breast cancer. She accuses Walker of wanting to play politics rather than deal with health care costs. Then the claim we want to check is made. This statement appears on the screen, as the woman speaks nearly the same claim: ""Wisconsin pays 50% more than Minnesota for the same health care."" So, with that statement, which is broad, Evers doesn’t directly blame Walker. But in the context of the ad, Evers at least suggests that the governor has failed to tackle what he claims is a drastic difference in costs between neighboring states. Evers’ claim has an element of truth, but it’s misleading in that it is overly broad. Join us for a free PolitiFact event in Milwaukee. Let’s start by noting that Evers made a similar claim earlier in the campaign. He said Walker refused federal funds and ""Wisconsin families now pay nearly 50 percent more than Minnesotans for the same health care."" Our rating was Mostly False. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. In that earlier claim, Evers talked about families when the data he cited to back up his statement was on individuals. But the bigger problem was that Evers blamed the cost difference on Walker’s refusal to accept additional federal aid to do an expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), when many factors were at work, as experts told us then: 1. Other factors that determine premiums include reinsurance, risk pool differences and competition between insurers and providers, said a health care expert at the nonpartisan Urban Institute. 2. ""It is just challenging to draw hard and fast conclusions when you’re just comparing one state to another, because states can have very different policy and market dynamics,"" a Georgetown University expert said. Evers has similar problems with the statement we’re checking now. As he did in his earlier claim, Evers in his new claim relies on data from a gold-standard source on health care, the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation. A table of data entitled ""Marketplace Average Benchmark Premiums"" shows the 2018 premium as $569 in Wisconsin $385 in Minnesota. That’s a difference of 48 percent, nearly what Evers claims in the ad. But Evers’ claim is broad -- and the premium data he cites is narrow. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. Kaiser gathered figures for the second-lowest-cost silver premium for a 40-year-old in each county who buys individual insurance through the state and federal marketplaces that were created after the Affordable Care Act. So, we’re talking a relatively small slice of everyone who buys health insurance  — individuals who buy it on their own. In contrast, most non-elderly people get their health coverage through an employer-based plan. And many people, including the elderly, are covered by programs such as Medicare or Medicaid. Broader measures can paint a different picture. For example, Walker’s campaign also cites Kaiser research, but on a measure involving more people — the average annual family premium per enrolled employee for employer-based health insurance. For 2017, the employee contribution in Minnesota was $4,998, slightly higher than the $4,842 in Wisconsin. Evers says: ""Wisconsin pays 50% more than Minnesota for the same health care."" On one measure — how much 40-year-old individuals pay for health insurance they buy on their own — the annual average premium is nearly 50 percent higher in Wisconsin than in Minnesota. But Evers’ statement is broad, and that measure is narrow, given that the vast majority of people get their health insurance through an employer or from the government. By one measure of employer-provided health insurance, the average annual premium paid by employees was actually 3 percent higher in Minnesota than in Wisconsin. Moreover, Evers suggests Walker has failed to address health care costs, when many factors are involved, especially in an apples-to-oranges comparison of two states. Evers’ statement has only an element of truth and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression — our definition of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/oct/22/tony-evers/attack-scott-walker-tony-evers-misleads-claiming-h/

Katie Porter has called for immigration reform, but not to abolish ICE
","U.S. Rep. Mimi Walters connected her challenger Katie Porter to Democrats who have voiced support for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE. But how true is Walters’ attack? The mailer from Walters to residents of California’s 45th Congressional District claims the ""press has reported that Katie Porter is part of a radical group of Democrats running for Congress"" and says she has an ""extreme agenda"" that supports abolishing ICE. It goes on to criticize Porter for supporting sanctuary city laws and that she wants free college and Medicare for illegal immigrants. For the purposes of this fact-check, we focused on the claim that Porter’s agenda includes abolishing ICE. It actually doesn’t. The Walters campaign told us that the ICE charge comes from a McClatchy DC bureau article from Sept. 14. But the news story doesn’t back up the mailer’s claim. McClatchy reported that Porter is part of a ""battery"" of ""even more liberal"" candidates pushing for single-payer health care and abolishing ICE. The original version of the article had a sentence that said Porter and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York have both ""pushed the ideological envelope for the party’s progressive wing, even popularizing once-radical positions like single-payer health care or abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency."" This line was featured on the mailer. However, that reference was updated and clarified in the story three days later. (We spoke with McClatchy reporter Alex Roarty, who confirmed the change.) The section now reads that the candidates have ""pushed the ideological envelope for the party’s progressive wing. Porter has embraced the once-radical position of single-payer health care while Ocasio-Cortez supports abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency."" Perhaps a minor alteration in the story, but it’s a big hit on the accuracy of the mailer’s claim that Porter wants to abolish ICE. Democrats have argued in the past that ICE, which formed in the aftermath of 9/11, needs to be abolished to prevent mistreatment of undocumented immigrants. But the notion gained new life over the summer amid stories of migrant children being separated from their families at the U.S. border. Porter’s campaign said she does not want to abolish ICE. We did not find evidence that she has called for ending the agency like some other candidates. The campaign pointed us to a Mercury News article from August. The story discusses how none of the Democrats running in the 10 most competitive House races in California support dissolving the agency, citing a survey of the candidates. It then lists each candidate’s comments on ICE, and quotes Porter saying that the immigration agency ""should be focused on its core public safety mission, not targeting families. The real issue here is the failure of Donald Trump’s leadership."" On her campaign website, Porter says that she believes the U.S. needs immigration reform ""that will provide a fair pathway to citizenship for those who are undocumented."" Walters claimed that Porter has an extreme liberal agenda that supports abolishing ICE. The mailer relies on a news article that said she supports such actions, but that piece has since been updated, stopping short of saying the Democrat wants to do away with the agency and mentioning her position for single-payer health care instead. We also found comments from Porter expressing frustration with the agency, and that she supports changes to it, but not dissolving it completely. The claim is inaccurate, so we rate it False.",/factchecks/2018/oct/22/mimi-walters/katie-porter-has-called-immigration-reform-not-abo/

No, Hillary Clinton wasn’t fired during the Watergate investigation
","Hillary Clinton isn’t running for office but she’s still grist for the GOP mill, so it should come as no surprise that an old claim about her credibility is making the rounds running up to the midterms. Clinton was featured in an old photo that was first posted to Facebook on Oct. 9, 2016 and is still gathering comments, shares and reactions. ""In Case Y’all Forgot!!!!"" the caption to the photo began, ""As a 27 year old staff attorney for the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate investigation, Hillary Rodham was fired by her supervisor, lifelong Democrat Jerry Zeifman."" The words surrounded a printed picture of Clinton from back in 1974, when impeachment charges were brought against then-President Richard Nixon. The post continued: ""When asked why Hillary Rodham was fired, Zeifman said in an interview, ‘Because she was a liar. She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer, she conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the Committee, and the rules of confidentiality.’"" The person who posted the picture wrote on her Facebook page that it was a news clipping she saved 20 years ago. This particular post dates back to October 2016, when Clinton was the Democratic presidential nominee, but as of this week, it’s been shared more than 253,000 times with people continuing to comment today. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Though the person who posted the image didn’t respond to a message seeking more information, they’re not alone in circulating the allegation. Clinton was one of dozens of attorneys hired by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee in 1972 to work on the Watergate impeachment inquiry. Zeifman, who was Democratic general counsel to the committee during the Watergate scandal, died in 2010, so we can’t ask him if he fired her because she was a liar. But other people have. In 1999, Lance Gay reported for the Scripps Howard News Service that Zeifman didn’t have ""flattering memories"" of Clinton’s work on the committee. ""If I had the power to fire her, I would have fired her,"" Gay quotes Zeifman as saying. Gay also interviewed Jay Woods, an Oakland attorney who supervised the lawyers, for the story. Gay, who described Woods as Clinton’s ""ex-boss,"" reported that he described her as capable and cheerful. Less than a decade later, Zeifman changed his story, according to the Washington Post. In a 2008 interview on ""The Neal Boortz Show,"" fact-checker Glenn Kessler reports, Zeifman was asked directly if he fired her. ""Well, let me put it this way,"" he said. ""I terminated her, along with some other staff members who were — we no longer needed, and advised her that I would not — could not recommend her for further positions."" That year, an article by Dan Calabrese, founder of North Star Writers Group, claimed Zeifman was Clinton’s supervisor and had fired her. Clinton, who was making her first run for president that year, denied the allegation. Calabrese also quotes Zeifman as making the same statement that appears in the Facebook post. But Zeifman’s credibility has been questioned over the years. In a 1996 review of his book, ""Without Honor: Crimes of Camelot and the Impeachment of President Nixon,"" Washington Post reviewer Matthew Dallek notes that Zeifman’s book ""will surely excite conspiracy buffs on the lookout for sinister coverups in high places. But those wary of such unsubstantiated theories (myself included) will find Zeifman’s book an unconvincing, if imaginative intrigue."" Snopes points out that Zeifman didn’t claim he fired Clinton in that book; it wasn’t until later that his recollection changed. Perhaps the best proof of whether Clinton was fired or not is in her pay records. Judiciary Committee pay records that were unearthed in 2016 by Washington Post researcher Alice Crites show that Clinton was paid through Sept. 4, 1974—after Nixon resigned on Aug. 9, 1974, and after the committee published its final impeachment report on Aug. 20, 1974.
