Overdose deaths up 35% in Virginia
","Del. John McGuire, R-Goochland, recently cited ""failed leadership"" by Democrats in curbing drug overdoses as one of the reasons why he had announced his candidacy in next year’s race for the 7th District congressional seat. ""Overdoses in Virginia (are) up 35%,"" he said in a Dec. 3 radio interview on WRVA in Richmond.  McGuire pointed blame at Democratic President Joe Biden and said U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the two-term Democratic incumbent in the 7th District, has been ineffective on these issues. ""She’s not there,"" he said. Since his comments, both McGuire’s and Spanberger political plans have been thrown in the air. A new redistricting map, submitted to the state Supreme Court for approval by a Democratic and Republican special master, placed each politician’s home outside of the 7th District. At this writing, Spanberger has not announced her plans. McGuire says he’ll wait for the political maps to be approved before making a decision. McGuire’s claim about soaring Virginia drug overdoses remains relevant, however. We fact-checked his statement and found the state has seen at least a 35% increase in drug deaths during the 12 months between April 2020 and April 2021. But McGuire’s effort to blame Democrats for the overdose surge in Virginia and across the nation does not statistically hold up. McGuire’s campaign told us his overdose data comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which receives monthly reports on the number of drug deaths in each state.  The latest figures show Virginia had 1,660 overdose deaths during the year before the end of April 2020. That rose to 2,034 fatalities over the next year ending in April 2021 - a 23% increase.  McGuire, however, is citing a ""predicted number"" from the CDC - a monthly estimate the agency produces for each state because drug deaths often require lengthy investigations before being confirmed, creating a backlog. The CDC estimates that Virginia’s actual yearly overdose deaths rose from 1,669 during the year ending in April 2020 to 2,262 in the year ending in April 2021. That 35.5% increase  jibes with McGuire’s statement. Nationally, the CDC estimates that drug deaths rose nationally by 28.5%, from 78,056 in the 12 months preceding April 2020 to 100,306 during the year ending in April 2021.  Virginia’s Department of Health uses a broader definition of overdose deaths than the CDC and says state drug fatalities increased from 1,681 during the year ending March 31, 2020 to 2,543 in the year ending March 31, 2021 - a 51% rise. Experts say the main reason for the increase in Virginia and nationally is the spread of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is many times more powerful than heroin. It is increasingly interlaced with other illicit drugs and some people may not have even been aware that they used it. Virginia’s increase above the national average suggests a high presence of fentanyl in the state, according to Kathrin ""Rosie"" Hobron, statewide forensic epidemiologist for the Virginia’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. She also tied the increase to the coronavirus pandemic.  ""I talk to the treatment folks and they say during the lockdown, fewer people were going into treatment programs,"" Hobron said. ""There’s been a lot of insecurity about losing jobs and financial issues that might be pushing people towards drug use."" McGuire lays the overdose surge at Biden’s feet, but the numbers don’t back him up. The national opioid epidemic precedes the Biden administration as does the recent uptick. CDC figures show national drug deaths increased by 29% percent during 2020, the last full year of Republican President Donald Trump’s administration. The agency estimates Virginia overdoses increased 42% that year. McGuire says, ""overdoses in Virginia (are) up 35%."" He accurately relays CDC statistics that estimate state drug deaths rose by 35.5% from April 2020 to April 2021. The Virginia Department of Health, which uses a broader definition of overdose deaths than the CDC, says drug fatalities increased 51% from April 2020 to March 2021. But McGuire’s context - blaming Biden for the surge - is a reach. The CDC estimates overdoses rose 29% nationally and 42% in Virginia during Trump’s last year in office and continued to rise during the first months of Biden's adminstration. We rate McGuire’s claim Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2021/dec/14/john-mcguire/overdose-deaths-35-virginia/

Sen. Graham’s false claim about Build Back Better adding $3 trillion in deficits
","Republicans have been highlighting a recent government estimate of what they say is the true cost of the Democrats’ Build Back Better bill, which includes major spending on child care and child tax credits.  On Fox News Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told departing host Chris Wallace that the bill is far more expensive than Democrats claim, and the money it raises falls trillions short of covering the cost. ""The Congressional Budget Office says it's not paid for,"" Graham said Dec. 12. ""It's $3 trillion of deficit spending."" Graham is incorrect. The bill passed by the House and now in the Senate’s hands costs about $1.75 trillion, and, according to CBO figures, would add $158 billion to the deficit over 10 years, not $3 trillion. (President Joe Biden and other Democrats say even that smaller deficit would evaporate thanks to IRS crackdowns on tax evaders.) Graham is saying the deficit would be 20 times larger than the bill at hand. That’s like the difference between a grape and a big cantaloupe. So, what is Graham talking about? Graham and his Republican counterpart in the House asked the CBO to estimate what would happen if temporary spending programs in the legislation were extended through 2031. The major spending provisions include a bigger child tax credit and support for child care. Graham’s press office sent us a Dec. 10 letter from the CBO. The agency did say the deficit would go up by $3 trillion, but that was for, as they put it, ""a modified version of H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act."" Modified means the CBO scored a bill that’s different from the one on the table. ""These estimates do not reflect what is actually written in the Build Back Better Act nor its official cost for scorekeeping purposes,"" the deficit hawk group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote. ""Lawmakers may choose to allow some provisions to expire, to extend some as written, and to modify some."" To unpack this — just a little bit — Congress passed a budget resolution that set a ceiling on how much, if any, a bill like Build Back Better could add to the deficit.  When the CBO scored the bill as adding $158 billion to the deficit, the Democrats were well below the ceiling they had set. (Technically, the CBO said the bill added $365 billion, but it also figured that IRS enforcement would help offset that by $207 billion.) Those CBO estimates have legal power. If they show that a bill exceeds the limits in the budget resolution, any senator can call for a higher hurdle 60-vote supermajority to move it forward. To keep costs in check, Democrats made a number of programs temporary. In dollars, a one-year increase in the child tax credit is the biggest example. As passed, that provision added $185 billion to the deficit. It ends after 2022, but if it lasted through 2031, it would add nearly $1.6 trillion. Other big ticket items in the Democratic package are the subsidies for child care and preschool (ending after 2027), raising the limit on state and local tax deductions (ending after 2025), and health insurance subsidies (ending after 2025 and 2026). While there would be political pressure to extend some or all of these changes, there’s no way to predict today what would happen. Certainly, if Republicans were successful in the 2022 midterm elections, they would likely have the clout to defeat any effort to extend them if they wanted to. Former CBO director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, head of the American Action Forum, a right-of-center policy group, said it’s commonplace for lawmakers in the minority party to ask the CBO to score something that isn’t in a bill. Holtz-Eakin said he received and fulfilled those requests all the time. Unlike the CBO estimates of actual legislation, those what-if estimates have no weight except for purposes of debate and offering amendments. As for the tactic of making certain provisions temporary to contain the overall cost of a bill, that’s something Republicans have used themselves. In the Republicans’ 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, individual income tax cuts ended after 2025. Graham voted for that bill. ""Their budget resolution said you can’t add more than $1.5 trillion in deficits in the budget window,"" Holtz-Eakin said. ""They were going to do that, so they sunsetted provisions of the income tax, along with a few other provisions."" In 2017, the CBO told Congress that the Tax Cut and Jobs Act would add a bit over $1.45 trillion to the deficit. That was the estimate before the vote to pass the bill. In reality, the law has ended up adding nearly $2 trillion to the deficit. Graham said the CBO predicted the Build Back Better Act would add $3 trillion to deficits over 10 years. He’s referring to a bill that’s not the Build Back Better Act. At Graham’s request, the CBO looked at the impact of extending the temporary programs in the bill for a full 10 years. That is an assessment of a hypothetical situation, not the bill at hand.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/dec/14/lindsey-graham/sen-grahams-false-claim-about-build-back-better-ad/

Vancouver hospital did not see a surge in stillbirths among women vaccinated for COVID-19

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There was not a surge of stillbirths at Lions Gate Hospital. The company that operates the facility, Vancouver Coastal Health, said in a tweet that the information is false and ""there has been no notable change to the incidence of stillbirths in the VCH region throughout the COVID-19 pandemic."" In fact, the seven hospitals operated by Vancouver Coastal Health reported only four stillbirths between April and August 2021, according to Global News. Trials, studies and safety data have shown that COVID-19 vaccines are safe during pregnancy. The COVID-19 virus itself, rather than vaccines to protect against it, poses a risk to pregnant women. Pregnant women have a higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19, and ""a COVID-19 diagnosis documented during the delivery hospitalization was associated with an increased risk for stillbirth in the United States,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. According to CBC News and Global News, the rumors fueling these claims can be traced to video clips from an Nov. 11 anti-vaccination rally. The video clips feature two doctors, Daniel Nagase and Mel Bruchet, who are also named in the viral article as having ""started an official investigation"" into the supposed stillbirths. Nagase says in the video that Bruchet said a number of doulas told him there had been 13 stillbirths in a 24-hour period at Lions Gate Hospital in North Vancouver.

Johnson falsely says unvaccinated people around the world are being put into 'internment camps'
","In a Dec. 8, 2021 appearance on Janesville radio station WCLO, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson ran through his familiar talking points when it comes to the COVID-19 vaccine, including that adverse effects of the vaccine are being reported to the nation’s tracking system, that vaccinated people can still spread the virus, and reiterating that he has chosen not to be vaccinated.  Then he added this jaw-dropper:  ""I’m going to actually utilize my own freedom, my own health autonomy, and I’m going to choose not to get the vaccine, and now we are demonizing those people. Around the world, they’re putting them basically into internment camps,"" Johnson said. ""What is going on?"" The unvaccinated being sent to internment camps? Let’s check that out.  When asked for clarification on his remark, Johnson’s office told a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter he was referring to a COVID-19 quarantine site in Australia that requires residents returning from international travel to stay 14 days and be tested for the virus to ensure they aren’t bringing it back into the country with them.  In making the comment, Johnson spoke generally about people who choose not to be vaccinated — not travelers. So listeners would be left to think anyone who does not get vaccinated might be rounded up. In addition, Johnson claimed this is happening ""around the world,"" yet only provided a single example. Even setting those points aside, the claim is awry at best. Here is some background on the facility his staff said he was referring to: Located at a former mining camp in Howard Springs in the Northern Territory, it’s one of several such sites across Australia for Australians returning home from abroad. (The country remains closed to almost all travel by others.)  Australia has utilized such supervised mandatory quarantines to keep coronavirus cases low. According to the New York Times, Australia has seen an average of about six cases per 100,000 residents in the past week, compared with the United States’ 36 cases per 100,000 residents.  People at the quarantine site are required to test for the virus three times during their stay. They are given three meals a day, as well as drinking water, tea and coffee, free television and air conditioning, according to the Northern Territory’s information page. After 14 days on site, they are allowed to return home.  That would set the facility a far cry apart from what most people recognize as internment camps.  One general definition of an internment camp, as reported by Dictionary.com, is a guarded compound for the mass detainment of civilian citizens, especially those with ties to an enemy during wartime, without hearings or trials.  Americans may be most familiar with the case of the World War II-era detainment of Japanese Americans. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government grew suspicious of people of Japanese descent and began rounding them up for the camps, some on as little as two days’ notice.  Most who were sent to the camps lived there for close to three years. The camps were enclosed by barbed-wire fences and patrolled by armed guards who were under instruction to shoot anyone who attempted to leave, Britannica reports.  (It’s worth noting that three people who broke out of the Howard Springs site in late November were arrested — that is, taken into custody, not shot.)  David Inoue, executive director of the Japanese American Citizens League, the nation’s oldest and largest Asian American civil rights organization, said equating medical quarantine with incarceration is ""just ridiculous.""  While Japanese Americans were sent to internment camps because of their ethnicity and for an undetermined amount of time, Inoue said, the Australian policy involves people who are choosing to travel and who are aware of the scope of the quarantine requirements involved.  Those sent to the World War II-era camps could only bring one suitcase, Inoue said, and in some cases were shipped to colder regions without winter coats, arriving at barracks that were not properly insulated against the elements.  Any requirement for unvaccinated travelers to quarantine would be a consequence of their choice to remain unvaccinated, he said, not a consequence of something they cannot change, like their ancestry.  In response to a request for more details about the remark from Politifact Wisconsin, Johnson’s office issued a wide-ranging statement that – among other things – noted that countries like Australia, Austria and Germany have arrested citizens for not wearing masks outside, in violation of requirements. But the statement did nothing to support his claim that unvaccinated people were being sent to internment camps.  Our ruling  Johnson claimed that ""around the world,"" people who refused to get vaccinated were being placed ""basically into internment camps.""  Such camps throughout history have been used to corral those whom nations deem political prisoners or enemies, forcing people to live there for years. In comparison, the quarantine facility Johnson cited is for Australian residents returning home from abroad who stay there for two weeks, then get to go home.  In addition, Johnson spoke generally of those who are not vaccinated being sent to camps, but the example he cited was a facility for travelers. And while he said the practice was occurring ""around the world,"" he was only able to provide one such example.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire.  UPDATE Dec. 14, 2021 at 9:02 a.m.: A prior version of this article incorrectly stated that quarantined Australians were tested three times a day at the site. They are tested three times during their two-week stay.",/factchecks/2021/dec/13/ron-johnson/johnson-falsely-says-unvaccinated-people-around-wo/

Fact-checking how much governments in US, other nations spend on early childcare
","Economist and former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich decried to his 1.4 million Twitter followers how relatively little the United States spends on early childhood care. ""Norway spends about $30,000 per child on early childhood care. Finland spends $23,000. Germany, $18,000. The U.S. spends $500 per child. In other words, 1/60th of what Norway spends on its toddlers. How do we expect to build a better future if we refuse to invest in our kids?"" his Nov. 24 tweet read. A reader asked us to check if Reich is right. Reich, who served in the Clinton administration and is now at the University of California, Berkeley, cites a solid source on government spending figures, though there are other measures that show a smaller discrepancy. The tweet was part of an opinion column Reich wrote in which he argued that America has ""chosen to dramatically reduce poverty among the nation’s elderly but not among our children.""  A spokeswoman confirmed that Reich used rounded numbers based on a table included with an Oct. 6 New York Times article.  Those figures show annual public spending per child on early childhood care, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and Elizabeth Davis and Aaron Sojourner for the Hamilton Project: Norway: $29,726 Finland: $23,353 Germany: $18,656 United States: $500 The first three figures appear in the OECD’s report ""Education at a Glance 2021."" The spending figures are for early childhood education programs targeting children under 3 years that have an educational component of at least the equivalent of 2 hours per day and 100 days a year.  The report did not include a figure for the U.S. for children under age 3, but the Hamilton Project report, also cited as a source in the Times article, does, said one of the authors of the Hamilton Project report, University of Minnesota economist Aaron Sojourner. The figure for the U.S. is $500 per child. (The figure is $1,500 when preschoolers are included — children up to age 4.) Joya Misra, professor of sociology and public policy and director of the Institute for Social Science Research at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, pointed to different figures from the OECD that show a smaller disparity between the U.S. and the other countries. They show yearly public social spending on childcare for three age spans — 0 to 2 years, the ""pre primary"" 3 to 5 age group, and the combined 0 to 5 — divided by the population of each group. In round numbers, the total figures Misra pointed to were: Norway: $12,000 Finland: $8,000 Germany: $7,000 United States: $3,000 Some economists emphasized that the figures show only what governments spend on child care, not how much in total is spent on child care. ""Americans have chosen mostly to pay for child care directly, while other countries have chosen to pay for child care indirectly via taxation,"" said Antony Davies, a Duquesne University professor and fellow at the conservative Foundation for Economic Education. Jeffrey Miron, a Harvard University lecturer and director of economics studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said government spending can’t be considered in a vacuum. ""What matters to children is how much is spent on them, adding government and private expenditure,"" he said. ""If government provides a lot, private spending will cut back."" Reich said: ""Norway spends about $30,000 per child on early childhood care, Finland spends $23,000, Germany $18,000"" and the U.S. $500. He accurately cited figures from a solid source, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, but a different set of figures from the same organization shows a smaller discrepancy.

There’s no basis to claim thousands have died from COVID-19 vaccines
","Throughout 2021, misinformation based on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System has cycled persistently throughout social media. A new claim has popped up via Instagram: that thousands of COVID-19 vaccine deaths reported in VAERS are an undercount of an actual number of deaths. The Dec. 6 Instagram post shared a screenshot, showing a number of deaths it attributed to  vaccines: 1,621 deaths from Johnson & Johnson, 4,799 deaths from Moderna, 13,039 deaths from Pfizer and 73 from unknown vaccines. Those numbers were from the United States only, the Instagram user wrote in the caption. ""Only 1% of deaths are reported according to Harvard study,"" the user wrote.  We reached out to the Instagram user for more information but did not receive a response. We searched for the Harvard study that they referenced, but were not able to find one which stated 1% of deaths are reported. We did note in a separate fact-check that a well-known anti-vaccine advocate made a similar claim and cited a study that evaluated an automated system other than VAERS that tracked a patient’s health changes following a vaccination. But the study  did not explain how it calculated 1%. The Department of Health and Human Services has said on its website that the degree of underreporting in VAERS varies widely depending on the symptom being reported. Deaths and other adverse events following a vaccine have counted for many reports in the VAERS system — for more than 30 years, it’s been available as a public database that anyone can use to report an adverse health event that occurred after a vaccine. It helps government agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration detect whether a vaccine has a serious health side effect. There are thousands of reports entered into the VAERS system constantly.  But federal officials, health experts and organizations have warned repeatedly that correlation does not imply causation — just because an adverse event is reported as having occurred does not mean that a vaccine was the cause.  In addition, officials warn the public that VAERS cannot be used on its own to verify if a vaccine has caused an event. Its reports ""often lack details and sometimes can have information that contains errors,"" warned the agencies that run the system. VAERS accepts reports before verifying them — so it doesn’t provide enough concrete evidence. However, it has become used as a source for false claims that spread quickly across social media and other platforms. We’ve fact checked many of them.  This Instagram post said these numbers of deaths were only in the U.S.  Right now, the CDC reports that 200.4 million people have been fully vaccinated within the United States. The agency also reports that between Dec. 14, 2020, and Nov. 29, 2021, VAERS received 10,128 reports of deaths among people who were vaccinated — that figure would represent 0.0022% of vaccinated people. ""FDA requires health care providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem,"" the FDA reiterates. It isn’t clear where the numbers in the Instagram post came from. When we ran our own search in the VAERS database by using the CDC WONDER search tool to verify, we found a total of 8,843 reports had been made through Nov. 26, 2021 — 1,021 regarding Johnson & Johnson, 3,745 for Moderna, and 4,077 for the Pfizer BioNTech. Altogether, this is fewer than half what the post claims. Reports in VAERS are updated every week, and ""include reports processed through the preceding Friday"" according to database information. And again, no matter what the number of reports are in the VAERS system, those reports have yet to be verified. To say that a certain number of deaths have been caused by the COVID-19 vaccines is to make assumptions from inconclusive evidence. VAERS can detect true adverse events when used correctly. The government in April confirmed a handful of reports made to VAERS about women who experienced rare blood clotting following vaccination. In response, the FDA added a warning to the label and resumed administration of the vaccine. The incidents accounted for a tiny fraction of over 6.8 million Johnson & Johnson shots given at that point. The CDC said in an email to PolitiFact that it hasn’t detected any unusual or unexpected patterns for deaths after immunization, but did confirm six deaths following the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which resulted from a rare but serious adverse reaction of thrombocytopenia syndrome, or blood clotting.    An Instagram post claims that there have been 1,621 deaths from the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, 4,799 from Moderna, 13,039 from Pfizer and 73 from unknown vaccines, and claims that this is an undercount because only 1% of people reported deaths.   Available data in VAERS does not confirm these figures. What’s more, VAERS can’t be used on its own to verify if a vaccine has caused an event. The government agencies that run the system warn that it accepts reports before verifying them, and reports can usually contain information that may have errors or lacks details.  We rate this claim False.  PolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.",/factchecks/2021/dec/10/instagram-posts/theres-no-basis-claim-thousands-have-died-covid-19/

German chemist was not killed by ‘government operatives’ after revealing ‘secret’ about vaccine
","A grim rumor is circulating online among the followers of Andreas Noack, a German chemist  who has garnered tens of thousands of followers on YouTube and Telegram while spreading conspiracy theories about the pandemic. The rumor falsely says that Noack was assassinated after he purportedly revealed that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine contains a potentially dangerous material called graphene. ""Andreas (Noack) assassinated just hours after publishing the secret of the (vaccine) by government operatives just like many others before him,"" said a recent Facebook post shared in the public group Our World Is Changing. Another post in the same group claimed that the German chemist had been killed for ""exposing the truth about the graphene hydroxide."" Yet another post said that Noack had been ""murdered by the police."" These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact and other fact-checking websites have already reported that the Pfizer vaccine does not contain any form of graphene. And Noack’s partner said he died of a heart attack. The false claims about an assassination have been tough to dislodge, because they allude to real events: German special forces did once raid Noack’s apartment. And he did die unexpectedly. But those events occurred a year apart, in different countries. Before the pandemic, Noack focused his YouTube channel on topics related to alternative medicine and nutrition supplements. But over the past two years, he transitioned to allegations about COVID-19, including that it is part of a plot to destroy humanity. In November 2020, he gained visibility after security officials raided his apartment in Germany. The operation happened during one of Noack’s livestreams and was broadcast to his followers, who later claimed he was being targeted for violating German lockdown rules or for supporting anti-lockdown protests. German police told PolitiFact that the raid near Nuremberg was not aimed at Noack or related to the pandemic, and that it was carried out as part of a larger operation initiated by prosecutors in Berlin. Lead Stories reported at the time that the security officers had a warrant for Noack’s entire building and that someone in Noack’s apartment tried to resist their entry. According to Lead Stories, Noack later contributed to rumors about the event, describing it as psychological warfare meant to intimidate him. Noack later moved to Austria and continued sharing COVID-19 misinformation online.  A year after the raid, in November 2021, he published a video on his largest Telegram channel alleging that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine contains graphene. He based that false claim on a flawed paper written by a discredited researcher in Spain. The post got almost 380,000 views. Days later, Noack’s partner published a video on his Telegram channel saying in German that he had been ""heavily attacked,"" according to a translation rendered by Lead Stories. She claimed that the attack had been ""sneaky and unexpected"" and that he later died. Within a day, Noack’s video about the Pfizer vaccine was posted on BitChute — a video platform that researchers say hosts large amounts of hate speech and misinformation — with the title, ""MURDER! JUST HOURS AFTER PUBLISHING THE RESEARCH ON THE VAX, DR NOACK IS DEAD."" The description alleged that the ""forces that be"" decided that he ""hit the mark so hard with uncovering their plans, that they decided to take him out."" The video got more than 340,000 views. A day later, Noack’s partner published a second video on Telegram clarifying that Noack had died from a heart attack. She explained that he had collapsed at home and was taken to a hospital in Wolfsberg, in southern Austria. Austrian police told a regional newspaper that Noack died of natural causes. The website of a funeral home in Wolfsberg said he was 57.  But the rumors persisted. Noack’s followers focused on the reference to an ""attack"" and ignored the subsequent clarification. They also confused details of the November 2020 raid and Noack’s November 2021 death to falsely claim that Noack was assassinated by security officers, even though the two events happened in different years and countries. We tried to contact Noack’s partner on Telegram but did not receive a response. Posts in several languages on social media are now falsely claiming that Noack, a ""doctor,"" ""scientist,"" or ""whistleblower,"" was ""arrested,"" ""beaten,"" or ""murdered"" by the ""German police,"" ""government operatives,"" or the ""German government,"" after publicizing his ""discovery"" about Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. CrowdTangle data shows that interactions with content related to Noack on Facebook have now surpassed the previous peak registered when his apartment was raided.  On Nov. 30, someone shared the BitChute video about his ""murder"" on his official Telegram channel. The post has now been seen more than 100,000 times.  A Facebook post claimed that government agents murdered German chemist Andreas Noack after he revealed that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine contains graphene. Pfizer’s vaccine doesn’t contain graphene. Noack’s partner said that he died from a heart attack, and Austrian police said that he died from natural causes. And the claim alludes to a raid by government agents, but that raid occurred a year before Noack died.

No, the COVID-19 vaccine is not the deadliest vaccine ever made
","COVID-19 ushered in the biggest vaccination campaign in history. And a relentless disinformation campaign about vaccines quickly followed.  One of the latest controversial statements about the vaccines came from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, and one of the biggest sources of anti-vaccine rhetoric today, as he spoke to Louisiana lawmakers.  Kennedy was given the floor for about 20 minutes during a Dec. 6 Louisiana House oversight meeting on a proposal that would require students to get vaccinated against COVID-19 before entering school. The meeting ended several hours later with the state House Committee on Health & Welfare voting 13-2 to oppose requiring vaccination. Kennedy used his time to make a series of problematic and false statements about the COVID-19 vaccines and, at one point, argued that the shots’ record ""confirms that this is the deadliest vaccine ever made."" Pointing to a pie graph that compiled deaths reported in the federal government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System over the last 30 years, Kennedy claimed that there are ""more people who have died in eight months from this vaccine than from 72 vaccines over the last 30 years."" But there are several errors with Kennedy’s claim. We address them here, one by one.  The biggest issue is the low-quality data that Kennedy relies on to make his point.  VAERS, which is run by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, was established in the late 1980s to help health agencies and researchers collect and analyze data on vaccine after-effects and to detect patterns that may warrant a closer look. But the database is an open-access system and unlike other government data sources that are screened before being made available to the public. VAERS is designed so that anyone — parents, patients and health care professionals — can freely report any health effects that occur after a vaccination, according to the CDC, whether or not those effects are believed to be caused by a vaccine.  The reports aren’t verified before they’re entered and have included car accidents and incidents of self injury. Still, anyone with a computer can search the data, download it, and interpret the numbers as they wish — making VAERS fertile ground for vaccine misinformation. The VAERS search engine has a prominent disclaimer that says: ""The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines."" VAERS reports alone ""cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness,"" it says. People using the database are required to click on a form saying that they understand these limitations. Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said VAERS is misnamed because it leads people to believe that if something was reported, it’s automatically an adverse effect of the vaccine. ""At its best, VAERS is a hypothesis-generating mechanism. It really should be titled ‘suspected adverse event,’"" Offit said. ""There is no screening. You could report that your child got the vaccine and turned into the Incredible Hulk."" More than 459 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through Nov. 29, 2021, according to the CDC. During this time, VAERS received 10,128 reports of death (0.0022%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine, agency spokesperson Martha Sharan told PolitiFact in an email. That includes people who died of any cause. ""Reports of adverse events, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a COVID-19 vaccine caused a health problem,"" Sharan added. ""Statements that imply that reports of deaths to VAERS following vaccination equate to deaths caused by vaccination are scientifically inaccurate, misleading and irresponsible."" Health officials have data on billions of individuals who have received multiple doses of the COVID-19 vaccines, said Dr. Rebecca Weintraub, an assistant professor in the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School.  ""So yes, we are confident that we have a robust database that these vaccines are as safe and effective as other vaccines,"" Weintraub said. ""It prevents death, it prevents severe disease and it decreases transmission. And we know that for those who are vaccinated who get breakthrough cases, they clear the virus faster."" On average, 2,800 people die each day in the U.S., and health officials say that there will always be people who got a vaccine who die afterward from unrelated causes. This is especially true for a vaccine that over 70% of the country’s population has received. ""Hank Aaron is one example,"" Offit said. ""He died of a stroke because he was in his mid-80s, not because of a vaccine."" The CDC said in an email to PolitiFact that it hasn’t detected any unusual or unexpected patterns for deaths following immunization that would indicate that the COVID-19 vaccines are causing or contributing to deaths, outside of six confirmed deaths following the Johnson & Johnson vaccine due to complications from a rare and serious adverse reaction called thrombocytopenia syndrome. The reaction prompted officials to pause injections of the vaccine for about 10 days. In an email, Kennedy’s spokesperson, Rita Shreffler, cited the same VAERS numbers and said that a 2010 study found that, as opposed to overcounting, VAERS vastly undercounts vaccine injuries — fewer than 1%.  But that study evaluated an automated system that tracked a patient’s health changes following a vaccination, rather than the voluntary reporting system that Kennedy drew his numbers from. It also didn’t explain how it calculated the percentage.  In VAERS, the degree of underreporting varies widely depending on the symptom being reported, the Department of Health and Human Services said on its website. ""As an example, a great many of the millions of vaccinations administered each year by injection cause soreness, but relatively few of these episodes lead to a VAERS report,"" HHS says. ""Physicians and patients understand that minor side effects of vaccinations often include this kind of discomfort, as well as low fevers. On the other hand, more serious and unexpected medical events are probably more likely to be reported than minor ones, especially when they occur soon after vaccination, even if they may be coincidental and related to other causes."" René Najera, an epidemiologist and editor of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia’s History of Vaccines website, said that Kennedy’s statement is typical of anti-vaccine activists who make inflammatory comments without credible evidence.  Najera said that it’s difficult to compare the COVID-19 vaccines with vaccines from decades ago because the technology and communication are better. If anything, he said, a very small signal of an adverse reaction would be identified and detected more quickly now than back then. ""First, we had the smallpox vaccine in the early 1800s,"" Najera said. ""It was given to millions around the world, but we just don't know how many people may have died from it — there was no such thing as a clean needle back then. But we do know that it prevented smallpox, and the epidemic started to die down afterward."" The closest thing to a ""deadly"" vaccine was the result of a lab accident, Najera said, not the therapeutic itself. When the polio vaccine was licensed in the 1950s, independent labs started to create it. One California lab, Cutter Laboratories, didn’t deactivate the virus used in the vaccine as it should have, and several thousand children were exposed to the live polio virus, with several dozen dying as a result.  When the flu vaccine rolled out in the mid-to-late 1970s, it was found that on very rare occasions, people developed Guillain-Barré syndrome after being vaccinated. Guillain-Barré is a disorder in which the immune system attacks the nerves, and it can also result from the flu itself. In the late 1990s, the live virus RotaShield vaccine was found to be a rare cause of intussusception, a type of bowel blockage caused when the intestine folds into itself like a telescope. There was one death, and the vaccine was pulled from the market.  ""This was caught by the same surveillance systems we have now, and while it was very treatable it was still taken off the market,"" Najera said. Offit said vaccines have in rare cases been associated with adverse events, including the diseases they’re meant to prevent, but that Kennedy’s claim is ""just not true."" ""The COVID-19 shots are very typical of vaccines, which have associated adverse events,"" he said. ""The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are a rare cause of myocarditis. The J&J vaccine is a very rare cause of one in 500,000 for blood clots. ""The flu vaccine can rarely cause Guillain-Barré syndrome. The polio vaccine that we used from the early ’60s to 2000s was a rare cause of polio. The yellow fever vaccine can cause yellow fever for about one per million recipients."" Meanwhile, few measures in public health can compare with the impact of vaccines, which medical officials and analysts say have saved more lives than any other single medical advance. Vaccinations have reduced disease, disability, and death from a variety of infectious diseases by protecting those vaccinated and by reducing the spread of disease. One 2017 report highlighted the impact in the U.S. of immunization against nine diseases, including smallpox, measles and polio. All were shown to have been reduced by 90% or more. Kennedy claimed that the COVID-19 vaccine is the deadliest vaccine ever made according to deaths reported in VAERS. VAERS is an unreliable source, and the agencies that run it say its reports cannot be used on their own to establish whether a vaccine caused any adverse event.  Health officials and experts said that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and comparable to others, and that they would have been discontinued if they had caused many deaths.

Heart health warnings about cold weather are real, and predate the pandemic
","For years, scientists have cautioned people about the health effects of winter weather, including blood clots and heart problems. To skeptics of vaccines, those conditions sound familiar.

Joni Ernst says 'a strong majority of Americans' back the Keystone XL pipeline
","See editor's note below During the Republican response to President Barack Obama’s 2015 State of the Union address, newly elected Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa urged bipartisan cooperation to pass a longstanding agenda item for Republicans and some Democrats -- the Keystone XL pipeline. The project has been in the works since 2008, and its current version involves a 875-mile pipeline that would run from Morgan, Mont., to Steele City, Neb. Building this link would allow 830,000 barrels of oil per day to move from the tar sands fields in Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Opponents of the pipeline say it will increase greenhouse gas emissions and increase the risk of water pollution from spills. Supporters speak of improved energy security and jobs, and blame the Obama administration for stalling what they consider critical infrastructure supported by many business leaders and labor unions. Here’s what Ernst said during her State of the Union response on Jan. 20, 2015. ""The new Republican majority you elected started by reforming Congress to make it function again. And now, we’re working hard to pass the kind of serious job-creation ideas you deserve. One you’ve probably heard about is the Keystone jobs bill.  ""President Obama has been delaying this bipartisan infrastructure project for years, even though many members of his party, unions, and a strong majority of Americans support it. The President’s own State Department has said Keystone’s construction could support thousands of jobs and pump billions into our economy, and do it with minimal environmental impact."" We wondered whether Ernst was correct when she said that ""a strong majority of Americans support"" the pipeline. So we looked at the polling data. At the survey curation site pollingreport.com, we found five polls taken since May 2014 that asked questions that shed light on Ernst’s claim. We’ll start with the four polls that asked the question in its most basic form -- whether the respondent favors or opposes construction of the pipeline: • CBS News, Jan. 9-12, 2015. ""Do you favor or oppose building the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada through the United States to refineries in Texas?"" Favor: 60 percent. Oppose: 28 percent. Unsure or no answer: 12 percent. (Margin of error ± 3 percent.) • USA Today/Princeton Survey Research Associates International, Nov. 13-16, 2014. ""Should Congress and President Obama approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada's oil sands region through the Midwest to refineries in Texas, or not?"" Yes: 60 percent. No: 25 percent. Unsure: 14 percent. (Margin of error ± 3.6 percent.) • Pew Research Center, Nov. 6-9, 2014. ""Do you favor or oppose building the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada's oil sands region through the Midwest to refineries in Texas?"" Favor: 59 percent. Oppose: 31 percent. Unsure/refused: 10 percent. (Margin of error ± 3.1 percent.) • CBS News, May 16-19, 2014. ""Do you favor or oppose building the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada through the United States to refineries in Texas?"" Favor: 56 percent. Oppose: 28 percent. Unsure/No answer: 17 percent. For these four polls, support for the pipeline held steady in a very narrow band, from 56 percent to 60 percent. So Ernst has a strong case to make. The only caveat stems from the fifth poll, which asked the question in a somewhat different way. An ABC News/Washington Post poll taken between Jan. 12 and Jan. 15, 2015, phrased the question this way: ""Obama has said he won't decide whether to approve a new oil pipeline from Canada to Texas until a review has determined whether it is in the national interest. The Republicans in Congress are working on a law to authorize the pipeline without Obama's approval. Which side do you support? Should the pipeline be authorized now, or should the review be completed before deciding?"" Asked the question this way, respondents were less sanguine about the approach being taken by the Republican Congress of which Ernst is now part: 34 percent said the pipeline should be authorized without Obama’s approval, while 61 percent said that the review should be completed first. (Another 2 percent said they opposed the pipeline outright, but that answer was only tallied when volunteered, not because it was given as an option.) In other words, the polls show strong and consistent public support for building the pipeline, but one poll suggests it's only after completing full reviews of its merits. Our ruling Ernst said that ""a strong majority of Americans support"" the Keystone XL pipeline. She’s right that between 56 percent and 60 percent of the public has consistently supported the project when asked outright whether it should be built. However, one poll found public concern about building it before reviews are complete -- a stance more in tune with Obama than with Republican leaders. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. EDITOR’S NOTE, Jan. 21, 2015: After this article appeared, a reader pointed out another poll that had addressed public support for the Keystone XL pipeline that had been released the same day we published the story. A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll taken in January 2015 asked respondents whether they favored or opposed building the pipeline, or whether they did ""not know enough about this topic to have an opinion."" The inclusion of that last phrase increased the ""don’t know"" response beyond that found in most other polls, to 37 percent. Of those who did have an opinion, 41 percent favored building Keystone XL and 20 percent opposed it. Because that's generally in line with what we found in the other polls, our original rating of Mostly True stands.",/factchecks/2015/jan/21/joni-ernst/joni-ernst-says-strong-majority-americans-back-key/

Barack Obama claims deficit has decreased by two-thirds since taking office
","When President Barack Obama reflects on 2014, he brings up a litany of highlights that include drawing down the Afghanistan war and Americans signing up for health insurance thanks to his health care law. Oh, and slicing up the deficit. Obama is super-pumped about that. He made a point to brag about the deficit's drop in his 2015 State of the Union address. ""At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits,"" Obama said. ""Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years."" Is he right about the deficit dropping by two-thirds? What the White House says As a reminder, don’t get the deficit twisted with the debt. They are only related, not the same. The country’s annual deficit is the difference between what the government collects in revenues and spends in one year. The national debt, which exceeds $18 trillion, is the net of annual deficits minus any annual surpluses. To back up his claim, Obama is comparing his first budget year in office -- 2009 -- to 2014. The White House is breaking down the deficit as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, and not actual dollars. Economists told us this is a valid way of analyzing the deficit, because it factors in the economy’s change over time. The White House sent us this chart, which relies on data from the White House Office of Management and Budget.  In fiscal year 2009, which started almost four months before Obama's presidency began and ended eight months into it, the deficit was 9.8 percent of GDP. The 2014 shortfall is 2.8 percent of GDP -- a decrease of 71 percent. So that's where the claim comes from. The situation largely tracks if you use real dollars. Using the same comparison with Congressional Budget Office figures, the deficit fell from $1.4 trillion in the 2009 fiscal year to $486 billion in the 2014 fiscal year -- a drop of about 66 percent. Why the drop might not be so exciting Experts told us that while Obama's math may be correct, it's missing some important caveats.  First, it's important to note that the deficit swelled in 2009 (hence the steady drop). In 2008, the deficit was $458 billion, or 3.1 percent of GDP. Those deficits are smaller than the ones the country is facing today. The 2009 fiscal year represented a huge jump in the deficit, partly because of the massive stimulus program to jumpstart the cratering economy. ""This is not to say that that large deficit was his fault, but if one used the 2008 deficit as a frame of reference, the comparison would be quite different,"" said Alan Auerbach, University of California Berkeley professor of economics and law. Also, some economists we consulted pointed out that the 2009 fiscal year was Obama’s first year in office, and so not necessarily a good starting point since he had little control over the spending in that year. And there's another issue. Princeton University economics professor Harvey Rosen said the more important question is if Obama has put the government on a path that will keep deficits stable. ""And the answer is no,"" Rosen said, because entitlement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, have not had substantial reform. The long-term forecast for the deficit illustrates this point. Absent substantial reform, the Congressional Budget Office expects a few more years of short-term deficit decreases followed by bigger shortfalls in 10 and 20 years. Federal spending is projected to increase through 2039, so much so that by then the federal debt held by the public will reach a point only seen after World War II. The deficit would be equal to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2029 and 6.5 percent of GDP by 2039, a higher deficit than any year between 1947 and 2008. This chart from the Congressional Budget Office shows how the deficit is not expected to continue its downward trend in recent years.  A final word on Obama’s point from the experts. The deficit has come down in recent years because of the strengthening economy, which drives tax revenues up, and the draw-down of various economic stimulus programs that were implemented to weather the financial crisis. Additionally, the expiration of 2 percent payroll tax cuts and increases in tax rates for high-income earners played a role, albeit a smaller one. ""It’s not clear one would want to view the evolution as relating to fiscal responsibility rather than an improving economy,"" Auerbach said. Our ruling Obama said since taking office the country has seen ""our deficits cut by two-thirds."" His claim is accurate if you use 2009, his first year in office with an historically high deficit, as a starting point. The claim ignores a stark reality about the deficits, however. The country’s spending is not expected to continue its downward route, according to federal forecasters, for factors that include increased interest payments on the debt and the lack of substantial policy changes for the country’s biggest programs, like Social Security and Medicare. The deficits have largely come down as a result of the improved economy for which Obama cannot assume full credit. We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-deficit-has-decreased-two-thir/

One is new home sales, the measure of newly constructed houses as measured by the Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Commerce. The other is existing home sales, which is compiled by the National Association of Realtors. The two are tracked by separate entities because new home sales involve measuring other economic indicators, as well, like construction jobs and materials. The numbers the White House provided were measured like this: They took the average of the last six months of available data (ending November 2014, in this case) and compared it to the lowest point in sales for both kinds of sales. Those low points were in different months for each type of sale (February 2011 for new home sales and July 2010 for existing home sales). The census data an Obama spokesperson provided matched what we found independently, but existing home sales data are a little trickier. The National Association of Realtors splits that into two groups, single-family homes and condos or co-ops. The White House supplied single-family home numbers only, but NAR spokesperson Adam DeSanctis said the best measure is to combine both, because that gives a better overall picture, so we looked at it that way, too. Because we don’t want to make your head spin from all these digits, we’ll chart it out for you: Sale type June-November 2014 average Low point during recession Percent change New home sales 432,000 270,000
(February 2011) + 60 percent Existing home sales (single-family homes only) 4.49 million 3.06 million (July 2010) + 47 percent Existing home sales (single-family homes + condos and co-ops) 5.096 million 3.45 million (July 2010) + 48 percent For reference, this is approaching a return to more normal transaction numbers, because sales were grossly inflated during the housing bubble. Sales of new homes reached a peak of almost 1.4 million in July 2005, while existing home sales topped out at 7.26 million in September 2005, before the bubble finally burst around 2008. Obama said ""nearly 50 percent,"" so he could be talking about simply existing home sales, but the White House supplied us with both. We can’t simply average out the two different percentages because they cover different time periods, but both have recovered considerably. Beyond an upswing in sales, reports from real estate data firms RealtyTrac and Core Logic show foreclosure filings (things like default notices, bank repossessions and scheduled auctions) in 2014 were down more than 60 percent from their 2010 high of 2.87 million, back to pre-recession levels. That’s not to say the housing market is necessarily robust, either. Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies said in its latest State of the Nation’s Housing report that new single-family housing starts are still depressed, and existing home inventories are constrained. Households that pay an excessive portion of their incomes to live in their property remain near historical highs, as well. In any case, the approximation of the rebound in the national market is accurate, although one expert told us it still doesn’t paint the clearest picture of the economic recovery. ""While encouraging, national numbers mask the uneven nature of the housing recovery,"" said Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University. ""In many towns and neighborhoods the legacy of the crisis is strong, and these areas continue to struggle with weak demand, underwater homeowners and high levels of vacancy and abandonment."" Debbie Goldstein, executive vice president at consumer protection group the Center for Responsible Lending, credits the Obama administration for pushing several policy positions that helped prospective homebuyers secure loans, and helped delinquent homeowners refinance. She said the Home Affordable Refinance Program that started in 2009 saved many homeowners from defaulting on their mortgages. She also said more recent underwriting rules will help lenders and buyers avoid some problems that led to the housing crisis. But she also said Washington could have done more, such as reducing principal for underwater homeowners, helping more first-time homebuyers get into the market and improve lending access to minorities. Plus, Congress could always roll back the underwriting rules and change everything. Our ruling Obama said, ""Today, home sales are up nearly 50 percent from where they were in the worst of the crisis."" That number matches census data for new home sales, although the White House said they also based the claim on existing home sales, which have increased by about 60 percent over the lowest point during the recession. The national numbers are largely accurate, although Obama’s statement doesn’t provide details about pockets of the market still experiencing trouble, nor does it address whether the recovery would have happened regardless of his policies -- although experts say those policies were a factor in the recovery. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/home-sales-are-nearly-50-percent-worst-housing-cri/

Obama claims U.S. has doubled production of 'clean energy'
","America’s recovery from the Great Recession is slow but steady, President Barack Obama said in a recent speech, and the country is headed in the right direction, thanks in part to his energy initiatives. He told students at Pellissippi State Community College in Knoxville, Tenn., on Jan. 9, 2015, the United States is now the world’s No. 1 producer in oil and gas -- a statement we’ve researched in the past and rated True -- and touted a move to more renewable resources. ""We’ve doubled the production of clean energy,"" Obama told the crowd. There was no time frame given or any indication of what he considered clean energy, but PolitiFact wondered whether that was true. And if it was, could he take credit for it? Generating interest The White House specified Obama was referring to solar, wind and geothermal (harnessing power from heat generated under the Earth’s crust), but omitted any specific time frame. We can go ahead and assume they mean since the beginning of Obama’s first term, but the definition of renewables needs some explaining.   The U.S. Energy Information Administration considers renewable energy as coming from any source that is ""naturally replenishing but flow-limited,"" meaning there are limits on how much energy can be derived from the source at once. This also includes biomass fuels, like burning wood and solid waste, and hydroelectric power. States often don’t classify hydroelectric as renewable for several reasons, including substantial infrastructure requirements and the disruption of water ecosystems. Many states also don’t count hydroelectric in order to pressure utilities to increase renewable energy resources beyond existing hydroelectric facilities. It’s important to note that promoting renewable energy was a major focus of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed by the Democrat-controlled Congress in February 2009 to help spur the economy in the wake of the recession. Obama signed the bill, which contained some $90 billion for energy-related investment, reimbursements for installations, a reauthorized loan guarantee program and tax credits. One of the goals was to double renewable energy generation by 2012. Since the administration mentioned those three energy sources as their definition of ""clean energy,"" they are the ones we asked the Energy Information Administration about. Spokesperson John Cogan provided this information for the existing net summer capacity of energy production types in megawatts: Year Wind Solar, Thermal and Photovoltaic Geothermal Total 2007 16,515 502 2,214 19,231 2008 24,651 536 2,229 27,416 2009 34,296 619 2,382 37,297 2010 39,135 866 2,405 42,406 2011 45,676 1,524 2,409 49,609 2012 59,075 3,170 2,592 65,377 Now, don’t go thinking we’re all suddenly living emission-free and the specter of global warming due to greenhouse gases is a thing of the past. The country still uses fossil fuels like coal, petroleum and natural gas for most of its electricity needs, about 68 percent as of June 2014 (the EIA says wind, solar and geothermal generated less than 5 percent in that time frame, up from about 1.5 percent in 2008). Still, that’s a marked decrease in fossil fuel use, which was around 85 percent in 2008. Also, we can’t completely ignore hydroelectric and biomass sources. Those sources are considered renewable even if they weren’t named by the White House, but their use has not doubled since 2008. Both have remained basically flat in that time period. So can Obama take credit for this spike in renewable energy resource use? Joseph Aldy, former special assistant to the president for energy and environment in 2009-10 and currently an assistant public policy professor at Harvard, says yes, arguing the combination of tax credits, grants and guaranteed loans for renewable energy projects helped boost providers through tight credit and labor markets. Current production far exceeds Energy Information Administration projections from 2009, he told PolitiFact. Susan Glickman, the Florida director of the pro-renewables Southern Alliance for Clean Energy said some expansion would have happened anyway, since costs have gone down, particularly for wind and solar. But not only did the Recovery Act spur growth for renewable energy, the residual effects have continued. The 2013 National Renewable Energy Laboratory report bears out these growth trends, which have been fueled by federal incentives, she said. Our ruling Obama said, ""we’ve doubled the production of clean energy."" The White House said he was referring to wind, solar and geothermal, which are three types of renewable resources promoted in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Energy Information Administration confirmed that capacity had basically doubled between 2009 and 2012, accomplishing Obama’s goals. Renewable resource advocates also agreed that the Recovery Act contributed to that growth. Obama didn’t mention, however, that so-called ""clean energy"" still accounts for a sliver of U.S. energy production, which overwhelmingly relies on fossil fuels. Nor does it include other kinds of renewable energy, such as biomass and hydroelectric, which have remained relatively flat. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jan/20/barack-obama/obama-claims-us-has-doubled-production-clean-energ/
"['New Hampshire', 'Campaign Finance', 'Lawrence  Lessig']","
Lawrence Lessig compares the number of fundraisers between Presidents Reagan and Obama
","Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig has recently been making a frigid, 150-mile walk through New Hampshire to promote campaign finance reform. Lessig, the founder of the crowdfunded Mayday PAC -- known as the super-PAC to end all super-PACs -- kicked off the 10-day march in the tiny Northern New Hampshire town of Dixville Notch, known for its midnight ballot box voting during the ""first in the nation"" primary. His walk will take him and dozens others to the state capitol in Concord by Jan. 21. In a visit to the Concord Monitor before starting the walk, Lessig offered a striking comparison showing how the role of money in politics has changed over the years. To Lessig, fundraising has become a primary focus for today’s politicians, at the expense of governing. ""If you ask how many times did Ronald Reagan attend a fundraiser when he ran for re-election in 1984, the answer is eight times. If you say how many times did Barack Obama attend a fundraiser in 2012, the answer is 228 times,"" Lessig told the Monitor. He continued, ""And you think, how does a man, as a person, run the nation when he's attending 228 fundraisers? And the answer is not very well. It's pretty terrible for your ability to do your job. It's pretty terrible for your ability to be responsive to the American people, because -- let me tell you -- the American people are not attending 228 fundraisers. Those people are different."" It’s no secret that truckloads of dollars are raised and spent in presidential elections, but PolitiFact New Hampshire wondered whether Lessig’s specific comparison between Reagan and Obama was accurate. Lessig isn’t the first to make the comparison between Reagan and Obama on fundraising; similar statistics have surfaced in various media reports. These comparisons track back to a distinction in campaign financing that we’ll recap here. The story begins in 1972, the year of President Richard Nixon’s re-election campaign. (Yes, the one that led to the Watergate scandal.) That year, the Nixon re-election campaign collected millions of dollars in illegal campaign contributions. After Nixon’s resignation, Congress passed (and Nixon’s successor as president, Gerald Ford, signed into law) changes to the Federal Election Campaign Act. Once enacted, presidential candidates were able to receive a partial federal match for money they raised for the primary, up to $5 million. And for the general election, candidates could secure full federal funding -- up to $20 million -- as long as they raised no private money for the general election and stuck to expenditure limits. That system prevailed for the better part of three decades. However, in recent presidential campaign cycles, the system began to break down due to a combination of court decisions and changes in how presidential campaigns prefer to operate. An arms-race style competition between the parties has left any candidate who accepts the restrictions tied to federal funding at a severe disadvantage, since candidates can easily raise more private money than the federal allotment, without the strings attached. Obama is one of those politicians. He was the first president since Nixon to be elected with only private money. And to give some perspective on the amount of money we’re talking about, more than $2 billion was raised and spent in the last presidential election between Obama and Mitt Romney. When we contacted Lessig to see where he was getting his data comparing Obama to Reagan, he pointed to a presentation by Fred Wertheimer, a lawyer and founder of Democracy 21, a group that advocates curbing the influence of big money in American politics. In his presentation -- made at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School in October, 2012 -- Wertheimer said the system for public financing of presidential elections, which emerged in the wake of the Watergate scandal, is broken. Reagan used the public financing system for his campaign in 1984 and did not have a primary opponent, eliminating his need to raise money during the primary and general election. Reagan ""ran for re-election without holding a single campaign fundraiser,"" reported Washington Post national political editor Dan Eggen in a 2012 article, ""Post-Watergate campaign finance limits undercut by changes."" ""If he attended fundraisers, they must have been for the party or for other GOP candidates,"" concurred Viveca Novak, the editorial and communications director at the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money raised by politicians running for federal offices. Lessig later pointed to an article in the Baltimore Sun by Brendan Doherty -- a political science professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and author of the book, The Rise of the President’s Permanent Campaign. Doherty counted 220 fundraisers for the Obama Victory Fund, compared to just three fundraisers ""headlined"" by Ronald Reagan during his third and fourth years in office, leading up to his re-election. Doherty doesn’t break down the fundraisers year by year, and instead uses a campaign cycle, which usually spans two calendar years. His numbers match those cited by USA Today, which reported on Aug. 12, 2012, that Obama had attended his 200th fundraiser since filing for re-election in the spring of 2011. Obama attended five fundraisers in one day in Chicago, including one at which guests paid $40,000 per ticket, according to the newspaper. Doherty counted the fundraisers by using the public papers of the presidents of the United States, presidential libraries and Lexis-Nexis searches of Associated Press articles. ""My numbers are a bit different from the trend you cite, but (the) shift from Reagan to Obama in terms of time spent fundraising has been dramatic,"" Doherty told the Monitor. All told, Reagan received about $40 million in public financing during his campaign -- while Obama raised more than $715 million in private funds. With the demise of the public financing system and looser rules on raising and spending money, said Novak of the Center for Responsive Politics, ""fundraising is unfortunately a bigger part of the process than ever before,"" Novak said. Our ruling Lessig said Reagan attended eight fundraisers in 1984, while Obama attended 228 in the 2012 cycle. We couldn’t replicate his exact numbers, but they jibe with reports by experts and the logic of how the public- and private-financing systems work. There’s certainly little doubt about Lessig’s larger point -- that there’s been a sea change in spending on presidential elections during the past 30 years.

Barack Obama says U.S. auto industry has 'created about 500,000 new jobs' in past 5 years
","During a recent visit to an automobile assembly plant in Wayne, Mich., President Barack Obama took a bit of a victory lap when he discussed the comeback of the American automobile industry. ""Over the past five years, this industry created about 500,000 new jobs,"" Obama said. ""Last year, American autoworkers churned out cars faster than any year since 2005. Ford has brought jobs back from Mexico, created nearly 24,000 new jobs across this country, including 1,800 new jobs right here in this plant. And after more than a century since Henry Ford introduced the moving assembly line, you’re reinventing it -- one production line for gas, electric, hybrid, plug-in vehicles. That’s the first in the world, right here in Wayne, Mich."" That’s a lot of statistics to chew over, but we decided to look at Obama’s first claim -- that ""over the past five years, (the automobile) industry created about 500,000 new jobs. We looked at this question back in 2012, when United Auto Workers president Bob King said at the Democratic National Convention that since June 2009, the auto industry ""has added a quarter of a million jobs."" We rated that claim True. So has the increase in auto-related jobs really doubled since two and a half years ago? Actually, it has. To determine job creation in the auto sector, we need to combine the figures for two separate categories of jobs. One is ""motor vehicles and parts manufacturing,"" and the other is ""motor vehicle and parts dealers."" Between December 2009 and December 2014, the number of jobs in the manufacturing category rose by 230,700 (from 653,300 to 884,000). Over the same period, the number of jobs in the dealer category rose by 272,200 (from 1,616,800 to 1,889,000). When you put those two categories together, the total increase in jobs over the past five years is 502,900 -- almost exactly what Obama said. It’s worth noting that this comeback hasn’t brought automotive-industry employment back to its pre-recession levels. The recent pre-recession peak for these two job categories -- in February 2005 -- was 3.03 million. So despite the gains over the past five years, employment in the automotive industry is still down 9 percent from where it was a decade ago. We’ll also note that PolitiFact’s policy is to consider not just whether a statement is statistically accurate, but also whether the politician or party in question seems to be claiming credit or assigning blame, and if so, whether that credit or blame is deserved. In this case, it’s unclear whether Obama is taking credit for the automotive-industry job growth, but even if he is, experts have told us that Obama’s leadership was crucial, along with help from some Republicans, in helping get the industry back on its feet. So we won’t be downgrading the accuracy of this comment on that basis. Our ruling Obama said that over the past five years, the American automobile industry has ""created about 500,000 new jobs."" During the period in question, the actual number of job gains in the car industry is strikingly close to what Obama said -- 502,900 -- and we don’t find any significant omissions in his claim.

Obama: more factories opening today than two decades ago
","President Barack Obama celebrated some signals that American manufacturing is strengthening while on a recent multi-state tour. ""We invested in clean energy, saved the auto industry, and today, factories are opening their doors at the fastest pace in almost two decades,"" he said in Clinton, Tenn. Jan. 9.   Manufacturing was already facing challenges in terms of jobs, output and factory closings when the recession hit in the late 2000s. So we wondered about their recovery and Obama’s claim that factories are opening up faster than they have in years. The White House told us that they were counting since 1997, about 17 years. The Bureau of Labor Statistics counts the number of factories in its ""Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages."" We used the agency’s online database to look at the change in the number of factories (manufacturing establishments) since then. At the peak -- early on, in 1998, there were 412,453 private manufacturing establishments. That dropped steadily each year, to a low point of 333,565 in 2013. That’s a 19 percent drop and a loss of nearly 80,000 establishments. But in the second quarter of 2014 -- the latest data available -- it’s up to 338,304. That’s growth of 1.5 percent from the trough, but far below the peak back in 1998. Any growth would constitute factories ""opening their doors at the fastest pace in almost two decades"" because -- except for a couple of short-lived blips -- this is the first time the number of factories has grown at all since the 1990s. Here’s a graph showing the overall trend, using the Bureau of Labor Statistics data:  ""Bottom line, the president's statement is accurate, but positive growth in 2014 would make it the first calendar year to add facilities since the president took office,"" said Taylor Garland, spokeswoman for nonprofit advocacy group Alliance for American Manufacturing. A January 2015 paper out of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation looks at recent trends in manufacturing, including the number of establishments -- using the same Bureau of Labor Statistics data. While the authors noted the modest growth, they said this particular data set has limited usefulness in terms of identifying future trends. The count can include factories that have had a change in their production situation -- like relocating or re-opening after a period of closure -- instead of just capturing the number of brand-new factories. A revival? The foundation’s report says American manufacturing peaked in the late 1970s. Losses in the industry through the 1990s led to more dramatic losses in the 2000s, coinciding with the rise of globalization and China’s economic prowess. And the recession accelerated the process. But Obama and others see the growing number of factories and other positive economic figures about the manufacturing industry as a flicker of hope for a manufacturing revival. In his recent speeches, Obama has also said, ""Manufacturing is actually growing faster than the rest of the economy."" Over the four quarters of most recently available data -- from mid 2013 to mid 2014 -- the United States’ overall GDP grew 2.7 percent. Manufacturing grew faster, at 4.6 percent. Some economists, however, are skeptical that the uptick signifies a larger trend. The report from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation says these positive indicators might just be cyclical. International investment bank Goldman Sachs came to a similar conclusion. ""Conditions for U.S. manufacturing are certainly better than they were a decade ago, as employment and output are both growing, albeit slowly,"" the report says. ""Despite this improvement, there is not yet evidence to support the notion of a U.S. manufacturing renaissance."" Our ruling Obama said, ""Factories are opening their doors at the fastest pace in almost two decades."" The latest figures line up with Obama’s claim. The number of factories steadily decreased from 1998 to 2013. In the first two quarters of 2014, things started to pick up, though they are still nowhere near the 1998 peak. We should note that economists are far from certain that this is a significant trend, or if it will continue. This is just one figure of many that could clue us into whether or not manufacturing is making a resurgence, but it’s not enough by itself to make any broad claims about a recovery.

Analyst on target on education spending
","Years of state austerity cuts have forced many of the state’s 180 local school districts to furlough or cut employees, increase class sizes and shorten their school years. But they’ve also contributed to a shift in the costs for K-12 education, Claire Suggs, an education policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, said Jan. 9. The state was picking up 56 percent of those costs in Fiscal Year 2002, the year before the austerity cuts began, and only 51 percent in Fiscal 2013, Suggs told reporters at the Georgia Partnership for Excellence in Education’s Media Symposium. ""We are relying much more on local and federal dollars,"" she said. We decided to fact-check Suggs’ statement, given Gov. Nathan Deal’s announcement last week that he expects a major overhaul of the state’s 30-year school funding formula, the Quality Basic Education (QBE) Act of 1985, to be completed and in place for the 2016-2017 school year. Education funding was one of the hot topics of last year’s governor’s race, largely because of those austerity cuts, which started in 2003 under Gov. Sonny Perdue, continued through the recession and Deal’s first four-year term and have cumulatively amounted to more than $8 billion across all school systems. Jason Carter, the Democratic nominee for governor, said the cuts devastated schools and blamed Deal. Deal’s comeback was that Carter voted for three, back-to-back $1 billion austerity cuts and against the 2015 budget with the smallest cut to education in years. With that background, we delve into the numbers. Records from the state Department of Education shows that K-12 education costs totalling about $10.4 billion in Fiscal 2002 were split three ways: with 56 percent covered by the state, 38 percent by locals and 6 percent by the federal government. Fast forward to the Fiscal 2013, the costs for K-12 education were $14.2 billion, and the split was 51 percent state funds, 41 percent local and 8 percent federal. That means Suggs was on target when she said the state’s share of school funding was down 5 percent to 51 percent in 2013, compared to 56 percent in 2002. We also examined K-12 spending for the years in between and saw plenty of fluctuation. For example, the state’s share fell to 51 percent as early as 2004 and to 43 percent at one point. The budget was propped up for a time by $1 billion in federal stimulus and held steady at 51 percent in Fiscal 2013 and 2014. Data isn’t yet available for Fiscal 2015 to see whether the percentage will change based on the decision by Deal and the General Assembly to reduce the current austerity cut to $749 million. That reduction was celebrated by local school districts, a majority of which qualify for extra state money each year as ""low wealth"" districts. Joe Martin, a longtime education advocate who helped develop the current funding formula, said that, when state funding declines, locals are usually left, with two options: make up the difference or cut instructional programs. ""This isn’t easy for any school system, but the systems with a low tax base per student are left in a terrible predicament,"" said Martin via email from Macedonia, where he’s currently serving in the Peace Corps. These districts ""never had much to begin with, compared with the systems that have much greater resources, but they are simply unable to close the gap,"" Martin said. Mike Griffin, senior policy analyst with the Education Commission of the States in Denver, said state funding generally decreased for public education nationally during the Great Recession as it did in smaller economic downturns in the 1980s and 1990s. Some states swapped out federal stimulus dollars for state dollars when they became available to fund education, although they shouldn’t have, Griffin said. ""When those federal dollars started to fade, some states weren’t in good enough shape to replace them,"" he said. Our conclusion: Suggs was accurate to say that the percentage of state funding for K-12 education was higher in 2002 than it was in 20013. To her larger point, the federal and local governments also have been paying larger shares through these years. But several factors were at play: the recession, the austerity cuts, the stimulus money. The austerity cut is smaller this year than in several years. That’s needed context. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jan/20/claire-suggs/analyst-target-education-spending/

Gwen Moore says local officials cannot repurpose federal streetcar grant to other needs
","In comments favoring a downtown Milwaukee streetcar system, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore tried to counter a key argument made by opponents regarding the $55 million in federal grant money tied to the project. ""As much as opponents would like these federal funds to be redirected to other modes of public transportation or to our public schools, this just isn't possible,"" the Milwaukee Democrat wrote in an opinion piece published Jan. 14, 2015 in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""Years ago, the Federal Transit Administration, a federal agency that provides financial and technical assistance to local public transit systems, made it abundantly clear that these funds could be used only for Milwaukee's streetcar project."" Milwaukee can take the money, Moore wrote, ""or we can walk away and leave millions of dollars on the table."" The Milwaukee Common Council is scheduled to vote Jan. 21, 2014 on the $124 million project. Two vocal opponents of Mayor Tom Barrett’s plan, Aldermen Joe Davis Sr. and Robert Donovan, have joined others in calling for spending the $54.9 million in federal transit funds for other projects or programs. Is Moore right that it’s streetcar or bust? Can this train change tracks? When asked for backup, Moore pointed us to a June 2011 letter from the FTA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation that provides financial and technical assistance to local public transit systems. The letter responded to questions from a streetcar supporter, Ald. Robert Bauman, concerning funds the FTA described as ""directed to the city of Milwaukee for the construction of a downtown streetcar line."" That letter, and comments to us by FTA officials, underscore that under current law the money is for the streetcar plan only. Bauman asked a question that is right on point: ""Under what circumstances, if any, can the funds appropriated to the city of Milwaukee be redirected to another transportation project in the city of Milwaukee or County of Milwaukee?"" In response, the FTA administrator at the time, Peter Rogoff, said it was his view that the DOT secretary had already approved the streetcar grant and therefore could not redirect the funds. He  wrote that lawyers with the Federal Highway Administration concurred with his interpretation. When we followed up with FTA communications officials about the 2011 letter, we were told it still stands. Milwaukee officials signed an agreement in 2012 with the FTA to spend the money on the downtown streetcar system. Milwaukee City Comptroller Martin Matson, an independently elected official, did not express a definitive opinion, but told us he believed the city would lose the money if the project was stopped at this point. All this backs up the guts of Moore’s claim. The money train Since the funding was granted through federal law, it does raise the question of whether federal law could be changed to shift the money to something else -- such as the north side rail project Davis advocates. Even proponents of the streetcar acknowledge that Congress, having written the law, could change it. Indeed, congressional action was how the streetcar money became untangled after a years-long dispute among Wisconsin officials over how to use federal transit funds originally allocated to the Milwaukee area in, yes, 1991. In 2009, Wisconsin Democrats in Congress inserted a provision into a massive federal spending bill that called for handing 60 percent of that money to the city for a downtown rail line and 40 percent  to Milwaukee County for buses. President Barack Obama signed the $410 billion package into law. Barrett, a former congressman, told the Shepherd Express in January 2015 that the reality is federal transit officials would take back the $55 million if the streetcar project is killed, and disburse it to another city. Two FTA officials told us that if the streetcar goes unbuilt, the grant money just sits there. At that point, they said, it would be up to Congress to put it back in circulation for some other project, in Milwaukee or elsewhere. ""As a matter of law, the ($55 million) cannot be redistributed to another transportation project unless Congress acts to amend the statute,"" Rogoff, the FTA administrator, wrote in his 2011 letter. Even powerful Wisconsin lawmakers -- including incoming Ways and Means Committee chair Paul Ryan, the Janesville Republican -- would need all of Congress to go along with picking another transit project, if they were inclined to get involved. And they would have to convince Congress that the city still deserves the money after 24 years of wrangling that has left the money unspent. It’s theoretically possible the money could be redirected for some other transit use in the area. But that is not something local officials can control, so the question before them is to use it for the street car or nothing at all. Our rating Moore said that federal officials declared that grant funds ""could be used only for Milwaukee's streetcar project,"" meaning it ""isn’t possible"" to redirect the money to ""other modes of public transportation or to our public schools."" Current law, and grant contracts, tie the grant money specifically to the streetcar project. In theory, Congress could intervene and re-purpose the funding, but there’s far from any guarantee that would happen -- or that Milwaukee would be re-awarded the money if it did. In any case, we can only base our rating on where things stand today, not where they might stand under different scenarios.

Ted Olson: Supreme Court never said marriage was between a man and a woman in 15 cases
","With the U.S. Supreme Court poised to decide whether same-sex marriage must be legal in all 50 states, Fox News Sunday pitted Family Research Council president Tony Perkins against former solicitor general Ted Olson for a Jan. 18 roundtable debate. There isn’t precedent for the Supreme Court justices to limit marriages to heterosexual couples only, said Olson, a Republican attorney who supports same-sex marriage and has argued 61 cases in front of the Supreme Court. ""The United States Supreme Court 15 times over the last 120 years has said that ‘marriage is a fundamental right,’"" Olson said. Perkins, a fervent opponent of same-sex marriage, interrupted: ""Marriage, but not same-sex marriage."" Olson continued, ""Never once in any of those cases did it say that it had to be between a man and a woman. Fifteen times it said it was a matter of privacy, liberty, association, dignity and respect for the individual."" We wondered about these 15 cases and if they really don’t define marriage as solely between a man and a woman. Olson pointed us to a brief he and his colleagues filed as the respondents in the 2013 case Hollingsworth vs. Perry, which the Supreme Court declined to hear, effectively sustaining a lower court decision to allow same-sex marriages in California. The brief says the Supreme Court has said marriage is a ""fundamental right"" in ""more than a dozen"" cases. ""In fact, this Court has characterized the right to marry as one of the most fundamental rights — if not the most fundamental right — of an individual,"" the brief said of Loving vs. Virginia, in which the Supreme Court approved interracial marriage. The cases he cited cover a range of topics, including privacy and parental and reproductive rights, but all touch on marriage as a ""fundamental right"" in some way. Here are the cases cited in the brief in chronological order: Maynard vs. Hill (1888) Meyer vs. Nebraska (1923) Skinner vs. Oklahoma ex. rel. Williamson (1942) Griswold vs. Connecticut (1965) Loving vs. Virginia (1967) Boddie vs. Connecticut (1971) Roe vs. Wade (1973) Cleveland Board of Education vs. LaFleur (1974) Carey vs. Population Services International (1977) Moore vs. City of East Cleveland (1977) Zablocki vs. Redhail (1978) Turner vs. Safley (1987) Planned Parenthood of Southeast Pennsylvania vs. Casey (1992) M.L.B. vs. S.L.J. (1996) Lawrence vs. Texas (2003) (They’re also listed with more detail in this blog post by the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a marriage equality advocacy group.) Outside legal experts reviewed the cases for us and said they support Olson’s claim that the Supreme Court has generally not addressed whether marriage is confined to heterosexual couples. The experts also said there are likely more than just 15 examples. ""The question was never asked,"" said Clifford Rosky, a law professor at the University of Utah. ""(Olson’s) correct to say that they’ve never specifically said marriage is just a man and a woman."" That is, until the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision to strike down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, ensuring same-sex couples get the same federal benefits as heterosexual couples. In this case, Rosky said, the court had to address the definition of marriage and said homosexual couples can be considered married. Until recent decades, some experts told us, the court likely assumed that when they said ""marriage,"" others would interpret that as meaning a heterosexual union, not a homosexual one, due to societal norms. ""Not a single one of these cases (in Olson’s list) would have been assuming anything but opposite-sex marriage,"" said Michael Klarman, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University. ""Before the 1990s, virtually nobody took the idea of same-sex marriage seriously."" In the 1960s, states began revising their laws to have more gender-neutral language, which raised questions about whether marriages should be extended to same-sex marriages if statutes do not specify otherwise, said Martha Umphrey, a professor of American government at Amherst College. Rogers Smith, an expert on constitutional law at the University of Pennsylvania, said other Supreme Court decisions show the tendency of justices to assume marriage means a heterosexual relationship. For example, they have sometimes linked the right to marry with the right to bear children. And in the 1961 case Poe vs. Ullman, Justice John Harlan argued that ""although the right to privacy protected rights of marital couples, it did not protect rights of homosexuals."" Perkins’ Family Research Council, says the fact that the Supreme Court has tied the ""right to marry"" to procreation is proof that this right only applies to opposite sex couples. Smith added that the examples in Olson’s list up to the 1960s tend to link marriage to the survival of the species and family life. But over time, the justices started to discuss the right to marry more as a right of all individuals and essential to human dignity and happiness. He said this reflects changing norms and makes denying same-sex couples the right to marry seem much more unreasonable than it would have in years past. Umphrey compared the current debate to that of interracial marriage. Until the years leading up to the Supreme Court’s 1967 decision that interracial marriages should be legal, most people -- including the justices -- assumed marriage meant a union between two people of the same race. Still, the Supreme Court used its own prior comments on marriage as a ""fundamental right"" as precedent for its decision. Our ruling Olson said, the ""Supreme Court 15 times over the last 120 years has said marriage is a fundamental right"" and never said ""it had to be between a man and a woman."" Olson provided a list of 15 cases that addressed marriage as something like a ""fundamental right"" that did not specify marriage as a union between a man and woman. Several experts backed up his claim. Until recent years, though, the Supreme Court never had to address the question of whether or not marriage should be limited to a man and woman. Because of societal norms, they assumed that the decision would be interpreted as referring to a heterosexual relationship. Still, Olson’s claim is on point.

Michigan Democrat: Romney 'pays less tax than the guys who installed his car elevators'
","Count on hearing a lot about federal taxes this week. In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama will lay out his plan to raise billions of dollars from the wealthiest people and the biggest financial institutions to make community college more affordable and pay for middle class tax cuts. And if that were not enough, we have the return of the 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Romney’s announcement that he’s seriously assessing a third White House bid has revived a conversation topic that bedeviled him the last go around -- that he’s too steeped in cash to connect with the struggles of the average American and benefits from a lopsided tax code. On Sunday, former Gov. Jennifer Granholm, D-Mich., gave a sign of what Romney can expect. Romney had told a gathering of Republicans in San Diego a couple days before that under Obama, ""the rich have gotten richer, income inequality has gotten worse, and there are more people in poverty than ever before."" Granholm said in sticking up for the little guy, Romney had an ""authenticity problem."" ""You know, he pays less tax than the guys who installed his car elevators,"" Granholm said on ABC News’ This Week. We decide to look into that claim. Echoes of 2012 What car elevators, you might ask? In the spring of 2012, the public learned that Romney’s plans for a multimillion dollar beach house in La Jolla, Calif., included an elevator to move cars from the basement to street level. Think of it as a way to get more than one car into a one-car garage. This add-on costs about $55,000 fully installed. (Construction on the site is underway, and we don’t know if the elevators are done yet.) Needless to say, this was an unwanted, if minor, distraction for the Romney campaign, which was already dealing with calls to be more transparent about the governor’s financial assets. As part of his presidential campaign, the former Massachusetts governor released two years of income tax returns. They showed that in 2010, he paid 13.9 percent of his reported income in federal taxes and in 2011, 15.3 percent. Those rates were a bit less than the national average. We don’t have all the details on his tax bills. The 2011 return was incomplete, and there was the possibility that Romney’s actual tax rate would be less. With that caveat, these are the best numbers we have. Granholm’s comment mirrored a running theme from the 2012 election that the tax code treats income from work and income from investments differently. Above a certain point, income from work is taxed at a higher rate than income from the stock market. Billionaire Warren Buffett memorably distilled this down to the line that he paid a lower tax rate than his secretary thanks to the favorable treatment of capital gains. Elevator installers Assessing whether the men who installed the elevators paid more in taxes than Romney is difficult. We reached out to Granholm and did not hear back. We take her words to refer to tax rates, not the total tax amounts. Romney made about $22 million a year and paid millions in taxes both years. From the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we see that in the San Diego metro area, the average elevator installer earned $83,460 in 2013. What an installer paid in taxes varies based on a number of factors, including family situation. If the installers were single with no children, then a simple tax calculator gives them an effective federal income tax rate of 17 percent. If they were married and had a child, and had no other income, the rate would fall to 8.4 percent. However, not only is that a bare-bones estimate, it fails to include payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. These payments represent a substantial portion of taxes paid by the average worker. The Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, uses a complicated tax simulator to estimate the total tax burden. The Tax Policy Center table for 2014 gives a total effective tax rate of 15.7 percent for households making between $75,000 and $100,000 a year. Take this number only as a rough guide. It includes various kinds of income, as well as a range of tax effects, and it blends together single as well as married filers. Comparing tax rates The point is, Granholm's claim could be right or wrong -- it just depends on a person's individual circumstances. A single, childless elevator installer with wages at the higher end of the scale might be paying at a higher rate than Romney did in 2011. That person's, even before payroll taxes, could be as high as 17 percent compared to Romney’s 15.3 percent. On the other hand, someone married and caring for a child could be paying as little as 8.4 percent. Our ruling Granholm said that Romney paid less tax than the guys that installed his car elevator.  On the most literal level, we don't even know if the car elevators have been installed. And we don't know anything about the people who did the work. In a broader sense, what elevator installers pay in federal taxes depends on their personal circumstances. They could be taxed at a higher -- or lower -- rate than Romney has been. This statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/jan/18/jennifer-granholm/former-michigan-gov-romney-pays-less-tax-guys-who-/

The curious case of the Khrushchev shoe
","Adults of a certain age -- those who lived through the Cold War, specifically the era in which the Soviet Union was ruled by Nikita Khrushchev -- will remember hearing how the volatile leader demanded attention during a session of the United Nations by taking off a shoe and banging it on his desk. The History Channel website refers to it as ""one of the most surreal moments in the history of the Cold War."" In a Dec. 26 commentary in The Providence Journal, Arthur Cyr, a professor at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wis., offered an intriguing detail about the incident. While discussing Cuba and President Obama's effort to reestablish ties with the country, Cyr mentioned the relationship between Cuba and the Soviet Union. Cuban leader ""Fidel Castro highlighted alliance with the Soviet Union by joining Nikita Khrushchev in a raucous 1960 visit to the United Nations. The New York session was punctuated by the Soviet leader publicly pounding a shoe on a desk (while wearing two shoes),"" Cyr wrote. The shoe Khrushchev famously pounded on the table at the U.N. was a spare? That struck us as a surprising historical footnote -- so surprising we wondered why we hadn't heard about this third shoe before. Why bring a special shoe to a debate when you're wearing two that would easily serve as makeshift gavels? Intrigued, we sought details. We thought we might find some information at Wikipedia. Sure enough, there's a whole page devoted to the ""shoe-banging incident."" But it makes no mention of a third shoe. More surprisingly, it turns out that there's good reason to question whether Khrushchev ever banged his shoe at all. First, we emailed Cyr, asking for the source for his twist on the story. He said it came from ""The Soviet Union 1917-1991"" by Martin McCauley, a senior lecturer at the University of London. Cyr quoted page 273 of the book: ""It was all premeditated. Careful examination of the shoe-bashing incident reveals he was wearing two shoes at the time."" We wrote back to Cyr, asking if McCauley cited any source that might indicate what type of ""careful examination"" was done, especially when there are questions about whether the shoe bashing occurred at all. Cyr never responded. So we bought the book. McCauley, who has 41 footnotes for that chapter alone, lists no source for the factoid. Nor does he offer any specifics about the ""careful examination."" So we emailed him. ""My source for the Khrushchev shoe banging episode was a Russian,"" he responded. ""Unfortunately it is too long ago to remember who gave me the information."" Thus, there's no hard evidence a third shoe was used in an attempt to clog the debate, as it were. And we noticed something else. In his book, McCauley reports that Khrushchev ""shouted, laughed and interrupted speakers and even banged his shoe on his desk during Harold Macmillan's speech."" Macmillan was the British prime minister at the time. That's interesting because, according to U.N. records, Macmillan didn't address the General Assembly on the day of the alleged footwear incident, and the New York Times, which reported the story on the front page of its Oct. 13 edition, gave a very different account. On Oct. 12, the Times says, ""Mr. Khrushchev was apparently infuriated by a statement by Lorenzo Sumulong, a member of the Philippine delegation. . . . Mr. Khrushchev thereupon pulled off his right shoe, stood up and brandished the shoe at the Philippine delegate on the other side of the hall. He then banged the shoe on his desk."" Not only does the Times say Khrushchev used his own shoe, but the paper identifies it as his right shoe. Nonetheless, as we noted earlier, questions have been raised about whether the shoe-banging occurred at all. It's clear that there was a shoe. The Oct. 13 Times story is accompanied by a photograph of a shoe on Khrushchev's desk. The question is whether he ever used it as a gavel. As the Wikipedia article and the sources it cites make clear, there are many versions floating around. So many, in fact, that the affair sounds like it might be an urban legend. A photograph of the Soviet leader holding up a shoe, which was run by Time magazine, has widely been discounted as a fake (Wikipedia has the undoctored and doctored images). In fact, despite of all the media covering the session, there is no photographic record of Khrushchev banging his shoe. Khrushchev's son, Sergei, who has lived in Rhode Island since 1991, told us that he and his family sought photographic evidence from the archives of NBC and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. They came up empty-handed. When Amherst College political science professor William Taubman -- who originally believed that Khrushchev used the shoe to bang on the table -- revisited the question for a 2003 article, he reported that another Times correspondent, James Feron, who was also at the U.N. at the time, insisted that the Soviet leader never banged it. Khrushchev ""leaned over, took off a slip-on shoe, waved it pseudomenacingly, and put it on his desk, but he never banged his shoe,"" Taubman quotes Feron as saying. Feron told Taubman that the author of the Times article, Benjamin Welles, didn't witness the banging but based his story on second-hand accounts. Taubman, a Khrushchev biographer, also quotes John Loengard, a former picture editor for Life magazine, as reporting that Khrushchev reached down, took off a brown loafer, put it on his desk and signaled to some delegates that he was going to bang his shoe. About 10 photographers in the press booth were poised to capture the event. They were disappointed. ""He only put it on again and left. None of us missed the picture -- which would have been a serious professional error. The event never occurred,"" Loengard told Taubman. ""I still go with the theory that there were two shoes, that he brandished one of them, but that he did not actually bang either of them on the table at the United Nations,"" Taubman told us in an email. We will note, just as a matter of speculation, that there's another possibility, one that arises from that 1960 New York Times account. The Times reported there was a second shoe incident soon after the first. ""Later,"" the Times reported, ""during the debate on colonialism in which tempers flared among several delegations, Mr. Khrushchev alternately shouted, waved a brawny right arm, shook his finger and removed his shoe a second time. The second shoe incident occurred during a speech by Francis O. Wilcox, an Assistant United States Secretary of State. Mr. Khrushchev and Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko exchanged smiles and winks and Mr. Khrushchev then reached down and slipped his shoe back on."" Perhaps Khrushchev did bang his shoe and most people missed it. And when word spread to the photographers to focus on Khrushchev, the Soviet leader didn't deliver. That would also explain why the only photographic evidence the Times had was the photo of the shoe sitting on his desk. Our ruling Commentator Arthur Cyr stated that Nikita Khrushchev brought an extra shoe to a United Nations session, which he used to bang on the desk in protest in 1960. His sole piece of evidence is a statement in a Martin McCauley book that talks about ""careful examination of the shoe-bashing incident."" But McCauley doesn't cite a source or outline the evidence that was supposedly the subject of ""careful examination."" And now, more than two decades later, he can't remember who told him. So at this point, there is no solid evidence for a third shoe. Meanwhile, the New York Times account from that era states that Khrushchev took off his own shoe. We can't resolve the controversy over whether Khrushchev used it as a gavel. But, based on the absence of evidence, we rate Cyr's Third Shoe claim as False. READ Cyr's rebuttal.    (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)",/factchecks/2015/jan/18/arthur-cyr/curious-case-khrushchev-shoe/
"['Energy', 'Virginia', 'Bobby  Scott']","
Bobby Scott: Low gas prices are the result of Obama policies
","One of the first actions by the U.S. House of Representatives this year was to pass a bill approving the Keystone XL pipeline. House Republicans, who boosted their majority in fall elections, have long said that oil pipeline would fortify the nation’s energy supply and help keep a lid on gas prices. The nearly 1,200-mile pipeline  would send up to 830,000 barrels of oil a day from the Alberta oil sands in Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would be piped to Gulf Coast refineries. But Rep. Bobby Scott, D-3rd, doesn’t buy that argument. He voted against the measure, which President Barack Obama vows to veto if it clears the Senate. In a Jan. 9 news release, Scott noted gas prices are already at their lowest levels in years and added this observation: ""Instead of exempting foreign corporations from federal permitting requirements, Congress should be working on policies that diversify our nation’s energy portfolio, reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and support the president’s policies that have resulted in gas prices being reduced from $3.07 per gallon when he was sworn in in 2009 to $2.30 today,"" Scott said. We looked into Scott’s claim that Obama’s policies has resulted in a 77-cent per gallon drop in gas prices since the president’s first inauguration. The numbers We quickly learned that Scott’s figures are wrong. The price of gas increased by about 36-cents a gallon from the start of Obama’s presidency to the time Scott made his statement. On Jan. 19, 2009, the day before Obama was inaugurated, the average national price of regular gas was $1.85 per gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In December 2008 and January 2009, it remained below $2 a gallon -- the low watermark over the past 10 years. The U.S. was in the teeth of the Great Recession then and analysts largely attributed the low prices to a drop in gas demand. So the price of gas when Obama took office was $1.22 a gallon cheaper than the $3.07 average Scott cited. David Dailey, a spokesman for Scott, told us the congressman’s office made an ""honest mistake"" by starting the comparison on the drop in gas prices figures on Jan. 21, 2008 -- when records show gas averaged $3.02 per gallon. When Scott made his statement on Jan. 9, the price of gas was $2.21 per gallon. And it’s fallen further since. At this writing, the average price is $2.14 a gallon, the lowest level since May 2009. That’s a steep drop from the highwater mark of $3.94 a gallon in April 2012. Obama’s role Scott’s office reissued the news release on Jan. 12, taking out the numbers but continuing to say the president’s policies ""have resulted in gas prices being reduced to lows not seen in years."" To back Scott’s contention, Dailey pointed to EIA reports showing that during Obama’s administration, domestic production of crude oil has risen from 5.4 million barrels a day in the first quarter of 2009 to 9.1 million barrels daily in the last three months of 2014. Dailey also cited figures showing that net imports of liquid fuels have dropped during Obama’s term. Dailey said the White House’s insistence on tougher standards for greenhouse gas emissions and vehicle fuel efficiency have helped lead to a drop in gas consumption. He pointed to a March 2014 report from the nonpartisan General Accounting Office which says those initiatives ""have contributed to reductions in the consumption of petroleum fuels, but the extent is unclear."" But Scott’s statements go beyond saying the president’s policies have merely contributed to today’s low gas prices. The congressman said the policies ""have resulted in gas prices being reduced  to lows not seen in years."" That gives all credit to Obama. We spoke to two oil analysts and they both took issue with Scott’s claim. ""I would challenge any politician who is saying the recent six-month downturn in gas prices has anything to do with a politician (Obama) who has been in office for several years, who has witnessed a sustained period of high prices,"" said Patrick DeHaan, a senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com, which tracks U.S. gas prices. Government actions typically have little impact on the fluctuation of gas prices, he said. DeHaan credits the increased domestic oil production to decisions by oil companies to invest profits banked just before Obama took office in tapping shale oil deposits in North Dakota and elsewhere. The main factor in the recent price drop, DeHaan said, is a decision by OPEC countries not to cut production to drive up oil demand. OPEC believes the declining prices, left unabated, will make the production of shale oil unprofitable. Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, told us neither Obama nor any elected official is responsible for the oil shale boom, which he attributes to other factors such as technological advances in tapping oil deposits. ""The oil shale boom took place while President Obama was in office, but the production increases had little to do with government policy (other than low interest rates from Fed governors),"" Kloza wrote in an email. Kloza, however, does give Obama credit for supporting tough fuel economy standards that he said has contributed to lower prices. ""Almost all of what has happened (up and down) for oil within the 2009-to-present period has occurred through capitalism,"" wrote Kloza. ""The president can neither be blamed nor praised for most of the fluctuations."" We also point out that beyond rising U.S. production and OPEC’s decision against cutting production, other factors have been cited for lowered gas prices, including economic stagnation in Europe. Our ruling  Scott says Obama’s policies have resulted in a 77-cent per gallon drop in the price of gas since the president took office. Scott’s office acknowledges its numbers were wrong. At this writing, gas has actually increased by 36-cents a gallon since Obama entered the White House. That’s because at the time of his inauguration, volatile gas prices had dipped to the lowest levels in the last 10 years. Experts say presidents have little control over the cost of filling your car. Gas prices rise and fall in response to worldwide economic conditions, production decisions made by oil-producing nations, and the investment decisions of oil companies. Obama didn’t cause the roller coaster rise is gas prices that began shortly after his first inauguration, nor did he cause the sharp fall that now thrills drivers. So we rate Scott’s statement False.",/factchecks/2015/jan/18/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-low-gas-prices-are-result-obama-polici/

Buckhorn balanced city budget without raising taxes, TV ad says
","Ever since Florida’s real estate bubble burst, planning a budget that meets the city’s needs while living within its means has been among Bob Buckhorn’s chief challenges as mayor. For this year, Buckhorn proposed an $876 million budget that included a 2.5 percent raise for city employees and started replenishing city reserves, which he had drawn on to balance his previous budgets. Now, as he seeks a second four-year term, Buckhorn is running a cable television ad that says, ""Bob balanced the budget without raising taxes."" But did he? Two elements go into property owners’ annual tax bills: the value of their property and the tax rate. The first is assessed by county property appraisers. The second is set by local governments. Multiply the assessment by the tax rate — expressed in mills, with 1 mill equaling $1 in property tax for every $1,000 of assessed, taxable value — and that equals the tax owed. In Tampa, the city has kept the same tax rate — about 5.73 mills, or $5.73 in city taxes for every $1,000 of assessed taxable property value — for eight years. And Buckhorn notes that the city kept that rate even during the recession, when property values plunged, dragging the city’s revenues down with them.  City property tax revenues fell from a high of $160 million in 2009 to about $117.4 million in 2013. During that time, Buckhorn said, the city didn’t raise its tax rate to try to capture more revenue. ""When we were faced with a drastic decline in revenues, we didn’t raise the rates to compensate,"" Buckhorn told PolitiFact Florida in an interview in his office on Jan. 13, 2015. ""So we’ve been consistent about this, and losing $40 million in revenue out of $160 million took a huge toll on us, but to compensate for that, we didn’t bump it up to raise the like amount. We just did more with less money. We ended up laying off 700 people."" In the last two fiscal years, property values have started to rise again, so that the same tax rate now generates more revenue for the city — $123.5 million last year and an expected $132.2 million this year. Buckhorn said there’s been no tax increase because he did not raise the property tax rate. And he said at the existing tax rate it will take years for the city’s property tax revenues to climb back to where they were. ""When people think of taxes,"" he said, the tax rate is ""largely what they think about. That's what they react to."" But the relationship between tax rates, the value of property and the amount of tax the two generate together has been the focus of Florida’s Truth in Millage (TRIM) law since it was passed in 1980. The TRIM law requires local governments to tell taxpayers what property tax rate would generate the same revenues for the coming year as in the current year. If property values — not including things like new construction and building additions — have risen, then the calculation determines how much officials would have to ""roll back"" the tax rate to generate the same level of revenue. If they propose a higher rate — including by keeping the rate they already have — then the law requires them to advertise a tax increase. That’s what the city of Tampa has done the last two years. For the city of Tampa's 2013-14 fiscal year, the adopted rate was 4.4 percent higher than the rollback rate. For the 2014-15 fiscal year, the adopted rate was about 5.2 percent higher than the rollback rate. Buckhorn said the additional revenue generated by keeping the same property tax rate instead of lowering it to the rollback rate does not count as raising taxes. ""That is a function of the value of the property,"" Buckhorn said. ""It's not a function of the baseline tax (rate) that the city assesses. If I had raised the property tax rate, then I couldn't have made that statement. There's a difference between somebody paying more because the value of their house increases versus the city assessing a higher rate to generate more revenue."" That line of thinking, however, was what legislators were trying to push back when they wrote the Truth in Millage law in 1980. ""This attempt by local officials to blame rising property taxes on increasing assessments and thereby ‘share’ the responsibility for tax hikes with the property appraisers is precisely the problem the TRIM disclosure provisions seek to resolve,""  according to a Florida State University Law Review article co-authored by then-House Finance and Taxation Committee chairman Steve Pajcic the year the law was passed. Before then, many taxpayers had focused on appealing their assessments, but with the TRIM law the Legislature was trying ""to alert taxpayers to the importance of the millage rate and to encourage them to view it as the factor over which they have the most control,"" Pajcic and his co-authors wrote. ""It is an incorrect statement to say that you haven’t increased taxes if you don’t go back to the roll-back rate, because you have,"" Benjamin Phipps, a Tallahassee attorney and expert on property taxation who served as counsel to the Florida House of Representatives Tax Committee and the speaker of the House in the 1970s, told PolitiFact Florida on Jan. 14, 2015. Buckhorn’s TV ad says he ""balanced the budget without raising taxes."" Because the city kept its property tax rate constant even as the total value of property in the city rose, the city has seen its property tax revenues rise the past two fiscal years. And it has been required by state law to advertise a tax increase for both of those years. Tax revenues are still significantly below what they were before the real estate crash.

","Turning 40? Sen. Rand Paul says you can look forward to back pain in your near future, and maybe some anxiety. But don’t try to turn your ailments into a government check. At a breakfast event Wednesday, Jan. 14 in New Hampshire, the Kentucky Republican and potential presidential candidate spoke out against a public safety net that catches too many people who don’t need help. ""The thing is, all of these programs, there’s always somebody who’s deserving. (But) everybody in this room knows somebody who is gaming the system,"" Paul said. The proof? Look no further than the diagnoses landing people on disability, he added. ""Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts. Join the club,"" he said to laughter. ""Who doesn’t get up a little anxious for work every day and their back hurts? Everybody over 40 has a little back pain."" Paul may be having a little fun about the aches and pains of growing older, but his comment raises serious questions about a program relied on by millions of people. Is the majority of the disability population suffering from back pain and anxiety? We decided to check the numbers. Identifying the problem The Social Security Administration has provided benefits to people with disabilities since President Dwight Eisenhower signed legislation in 1956. The program is intended to provide cash assistance to people who are disabled for a year or longer and cannot work or can only work menial jobs for little pay (about $1,000 a month). The number of individuals receiving disability has been on an upward trajectory for decades. In 1970, there were less than 2 million beneficiaries; now, the program has surpassed 10 million, far outpacing U.S. population growth. Nearly two-thirds of people on disability are 50 or older. The large growth in the program has sparked claims of waste, fraud and abuse. And indeed, several reports from the Government Accountability Office have found problems with the program, as Paul’s office pointed out. After an audit of disability insurance in 2013, the Government Accountability Office estimated that  in fiscal year 2011, the Social Security Administration made $1.29 billion in potential cash benefit overpayments to about 36,000 individuals who were working and making more than $1,100 a month (the limit to receive disability benefits). The 36,000 people receiving improper payments, while a lot on paper, represent about 0.4 percent of all beneficiaries, the report said. There are other ways Social Security gives out benefits to those not deserving, but paying people already working is about 72 percent of the problem, according to the Social Security Administration. Factoring that in, the GAO estimates overpayments equaled $1.62 billion, or 1.27 percent of all disability benefits, in 2011. It’s a lot of money, but the disability program is a $128 billion program. The Government Accountability Office goes on to say the exact number of improper payments is unknown. It could be higher. Additionally, another GAO report warned the Social Security Administration’s efforts to thwart potential physician-assisted fraud are ""hampered by a lack of planning, data, and coordination."" Back and anxiety Let’s narrow in on Paul’s specific claim: ""Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts."" This is not rooted in the official numbers. Social Security does not group people by back pain or anxiety in any of their published reports. Instead, they track a much broader list of physical and mental ailments. What would back pain or anxiety fall under? Most back problems would fall under the category ""diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,"" the most common ailment. In 2013, 27.7 percent of all people received benefits for these types of ailments. If you look at just workers, it was 30.5 percent. There's also another category, ""injuries,"" that might include some back problems. Those affect another 4 percent of workers. But not all musculoskeletal system and connective tissue diseases are back problems. Far from it. They include ailments ranging from a broken bone and bad burns to amputated limbs and deformities. Anxiety would be included in ""mental disorders."" That category is broken down further as follows:  As you can see, it's a pretty confusing list, and it's not immediately clear which category certain mental ailments would fall into. If by ""anxious,"" Paul meant a catchall term for all mental disorders, then, sure, about one-third of all disabled workers have some sort of mental issue.  Paul's spokesman singled out the subcategory ""mood disorders"" when explaining how Paul reached his conclusion. Other media outlets have similarly placed anxiety under this heading. However, the Social Security Administration told us that category typically includes affective disorders like depression, not anxiety disorders. Instead, people suffering from ""anxiety disorders"" -- which include things like post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder -- are included in the ""other"" category. That category also includes diseases like Tourette syndrome and affects far fewer people than mood disorders, about 3.9 percent.  For the sake of argument, let's follow Paul's faulty logic. Even assuming generously that every single person with a musculoskeletal system problem came in with ""back pain,"" and every person with a ""mood disorder"" had anxiety, it still only equals 45.4 percent, less than half. Throw in ""other"" mental disorders, you're still just below 50 percent. If you categorize anxiety correctly as ""other"" and add it to all musculoskeletal system problems, you would end up far lower, at 34 percent. And again, not every person with a musculoskeletal problem has a back problem, and not every person with a mental disorder has anxiety. For Paul to imply as much is either stretching reality or downplaying serious ailments. There has been an increase in the number of people receiving disability for musculoskeletal system and mental problems. In 1961, the most common ailment for new beneficiaries was heart disease or stroke. Meanwhile, 8 percent of those going on disability received assistance for musculoskeletal system issues. That’s an interesting and notable statistic, and one worth exploring. NPR published a very extensive report suggesting some older, unskilled workers are going on disability (many with back issues) because the only jobs available to them are physically strenuous. But that doesn’t wash away Paul’s mischaracterization of the ailments nor his inflation of the numbers. Our ruling Paul said, ""Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts."" The numbers don’t add up. The two broader disability categories that include back pain (""diseases of the musculoskeletal system"") and anxiety disorders (""mental disorders - other"") don’t even equal close to 50 percent, let alone those two ailments by themselves. Paul’s quip might make for a good soundbite, but it’s not rooted in reality. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2015/jan/16/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-most-people-receive-disability-back/

Scott Walker's shifting position on the Common Core education standards
","Abruptly and unmistakably, Gov. Scott Walker stated a position on what nationally had become a contentious issue among conservatives: the Common Core education standards. His one-sentence announcement on July 17, 2014 read: ""Today, I call on the members of the state Legislature to pass a bill in early January (2015) to repeal Common Core and replace it with standards set by people in Wisconsin."" Previously, Walker’s position had not been so stark. Later, after his State of the State speech on Jan. 13, 2015, it became even less clear.    All as Walker embarks on a second term and, increasingly, captures attention as a potential 2016 candidate for The White House. So has Walker has done any sort of flip-flop on Common Core? As we turn to our Flip-O-Meter, it’s important to note we’re not making a value judgment about changing a position. Rather, we are looking at whether Walker has been consistent in his stance, or changed it. Some argue a change in position shows inconsistent principles or lack of backbone, others see it as pragmatism or a willingness to compromise. Walker support The Common Core State Standards were in place in Wisconsin before Walker became governor in January 2011. State schools superintendent Tony Evers had adopted them for the state, without controversy, seven months earlier. (Evers has remained a strong Common Core supporter.) Common Core is a set of standards for English and math unveiled in 2010 that came out of years of discussion between private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal was to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts. The federal government has had a role in encouraging states to adopt the standards, but they are voluntary. Walker gave a nod to Common Core in his first state budget, which became law in June 2011. It directed Evers’ Department of Public Instruction to come up with a new statewide test for school children, and that test would have to ""measure mastery"" of the Common Core standards. Seven months later, in January 2012, a report was issued by the state Read to Lead Task Force, which was formed by Walker and Evers, and chaired by Walker. The report made recommendations on improving children’s reading. It noted Wisconsin was among the first states to adopt the Common Core standards, which it called ""rigorous."" And one of the recommendations was to ensure that the state’s early learning standards aligned with Common Core. In April 2013, Alan J. Borsuk, an education fellow at Marquette University, observed in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel commentary that nearly three years after its adoption in Wisconsin, Common Core was little known outside of education circles. Walker ""has been low key in his support, but nonetheless has been on board,"" Borsuk wrote. ""Implementation is one of the things that Walker and Evers have cooperated on. There is criticism and opposition, but it has been pretty low volume."" So, Walker showed tacit support for Common Core during most of his first term. Then there was change. Review, repeal Walker’s second state budget became law in June 2013. It prohibited the Department of Public Instruction from ""directing school districts"" to do further implementation of Common Core. But Common Core standards adopted by the state superintendent to that point remained in effect. Seven months later, in January 2014, Walker went further. In a speech at the State Education Convention, the governor said he was working on legislation to create a commission (to be chaired by Evers) to revisit the Common Core standards. Walker said they weren't high enough and were being dictated by people who weren't from Wisconsin, when they should be ""driven by people in Wisconsin."" Then six months after his speech -- and facing a formidable challenge from Democrat Mary Burke in his bid for re-election -- Walker issued his out-of-the-blue July 2014 news release calling for Common Core to be repealed (a stance he later reiterated). ""The declaration comes after months of virtually no public debate among Wisconsin lawmakers on the standards,"" a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article reported. ""Earlier this year, a proposal in the Legislature to undo them went nowhere, with Walker saying little."" Borsuk, of Marquette, wrote: ""The one-sentence news release issued by Walker symbolized how little this controversy has to do with serious work on specific aims for children's education and how much this is about politics and appealing to blocs of voters as the November (2014) election approaches."" Stepping back As definitive as Walker’s position had seemed to become, it would shift again. On Jan. 5, 2015, the day of Walker’s inauguration for his second term, The Daily Caller published comments from Laurel Patrick, the governor’s press secretary. She spoke of repealing Common Core -- but of something less than that, as well. ""As he works to continue transforming education, Gov. Walker will work with the Legislature on an education reform bill that includes accountability for all schools receiving state funds, as well as a repeal of Common Core,"" Patrick was quoted as saying. But she added: ""The bottom line is he wants to make sure that no school district in the state is required to use the Common Core standards."" That led Truth in American Education to accuse Walker of sending mixed signals. The group, which opposes Common Core, said ""making ‘sure that no school district in the state is required to use the Common Core standards’ sounds nice, but that is an opt-out not a repeal ….Walker needs to stop saying he wants Common Core repealed, but then signal that he will settle for a weaker opt-out bill."" A week later, in his State of the State address, Walker made no mention of repeal and seemed to be leaning toward opt-out, saying:   ""I call on the members of the state Legislature to pass legislation making it crystal clear that no school district in the state is required to use Common Core standards. Going forward, I want to eliminate any requirement to use Common Core."" Our rating Walker hasn't explicitly advocated the Common Core education standards, but his position has varied. During most of his first term, the governor showed tacit support. By mid-2013, he was hitting the pause button on further implementation of the standards. In mid-2014, Walker called for an outright repeal. But by January 2015, he was saying only that he didn’t want school districts required to use Common Core. For a partial change of position and inconsistent statements, our rating is a Half Flip. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

"['Energy', 'Florida', 'Floridians for Solar Choice']","
Florida is one of five states that ban certain solar sales, petition group says
","When it comes to solar, the Sunshine State is, well, in the dark, say advocates. A coalition of folks across the political spectrum ranging from tea party activists to environmentalists have united to launch a campaign to allow the direct sale of solar energy to consumers. Currently, state law only allows utilities to sell power, but a new political action committee, Floridians for Solar Choice, wants to change that. The PAC seeks to get a referendum on the ballot for the 2016 election. They will need 683,149 signatures by Feb. 1, 2016 -- an effort that could cost millions of dollars. The PAC argues that Florida is out of touch with the majority of states on solar. ""Currently, Florida is one of only five states in the nation that prohibit citizens from buying electricity from companies that will put solar panels on your home or business,"" according to the group’s website. We decided to shed a little light on how Florida stacks up on solar energy. While solar has been expanding nationally, Florida isn’t a solar leader: it ranks third in solar capacity but 13th in installations, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Solar represents less than 1 percent of Florida's energy generation, and the state projects only a tiny fraction of percentage growth over the next decade. In November, the Public Service Commission approved allowing utilities to end solar rebates in 2015 and gut energy efficiency goals by 90 percent, because the utilities claimed neither is ""cost-effective."" The source of the data on the 5-state ban Florida law only allows a few utilities such as Florida Power & Light, Duke Energy and Tampa Electric to sell power directly to consumers. If a solar power generator wants to get into the state market, it must first sell to one of those utilities. Floridians for Solar Choice want to make it cheaper for residents to buy solar power directly from a provider. The evidence that only five states forbid that kind of direct sale comes from a map from the Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy (DSIRE), a project based at North Carolina State University funded in part by the U.S. Department of Energy. The map shows the states that allow third-party solar power agreements. Under power purchase agreements (PPAs), an installer/developer builds a solar system on a customer’s property for free and then the developer sells the power to the customer. The map, dated November 2014, shows that at least 24 states allow these third-party solar agreements - though in some states there are certain restrictions, such as only allowing them of a certain size or on a type of property. The five states that don’t allow any such agreements are Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina and Oklahoma. The map shows the status as unclear or unknown in 21 states. The states that are unclear or are unknown are ""because the statutory law is silent about the issue and from what we can gather, no solar companies in these states have attempted to sell electricity directly to a customer,"" said Brian Lips, DSIRE Project Manager. That means those 21 states are in a legal gray area, said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the Solar Energy Industries Association. ""It isn’t specifically allowed or disallowed, but given the laws in place, it’s not hard to imagine that a court would uphold the utility’s exclusivity,"" Johnson said. ""Most states don’t go so far to protect monopoly utilities, but Florida is one of them."" Another way to compare states on solar We sent the group’s claim to spokespersons for Florida’s Public Service Commission and utilities including Duke Energy to ask if they had any information to refute or support the claim. A spokesman for Duke Energy directed us to Solar Power Rocks,  a research and advocacy organization which ranks the states on solar policies. On this ranking, Florida landed in the middle of the pack with a  ""C"" and 24th among the states. But this website doesn’t take into account the third-party PPAs -- it considers other factors such as whether states offer tax exemptions or rebates for solar. A spokeswoman for the Public Service Commission, Cindy Muir, questioned characterizing Florida as one of only five states with such a ban, since 21 states are classified as unknown. Muir also said that Florida law does allow leases for solar. Under that scenario, a developer installs the solar energy system and the customer pays for it over years rather than paying for the power  produced. The advantage of the PPA is that the customer doesn’t hold the production risk. Under a lease, the customer can end up paying the same whether the system ends up producing 100 percent of expected electricity or a lesser amount, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Our ruling ""Currently, Florida is one of only five states in the nation that prohibit citizens from buying electricity from companies that will put solar panels on your home or business,"" says Floridians for Solar Choice website. That statistic comes from a respected academic source that published its findings in 2014. However, the statement doesn’t mean that 45 states allow sales. Currently, 24 states specifically allow an entity to build a solar system on a customer’s property and then sell the power to the customer. In 21 states, the status is unclear or unknown, and pro-solar advocates say few if any sales are happening there. Still, the claim is accurate that only five states specifically prohibit these types of sales. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jan/16/floridians-solar-choice/florida-one-five-states-ban-certain-solar-sales-pe/
