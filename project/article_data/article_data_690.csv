Donald Trump exaggerates costs of health care for undocumented immigrants in State of the Union
","In his 2020 State of the Union address, President Donald Trump attempted to tie a Democratic proposal for health care reform to one of his signature issues: immigration.  ""Over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders,"" Trump said Feb. 4. That appears to be a reference to the ""Medicare for All"" bills put forth in the Senate and House by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) that would establish a universal, government-funded health care system. They’re the flagship Medicare for All proposals  and have shaped a large portion of the 2020 campaign discourse on health care. We reached out to the White House to confirm that Trump was referring to these plans, but didn’t hear back.  That said, Trump has made similar remarks before about Medicare for All. And he is on target with his co-sponsor estimate for these bills. The Sanders measure has 14 Senate co-sponsors and the Jayapal legislation has 118 in the House. His remarks were dramatic, though, in highlighting the proposal’s alleged consequences for undocumented immigrants. And health policy experts told us Trump missed the mark. Trump is correct in his understanding that these proposals were intended to provide coverage regardless of immigration status.  But evidence does not support his argument that Medicare for All would ""bankrupt"" the country by extending health insurance coverage to everyone, and to immigrants in the country illegally in particular.  One point: While the single-payer system outlined in the pending legislative proposals would increase public spending — and by a significant amount — its backers say that total health care spending likely wouldn’t change that much. That’s because, as the plan is envisioned, while government spending would go up, private health expenditures would disappear. ""Medicare for All would dramatically shift how we pay for health care, but not necessarily how much we spend in total,"" said Larry Levitt, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""It’s hard to make the case that it would bankrupt the country."" (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)  Furthermore, to suggest that providing them with insurance would bankrupt the country is misleading. Those immigrants make up a small size of the population — about 11 million, compared to the total national population of approximately 372 million.  ""A very, very small percentage of the total cost is associated with that 11 million people,"" said Linda Blumberg, an analyst at the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. ""We’re talking about a strawman."" In fact, she noted, many existing programs on the state, county and local level already provide health benefits to undocumented immigrants. Those programs haven’t led to bankruptcy. Trump’s claim on health care for undocumented immigrants was part of a larger broadside on Democratic health proposals. He also argued Democrats would ""impose a socialist takeover of our health care system"" and ""raid the Medicare benefits our seniors depend on."" Those statements are also misleading.  For one thing, Levitt noted, Medicare for All would not socialize the medical care system, even if it would replace private insurance with all public programs. Under the current proposals, hospitals and doctors would still stand as private entities. ""It would in no way mean a socialist takeover of the health care system,"" Levitt said. ""When Americans think of health care, I suspect they think of the people who actually deliver that care."" The idea of ""raiding"" Medicare is also tricky, as we noted last October. While the single-payer plan would replace conventional Medicare with a new government program, that program (according to the Sanders and Jayapal bills) would have more generous benefits than Medicare currently offers. If anything, then, benefits wouldn’t be raided; they would be bolstered. The result, analysts said: a series of arguments that distracts from the actual debate at hand. ""It is worthwhile having a serious debate over the inherent tradeoffs of the reform being discussed,"" Blumberg said. ""But this is the same kind of throwaway line and inflammatory language to thwart serious conversation. The president said Medicare for All would ""bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer-funded health care to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders."" While the program is meant to cover undocumented people, it is, at best, a gross exaggeration to suggest this expense would ""bankrupt"" the United States, especially since Medicare for All’s overall price-tag looks fairly similar to what we currently spend on health care. (It changes who pays.)

Nancy Pelosi deviated from tradition in introducing President Trump at 2020 State of the Union
","Following President Donald Trump’s 2020 State of the Union Address, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., ripped up a copy of Trump’s speech in full view of the cameras. But earlier, she made a less dramatic deviation from protocol. CNN host Jake Tapper noted the shift in his post-speech analysis, as well as in a tweet that attracted more than 36,000 likes. Tapper wrote, ""Traditionally, the Speaker says: ‘Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States.’ (Tonight) Speaker Pelosi said, ‘Members of Congress, the President of the United States.’ "" Tapper is right, we found.  We looked back at all of the speaker-president interactions in State of the Union addresses going back to 2007, which was Pelosi’s first as speaker. (The 2009 and 2017 addresses are technically not considered State of the Union addresses, but we counted them too.) Between the 2007 and 2018 addresses, every speaker has said something very close to the following: ""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States."" Here’s the rundown, with links to the video. 2007: Pelosi to President George W. Bush: ""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States."" 2008: Pelosi to Bush: ""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States."" 2009: Pelosi to President Barack Obama: ""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States."" 2010: Pelosi to Obama: ""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States."" 2011: House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to Obama: ""I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting the president of the United States."" 2012: Boehner to Obama: ""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States."" 2013: Boehner to Obama: ""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States."" 2014: Boehner to Obama: ""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States."" 2015: Boehner to Obama: ""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States."" 2016: Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to Obama: ""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States."" 2017: Ryan to Trump: ""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States."" 2018: Ryan to Trump: ""Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States."" The pattern changed abruptly in 2019, with Trump as president and Pelosi as speaker. In 2019, Pelosi didn’t say anything before Trump started speaking. It’s unclear whether there was a miscommunication, but Pelosi insisted to reporters later that ""there was no snub. It went quickly, I guess."" In 2020, Pelosi did say part of the phrase — but as Tapper noted, it was just a part. She said: ""Members of Congress, the president of the United States."" Pelosi’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Tapper tweeted, ""Traditionally, the Speaker says: ‘Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States.’ (Tonight) Speaker Pelosi said, ‘Members of Congress, the President of the United States.’ "" Between 2007 and 2018, Pelosi and her successors used that language or something close, regardless of the party affiliations of the speaker and the president. In 2019, for unclear reasons, Pelosi didn’t speak before Trump started. This year, she did, but she left out the part about a ""high privilege and distinct honor.""

Donald Trump wrong again about prescription drug prices
","At the 2020 State of the Union, President Donald Trump zeroed in on prescription drug prices, arguing that his administration is ""taking on the big pharmaceutical companies.""  Among the evidence for that claim: a talking point the administration has been using since last April.  ""I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down,"" Trump said. We’ve examined this claim twice before, rating it Mostly False. But prescription drug prices are a major voter concern. So we wanted to take another look, in case things had changed. Experts told us the data remains essentially unchanged. Drug prices are still not going down. Last spring, Trump’s team pulled this claim from two sources: A 2018 report from the president’s  Council of Economic Advisers and data comparing the January 2019 Consumer Price Index for drugs to the January 2018 one. The CPI data suggested a decline in drug prices. But when we spoke to experts, they quickly debunked this position. For one thing, CPI data is imperfect — it shows list prices, rather than what consumers pay at the pharmacy counter. For another, it only covers drugs sold through retail, which accounts for about three-quarters of all prescriptions. That misses high-priced specialty drugs which are only sold through mail. Plus, other metrics showed that drug prices had in fact gone up, although by very little. Last April, for instance, the same CPI data indicated an increase — between April 2018 and April 2019, drug prices had increased by 0.3%. Data from the Kaiser Family Foundation also suggested an increase in total spending on drug prices that year, even if growth had slowed. Today, prices aren’t going up as fast as they were before, said Stacie Dusetzina, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University, who studies drug pricing. But they’re still going up.  ""That probably doesn’t provide the average person with much relief,"" she said. Meanwhile, there’s the question of individual list price increases. (List prices are defined as what’s charged before rebates — a number few people pay, but that dictates negotiations.) The CPI data paints with a broad brush, drug pricing analysts said, obscuring just how many drugs have seen and continue to see their prices go up.  In 2019, 4,311 prescription drugs experienced a price hike, with the average increase hovering around 21%, according to data compiled by Rx Savings Solutions, a consulting group. Meanwhile, 619 drugs had price dips. And already in 2020, 2,519 drugs have increased prices. The average hike so far this year is 6.9%. Meanwhile, 70 drugs have had their prices go down. Typically, branded drugs increase their prices early in the year, and generics do so later, said Michael Rea, the CEO of Rx Savings Solutions. When generics post their price increases, the 2020 average price hike will likely go up. ""As a broad brush stroke, the story remains the same.  Drug prices are going up, not down,"" Rea said. Trump said that in 2018, ""for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs went down."" Nothing has changed since our previous rulings on this statement. And the continued drug pricing trend suggests that prices may be stabilizing, but they are not coming down. And consumers are not experiencing that relief. We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('KHN/Politifact, ""Fact-checking Donald Trump\'s claim that drug prices are going down,"" May 22, 2019', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/may/22/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-claim-drug-prices-are-/'), ('Email interview with Michael Rea, CEO of Rx Savings Solutions, Jan. 21, 2020', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/05/donald-trump/donald-trump-said-drug-prices-are-down-his-state-u/

In State of the Union rebuttal, Texas Rep. overstates debt claim
","Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, took aim at the tax law that President Donald Trump signed into law in 2017, saying it has ballooned the debt. ""The president has exploded the debt by more than $3 trillion — all to give billion-dollar tax cuts to the wealthiest few,"" said Escobar, the lawmaker tapped to respond to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address in Spanish. (The Spanish version of the statement was, ""El presidente ha disparado la deuda por más de 3 billones de dólares, todo por recortarle miles de millones de dólares de impuestos a los más ricos."") Escobar is in the ballpark on the amount, but she’s exclusively blaming Trump when in fact her own party contributed to the passage of other laws that also increased the debt significantly. She also overstates that the impact of the tax cuts by singling out only ""the wealthiest few."" (Escobar’s office did not respond to an inquiry.) There are two ways of measuring the federal debt, and both get you to around $3 trillion. The debt held by the public rose by about $2.8 trillion between Trump’s inauguration in 2017 and the day before his State of the Union address. A broader measurement, gross federal debt, includes public debt plus the debt owed by one part of the government to another. That rose by a bit over $3.3 trillion over the same time period.  While Trump’s tax bill, which passed only with Republican votes, was one of the main reasons for the increase in debt, it wasn’t the only one. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscally conservative group, last year estimated that two other bills — the major federal spending bills that passed in February 2018 and August 2019 — jointly increased the debt by about as much as the tax bill did through 2019. Other bills added a smaller amount. The spending bill approved in 2018 passed with the support of most Senate Democrats and a bit over one-third of the House Democratic caucus. The spending bill approved in 2019 passed with the support of most Senate Democrats and the overwhelming majority of House Democrats.  Escobar’s statement does not acknowledge this broad Democratic support for bills that played a significant role in increasing the debt. The tax cut does provide tax breaks for the wealthiest few, and lots of other people, too. The cuts are projected to total $1.8 trillion over the next decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a think tank with a pro-business leaning. In 2018, about 80% of taxpayers had a tax cut due to the new law, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation. The savings skew toward high-income earners. The center said 21% of the total tax savings went to the highest-earning 1% of taxpayers in 2018, more than the total for the bottom 60%.  By 2025, that gap is projected to increase, with 25% of the tax savings going to the top 1%. The increases are larger for higher-income earners on a percentage basis as well — not just in raw dollars. In 2025, the top 1% are expected to see after-tax income grow by 2.9%, compared to 1.4% or less for the bottom 80% of income earners. Escobar said, ""The president has exploded the debt by more than $3 trillion — all to give billion-dollar tax cuts to the wealthiest few."" She is in the ballpark on the scale of the increase. However, while an independent analysis found that that tax law has added to the debt, it also found that a similar amount was added to the debt by two spending bills that Democrats largely supported prior to Trump’s signature. And while the tax cut does provide tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, it cuts taxes for lots of other people, too.

No evidence Iowa poll or caucus were ‘blocked’ by Democrats
","Just after the clock struck midnight — and there were still no official results from the Democratic caucuses in Iowa — a group supporting Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination accused the Democratic Party of a conspiracy. Organizers for Bernie 2020, which has 15,000 followers on Twitter, made the two-fold attack in this tweet, with a widely used and misspelled hashtag: ""They blocked the Iowa poll. They blocked the Iowa caucus. We are winning so hard the Democrats are shutting down the damn entire primary process. #PresidentSanders #IowaCaucas"" They blocked the Iowa poll.

But no evidence has surfaced to suggest the problems were the result of Democrats ""blocking"" efforts to poll or caucus — and certainly not within the first few chaos-filled hours after the caucusing ended. Results of the final CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll were scheduled to be released Feb. 2, two days before the caucuses.  The New York Times reported that the decision not to release the results was made after the campaign for Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said that an Iowa supporter received a poll phone call from an operator working for the Register’s polling operation, but that the name of the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., was not listed on the menu of options. One operator had apparently enlarged the font size on their computer screen, perhaps cutting off Buttigieg’s name from the list of options, according to two people interviewed by the Times.  Other news media, including Politico, also reported that Buttigieg’s campaign had raised the issue and that the font change apparently was the problem. The Register’s executive editor, Carol Hunter, explained the decision in a Feb. 1 article, saying ""it appears (Buttigieg’s) name was omitted in at least one interview in which the respondent was asked to name their preferred candidate,"" and that the omission ""could have compromised the results of the poll."" The second part of the statement undoubtedly refers to the unprecedented delay in the reporting of the results of Democratic caucuses.  By midday the following day (Feb. 4), the Iowa Democratic Party was saying it expected to release some results by 5 p.m. that day.  At that point, news organizations were reporting that the delays were caused by technical problems — both with an app and with a telephone system that had been set up as a backup for the electronic reporting of caucus tallies. People who called experienced long delays or couldn’t get through at all.  No evidence had surfaced that the delay was due to Democrats ""blocking"" the poll or caucus. We messaged Organizers for Bernie 2020, but didn’t get a reply.  A Sanders campaign spokeswoman told us the group has no relationship with the campaign. She had no comment on the claim we’re checking. A social media post said Democrats ""blocked the Iowa poll"" and ""blocked the Iowa caucus.""

Report about potential Iowa voter fraud is false
","One day before the Iowa caucuses, a conservative activist started making claims on Twitter about alleged voter fraud. ""It’s been revealed that EIGHT Iowa counties have more adults registered to vote than voting-aged adults living there,"" tweeted Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, Feb. 2. ""Don’t let voter fraud steal the 2020 election."" The tweet was flagged by VineSight, an organization that uses artificial intelligence to surface potential misinformation, and also appears on Facebook. The allegations from Kirk and another conservative organization aim to stir up concerns about voter fraud with a questionable methodology that leads to unsubstantiated conclusions. On Caucus Day, Iowa election officials issued public statements denouncing their numbers and the narrative. The current data released by Iowa election officials don’t support Kirk’s tweet. Kirk’s viral tweet makes the same claim as a Feb. 3 report published by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group. The Judicial Watch report says ""eight Iowa counties have more voter registrations than their eligible voting-age population."" Two of them, Johnson and Scott counties, are the locations of Davenport and Iowa City, respectively. The report was based on its analysis of data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. ""Dirty voting rolls can mean dirty elections and Iowa needs to undertake a serious effort to address its voting rolls,"" said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton in the news release. RELATED: We fact-checked the Democrats' closing push in Iowa before the caucuses Iowa officials refuted the report. A Feb. 3 news release from Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate said his office’s data ""shows this information to be false."" ""It’s unfortunate this organization continues to put out inaccurate data regarding voter registration, and it’s especially disconcerting they chose the day of the Iowa Caucus to do this,"" Pate said in the statement. ""My office has told the organization, and others who have made similar claims, that their data regarding Iowa is deeply flawed and their false claims erode voter confidence in elections."" We reached out to Kirk and Judicial Watch for comment, but neither has responded with one. It appears they were using old voter registration numbers.. We took a look at the most recent voter registration and population data from Iowa’s government and the Census Bureau. The numbers don’t support what Kirk said, and experts say comparing them is flawed. Among the counties identified by Judicial Watch, none have more active registered voters than adults.  For example, Scott County — the largest county included in the Judicial Watch story — has an estimated population of 131,961 people ages 18 and older, according to 2018 data from the Census’s American Community Survey. According to the Iowa secretary of state, there are 127,737 total voter registrations, 115,393 of which are active. Judicial Watch’s story looked at ""total registrations,"" which includes inactive voters. In Iowa, inactive voters are those that have not responded to notices from the state asking them to verify their registration and residence.  Only one county, Lyon, has more total registered voters than adults: 8,490 to 8,430. But that data is from 2018. The Iowa secretary of state’s office says 8,117 of voters in Lyon County are active. Either way, experts say comparing voter rolls and Census estimates isn’t an accurate measurement of registration rates. ""That’s an apples-to-oranges measure. They measure different things, at different times, with different types of levels of certainty,"" said Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor, in an email. ""And so it’s really bad science to claim that a disconnect between those two numbers means that there’s fraud."" Even if there were more registered voters than voting-age adults in some Iowa counties, experts told us it would not amount to voter fraud. ""For there to be voter fraud in connection to bloated voter rolls, you’d have to see people going to the polling places and see them voting in places of people who have moved or died,"" said Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California at Irvine. ""Not only would that be a difficult thing to do … you’d have to do this on a wide enough scale to sway an election without being able to verify how the people you’ve paid to do this have voted."" Voter fraud remains rare in American elections. A database maintained by the conservative Heritage Foundation has documented 17 confirmed instances of voter fraud in Iowa dating back to 2011. A tweet from Charlie Kirk claims that ""EIGHT Iowa counties have more adults registered to vote than voting-aged adults living there."" Voter registration data and a statement from Iowa’s secretary of state, as well as population estimates from the Census Bureau, refute that claim. And experts say comparing voter data to population estimates isn’t a good measure of registration rates in the first place.  Kirk’s tweet is inaccurate.

""Cory Booker and all these people couldn’t get any of the things that Bloomberg’s getting now,"" he said. ""I think it’s very unfair for the Democrats."" The DNC did make significant changes to its qualification criteria, raising the polling threshold while scrapping the individual donor requirement that candidates previously had to meet. The DNC’s recent shift does open the door for Bloomberg, who is self-funding his campaign and not taking donations, to participate in a debate for the first time.  But Trump’s claim glosses over important details. The new rules are different from what Booker asked for, and they don’t guarantee that Bloomberg will earn a spot on stage. For the DNC’s first two debates, candidates qualified by meeting one of two requirements: Polling at 1% in three national or early-state polls approved by the DNC, or getting donations from 65,000 unique donors, with at least 200 donors per state in 20 different states.  Over time, the requirements became more difficult to satisfy. At the September debate in Houston, the thresholds for polling and donors increased, and candidates were required to meet both benchmarks, not one or the other. By the time of the January debate in Des Moines, Iowa — the seventh on the DNC’s schedule — the polling threshold had risen to 5% in four national polls or 7% in two early-state polls, and the donor threshold bumped up to 225,000 donors, with 1,000 per state in 20 different states. Then came the February debates, the first contests scheduled to take place after voters and caucus-goers started making their picks for a nominee. For the Feb. 7 debate in New Hampshire, the DNC announced that while candidates could still qualify by meeting both the polling and donor thresholds set for the January debate, they could also qualify by earning one delegate to the national convention in the Iowa caucuses. (Bloomberg hasn’t campaigned in Iowa.) For the Feb. 19 debate in Las Vegas, the DNC has eliminated the donor requirement entirely. Candidates can either qualify by polling at 10% in four national polls or 12% in two early-state polls, or by getting one delegate in either the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary. (Bloomberg’s name won’t appear on the New Hampshire ballot.)    Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the DNC, told Politico that the early primary results will give a greater window into a candidate’s support than the donor tally. ""The donor threshold was appropriate for the opening stages of the race, when candidates were building their organizations, and there were no metrics available outside of polling to distinguish those making progress from those who weren’t,"" she said, according to Politico. Bloomberg’s refusal to take donations precluded him from participating in the DNC’s first seven debates, and because he is skipping the early states, he is unlikely to win the delegates in Iowa or New Hampshire that could put him in the ring for the Feb. 7 debate. But since candidates can qualify for the Feb. 19 debate simply by hitting the 10% polling mark, Bloomberg, who had called for the DNC to get rid of the donor requirement, now has a shot. That doesn’t mean he’ll make the stage. Currently, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have met the 10% polling threshold, according to Politico, which tracks public polling and has identified just one poll that has Bloomberg at 10%.  Watson told us Trump’s suggestion that the change was meant to help Bloomberg was ""false."" ""With the primary underway, we are assessing a candidate’s support through a significantly higher polling threshold and through actual election results,"" she said. ""We were always planning to do this, we signaled it many times, it is not designed to benefit any one candidate, and every candidate has an equal opportunity to qualify."" DNC Chairman Tom Perez did signal in November and December that he was considering doing away with the donor threshold for the early 2020 debates, according to reports. Still, other Democratic candidates have denounced the change, saying the DNC is catering to the billionaire.  The DNC didn’t change the rules to ensure good, diverse candidates could remain on the debate stage. They shouldn’t change the rules to let a billionaire on. Billionaires shouldn't be allowed to play by different rules—on the debate stage, in our democracy, or in our government.   A Sanders adviser said the change was evidence of a ""rigged system."" Warren tweeted that the DNC was letting Bloomberg ""play by different rules."" Entrepreneur Andrew Yang said the change was ""clearly tailor made to deliver (Bloomberg) to the debate stage."" In December, Booker led a push to lower qualification standards so that he, Julian Castro and others would stand a better chance of making the January and February debates. The New Jersey senator sent a letter, signed by several candidates, requesting that the DNC go back to requiring candidates to meet the polling threshold or the donor threshold, but not both. The DNC rejected Booker’s petition. ""Our qualification criteria is extremely low and reflects where we are in the race,"" the committee said in a statement, per Politico. ""Once voting starts in February, our criteria will reflect those contests, which is more than appropriate."" Similarly, Yang asked the DNC to commission more polls so candidates would have a higher likelihood of meeting the polling requirement.  Both of these changes would have made the path to the debates easier.  While the DNC has now scrapped the donor requirement and given candidates the option of qualifying through delegates or the polls, it has also doubled the polling threshold, a change that could potentially cut the number of candidates who qualify for the Nevada debate. For what it’s worth, the donor threshold was not usually the requirement keeping candidates from the debates. Bloomberg is the only candidate who failed to qualify for a debate specifically because of the donor requirement, according to Politico.  But it wasn’t nothing. Booker campaign staffers, for example, have described having to divert resources in order to satisfy the committee’s donor thresholds.   Oh, do you mean the day I literally Control+A+ Deleted a plan for a whole entire early game, early state persuasion strategy and used the money to buy email addresses instead? I don’t remember it. Blacked it out. Trump said, ""Cory Booker and all these people couldn’t get any of the things that Bloomberg’s getting now."" The DNC did adjust its qualification criteria, doubling the polling threshold and eliminating the donor requirement that had previously kept Bloomberg from debating. But the new rules are slightly different than what Booker asked for, and while they pave a path for Bloomberg to make his first debate, they don’t guarantee that he’ll earn a spot on stage. We rate Trump’s statement Half True.","[('Fox News on YouTube, ""Trump talks impeachment, 2020 Dems in exclusive Super Bowl interview,"" Feb. 2, 2020', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuO2ZQBN9gI'), ('Brian Stelter on Twitter, Feb. 2, 2020', 'No link'), ('ABC News, ""\'This Week\' Transcript 2-2-20: Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Andrew Yang,"" Feb. 2, 2020', 'https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1223973472554176514'), ('Vox, ""2020 Democratic candidates aren’t happy about new debate rules that seem to benefit Bloomberg,"" Feb. 1, 2020', 'No link'), ('ABC News, ""DNC scraps donor threshold for Nevada debate, opening door for Bloomberg to qualify,"" Feb. 1, 2020', 'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-20-mayor-pete-buttigieg-andrew-yang/story?id=68705106'), ('CBS News, ""Mike Bloomberg could qualify for Democratic debates after DNC rule change,"" Jan. 31, 2020', 'No link'), ('Slate, ""DNC Changes Debate Requirements to Favor All Candidates Named Michael Bloomberg,"" Jan. 31, 2020', 'https://www.vox.com/2020/2/1/21118038/2020-democratic-candidates-debate-rules-sanders-warren-biden-bloomberg'), ('Politico, ""DNC overhauls debate requirements, opening door for Bloomberg,"" Jan. 31, 2020', 'No link'), ('Politico, ""Public polling tracker,"" Jan. 31, 2020', 'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dnc-scraps-donor-threshold-nevada-debate-opening-door/story?id=68673875'), ('The New York Times, ""D.N.C.

Is Ukraine really still waiting on US aid? A small amount is still outstanding
","President Donald Trump’s hold on $400 million in aid for Ukraine is at the heart of the Senate impeachment trial. One of the Democratic House managers said Ukraine is still waiting on what the United States promised to send. ""The aid, although it did arrive, it took the work of some senators in this room who had to pass additional laws to make sure that the Ukrainians did not lose out on $35 million additional dollars,"" said Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., Jan. 29. ""Contrary to the president’s tweet that all of the aid arrived and that it arrived ahead of schedule, that is not true. All of the aid has not arrived."" As Demings said, Trump was wrong to say the aid was delivered ahead of time (see this report from FactCheck.org.) But we wanted to know whether Ukraine was still waiting on some amount of American support, even now. Demings has a point that not every dollar intended for Ukraine has been delivered.  The money was supposed to come in two pots: $250 million managed by the Pentagon for military aid and $141 million managed by the State Department. Trump’s hold on the aid last summer sent it off the usual path. The question about what federal dollars have not yet arrived relates to defense money. Here’s a refresher on the relevant events from 2019: June 18: The Defense Department announced plans to provide $250 million to Ukraine.  July: Trump ordered the Defense Department money, and $141 million in State Department aid, to be frozen ahead of his July 25, 2019, call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Emails show that Pentagon and OMB staff were scrambling to freeze the aid July 24-25, and paperwork to freeze the aid was in the works before the phone call. The New York Times reported that Trump first asked about freezing the aid in June.  Aug. 12: A whistleblower filed a complaint about Trump’s phone call and related actions.  Sept. 11: Under pressure, the White House released nearly $400 million of frozen U.S. aid to Ukraine. The White House’s reversal didn’t leave time to disburse all of the money before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. On Sept. 27, 2019, Trump signed a continuing appropriations bill to extend the $250 million in Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funds for another year. Most of the aid was obligated, the term the federal government uses to refer to money that the government has promised to spend. But a small portion wasn’t.  Mark Sandy, an official in the Office of Management Budget, said in his House deposition that roughly $35 million had not been obligated. Without the September extension, those funds would have expired, he said.  Some of those funds were intended for lethal equipment and radars, according to a Nov. 18 letter from four Democratic senators. About 93% of the $250 million designated for Ukraine by Congress has been obligated, said Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Col. Carla Gleason. That means about $17 million has not yet been obligated. Officials at the Office of Management and Budget have argued that it’s common for agencies to not fully spend their money by the end of the fiscal year, including for Ukraine aid. But the Government Accountability Office concluded that the office violated the federal Impoundment Control Act by withholding security assistance to Ukraine. ""It’s atypical that $35 million out of $250 million wouldn’t be spent by the end of the fiscal year, especially when (the Defense Department) certified that Ukraine was meeting the anti-corruption and transparency conditions outlined by Congress,"" said Seamus P. Daniels, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Demings said ""all of the aid has not arrived"" to Ukraine. The Defense Department told us that of the $250 million, about $17 million has not yet been obligated. That’s about 7%. When Trump unfroze the aid in September, that left little time until the end of the fiscal year that month. Congress passed a continuing appropriations bill so the funds could be carried over into 2020.  We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('Sen.

No, Nancy Pelosi’s net worth is not $196 million
","How rich is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.? A post making the rounds on social media offers a number that’s way off. The post, which features a picture of Pelosi gesturing, says: ""Annual salary: $193,400. Time in office: 28 years = $5,415,200. Net worth: $196,299,990. ‘Something is wrong with this picture’ -- Nancy Pelosi."" The meme’s point is that Pelosi is a modestly paid public servant who has nonetheless collected almost a fifth of a billion dollars in net worth, presumably by corrupt means. That interpretation, and the facts underlying it, are badly flawed. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  First, we’ll note that Pelosi’s current salary is higher than the meme says. As House speaker, Pelosi earns $223,500 a year, which is more than a rank-and-file member. But Pelosi hasn’t been earning that the whole time. When she first entered Congress in 1987, the full-year salary for a rank-and-file member was $89,500. It has risen in fits and starts since then. The meme’s bigger mistake, however, concerns her net worth. Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, has been a prominent businessman in real estate and venture capital for decades. So Pelosi hasn’t built a fortune from her government salary; most of it stems from her husband’s investments. Pelosi’s 2018 financial disclosure form shows the value of the assets she and her husband held at the time of the filing. Much of it appears to be from her husband’s business investments — a mix of real estate, partnerships, and blue-chip stock holdings, including Apple, Facebook, Visa, and Walt Disney Co.  The disclosure forms that all members of Congress must file lists their assets and liabilities, such as mortgages. Both categories are listed in broad ranges — a minimum and a maximum for each asset and liability in their portfolio — and they include the holdings of both the members of Congress as well as their spouses, if any. The maximum amount of the range for Pelosi was about $257 million in assets and $97 million in liabilities, which produces a maximum net worth of nearly $160 million. If you use the minimum in the reported range instead, the numbers are $54 million in assets and $20 million in liabilities, for a net worth of about $34 million. Either of those figure falls short of the $196 million in the meme. Averaging the maximum and minimum values as a back-of-the-envelope estimatse of the couple’s net worth produces a figure of $97 million, almost exactly half of the amount claimed in the meme. Another way of calculating Pelosi’s net worth would exceed $196 million.  Taking the lowest figure for liabilities and the highest figure for assets would subtract $20 million in liabilities from $257 million in assets, yielding a net worth of $237 million, which is higher than what the post says. The $196,299,990 figure in the meme dates back in conservative media to at least 2011, and it may have been an accurate reflection of Pelosi’s assets back then, without liabilities subtracted.  In February 2018, the congressional newspaper Roll Call published its most recent comparison of wealth disclosures by all members of Congress. Pelosi ranked as the 30th highest in wealth among both House members and senators, and 24th among House members alone. The post said Pelosi’s net worth is $196,299,990. That’s not accurate. Net worth is defined as assets minus liabilities. Congressional disclosure forms don’t provide a precise number, but the midpoint of produces a net worth for Pelosi of $97 million, which is a fraction of the number claimed in the meme. And the bulk of that has come from decades of investment activity by her husband — not because of corruption, as the meme implies. We rate the statement False. UPDATE: This article has been updated to reflect an additional scenario a reader suggested for estimating Pelosi’s net worth. The rating remains the same.","[('Meme on social media, spotted January 2020', 'https://www.facebook.com/RedPillLatina/photos/a.346278599603518/485038942394149/?type=3&theater'), ('Congressional Research Service, ""Salaries of Members of Congress: Recent Actions and Historical Tables,"" Jan. 13, 2020', 'No link'), ('Congressional Research Service, ""Congressional Salaries and Allowances: In Brief,"" April 11, 2018', 'https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-1011.pdf'), ('Roll Call, ""Ranking the Net Worth of the 115th,"" February 2018', 'No link'), ('Newsmax, ""Nancy Pelosi: Not Vacationing Like the 99 Percent,"" Dec. 29, 2011', 'https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/9c14ec69-c4e4-4bd8-8953-f73daa1640e4.pdf'), ('Snopes.com, ""Is a ‘Nancy Pelosi Crime Family’ Meme Accurate?""

Phil Scott’s claim about OneCare savings leaves out crucial context
","Clarification: This article has been revised from its original posting, after Gov. Phil Scott’s office reached out with additional information clarifying his statement as focusing on the Medicaid patient pool. This made the statement more accurate — we changed the ruling from mostly false to half true — but Scott still left out important context about overall costs associated with the OneCare program.  Gov. Phil Scott trumpeted the successes of Vermont’s health care reform efforts in his budget address last month. ""There are compelling stories to be told, and accountable care is showing more potential than any other health care reform I can remember,"" he said of OneCare Vermont, the state’s accountable care organization. ""In 2018, the providers the state paid through the ACO reduced the amount of money spent on healthcare services by $7.7 million,"" Scott said.  That savings figure jumped out at us. Our research on OneCare has found mixed results — and  an open admission from health care officials that the program has not yet created the savings they hope to achieve. Did we miss something? We asked Scott’s office for evidence and were referred to Ena Backus, director of health care reform for the state. She cited a Department of Vermont Health Access report on 2018 results for Medicaid patients. The $7.7 million in savings came from a small portion of Vermont’s nearly 200,000 Medicaid patients. About 42,000 of those Vermonters participate in OneCare, said Alicia Cooper, director of payment reform for the department. An even smaller portion of those patients see doctors who are paid a set fee each month, rather than payments for each procedure.  And it’s that subset of patients — those participating in OneCare whose doctors are paid a monthly fee — who cost the state $7.7 million less to care for than was originally expected, according to Backus.  ""That point that was made [by Scott] demonstrates that there was a change in provider behavior that we can measure,"" Backus said. Ethan Latour, a spokesperson for Scott, further clarified this point in an email to VTDigger. ""Those words, STATE and THROUGH THE ACO, explicitly describe the population,"" he wrote.  The problem? Scott referred in his speech to the ""amount of money spent on health care services.""  First off, his statement implies that there were savings in the entire health care system —  not just a small piece of it. Secondly, the $7.7 million wasn't returned to taxpayers. Under the new model, OneCare Vermont and hospitals keep the savings, as a reward for keeping patients healthy. OneCare actually spent more money than expected — about $1.5 million — on all medical care for state Medicaid patients in 2018, if you factor in the doctors who charged traditional fee per procedure rates.   Scott also didn’t mention that Vermont taxpayers paid OneCare $11.7 million for administrative costs that year.  OneCare collects money from Medicaid, Medicare and commercial insurance and then distributes it as a flat monthly payment for patient care. The administrative costs and incentives paid by the state cannot be entirely divorced from savings created by the program.  In addition, the governor cited savings in the Medicaid program but across the OneCare there were no net decreases in spending after administrative costs and incentives for providers.  Scott’s assessment led him to urge the Legislature to grant OneCare $5.7 million in additional Medicaid monies during the state budget adjustment process -- on the condition the accountable care organization applies for nonprofit status or meets equivalent transparency standards.  The real problem, Scott said, is OneCare’s ineffective public relations effort. In his budget speech, the governor invoked the state’s head regulator, Green Mountain Care Board chair Kevin Mullin, who in November urged the organization to tell a better story. ""I understand the ACO hasn’t done a great job explaining how they’re improving people’s health and reducing costs,"" Scott said. ""But there are compelling stories to be told."" Cooper, from the Department of Vermont Health Access, said Scott’s $7.7 million assertion may be one of those stories. ""At Medicaid, we‘re encouraged by these early results,"" she said. ""That’s enough to warrant continued testing of the model."" Scott said, ""in 2018, the providers the state paid through the ACO reduced the amount of money spent on healthcare services by $7.7 million."" That statement is partially accurate, but it does not account for the administrative costs or financial incentives paid by the state.  Politifact’s guidance describes ""half true"" as: ""The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" Scott’s claim ignores important facts about the cost of OneCare that would lead his audience to draw a different conclusion about the program's financial performance — even for the specific patient population that he references in his statement.  We rate this claim half true. ​","[('Interview with Ena Backus, director of Health Care Reform, Agency of Human Services. 24 Jan. 2020.\xa0', 'https://dvha.vermont.gov/administration/1final-vmng-2018-report-09-20-19.pdf'), ('Interview with Alicia Cooper, health care project director- payment reform, Department of Vermont Health Access. 24 Jan. 2020', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/03/phil-scott/phil-scott-said-onecare-vermont-saved-77-million-l/

These plushies do not ‘commemorate’ the 2019 Novel coronavirus strain
","A small stuffed toy is fanning the flames of another coronavirus conspiracy theory. A Jan. 27 Facebook post about an adorable plushie drew attention to an October 2019 gathering called Event 201. It was designed to help plan for a global pandemic by bringing together business, government, and public health leaders. ""Nobody has been able to explain why they gave out stuffed souvenir Coronavirus toys at #Event201 yet,"" the post reads. ""Almost like this is big fun — for them. Or maybe it’s to commemorate the virus that’ll make them a fortune on vaccines & other treatments we will be forced to buy — Thoughts?"" Underneath the post are three photos: a screen grab of Jan. 27 tweet from the Daily Mail showing images of the coronavirus under a microscope and two images showing small, stuffed toys shaped like orange suns with red rays and black eyes. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We noticed that there have also been many tweets speculating about Event 201’s pandemic simulation. So is it true that this plushie was distributed in commemoration of the coronavirus outbreak? Did the organizers of Event 201 have insider knowledge about this global health scare?  No. Here’s what we know.  The toy at the center of the controversy is supposed to be a microbe. Two months before the outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was detected in Wuhan, China, the Event 201 scenario — which was organized by John Hopkins Center for Health Security World Economic Forum and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation —""simulated a novel zoonotic coronavirus transmitted from bats to pigs to people that eventually becomes efficiently transmissible from person to person, leading to a severe pandemic,"" according to the Event 201 website.  The fictionalized scenario, which was planned in part because there have been two worldwide outbreaks of coronaviruses in the last 20 years, also included 65 million related deaths in 18 months from the pretend coronavirus. Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security on Oct. 16, 2019, tweeted a picture of the stuffed microbe as part of its Event 201 registration drive: ""Have you registered for the #Event201 virtual pandemic exercise yet?"" the tweet read. ""See the story of #Event201 play out in real-time and answer tough questions that could arise in a severe pandemic. Register today and be entered to win one of our Event201 giant microbes!""  Have you registered for the #Event201 virtual pandemic exercise yet? See the story of #Event201 play out in real-time and answer tough questions that could arise in a severe pandemic. Register today and be entered to win one of our Event201 giant microbes! https://t.co/phz7Qc0LQL pic.twitter.com/fJZdjH1fVi On Jan. 24, 2020, the John Hopkins Center for Health Security released a statement clarifying that they had not been predicting the current coronavirus outbreak: ""To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction."" A World Economic Forum article stated that the Event 201 simulation of a pandemic was meant to ""bring together public and private leaders to inform multi-stakeholder cooperation for pandemic preparedness and response."" The article argues there needs to be pandemic simulations like these to prepare for the average of 200 epidemics that take place annually. Johns Hopkins has hosted other simulations in recent years, including Dark Winter in 2001, Atlantic Storm in 2005, and Clade X in 2018. A Facebook post says that Event 201 in October 2019 gave out stuffed coronavirus plushies to commemorate a coronavirus outbreak that didn’t start until December 2019. Yes, these plushies are meant to represent coronavirus microbes. They were given out in October — two months before the first cases of the current 2019 coronavirus outbreak appeared — but this was not because the event’s organizers had predicted the Novel Coronavirus to come. They were distributed as part of the registration for a New York event that was centered on preparing for a new coronavirus pandemic because of the history of outbreaks. These plushies were not intended to commemorate the toll that outbreak would bring. Context is everything.

Earnings at the bottom rising faster than at the top? The mixed data behind Trump’s claim
","One of President Donald Trump’s central promises was to produce a rising economy that lifts all boats. At a rally in Wildwood, N.J., he touted record low unemployment rates, especially for African Americans and Hispanics. His policies of tax cuts and rolling back regulations, he said, had been particularly good for those making the least. ""This is a blue-collar boom,"" Trump said Jan. 28. ""Earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10%."" The Bureau of Labor Statistics has the numbers behind Trump’s statement. There’s data for each quarter and each year. The quarterly numbers back Trump up, but the yearly numbers are more reliable — they capture seasonal employment and have a lower standard error. Looking at the changes from year to year, earnings for the lowest 10% grew faster in only one year, 2018. Here’s how that looks:   So Trump is right for only one out of the three years of his presidency. We also looked at the change between 2016, the year before Trump took office, and 2019. Viewed that way, the numbers support Trump’s statement. Between 2016 and 2019, the low-wage earners saw a 14.6% rise, compared with 13.5% for the top earners. This data has limitations. The earnings data misses income from a second part-time job that many low-wage earners rely on. But more significant are the dollars it misses on the high end. It doesn’t count the self-employed at all –– about 10% of the workforce –– which in the higher income group includes lawyers, engineers, financial advisers and other lucrative professions.  ""The earnings growth in that group could be very high, because that’s where we’ve seen some of the highest income growth over the past 30 years,"" said Erica Groshen, the former head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Plus, this survey doesn’t count earnings over $150,000. Someone making $250,000 would be entered as earning $149,999. That makes the high-end number in the data artificially low. This measure is not well suited to the comparison at the extremes that Trump made. Trump pushed for the tax cuts and signed spending bills that spurred growth (and rising deficits) so he can take some credit for a steady economy.The growth has led employers to boost wages to attract and keep workers.  But Trump has not supported raising the minimum wage, and that’s also a plausible driving factor. The federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour hasn’t changed since 2009, but 29 states have increased it on their own, including very large states such as New York and California. ""The minimum wage absolutely could be at play,"" said economist Elise Gould with the Economic Policy Institute, a group focused on gains for low and middle income workers. ""In states that raised the minimum wage, lower income wages rose faster than in those that didn’t."" Between 2010 and 2018, in states that raised the minimum wage faster than inflation, the bottom 10% of workers saw their wages go up nearly 10%. For states that didn’t act, wages rose too, but by less than 6%. So tax and regulation cuts are only part of the story. Deficit spending and hikes in the minimum wage also played a role. Trump said that ""earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10%."" Earnings for the bottom 10% seem to be rising faster, but not by much, and there are different ways to crunch the data.  Also, the weekly earnings measure misses a lot of income at the high end and produces an artificially low estimate for the top 10%. It is a poor measure for the comparison Trump made. The claim is partially accurate but lacks important context. We rate this claim Half True.","[('Donald Trump, Rally in Wildwood, N.J., Jan. 28, 2019', 'https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-kag-rally-wildwood-new-jersey-january-28-2020'), ('U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Quartiles and selected deciles of usual weekly earnings, Jan. 17, 2020', 'No link'), ('Wall Street Journal, Rank-and-File Workers Get Bigger Raises, Dec. 27, 2019', 'https://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpswktab5.htm'), ('USA Today, What are the 25 lowest paying jobs in the US?

"['New Jersey', 'Poverty', 'Barbara Buono']","
Sen. Barbara Buono says nation’s poverty rate is at its highest level since 1964
","
Fail to raise New Jersey’s minimum wage, and state legislators would be surrendering in the ""war on poverty"" launched by President Lyndon Johnson nearly 50 years ago, according to state Sen. Barbara Buono.

Urging her colleagues to support the wage hike, Buono (D-Middlesex) claimed on the Senate floor Thursday that poverty in America is at its highest level since 1964. With Buono’s support, the Senate passed a bill to raise the minimum wage to $8.50 per hour and implement annual cost-of-living increases.

""Across our nation, the number of Americans living at or below the poverty line is at its highest level since President Johnson gave his State of the Union address in 1964, when he launched a war on poverty and he promised the nation that he would not rest until that war was won,"" Buono said. ""Well today, in this very moment, if we fail to act, we must acknowledge that we surrendered.""

It’s accurate to say the latest official poverty rate represents one of the highest levels since 1964, but Buono is wrong to call it the ""highest level."" During the past five decades, there have been a few years when the rate was the same or higher than the most current estimate.

The official poverty rate stands at 15 percent of the U.S. population in 2011, or about 46.2 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the official federal source of poverty statistics. The bureau released that estimate in September.

Individuals and families are considered ""in poverty"" if their total income falls below certain thresholds. For example, a family of five, including two children under 18 years old, would be considered in poverty if its income was less than $27,517, according to the bureau.

The 2011 rate marks a slight reduction from the official poverty rate in 2010, when 15.1 percent, or about 46.3 million people, were living in poverty, according to the bureau. But the 2011 figures were not statistically different from those in 2010, the bureau said.

Those recent estimates were higher than in most other years since 1964 -- when the official poverty rate was 19 percent -- but not every year.

The official poverty rates were 15.1 percent in 1993; 15.2 percent in 1983; 15 percent in 1982; and 17.3 percent in 1965. So, the official poverty rates recorded in those four years were the same or higher than the levels seen in 2010 and 2011.

A spokeswoman for Buono did not respond to three e-mails outlining our findings.

It’s also worth noting that, during the past few decades, concerns have been raised about the methodology behind the official poverty rate, leading government officials to create an alternative measurement called the Supplemental Poverty Measure, or SPM.

Based on the SPM, 16.1 percent of the population, or nearly 49.7 million people, were living in poverty last year, according to the bureau. The SPM is not intended to replace the official estimate, but instead provide ""further understanding of economic conditions and trends,"" the bureau said.

Our ruling

During a debate over raising the state’s minimum wage, Buono claimed ""the number of Americans living at or below the poverty line is at its highest level since"" 1964.

The latest official poverty rate -- 15 percent in 2011 -- does represent one of the highest levels since 1964, but there have been a few years in the past five decades when the rate was the same or higher than the most current estimate.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

Walker says he unveiled legislative agenda in Wisconsin, not California
","
When Gov. Scott Walker hit the road for a ""conversation"" with Wisconsinites after Thanksgiving, it followed criticism that he had unveiled major legislative plans in a California speech before clueing in his home state.

Given the 18-month uproar over Walker’s surprise move to sharply curtail public-sector unions in 2011, the particulars of his rollout process for big policy changes are a sensitive topic.

The Appleton Post-Crescent wondered if Walker was more comfortable dishing to a friendly conservative audience than his own state’s residents. The Green Bay Press-Gazette headlined a story, ""Walker’s California speech doesn’t play well at home."" Democratic legislative leaders pounced.

This was the first question Wisconsin Public Radio host Joy Cardin read to Walker on Nov. 26, 2012, from ""Jerry on Facebook"":

""I would think the new plans for Wisconsin that the governor unveiled would be better announced in Wisconsin. Why did he unveil them in California?""

Walker responded: ""Well, I didn’t. I actually announced the ideas on Nov. 8 in La Crosse at the small business summit.""

Walker said his remarks as part of a question-and-answer session following his Nov. 16, 2012, address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum covered ""essentially the same thing"" he said in La Crosse.

""I literally had talked about it first and foremost in great detail at the small business summit in La Crosse, which had a great crowd, almost 400 to 500 small business leaders from across the state of Wisconsin. So I’ve talked about it before. I just can’t make the press cover it.""

Walker also told Cardin he talked publicly in front of reporters about his agenda at a Republican Senate caucus meeting on Nov. 8, the day of the La Crosse speech.

Did the guv give the scoop to his out-of-state audience?

To be sure, Walker set his own bar high, saying he said ""essentially the same thing"" and in ""great detail"" in Wisconsin as he did in California.

We watched complete video from both speeches and reviewed media coverage of them. We also reviewed coverage of the caucus appearance, and watched it on video. Here’s what we found on the four main themes Walker touched on in California regarding plans for the final two years of his first term.

Tax cuts

Walker has long expressed his support for an income-tax rate cut, dating to the 2010 gubernatorial election. He did not propose it in his first budget. He also said during the 2012 recall race that he favored a broad income tax cut.

In the La Crosse speech, Walker told business people that he’d ""love"" to reduce the income tax burden in the state in his next budget, and strongly hinted he meant the individual income tax rate. Local media reported the tax remarks, with the La Crosse Tribune noting that Walker ""expects Democratic support for measures including tax cuts...""

In California, Walker repeated his goal, but in more certain terms, vowing to ""put in place"" income-tax reform in his next two years.

Most notably from a news standpoint, Walker added the ear-catching description of the income tax cut proposal as ""massive"" and ""aggressive.""

And in California, Walker added what appears to be a new element: a potential property tax cut.

He said his administration was going to continue to lower property taxes. His first budget, for 2011-’13, featured a virtual freeze on property taxes, and they actually fell for owners of a median-valued home.

We found no references to a property tax cut proposal in his appearances before the California trip.

(A footnote on taxes: Eleven days after the California speech, Walker raised the possibility of cutting just the income tax or the property tax, not both.)

Education funding

Walker told the Senate caucus that his next budget might link state aid to public schools to student performance and school growth, the Associated Press reported. He made the same remarks on Nov. 12, 2012, on a phone call to the Assembly GOP caucus. Both instances were public and received media attention.

He repeated the remarks in California, saying, as he did to the Senate caucus, that he would apply the principle to kindergarten-12th grade schools, technical colleges and the University of Wisconsin system.

School voucher program

In California, Walker said he’d like to expand Wisconsin’s voucher program for private schools to more students over the next two years.

He didn’t say anything about vouchers in the La Crosse speech or at the caucus, based on news coverage and video from the speech.

This scenario rings a bell.

In 2011, Walker announced in a Washington, D.C., speech that he wanted expansion beyond students in Milwaukee, possibly to Racine and Beloit and Green Bay. That was during the 2011-’13 budget debate; ultimately, lawmakers added only Racine.

Walker’s comments in California seemed to suggest he supports a statewide voucher program: ""Every child -- no matter what ZIP code they come from, no matter what their parents' background -- every child in my state and in this country should have the opportunity to have access to world-class education.""

Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie told us Walker’s supportive comments should not be read to suggest the governor will include such a proposal in his 2013-’15 budget, expected in February.

That, too, sounds familiar: In 2011, Walker did not include the expansion beyond Milwaukee in his 2011-’13 budget, but GOP lawmakers put it in later after Walker signalled his support.

Government regulation of business

Walker spoke extensively in the La Crosse speech about eliminating rules that fail a common-sense test, as he did in California.

So, that’s what the record shows on the key themes.

On two -- trimming regulation and holding schools accountable -- Walker clearly announced his intentions in Wisconsin first. And he did so in great detail. On income tax cuts, he strongly hinted at his intentions in the Wisconsin appearances, but his souped-up comments about the size and certainty of the cuts were first made in California.

The property tax cut he mentioned in California was new.

And on school vouchers, Walker’s talk of expansion may not be surprising,  but he put it in play as a top legislative priority during his California speech -- not earlier in Wisconsin.

Our rating

Walker said he outlined his agenda in Wisconsin first, in great detail, before talking about ""essentially the same thing"" at the Reagan Library.

There’s an element of truth here. Walker did roll out some of the issues in Wisconsin, but he left out major items he later mentioned in California, on property tax cuts and an unspecified expansion of the school voucher program.

In addition, Walker spoke with much greater clarity and revealed more about his ""massive"" income tax plans out west than he did back home.

"['New Jersey', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'John Wisniewski']","
Democratic leader offers cautionary tale for Gov. Chris Christie: President George H. W. Bush lost re-election bid after having 90 percent approval rating in January 1992
","
If Gov. Chris Christie is anything like President George H. W. Bush, the governor could go from soaring in public opinion polls to losing at the voting booth next year.

That’s at least what New Jersey Democratic Party Chairman John Wisniewski suggested last week in response to polls showing rising support for the Republican governor. Christie has announced plans to seek re-election, and Wisniewski has been mentioned as a possible challenger.

""No one’s unbeatable,"" Wisniewski, a state assemblyman from Middlesex County, said in a Nov. 27 interview on NJToday.

Of Christie’s rising poll numbers, Wisniewski later added: ""It’s interesting. For him, it’s great news, but it’s not dispositive on the outcome of the election at any means.

""I mean, we all remember George Bush. January of 1992, (he) probably had a 90 percent or even higher approval rating after the first Gulf War, and in late November of 1992, we were calling Bill Clinton president-elect.""

But the Democratic leader’s history lesson is off.

Soon after the Gulf War ended in February 1991, Bush had an approval rating hovering around 90 percent. However, by January 1992, the 41st president’s approval rating had dropped to less than 50 percent.

Alicia D’Alessandro, a spokeswoman for Wisniewski, told us the party chairman meant to reference March 1991, when a Washington Post/ABC News poll gave Bush a 90 percent approval rating.

""It seems that Chairman Wisniewski incorrectly identified the date of the poll, which can happen when you're discussing events from about two decades ago,"" D’Alessandro said in an e-mail. ""Still, the chairman was making a point about poll numbers representing a snapshot in time, and that point still stands.""

To evaluate Wisniewski’s claim, we turned to presidential approval data from Gallup, which is considered one of the leading assessments of presidential performance. Gallup has measured presidential job approval ratings since Franklin D. Roosevelt was commander-in-chief.

As the Gulf War ended, Bush garnered an approval rating of 89 percent, according to a Gallup poll conducted in late February and early March of 1991. That figure would turn out to be the highest approval rating of Bush’s presidency, as measured by Gallup.

Then, driven in part by a staggering economy, Bush’s numbers nose-dived. The president’s approval rating gradually went down throughout the rest of 1991 before landing at 46 percent in January 1992, according to Gallup.

Other polls around the same time turned up similar results for the president. A Washington Post/ABC News poll gave Bush a 45 percent approval rating, and in a New York Times/CBS News Poll, 43 percent said they approved of his performance as president.

A few weeks before losing his re-election bid to Clinton, Bush’s approval rating stood at 34 percent, according to Gallup.

While Bush’s approval ratings showed a sharp drop in support, the latest poll numbers for Christie demonstrate an upswing at a time when the governor has been widely praised for his leadership during Hurricane Sandy.

A Quinnipiac University poll released on Tuesday put Christie's approval rating at 72 percent, marking a 16-point increase over his 56 percent approval rating in a Quinnipiac poll from October.

In a poll released Tuesday by Rutgers University’s Eagleton Institute of Politics, Christie was viewed favorably by 67 percent of respondents, compared to 48 percent in a Rutgers-Eagleton poll released in early October. 
""The realities of governing – including the budget and a host of other contentious issues – are likely to cool the governor’s red-hot numbers over time,"" David Redlawsk, director of the Rutgers-Eagleton Poll and a political science professor, said in a news release.

Our ruling

Comparing Christie with the 41st president, Wisniewski claimed in a TV interview that in January 1992, Bush ""probably had a 90 percent or even higher approval rating after the first Gulf War."" 
The assemblyman is correct that Bush once had near-unanimous support, but he's wrong about the timing. The president's approval rating was around 90 percent in March 1991, but by January 1992, it had fallen below 50 percent.

We rate the statement Mostly False.

Association of Mature American Citizens says under Affordable Care Act, 16,000 IRS agents will pry into private medical records
","
One of the main themes that drives the opposition to President Obama’s health-care overhaul is the idea of the federal government muscling its way into individuals’ private health decisions.

One of the favored images in those arguments is the specter of 16,000 newly hired agents from the Internal Revenue Service sweeping in to enforce the law’s rules and regulations.

It was evoked in a letter one of our readers received last month from Daniel C. Weber, president and founder of the Association of Mature American Citizens, which calls itself ""the conservative alternative to the AARP."" Our reader forwarded the letter to us.

In his letter, Weber called for signatures on a petition to ""defund"" the Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare, and asked recipients to pay for a membership in his group ($16 per year, with discounts for multi-year memberships.)

Among other things, Weber claimed that if the law is fully implemented, the federal government will hire 16,000 new IRS agents who ""will begin prying into our private medical records, eyeing each and every one of our treatments and prescriptions for ‘violations.’ ""  

We left e-mail and telephone messages for Weber with his organization, but weren’t able to reach him for comment.

Politifact reporters and others around the country have been playing Whac-a-Mole with variations of this claim for a while now. PolitiFact National gave then-Illinois Republican U.S. Rep. (and later to be U.S. Sen.) Mark Kirk a Mostly Falseruling for saying in a March 21, 2010, speech on the House floor that the IRS would have to hire 16,000 employees ""to audit the American people and impose the new taxes and mandates of the bill.""

PolitiFact National traced the origin of that number to a report from the Congressional Budget Office that said that, based on what it called incomplete estimates, the new law could wind up costing the IRS between $5 billion and $10 billion over the next 10 years.

Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee took the high end of that incomplete estimate, $10 billion, divided it by the average IRS employee’s salary and came up with 16,500 additional ""examiners, auditors and other employees.""  But the committee also noted it was ""impossible to know"" the exact number of new hires.

PolitiFact rated the claim Mostly False because it incorrectly attributed the 16,500-employee figure directly to the CBO, took only the high end of an incomplete estimate and assumed all the money would go to staff and not for other costs, such as office overhead.

A year later, U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga, added some new touches to the claim. In a March 28, 2011, letter he sent to a constituent, the 16,500 IRS employees became 16,500 agents enforcing the law. PolitiFact Georgia ruled his claim False.

Despite two years of similar debunkings, the 16,000-agent claim not only survives, it’s morphing, as evidenced by Weber’s letter. In addition to repeating the number, he says the new agents will be investigating citizens’ private medical records.

Is that true? In short, no. Here are the facts.

The law requires individuals who don’t have health insurance to pay a financial penalty. The IRS envisions taxpayers getting a form from their insurance provider that certifies they have coverage, and then attaching that form to their federal tax return.

If the taxpayer doesn’t have coverage, the IRS will be responsible for collecting any penalties.

How that collection is to be enforced is unclear because the law strips the agency of the ability to impose criminal and civil penalties, such as liens on property.


As far as Weber’s claim that the IRS would be investigating taxpayer’s medical procedures, Commissioner Douglas H. Shulman has said  the agency’s only interest is in the yes-or-no question of whether a taxpayer has coverage, not what procedures, if any, it covered.

""We expect to get a simple form that we won’t look behind that says this person has acceptable health coverage,"" Shulman told a House Ways and Means subcommittee on March 25, 2010. ""There are not going to be any discussions about health coverage with an IRS employee.""

""The role of the IRS is going to be, again, the tax portions of this,"" he said, ""not the health portions of this.""

 Our Ruling 
Dan Weber, president of the Association of Mature American Citizens, said in a widely circulated letter that under the federal health overhaul, 16,000 new IRS agents will be   ""prying into our private medical records.""

Weber’s letter recycled arguments that have been repeatedly found to be untrue -- and added a new and equally untrue element.

Conservative group says legislative proposal would lift mothers and fathers from future Texas birth certificates
","
The leader of a conservative group launched this year warns that legislation supported by gay rights advocates would amend every future birth certificate.

In a Nov. 19, 2012, interview with Austin’s KTBC-TV, Channel 7, Jonathan Saenz, president of Texas Values, which says it seeks to preserve and advance a culture of family values, said he doesn’t expect the measure to pass into law.  But ""if this change is made in the law,"" Saenz said, ""it affects everyone’s birth certificates. That means the birth certificates the way they are now, the forms, would not say ‘mother’ and ‘father.’""

Mom and Dad absent from birth certificates? 
Asked the basis of his claim, Saenz told us by email the proposal filed by Rep. Rafael Anchia, D-Dallas, for consideration by the 2013 Legislature strips references to a mother and father from supplemental birth certificates, which describes certificates mostly issued in adoption cases.

Saenz said in the TV interview: ""So if you wanted them, any parent wants them,"" meaning birth certificates, ""they’re not going to have ‘mother’ and ‘father’ on there. So this isn’t just about the homosexual lobby wanting their rights. It’s partly about that issue, but this change in the law would impact everyone’s birth certificates.""

Chuck Smith, executive director of Equality Texas, which says it lobbies for the elimination of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression, said in an email and online post that partly because Anchia’s House Bill 201 only applies to birth certificates issued in adoption cases, Saenz’s claim is incorrect, a critique that Anchia echoed by telephone. Smith initially brought Saenz’s claim to our attention.

Nearly 30,000 so-called ""supplemental"" birth certificates were filed by the state from September 2011 through August 2012, according to Christine Mann, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, which filed nearly 388,000 regular birth certificates, the kind issued after babies are born, in the period. Both types, once issued, look the same, she said by email.

Anchia’s proposal would replace a provision in the Texas Health and Safety Code saying that on a supplemental birth certificate, one parent must be a female, named as the mother, and the other a male, named as the father. The law would say instead that the ""supplementary birth certificate of an adopted child must be in the names of both adoptive parents,"" not specifying genders. The measure would take effect in September 2013. 
The way the law now works for same-sex couples is that one adoptive parent must choose to be designated as the father, in the case of a male couple, or the mother, in the case of a female couple, and the other parent is not listed on the resulting birth certificate, according to information posted online by State Health Services. By email, Mann confirmed that the 1997 Legislature put the gender-specific requirement in place of the previous law requiring only that parents be listed.

So, would mother and father fade from Texas birth certificates in general?

We noticed that the fiscal note for a similar proposal offered by Anchia in the 2011 session quotes State Health Services as saying relevant forms would be modified to show ""Parent 1"" and ""Parent 2."" In contrast, the ""Certificate of Adoption"" form now filled out to obtain a supplemental birth certificate has spaces for applicants to designate the child’s mother and father.

By phone, two lawyers with expertise in adoption cases told us they do not read Anchia’s proposal as Saenz does.

Michael Lackmeyer of Killeen said the proposal solely relates to birth certificates in adoption cases, not  the vast majority issued after babies are born. Also, he said, he believes the state could keep the existing application for supplemental certificates, perhaps amended with instructions stating the adopting mother need not be a female nor the father a male.

""I don’t really think it’s going to do quite what the opposition thinks it’s going to do,"" Lackmeyer said.

Jeff Barnett of Austin agreed, saying nothing in the proposal should lead to certificates issued after birth losing ""mother"" and ""father"" designations. All the proposal does is remove the hurdle that one adopting parent be male and the other female, Barnett said.

In contrast, Mann of State Health Services offered an uncertain analysis, saying by email that while the proposal may not appear to affect all certificates, that remains a possibility.

If the ""modification is made to only supplementary birth records, it may have the effect of identifying adopted persons,"" Mann wrote. ""If you modify just the supplementary birth records of adopted persons by including only gender-neutral references to the parents (e.g. ‘parent 1’ and ‘parent 2’) and leave all other birth records with the ‘mother’ and ‘father’ references, that gender neutral reference/record distinguishes adopted person’s records and thus identifies them, which under current state law, is prohibited. As a result,"" she said, ""we would have to have a consistent reference on all birth certificates going forward so as to not bring attention to those which are for adopted persons.""

We had asked Mann if Anchia's proposal would result in ""mother"" and ""father"" entries going away from all certificates. 
She replied: ""The answer may be no if we can find a way to add ‘or parent’ ‘or co-parent’ or some other additional category along with ‘mother’ and ‘father’ to provide the gender-neutral option provided by the (legislation) on all certificates such as ‘Mother or Parent 1’ and ‘Father or Parent 2.’ This may be an issue of space on the certificates, so it’s unclear at this point if this is an option.""

Mann also said the agency ""would need to modify more than 20 forms which currently reflect the names of the mother and father to show parent and co-parent to comply with this bill. These modifications would result in programming changes which must be made to the Texas Electronic Registrar and Remote Issuance systems, as well as the Texas.gov web portal. These changes would affect all birth certificates yet to be issued. It would not affect birth certificates already issued.""

Finally, we ran her comments by Saenz, Smith and the outside lawyers. Saenz said they uphold his claim. Smith stressed that no form changes are required by Anchia’s proposal.

Lackmeyer said by email that ""even though the changes address only supplemental"" birth certificates, ""who knows what any state agency will do to the entire system to implement that minor change?"" 
By email, Barnett said the proposal still does not mandate the removal of ""mother"" and ""father"" from certificates.

Our ruling

The leader of Texas Values says a proposed change in law would strip ""mother"" and ""father"" from Texas birth certificates.

The proposal would eliminate a requirement that adoptive couples seeking a birth certificate list a male father and female mother. But nothing in the proposal explicitly removes mother and father entries on certificates and it seems reasonable to us that any needed tweaks could be made without Moms and Dads vanishing from them. 
Then again, the state agency spokeswoman was uncertain about the proposal's effect, which sways us to say that Saenz's claim has an element of truth. We rate it Mostly False.","[('\nEmails (excerpted), Chuck Smith, executive director, Equality Texas, Nov. 20, 2012 through Nov. 27, 2012\n\nEmails (excerpted), responses to PolitiFact Texas, Jonathan Saenz, president, Texas Values, Nov. 26 through Nov. 28, 2012\n\nTelephone interview, Rafael Anchia, Dallas, Nov. 26, 2012\n\nFiscal note to House Bill 415, 2011 Texas Legislature (accessed Nov. 26, 2012)\n\nTelephone interview, Michael Lackmeyer, attorney, Killeen, Nov. 27, 2012\n\nTelephone interview, Jeff Barnett, attorney, Austin, Nov. 27, 2012\n\nEmails (excerpted), responses to PolitiFact Texas, Christine Mann, assistant press officer, Texas Department of State Health Services, Nov. 26 through Nov. 28, 2012', 'https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1ZQRX8AHXkkG7xUfxaxvysIHJGNGpyJa-sSwlV9WFVF0')]",/factchecks/2012/nov/30/texas-values/conservative-group-says-legislative-proposal-would/
"['Oregon', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'John  Kitzhaber']","
Does the state pick up 70 percent of the K-12 tab?
","
A few weeks back, Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber offered his thoughts on several subjects during an address to the Oregon School Boards Association -- everything from PERS and No Child Left Behind to third-grade reading levels and his upcoming budget.

Before wrapping up his speech, he said he wanted to touch on one more item: The ""disconnect"" between ""what is bargained for at the local level and the actual fiscal condition of the state.""

The state, he said, has 197 school districts but nearly 350 local bargaining units and contracts. ""These one- to three-year contracts that are bargained at the local level in many cases are disconnected from the revenue that's available in the state's school fund -- yet the state is required to come in on the back end and pick up 70 percent of the cost.""

There’s a fair point to be made there -- the state picks up part of the tab for spending that it doesn't have any hand in negotiating. Yet, the assertion that the state picks up 70 percent of what school districts spend caught us off guard.

We did a quick check of the math from 2009-10 (that’s the most recent year that we have data available from the federal government) and found that total spending by K-12 school districts and education service districts was about $5.5 billion. The total state contribution to K-12 education that year was $2.95 billion. With a little division, you find that the state really only covered 53.4 percent of the bill -- not the 70 percent Kitzhaber referenced.

That’s a ways off, so we got in touch with Amy Wojcicki, the governor’s spokeswoman, to see what was up. The governor, she said in an e-mail, was referring to ""funding for schools that comes through the State School Fund. This includes local revenues (primarily property taxes) and state funding. The state funding equals about two-thirds of the State School Fund.""  

If you go back to the 2009-10 figures, you can tease apart three pots of money in the total $5.5 billion going to K-12 education. About $4.4 billion comes from Oregon -- $2.95 billion from the state and $1.5 billion from local property taxes and whatnot. Another $1 billion or so comes from the federal government in various forms. To get that 70 percent figure, the governor looked at just the money originating in Oregon: $2.95 billion is about 66 percent of $4.4 billion. (He then rounded up.) 
But looking at the numbers that way didn’t make much sense to us. Why pretend that $1 billion doesn’t exist?

Ben Cannon, the governor’s education adviser, laid out their reasoning for us. Basically, he said, the federal funding doesn’t take into account any of the local bargaining -- so it makes sense to look at just the funding that’s coming in at the state or local level.

Even that explanation felt a little thin to us, though, because here’s the thing: The state and local funding levels aren’t connected to local bargaining either.

Let’s say, for instance, that Portland Public Schools suddenly decided all teachers should receive $1 million a year in pay and benefits. Well, that doesn’t mean the state has to adjust funding to meet that additional cost or, for that matter, that property taxes would go up. Portland Public might put up a fight for it -- but ultimately the state can say ""no.""

While that’s true, Cannon said, when school budgets grow, most of the pressure gets put on the state to step up. The reason for that, he said, is that the local taxes and the federal contributions are fairly fixed, so when the budgets are built, there’s essentially a gap between what schools need and what they’re getting through those first two sources. ""The state's budget is built to fill that extra gap,"" Cannon said. ""Do we have to fill it? No. But the expectation is the state will.

The governor has said, on at least two occasions, ""the state is required to come in on the back end and pick up 70 percent of the cost"" of K-12 schools in Oregon. That’s really only the case if you don’t include federal funds in the entire K-12 budget. Moreover, the state isn’t ""required"" to fund to any level. Historically, the state has stepped up to fill that ""gap,"" as Cannon describes it, but there’s no commitment that it must.

This statement contains an element of truth but ignores some critical facts. We rate it Mostly False.","[('\nGov.

"['Economy', 'Health Care', 'Jobs', 'Workers', 'Florida', 'Pam Bondi']","
Pam Bondi said national studies show businesses are already raising prices and cutting jobs because of the health care law
","
Some Florida public officials, including Gov. Rick Scott, have softened their tone on the federal health care law since the U.S. Supreme Court declared it constitutional and President Barack Obama was re-elected.

But don’t count Attorney General Pam Bondi among those officials.

In remarks at a Florida Chamber of Commerce event Nov. 28, 2012, Bondi said the health care law is already hurting businesses.

""Unfortunately, national studies are already showing the negative effects that the health care law is having on businesses and our economy. Businesses across the country are raising their prices in order to compensate for their added costs due to Obama’s health care plan. If they aren’t raising prices, they’re cutting jobs as a result of the added cost, both of which hurt our economy. According to a Mercer survey, more than 60 percent of employers expect the federal health care plan to increase their health costs. Twenty percent of those employers are bracing for at least a 5 percent increase in costs.""

This comment caught our attention because added costs for business under the health care law do not start until 2014. So why would they be raising prices and cutting jobs now?

First, a bit of background: In 2014, the law’s major requirements take effect. Individuals will have to have health insurance or pay a penalty. And large employers will have to offer health insurance or pay a penalty. Employers with fewer than 50 employees are exempt, and large employers that already offer health insurance are not affected.

Translation: Most large employers who don’t offer their employees health insurance will be subject to the penalty.

But again, those penalties haven’t started yet, which made us question Bondi’s statement that businesses ""are raising prices"" and ""cutting jobs"" as a result of the law.

Employers have seen some new requirements since the law went into effect. One requirement that has started is that parents be allowed to add adult children to their policies. Another regulation forbids caps on how much insurance will pay over the course of someone’s lifetime. But we didn’t find evidence of these regulations leading to higher prices or eliminated jobs.

We contacted Bondi’s office and asked for evidence of Bondi’s remarks. They provided the Mercer survey that Bondi mentioned, as well as news reports on businesses preparing for the health care law’s requirements. We’ll review that evidence here.

The Mercer survey

We contacted Mercer, a health care consulting company, and obtained the survey Bondi referenced. It was conducted two weeks after the Supreme Court decision and queried 1,215 employers of various sizes.

As Bondi said, the survey found that 61 percent of employers expected cost increases.

Employers were asked to estimate the cost impact of the health law’s key provisions that go into effect in 2014. Here are the survey’s findings on costs:

* 10 percent of employers said they expected no increase in costs;
* 10 percent of employers said they expected a less than 1 percent increase in costs;
* 17 percent of employers said they expected a 1 to 2 percent increase in costs;
* 14 percent of employers said they expected a 3 to 4 percent increase in costs;
* 20 percent of employers said they expected a 5 percent or more increase in costs;
* 29 percent of employers said they didn’t know what to expect.

So Bondi is correct on the specific numbers she cited. However, she was selective in quoting the survey’s findings. For example, another way to read the results is that 51 percent of employers expected their costs to go up 4 percent or less.

A spokesperson for Mercer told us their surveys show employers are actually lowering their estimates of the cost impact as the law’s actual implementation gets closer.

Finally, we should note that the Mercer survey asked employers to predict what they thought would happen in 2014. It did not ask employers about how the law is affecting their actions today. And it did not show that businesses are raising their prices or laying off workers, as Bondi suggested.

News coverage

Bondi’s office also pointed us to news stories about how businesses are reacting to the health care law, reports from conservative think tanks and opinion pieces from conservative outlets that oppose the law.

The most relevant and persuasive evidence that the law would raise prices or cause layoffs were news stories about how the law would affect the restaurant industry. Franchise owners for restaurants such as Papa John’s have said they intend to reduce workers’ hours or add surcharges to their food in order to comply with the health care law’s requirements.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Nov. 3, 2012, that companies such as Darden Restaurants of Orlando, which runs Red Lobster and Olive Garden, were shifting their workforce from full-timers to part-timers to try to avoid paying penalties.

We found this evidence interesting, but anecdotal, and not definitive. The chief executive officer for Papa John’s, for example, wrote an op-ed for the Huffington Post to correct reports that the pizza chain was laying off workers.

""Many in the media reported that I said Papa John's is going to close stores and cut jobs because of Obamacare. I never said that,"" wrote John Schnatter on Nov. 20, 2012. ""The fact is we are going to open over hundreds of stores this year and next and increase employment by over 5,000 jobs worldwide. And, we have no plans to cut team hours as a result of the Affordable Care Act.""

Still, we found no large-scale studies showing that many businesses are currently raising prices or laying off workers to prepare for the health law.

In 2010, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office studied the law’s effects on the nationwide labor force and found the effects would be minimal. Also, most of the economic effects of the law would happen after the provisions took effect, not before.

""To the extent that changes in the health insurance system lead to improved health status among workers, the nation’s economic productivity could be enhanced,"" the CBO said in its report. ""It is not clear, however, whether such changes would have a substantial impact on overall economic productivity or output. Moreover, many of the effects of the legislation may not be felt for several years because it will take time for workers and employers to recognize and to adapt to the new incentives.""

Our ruling

Bondi said, ""National studies are already showing the negative effects that the health care law is having on businesses and our economy. Businesses across the country are raising their prices … (or) cutting jobs as a result of the added cost.""

It’s true that some large businesses -- specifically, those with more than 50 employees who do not currently offer their employees health insurance -- will face new costs because of the health care law. Starting in 2014, they will have to offer their employees health insurance or pay a financial penalty to the federal government.

But Bondi’s comments ignore two points: These requirements haven’t taken effect yet, and it’s not clear whether businesses will find themselves forced to raise prices or cut jobs. We found no credible national studies showing these widespread effects, and certainly not showing those effects right now.

We don’t doubt there’s anxiety among some businesses over what’s to come under the health care law, and maybe some are talking about whether they’ll have to raise prices or cut jobs. But Bondi didn’t talk about planning, she talked about what’s occuring right now, and we find no studies already showing the negative effects or evidence that businesses are cutting jobs or raising prices now. We rate Bondi’s statement False.","[(""\nTampa Bay Times, Bondi says 'Obamacare' already having negative effect on businesses, Nov. 28, 2012\n\nMercer, Health Care Reform, After the Decision, Mercer’s Series of Survey’s on Health Care Reform, 2012\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: An Update, Effects of Recent Health Care Legislation on Labor Markets, p. 48, August 2010\n\nInterview with Jennifer Meale of the Office of Attorney General Pam Bondi\n\nInterview with Mark Wilson of the Florida Chamber of Commerce, Nov. 30, 2012\n\nEmail interviews with Stephanie Poe and Beth Umland of Mercer, Nov. 29, 2012\n\nPolitiFact Florida, Rick Scott's story of a small business doesn't match with the law's actual rules, June 29, 2012\n\nWashington Times, Obama keeps job; others lose theirs, Nov. 11, 2012\n\nAmerican Action Forum, The state by state impact of ACA regulations, accessed Nov. 29, 2012\n\nWashington Times, Study: Obamacare regs have cost $27.6 billion, killed 30,000 jobs, Oct. 9, 2012\n\nWall Street Journal, Health law spurs shift in hours, Nov. 4, 2012\n\nForbes, Another Broken Obama Promise: The Healthcare Cost Monster Emerges, Oct. 1, 2012"", 'http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/bondi-says-obamacare-already-having-negative-effect-businesses')]",/factchecks/2012/nov/30/pam-bondi/pam-bondi-said-national-studies-show-businesses-ar/

Josh Mandel says his senate contest with Sherrod Brown the closest in three decades in Ohio
","
Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, but it can provide a bit of consolation in politics.

Strategists like Karl Rove, whose two Republican-allied super PACs -- American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS -- were among the biggest spenders in the campaign season just ended, suggested that their spending kept a number of races closer than they otherwise might have been.

Among the races, and one of the 10 Senate contests in which Crossroads GPS invested, was the match between Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown and the Republican state treasurer, Josh Mandel. Crossroads GPS contributed nearly $6.4 million to the unsuccessful effort to defeat Brown, making it the biggest third-party spender in a race that was one of the nation's costliest, according to figures gathered by the nonprofit Sunlight Foundation.

Mandel, in an email thanking his supporters, said one of them had pointed out ""that our race was the closest U.S. Senate race in Ohio in 36 years -- when Howard Metzenbaum defeated Robert Taft in 1976.""

True? PolitiFact Ohio couldn't resist an excuse to dig into history.

We looked first at current unofficial election results from Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. They show Brown defeated Mandel by 278,052 ballots, or 50.35 percent of the vote to Mandel's 45.06 percent.

Then we checked the official record on the secretary's website. Of the 11 Senate races going back to 1976, none was as close as the Brown-Mandel match. Most were comparatively lopsided, in fact, including Brown's victory margin of more than 12 percent in 2006.

In 1976, Metzenbaum defeated Robert Taft Jr., the Republican incumbent, by a margin of 117,339 votes, or 3 percent of the vote. Not only closer than the Brown-Mandel race, it was a reverse rematch of the 1970 election in which Taft reached the Senate, defeating Metzenbaum by a margin of 70,420 votes, or  2 percent.

Taft was a congressman, father of the former governor and son of the famed three-term senator who was nicknamed ""Mr. Republican."" Before his two tight contests with Metzenbaum, he lost his first bid for the Senate in an even closer race.

In 1964, the year of Lyndon Johnson's presidential landslide over Barry Goldwater, Taft lost to incumbent Democrat Stephen Young by just 0.5 percent. It was Ohio's closest Senate election of the last half century.

PolitiFact Ohio found the history interesting.

Realtors push Congress to extend foreclosure bill
","
In Washington, much of the political conversation these days surrounds a ""fiscal cliff"" of tax increases and drastic budget cuts that could ignite another economic recession if lawmakers don’t reach a compromise on such issues before this year ends.

One organization, though, recently raised its concerns about another piece of federal legislation and its potential impact on many American homeowners if Congress doesn’t act before Dec. 31.

The National Association of Realtors posted an item on its Realtor Party webpage with a ""Call for Action"" about a law set to expire this year. A PolitiFact Georgia follower on Twitter asked us to check out the accuracy of the information.

""Congress will soon return to Washington with unfinished business to complete. One of those items is a housing issue that could affect almost one-quarter of all real estate transactions -- the expiration of Mortgage Forgiveness Tax Relief,"" the webpage says.

""Without action before the end of the year, millions of families who hold distressed properties could face a hefty tax bill for trying to modify their mortgage or to seek a short sale through their lender. Even those facing foreclosure will find themselves forced to pay a ‘foreclosure tax’ if Congress doesn’t act."" 

Walter Molony, a spokesman for the association, said ""distressed properties"" is a reference to homeowners who owe more on their loans than the property is worth. As for a ""foreclosure tax,"" Molony said that ""is our term of art to highlight that a family would face income tax on the amount of the loan forgiven after a foreclosure."" 

In late 2007, Congress passed the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act to help the rising number of homeowners whose finances were being demolished by foreclosures. The act prevents homeowners from being taxed for the cancellation of any debt by a lender during a loan modification or foreclosure. The federal act applies for the years 2007 through 2012.
The Internal Revenue Service’s website offers an example of how it works:

""You borrow $10,000 and default on the loan after paying back $2,000. If the lender is unable to collect the remaining debt from you, there is a cancellation of debt of $8,000, which generally is taxable income to you.""

If the cancellation of debt is $100,000, a borrower could be taxed on that amount.

Generally, the debt must have been used to buy, build or substantially improve the taxpayer's principal residence and must have been secured by that residence. Debt forgiven on second homes, rental property, business property, credit cards or car loans does not qualify, the IRS says.

The maximum amount of debt a homeowner can claim is $2 million or $1 million if you’re filing a tax return as a single payer. IRS spokesman Mark Green stressed that point with PolitiFact Georgia, since it was not mentioned in the ""Call for Action.""

In 2011, the estimated tax savings to borrowers from the exemption was at least $1 billion, The New York Times reported, quoting calculations by the association. 

Some estimates show short sales account for 20 percent to 25 percent of all homes sold in recent months across the country. Slightly more than 4 percent of U.S. homes were in foreclosure, according to a Bloomberg article published in August.

It’s unclear whether Congress will pass any legislation to extend the act. Some National Association of Realtors officials believe Congress will pass an extension at the last minute. A one-year extension would cost the federal government about $1.3 billion, according to some estimates.

Let’s recap. The National Association of Realtors wrote that millions of Americans could face a hefty tax bill if Congress does not extend this act. It’s possible, if the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act isn’t extended. The Realtors’ estimate that it could have an impact on one-quarter of transactions seems on target, if you add up the percentage of homes in foreclosure and short sales. The association’s ""Call for Action"" could have used the additional detail about the amount of debt borrowers could write off. We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('\nNational Association of Realtors, ""Call for Action: Keep the Housing Recovery on Track.""

"['Environment', 'Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Energy', 'Jobs', 'Labor', 'Technology', 'Sheldon Whitehouse']","
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says more people in U.S. work in green energy than in petroleum industry
","Supporters of environmentally compatible technology have been arguing of late that ""going green"" doesn’t only help preserve the environment, it adds to the nation’s employment rate.

One of them is U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, who, in an interview published in The Providence Journal Nov. 18, said, ""We have more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas in this country.""

To some, the green economy evokes images of people weaving rugs out of palm fronds, or growing their own vegetables. But an increasing number of studies are showing that developing environmentally sensitive products and services has become a growing and technologically sophisticated segment of the economy.

But more jobs than Big Oil? We decided to drill down and see if Whitehouse was right.

Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson said the senator’s source was a July 2011 report, ""Sizing the Clean Economy,"" by the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, and the Battelle Technology Partnership Practice, a consulting firm that advises companies and governments on how to use new technologies to improve their operations.

The study sought to calculate how many companies in the United States are involved in so-called green industries, how many people they employ and how much of an impact the field has on the national economy.

In a summary of the report, Brookings said, ""the clean economy, which employs some 2.7 million workers, encompasses a significant number of jobs in establishments spread across a diverse group of industries. Though modest in size, the clean economy employs more workers than the fossil fuel industry …"" Brookings pegged the number of fossil fuel jobs at 2.4 million.

The report noted that the ""clean economy"" is an emerging concept that can mean different things to different people. The Brookings report said it focused on firms that either sold products or performed services that provided a definable environmental benefit, such as companies that clean up hazardous waste or manufacture solar panels.  

""No effort was made here to count companies that adopt internal environmental goals, reform their processes to make them more environmentally responsible or even contribute to general public knowledge about environmental issues,"" the report said.

""This study measures only employment in establishments that directly produce goods and services with environmental benefits.""

The survey began by taking an analysis from Dun & Bradstreet, which has developed a system to classify businesses on the basis of what they do or produce. Added to that database were similar lists developed the Pew Charitable Trust and the University of California at Berkeley.

Brookings researchers then examined other sources, such as industry association membership lists, patent applications, lists of companies receiving grants, to refine the roster.

It was a net that caught a wide swath of businesses, ranging from organic food farming to forestry, manufacturers of fuel cells and other types of energy conservation technology to mass transit, air and water purification to trash disposal to geothermal wind and solar power equipment manufacturers.

Add up the employees in those businesses, the Brookings report said, and you get 2.7 million.

In addition, a 2011 analysis by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics found that ""businesses that produce goods and services that benefit the environment or conserve natural resources"" accounted for 3.1 million jobs.

But what about the other number in the comparison -- the number of employees in the fossil-fuel industry.

Because that industry has been around for years, it has been widely studied and classified. Brookings got its 2.4 million number of oil industry jobs from a study by Moody’s Analytics, which counted jobs directly related to producing fossil-fuel based energy, and distributors and transporters, such as gas station employees.

Now, if you watch any television these days, you’ve no doubt seen a commercial from the American Petroleum Institute that boasts of 9.2 million American jobs that are supported by the U.S. oil industry. That’s nearly four times the Brookings’ claim.

But according to Petroleum Institute’s website, that includes not only people who work in the oil industry, but in industries that depend on petroleum to function. For example, because airlines need fuel to fly their jets, the Petroleum Institute counted pilots, flight attendants and ground crews as oil-related jobs.

Counting only jobs directly connected to producing and distributing oil and natural gas, the Petroleum Institute came up with 2.2 million jobs -- 200,000 fewer than the Brookings count.

Our ruling

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said more people in the United States work in green energy than in the petroleum industry.

Whitehouse’s statement was based on a rigorous study by the Brookings Institution.  A similar analysis by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics found the number to be even greater.

"['New Jersey', 'Elections', 'States', 'Raymond Bateman']","
Raymond Bateman says Tom Kean won the 1985 gubernatorial election by largest margin in state’s history
","
If Newark Mayor Cory Booker declines to run for the state’s highest office, a former state legislator predicts a decisive -- possibly even historic -- re-election victory for Gov. Chris Christie 

Raymond Bateman, a former Republican state senator and assemblyman who lost a bid for governor in 1977, said in a recent column that Booker seems like the only Democrat capable of foiling Christie’s prospects for a second term.

""Unless Booker gets into the race, 2013 reminds me of 1985. That was the year Tom Kean made history with the largest-ever New Jersey gubernatorial victory,"" Bateman wrote in a Nov. 23 column published in The Asbury Park Press. ""Kean, who barely won (by 1,797 votes) in 1981, destroyed his 1985 opponent, Peter Shapiro, winning by a majority of more than 750,000 votes, the largest winning margin for a gubernatorial candidate in Jersey history."" 

""In any case,"" Bateman wrote later in his column, ""2013 should see a political barn-burning election in New Jersey that I believe will produce a Kean-like victory for Christie if, in fact, he runs.""

This week Christie announced he will seek a second term. Potential Democratic rivals -- including Booker -- have not formally declared their intentions. 

The outcome of any matchup wouldn’t be determined until next year, but until then PolitiFact New Jersey wondered whether Bateman’s comparison was rooted in fact. Did Kean, a Republican, rebound from a close election to a historically decisive re-election bid?

The data -- whether it’s broken down by total votes or percentages -- shows that’s true.

More than 1.37 million New Jerseyans cast their vote for Kean that year, while Shapiro, the Democratic candidate and a former Essex County executive, won about 578,000 votes.

So Kean won by more than 790,000 votes, according to election data published in the state’s legislative manual. 

No other governor in New Jersey’s history has won election by a larger margin. 

In all, Kean won more than 69 percent of the vote, carrying every one of New Jersey’s 21 counties and all but three municipalities.

It’s worth noting that  Kean’s sweeping victory came four years after he narrowly won office. In 1981 Kean defeated Democrat Jim Florio by fewer than 1,800 votes, which represented less than one twelfth of one percent of the total vote.

No other gubernatorial race was closer as a percentage of the total vote, though in 1880 the Democratic candidate won by only 651 votes. That accounted for about one-quarter of one percent of the total vote. 

Our ruling

Bateman said that in the 1985 general election Kean had ""the largest winning margin for a gubernatorial candidate in Jersey history.""

Kean trounced his opponent that year. 

The former Republican governor won more than 1.37 million votes, compared with the roughly 578,000 ballots cast for his Democratic rival. 

That means Kean won by more than 790,000 votes. That’s the largest margin of victory for a gubernatorial election in New Jersey’s history.

We rate this statement True.

Jobs Ohio claims the Buckeye State nearly tops for new jobs in last year
","
The nasty political ads have been gone for weeks, but the launch of a marketing campaign aimed at trumpeting Ohio’s improving economy offers a preview of the next great election battle.

JobsOhio, the state’s private economic development agency, is on air with a 30-second commercial that celebrates workers of all stripes and conveys an optimistic message.

The agency is the brainchild of Republican Gov. John Kasich, who has ridden Ohio’s rising fortunes to rising poll numbers. And the ""Thrive in Ohio"" spot, which also asks viewers to share their success stories on a web site, has rankled Democrats hoping to unseat Kasich in 2014.

Never mind that the spot doesn’t feature Kasich or identify him or the governor’s office in any way. Democrats see a calculated political move bankrolled by state development money. The push also includes print advertising and will cost $1.4 million, the Columbus Dispatch reported.

Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald, one potential challenger to Kasich, has publicly called on Kasich to suspend the campaign, declaring it a waste of taxpayer dollars.

Given the dust-up surrounding the JobsOhio blitz and the role the state’s economy is sure to play in the gubernatorial race, PolitiFact Ohio decided to evaluate the claim central to the TV spot.

""In the past year alone, Ohio businesses have created more jobs than almost every other state in the country,"" an unseen narrator says, his words scored to an inspirational piano melody. ""And it’s only the beginning.""

So how does the statement stack up when peeled away from such slick marketing?

Laura Jones, communications director for JobsOhio, cited employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Via email, Jones said the numbers showed that from October 2011 through October 2012, only California, Texas and New York created more jobs than Ohio.

Jones referred us to the bureau’s Regional and State Employment and Unemployment report. According to seasonally adjusted employment numbers in October, 30 states reported statistically significant increases in employment year-over-year -- Ohio among them.

Table E, found on page seven of the 21-page report, breaks down the employment trends by state. Since October 2011, according to preliminary data, Ohio has added 96,500 jobs. Indeed, that increase ranks fourth, behind the more-populated California, Texas and New York.

Because the report was dated Nov. 20, three days after JobsOhio posted the commercial to YouTube, PolitiFact Ohio went back to look at the previous month’s report, which evaluated the period from September 2011 and September 2012. We found the Buckeye State in the same position: fourth among states with statistically significant employment increases.

We also checked with George Zeller, an economic research analyst from Cleveland. He was familiar with the Thrive in Ohio campaign and, after paging through the BLS reports agreed that the numbers cited by JobsOhio were legitimate.

But what do the numbers prove?

""What they’re saying there is that Ohio’s No. 4,"" Zeller said. ""What you have to recognize is that of course we’re going to gain more jobs than Vermont, because Vermont is smaller. There are 50 states, so being fourth is higher than others. But we’re by no means at the top.""

Zeller makes a valid point. Ohio, by virtue of being one of the nation’s most populous states, is destined to have and add more jobs than smaller states. Ohio is the seventh-most populous state, according to Census figures, ranking behind California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois and Pennsylvania. In terms of jobs added, Ohio is up there with other highly populated states.

Zeller also noted that Ohio’s recovery, while real, is coming slowly. At current pace, said Zeller, citing his research, it will take the state 11 years to recover all jobs lost during the recession.

""There’s nothing untrue about what [JobsOhio] said,"" Zeller continued via telephone. ""Now does that mean that we are outstripping the rest of the country? No. First of all, because we lost more jobs than the rest of the country did … we have to do a lot more to make them up.""

Of course Democrats will come armed with other numbers as the gubernatorial fight nears. They often cite BLS data that show the state’s unemployment rate began dropping in early 2010, under Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland and and Democratic President Barack Obama.

To their point, it’s worth noting that public policy set outside Ohio affects the state’s economy. Exhibit A: The federal government’s bailout of the U.S. auto industry, a huge Ohio employer.

As such, Democrats argue that Ohio was en route to economic recovery months before Kasich defeated Strickland in the November 2010 election. Ironically, Kasich’s constant ballyhooing of these improved prospects was at odds with the message pushed by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and might have helped Obama’s re-election bid this year.

Now that the race for the White House in the rearview mirror, it is no surprise that Democrats see the JobsOhio commercial as the unofficial kickoff of Kasich’s re-election campaign. Perhaps that makes this the unofficial kickoff of PolitiFact Ohio’s monitoring of the contest, whether it’s FitzGerald, Strickland or another candidate who takes on the incumbent governor in 2014.

For its Thrive in Ohio campaign, JobsOhio said businesses here ""have created more jobs than almost every other state in the country"" over the last year. A second later, the ad’s narrator added: ""And it’s only the beginning."" That qualifier is appropriate given the perspective Zeller supplied. Considering Ohio’s size, a statement about the state’s comparatively high level of job creation is not the ultimate benchmark of success.

JobsOhio seems to realize this.

John Cornyn says veterans’ disability claims backlog doubled in Obama’s first term
","
In legislation filed this week, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn touts a Texas-tested method to address backlogged veterans’ disability claims, a problem he recently highlighted on Twitter.

On Nov. 19, 2012, the Texas Republican tweeted, ""Veterans' disability claims backlog had doubled during POTUS's first term. He needs to announce a plan to reduce it. ASAP.""

Reducing the Department of Veterans Affairs backlog was one of the campaign promises Barack Obama made in 2008 as he ran for POTUS (president of the United States). PolitiFact rated it a Promise Broken in a Nov. 2, 2012, article that delved into some of the reasons the problem had grown worse.

The term ""backlog"" is used in this context as shorthand for claims that have gone unaddressed by the government for 125 days involving military veterans’ disability compensation and pensions and compensation for surviving spouses or children of veterans who die because of their military service.

PolitiFact said the nationwide backlog ""nearly doubled from roughly 36 percent in summer 2010 to 65 percent in June 2012,"" due in part to the influx of veterans returning from war in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Texas’ backlog doubled from July 2010 to July 2012, the Austin American-Statesman reported in a July 16, 2012, news story. And the VA claims office in Waco has both the nation’s longest wait and the nation’s largest backlog, according to an Aug. 14, 2012, Statesman article and Cornyn’s Nov. 12, 2012, opinion column in the Waco Tribune-Herald.

Cornyn’s legislation, according to his Nov. 28, 2012, press release, would require the VA to come up with a national plan similar to its recent partnership with the Texas Veterans’ Commission, which assists veterans with their claims individually.

We asked Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie for details on the senator’s tweet about Obama’s first term, which began Jan. 20, 2009. His second term begins Jan. 21, 2013.

Brandewie emailed us data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Looking at numbers from the department’s weekly reports, Brandewie said, there were 86,687 backlogged claims on Jan. 24, 2009, and 597,636 on Nov. 17, 2012. That, we calculated, is a 589 percent increase.

But, Brandewie noted, there’s a hitch in those numbers. Before October 2009, he said, the VA considered a claim backlogged if it had gone unaddressed for more than 180 days. Then the department raised the bar. Beginning that month, a claim was backlogged if it had been pending for more than 125 days.

That meant a lot of claims were immediately reclassified as backlogged. The agency’s Sept. 26, 2009, report has 88,195 claims older than 180 days; the next report, issued Oct. 3, 2009, has 158,290 claims pending for more than 125 days.

We wondered if 180-day-late claims had doubled on Obama’s watch, but the VA reports stopped including that statistic after the 2009 change. As an alternative, we checked the longest span of days we could get with the 125-day measure -- Oct. 3, 2009 to Nov. 17, 2012. The result: a 278 percent increase.

Veterans’ Affairs spokesman Randy Noller, whom we interviewed by phone, sent us data that matches the numbers Brandewie sent us.

Brandewie also pointed out that the backlog had doubled in another way: as a percentage of the whole. Two years ago, less than a third of all such veterans’ claims were pending. Now, more than two-thirds of all claims are pending.

Why did the backlog increase so much? Noller told us, ""We’ve got more claims being filed now than ever before.""

PolitiFact said the VA added staff, but it wasn’t enough to keep up with a sharp increase in claims volume, much less reduce the past backlog.

The undersecretary for the Veterans Benefits Administration, Allison Hickey, said the volume of claims rose 48 percent from 2008 through 2011 -- from 888,000 to 1.3 million -- in testimony to a U.S. House subcommittee July 18, 2012.

That’s despite a decline in the number of veterans, which dropped about 6 percent in the same period --  from 23.4 million in 2008 to 22.2 million in 2011 by the department’s VetPop estimates and from 23.2 million in 2008 to 21.5 million in 2011 according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Noller told us ""ten years’ worth of war"" in Iraq and Afghanistan is a large factor.

Because of advances in technology and tactics, ""more of our people are coming back alive,"" he said, and they report more medical conditions per person than their Vietnam and World War II predecessors.

Those older veterans face additional problems of their own as they age, according to a Sept. 27, 2012, New York Times news story. ""The department is administering pensions for World War II veterans while handling new claims from Vietnam veterans struggling with the multiplying ailments of age,"" the story said.

In her testimony, Hickey said another major contributor to the backlog pile-up has been claims involving Agent Orange, a herbicide the U.S. sprayed to reduce vegetation providing enemy cover in Vietnam.

The Aug. 4, 2012, Statesman news story said rules adopted in 2010 made it easier for Vietnam veterans to file claims based on post-traumatic stress disorder and exposure to Agent Orange.

The Times story said that even though Veterans Affairs ""added nearly 4,000 new workers since 2008, the agency did not keep pace.""

Our ruling

Cornyn said the backlog of veterans’ claims doubled in Obama’s first term.

Counting from Jan. 24, 2009, forward yields an increase of 589 percent. This is an overstatement, though, since the government lowered its threshold for declaring a claim as backlogged after Obama became president. Still, the backlog has tripled since the lower threshold was imposed in October 2009.

Experts say federal law trumps state law on 'Obamacare exchange' claim
","Georgians who oppose Obamacare can rest a little easier.

According to one health care expert, they don’t have to worry about one particular element of what’s officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Three days after the presidential election, Michael Cannon, the director of health policy studies for the Cato Institute, wrote an article in the National Review saying that states are under no obligation to create health care exchanges.

He then wrote a claim we hadn’t heard before.

""[O]perating an Obamacare exchange would be illegal in 14 states,"" he wrote. ""Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, and Virginia have enacted either statutes or constitutional amendments (or both) forbidding state employees to participate in an essential exchange function: implementing Obamacare’s individual and employer mandates.""

Is that correct? PolitiFact Georgia decided to conduct an examination of the claim.

Cannon told an Atlanta Journal-Constitution health reporter via email that he based his statement on Senate Bill 411, passed by the Georgia Legislature in 2010 and signed into law by then-Gov. Sonny Perdue. Cannon cited this particular portion of the bill: ""To preserve the freedom of citizens of this state to provide for their health care: No law or rule or regulation shall compel, directly or indirectly, any person, employer, or health care provider to participate in any health care system.""

Cannon declined via email to comment for our fact check, saying he’s continuing his boycott against the PolitiFact franchise. He ended his email with a Latin phrase Cannon has used in other articles, Tyrannis delenda est., which means ""tyranny must be destroyed."" The Washington-based Cato Institute advocates for limited government intervention on social and business matters.

The federal health care law, passed in March 2010, gives states the opportunity to organize health care exchanges where consumers and small businesses will be able to compare the quality and prices of health plans. If states won’t create an exchange, the federal government will do it. Gov. Nathan Deal announced Nov. 16 that he would not set up an exchange under the health care law.

Most conservatives and libertarians were livid about the provision in the federal health care law known as the ""individual mandate,"" which requires Americans to buy health insurance and the majority of employers to provide it. Twenty-six states, including Georgia, filed a lawsuit to overturn the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act shortly after President Barack Obama signed it into law in March 2010.

Georgia SB 411 was an attempt to counter the federal law. Senate Republicans pushed for the legislation after Democrats refused to support a similar amendment to the Georgia Constitution. Perdue signed the bill in June 2010.

PolitiFact Georgia has delved into this topic before. In 2010, Sen. Judson Hill, a Marietta Republican, sent a mailer to potential voters in his district saying he had ""stood up to Barack Obama by passing legislation that prevents you from being forced to join government health plans or buy health insurance against your will."" Hill was referring to SB 411.

PolitiFact Georgia found experts who noted that the state action would have little impact because the federal government has ""extremely broad"" power to provide incentives and disincentives through the tax code. With those caveats, and the uncertainty over the federal health care law’s future, Hill’s claim was rated Half True.

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the health care law in a 5-4 ruling. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the individual mandate may ""reasonably"" be characterized as a tax.

A spokeswoman for Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, a vocal critic of the federal law, said his office does not generally speak on state law when Olens is not directly engaged in the issue.

Bill Custer, director of Georgia State University’s Center for Health Services Research, qualified in his comments to us that he’s not an attorney, but he believes the federal health care law overrides any state legislation.

""My understanding is that there is no compulsion in any part of the law now (that was what the Supreme Court ruled this summer) so the state law is moot and in any case federal law supersedes state law on this issue,"" Custer said via email.

Other nonpartisan experts we contacted agreed.

""Federal law trumps state law,"" said Russ Toal, director of the Office of Public Health Practice/Community Service at Georgia Southern University. ""I don’t think (Cannon’s claim) is accurate.""

Kathleen Burch, an associate professor at Atlanta’s John Marshall Law School, said the state law doesn’t prohibit the creation of an exchange. Burch, who specializes in constitutional law, also cited the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, which gives the federal law authority over inconsistent state exercise of power.

To sum up, Cannon wrote that creating a health care exchange under the 2010 federal health care law would be ""illegal"" in Georgia and 13 other states. He wrote that those states have legislation that precludes ""implementing Obamacare’s individual and employer mandates."" The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the individual mandate was allowable under the Constitution. The experts we spoke to and others note federal law supersedes state law here.

We rate this claim False.","[('National Review, ""Obamacare Is Still Vulnerable,"" Nov. 9, 2012.', 'http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/333040/obamacare-still-vulnerable-michael-f-cannon'), ('National Review, ""The Mandate Today,"" Aug. 12, 2011.', 'No link'), ('Email from Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies, Cato Institute, Nov. 16, 2012\n\nEmail from Lauren Kane, spokeswoman for Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, Nov. 16, 2012\n\nEmail from Bill Custer, director, Center for Health Services Research, Georgia State University, Nov. 20, 2012\n\nGeorgia Senate Bill 411.', 'http://www.nationalreview.com/critical-condition/274516/mandate-today-michael-f-cannon'), ('PolitiFact Georgia, ""State Senator said he’s fighting Obama on health care,"" June 21, 2010.', 'No link'), ('Telephone interview with Russ Toal, director, Office of Public Health Practice/Community Service, Georgia Southern University, Nov. 20, 2012.\n\nTelephone interview with Kathleen Burch, associate professor, John Marshall Law School, Nov. 26, 2012.', 'http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2009_10/pdf/sb411.pdf')]",/factchecks/2012/nov/28/michael-cannon/experts-say-federal-law-trumps-state-law-obamacare/

Red-light cameras don't impress Roswell
","
Roswell city leaders recently met to discuss a proposal to hit the brakes on red-light cameras.

The idea to remove them is not new, but a claim about their effectiveness was interesting enough that we thought it should be put on the Truth-O-Meter.

""When you look at the number of crashes before the cameras were installed compared to after, they’re virtually the same,"" said Steve Acenbrak, the city’s transportation director.

Is that true?

Roswell, a north Fulton city with a population of 91,168, has two red-light cameras. One sits at the intersection of Ga. 9 and Ga. 92/Holcomb Bridge Road. The other camera is located at Ga. 9 and Ga. 140/Mansell Road. The cameras were installed in February 2007.

Red-light cameras became popular in many cities and counties as a way to reduce the number of motorists who run red lights and hit other vehicles or pedestrians who assumed they had the right of way. 

There is an ongoing argument about whether the cameras are effective when it comes to reducing accidents. 

The National Motorists Association, a group advocating motorists’ rights, has led the fight against the cameras.

""There is no evidence that these ticket camera systems make drivers more safe,"" the association states on its website. ""In fact, the opposite has proven true. Ticket cameras increase accidents!""

A study by the Federal Highway Administration found that red-light cameras ""provide a modest aggregate crash-cost benefit."" The study found the cameras tend to reduce severe side-impact crashes, but increase less-severe rear-end collisions. 

The city of Alpharetta has red-light cameras at more intersections (seven) than any community in Georgia, according to state records. Atlanta has working cameras at six intersections, the records show.

The city of Snellville, though, removed its cameras a few years ago. City officials said the number of violators was so small that it wasn’t cost-effective to keep them.

Roswell officials have made a similar case to scrap its cameras, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Acenbrak said the city researched the number of wrecks at those intersections three years before the cameras were installed and three years afterward. The state Department of  Transportation does not do its own research of wrecks at intersections with red-light cameras. It collects the data from the cities and counties with cameras, a spokeswoman said.

Here’s what Acenbrak shared with PolitiFact Georgia at both intersections.

At the Ga. 9 and Holcomb Bridge Road intersection, there was a slightly higher ratio of collisions there after the camera was installed. Acenbrak said there were three wrecks in the 25 months prior to the cameras. There were three wrecks in the 22 months after the cameras were installed, he said.

At Ga. 9 and Mansell Road, there was a higher percentage of wrecks before the cameras were installed as opposed to the total afterward. Acenbrak’s numbers show there were three wrecks in the 13 months before the cameras were installed, a ratio of one collision about every four months. The director said there were two crashes in the 22 months afterward, a ratio of one wreck every 11 months.

Acenbrak said those numbers prove his point, along with other data he presented to us, such as less than 3 percent of wrecks throughout the city each year can be attributed to motorists running red lights.

""We still have red-light runners, but they’re not causing crashes,"" he said.

To summarize, Acenbrak said the number of wrecks at Roswell’s red-light camera intersections was virtually the same before and after the cameras were installed. At Ga. 9 and Holcomb Bridge Road, it was almost identical. At Ga. 9 and Mansell Road, the ratio of wrecks after the cameras were installed was smaller.

With that bit of clarity about the Mansell Road intersection, we rate Acenbrak’s claim Mostly True.

Sen. Ron Johnson says economy was not in free fall when Obama took office
","
The nation’s persistent unemployment and weak job growth were a focus of the 2012 presidential campaign, with Republicans arguing the problems showed flaws in how President Barack Obama tackled the economy.

In many ways, the Democratic argument was previewed more than a year before the election, when strategist David Axelrod described the situation Obama walked into:

""I think he came to office at a time of tremendous challenge in this country,"" Axelrod said. ""The economy was in free fall and we had two wars and someone said to me the other day, ‘You know his slogan should be GM is alive and bin Laden is dead.’ ""

We thought of that statement when we heard this one from first-term Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson:

""The reason we're not creating those jobs is because of the choices, the policies, that President Obama took,"" he said in an Oct. 10, 2012 appearance on CNN’s ""Starting Point"" show. ""You know, because here is the fact: he did not come into office with the economy in a free fall.""

Johnson continued:

""We were losing jobs, but the fact is, within two months, we entered the second quarter, we only lost 0.7 percent GDP (Gross Domestic Product). But the economy bottomed out and then we started recovery the third quarter.""

The show’s host, Soledad O’Brien, asked Johnson: ""You don't think the economy was in free fall then?""

Johnson responded: ""No. The economy began to recover in the third quarter. It'd basically flattened out by the second quarter and it actually grew close to 4 percent the next three quarters. But then President Obama's policies took effect and they started scaring consumers and business owners and as a result the economy totally stalled.""

While the comment came before the election, with Obama’s win it seems relevant to take a look at where things stood when he started.

The numbers

The National Bureau of Economic Research determined that the recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. So there’s no argument that Obama took office while the economy was in the midst of the downturn.

Matters worsened in the fall of 2008, before he took office, when credit markets seized up and companies and consumers found it virtually impossible to borrow money. The housing crisis accelerated, and job losses escalated dramatically.

One barometer of the economy is an index of 85 economic indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. A reading less than zero means below average growth. In January of 2009, the Chicago Fed index was -3.99, the lowest level reached during the months of the recession. Graphically, it’s the point on the bottom of a deep V shape.

Another measure is unemployment. The Labor Department said that in December 2008, the economy lost 661,000 non-farm jobs, in January 2009, that number reached 818,000.

Finally, there’s the Gross Domestic Product, a broader, quarterly measure of the economy. The change in GDP for the last three months of 2008 was -8.9 percent, and for the first three months of 2009 it was -6.7 percent. Of course, that figure includes more than the month of January.

Johnson’s case

When we asked Johnson about his statement, he did not dispute any of those numbers. Rather, he said, they prove his point.

""Yes we had a severe recession,"" he said. ""But by the time the president started governing, that recession had pretty much bottomed out.""

Johnson noted that many important economic indicators don’t function in real time -- they lag behind actual activity. That means that the Obama’s actions had little immediate impact on the economy, and when they were reflected, they showed a drag on the recovery.

""The economy began to recover in the third quarter,"" he said. ""It has basically flattened out by the second quarter. And it actually grew close to 4 percent in the next three quarters. But then President Obama’s policies took effect and started scaring consumers and business owners. And as a result, the economy totally stalled.""

Other views

Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls and an associate professor at Wisconsin Lutheran College, said the ""free fall"" characterization was a poor analogy to choose.

""It's probably more fair to simply say things were bad and to leave it at that,"" he said in an email. ""The economy isn't a ball hurtling through space. It's not an engine that runs out of a gas.  It is not a ship that needs steering. These are all analogies that can be useful and colorful at times, but like all analogies, they have their limits.""

Jacobsen added: ""In short, I'd say that Ron Johnson was literally correct: The economy was not in free fall. It was bad and many people probably didn't know whether things were going to get better or much worse. In hindsight, we now know that things continued to ‘go down hill,’ but wasn't dropping like a rock.""

Aldo Laurenti, deputy chief economist for Mesirow Financial, noted that stock market losses in the fall of 2008 continued into 2009.

""The Dow lost about 400 points in January 2009, following losses on the tunes of 2,100 points in October 2008 and another 1,000 in the two central weeks in November 2008,""he wrote in an email.

Laurenti said that the decline in gross domestic product was $313 billion in the last quarter of 2008, and $153 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Households lost assets of $2.4 trillion in that period of 2009, ""after losing a shocking $12.7 trillion for the whole year 2008,"" he said. Those assets included financial holdings, and also property, including real estate.

Mark Zandi, an economist with Moody’s Analytics, wrote about the housing part of the downturn in September 2012. He noted:  ""The Obama administration deserves credit for quickly ending the housing free fall. In particular, Obama empowered the Federal Housing Administration to ensure that households could find mortgages at low interest rates even during the worst phase of the financial panic. When banks were making few loans of any kind, mortgage borrowers could still obtain credit because of the FHA.""

Let’s add it up.

Johnson disputed Obama’s assertion that the economy was in ""free fall"" when he took office.

Was the economy plunging downward, hit bottom, or had it hit and was on the upswing? As Jacobsen notes, it’s hard to call January 2009 a time of free fall in a technical sense. Cratered might have been a better way for Team Obama to describe it.

Johnson is correct on the lagging nature of economic indicators and agrees that the economy was in rough shape at the time.

U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez says Latino voters made the difference in President Barack Obama’s popular vote victory
","
For U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, Latino voters made history this month as the decisive force behind President Barack Obama winning the popular vote over Republican candidate Mitt Romney.

About a week after the election, the Democratic senator claimed the race marked the first time when the popular vote was decided by Latino voters. Going forward, Republicans must face the growing electoral power of the Latino community, according to Menendez.

""For the first time in history, the share of the national popular vote margin is smaller than the Latino vote margin,"" Menendez said at a Nov. 14 event hosted by the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund.

The senator is correct that Latino voters in 2012 made the difference in securing Obama’s popular vote victory. But Menendez’s claim about this scenario occurring ""for the first time in history"" needs clarification.

Latino voters also delivered more than enough votes to make Vice President Al Gore the popular vote winner in 2000. But unlike Gore, Obama won both the popular vote and received enough electoral votes to win the election.

That means this year’s election marks the first time when Latino voters played a decisive role in electing the president, according to the founders of Latino Decisions, a Seattle, Wash.-based polling research firm.

The firm’s research has been widely cited by numerous media organizations, including the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal.

The senator’s claim is based on a recent study by Latino Decisions, in which it analyzed the results of a nationwide poll of Latinos conducted in the days leading up to the election.

Based on that poll, Latino Decisions estimated that Latinos gave Obama a net gain of 5.4 percent of all popular votes. Since Obama won the overall popular vote by about 2.8 percent, Latino voters put Obama over the finish line, according to Gary Segura, a political science professor and co-founder of Latino Decisions.

Applying the same methodology to exit polling data used by the Associated Press and major U.S. newspapers and television networks, PolitiFact New Jersey reached a similar conclusion.

But a similar scenario occurred in 2000, when Gore won the popular vote by a smaller margin than the net gain he received from Latino voters, according to exit polling data compiled by The New York Times.

Yet since Gore didn’t get enough electoral votes to win the presidency, 2012 marks the first year when Latino voters played a decisive role in a presidential election, according to Segura and Matt Barreto, also a political science professor and co-founder of Latino Decisions.

Barreto told us in an e-mail that Menendez’s comments ""are based entirely on our research, and the spirit of the comments were that Latinos ‘made a difference’ in the national election results for the first time ever -- that is accurate since Gore lost the EC (electoral college) vote.""

Kerri Talbot, Menendez’s chief counsel, echoed Barreto’s argument, saying the point of Menendez’s speech was that 2012 ""was the first time Latinos made a difference in the national election.""

""I understand your point about the 2000 election popular vote but the Latino vote was not decisive in that election given that Gore lost in the electoral college,"" Talbot said in an e-mail.

Our ruling

About a week after Obama won re-election, Menendez claimed: ""For the first time in history, the share of the national popular vote margin is smaller than the Latino vote margin.""

The senator’s correct that Latino voters put Obama over the top in winning the popular vote, according to both a Latino Decisions poll and exit polling data. But Menendez should have been clearer about the historic nature of the Latino vote in 2012.

The 2000 election was the first time when Latino voters delivered more than enough votes for a popular vote victory, but this year’s election marks the first time when Latinos were decisive in electing the overall winner, according to the founders of Latino Decisions.
