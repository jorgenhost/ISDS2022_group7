Palin claims loss of oil production in Gulf of Mexico will cost $8 billion a day in imports
","
In an exclusive interview with Fox News' Greta Van Susteren on board her ""One Nation"" bus tour, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said there will be a steep price to pay for President Barack Obama's decision to place a temporary moratorium on new drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

""The impacts of that moratorium, where 97 percent of our offshore has been locked up...what we're looking at now is 150,000 barrels per day less next year, and 200,000 barrels per day less being able to be developed from the gulf the year after because the moratorium disallowed the permitting process, disallowed rigs to be able to, economically speaking, stay in the gulf. They moved out,"" the former Republican vice presidential candidate said in the May 31, 2011, interview.

""So we're going to be looking at $8 billion a day that we're going to be pouring into foreign countries in order to import that make-up fuel that we're going to need to take the place of what we could have gotten out of the gulf.""

In a separate item, we looked at Palin's claim that the moratorium caused a projected drop in Gulf of Mexico oil production of 150,000 barrels a day this year and an additional 200,000 barrels a day next year (a claim we rated Barely True). Here we're going to tackle Palin's claim that because of a decrease in oil production from the moratorium, the U.S. is ""going to be looking at $8 billion a day that we're going to be pouring into foreign countries in order to import that make-up fuel that we're going to need to take the place of what we could have gotten out of the gulf.""

As we mentioned in our accompanying fact-check, Palin's figures on declining Gulf of Mexico oil production were high, but close. According to the government's Energy Information Administration short-term energy outlook report from May 2011, oil production from the gulf is projected to dip by 130,000 barrels a day this year and another 190,000 barrels a day in 2012. (It is inaccurate, however, for Palin to attribute the entirety of the drop to the moratorium, but for more on that, see our accompanying fact-check).

We're not sure exactly how Palin came up with her $8 billion a day figure. Palin's political action campaign did not respond to our inquiry about the figure she used. But some simple math shows she is way off.

According to the latest projections (May 2011) by the EIA, the government agency that keeps track of energy statistics, imported oil is expected to cost $104.58 per barrel in 2011 and $108.12 per barrel in 2012.

Let's assume demand stays constant and that any drop in domestic production is met with an equal, additional purchase of imported oil. So a drop in oil production of 130,000 barrels a day in the Gulf of Mexico in 2011 would mean the purchase of an additional 130,000 barrels a day from imports. That comes to $13.6 million a day.

But that's just 2011. The total projected drop in oil production in the gulf between 2010 and 2012 is 320,000 barrels per day. At projected 2012 prices ($108.12 per barrel), that comes to $34.6 million a day. So Palin's number of $8 billion a day is way, way off.

One other EIA statistic adds further perspective. According to the EIA's Annual Energy Outlook report (Table A11.) issued on April 26, 2011, the ""net import share of liquid fuels"" (the percentage of fuel we get from imports) is expected to steadily decline over the next 25 years; from 52 percent in 2009; to 49 percent in 2015; and eventually down to 42 percent in 2035. In other words, the EIA -- in a report prepared after the moratorium -- projected that our reliance on imported oil is expected to decrease over the long haul.

Palin is correct that the moratorium caused a dip in Gulf of Mexico oil production. But she overstated the amount of the dip attributable to the moratorium, and she grossly overstated the cost of that dip if a similar mount of oil is purchased from foreign sources. By the most generous accounting, the cost of that dip in oil production and the substitution of imports comes to a little less than $35 million a day. Palin said $8 billion a day. That's way off. We rate her claim Pants on Fire. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC85E0C0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/03/sarah-palin/palin-claims-loss-gulf-oil-production-gulf-will-co/

Palin claims Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium will cause projected 150,000 barrel a day production drop
","
In an exclusive interview with Fox News' Greta Van Susteren on board her ""One Nation"" bus tour, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin took a shot at President Barack Obama's decision to place a temporary moratorium on new drilling in the wake of the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

""We cannot keep going with the flow, as we have been with a moratorium in the gulf,"" the former Republican vice presidential candidate said in the May 31, 2011, interview. ""And then we're told by the White House there really isn't a moratorium. Yes, there is. The impacts of that moratorium, where 97 percent of our offshore has been locked up...what we're looking at now is 150,000 barrels per day less next year, and 200,000 barrels per day less being able to be developed from the gulf the year after, because the moratorium disallowed the permitting process, disallowed rigs to be able to, economically speaking, stay in the gulf. They moved out.

""So we're going to be looking at $8 billion a day that we're going to be pouring into foreign countries in order to import that make-up fuel that we're going to need to take the place of what we could have gotten out of the Gulf.""

We are going to break her statement into two fact checks. In a separate item, we looked at Palin's claim that the moratorium will mean that oil imports will cost the United States $8 billion a day.

Here, we'll deal with the first part, Palin's claim -- that ""what we're looking at now is 150,000 barrels per day less next year, and 200,000 barrels per day less being able to be developed from the gulf the year after, because the moratorium disallowed the permitting process, disallowed rigs to be able to, economically speaking, stay in the gulf.""

Palin's political action campaign did not respond to our inquiry about the figures she used. 
Palin's numbers are pretty close to the official projections from the government's Energy Information Administration, the federal agency that keeps track of energy statistics. According to the EIA's short-term energy outlook report from May 2011, crude oil production from the Gulf of Mexico (Table 4a.) is projected to go from 1.64 million barrels a day in 2010; to 1.51 million barrels a day in 2011; and down to 1.32 million barrels a day in 2012. In other words, oil production from the gulf is projected to dip by 130,000 barrels a day this year; and another 190,000 barrels a day in 2012. So Palin's numbers were a little high, but in the ballpark.

The bigger problem, however, is that Palin attributes the drop entirely to the moratorium.

That's part of it, said Jonathan Cogan, a spokesman for the EIA, but ""the factors behind the decline are not simply a matter of the moratorium."" It's also due to a natural decline in production from existing wells, he said.

In its May 10, 2011, report, the EIA spells out that the decline is ""because of production declines from existing fields and the impact of last year's drilling moratorium and the subsequent delay in issuing new drilling permits.""

So how much of the drop can be attributed to the moratorium and how much to natural production declines from existing fields?

The report doesn't say, but we think a similar EIA report from April 2010 (Table 4a) -- before the oil spill -- puts the issue into some perspective. Then, the EIA projected oil production from the Gulf of Mexico would drop by 100,000 barrels a day between 2010 and 2011. In other words, even before the oil spill and ensuing moratorium, the EIA expected a drop in oil production from the Gulf of Mexico. After the moratorium, the projected drop went from 100,000 barrels to 130,000 barrels a day. Since most of the forecast decline predates the oil spill and the moratorium, it is misleading to attribute it entirely to the moratorium.  And so we rate Palin's claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE40400>],/factchecks/2011/jun/03/sarah-palin/palin-claims-gulf-oil-drilling-moratorium-responsi/

Homeland Security chief says more contraband being seized
","As members of the Obama administration push for immigration reform, they’re casting themselves as border security hawks.

President Barack Obama said he has ""gone above and beyond"" what Republicans requested for border patrol.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, a former governor of Arizona, was even more emphatic during a May talk at the Atlanta Press Club. She said ""there has never been a larger, more sustained and better effort"" on the border than today.

""We have seized more currency, more drugs, more outbound arms in the past year than any year in our country’s history,""  Napolitano said.

Has the country’s haul of contraband really reached such historic highs?

We asked the Department of Homeland Security for proof. It gave us statistics for seizures by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration Customs Enforcement that compared two-and-a-half years under Obama and the last two-and-a-half years under President George W. Bush.

According to the data for the U.S.-Mexico border:

* Illegal currency seizures grew by about 75 percent from $124.5 million to $218.7 million.
* Illegal drug seizures grew 31 percent, from 3.2 million kilos to 4.2 million kilos.
* Illegal weapons seizures grew 64 percent from about 3,100 to 5,200.

We asked for more data, but despite more than two weeks of requests, DHS did not give us additional information. So we turned to other sources.

In October 2010, the Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm of the U.S. Congress, issued a report on the federal government’s effort to stop cross-border currency smuggling. Data show that cash seizures jumped after the March 2009 start of a program to boost seizures of outbound money and drugs.

During the first year of that program, Customs and Border Protection seized about $34 million heading out of the country on land, overwhelmingly from the southwest border. The agency seized $16.8 million in the year leading up to it.

The cash seizures, however, varied widely from about $1 million to $8 million per month and likely account for only a fraction of the money that crosses the borders. An estimated $18 billion to $39 billion is smuggled out of the southwest border each year, according to the GAO report.

Marijuana drug seizures increased almost 50 percent from 1.6 million pounds in fiscal year 2008 to 2.4 million pounds in fiscal year 2010, according to a separate March 2011 GAO report. We were unable to find similar firearms figures.  

Further complicating the issue is that as of fiscal year 2011, Customs and Border Protection no longer reports data on its success detecting contraband, according to the March 2011 report.

Experts on counternarcotics told us they have no reason to doubt Napolitano’s claim. In recent years, the DHS has doubled the number of border patrol agents, installed technology that makes it easier to detect contraband and paid more attention to coordinating their efforts with Mexico.

Improving the border effort, however, did not require an exceptional effort, experts told us.  Previously, there was little emphasis on seizing illegal guns, noted Vanda Felbab-Brown, a fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.

""Yes, we are capturing more arms than ever because we now try for the first time; the baselines are extremely low,"" Felbab-Brown wrote PolitiFact Georgia in an email.

It’s also important to note that these increases in seizures are not proof DHS’ efforts are successful, said Eric L. Olson, a counternarcotics expert at the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. He said we need to know what percentage of contraband is being captured.  

If DHS drug seizures climbed 10 percent, but 100 percent more drugs are being smuggled across the border, that’s hardly a success.  

""They’re doing more things,"" Olson said of the DHS, ""but whether it is accomplishing anything is another question.""

That’s a question we may be unable to answer, he added. It’s extremely difficult to calculate the total amount of drugs entering the country.

To sum up:

The data DHS gave us is not enough to prove definitively that Napolitano’s claim that the agency has ""seized more currency, more drugs, more outbound arms in the past year than any year in our country’s history.""

We can say that seizures increased recently under the Obama administration, but they were so low in the past that the bump is not a major accomplishment. Also, the seized contraband is likely such a small percentage of what crosses the border that the increase’s impact on the illegal drug trade is slight.

By PolitiFact’s rules, the burden of proof is on the person who makes the claim. Since the Department of Homeland Security did not provide us with enough data to support her talking point, and the increase in seizures is not a clear-cut sign of border security success, we rate her claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB76840>],/factchecks/2011/jun/03/janet-napolitano/homeland-security-chief-says-more-contraband-being/

Wendy Davis says Texas not funding enrollment growth in public schools for the first time
","
The Democratic state senator whose filibuster kept lawmakers from advancing a plan determining how much schools will get in state aid in 2012-13 told colleagues she was standing up for history.

Sen. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth said the House-approved plan ""sets a new normal that says for the first time, we are not going to fund student population growth,"" according to a news article posted online May 30 by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

Davis opened her filibuster by saying the plan ""will mean the very first time ever in the history of funding public schools that we are not going to fund student population growth. Let me say that again. For the first time ever, we are not funding student population growth.""

Got it. But did she get the lack of precedent right?

First, some background: The 2012-13 state budget already sent to Gov. Rick Perry allocates $4 billion less in state funds than districts would get under existing funding formulas to accommodate enrollment growth .

According to a Legislative Budget Board summary, that reduced ""funding level assumes passage of legislation that adjusts school district and charter school payments to the level of available appropriations."" Put another way, the budget is premised on lawmakers divvying up per-student aid in amounts that overlook the state’s expectation that 170,000 additional students will be enrolled by the end of August 2013, according to a February background report on state budget issues by the House Research Organization.

Davis talked the share-the-pain proposal to death May 29, the day before the regular legislative session ended. Perry immediately called a 30-day special session on topics including the school aid changes.

And how did Davis conclude this is the first time enrollment increases aren’t covered?

Earlier this year, the senator asked budget board staff to look into ""whether or not the state has historically funded enrollment growth in the Foundation School Program,"" the state’s primary source for allocating money to Texas schools in an equitable manner.

Since 1984-85, the April 29 memo from LBB analyst Jennifer Schiess to Davis says, ""the state has appropriated sufficient funds to fully fund state obligations, including enrollment growth, under the school finance formulas in effect at the time of appropriation."" Davis’s office publicized the memo on May 3. 
The memo also states: ""This analysis should not be interpreted to imply that at any point prior to the 1984-85 biennium the state failed to meet this obligation. Data required for analysis going further back is simply not readily available for a timely response."" Anthony Spangler, Davis’s spokesman, told us that the staff did not follow up with deeper historical analysis. 
Separately, experts say school funding has depended in part on student enrollment counts at least since passage of the landmark Gilmer-Aikin laws of 1949 modernizing the school system and creating the Foundation School Program. Even before then--and continuing in 2012-13--the state sent an allotment of money per student from income earned on the state’s education endowment, the Permanent School Fund. The 2010-11 Available School Fund allotment is $455 per student, according to the Texas Education Agency.

Then again, a primer on Texas school finance revised by the Texas Association of School Boards in 1996 says that in earlier years--even back to 1854--state education aid was distributed on a ""per-capita"" basis. Meaning? Austin lobbyist Dan Casey, its author, told us in an interview that funding was connected to pupil counts. He pointed out that a 1925 book, ""The Development of Education in Texas,"" states that until lawmakers in 1903 offered more money for ""manual training"" classes, ""Texas had always adhered to the policy of distributing state educational funds on the per capita basis.""

Our sense? For the first time in more than 25 years, the budget approved by legislators does not fully account for enrollment increases. Prior to 1984, information to prove or disprove Davis' statement is more fuzzy, but it's clear that Texas has allocated education funding on a per-student basis since the 19th century. We rate Davis' statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBAB9C00>],/factchecks/2011/jun/03/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-texas-not-funding-enrollment-grow/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Regulation', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says U.S. is ""only inches away from ceasing to be a free market economy.”
","
In his June 2, 2011, presidential announcement at a farm in Stratham, N.H., Mitt Romney made a bold claim about the state of the American economy.

""Government under President Obama has grown to consume almost 40 percent of our economy,"" he said. ""We are only inches away from ceasing to be a free market economy.""
   
At PolitiFact, we tolerate a bit of hyperbole from politicians on all sides when they’re trying to make a point. But we think the underlying question -- whether the United States could really be approaching socialism -- is a fair one to analyze.

So we looked into the data and consulted an ideologically diverse group of economists and business experts. Our conclusion? Romney’s suggestion that the U.S. is in danger of losing its free market heritage is so far off base that it's ridiculous.
   
Here are some of the statistics to consider:
   
Government spending. On the suggestion of several economists, we took the figures for government expenditures (which includes all levels of government) and divided them by the national gross domestic product for the years 1996 through 2010. For more than a decade, government spending as a percentage of GDP was quite stable, bouncing between 30.4 percent and 32.9 percent.

For the last few years, that percentage has indeed gone up -- to roughly 38 percent in both 2009 and 2010, which is within striking distance of the 40 percent Romney cited. (His staff did not respond to an inquiry for this story.)
   
Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said that Romney is ""implying that the temporary increase in spending from (Obama’s stimulus bill) and the consequences of the recession are permanent,"" Bartlett said. Other economists noted that government’s footprint in GDP started growing in 2008 -- under Bush, not Obama -- because that’s when the recession began to hit.

And even if the government share of GDP is close to 40 percent, would that be a catastrophe for economic freedom? Most of the experts we spoke to scoffed at the suggestion.

""It has long been the conservative view that there is only so much freedom out there and if government grows in size then this necessarily diminishes freedom,"" Bartlett said. ""Thus if spending is 25 percent of GDP, then we are three-quarters free, and if it grows to 40 percent, then we have lost 15 percent of our freedom and are only 60 percent free. This, of course, is nonsense, because it implies that the greatest freedom exists in anarchy … and that freedom is the only thing anyone cares about.""
   
Here are a few other statistics to consider.
   
Taxes. Taxes offer another measure of government involvement into the economy. According to the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group that studies tax policy, the total federal, state and local tax burden has been falling -- not rising -- in recent years. Every year, the group computes a national figure for all levels of taxation as a share of national income. The data shows that the tax burden has fallen modestly in recent years, from 31.2 percent in 2006 to 27.2 percent in 2011.
   
And as we concluded recently, the U.S. tax burden isn’t just hovering around a historical low -- it’s also low compared to other advanced industrialized nations. In a 2006 international comparison, 25 nations had a higher percentage of taxes compared to GDP than the U.S., while just four -- Mexico, Japan, Korea and Turkey -- had a lower percentage.
   
Regulation. ""One loses being a free market economy not so much, or not solely, because of the level of spending and taxation, but also by the level and reach of government regulation, and by the distortions to choices that arise through government policy -- think of tax rules that discourage some behaviors and investments in favor of others,"" said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation.
   
Tevi Troy, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute, said that bailouts for Wall Street and U.S. automakers (approved under Bush and continued under Obama) and the increasing government oversight over the health care sector (approved under Obama) represent nearly unprecedented willingness by the government to intervene in the economy. (Supporters, of course, counter that all but the health care intervention were intended to be temporary and came in response to a dire situation.)
   
But the strongest evidence that undercuts Romney's claim comes from, of all places, the conservative Heritage Foundation.

Heritage published an economic freedom index for 2011 -- an international ranking of nations using a combination of 10 types of statistics, covering business freedom, trade freedom, fiscal freedom, government spending, monetary freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, property rights, freedom from corruption and labor freedom.
   
Certainly, different groups could measure freedom differently. But let’s look at what Heritage concluded.
   
The U.S. ranked ninth out of 179 nations on the list, with a score that placed it near the top of the ""mostly free"" category. The only nations to be considered more ""free"" than the U.S. were, in descending order, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, Ireland, and Denmark.
   
If the results of this study -- which, we’ll remind readers, was produced by a staunchly conservative think tank -- suggest that the U.S. is on the verge of socialism, then Lenin must be partying in his mauseoleum. For the U.S. to fall into the ""mostly unfree"" category, which is only the third-lowest category in the study, it would have to drop a whopping 83 slots, to a perch below such nations as Albania, Rwanda and Kazakhstan.
   
We did hear one argument that provided a measure of support for Romney’s position -- but only in a backhanded way.
   
Eugene Steuerle, an economist with the Urban Institute, a think tank that does economic and social policy research, said Romney’s comparison is imperfect because over the past century, there really hasn’t been a golden age in which the economy was genuinely unfettered, so the U.S. really couldn't be inching away from such an age.
   
""We’ve been a mixed economy for a long time,"" Steuerle said. ""The ‘free market’ is a somewhat vague term. Technically, a Federal Reserve system and an antitrust division of the Justice Department interfere with a totally free market economy, yet they may promote a competitive economy."" 
So where does this leave us? It’s true that the government’s footprint on spending has grown over the past few years, due in large part to the recession. But while the statistics show that the government continues to have a large influence on the economy, there is little indication that the government’s role has risen dramatically enough over the past few years to threaten the kind of free market that the U.S. has operated under in recent decades. And international comparisons show that the U.S. ranks low in both total tax burden and high in economic freedom -- at least as measured by a prominent conservative think tank. 
So, as measured by economists from both ends of the spectrum and, most importantly, from the conservative Heritage Foundation, it's ridiculously false to say we are close to losing our free-market economy. We find Romney's statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD7E180>],/factchecks/2011/jun/02/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-us-only-inches-away-ceasing-be-fr/

Illegal gator trapping vs. underage drinking parties
","
Some Florida parents throw boozy bashes for their teenage children when they graduate from high school under the premise that underage drinking at home is safer than drinking elsewhere. During the spring 2011 session, legislators sought to toughen the penalties for allowing underage drinking.

State Rep. Kathleen Passidomo, R-Naples, was among the legislators who voted in favor of the bill, which passed overwhelmingly. In a May 30, 2011, Naples Daily News article, she had a biting way of suggesting the penalty for the crime was too weak.

""It is a greater crime to have an untagged alligator than to host an open house party (for kids),"" she was quoted as saying.

She wasn't the first to make such a statement.

Rep. Tom Goodson, one of the bill's sponsors and a Republican from Rockledge, told Florida lawmakers: ""I think it's a little bit strange that we protect an alligator more than our children,"" according to a March 29 St. Petersburg Times article.

Goodson legislative assistant Amy Gregory said in an e-mail that Goodson was the first to use the gator comparison during his presentation to committees.

Both Passidomo and Goodson made their comments before the bill -- intended to go into effect July 1 -- has been signed. The House approved it 116-0 on April 29, and the Senate passed it 38-1 on May 3. The bill has not yet been sent to Gov. Rick Scott for his signature, according to his spokesman Lane Wright.

We wanted to check: Is the penalty more severe for having an untagged alligator than hosting an underage drinking party? And is that about to change?

Gator statutes

Florida Statute Sections 379.3751 and 379.3752 relate to requirements to take an alligator -- to capture, kill or process it -- and obtain a license. We interviewed two spokespersons at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission -- Officer Jorge Pino and Katie Purcell -- for some background on gator tagging.

According to the commission's website: ""Applicants who are awarded a permit must submit payment for two CITES tags and an Alligator Trapping License, or provide proof of possession of an Alligator Trapping License valid through the end of the alligator harvest season. A Florida hunting license is not required to participate in the statewide alligator hunt."" The tag -- which hunters must place on the gator -- allows officials to verify that the hunter obtained the proper permit.

State statute 379.409 states that anyone who illegally kills, possesses or captures an alligator faces a third-degree felony.

Why a felony?

""These animals were close to extinction in the early '70s,"" Pino said. ""Because of our efforts to try to bring back the species, we have been very successful. Some people may argue we have been too successful -- there is an abundance of alligators in the state of Florida. ... We need to protect Florida's natural resources.""

Open house party law

Now on to underage drinking: During the 2011 session, the Legislature amended statute 856.015 with House Bill 105. The staff analysis for that bill provides a summary of how the law would change: ""Section 856.015, F.S., states that a person in control of a residence who allows an open house party to take place commits a second-degree misdemeanor if they know a minor has possession of or consumed any alcoholic beverage or drug at their residence and the person fails to take responsible steps to prevent the possession or consumption of the alcoholic beverage or drug by the minor.

The bill also ""amends present law to make a second or subsequent violation ... a first-degree misdemeanor. This bill also provides that any violation ... which results in serious bodily injury or death, will be punishable by a first-degree misdemeanor.""

This means that before July 1, hosting an open house party for minors could lead to a second-degree misdemeanor. After the law was passed, it became a first-degree misdemeanor in some circumstances -- note that both are lesser crimes than the third-degree felony for gator violations.

Now let's compare the penalties: state statute 775.082 states that a third-degree felony is punishable by up to five years in prison. The second-degree misdemeanor carries jail time of up to 60 days, while for a first-degree misdemeanor, someone can land in jail for a year.

Sen. Thad Altman, R-Rockledge, one of the sponsors, said in an interview with PolitiFact that legislators debated increasing the penalty of the open house party law to a felony but met some resistance.

""Expanding the number of felonies is frowned upon'' by some legislators, he said. ""This is a very measured approach.... at least it's one step in the right direction. Hopefully we will save lives of some kids.""

Broward Public Defender Howard Finkelstein, a Democrat, said comparing the two laws is politically motivated. But he said most criminal laws come down to intent. When someone picks up a gun, points it at an animal and pulls the trigger, the person is intending to kill the animal.

""When you host -- no matter how poorly thought out -- a party of underage teenagers where there is drinking, it's clearly not the intent of the homeowner that they get drunk and kill someone,"" he said in an interview.

So illegal gator trapping can send someone to prison for five years while hosting an open house party can -- as of June -- send someone to jail for two months and, possibly after July 1, for a year.

Manslaughter charge? 
But wait -- we're not done yet. If a parent hosts an underage drinking party and one of the teens winds up dead, could the host be charged with manslaughter? That would be one way of imposing a much tougher penalty.

Prosecutors have tried the manslaughter route at least occasionally. But in the examples we found, they were not successful:

• In May 2010, a jury found Diane Santarelli, a 52-year-old St. Johns County mother, not guilty of manslaughter in the case of two teenagers who died in an alcohol-related car crash after leaving a party hosted by Santarelli and her daughter, according to a May 21, 2010, Florida Times-Union article. The mother was convicted of two lesser offenses: hosting an open house party and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

The article stated: ""To be found guilty of manslaughter, the judge instructed the jurors they must determine that she was culpably negligent. Prosecutors had to prove her behavior was gross and flagrant and showed reckless disregard for human life or safety, among other qualifying factors."" The article stated: ""It was Florida's first manslaughter case dealing with the death of someone underage after consuming alcohol at an open house party.""

• In 2002, a Miami-Dade grand jury declined to charge a couple with manslaughter after a teenager who attended a party at the couple's home later died in a car crash, according to a July 20, 2005, Miami Herald article. And a jury acquitted the man of the open-house party law. But in that case, there was conflicting testimony about how long the father was present during the party.

• The Florida Highway Patrol recommended manslaughter charges for an assistant baseball coach and his roommate for hosting a party in which teens drank hours before three died in a fatal Martin County car crash. But prosecutors said the evidence only supported misdemeanor charges, according to an Aug. 7, 2010, Palm Beach Post article.

"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Virginia', 'National Republican Congressional Committee']","
NRCC says Gerry Connolly maxed out U.S. debt
","
Uncle Sam is sitting on a $14.3 trillion credit card bill, better known as the federal debt.

Republicans and Democrats are squabbling about which party is to blame for the epic spending spree. The argument is part of a debate over how much -- or whether -- to raise the federal debt ceiling. The U.S. has hit its borrowing limit and the Treasury Department says the country could default on its loan payments if the limit is not raised by Aug. 2.

The National Republican Congressional Committee pins the blame for the mess on Rep. Gerry Connolly, who represents a Northern Virginia district, and his Democratic colleagues. He is among 60 House Democrats being targeted with similar attacks by the NRCC, which works to elect Republicans to the chamber.

""Gerry Connolly and his fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out,"" the NRCC said in a May 18 email and press release.

Was it really Connolly -- or even all the House Democrats -- who maxed out America’s credit card? Let’s take a look.

Connolly took office on Jan. 3, 2009 and narrowly won re-election in 2010. On the day he entered Congress, total federal debt stood at $10.63 trillion, according to the Treasury Department. On May 31 the debt stood at $14.34 trillion. That’s an increase of $3.72 trillion, or 35 percent, since Connolly became a Congressman.

So right away it’s apparent Connolly himself couldn’t have maxed out the credit card. He simply hasn’t been around long enough to do so.  

How did the nation pile up so much debt?

You might remember tax cuts championed by congressional Republicans and former President George W. Bush during happier budget times -- tax cuts that were extended in December for two years under Democratic President Barack Obama. While some economists say these were needed to give the economy a kick, they also meant less money came in from tax revenue.

Before the most recent extension, the Congressional Research Service said that the Bush tax cuts, with a 10-year price tag of $1 trillion, played a substantial role in the nation’s annual deficits. Some will argue that tax cuts can actually pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth, but PolitiFact has previously found that the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers say that tax cuts lead to revenues that are lower than they otherwise would have been – even if they spur some economic growth.

The Congressional Budget Office last year said extending all of them permanently, as many in the GOP would like, would cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years and increase deficits.

Then there’s the recent economic downturn, which also played a role. And the nation is still engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with billions of dollars flowing out to pay for them. Those began during the Bush years and continue under Obama.

The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that just two policies dating from the Bush Administration — tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — accounted for more than $500 billion of the deficit in 2009 ""and will account for $7 trillion in deficits in 2009 through 2019, including the associated debt-service costs.""

What do conservative economists say? Our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio asked Brian Riedl, the lead budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, what he thought of the CBPP analysis. He was blunt. ""Basically, their analysis fails basic statistics,"" he said in an email.

Riedl referred us to his own blog, in which he wrote, ""Imagine a basketball team that loses 100-98. It would make no sense to cherry-pick one single basket by their opponent and blame it for 100 percent of the loss – letting all other baskets scored off the hook. Yet that is essentially what CBPP is doing.""

Riedl’s broader point is that ""one could cherry-pick"" any number of spending or tax policies and blame them for the entire problem. ""CBPP chose to pick the tax cuts, wars, stimulus/bailouts, and economic downturn to equal the sum of the deficit. One could have just as easily singled out Social Security and Medicaid (combined cost: $13 trillion), Medicare and net interest costs ($13 trillion), or discretionary spending ($15 trillion) for blame. There is no mathematical reason to single out the programs CBPP selected while ignoring the other costs.""

Where does this leave us?

Each side is cherry-picking the numbers. The liberal think tank puts nearly all the blame on the wars, the tax cuts and the recession and its associated costs. The conservative think tank says the blame base is larger and involves entitlements as well as discretionary spending.

DNCC spokeswoman Haley Morris cited a 2009 PolitiFact item that noted that when Bush took office in 2001, the national debt was $5.73 trillion. When he left eight years later, it was $10.7 trillion. ""Pretty hard for GOP to argue about maxing out (the) credit card,"" she said.

Let’s review.

Yes, the nation’s debt has gone up rapidly during the two and a half years Gerry Connolly has been in office. Liberal economists blamed the big deficits on wars and tax cuts that were started under Bush, a Republican, but continued by Obama, a Democrat.

Connolly supported the stimulus bill in 2009 and the tax cut extension in December 2010, and he has backed other measures that added to the federal deficit. But two-thirds of the federal deficit already existed when Connolly came into office. Why should he be held responsible for that?

Going one step further, why should Democrats take the full hit? Republicans deserve blame here as well. The nation’s current financial situation is a rare bipartisan feat. At the same time, 35 percent of the nation’s debt has come during Connolly’s two-and-a-half years in Congress. We rate the NRCC’s attack Barely True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA2DAC0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/02/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-gerry-connolly-maxed-out-us-debt/

Steny Hoyer says George W. Bush inherited $5.6 trillion surplus from Bill Clinton
","
During an interview on the MSNBC show The Daily Rundown, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., addressed the previous day’s House vote to raise the debt ceiling.

Hoyer blamed Republicans for turning the vote -- which failed by a wide margin -- into a political game.

The ""premise"" of the debt ceiling vote, Hoyer said, ""was we have this debt because of President (Barack) Obama's policies. That's simply not true, and the world knows it's not true, and the Republicans know it's not true. We went from a $5.6 trillion surplus that George Bush inherited to over ... $11-plus trillion debt when George (W.) Bush left office. So to say it is Obama's debt and that the debt limit needs to be extended because of Obama is simply not true.""

A reader asked us to check Hoyer’s claim that the United States ""went from a $5.6 trillion surplus that George Bush inherited to over ... $11-plus-trillion debt when George Bush left office.""

Here’s the way we initially looked at it. We turned to a historical table published annually by the Office of Management and Budget. The table reports that during fiscal year 2001 -- which included much of Bush’s first year in office, and which was based on a budget assembled during the term of his Democratic predecessor, Bill Clinton -- there was a surplus of $128 billion. So Hoyer was right that there was a surplus, but it was only 2 percent of the amount Hoyer indicated it was.

Meanwhile, according to the Treasury Department, the level of debt when Bush left office on Jan. 20, 2009, was either $6.307 trillion (the amount of debt held by the public) or $10.627 trillion (the amount of publicly held debt plus debt held by the government, including the Social Security and Medicare trust funds). With the latter measure, Hoyer’s in the ballpark.

But when we spoke to Hoyer’s office, they said he was actually using a different yardstick for the first figure.

They said Hoyer was referring to the $5.61 trillion in surpluses that the Congressional Budget Office -- the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress -- had predicted in January 2001 would materialize over the next 10 years, based on the fiscal outlook at the end of Clinton’s tenure. (Hoyer’s office confirmed our conclusion about the second figure.)

The CBO number provides support for Hoyer’s claim, but we think that his failure to make clear that he was comparing a projected surplus to the deficit weaken his argument.

Given Hoyer’s wording -- that when Bush came into office he ""inherited"" a $5.6 trillion surplus, we think a viewer would assume that it’s both a tangible figure, and that it refers to a specific point in time. In reality, it’s neither. It’s a projection of future surpluses, and it’s a figure that covers a 10-year period. In fact, the final two years of those surpluses wouldn’t even fall within Bush’s two terms in office.

There is some merit in Hoyer’s larger point -- that Bush came into office with a rosy fiscal outlook and left with one that was far less so. And he’s pretty close when he says that Bush left an ""$11-plus trillion debt"" when he departed the Oval Office.

Still, Hoyer left out enough qualifiers -- that the number was a projection, and that it covered 10 years -- that we believe viewers would take away an exaggerated impression of the fiscal picture Bush inherited. So we’re giving Hoyer’s comment a rating of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7D8C80>],/factchecks/2011/jun/02/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-says-george-w-bush-inherited-56-trilli/
"['Education', 'Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Michael Rosen']","
Union leader says Wisconsin’s technical college graduates “have a higher employment rate and starting salaries” than four-year college graduates nationwide
","
As commencement ceremonies were held throughout Wisconsin in May 2011, an economics instructor delivered what might be startling news to graduates of four-year colleges:

""Wisconsin’s tech college grads have a higher employment rate and starting salaries than four-year grads.""

So read the headline on a May 19, 2011, blog posting from Michael Rosen, who teaches economics at Milwaukee Area Technical College. He is also president of the union that represents MATC teachers and other employees.

It might not be surprising if more technical college graduates than four-year graduates get jobs soon after finishing school.

But they get paid more, too?

Rosen’s blog post, essentially a news and opinion column, appeared on WisOpinion, a website run by WisPolitics.com, and was distributed to subscribers of the weekly WisOpinion e-newsletter. It was also picked up by other sites.

To back his statements, Rosen cited figures from two sources: 
The Wisconsin Technical College System’s 2010 Graduate Follow-up Report from April 2011. It reported results of a survey of 2010 graduates of Wisconsin’s 16 technical colleges. The 17,498 graduates surveyed by the various colleges, through mail and other ways, represented 68 percent of the graduates that year. 
A New York Times story about a May 2011 Rutgers University study. Rutgers surveyed online a nationally representative sample of 571 U.S. residents who graduated from a four-year college between 2006 and 2010. 
A note before we proceed: Although 68 percent of the tech college grads responded to the survey, they are not a scientific sample of all grads, which could skew the results. For example, unemployed grads would be undercounted if they were less likely to respond to the survey. In contrast, Rutgers said it used a nationally representative sample of people ages 22 to 29 and that its survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

Now, let’s grade both of Rosen’s claims.

Employment rate

Rosen claimed that Wisconsin technical college graduates have a higher employment rate than four-year college graduates nationally.

The Wisconsin technical colleges survey found that 88 percent of the grads who responded to the survey and who were in the labor force (as opposed to getting more schooling, for example) were employed within six months of finishing school.

However, the survey did not try to determine which of those were employed full time and which were employed part time, said Julie Tyznik, performance measurement coordinator for the state tech college system. Of those who were employed, 71 percent said they were in a job related to the training they received.  

The Rutgers national survey of four-year college graduates found that only 56 percent of the 2010 graduates had gotten a full-time job within about 10 or 11 months of graduation. (Like some of the tech college grads, some four-year grads went on to further schooling or didn’t enter the labor force for some other reason.) Of those who did get jobs, 70 percent worked in a field related to their studies.

So, the 88 percent employment figure for the tech college grads is higher than the 56 percent figure for the four-year grads -- but there are some apples and oranges involved in this comparison. Tech college grads were considered employed even if they worked only part time, while the four-year grad survey measured only full-time employment among 2010 grads.

More detail is available in the Rutgers study if all of the 2006 through 2010 grads are considered. In the full sample, 53 percent were employed full time, 12 percent part time, 3 percent were self-employed and 2 percent were in the military. That’s a total of 70 percent employed. Of the rest, 21 percent were in graduate school and 9 percent were unemployed.

Starting salary

Rosen claimed Wisconsin technical college graduates earn a higher starting salary than four-year college graduates nationally. He said the median starting salary was $31,198 for Wisconsin technical college graduates and $27,000 for four-year graduates nationally. (The median is the mid-point -- half of the salaries are below and half are above the mid-point.)

But on this claim, as academics like to say, more research is needed.

The $31,198 starting salary for 2010 Wisconsin tech college graduates applies only to those graduates who were employed full-time in occupations related to their training. In other words, the picture is skewed because the dollar amount doesn’t take into account the tech grads who weren’t working in their chosen fields or those working part time.

The Rutgers study found the median starting salary for all 2010 four-year grads surveyed was $27,000, the comparison Rosen cited.

But when the comparison was shifted to only those working in fields related to their studies, the salary was $35,000 for the four-year graduates who got their degrees between 2006 and 2010 -- nearly $4,000 more than the starting salary for the tech college grads.

(Rutgers professor Cliff Zukin, one of the authors of the Rutgers study, told us the survey sample was too small to generate a median starting salary for only the 2010 four-year graduates.)

Rosen agreed he was wrong on his second claim about starting pay. He argued that his larger point -- that Wisconsin technical grads do better coming out of school than four-year grads nationally -- is accurate because, in his view, more of them find work.

OK, let’s don those caps and gowns; we’re about to graduate from this little course.

Rosen said Wisconsin’s technical college graduates have a higher employment rate and starting salaries than four-year college graduates nationally. On the first claim, a direct comparison of 2010 grads can’t be made because a complete breakdown wasn’t available, but more 2010 tech college grads found work than the 2006 through 2010 four-year grads.  

On the second claim, Rosen admitted he was wrong.

We would also note that the tech college data comes from an unscientific survey and the four-year grads data was from a scientific survey. We don’t know how Rosen would score this all out on an economics quiz, but on our scale it rates a Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFD6A00>],/factchecks/2011/jun/02/michael-rosen/union-leader-says-wisconsins-technical-college-gra/

House Democrats say neighborhood schools are closing because of budget cuts
","
Urging fellow lawmakers to tap the state’s so-called rainy day fund to give more money to public schools, a press release distributed by the Texas House Democratic Caucus paints a gloomy picture of the future of education in Texas. 
""Make no mistake,"" says the May 18 statement, attributed to six House members, including caucus leader Jessica Farrar of Houston. ""Some neighborhood schools are closing. Pre-kindergarten for 100,000 kids, programs that teach kids music and art, Advanced Placement courses in math and science — they’re all under threat. Voting for a budget that leaves out the rainy day fund is a vote to kill these programs."" 
It’s been widely reported that school districts across the state have been making plans to lay off teachers, trim programs and take other measures in anticipation of expected cuts in state education aid. But are districts also shuttering campuses? 
Texas has more than 8,000 public schools. To our request for specifics on neighborhood school closures, the executive director of the caucus, Roger Garza, sent us a list of more than 90 schools categorized in various ways, including ""grade realignment,"" ""announced closure"" and ""possible closure/consolidation."" 
We sought clarification on some of the entries but received no response. And when we asked the Texas Education Agency for information on schools being closed, spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us that the agency’s database only shows actual — not anticipated — closures, which are typically reported to the state in the summer. ""That’s when I would expect any school closed for budget reasons to show up,"" she said. 
So we went ahead with our own research, combing through the list sent by the caucus, reading news reports and talking to school districts to find neighborhood schools that are being shuttered because of the coming reductions in state funding. We found seven in all: 
** Four elementary schools (serving a total of 1,300 students) in the Houston district. District spokesman Jason Spencer told us that because of proposed state budget cuts, the administration determined that these small schools could no longer afford to provide some key services — for example, have a librarian or a nurse — so they will not open in the fall, saving the district $1.6 million. 
The Democrats’ list of possible closures includes dozens of other Houston schools that are not facing imminent closure. That may be because in December, the district superintendent, Terry Grier, initiated a review of 66 underutilized campuses, all with low student enrollment. However, he ultimately recommended closing only the four schools. 
** An elementary school (490 students) in the Hutto district north of Austin. According to a March 23 Austin American-Statesman article, Superintendent Doug Killian said, ""Our hope was that if we closed the school and reduced our overhead, that we could keep more jobs overall."" District spokeswoman Emily Boswell told us that the closure of Veterans’ Hill Elementary will save the district $1 million next year. 
** An elementary school (500 students) in San Antonio’s Edgewood district. An April 19 San Antonio Express-News story describes the school board’s vote to shutter Coronado/Escobar Elementary as ""the first school closure in Bexar County related to anticipated state budget cuts."" In an April 18 story on KSAT-TV’s website, Superintendent Elizabeth Garza is quoted as saying: ""We had to come up with different options to cut our budget by about 10 percent."" The closure is projected to save $1.5 million in operating costs, district spokesman Maclovio Perez said. 
** An intermediate school (340 students) in the Cedar Hill district, southwest of Dallas. District Chief Financial Officer Mike McSwain told us that the school board voted to close Beltline Intermediate School because of the upcoming reductions in state funding, saving the district $550,000. 
We also identified four other schools — two in Abilene and two in Little Elm, north of Dallas — that are set to close. However, we did not include them on this list because officials from those districts told us that the closures were in the works before the districts began to plan for the state budget reductions. 
Finally, we found at least five other districts that have discussed shuttering schools to help solve their budget problems and either decided against it or have yet to make a final decision. Among them is the Austin school district, with more than a dozen campuses identified as ""possible"" closures on the caucus’s list. According to American-Statesman articles, district officials are now developing a proposal that will take into consideration a task force report recommending that nine schools be closed over the next several years. The school board is not expected to take action on closures until the fall. 
To the Truth-O-Meter: In their statement, the Democratic legislators indicated that some neighborhood schools would close as a result of state budget cuts. Guess that depends on your definition of ""some."" The House Democratic caucus sent us a list of more than 90 schools, but we could find only seven — out of thousands across the state — that will shut their doors because the Legislature is reducing education aid. 
We rate the Democrats’ statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE1F600>],/factchecks/2011/jun/02/texas-house-democratic-caucus/house-democrats-say-neighborhood-schools-are-closi/
"['Oregon', 'Housing', 'Sam Adams']","
Portland Mayor Sam Adams says that affordable housing is calculated citywide -- not district by district
","
A recent proposal to spend some $20 million to renovate the Memorial Coliseum would, according to the Portland Development Commission, draw private investment to Portland’s Rose Quarter.

It would also drive down the amount of money being spent on affordable housing in the Oregon Convention Center urban renewal district, which includes the Coliseum, to 16 percent -- 10 percentage points short of the city’s previously planned 26 percent.

It’s that last bit that got some attention in a recent article in The Oregonian, which asserted that the Coliseum upgrades ""would be funded by sidestepping Portland policy that a certain percent of urban renewal money be spent on affordable housing within specific districts.""

The same day the newspaper published the article, Mayor Sam Adams, who had included the Coliseum upgrades in his latest spending plan, pushed back.

""I raise this as we get into the general discussion because I think there's been some recent news coverage that would lead one to believe that the requirement was 30 percent in all districts,"" Adams said during a council meeting that night. ""It's a 30 percent citywide average. We specifically debated at that time the differences between the two. We knew that some districts would be more conducive, better cost benefit for subsidizing affordable housing expenditures, and others would be less.""

So is Adams right? PolitiFact Oregon delved into the historical record to find out.

The concept of setting aside a certain amount for affordable housing stretches back to a resolution passed by the Portland City Council on April 20, 2006. Back then, Adams -- along with three other council members, including the mayor at the time -- voted to pass Resolution No. 36403.

That resolution, in part, committed the council to establishing ""a policy to dedicate a percentage of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) revenues from all Urban Renewal Districts citywide to an affordable housing set aside fund.""

The resolution, however, didn’t specify what the policy should look like. It didn’t even specify the 30 percent figure.

For those details, we need to fast-forward a few months to October 2006. We also need to introduce another player in all of this: the Portland Development Commission. At the time all of this was being hashed out, the PDC set its own budget and was the final word in development issues. These days, the agency looks to the City Council for its budget, though it still maintains a certain amount of independence.

Anyhow, on Oct. 16, 2006, the PDC approved Resolution No. 6398 titled ""Adopting a tax increment financing for affordable housing policy and implementation plan to the City Council."" Appended to the resolution was an action plan for designing just such a policy. And in that action plan was this: ""policy will establish a requirement that a minimum of 30 percent of all tax increment resources averaged across all URA (urban renewal areas) …. be spent on Affordable Housing."" Now, that bit only applied to ""new districts,"" not the Convention Center. The policy addressed the Convention Center area specifically, stating ""PDC will establish policy for the Oregon Convention Center Urban Renewal Area to spend a minimum of 26 percent … on Affordable Housing.""

In any case, the big takeaway here is the phrase ""averaged across all URA,"" which would seem to back up Adams.

If only things had ended there.

While the Development Commission was doing its thing, on Oct, 25, 2006, the Portland City Council passed its own related ordinance that stated: ""It is the policy of the City of Portland that 30 percent of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) over the life of an Urban Renewal District shall be dedicated to the development, preservation and rehabilitation of housing affordable to households …""

That wording passed with yeas from all five council members -- including Adams.

Now, that ordinance isn’t super clear as to whether the policy was on a per-district basis or whether it was averaged. Thankfully, there’s some evidence to help us interpret the intent of the council at the time.

At the council meeting, then-Commissioner Erik Sten seemed to be under the impression that the City Council wanted a per-district commitment while the Development Commission had legislated a general 30 percent commitment. He wanted the two reconciled.

The same day, the Portland Development Commission amended its plan. The revised plan said: ""Policy will establish a requirement that a minimum of 30 percent of all tax increment resources in each URA … be spent on Affordable Housing."" Again, the plan put a 26 percent goal on the Convention Center separately.

See that? ""In each URA …""

About a year later, the Portland City Council took this plan and added it to its own ordinance calling it ""binding"" city policy.

That seemed like a closed case to us. But we called Adams’ office to see if we were missing anything. Here’s what Amy Ruiz, the mayor’s spokeswoman, had to say on the issue:

""We have a trio of City documents that all set city policy, and that all have slightly different wording on this topic, which makes it useful to look at the overall legislative history, including the council discussion when these votes were taken. Our city attorney's office did this, and notes that there is ‘clear legislative history to support the conclusion that the 30% policy was meant to apply citywide, and there were statements by Commissioner Sten opposite that.’

""Ultimately, as noted by the city attorney's office, these are all council policies. They are not state statutes. Where there's any ambiguity, it's up to the council to clarify if they want to. City policy is subject to change at any time by the council, while a state statute, as you know, is not.""

We asked her for a little more of the legislative history she mentioned given that the history we’d seen seemed to indicate the council was deliberate in asking for the ""in each URA"" language.

Ruiz referred back to the Oct. 18, 2006, meeting of the Portland City Council, specifically to the following remarks by PDC Chairman Mark Rosenbaum: ""In an unexpected circumstance, which we're not budgeted for at this point, in order to be true to our commitment of 30%, we would say, well [if we] didn't spend it in Lents, we'd have the opportunity to make up for it in the other four areas so we were consistent with our commitment. … We made it very clear that it is our policy to spend 30% in each district and only under an extreme circumstance would we vary and then if we did, we would be forced to make up for it elsewhere.""

If anything, though, that seemed to us to contradict the mayor’s statement that the policy was 30 percent averaged across the city. It does allow for that as a bare minimum in case of extenuating circumstances, but as far as we can tell, that doesn’t mean Adams was right when he said ""it’s a 30 percent citywide average.""

The evidence at the time seems to clearly indicate that the goal and the aspiration of both the City Council and the Development Commission was to set aside 30 percent in each district and 26 percent specifically in the Coliseum area. It’s also clear that the city officials knew there could be certain cases when that might be easier said than done and, as a result, gave themselves the cushion of 30 percent averaged across all districts.

But that cushion was not the rule -- it was the exception.

The PDC chairman’s statement sums it up: We'll try for 30 in each and if we absolutely can't, then we'll make it up elsewhere.

Adams, however, is asserting the the rule was always a 30 percent average. It’s within his right to go that direction, but it seems off-base to claim now that his rule was the rule along. The city attorney's office can tell him that what he wants to do is legal, but that's not the same as the historical intent.

We’ll rate this one False.

Pawlenty says half of Medicare paid for with deficit spending
","
In an appearance on ABC's This Week on May 29, 2011, Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty said the hard reality is that Medicare is ""going broke.""

Medicare, Pawlenty said, ""only has about 50 percent of it paid for by either premiums or payroll taxes, and the rest is deficit spending and debit spending, or debt spending. So we have to fix it.""

Medicare, which provides health care to about 50 million elderly or disabled Americans, is financed through a combination of funding streams: a Medicare payroll tax; general revenue (mostly from federal income taxes); premiums paid by Medicare users; and a tax on Social Security benefits and state payments toward the prescription drug benefit.

We'll go a little deeper in the weeds. The program is financed through two separate trust fund accounts: the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund and the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund. Medicare payroll taxes go to the HI trust fund, which is primarily used to pay for inpatient hospital stays (otherwise known as Medicare Part A). The SMI trust fund is used to pay for physicians visits, outpatient care and prescription drug benefits (Medicare Part B and Part D). The SMI trust fund is funded primarily (about 75 percent) through general revenue, with most of the rest coming from patient premiums.

Let's start with the first half of Pawlenty's statement, that ""only about 50 percent"" of Medicare is paid for by either premiums or payroll taxes.

According to the 2011 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds, Medicare expenditures came to $523 billion in 2010. Here's a breakdown of the revenue side of the equation:

• Payroll taxes, $182 billion
• Premiums, $61 billion
• Taxation of benefits, $13.8 billion
• General revenue, $205 billion
• Transfers from states for prescription drug benefits, $4 billion

If you break out premiums and payroll taxes, Pawlenty is correct that they covered about half the cost of Medicare in 2010.

Okay, but what about the second half of the statement, that the rest of Medicare expenses came from ""deficit spending ... or debt spending.""

Lisa Potetz of the Washington consulting group Health Policy Alternatives Inc. and co-author of a 22-page ""Primer on Medicare Financing"" in July 2009, said characterizing general revenue as ""deficit spending"" is misleading. Yes, she said, the government is spending more than it is taking in. But not all government spending is deficit spending. In order for Pawlenty's statement to be accurate, you’d have to assume only the deficit portion of the budget is used for Medicare. Using Pawlenty's logic, she said, you could instead put Medicare funding first and then say all of defense spending is deficit spending.

Potetz also believes Pawlenty's comment misleads because from its start in 1965, the Medicare program was set up to be partially funded by general revenue.

""His comment suggests that these things (payroll taxes and premiums) are supposed to pay for the program and aren’t doing their job,"" Potetz said. ""It was never the case that it was going to be entirely funded through payroll taxes and premiums. It's a little misleading to suggest something went awry.""

In fact, for years, the HI trust fund ran a surplus and was used to fund other parts of the federal budget. To the extent you consider that ""banked"" money, there was a balance of about $344 billion as of last year. In recent years, however, hospitalization and nursing home costs have outpaced the amount coming in from payroll taxes (a problem that is expected to get much worse in coming years as more baby boomers reach retirement age). As a result, the HI fund has been ""drawing down"" its surplus, and is expected to deplete it within several years. At that point, the gap between what's taken in from payroll taxes and the actual cost of hospitalization would have to be picked up by taxpayers.

The SMI trust fund -- again, the fund used to pay for physicians visits and prescription drugs -- was set up so that a portion is paid through patient premiums, but the majority is paid from the general revenue. Last year, the government paid $205 billion from general revenue into the fund.

Cost projections for that program are cause for alarm, but the financing of the program was always intended to come primarily from general revenue, Potetz said.

Medicare expert Marilyn Moon of the American Institutes for Research, an independent policy group, said a shift from hospital care to more outpatient care and physicians services has put a strain on the SMI fund, as has the prescription drug benefit added in 2006. But it's misleading to call general revenues put into the fund ""deficit spending,"" she said.

We asked Pawlenty spokesman Alex Conant for some backup for Pawlenty's statement, particularly that the amount not covered by payroll taxes and premiums comes from deficit spending.

Conant pointed us toward two sources.

The first was a Dec. 1, 2010, NPR interview with Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former head of the Congressional Budget Office (and former chief economic policy adviser to U.S. Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign) who said, ""If you look past the next eight to 10 years, Medicare is the deficit problem. And there's simply no way we can address our fiscal problems without coming to terms with Medicare's future.""

Conant also pointed to this warning from the 2011 annual report from the Medicare Board of Trustees:  ""The drawdown of Social Security and HI trust fund reserves and the general revenue transfers into SMI will result in mounting pressure on the federal budget. In fact, pressure is already evident. For the sixth consecutive year, a 'Medicare funding warning' is being triggered, signaling that projected non-dedicated sources of revenues -- primarily general revenues -- will soon account for more than 45 percent of Medicare’s outlays. That threshold was in fact breached for the first time in fiscal 2010.""

It's certainly true that the cost of Medicare is growing and that general revenue -- primarily from income taxes -- is shouldering a growing share of the load. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office concluded the exploding cost of Medicare and other entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Social Security had put the federal budget on an ""unsustainable fiscal path."" One could argue that added Medicare costs to a budget that is already running a deficit is simply adding on more deficit spending. But inasmuch as Medicare has always been supplemented by general revenues, we think it's a little misleading to characterize anything not paid by Medicare payroll taxes or patient premiums as deficit spending. And so we rate Pawlenty's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC662B00>],/factchecks/2011/jun/01/tim-pawlenty/pawlenty-says-half-medicare-deficit-spending/

Sarah Palin says Obama has accumulated more debt than previous 43 presidents combined
","
During a family bus trip, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin made a claim about the size of the debt accumulated under President Barack Obama.

""Look at the debt that has been accumulated in the last two years,"" Palin, a Republican, told Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren on May 31, 2011, as her bus rolled down the highway. ""It's more debt under this president than all those other presidents combined.""

This claim is similar to ones we’ve checked in the past -- with varying ratings -- so we thought we would check Palin’s as well.

A few preliminaries. First, there are two common measures for debt. One, called public debt, tallies up the debt held by the public, while gross federal debt is a larger figure that combines publicly held debt plus debt held by the government itself, such as in the Social Security or Medicare trust funds. Both figures are considered legitimate, and since Palin didn’t specify which one she was referring to, we’ll run the numbers for both categories of debt.

Second, we’ll assume that all the debt accumulated under Obama should be attributed to him. In reality, this isn’t a logical allocation, since the first budget he wrote was actually for the 2010 fiscal year, and because he -- like all presidents -- inherited the fiscal legacy of his predecessor.

Still, calculating it this way is much simpler -- and as we’ll see, it won’t matter to the outcome.

We turned to the Treasury Department’s ""Debt to the Penny"" calculator, where we found that on Obama’s first day in office, Jan. 20, 2009, the public debt stood at $6.307 trillion;  gross federal debt stood at $10.627 trillion. For the most recent date available -- May 27, 2011 -- these two debt figures stood at $9.718 trillion and $14.345 trillion, respectively.

That means that under Obama, the public debt rose by $3.411 trillion and the gross federal debt rose by $3.718 trillion. That’s a huge amount of money -- but it’s far less than what was accumulated by Obama’s 43 predecessors.

Because debt is cumulative (minus any intervening surpluses) the debt level for the previous 43 presidents is equal to the amount of debt on the day Obama was inaugurated. So even by the standards we used -- which aren’t especially favorable to Obama -- the debt he accumulated amounts to either 54 percent of his predecessors’ combined debt (using the public debt figure) or 35 percent (using gross federal debt).

Neither of these figures is ""more … than all those other presidents combined,"" as Palin had said.

Palin would have been correct if she had said the same thing that Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., said last fall, that ""the budget submitted by Obama will add more to the debt than the outstanding debt of the previous 43 presidents combined."" We rated that True.

In other words, Cantor didn’t use the two-year timeline that Palin did -- and making that change improves the accuracy of the claim.

But Palin didn’t say that. She said, quite specifically, that Obama had accumulated more debt in two years than the previous 43 presidents had collectively. And while Obama (along with Congress) has indeed accumulated a lot of debt for various reasons, his two-year debt total, even if you use the most generous standards for judging Palin’s comment, is still $3 trillion to $7 trillion short of the amount needed to make Palin’s statement accurate. So we rate her claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE22D80>],/factchecks/2011/jun/01/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-says-obama-has-accumulated-more-debt-p/

Chain email says 'more than 1,000 American soldiers have lost their lives in Afghanistan in the last 27 months'
","A reader recently sent us an email that had a meandering -- but strongly critical -- message of opposition to President Barack Obama. The email -- which can be read in its entirety here -- urges veterans and their families to vote in the 2014 midterm elections in order to send Obama a message. Here are excerpts: ""The President, the Commander in Chief, has made the Rules of Engagement (ROE) so difficult that our troops are often killed before they can even get permission to fight,"" the email says. ""Nothing has been done to stop our troops from being murdered by the Afghanis they are training, either. ... ""Interestingly enough, when (George W. Bush) was president, you heard about the military deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan almost daily. With Obama in the White House, the mainstream media has been strangely quiet.  ""More than 1,000 American soldiers have lost their lives in Afghanistan in the last 27 months. This is more than the combined total of the nine years before. Thirty have died in August. During the last month, over 50 additional NATO and US servicemen have been murdered, inside jobs by those who are hired to be a force for good in Afghanistan. ""The commander in chief is AWOL. Not a peep, although he ordered the White House flag flown at half-staff for the Sikhs that were killed. There is a deep disgust, a fury, growing in the ranks of the military against the indifferent incompetence of this president."" We will be checking a few claims from this email, but in this report, we’ll look at the claim that ""more than 1,000 American soldiers have lost their lives in Afghanistan in the last 27 months. This is more than the combined total of the nine years before."" To analyze this claim, we turned to iCasualties.org, which we have used before to calculate battlefield deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq. First, we looked at deaths over the most recent 27 months -- February 2012 to April 2014. Over that period, the total number of deaths for U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan was 427. The total for the nine years prior to that was 1,825. This makes the email clearly wrong. The 427 deaths is less than half the 1,000 claimed in the email. And the amount over the prior nine years was more than four times that number -- the opposite of what the email claimed. However, we think we know where the math came from. If the email was written in mid 2012, it would have been largely correct. Between June 2010 and August 2012, there were 1,020 American military fatalities. And in the nine years before that, there were 1,088. That’s close enough to be a reasonable estimate. (Further evidence in favor of this theory about when the email was written: In August 2012, there were 39 U.S. troops killed, not far from the email’s claim.) So at one time, the email was pretty close to accurate about the death statistics for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. However, its use of outdated numbers is problematic, since the email explicitly aims to persuade voters to send Obama a message in 2014. If you only rely on the information in the email, one would assume that U.S. military deaths in Afghanistan are spiraling out of control. In reality, the opposite is happening. After peaking in 2010 with 499 U.S. military deaths, the number has fallen to 418 in 2011, 310 in 2012, 127 in 2013 and 16 so far in 2014, which, if the current trend holds, would mean a falling number of deaths for the fourth consecutive year. In fact, in March 2014, there were zero deaths. So far in April 2014, there have been two. This is not surprising -- this is a war that Obama has pledged to wind down. (He hasn’t been entirely successful at achieving that yet; we have rated his promise to that effect In the Works.) Our ruling The chain email says that ""more than 1,000 American soldiers have lost their lives in Afghanistan in the last 27 months. This is more than the combined total of the nine years before."" This may have been accurate in mid 2012, but the statistics are now so out of date that the trend has actually reversed itself. U.S. military deaths in Afghanistan have been declining for the past four years. This matters because it contradicts the email’s dominant message -- that surging deaths in Afghanistan are a reason to vote against Obama’s Democratic allies in the 2014 midterm election. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBAFA1C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/24/chain-email/chain-email-says-more-1000-american-soldiers-have-/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Voting Record', 'Mike McFadden']","
GOP challenger says Al Franken voted to exempt himself from health care law
","Republican Mike McFadden claims his midterm opponent, incumbent Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., wanted to excuse himself from the health care reform’s requirement to buy insurance on the marketplace. ""What’s Minnesota gotten from Al Franken?"" the narrator asks in McFadden’s April 17 TV ad ""Miss,"" a $9,800 buy. In the background, a hockey player misses each shot he takes. ""Record spending, over 40 votes for higher taxes and Franken voted for Obamacare. Then voted to exempt himself and Congress from enrolling in it. For Minnesota, it was miss after miss after miss."" McFadden’s argument gets it wrong and hinges on a technicality. PolitiFact wanted to address the topic of a congressional exemption, one we’ve taken a look at already from other Republican lawmakers. How Congress gets its health plans  Prior to the Affordable Care Act, members of Congress chose their plans from the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. They had an employer subsidy, similar to the one an average American usually gets from a large employer. But as the health care reform was drafted, Republicans wanted to make sure Democratic members of Congress would get a taste of their own medicine, so to speak. McFadden’s office pointed us to a 2009 amendment to the Affordable Care Act proposed by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, that called for members of Congress to buy their insurance on the healthcare.gov marketplaces. Like most Democrats, Franken voted against that amendment. Around the same time, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., put forward a similar provision. The main difference was that Coburn’s didn’t indicate that legislators could put their employer-provided subsidies toward marketplace plans. Franken and other Democrats actually became sponsors on Coburn’s bill. When asked on the Senate floor if he was serious about purchasing insurance on the marketplace, Franken responded: ""I talked to my wife, Franni. We have been married 34 years now. I talked to her a couple of weeks ago. I said if this passed, we should do the public option. She said, 'Absolutely.' Yes, I am perfectly serious about this.'' The public option, envisioned as a government-backed insurance plan, didn’t make it into the final law. But Franken’s clear support of it shows he himself favored buying insurance under the new law. When Al Franken and 59 others voted to pass the Affordable Care Act, they approved the following text: ""Notwithstanding any other provision of law, after the effective date of this subtitle, the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are— (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act)."" In 2013, because Grassley’s exact wording hadn’t all been transferred to the law, there was confusion as to whether members of Congress would still receive their employer-provided subsidies when they switched plans. This is a special case, because most Americans who receive insurance from their employers were not affected by healthcare.gov’s launch. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management cleared things up in August 2013, a couple of months before the online marketplaces opened. They confirmed that legislators would be able to use their subsidies toward their marketplace premiums if they purchased through the District of Columbia’s marketplace. Franken purchased insurance using Minnesota’s state marketplace, MNsure, according to the Star Tribune. In doing so, he declined the employer subsidy the law allotted him and other legislators. Our ruling McFadden’s ad claimed Franken voted to exempt himself from enrolling in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The senator did vote against one amendment. However, he supported a different amendment that required Congress to buy marketplace insurance, and he clearly articulated his support for the idea on the Senate floor. Now he's buying his own insurance through the Minnesota exchange and voluntarily forgoing a subsidy. We rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB6F080>],/factchecks/2014/apr/24/mike-mcfadden/gop-challenger-says-al-franken-voted-exempt-himsel/

Texas lawmakers including Dan Branch tightened limit on late abortions in 2005
","Have Republican voters advanced a candidate for attorney general who tried to make abortion more accessible? Texas Right to Life said in a March 21, 2014, email blast about state Rep. Dan Branch of Dallas, ""In 2005, Branch tried to expand third-trimester abortions in Texas!"" The blast said the change ""would have endangered disabled, unborn babies."" Well, it was an amendment to an amended amendment, and it would have provided an exception to an abortion restriction that didn’t yet exist. Does that mean Branch ""tried to expand"" late-term abortions? Branch faces state Sen. Ken Paxton of McKinney in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the GOP nomination in the race to replace Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott. Backup: An amendment to an amendment By email, Texas Right to Life legislative director John Seago pointed us to an amendment Branch offered May 16, 2005, as the House was considering Senate Bill 419 to maintain the state medical regulatory agencies. From the front of the House chamber, Republican Rep. Will Hartnett of Dallas put forward an amendment to the state’s Occupations Code prohibiting third-trimester abortions ""when the abortion is not necessary to prevent the death of the woman."" Hartnett’s move--which won legislative approval and the backing of Republicans including Branch--amounted to a tightening of the existing state law, which barred third-trimester abortions unless the physician performing the abortion found the action ""necessary to prevent the death or a substantial risk of serious impairment to the physical or mental health of the woman; or the fetus has a severe and irreversible abnormality, identified by reliable diagnostic procedures."" (That law was left in place, however, though the new restrictions superseded the old language due to a long-time legal provision stating that when laws are irreconciliable with one another, the law of more recent enactment prevails.) During House consideration of his proposal, Hartnett amended it to bar third-trimester abortions if ""the viable unborn child does not have a severe, irreversible brain impairment."" Branch then proposed adding ""or vital organ"" after ""brain:""  Recapping: Hartnett’s amended amendment would allow late abortions if a ""viable unborn child"" had irreversible brain damage. Branch’s amendment, which Hartnett opposed, would have added another exception, allowing third-trimester abortions if the viable unborn child had irreversible damage to vital organs. Branch offers rationale not mentioned in '05 debate We sought to interview Branch about why he offered his amendment. Branch campaign spokesman Enrique Marquez told us via email that Branch ""was concerned that, by focusing arbitrarily on the brain, to the exclusion of the heart or lungs, the Legislature might give a court an excuse to question the rational basis of the law."" Branch didn’t explicitly mention potential court concerns in the House floor debate, according to the House’s archived online video (debate on Branch’s amendment starts at the 2:08:11 mark). But he repeatedly said it was rational to roll in irreversible vital organ damage if Hartnett’s amendment already specified irreversible brain damage as an exception. Branch said, ""What this is merely attempting to do is to be intellectually honest with the fact that there are other vital organs besides the brain in a third-trimester fetus. That’s all I’m trying to do."" Branch, saying he was ""strongly opposed as a general matter to third-trimester abortions,"" told the House, ""If you’re going to have this exception for severe, irreversible brain damage, then my point is, as a son of a neurosurgeon, as a brother of a neurosurgeon, as someone who’s lived through this with multiple children and multiple miscarriages, the term ‘or vital organ’ merely says that the heart -- it acknowledges that the heart or the lack of lungs or the kidney or the liver are all also vital organs in addition to the brain."" Branch in debate: 'Pro-life position' After about 40 minutes of debate on his proposal, Branch said, ""I hope you understand I’m coming from this in a pro-life position; I’m really just trying to be careful and precise and intellectually honest. If we’re going to make this exception for the brain, then we ought to include absolutely essential organs."" Hartnett, moving to table Branch’s proposal, told House members that ""vital organ"" was too broad: ""I just think ... we’re getting into the posture of trying to water it down by drip, drip, erosion,"" he said. ""You can live without a kidney is my understanding, you can live without a lung, you can live without just about anything except your brain, and that’s why we’re drawing the line at the brain."" The House tabled Branch’s amendment before voting to adopt the Hartnett amendment and another that Hartnett offered requiring girls under age 18 to have a parent's permission before getting an abortion. In the end, both Hartnett measures were regarded as tightening abortion restrictions. News stories from May 17, 2005, described the amendments as abortion limits, including a Fort Worth Star-Telegram story that quoted Hartnett as saying, ""It's important for our (abortion laws) to be drawn tighter, rather than broader, to protect the children and to give these children an opportunity to be born."" So Hartnett’s measure tightened abortion limits; Branch’s amendment would have added a second exception to one of them.   Groups diverge Returning to the present day: In the Texas Right to Life email, Texas Eagle Forum leader Cathie Adams and state Rep. Jodie Laubenberg, R-Parker, author of abortion restrictions that the Republican-led 2013 Legislature approved, are quoted as saying Branch's amendment would have expanded access to abortion. On the other hand, Joe Pojman, executive director of Austin-based anti-abortion group Texas Alliance for Life (which endorsed Branch on April 11, 2014), told us by email that his organization regards it as ""as highly misleading and disingenuous"" to say Branch tried to expand late-term abortions. Pojman said neither Hartnett’s fetal brain-damage exception nor Branch’s vital-organ exception would have expanded third-trimester abortions because the existing restrictions -- which lawmakers left in place -- didn’t significantly limit late abortions. ""Third-trimester abortions were effectively legal in Texas in 2005"" because of the mother’s-mental-health clause, he said. Our ruling Texas Right to Life said, ""In 2005, Dan Branch tried to expand third-trimester abortions in Texas."" TThis statement would hold up if Branch's amendment loosened established limits. To the contrary, lawmakers including Branch embraced specific restrictions superseding a broad limit stating that any fetus with a severe, irreversible abnormality could be aborted in the third trimester. If Branch's proposal had been adopted, such abortions could have taken place if a fetus had a severe irreversible impairment to the brain or--Branch’s wrinkle--another vital organ. The bottom line is Branch’s proposal would have restricted such abortions more than they'd been limited, which makes this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Charlie Crist portrays his view on abortion as consistent
","As Charlie Crist has been attacked for flip-flopping on an array of issues, he argued during an April 20 TV interview that one topic he has been consistent on is abortion. While Crist enthusiastically admitted he changed his view on gay marriage and now supports it, he argued with interviewer Michael Williams of WPTV about whether he changed his views on abortion. Williams: ""In the heat of the campaign you were once quoted ‘listen I’m pro-life, I’m pro-gun,’ on and on and on. You changed your view on abortion as well."" Crist: ""That’s not true. No. I am pro-life -- by my definition."" Williams: ""But you changed your mind on abortion restrictions in the state of Florida. That’s a matter of record...."" Crist: ""I am pro-life. And what I mean by that is I am for life. I think most of us are for life. And I think that’s very important to state because even though I am pro-life, which I mean for life, (it) doesn’t mean that I want to tell a woman what to do with her body, and I never have. Even as a Republican governor I vetoed the ultrasound bill on women ... "" Williams: ""The ultrasound bill, yes, but on the larger issue in the prior incarnation politically of Charlie Crist, you supported abortion restrictions outside of the ultrasound bill. That's a matter of record. You have changed the nuance or your view there."" Crist: ""No, I haven’t. That’s not true."" Crist then said he voted against a bill for a waiting period for women who wanted an abortion when he was a state senator in the 1990s. A couple of days later, at a meeting of the Capital Tiger Bay Club in Tallahassee, Crist repeated, ""I also don’t want to tell any woman what to do with her body. I never have."" Crist’s comments left viewers with the impression that he hasn't changed his views on abortion restrictions. But does his record back that up? Crist on abortion in the 1990s and 2006 race We’ve been tracking Crist’s views on abortion for some time now. Overall, he’s been all over the map on the issue, calling himself both ""pro-choice"" and ""pro-life"" in the past. In 1992, when he ran for the state Legislature, Crist said he was ""pro-choice"" but opposed state-funded abortion. Crist won that race. In 1995, Crist was a Republican state senator from St. Petersburg serving on a Senate health care committee. As he mentioned in the recent interview, Crist voted against a bill that would have required a 24-hour waiting period for women to obtain an abortion. The 3-3 vote meant that the bill failed. ""I generally don't like the government telling people what to do,"" Crist said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. ""I believe in individual rights and freedom. That's why I'm a Republican."" But in 1996, the health care committee approved a waiting period bill on a 5-3 vote, after an amendment offered by Crist to restrict the bill to women younger than 18. News reports at the time said Crist favored abortion rights but wanted minors to be adequately counseled. The bill failed in the House. In March 1998, Crist took a position against abortion when he voted to override Gov. Lawton Chiles’ veto of a bill that banned what opponents call a ""partial birth"" abortion, a late-term procedure. The House and Senate successfully overrode the veto. When he was running for the U.S. Senate for the first time in 1998, Crist said in a questionnaire for the Times: ""I am pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government."" When debating his Democratic opponent, incumbent Sen. Bob Graham, Crist was asked if he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortion. ""No, I would not,"" Crist said. ""I think this is a very personal decision. And I think it is a decision that a woman should make and have the right to make after consulting with her family, her physician and her clergy but not her government."" During Crist’s 2006 race for governor he again reiterated, ""I don't think that politicians ought to put themselves in the place of physicians."" However, he also told a priest in Pensacola that he would sign a bill outlawing abortions except when the mother’s life was at stake. But then he told an AP reporter that he would only sign such a bill if it included exceptions for rape and incest. As Crist and then CFO Tom Gallagher competed in a Republican primary, Crist launched an attack ad calling Gallagher ""pro-choice"" and referring to himself as ""pro-life."" Later, in the general election debate against Democrat Jim Davis, Crist said: ""I'm pro-life on this issue, but I also understand that it's very important to respect the views of others, and I do,""' Crist said. ""I don't think it's important to change the law. What I do believe is important is that we change hearts and not the law. . . . I'm pro-life and I'm proud of it, but I don't think that I should impose my will on other people as a result of it."" Crist on abortion 2010-14 In January 2010, Crist’s Republican U.S. Senate campaign released a statement saying he would ""fight for pro-life legislative efforts."" In April, as he lagged in a primary against Marco Rubio, Crist left the Republican Party to become a ""no-party affiliation"" candidate. Weeks later, he vetoed a bill that would have required women seeking abortions to get an ultrasound. He said he found the requirement that women pay for the procedure ""punitive"" and that the measure was ""almost mean-spirited."" Crist lost the Senate race in 2010 and left the governor’s office in January 2011. In November, he announced he would challenge Republican Gov. Rick Scott as a Democrat. Crist spokesman Kevin Cate told PolitiFact that ""Charlie Crist doesn't believe it's government's role to tell women what they can or can't do with their own bodies. That's always been his position and always will be."" On his campaign website, Crist states: ""Charlie supports a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions — as Governor, he vetoed a measure that required women seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound, a law that Rick Scott signed. Charlie believes that government should stay out of personal health decisions between a woman and her doctor."" Our ruling Crist said in a TV interview that he hasn’t changed his view on abortion restrictions. We find that misleading -- unless you're talking about having views that have always been difficult to pin down. Even before he switched parties, Crist voted both for and against abortion restrictions: In the 1990s, he opposed a waiting period for adults but also backed restrictions that included a waiting period for minors and a ban on partial birth abortion. In 2010, he vetoed a bill to require women to undergo ultrasounds before they have an abortion. He's also called himself both ""pro-life"" and ""pro-choice,"" and he seems comfortable offering up his own personal definitions of the terms. If he's shown a kernel of consistency, it's that he often -- but not always -- talked about being personally ""pro-life"" but wanting to respect the right of women to make decisions with their doctors and without government interference. Interestingly, this is not a case of a politician changing his stance after switching parties. Crist has always been all over the map on abortion. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDD08C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/24/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-portrays-his-view-abortion-consisten/

Austin rail line costs more than two times initial estimate; service hours up too
","When it comes to proposed passenger rail, KOKE-FM talk host Bob Cole of Austin said recently, ""Austin has been just like every other city in the country: The facts and figures they give you to sell it are far from the truth."" Take the MetroRail commuter trains that Austin transit agency Capital Metro started running from Leander to downtown in 2010. Cole said on his March 31, 2014, morning show, ""They told us that the annual amount to operate this thing’s going to be about $2.5 million. Last year ... it cost $13 million to operate it."" Is the 32-mile Red Line costing five times more than expected? Worth bearing in mind: As we noted in a 2012 fact-check, the commuter train isn’t supposed to pay for itself; it’s considered a public service. Capital Metro opened the diesel-powered MetroRail service to passengers in March 2010, has expanded it somewhat and plans a major overhaul to provide more capacity -- the trains are mostly packed during rush hour, as we explored in a 2013 fact-check. Also, MetroRail is separate from a proposed electric-powered urban passenger rail line, decades in the making, that the City of Austin might take to voters in November 2014 for authorization of several hundred million dollars in bonds. Cole's backup information Big electric-rail proposals like that, Cole told us by phone, are why he initially supported MetroRail, a smaller diesel-train project on existing freight track -- as a less-costly way to test the waters. He was later dismayed, he said, to see MetroRail’s costs exceed Capital Metro’s initial predictions. Cole told us he drew his dollar amounts from memory, having tracked the project since before voters approved it in November 2004. Capital Metro cost calculations We found no instances of Capital Metro giving a $2.5 million annual operating costs figure, or any estimate other than $5 million, in 2004. Then again, that $5 million estimate included $3 million a year for lease-purchase of the required rail cars. By phone and email, Capital Metro spokeswoman Francine Pares told us something surprising: The 2004 estimate solely covered the expected cost of a rail contractor, including service delivery, dispatching, supervision, vehicle maintenance and right-of-way maintenance. She said the estimate left out costs including ""fuel, track maintenance, bridge maintenance, signal maintenance, communication system maintenance, signal crossing maintenance, inspections"" and ""administrative costs."" The ""full system had not been designed yet, so no estimates could be made as to how the full system would be built out,"" Pares wrote. Pares stressed, too, the estimate emerged six years before trains started running and before how often trains run was stepped up. A timeline she provided indicated the trains, originally penciled in to have 5,100 service hours a year, are projected to exceed 14,200 service hours in the fiscal year through September 2014. ""Operating costs have increased as the inflation, labor, fuel and service hours have increased each year,"" she said. Before voters acted in 2004, Capital Metro issued an estimate of likely operating costs without specifying what the estimate left out: From August 2004 Capital Metro presentation:  Accounting for rail cars About the rail cars: Before the November 2004 vote, an Aug. 17, 2004, Austin American-Statesman news story reported details of the final recommended version of the $60 million plan. On operating costs, the story said, ""Not included in the $60 million is the upfront cost of the six self-propelled hybrid-diesel rail cars the agency thinks it would need initially to provide rush-hour service at 30-minute intervals when the line opens in 2007 or 2008. Those cars would probably cost about $3 million a year for a lease-purchase. Even including that lease cost, Capital Metro estimates initial annual operating costs of $5 million,"" the story said. That $5 million in 2004, adjusting for inflation, projects out to $5.8 million in 2010 dollars and $6.2 million in 2013 dollars. But after the 2004 vote, Capital Metro decided to buy the train cars instead of leasing to own and took out a loan in 2006 for the purchase. Statesman news stories in 2008 and 2011 said the agency was spending $4.4 million a year in debt payments on the loan (comparable to the $3 million annual lease-purchase payments projected in 2004). Cole said that because of that change, ""they no longer include the train cost in operating (costs),"" and the figures of $2.5 million and $13 million that he gave on the air were operating costs that excluded the lease or purchase costs of the train cars. If he’d included the car payments, Cole said, he’d have been able to say annual operating costs went from a projected $5 million to actual $15 million. MetroRail costs from 2011 on Costs have gone up, Capital Metro's Pares said, as have service hours. By email, she sent figures from fiscal 2011 -- the line’s first full fiscal year of service, ending Sept. 30, 2011 -- through the actual costs for 2013 and the projected amount budgeted for fiscal 2014: 2011: 10,731 train service hours. Direct operating costs $9.1 million; principal and interest payments on train car loan $4.4 million; total $13.5 million. 2012: 11,502 train service hours. Direct operating costs $10.3 million; principal and interest payments on train car loan $1.7 million; total $12 million. 2013: 11,466 train service hours. Actual operating expenses $10.5 million; principal and interest payments on train car loan $2.9 million; total $13.4 million. (Direct operating costs were still being finalized, Pares said.) 2014: 14,100 train projected service hours. Operating budget $12.6 million; principal and interest payments on train car loan $2.9 million; total $15.5 million. So, with the car lease or loan payments included, Capital Metro originally estimated $5 million operating costs, which projects out to $6.2 million in 2013 dollars. The agency ultimately spent $13.4 million to operate the line and make debt payments on the rail cars in 2013. Excluding the car payments, 2004’s estimate was $2 million (equal to $2.5 million in 2013 dollars) and 2013’s costs were $10.5 million. Some context: In an April 22, 2010, news story, the Statesman reported that a Texas Sunset Advisory Commission report found mismanagement at Capital Metro, including poor planning that caused MetroRail to cost $140 million plus $8 million in loan interest on the cars. MetroRail’s financial picture subsequently improved. In December 2011, the agency reduced its car payments by refinancing the loan, and a Feb. 3, 2013, Statesman news story said that, thanks largely to a $9 million federal grant, ""the commuter line is much closer to covering its $14.5 million annual operating cost than in its first two years."" Our ruling According to Cole, Capital Metro originally said MetroRail annual operating costs ""would be about $2.5 million. … last year, it cost $13 million to operate."" He’s correct, even conservative, on the 2013 costs. But Cole understates MetroRail’s initial projected operating costs of $5 million, or $6.2 million in 2013 dollars, which Capital Metro told us didn’t roll in fuel and other costs. The rail line’s 2013 operating costs, including payments on the rail-car loan, were about $13 million--more than double the inflation-adjusted 2004 estimate, perhaps in part due to trains having more service hours than initially envisioned. We rate Cole’s statement as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Do Americans pay more in taxes than in food, clothing and housing?
","With the April 15 tax deadline a fresh memory, Americans have seen an uptick in social media posts about taxes. One reader saw a Facebook post and forwarded it to us, asking whether it was accurate. ""Americans will spend more on taxes in 2014 than they will on food, clothing and housing combined,"" the post said, and it included a chart showing that the combination of state, local and federal taxes exceeded the amount spent on food, clothing and housing. The post was credited to the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally has a pro-business leaning. The claim sounded familiar to us -- in 2011, we checked a statement by Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus that ""Americans will pay more in taxes in 2011 than they will spend on groceries, clothing and shelter combined."" We rated that claim Half True. Experts told us that our previous analysis was generally applicable to the new claim as well, but it’s been three years since we checked it -- and the claim is still circulating on social media -- we thought it would be worth taking a second crack at it. First, we’ll note that no one knows for sure how Americans will allocate their money in 2014, since more than half the year hasn’t happened yet. The best we can do is extrapolate from previous years. Given the data available, the last year for which we can do it fully is 2013. We began our analysis by measuring expenditures on groceries, clothing and shelter. For this, we turned to the same source the Tax Foundation did -- the Bureau of Economic Analysis, an office within the U.S. Commerce Department. In a data series known as National Income and Product Accounts, the bureau tracks how Americans spend their income. For 2013, Americans spent more than $884 billion on food and beverages consumed at home, and an additional $737 billion on restaurant meals and beverages. For clothing, the figure was $363 billion, and for housing and utilities, it was $2.083 trillion. Total expenditures: $4.067 trillion. For taxes paid, we also turned to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The amount of federal taxes collected in 2013 was $3.041 trillion, and the amount of state and local taxes collected in 2013 (minus transfer payments from the federal government to the states) was $1.54 trillion. Combined, that’s $4.581 trillion. This makes the Tax Foundation correct in saying that the aggregate amount of taxes paid exceeds the aggregate amount spent on food, clothing and housing. It’s possible to quibble with both sides of this comparison -- the tax figure includes corporate taxes, while the expenditures side includes such items as alcoholic beverages -- but generally speaking, the tax figure is modestly higher than the expenditures on food, clothing and housing, giving the claim a solid grounding in the numbers. (We should note that taking out corporate taxes doesn't make much of a difference; taxes on individuals alone would still outstrip the other category.) This is not the only way to calculate it, however. While the Tax Foundation’s method shows that Americans as a whole pay more for taxes than for food, clothing and shelter, there are wide variations in what individual Americans pay. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, taxpayers in the aggregate spent 3.2 percent of their consumption on clothing, 14.1 percent on groceries and restaurants, and 18.1 percent on housing and utilities. Combined, that’s a little over 35 percent of individual income. Because our tax system is progressive, people with lower incomes typically don’t pay 35 percent of their income in taxes. According to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, American households earning under $200,000 a year don’t pay more than 20 percent of their cash income in federal taxes. The rate rises to 31 percent for those earning more than $1 million a year. Once you add in state and local taxes, Americans $200,000 and up may well see 35 percent or more of their income going to taxes, depending on the state and locality where they live. But for those near the bottom of the income scale, the tax burden is much lower. The federal tax burden doesn’t hit double digits until $30,000 in household income, and for those earning between $75,000 and $100,000, the rate is a bit over 17 percent. Even adding in state and local taxes, most taxpayers in these categories are not going to be paying 35 percent of their income in taxes. And remember that there are two parts to this equation. While Americans on average pay 35 percent of their income for food, clothing and housing, some pay more than that, and some pay less. We couldn’t find statistics on consumption patterns for different income classes. But generally speaking, the poorer you are, the higher a share of your income you’ll pay for these basics of life, and the richer you are, the smaller a share of your income will go to food, clothing and housing. So richer Americans may well pay 35 percent of their income in taxes even as they pay a much smaller fraction on food, clothing and housing. For these people, the Tax Foundation’s claim is correct. But poorer Americans will tend to pay a far higher share of their income for food, clothing and housing, and they won’t pay very much in taxes. For them, the foundation’s claim isn’t true in many cases. It’s hard to say whether the Tax Foundation’s claim is true more often than not, but there’s reason to think it may not be true in most cases. That’s because, according to the Tax Policy Center, upper-income groups account for a smaller share of the population. Households earning $114,484 or more -- a group that includes households most likely to pay more in taxes than in the three basic necessities -- account for just one-fifth of the population. By contrast, households earning less than $66,998 -- which include many households that will pay more for the necessities than for taxes -- account for 60 percent of the population. This doesn’t mean that the Tax Foundation calculation doesn’t have value. ""We are very clear that America as a whole -- not the average American -- pays more in taxes than food, clothing, and housing combined,"" said Tax Foundation economist Kyle Pomerleau. ""We are giving Americans a vivid illustration of what the total cost of government is. We hope taxpayers ask: Are the services we receive as a nation worth $4.5 trillion."" Still, Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said the numbers should be taken with a big grain of salt. ""I don't doubt the aggregate numbers cited, but those numbers say little about what happens to particular people,"" Williams said. Our ruling The Tax Foundation post said that ""Americans will spend more on taxes in 2014 than they will on food, clothing and housing combined."" While a minority of Americans probably does pay more for taxes, the numbers suggest that there are many more Americans whose food, clothing and shelter expenses exceed their tax burden.

"['Campaign Finance', 'PunditFact', 'Doonesbury']","
Doonesbury says Koch brothers outspent unions 3-1
","The billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, have become titans of money in politics. The two personally have given over $3.2 million to federal candidates and parties over the past 15 years. But that sum represents just a sliver of their ability to bring cash to bear. By one count, they spent over $400 million during the 2012 elections alone through a series of affiliated and hard-to-track groups. This Sunday, the comic strip Doonesbury took aim at brothers Charles and David. The character Kim bemoaned the impact of the Supreme Court on campaign money. ""You know, the Roberts court really did screw us over with Citizens United,"" she said to Mike Doonesbury, speaking about the U.S. Supreme Court and a decision that allows corporations and unions to contribute unlimited amounts of money to political campaigns. ""Last election cycle, a pair of nasty billionaires spent three times what the top 10 unions spent combined."" ""You mean David and Charles Koch? The respected civic-minded job-creators?"" asked Mike. It might be a comic strip, but Doonesbury certainly reaches plenty of eyeballs. And in this case, the claim is no laugher. We can fact-check whether the Koch brothers themselves spent three times as much as the top 10 unions in the last election. We asked Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau where he got his numbers, and he pointed us to a couple of articles. One from the Huffington Post tied the two men to a total of $490 million. The other from Republic Report, a liberal investigative project, found that the top 10 unions (based on their donations) accounted for $153 million. That’s actually a little more than a 3 to 1 difference. ""I rounded it in Kochs’ favor for rhetorical purposes,"" Trudeau said. But the numbers aren’t so simple. In fact, after talking to independent experts, we could not find an apples-to-apples comparison that included all the Koch brothers’ spending and all the union spending that ranges from local to federal races, and from supporting a candidate to supporting a cause. A limited comparison is possible, and we’ll get to that in a bit, but when it comes to tracking Koch money, the two brothers have set up a Byzantine network of nonprofits that make it impossible to know how much of their own money they have put into the game. The Koch brothers' spending We can say for sure that the $490 million Trudeau cited came from more people than just Charles and David Koch. It included campaign contributions from Koch Industries political action committees and from Koch Industries employees. In fact, the article itself doesn’t contend that all the money came from the Kochs. It called it part of the ""Koch network."" ""I saw that claim in Doonesbury and was surprised by it,"" Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a University of Notre Dame Law School professor who studies political nonprofits, told us. ""Trudeau may have mistakenly overestimated the amount attributable to the Koch brothers."" Mayer noted that financial records show that at least $39 million spent by the Koch-affiliated group Americans for Prosperity came from donors other than the Kochs. The biggest share, $407 million, came from the Koch’s unusual network of nonprofits. This network has been the focus of intensive research. The Washington Post and the Center for Responsive Politics, a group that tracks money in politics, sifted through 17,000 tax records to piece together how the Koch network deploys its funds. Its signature method is to create what are called ""disregarded entities."" These are nonprofits that totally mask the people behind them. Robert Maguire is the center’s lead investigator. ""We haven’t found a network of organizations like this anywhere else,"" Maguire said. ""The Koch brothers have mobilized this money and the amount is incomparable, even relative to other conservative funding organizations."" Maguire and the nonprofit investigative journalism organization ProPublica have documented how the legal structure of this network allows the Koch brothers to exercise a great deal of control over how this money is spent. The Kochs organize regular meetings where they invite donors who share their policy goals to join with them in common purpose. Managers and lawyers with strong ties to the Kochs play a key role in running this network. But so far, the corporate veil remains impenetrable. That means while the Kochs control the purse strings, the money doesn’t all come out of their pocket. ""We have no idea how much of the money comes from the Kochs,"" Maguire said. The union spending There are difficulties, too, in trying to calculate spending by unions. We found a variety of totals for union political spending, although only the one cited by Trudeau exclusively tallied up the activities of the top 10. Remember, Doonesbury compared the Kochs to that smaller group. One of the problems is the national unions give money, but so do their local affiliates. Some of that spending is on candidates and parties, and some is on lobbying. A comparable analysis on the Koch Industries side would include similar spending by its 12 companies and their subsidiaries. We did not find anything like that. The Huffington Post estimated total union spending on elections and lobbying nationwide at $1.7 billion. It cautioned that this probably included double counting. The Republic Report had a total for the top 10 unions of $153 million. To further complicate the picture, the unions also give through third-party organizations that don’t reveal their donors. However, in this arena, unions face some special reporting requirements. A Huffington Post analysis found that a pro-Democrat group, Patriot Majority USA, received about $2.26 million from unions in 2012. We would also note that when it comes to action on the ground in elections, unions can deploy hundreds of volunteers in a single city -- a way to influence the political process that the Kochs cannot match. Volunteers are not campaign spending, but they are a key tool in the political process. The lone apples-to-apples comparison We know there are holes in the data, both on the Koch and union sides. We don’t know how big those holes are, but there is one narrow part of the political world where we can find reliable data. Federal elections offer the most uniform framework for tracking campaign money. There is information on donations to candidates, parties and political action committees, and information on expenditures. Once the Center for Responsive Politics figured out the names of the many nonprofits in the Koch network, it was able to spot when those dollars showed up in the federal database or tax documents. In 2012, the center found that groups in the Koch network, so-called social welfare organizations with 501(c)(4) tax status, spent $170 million, and $86 million of that had come through the Koch network's main donor organizations. The comparable number for all the union groups, those with a 501(c)(5) tax status, was $24 million. ""We can trace $86 million back to the top of the Koch network,"" Maguire said. ""The magnitude far exceeds the total for the liberal and union groups."" Again, this is not total spending. It is just a comparison where the kind of organizations and the use of the money are matched as closely as possible. In other words, for this sort of political money tracked at the federal level, the network linked to the Koch brothers spent three and a half times more than the unions. We contacted Koch Industries for a response to Trudeau’s claim and did not hear back. Our ruling Doonesbury, aka Garry Trudeau, said the Koch brothers spent three times more than the top 10 unions combined in the 2012 elections. The information came from sources that attempted to track the political giving of the Kochs and the biggest unions. But there are some complications with the numbers. On the Koch side, the sources Trudeau cited did not say that all of the money connected to David and Charles Koch was their personal money. The Kochs have played a key role in creating a unique legal mechanism to raise and spend money that obscures the ultimate donors, and the nature of that mechanism gives them a high level of of control over how it is spent. To some extent, unions also feed into third-party money operations. And union political activity is spread much wider and among more organizations than the Kochs’ giving. In short, a true apples-to-apples comparison is quite difficult. That said, one independent analysis of trackable federal data found organizations tied to the Kochs spent three and a half times what unions did in 2012. How does all of this shake out? Trudeau goes too far in ascribing all of the money to the Kochs but the ratio he offers is in the ballpark of what we can determine at the federal level. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6A15C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/23/doonesbury/doonesbury-says-koch-brothers-outspent-unions-3-1/

Obama boasts about number of voting rights cases 'taken on' by Justice Department during his tenure
","During the week of the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, President Barack Obama gave a fiery speech to Al Sharpton’s National Action Network Convention in Manhattan in which he attacked Republicans for leading efforts to pass laws ""making it harder, not easier, for people to vote."" ""We're not going to let voter suppression go unchallenged,"" Obama said on April 11. ""So earlier this week you heard from the attorney general, and there's a reason the agency he runs is called the Department of Justice. They've taken on more than 100 voting rights cases since 2009, and they've defended the rights of everybody, from African-Americans to Spanish speakers to soldiers serving overseas."" Obama’s statement that the Justice Department had taken on more than 100 voting rights cases since 2009 was disputed by Hans von Spakovsky, a former DOJ lawyer under President George W. Bush who is now an election law expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Spakovsky wrote in a blog that the Justice Department website showed only 39 such cases under Obama. A reader contacted us about the discrepancy, so we decided to fact-check Obama’s statistic. Voting Rights Act The Voting Rights Act dates back to 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed it into law shortly after signing the Civil Rights Act. The law was intended to prevent denying the right to vote based on race. Section 5 of the law required the federal government to pre-approve some states’ changes to voting laws, affecting mostly states in the South, including parts of Florida. In June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the pre-approval provision of the Voting Rights Act in the Shelby County vs. Holder case. With states like Florida, Texas and North Carolina passing laws about voter ID or other restrictions, voting rights has emerged as a hot topic and could play a role in 2014 races, including the battle for governor in Florida. To dispute Obama’s number of more than 100 cases, the Heritage Foundation pointed to a DOJ list of voting section litigation cases that included 41 cases filed since 2009. The cases pertain to discrimination, absentee voting overseas and other matters. (We don’t find the difference between 39 and 41 significant -- von Spakovsky said that the case involving the New Black Panther Party was filed in early January, before Obama was inaugurated, so that’s one he didn’t count.) The reason why that DOJ website page shows a much smaller number than the one Obama cited is that the online list represents only cases filed by the Justice Department -- not cases in which the department was a defendant or filed an amicus. Justice spokeswoman Dena Iverson sent PolitiFact a list of voting rights cases in which the voting section of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice began its participation after January 21, 2009. That list contains 102 cases. ""The list includes all voting rights cases whether the department participated in the case as a plaintiff, a defendant, amicus or otherwise,"" Iverson said. The list includes cases that have concluded and are pending, as well as cases that are moot due to the Shelby County v. Holder ruling, she said. It does not include cases if they were strictly federal appellate cases or out-of-court settlements reached in 2010 and 2012 under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. So the ""more than 100 cases"" referenced by Obama refers to a broader list than the one on DOJ’s website cited by Heritage. The list of 102 cases includes about a half-dozen cases involving the state of Florida, including a few in which the state of Florida was the plaintiff. One of the most notable cases is the Justice Department complaint against the state or conducting a purge of its voter registration rolls within 90 days of an election. (A federal appeals court ruled April 1 that Florida violated the law, but by then Secretary of State Ken Detzner had announced he had canceled the next round of the non-citizen purge.) We sent a summary of DOJ’s explanation about the 102 cases to von Spakovsky. ""To say that it is a positive development when the department is a defendant in a lawsuit is silly – such an action is not being undertaken because the Department is being aggressive in launching lawsuits to protect voting rights. It is because a state or local jurisdiction has sued the Department claiming DOJ has done something wrong. Under that definition, if DOJ is sued 100 times because of its wrongdoing, this would be a positive development,"" he told PolitiFact in an email. ""This was deceptive claim by the president – to any layman, taking on cases means filing lawsuits to enforce the law on behalf of victims."" He also argued that it would be far-fetched to say that filing an amicus brief is ""taking on a case."" We asked a few other experts what they thought about the cases. Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law school professor, said that DOJ’s explanation was legitimate. ""Some of the more significant cases (e.g., DOJ litigating the Texas redistricting from this cycle) involve the DOJ as formal defendant in what used to be a lawsuit under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. And in other cases, having the DOJ as an amicus adds a great deal to the court's resolution of an issue."" However, Levitt said that it's difficult to come to any meaningful conclusion just by counting the number of cases. ""All cases aren't the same, either in scope or difficulty level. ... And jurisdictions don't infringe in the same ways, at the same rate, across time. Even if the cases were all of the same scope and difficulty, you'd expect the number of cases to rise or drop based on what's actually going on in the states and whether it violated the law,"" he told PolitiFact. University of California law professor Richard Hasen said that the Justice Department ""has faced an interesting and difficult environment in which to bring suits under the Voting Rights Act."" The department knew if it was too aggressive under the preclearance part of the law that there was a danger the Supreme Court could strike it down -- which ultimately happened. For other types of suits, most of the low-hanging fruit was gone by the time Obama took office. Since the Shelby decision, the Justice Department has brought two significant suits trying to get North Carolina and Texas covered again by a preclearance rule. ""These cases are quite significant, and if they are successful they likely will spur other suits in this area,"" Hasen said. ""I'd say that in evaluating significance, it is not just the number of suits but the nature of the suits which matter."" Our ruling Obama said the Justice Department has ""taken on more than 100 voting rights cases since 2009."" Obama’s statement was somewhat vague, because he didn’t explain during his speech what he meant by ""taken on"" cases. Some listeners could have interpreted that to mean all cases in which the department was the plaintiff. That's not the case though; the Justice Department has a list of 102 cases that include instances in which the department is the plaintiff, the defendant or played some other role.

Scott Walker opponent Mary Burke says working Wisconsin women earn 80% of what men earn
","Marking what President Barack Obama proclaimed as National Equal Pay Day, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke uttered a claim that many politicians have made in one form another at the state or national level. ""Women deserve equal pay for equal work. It's just that simple,"" Burke, a Madison School Board member, said in an April 8, 2014 news release. ""In Wisconsin, a woman only earns 80 cents for every dollar a man earns -- and pay discrimination doesn't just hurt our families, it hurts our economies, too."" Let's take a look. Similar claims In rating a number of pay-gap claims, we and our PolitiFact colleagues have found that wording is crucial. Two of those fact-checks help put Burke's claim into perspective. Former Dane County executive Kathleen Falk, while campaigning for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination to challenge Walker in the 2012 recall election, said Wisconsin women ""are paid 81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job."" The key phrase was ""same job."" We rated the statement False, finding that Falk misquoted the very report she relied on. The report said that -- among all men and women in Wisconsin working all sorts of jobs -- women earned 81 cents for every dollar earned by men. Burke's claim, in contrast, is more similar to one made by Obama. ""You know, today, women make up about half our workforce, but they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns,"" Obama said in his January 2014 State of the Union speech. ""That is wrong, and in 2014, it's an embarrassment. Women deserve equal pay for equal work."" PolitiFact National rated Obama's statement Mostly True. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, our colleagues found, women who worked full-time, year-round in 2012 made 77 cents for every $1 men earned across the country. The comparison includes all male and female workers regardless of occupation. Our colleagues noted, however, the existence of a pay gap doesn’t necessarily mean the gap is caused by discrimination. Work by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, for example, found that one factor is that women more often choose lower-paying jobs such as receptionists, nurses and teachers, while men more often pursue paths as truck drivers, managers and computer software engineers. Wisconsin figures  So what's the situation in Wisconsin? Three organizations -- the Institute for Women's Policy Research, the National Partnership for Women & Families and the American Association of University Women -- also cited 2012 census data as the latest available. Those figures show Wisconsin women earned 78 cents per $1 earned by men. The American Association of University Women said in a March 2014 report that the median annual earnings for Wisconsin women working full time year round was $36,535 -- 78 percent of the $46,898 earned by men. (The median is the middle number -- in other words, half of the workers earned more than that amount and half earned less.) Commenting on the pay gap at the national level, the association said career choices explain some of the pay gap. But even after accounting for college major, occupation, hours worked and other factors, the association said, 7 percent of the gap nationally between men and women college graduates remained unexplained one year after graduation. So, there is evidence that Wisconsin women earn 78 cents per $1 of what men earn, although the role discrimination might play is not clear. Our rating Burke said: ""In Wisconsin, a woman only earns 80 cents for every $1 a man earns."" Her claim is slightly conservative, in that census data put the figure at 78 cents. It's worth noting that the gap is not necessarily due to discrimination -- a conclusion some might have drawn because Burke's statement made reference to pay discrimination.

Kay Hagan says GOP rival Thom Tillis called Obamacare 'a great idea'
","In her quest to win a second term, Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., has been hit hard by attacks over her vote for Obamacare. In a recent radio ad, she fights back, charging that her potential Republican opponent, state House Speaker Thom Tillis, actually said he liked the health care law. Here’s a portion of the narration in Hagan’s ad: ""Politicians. These days, you’ve got to watch them close. Real close. Here’s Republican Senate candidate Thom Tillis describing Obamacare: (Audio clip of Tillis) ’It’s a great idea.’ That’s right. Thom Tillis called Obamacare ‘a great idea.’ That was on the Bill LuMaye Show just this February. You can look it up."" If true, that would be problematic for his chances of winning a Republican primary, since Tillis, considered the establishment conservative in the race, is facing opponents who boast of their uncompromising opposition to the law. Is the ad correct that Tillis is a closet fan of Obamacare, even though his own campaign website calls for a ""full repeal"" of the law and labels it ""a cancer on our national economy and it threatens the quality of every American's health care""? As it turns out, Hagan’s ad uses just half of the quote. Let’s go to the audiotape. Tillis made his comment on the Raleigh, N.C.-based talk show hosted by Bill LuMaye on Feb. 6, 2014. Here’s some of the conversation that preceded and followed the snippet used in Hagan’s ad. LuMaye said that Obamacare is ""devastating business, the economy, tax revenues, but more importantly lives. People who can’t see their doctors, can’t afford the insurance. I mean, I can go down the list -- I don’t need to tell you this. This is it? We have to wait until, what, 2017 in the hopes that we have a Republican in the White House? Can we survive that long?"" Tillis responded, ""I don’t think so. I think that we can make progress beginning in 2015 with a majority-Republican Senate. Maintain the majorities in the House. We can send legislation to the president that he may veto, but I think that we will make some progress. I think there may be some things that he’d rather not do, but they’ve got to understand the political consequences of continuing to fight for a failed policy."" A little later on, he added, ""A majority of the legislatures are Republican controlled -- a part of what we need to do is to mobilize the states to put on a more unified front against the federal government and get our legislatures more coordinated so that we keep the consequences of Obamacare in the minds of everyone, and build public support for pressuring members of Congress to vote with us and vote with the Republican majority."" Tillis concluded, ""I think there’s a lot of things we can do if we focus on a systematic approach to eliminating the bad -- and the majority of the stuff that is in Obamacare is bad, because it’s not fiscally sustainable. It’s a great idea that can’t be paid for -- let’s focus on the net problem versus a policy that’s creating as many problems as it fixes in terms of health care, and then it’s also creating the most devastating problem of a deficit and debt that we can’t afford."" So what Tillis actually did in the interview was to call Obamacare ""a great idea that can’t be paid for."" And most of his comments before that discussed ways to repeal the bill, not support for it. This is far from the ringing endorsement that Hagan’s ad portrays. So how does the Hagan campaign defend its editing of Tillis’ comment? It says the point of the ad is to show that Tillis is playing both sides of the street on Obamacare. ""Our ad says he’s trying to have it both ways, which he is,"" said Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Hagan campaign. ""He’s trying to take credit for supporting the popular parts of the law, but he has no plan to do that, and the only thing he does support is full repeal, which would mean insurance companies could deny care because of an existing condition and charge women more than men."" We found some justification for this argument when we checked a claim by a pro-Democratic group that Tillis would let insurance companies ""deny coverage for pre-existing conditions."" We found that claim Mostly True, because Tillis hasn’t given concrete promises to keep any Obamacare provisions, such as that one, if and when a repeal takes place. Still, the use of misleading evidence in this case weakens the Hagan campaign’s argument. Our ruling Hagan’s ad says Tillis ""called Obamacare ‘a great idea.' "" That’s a severely edited quote. What Tillis actually said was that Obamacare is ""a great idea that can’t be paid for."" Pulling out that tiny sound bite gives a highly misleading view of what Tillis said in the interview. In reality, both sides in this contest are trying to have it both ways. Tillis wants to trumpet his opposition to Obamacare for a Republican primary audience that detests the law, yet downplay the reality that the across-the-board repeal he calls for would eliminate some broadly popular provisions. Hagan, for her part, is trying to argue that Tillis privately supports the very Obamacare he fiercely opposes in public. But to make that argument, she’s relying on extraordinarily thin evidence. We rate Hagan’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCDDE80>],/factchecks/2014/apr/22/kay-hagan/kay-hagan-says-gop-rival-thom-tillis-called-obamac/

Ralph Reed says 'irrefutable' social science shows kids better off raised by straight couples
","On ABC’s Easter Sunday edition of This Week, host Martha Raddatz discussed the intersection of religion and politics with her guests. ""Just a few months after taking office, Pope Francis spoke out on the issue of homosexuality, saying, ‘If they accept the Lord and have goodwill, who am I to judge them?’ "" she said. "" ‘They shouldn't be marginalized, the tendency to homosexuality is not the problem. They're our brothers.’ "" Faith and Freedom Coalition founder Ralph Reed told Raddatz he doesn’t support gay couples raising adopted children. ""This is about what's best for children here in the United States. And the social science is irrefutable,"" Reed said. ""And it is that a child who grows up in a home without the mother and father present and they both play very unique procreative, nurturing and socializing role, they're nine times more likely to end up dropping out of high school. They're five times more likely to end up in poverty. And they're three times more likely to end up addicted to drugs and alcohol."" PunditFact wanted to know what social science has to say about the effects gay parents have on children compared to straight parents. The social science statistics Reed called ""irrefutable"" actually have nothing to do with gay couples raising kids. Instead, they’re focused on the effects of children who grow up without a father in a one-parent household. Put another way, the studies focus on the quantity of parents and not their gender. Reed’s office pointed us to his book, as well as a Brookings Institution report that says parents who graduate from high school and bear children within marriage have a 2 percent chance of living in poverty. But neither the study nor his book draws any comparison between gay and straight marriages. In fact, it makes no mention of gay marriages. Other research often cited by gay parenting critics, like Sara McLanahan’s Growing Up With a Single Parent, similarly doesn’t include any information on gay parenting, specifically. Again, the critique is focused on having one parent present versus two. We decided not to investigate further the specific stats Reed cited once we realized they weren’t measuring what he said they were. Comparisons like Reed’s are ""a complete misuse of the research,"" said Judith Stacey, a New York University sociologist. We did find one study funded by conservative organizations as showing gay parents are worse than straight ones, but it’s been denounced by the American Sociological Association, the researcher’s own university and many reputable sociologists. In conducting the study, Mark Regnerus loosely defined same-sex couples and, in doing so, only spoke with two children who were actually raised by gay parents. Research is still limited, but many reputable studies so far have concluded that children of gay parents, generally speaking, are just as well off as children of straight parents. What’s more important is the number of parents a child has, experts told us. ""Kids are better off with two parents,"" said Andrew Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University. ""But we don't have much evidence that those parents must be of the opposite gender."" Our ruling Reed said there’s ""irrefutable"" social science to show that children are better off being parented by a mother and father. That’s not right. What studies really show is that children are better off with two parents. Those studies do not focus on gender. All reputable research so far indicates that children brought up by gay parents are just well off as those brought up by straight parents. We rate Reed’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC270C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/22/ralph-reed/ralph-reed-says-irrefutable-social-science-shows-k/

Radio host: Only conservatives get banned on Facebook
","It seems like plenty of conservatives have a love-hate relationship with Facebook. They love to leverage its power and rack up big numbers when a post goes viral. But they hate it when Facebook yanks something they’ve put up. Conservative radio talk show host Todd Starnes thought he had grounds for complaint. He had quipped on his Facebook page that the owner of cattle that were grazing on federal land without a permit should have claimed they were Mexican cows seeking a better life. Facebook removed the post. On Fox News’ Hannity, Starnes blamed liberals. ""Liberals just don't have a sense of humor,"" Starnes said. ""Not the first time they have come after me for something I wrote on Facebook. And a lot of people think it's Facebook removing conservative posts, but they tell us that it’s an algorithm that the liberals have somehow figured out and coincidentally all the people getting banned from Facebook are somehow conservatives."" There are two elements here to check. Is there an algorithm that liberals, or anyone, could exploit to bring down messages they don’t agree with? And are all the people getting banned from Facebook conservatives? We reached out to Starnes for supporting details and didn’t hear back. According to the press office at Facebook, there is no algorithm. The mega-social media site has community standards (Facebook says it does not tolerate bullying, hate speech and pornography, for examples) and readers can report posts that they think violate the rules. But a statement on the site says reports alone won’t bring a post down. ""The number of times something is reported doesn't determine whether or not it's removed from Facebook,"" the statement says. A person, not an algorithm, decides the fate of a post. ""When a person reports something to Facebook, we review whether it violates our Community Standards,"" Facebook spokesman Matt Steinfeld told PunditFact. ""Abusive content directed at private individuals and attacks on people based on their race, ethnicity or national origin will be removed when reported to us."" It is the abusive content, not the politics or ideology behind it, that lead to a post coming down. We were assured that the number of reports have no effect on the likelihood that a post will be reviewed. So then there’s the question of whether only conservatives suffer at the hands of this system. Starnes isn’t the first person to make a claim like this. At least one conservative website, facebookcensorship.com, has been set up for people to report when they feel they’ve been unfairly treated. A website affiliated with the conservative Weekly Standard, Examiner.com, reported that several conservative groups and bloggers found themselves temporarily banned by Facebook. The Examiner linked this to an anti-spam feature that spotted people who posted to different pages too quickly. Accurate or not, the instances don’t prove that Facebook only targets conservatives. The issue is: Do liberals make the same complaints? They do. In 2011, a liberal blogger wrote ""liberal page administrators and bloggers in my network started spreading the word that they had been blocked from posting ANY content on ANY other wall for 15 days. No prior warning was given."" In 2012, a group called ""Being Liberal"" complained about being kicked off Facebook. ""I believe that there is right now an 'army' of paid trolls working for the conservative black PR macjine (sic) that is reporting our content,"" a poster wrote. A blog out of the Harvard Law School warned that the Facebook reviews inevitably will be subjective because they are done by human beings. One reporter who spent time at Facebook found that reviewers aim to make a decision within half a second. That wouldn’t leave much time for a careful assessment. There have been cases where Facebook has admitted that it made a mistake. Our ruling Starnes said all the people getting banned from Facebook are conservatives and that liberals had figured out a way to game the system. We could find no tally of conservative versus liberal complaints about troubles with Facebook. Starnes said all the people getting banned were conservatives and that is not the case. As for the algorithm, Facebook says there isn’t one. Users report violations and staff at Facebook review those reports. We rate this claim False. Update: We've updated this fact-check with an additional example of a liberal group complaining of being blocked on Facebook after a reader noted that one our previous examples likely came from a satirical conservative group.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB41A40>],/factchecks/2014/apr/22/todd-starnes/radio-host-only-conservatives-get-banned-facebook/

Hollywood had more homicides than any other city in Broward in 2013 -- and the chief is to blame, union says
","The police union in Hollywood has launched a high-profile battle in an effort to oust Chief Frank Fernandez, and they have literally taken their message to the sky. In March, the Police Benevolent Association floated a banner from an airplane that flew over the beach and downtown that declared, ""Hollywood a high crime area. Thanks Chief Fernandez!"" Then on April 15, the PBA posted a billboard on Pembroke Road that stated: ""Hollywood is #1 in Broward homicides in 2013. Thanks Chief Fernandez!"" We decided to investigate whether the homicide statistic is accurate and if Fernandez can be blamed for it. Hollywood police department battles To understand the backdrop of the billboard requires a bit of history about the years of feuds between city officials and police union leaders in this city of 145,000. In 2011, the city declared financial urgency and cut officers’ pay, which led to protests from the union and officer turnover. Fernandez became the city’s assistant city manager overseeing public safety in 2012 and chief in 2013, and he’s been tasked with trying to turn around the long-troubled department. Though Hollywood has a popular beach front that draws tourists and snowbirds, it’s also had some famous scandals in recent years. In 2007, a handful of officers convicted in a scheme that included selling heroin to undercover agents posing as mobsters. (The chief at the time was accused of leaking information about the probe before the arrests, forcing the FBI to bring it to a close prematurely.) A separate group of officers drew national attention in 2009 after one of them crashed into a vehicle, and video captured employees saying they would ""do a little Walt Disney"" to protect the officer and doctor a police report. News reports in the Sun-Sentinel indicate Fernandez has had some success: He has increased recruiting, made physical improvements to the police station and brought a close to contract negotiations. Fernandez also brought in outside consultants to audit the agency, and they found problems with its use-of-force policy, missing internal affairs files and forgotten rape kits, the Sun-Sentinel reported. The union disputes the audit and says it was written by a hired consultant tasked with finding fault. The billboard is the latest round in the battle between the police union and city leaders who say it’s just another ploy. Hollywood crime statistics Jeff Marano, president of the police union, sent us Hollywood crime statistics from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The data showed homicides in the city rose from five in 2012 to 16 in 2013. A spokeswoman for the city didn’t dispute the numbers but said they come with some caveats. First, the homicides were either drug- or gang-related or domestics, Raelin Storey said. ""There were not random acts of murder taking place in the city of Hollywood,"" she said. The reasons behind the homicides aren’t the point, Marano said. ""A homicide is a homicide,"" he said. ""It’s a dead person."" Assessing whether the number of homicides placed Hollywood in the No. 1 slot in Broward was more complicated because statewide data for 2013 hasn’t been published yet. (Marano said he determined Hollywood was the highest by speaking with a Hollywood homicide detective who speaks with his counterparts at other departments.) So we decided to do our own research and contact law enforcement agencies in Broward County to ask them to supply the number of homicides in their city in 2013. We mostly focused our search on the larger cities or the ones that had more than five homicides in 2012. The results: Hollywood: 16 Fort Lauderdale: 13 Pompano Beach: 8 Lauderhill: 6 Lauderdale Lakes: 5 Oakland Park: 5 Miramar: 4 Pembroke Pines: 0 We did not find any city that had a higher number of homicides than Hollywood in Broward. Not surprisingly, the city pointed to statistics that give residents a more favorable impression of safety in their city. The data from FDLE showed other serious offenses, which include sexual assaults, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and larceny and motor vehicle thefts. In total, those offenses dropped 13 percent in Hollywood in 2013. FDLE data showed that the crime rate dropped from 5,869 in 2012 to 5,050.9 in 2013. Experts pick apart union’s billboard We sent the union’s statement and the city’s recent murder statistics to a few criminologists. Several experts told us that when examining small numbers from one year to the next, a jump can appear significant even when it’s not. To draw meaningful conclusions requires looking at several years of data and examining the nature of the homicides. ""Homicides are rare events in Hollywood, and as such the rates can bounce around quite a bit,"" said James Lynch, chair of the criminology department at the University of Maryland and former director of the federal government’s Bureau of Justice Statistics. We asked Marano to explain why the union pinned the number of homicides on the chief. Marano cited the chief’s ""poor leadership"" and deployment of officers, specifically ""not enough officers assigned to street level crimes."" But the experts we interviewed rejected the idea that the chief was to blame for the number of murders in one year. ""Let’s assume the facts are correct,"" said Robert Friedmann, a professor emeritus of criminal justice at Georgia State University. ""So does that mean blame chief for it? Unless the chief is the one who shoots the people, I would say absolutely not."" While there are steps police departments can take in an effort to reduce crime, there are several factors -- including neighborhood and economic conditions and drug and gang activity -- that influence the number of murders in a city in a given year. Those conditions are entirely or largely out of the control of the police, said Ronald L. Akers, a criminology professor at the University of Florida. ""We like to attribute declines in crime rates in a community to good police work, but there is not strong evidence to support that,"" Akers said. ""Similarly, one may want to attribute increases in crime to bad police work or an ineffective police department, but again, where is the evidence to support that? What have the police done any differently in 2013? What if the number of murders come down again in 2014?"" Our ruling The police union’s billboard states, ""Hollywood is #1 in Broward homicides in 2013. Thanks Chief Fernandez!"" Hollywood had 16 homicides in 2013, and we could not find any city that had any more homicides than Hollywood. While the number is correct, the union cherry-picked crime statistics to find one that puts the city in the worst light. At this point, we have no idea if the number is part of a trend or an aberration. We also know that overall, crime decreased. The billboard places the blame on Chief Fernandez, but criminologists say the chief can’t be blamed for the number of murders, especially when it is such a small number. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDFA0C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/22/broward-county-police-benevolent-association/hollywood-had-more-homicides-any-other-city-browar/

Obama has proposed 442 tax hikes, says anti-tax group
","President Barack Obama is no stranger to the charge that he likes to raise taxes. But a new report from an anti-tax group says he’s actually proposed raising taxes more than 400 times. ""Obama has proposed 442 tax hikes since taking office,"" said Americans for Tax Reform in an April 14 press release. ""History tells us what Obama was able to do. This list reminds us of what Obama wanted to do,’"" said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, in the statement. The group released a list of 442 measures the group considered a tax increase, divided into sections for each fiscal year’s budget from 2010 to 2015. The report is based on an analysis of the budgets the Obama administration has proposed since taking the White House. Americans for Tax Reform is well known for opposing tax increases. The group promotes a famous pledge, which says politicians will oppose ""any and all efforts"" to increase income taxes and will also oppose ""any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates."" That means they don’t support any measure that brings more revenue into the government. We wondered if the group was accurate in how it was counting up Obama’s proposals. We’ve tracked Obama’s campaign promises on taxes, and while he has definitely proposed new taxes, we were suspicious that it was 442 separate tax increases. (Indeed, we track 24 campaign promises from Obama on the topic of taxes, a group that includes proposed tax hikes as well as proposed tax breaks.) So we decided to put Americans for Tax Reform’s number to our Truth-O-Meter. The list  We started out with a close examination of the long list of proposals on their 15-page press release. Each fiscal year budget has its own section, stating the year of the proposal and the total number of measures for each year. The release does not elaborate on the specifics of each measure beyond briefly stating its purpose. We found there are plenty of measures on the list that would increase taxes. One example: Obama’s pledge to impose a so-called ""Buffett Rule,"" which would set a minimum tax rate of approximately 30 percent on millionaires. Also included on the list are several tax increases on the oil and gas industry, either by eliminating existing credits for oil companies or through entirely new taxes, another pledge Obama made during his presidential campaigns. Many items on the list, though, struck us as either double-counted or not a tax at all. Here’s a summary of some of the problems we found. The list counts the same proposals multiple times. Americans for Tax Reform listed a measure each time it appeared in one of Obama’s budgets. As a result, 276 of the proposals on the list have at least one match somewhere else in the document. (We didn’t include proposals that have a similar but not identical wording to others on the list.) Obama did propose these measures multiple times, but it is misleading to count each time he included a measure in his budget as a newly proposed tax increase. For example, Obama has long proposed ending a special tax category, known as ""carried interest,"" that allows hedge fund managers and other financial investors to claim lower tax rates than ordinary workers. But Congress has never signed off on getting rid of the special category. Americans for Tax Reform counts Obama’s idea four times on its list, because it has appeared in four budget proposals. But it’s really the same proposal. Removing duplicates eliminates about 159 of the proposals, cutting the total down to 283 proposed tax hikes. Americans for Tax Reform said it didn’t see these as duplicates, since Obama specifically proposed them each year in his budgets. ""If President Obama proposes tax increases several times in several different budgets, he deserves full credit for doing so,"" said Ryan Ellis, the group’s tax policy director, via email. Some items aren’t tax increases. We noticed that the list includes several administrative changes to the tax code that aren’t tax increases.  Here are a few examples: Require greater electronic filing of returns; Index all tax penalties to inflation; Make repeated willful failure to file a tax return a felony; Require e-filing by certain large organizations. Oddly, we found that a few measures included on the list were actually tax decreases, such as the proposal  from the president’s 2015 budget to eliminate the telephone excise tax. We flagged 34 of the proposals on the list as ones that either wouldn’t raise taxes or would only do so through a penalty for failing to comply with the proposal. Americans for Tax Reform agreed that four of the items we found were not tax increases, including the repeal of the telephone excise tax. Ellis said they would adjust their total accordingly. But they did feel that 11 items, including indexing tax penalties for inflation, were tax increases because they would increase revenue to the government. The other items ""fall into an area where reasonable minds can draw different conclusions,"" he said. The Americans for Tax Reform list also failed to account for other tax cuts that are part of Obama’s record, including nearly $220 billion in tax cuts that were part of the federal stimulus. We ran our findings by Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, and an expert on federal tax policy. He said it wasn’t useful to count tax proposals without any consideration for what’s in the proposal. ""This whole matter of the number of tax hikes he proposed is silly,"" Toder said via email. ""If someone raised my taxes 442 times by 1 cent each time or one time by $100,000, I think I would prefer the former to the latter."" Our ruling  Americans for Tax Reform said that ""Obama has proposed 442 tax hikes since taking office.""  While the list accompanying the claim does contain some proposals that would have increased taxes, it overstates the total number by a significant amount. Our analysis suggests about 200 items should be knocked off this list, because it includes the same items Obama proposed in multiple budgets and some proposals that cannot be considered tax increases. We rate this Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE54E80>],/factchecks/2014/apr/22/americans-tax-reform/obama-has-proposed-442-tax-hikes-says-anti-tax-gro/

Lawmaker's pilot claim travels safe
","There are many languages spoken in Georgia, y’all, but one state lawmaker put together a bill earlier this year that would require all official state business be conducted in English. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Don Balfour, a Republican from Gwinnett County, offered an explanation for the legislation that prompted us to do some fact-checking. ""When you get a commercial pilot’s license, you learn to communicate in English no matter where you are in the world -- because it is a practical necessity for everyone in the air to be able to communicate in a common language,"" Balfour said in a glossy, four-page newsletter the lawmaker sent to his constituents. Is this true? State law already makes English the official language of Georgia, though the code permits government agencies to issue forms in other languages. Balfour’s bill, Senate Resolution 1031, did not pass this year. It was sent to the Senate’s Rules Committee, but it never got a vote by the entire Senate. Critics recoiled at some aspects of the bill, such as requiring a driver’s license exam be done in English. The test is currently available in 11 languages. In response to some fatal accidents where the lack of proficiency of English appeared to be a factor, one major international organization of air traffic controllers and pilots created guidelines for them to speak English to communicate in the sky. In 2008, the International Civil Aviation Organization determined that pilots, air traffic controllers and aeronautical station operators involved in international operations should be able to speak and understand English at a specific proficiency. The ICAO, which works with the United Nations through a special agreement, serves 191 countries. It was formed in the 1940s. The list of countries includes traditional foes of industrialized nations such as Afghanistan, Cuba, Iran and Venezuela. North Korea is not on the list, although there’s not much worldwide commerce with that nation. North Korea reportedly does most of its trade with China. A handful of newer nations are not on the list. The ICAO tests can be administered by companies or organizations within various countries that adhere to the ICAO’s regulations, and they are designed specifically for aviation. In the United States, the federal government requires commercial pilots to read, speak, write and understand English. ""You do have to know English,"" said Sarah Dunn, a senior communications and public affairs associate of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. Dunn, too, cited the ICAO’s rules. NATCA represents over 20,000 air traffic controllers, engineers and other safety-related professionals. She noted that some pilots’ English is better than others. Nonetheless, as Balfour said, commercial pilots across nearly the entire world are required to speak some English. Since there are a few countries not on the list, we believe there is a little context that needs to be understood.

Which is more unpopular: Obamacare or repealing Obamacare?
","Searching for painted eggs. Brunch with the family. Heading to church dressed in Sunday best. Debating health care. Maybe not all of those fit in your Easter morning routine, but when you're a spokesman for one of the two major parties in this election climate, even when people are celebrating a holiday, you’re talking Obamacare. As was the case April 20, 2014, on CNN’s State of the Union, where Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee and Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer jousted over the Affordable Care Act’s potential impact on the 2014 midterms. When asked about Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., running campaign ads talking about fixing Obamacare, Elleithee said there’s a difference between positive fixes and full-on repeal. ""Mary Landrieu is absolutely going to say, and I think Democrats across the country are going to say, there is a difference between our side and their side. Our side supports this law, making it work better. Their side wants to take it away. People don't want that fight anymore, right?"" Elleithee said. ""One thing that is much more unpopular than the Affordable Care Act is repealing the Affordable Care Act, and people are tired of the fight that Sean and his side keep pushing."" We’ve done plenty of poll watching on President Barack Obama’s health care law. You can find examples of fact-checks about them here, here and here. We know the law itself has divided the country with a plurality of people generally holding an unfavorable view. But what about comparing the law’s popularity against the number of people who want it repealed? That’s a new one to us, and we decided it deserved a second look. Polls, polls and more polls Elleithee linked us to a couple of polls conducted in the last few months. We found a handful on our own as well. The crux of the question is this: Which is more unpopular: the law itself, or the idea of repealing the law? The Kaiser Family Foundation has released a health care poll almost monthly since early 2012, the most prolific and persistent public tracking of the bill’s popularity. According to the nonpartisan organization’s latest Health Tracking Poll conducted between March 11-17, 46 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of the law against 38 percent with a favorable opinion. How does that compare to people looking to repeal? While only 10 percent want to keep it as is it is, a plurality, or 49 percent, want to keep it in place but work to improve it. Just 29 percent said it should be repealed and replaced with a GOP alternative or nothing at all. So that’s one poll showing 46 percent expressing an unfavorable view of the law against 59 percent who would elect an option other than repealing it. That seems to back up Elleithee’s claim. Other polls were more nuanced. National Public Radio partnered with two firms, one Democrat, one Republican, for a survey between March 19-23. It measured support for the law at 47 percent with 51 percent opposing. But 44 percent said it should be repealed and replaced and 53 percent said implement and fix it. So, in this poll, those with an unpopular opinion of the law (51 percent) was pretty darn close to the people who didn’t want to repeal (53 percent). The difference in outcomes could be attributed to how varying pollsters asked the question. In the Kaiser poll, respondents had five options (keep it as is, tweak it to improve it, repeal it and replace it, just repeal or other). In the NPR poll, there were just three choices: ""Implement and fix,"" ""Repeal and replace,"" or ""Unsure/Refused."" Bloomberg News went a step further and asked about individual components of the law in a March 7-10 survey. At the macro level, the poll showed 34 percent of people calling for repeal, with 51 percent saying, ""It may need modifications but we should see how it works"" and 13 percent calling for no change. But the majority of people said one of the central pillars of the law, the individual mandate requiring almost everyone to buy health insurance, should be repealed. Other provisions, like eliminating lifetime caps on insurance and allowing children to stay on their parents’ insurance until age 26, remained quite popular. This poll didn’t ask individuals if they had a favorable or unfavorable view of the law. A poll from NBC News/Wall Street Journal conducted March 5-9 found an entirely new way to pose the question. It asked half the respondents if they would be more likely to vote for someone who supported repealing the health care law — 47 percent said yes and just 32 percent said they would be less likely. The other half of the respondents were asked if they would support a candidate who wanted to fix the law but keep it in place. While 45 percent said they would be more likely to vote for them, 42 percent would be less likely. Still, when asked if they would rather support a Democrat who would fix and keep the law, or a Republican who wanted to repeal, 48 percent said they would support the Dem and 47 percent said the GOP. So what do we make of all of this? ""I think the two items show that while the law remains more opposed than supported, the idea of repealing (or repeal and replace) also lacks majority support,"" said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll. ""In part this may reflect a lack of appetite for going through the entire process of legislating again, or perhaps concern that a replacement would be no better. It may also reflect the lack of specific proposals that would be part of a replacement."" ""Without strongly formed opinions about alternatives, surveys are likely to be especially sensitive to question wording and the particular focus of a question."" We’ll throw one more poll in there, just for fun. According to the Pew Center for People and the Press, of the 53 percent of people who disapprove of the law, a majority — 56 percent — said lawmakers should still try to make it work, while just 36 percent said they should do what they can to ensure it fails. Our ruling Elleithee says, ""One thing that is much more unpopular than the Affordable Care Act is repealing the Affordable Care Act."" Polls support that idea: Generally speaking, more people are against the idea of repeal than the Affordable Care Act. But how much of a difference varies. Elleithee said repeal is ""much more unpopular"" than Obamacare. While one respectable poll (Kaiser Family Foundation) could make that case, others were less definitive. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA31080>],/factchecks/2014/apr/21/democratic-national-committee/which-more-unpopular-obamacare-or-repealing-obamac/

Trump: Putting a plan in 'online shopping cart' is all it takes to be treated as enrolled in ACA
","News from President Barack Obama that 8 million people have signed up for health insurance plans through state and federal marketplaces has drawn plenty of skepticism from the program’s critics. On Friday, billionaire and occasional presidential contender Donald Trump tweeted that the president’s claim is based on a fundamental deception. ""ObamaCare enrollment lie: Obama counts an enrollee as a web user putting a plan in ‘their online shopping carts’,"" read Trump’s tweet. Anyone curious about the first real test of the health care law is waiting to see how many people actually pay their first premium, so we thought it would be helpful to check the accuracy of Trump’s statement. There is a measure of truth to it, but it glides over many steps in the enrollment process. Applying for coverage We buy so many things online, it’s easy to think that buying health insurance through the government marketplaces follows a familiar pattern. You decide what you want to buy and then you pay for it. But getting health insurance coverage through an Obamacare marketplace is more complicated. Here’s a summary of the steps involved: Create an account Give the names and personal details for the people to be covered Provide Social Security numbers Report your household income List other insurance carried Option to explore Medicaid eligibility Report incarceration, recently gained immigration status, etc. Review and confirm accuracy of submitted information under penalty of perjury Select tax credit (if eligible) and report tobacco use Compare and select a plan -- plan details and monthly premiums displayed Confirm plan selection, access to your tax returns (if using tax credits) Submit application -- payment instructions The final screen on the federal site looks like this:  Staff at the press office for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that handles Obamacare, told us that two things happen when this screen appears -- the government counts the person as enrolled and a data record called an 834 goes to the insurance company to start the billing process. If the person clicks the green button at the bottom to pay, what they will see depends on the insurance company. If the company accepts online payment, in theory, they will end up on the company’s payment page. Otherwise, they will get more details on the company’s billing process. The government doesn’t itself accept payments. The mechanics of paying take place between the buyer and the insurance company. At a couple of points in this process, the buyer clicks buttons that say ""Enroll,"" however, at the very end, they learn, ""Your payment must be received and processed by the effective date to be fully enrolled."" Trump’s tweet included a link to an article on the conservative news website, Townhall.com. The article said ""The federal government counts people putting Obamacare plans in their online shopping carts as 'enrolled' before they pay for the plan or check out."" A gradual path to full enrollment While it’s accurate that the government will count someone as enrolled before they have paid their bill, in a limited fashion, the insurance companies will also treat them as if they were. America’s Health Insurance Plans is a leading trade association for insurers. According to the AHIP press office, most states require a grace period of 30 or 31 days to give the company time to bill and the buyer time to pay. During that time, the health plan is required to pay claims, so long as the person ultimately pays the premium.   Anyone who fails to pay after that first month has troubles. Jonathan Katz is an independent insurance broker in Northern Virginia. Katz told PunditFact that in his area, very few carriers accept online payments and typically, billing takes place through the mail. So far, Katz said the process has worked. ""The vast majority pay,"" Katz said. ""Why would you go through that long process and not pay?"" The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, said that figures from early February show that 80 to 85 percent of new customers have paid their first premium. Other insurance companies have reported similar numbers. Our ruling Trump said that the administration lies about enrollment figures because it counts people when all they have done is put a plan ""in their online shopping carts."" We've probably all put something in an online shopping cart, thought about it for a couple minutes, decided not to buy it and left it sitting there. If that same scenario occurs on healthcare.gov, does the White House consider a person enrolled? No. For a person to be considered enrolled, they must have submitted their application for health insurance. That information is transmitted to the federal government and the private insurance company. In a literal sense, that’s more than just popping something into an online shopping cart a la Amazon.  Trump also is guilty of oversimplifying a highly regulated private industry. While some insurance companies accept online payments and give Obamacare enrollees the option to pay immediately, many do not. In the Virginia-Maryland market for example, most companies mail bills to the new customers who come through the government marketplaces. That means customers don’t even have the option of paying straight away. Also, while customers may not have paid, most states require a grace period of 30 or 31 days where insurers are required to pay claims.  So maybe they don’t intend to pay and will eventually lose their coverage. But for now, they are treated as if they were enrolled. And they did a lot more than just load up an online shopping cart. We rate Trump’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE5FEC0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/21/donald-trump/trump-putting-plan-online-shopping-cart-all-it-tak/
