A pro-Marco Rubio PAC says Donald Trump bans disabled veterans from Trump Tower
","A PAC supporting Marco Rubio says Donald Trump mistreats those less fortunate than him -- including disabled veterans. Trump ""bans disabled veterans from his high rise,"" states the ad by the Conservative Solutions PAC. The ad has aired in San Francisco and multiple markets in Florida, including Miami and Tampa. Did the New York billionaire give the boot to disabled veterans from his high rise? No, he didn’t do that. Instead, he wanted to ban disabled veterans who were given special licenses to peddle from selling their wares in front of his high rise. ""It is simply not true and a misrepresentation of the facts in every way,"" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told PolitiFact Florida. A few days after the ad started running on TV, the PAC changed the wording of the line about veterans. We are putting the ad’s original claim on the Truth-O-Meter, but we will explain how and why the PAC tweaked the wording. Trump’s Fifth Avenue high rise Trump wanted to get rid of street vendors around the Trump Tower, a 68-story condo and retail building on Fifth Avenue. The ad shows a Jan. 28, 2016, headline from the Daily Beast: ""Donald Trump wanted vets kicked off Fifth Avenue."" (A spokesman for the PAC referred PolitiFact to the Daily Beast article and the New York Daily News article cited within it.) Peddling exemptions for disabled veterans have a long history in New York. First approved by the state in 1894, the exemption allowed disabled veterans to peddle on any commercial street or park throughout the state. In 1991, the state Legislature took up a bill to amend the law. Most peddling was prohibited on Fifth Avenue -- but 176 disabled veterans still had permission to peddle there. Trump wrote a letter to John Dearie, then-chairman of the state Assembly’s Committee on Cities, according to the New York Daily News: ""While disabled veterans should be given every opportunity to earn a living, is it fair to do so to the detriment of the city as a whole or its tax-paying citizens and businesses?"" Trump wrote. ""Do we allow Fifth Avenue, one of the world’s finest and most luxurious shopping districts, to be turned into an outdoor flea market, clogging and seriously downgrading the area?"" In July 1991, New York City Mayor David Dinkins announced that an agreement had been reached with the Fifth Avenue Association, which represented hundreds of businesses. The businesses would offer disabled veterans jobs at twice the minimum wage, and the association would set up a fund to pay for job training, education or to move vendors to other parts of the city. The next month, then-Gov. Mario Cuomo signed a bill to repeal the peddling, but only for four years. In 1995, when the bill was up for renewal, the Legislature struck a compromise that banned peddling from Midtown Manhattan but included a plan to allow it in other zones to be defined later. Months later, some veterans continued to peddle in the banned area. In 2004, Trump complained about the vendors in a letter to then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg. ""Whether they are veterans or not, they (the vendors) should not be allowed to sell on this most important and prestigious shopping street,"" Trump wrote, according to the New York Post. Trump wrote that business owners had to repeatedly clean up debris left as a result of the vendors. ""Frankly, I have no idea how they can be doing business with the mess they have outside their front door,"" he wrote. ""Fifth Avenue’s comeback is going to be a short one if this situation is not corrected immediately."" In response to his letter, a small group of protesters waved signs in front of Trump Tower that read, ""Vendors to Trump: You're Fired!"" and ""Why can't vets vend on streets we die to protect?"" We told the PAC’s spokesman that the ad could cause viewers to wrongly assume that Trump wanted to ban disabled veterans from living in his high rise. ""Ad didn’t mention living,"" Jeff Sadosky replied. PAC changes ad After we started our fact-check, the PAC changed the wording of the ad. The original ad started Feb. 26, according to the Political TV Ad Archive, a website that tracks campaign ads and partnered with PolitiFact and other fact-checkers. On Feb. 29, Factcheck.org wrote that the ad was ""miseading"" and left out crucial details. By that date, the ad had aired at least 135 times in the Miami, Tampa and Orlando markets. PolitiFact first contacted the PAC about the ad on Feb. 29 and then later noticed on TV that the script had changed. The original ad said that Trump ""bans disabled veterans from his high rise."" But the new version said that Trump ""bans veterans from in front of his high rise."" Sadosky said the PAC changed the ad on March 1 ""to be more specific."" Our ruling A pro-Rubio Super PAC said Trump ""bans disabled veterans from his high rise."" The TV ad is misleading because viewers could assume that Trump tried to ban disabled veterans from living in his high rise. His beef was with street vendors including disabled veterans who were given special vendor licenses selling wares around his Trump Tower. Nothing in the ad makes it clear that this related to vendors selling on the street. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809727E1C0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/08/conservative-solutions-pac/pro-marco-rubio-pac-says-donald-trump-bans-disable/

Right to Rise correct on comparison between 'worst attendance records' of Marco Rubio, Barack Obama
","A commercial by the super PAC Right to Rise USA shows a silhouette of Sen. Marco Rubio and criticizes him for his lack of foreign policy experience. ""Way too often, Rubio didn't even show up,"" the announcer says as a box on the screen tags Rubio as having ""one of the worst attendance records in the Senate."" Almost imperceptibly, the silhouette morphs into President Barack Obama as the announcer asks, ""What other junior senator had the same resume?"" Right to Rise USA is the super PAC that supported Jeb Bush, who has given up on his quest for the White House this year. According to the TV Political Ad Archive, it ran at least 400 times, mostly in South Carolina before Bush dropped out. We decided to see if both Rubio and Obama have had similar attendance records in the Senate. First, a word about terminology. In political circles, attendance is usually determined not by the number of days you show up for work in the Senate, but by the number of votes you miss. We'll use that standard. Rubio has been dealing with the attendance issue since the summer, when he had been missing more than half of all Senate roll call votes. Here's the rundown as of March 4, according to GovTrack.us, which has a running tally of voting records for members of Congress. Rubio has missed 14.9 percent of the votes since taking office in January 2011. The typical senator currently serving has missed just 1.7 percent. His record has never been exemplary, but it really deteriorated starting in the first quarter of 2015, when he missed 18.5 percent, then 32.9 percent in the second quarter, 53.8 percent in the third and 58.2 percent in the fourth. Since January he has missed more than nine in 10 votes. Obama, during his four years as a senator, missed 24.2 percent of his votes. During his time in the Senate, the median for missed votes was 2.2 percent. Sen. Obama had a great voting record until the second quarter of 2007, when he missed 17.9 percent of the votes, followed by 56.3 percent in the third quarter. By the end of the fourth quarter, with the election a year away, he was missing 89.4 percent. This chart shows the percent of missed votes for comparable quarters during the campaign season for both senators as the clock ticked down to election day. We've highlighted who missed more votes in each quarter. Quarters before election Obama in 2005-08 Rubio in 2013-16 15 0.0% of 81 votes 0.0% of 92 votes 14 6.7% of 89 votes 1.3% of 76 votes 13 1.3% of 76 votes 9.3% of 43 votes 12 0.8% of 120 votes 5.0% of 80 votes 11 0.0% of 83 votes 12.9% of 93 votes 10 1.9% of 107 votes 13.0% of 123 votes 9 1.4% of 73 votes 3.7% of 54 votes 8 0.0% of 16 votes 6.3% of 96 votes 7 2.4% of 126 votes 18.5% of 135 votes 6 17.9% of 112 votes 32.9% of 85 votes 5 56.3% of 119 votes 53.8% of 52 votes 4 89.4% of 85 votes 58.2% of 67 votes 3 36.5% of 85 votes 90.3% of 31 votes 2 84.4% of 77 votes -- 1 87.2% of 47 votes -- Election quarter 0.0% of 4 votes -- More to the point for this fact check, GovTrack has ranked Rubio compared to his colleagues based on the number of votes he's missed in the past year and the year before that. The Florida senator is in the 100th percentile — the worst — for the 12-month period and in the 95th percentile — almost as bad — for the previous 12 months. At this stage of Obama's campaign, the Illinois senator's record for missed votes in the previous 12 months put him in the 98th percentile. He was in the 32nd percentile the year before that. Our ruling Right to Rise USA said that both Rubio and Obama had ""one of the worst attendance records in the Senate."" The data show that both missed a lot of votes while running for president. Rubio started skipping votes a lot earlier than Obama did, but at this stage of the campaign, Rubio has missed more votes than any other senator in the past year, and Obama was missing more votes than 98 percent of his colleagues. Their attendance records certainly qualify as ""one of the worst."" We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3C7E00>],/factchecks/2016/mar/08/right-rise/right-rise-right-raise-criticism-candidates-rubio-/

Jon Keyser wrongly says Michael Bennet wants to bring Gitmo terrorists to Colorado
","Even before President Barack Obama sent a plan to Congress to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Republican opponents were accusing Colorado's incumbent Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of pushing to ""bring terrorists"" to a Colorado prison. No one's banged the drum louder against Bennet than Jon Keyser, who's among more than a dozen GOP candidates vying to claim Bennet's Senate seat in the November general election. ""We have about 90 terrorists that are left at Guantanamo Bay. Michael Bennet wants to close Guantanamo Bay with the president, and bring them right here to Colorado,"" Keyser said at a Feb. 11 GOP Senate candidates' forum at the University of Denver. Keyser and his campaign have made similar statements at other campaign stops, in news releases and on social media. We looked at Bennet’s record over the years on the Guantanamo Bay prison -- informally called ""Gitmo"" -- for evidence that he advocated bringing suspected terrorists to Colorado. Bennet's closing conditions Since 2009, Bennet has backed Obama's plan to close the Guantanamo Bay prison, saying: ""I do support the closure because I think it is an important signal to the rest of the world about our devotion to the rule of law."" The United States has faced international criticism about the treatment of prisoners at Gitmo, and some Western countries have said the accused terrorists should be granted prisoner of war protections under the Geneva Conventions.   However, Bennet has placed conditions on his support for relocating Gitmo detainees from the start. He said they are being tried in military tribunals, so if they are moved to the United States, they should be held in a military prison. He also has pressed the administration to provide a plan on relocating detainees and consult with local and state officials before prisoners are moved.  ""President Obama and his administration owe the American people a much more detailed plan of what they are going to do with the detainees,"" Bennet said in 2009. Colorado doesn't have a military prison, and Bennet opposes housing detainees in the state’s civilian prisons, including the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence -- known as ADX or ""supermax"" -- the highest-security federal prison in the country. In May 2009, Obama pledged to close the Guantanamo prison by January 2010. The move, without a plan of where the prisoners would be relocated, irked congressional lawmakers. On May 20, 2009, Bennet voted with fellow senators to reject an effort to spend $80 million to close the Guantanamo Bay prison and to relocate the terrorism suspects, possibly to U.S. prisons. But an amendment Bennet backed to prohibit funding to transfer Gitmo detainees to the United States was stripped out of the bill by a conference committee that irons out legislative language differences between Senate and House bills. Bennet did not serve on that committee.   A freshman senator, Bennet got into a dust-up during the 2009 debate with senior California Sen. Dianne Feinstein -- a fellow Democrat -- who said in a floor speech that Colorado’s supermax prison would be a perfect home for Gitmo detainees. ""This facility houses not only drug kingpins, serial murderers and gang leaders, but also terrorists who have already been convicted of crimes in this country,"" she said. Bennet disagreed in a statement, saying, ""I strongly support the Senate's decision to withhold funding for the transfer of the detainees until the Administration comes up with a plan for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. Because the detainees are being tried by military tribunals, they should be held in military facilities. Military detainees should not be transported to and held at Supermax because it is not a military facility."" In the same 2009 bill, Bennet voted for a Republican senator's nonbinding resolution calling on the defense secretary to consult with state and local government officials before making any decision about where Guantanamo detainees may be transferred if Gitmo was closed by a presidential executive order. We asked the Keyser campaign for evidence supporting the candidate’s claim that Bennet wants to ""bring [terrorists] right here to Colorado."" Keyser campaign spokesman Matt Connelly replied that ""Bennet knew that Colorado was at the top of the list"" of U.S. prisons where the Obama administration has considered transferring Gitmo detainees. He cited a 2009 address in which Obama suggested that Supermax could be a potential home for detainees. ""As we make these decisions, bear in mind the following fact: Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal supermax prisons, which hold hundreds of convicted terrorists,"" Obama said. Yet, other prisons have also been reported as possible replacements for Gitmo, including military facilities like Fort Leavenworth, Kan., or the U.S. Navy brig in Charleston, S.C. Connelly said that Bennet has voted against two Republican amendments to ban the transfer of Gitmo detainees to the United States. He also voted against an amendment to block funds to prepare U.S. facilities to house detainees. Connelly said such votes effectively laid the groundwork for Gitmo detainees to be transferred to the United States, including Colorado. ""It’s laughable that after years of silence, Sen. Bennet is now arguing that he didn’t want to send Gitmo terrorists to Colorado, even though he voted three times to make it happen,"" he said. Keyser's case Let’s examine the Keyser campaign’s defense of its candidate’s claims. They point to Bennet’s 2013 vote against an amendment by Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire that would have prohibited the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo bay to facilities in the United States. Congressional records confirm Bennet’s vote that helped kill the amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2014 fiscal year. Bennet spokesman Adam Bozzi said Bennet disagreed with the Ayotte amendment’s requirements about how the Defense Department certifies the security of a foreign government before a Guantanamo detainee could be transferred to that country. Bennet supported another proposal for safeguards on transferring detainees to foreign countries, Bozzi said. Ultimately, Bennet voted with an 84-to-15 Senate majority for a compromise on Guantanamo, which retained a one-year ban on transferring detainees to the United States while easing the transfer of detainees to foreign countries. It was part of the defense-funding bill that was signed into law. Keyser’s spokesman added that Bennet also voted against a 2012 amendment by Ayotte to block funding for transferring Guantanamo detainees to the United States. But Bennet’s spokesman counters that the senator voted against the amendment because it would have imposed a permanent ban on funding the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States, which a legislative report confirmed. The amendment would have also blocked other Obama administration options, including prosecuting detainees in a federal court in the United States. Given that Bennet supports closing Gitmo and potentially moving some detainees to a U.S. military prison, the senator opposed the permanent ban, his spokesman said. The permanent domestic-transfer ban amendment and a similar House amendment were left out of the final version of the 2013 defense appropriations bill to avoid a threatened White House veto. Records show Bennet instead voted for a one-year ban on transferring detainees to the United States that was included in the 2013 defense-funding bill. Lastly, the Keyser campaign points to Bennet’s 2009 vote to kill a Republican amendment that would have barred the use of funds to construct or modify prisons in the United States or its territories to hold Guantanamo Bay detainees. Bozzi, Bennet’s spokesman, again noted that Bennet, who supports closing Gitmo and moving at least some detainees to a U.S. military prison, of course opposed the amendment that would have blocked construction funding that could be used to prepare a military prison to securely hold the prisoners. ""I’ve repeatedly said I do not support the transfer of prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay military facility to Colorado,"" Bennet said recently in response to President Obama sending his Guantanamo-closure plan to Congress. ""I’ve voted to close the prison, but I believe military detainees should be held in military prisons. Colorado does not have that type of facility. This plan has done nothing to change my mind. These detainees should not be transferred to Colorado."" Our ruling Keyser said, ""We have about 90 terrorists that are left at Guantanamo Bay. Michael Bennet wants to close Guantanamo Bay with the president, and bring them right here to Colorado."" Keyser’s campaign pointed to Bennet’s votes against a permanent ban on transferring detainees to a U.S. military prison and his opposition to blocking construction funding for a prison to hold Gitmo prisoners in the United States. While Bennet has long supported closing the Guantanamo Bay prison, his statements and legislative record show that, since 2009, Bennet has opposed attempts to relocate detainees from Guantanamo to a Colorado prison, including Colorado’s federal supermax prison. Bennet has said repeatedly he thinks detainees should be held in military prisons, and there is no military prison in Colorado.

Jim Kenney and stop and frisk: Did the rookie Philly mayor change his position?
","Did Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney really promise to bring an end to stop-and-frisk? Based on a recent interview with Al Dia’s editorial board, not totally. ""I never said stop-and-frisk was going to end entirely,"" Kenney told Al Dia staffers last week. ""What we are going to stop is the random stopping of people, Latinos and African Americans, on the street and the cop asking, 'What are you doing here?' "" Kenney provided them with the following explanation: ""If you get held up on the street by a guy with a Flyers hat, and you call in 911 and you say, 'A guy with a Flyers hat just held me up at gun point.' And three minutes later the police see a guy in the neighborhood with a Flyers hat, he is going to get stopped,"" he said, ""And since you told them he has a gun, they are going to frisk him. So the issue for us is those frisks are ... constitutional and legitimate based on a call on 911 from a citizen."" It’s worth noting that Kenney is making a legal distinction here. If we’re talking about stop-and-frisk as a policy that disproportionately targets black and Hispanic men with little basis for the stops, then that’s one thing. But, ""a frisk that is based on reasonable suspicion that the person has a weapon is constitutional,"" Mary Catherine Roper, deputy legal director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania, wrote in an email. She cautioned that a reasonable search ""might a (call for) more than a Flyers hat on game day,"" but added, ""Mayor Kenney is certainly describing a process that is permitted under the law."" Police Commissioner Richard Ross told the Philadelphia Inquirer in February that eliminating stop-and-frisk isn’t altogether possible. ""At the risk of sounding flip, there's no city that has the authority to end stop-and-frisk,"" said Ross. ""The best you could do as a city is decide you want to have a precipitous drop - the only danger in that is, it's kind of a reverse quota, it suggests you had to have (a quota) in the first place."" In his campaign materials, Team Kenney did note that he would ""not permit the continued prevalence of impermissible stops-and-frisks,"" and that he would create a new reasonable suspicion training program so that police would better grasp the difference. Kenney didn’t always delineate these practices with care on the campaign trail, however. Kenney stated he would straight-up end stop-and-frisk, no ifs, no caveats, and he did so repeatedly. """"If (I'm) mayor, stop-and-frisk will end in Philadelphia, no question,"" Kenney told Newsworks last April. ""(I) would like to work with Commissioner Ramsey as well as the FOP to find a responsible way to bring that practice to an end."" After his primary win, he doubled down, ""If you have a program that divides the community from the police and it doesn’t result in anything positive going forward,"" Kenney told press, as reported by CBS Local. ""It should be stopped … I’m going to tell (then-Commissioner Ramsey) that in the end, it doesn’t make police officers safer, it doesn’t make citizens safer."" Several outlets, including Billy Penn, have noted the discrepancy between popular campaign statements and his actual goals as mayor. At Ross’ January swearing-in, Kenney summed up the knottiness of the stop-and-frisk himself, describing it as ""unfortunate terminology used as a crime fighting tool."" Our ruling The legal considerations for quelling a policy like stop-and-frisk weren’t lost on Kenney during the campaign. His written campaign materials appear consistent with his stance now. Multiple statements given to reporters along the trail, though, spoke to ceasing the practice absolutely, without the stipulations that Kenney had clarified elsewhere. We rule this claim a Half Flip.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972FB840>],/factchecks/2016/mar/08/jim-kenney/jim-kenney-and-stop-and-frisk-did-rookie-philly-ma/

Bernie Sanders has a point: Water in Flint much more expensive than in Burlington
","Sen. Bernie Sanders said during a Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., that government officials have added insult to injury by charging citizens astronomical utility rates for lead-tainted water. An audience member who lives in Flint asked both Sanders and Democratic primary opponent Hillary Clinton what they would do to help Flint’s residents regain their trust in government. Sanders called the state response ""a disgrace beyond belief"" and said that if he were president, the federal government would take over when a state is incapable of resolving such a crisis. The first place he would start is with dealing with the high price of water. ""What is absolutely incredible to me is that water rates have soared in Flint,"" Sanders said on March 6, 2016. ""You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vt., for clean water."" HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER With all the problems with Flint’s water supply, we wondered if it was accurate that Burlington pays one-third the price for service. We learned Flint did indeed have exorbitantly high rates for water that was poisoned with lead, but the numbers have recently dropped from the level Sanders is citing.   Rate debate The water crisis emerged after Gov. Rick Snyder appointed an emergency manager to oversee policy decisions in Flint, a majority African-American city ravaged by poverty following a drastic decline in the manufacturing industry. With the power to overrule local officials, then-emergency manager Michael Brown enacted a 35 percent water rate increase to shore up utilities in 2012 (remember this, because we’re coming back to it). Officials opted in April 2013 to stop getting water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and join a new pipeline project called the Karegnondi Water Authority. But the pipeline to bring water from Lake Huron wasn’t finished. While the infrastructure was being built, the city began drawing water from the Flint River in April 2014. At this point, it was already apparent water was exceptionally expensive in Flint. In June 2014, the Flint Journal reported that the city charged $35 more per month for water and sewer service than the next-highest rates in Genesee County. The Flint River’s corrosive water leached lead from pipes into the city’s supply. After months of complaints from residents, the national media started exposing the issue in the second half of 2015. (You can read a detailed review in our story here.) We didn’t hear back from the Sanders campaign about his statement. But at least one source has said Flint had the highest residential water rates in the country. Food & Water Watch, an environmental nonprofit that advocates for public utility ownership, surveyed average annual water rates for the 500 largest systems in the United States. They found that in January 2015, Flint’s average water bill was $910 per year. Unfortunately, that doesn’t include Burlington (population 42,000), but we can still compare it to Flint’s 100,000 or so residents by looking at the two city’s water rates. If you’ve ever read your own water bill, you know sussing out how you get charged is a little perplexing. But all you really need to know is that Food & Water Watch came up with their total by measuring the cost of the average household’s annual drinking water use, which is about 60,000 gallons per year. That translates to about 8,021 cubic feet, and utilities often use cubic feet to set their rates. Food & Water Watch also included meter charges that utilities may bill their customers. Flint customers were charged at least $22.90 for a typical home meter, but Burlington Public Works doesn’t charge a meter fee. Both cities’ water departments confirmed the rates we’re using. Just to further complicate things: Do you remember that 35 percent emergency rate increase from 2012? A judge ruled in August 2015 that the increase had to be rolled back because the city misused $15.7 million in water funds to settle a lawsuit. The city also must repay those millions. Because of the relatively recent change, we decided to compare Burlington and Flint both before the judge’s ruling and after: City Residential rate per 100 cubic feet Water meter charge Average annual bill for 8,021 cubic feet Flint, January 2015 $7.92 $22.90 $910 Flint, after August 2015 ruling $6.19 $17.88 $770 Burlington $4.00 $0 $321 Flint’s residential water rates used to essentially be twice Burlington’s at the start of 2015, but were about 55 percent higher after the judge ruled the rates rolled back. Neither one of those figures is three times as much as Burlington, like Sanders said. But that hefty meter fee makes a big difference. We’re including it because you had to pay it if your house in Flint had water service, raising your bill significantly. When we look at average annual bills from January 2015, Sanders’ 3-to-1 comparison is pretty close. But after August, Flint customers were paying a little more than twice as much as Burlington residents. Our ruling Sanders said, ""You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vt., for clean water."" Going back to January 2015, we find that’s the case, as long as we include both water rates and water meter charges in Flint. But after a judge rolled Flint’s rates back in August 2015, people there are paying a little more than twice as much as people in Burlington. His numbers are no longer entirely accurate, but Sanders has a point that Flint’s water bills are gallingly expensive. We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976B9BC0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/07/bernie-sanders/flint-residents-dont-pay-3-times-much-burlington-r/

Bernie Sanders wrong to say, 'When you're white ... you don't know what it's like to be poor'
","During the Democratic debate in economically distressed and racially diverse Flint, Mich., CNN’s Don Lemon asked both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders the same question: ""In a speech about policing,"" Lemon said, ""the FBI director, James Comey, borrowed a phrase saying, ‘Everyone is a little bit racist.’ What racial blind spot do you have?"" When it was Sanders’ turn to answer, he began by talking about several specific examples of racial discrimination. He then drew a contrast with what whites experience.   ""When you’re white, you don’t know what it’s like to be living in a ghetto. You don’t know what it’s like to be poor. You don’t know what it’s like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car,"" Sanders said. Several readers asked us to take a closer look at Sanders’ comment that ""when you're white ... you don't know what it's like to be poor."" Sanders' point was that white people haven’t had to contend with racism based on skin color. But when he moves into the subject of whites’ experience with poverty, he’s on weak ground. Sanders’ suggestion that white Americans haven’t experienced poverty is undercut by statistics calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Since the 1960s, the Census Bureau has tracked the numbers and percentages of Americans by race who have an income level that puts them at the poverty line. Here’s the most recent data, for 2014:   Category Number in poverty Poverty rate Americans of all races 46.7 million 14.8 percent White 19.7 million 10.1 percent African-American 10.8 million 26.2 percent Hispanic 13.1 million 23.6 percent Asian-American 2.1 million 12.0 percent By this measure, Sanders was certainly wrong to suggest that whites haven’t experienced poverty. In 2014, there were actually more white Americans in poverty -- 19.7 million -- than members of any other group. Part of the reason, of course, is that there are more white Americans than there are members of minority groups overall. (Whites account for 62 percent of the population.) Still, even though whites have a lower poverty rate than other groups -- roughly 10 percent -- even that percentage is hardly trivial. The numbers are similar if you raise the income level slightly. At 125 percent of the poverty level, the number of white Americans rises to about 26.5 million. That’s a lot of white people who are in or near poverty. ""This was a misstatement. A lot of white people know what it’s like to be poor,"" said Julia Isaacs, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. If you look at the poor as a group, minorities are disproportionately represented. Still, the white population is large enough that the majority of the people in poverty are white. That’s been the case since at least 1970. We calculated the racial and ethnic makeup of the population at the poverty line in roughly 10-year intervals, using data for the four categories above. Census data is available back to 1990 for all four groups, and they exist for all but Asians back to about 1970.   Year Percentage of people in poverty who were white Percentage of people in poverty who were black Percentage of people in poverty who were Hispanic Percentage of people in poverty who were Asian 2014 54 19 23 4 2010 54 19 24 3 2000 56 21 20 3 1990 57 25 15 2 1980 62 27 11 NA 1970 64 28 9* NA * Data is for 1972 It’s easiest to grasp the scope of white poverty when using the following graphic, which was provided to us by Christopher Wimer, a research scientist at the Columbia University Population Research Center. It’s similar to the chart above, except that it uses a more precise, though still experimental, measurement of poverty that is adjusted for geography, government benefits and other factors not captured in the traditional poverty measurement. The share of whites in the population of Americans in poverty is shown in purple. As the chart indicates, the white share has fallen, but it’s still the largest of any of the four groups studied.  Sanders said the day after the debate that he misspoke, telling reporters, ""What I meant to say is when you talk about ghettos traditionally, what you talk about is African-American communities. There is nobody on this campaign … who's talked about poverty, whether it's in the white community, the black community, the Latino community, more than I have."" Our ruling Sanders says that ""when you're white ... you don't know what it's like to be poor."" On the contrary -- the most recent figures show that nearly 20 million white Americans are experiencing poverty. While that’s smaller as a percentage than it is for other racial and ethnic groups, that’s still a lot of people. In raw numbers, it’s actually more than any other group.

Donald Trump claims NASCAR's endorsement, and he's not totally wrong
","Donald Trump has lapped the field in some recent state primaries, but he caused a caution flag Monday when he claimed that he had NASCAR’s endorsement in a speech in Concord, N.C., just miles from the NASCAR Hall of Fame and the Charlotte Motor Speedway. ""NASCAR endorsed Trump,"" Trump said. ""Can you believe that?"" At first glance, one might be tempted to believe it. Trump did, after all, win the endorsement of NASCAR’s CEO, Brian France, and several current or retired drivers, including Chase Elliott and Mark Martin. Martin introduced Trump at Monday’s rally. But France has made it clear, in an email to NASCAR employees, that his endorsement was merely his own. ""This is my personal and not a corporate position,"" he wrote, according to Motorsport, an online news source that covers NASCAR. A NASCAR spokesperson didn’t immediately respond Monday after Trump’s comments, but a spokesman did tell The Charlotte Observer on March 1 – the day after France’s original endorsement – that NASCAR itself did not endorse Trump. Granted, it can be difficult to separate NASCAR and the France family. Brian France’s grandfather, Bill France Sr., founded NASCAR in 1948, and it has been controlled by the France family. In 2013, a spokesman told The Sporting News that NASCAR is a private company owned by the France family but the ownership structure was proprietary. The elder France endorsed another controversial presidential candidate, George Wallace, in 1972. But last summer, NASCAR pulled annual banquets from the Trump National Doral property in Florida, after Trump made controversial remarks about immigrants. And Trump seems to have missed France’s email. In his speech Monday, he doubled down on the murky claim of corporate support. ""I want to thank NASCAR,"" Trump said. ""And, you know, Brian France was with us last week at a venue and he got up on behalf of NASCAR. … For them to endorse me was really a great honor, so thank you very much."" Trump’s campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, acknowledged after the speech that NASCAR itself hasn’t endorsed Trump. Trump was in Concord ahead of the March 15 North Carolina primary election. The state is home to NASCAR and many of its racing teams, but support for NASCAR isn’t as high as it once was. According to a 2013 report by Public Policy Polling of Raleigh, about a third of North Carolinians consider themselves NASCAR fans. Among North Carolina natives, the poll found, that number rises to 39 percent. And NASCAR fans are heavily Republican. Among people who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, the poll found, 43 percent considered themselves NASCAR fans. Among 2012 supporters of Barack Obama, on the other hand, 21 percent called themselves NASCAR fans. Our ruling Donald Trump claimed multiple times in his speech Monday that he was endorsed by NASCAR. He was endorsed by its CEO, Brian France, who went out of his way to say it was merely a personal decision – a statement echoed by a company spokesman. Still, NASCAR is synonymous with the France family. And for several of its drivers, including well-known racer Mark Martin, to lend support also increases the public appearance of an endorsement. We rate this statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972E5C40>],/factchecks/2016/mar/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-claimed-nascars-endorsement-and-hes-n/

In Michigan, Hillary Clinton says Bernie Sanders 'was against the auto bailout'
","Sen. Bernie Sanders didn’t support the bailout that saved the auto industry, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said of her opponent ahead of the primary in Michigan, a state built on the auto business. ""He was against the auto bailout,"" Clinton said at a March 6 CNN debate in Flint, Mich. ""In January of 2009, President-elect Obama asked everybody in the Congress to vote for the bailout. The money was there and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry and 4 million jobs and to begin the restructuring. We had the best year that the auto industry has had in a long time. I voted to save the auto industry. He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry."" Sanders seemed skeptical of this line of critique.  ""Well, if you are talking about the Wall Street bailout, where some of your friends destroyed this economy,"" he responded. Immediately a bunch of readers asked us to look into this claim to see if Sanders really did oppose the auto bailout, which many people believe rescued major automakers struggling to stay afloat during the 2008 Great Recession. First we’ll lay out the auto bailout timeline, then we’ll explain Sanders’ votes. Basically, Sanders had two opportunities to show his support for auto bailout funds through Senate votes. He supported the bailout in one instance but not the other. In October 2008, Congress approved the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The money was intended to assist financial institutions, but it also ended up bailing out the auto industry. That December, Congress tried to pass a separate $14 billion bailout program specifically for the auto industry, which was in really bad shape. But the measure failed in the Senate, so President George W. Bush instead used his authority to allocate some of the TARP funds to General Motors and Chrysler. Just days before President Barack Obama started his first term in January 2009, some members of Congress tried to block the release of the the second half of the $700 billion TARP funds, a package that included some auto bailout money. The attempt failed, and the TARP funds went out to the banks and motor companies. So Sanders could have shown his support for the auto bailout in December 2008 when Congress tried and failed to pass an auto bailout and again in January 2009 when members considered blocking TARP funds. Sanders (and Clinton, too) voted in favor of the December separate auto bailout. ""I think it would be a terrible idea to add millions more to the unemployment rolls,"" Sanders said, according to Vermont Public Radio, explaining why he supported the measure. However — and this is what Clinton is talking about — Sanders voted to block the release of the second half of the TARP funding, including the auto bailout funds, while Clinton voted for the funds. (Sanders opposed and Clinton supported the initial TARP bill.) Sanders said he opposed bailout funding for financial firms, which is where the majority of TARP dollars were headed. ""I have strong reservations about continuing this bailout without strong taxpayer protections written into law,"" he said in a statement. ""I also object to using middle-class taxpayer money to bail out the exact same financial institutions whose greed and recklessness led to the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression."" It’s unclear how much of the second half of TARP funds Obama intended to use for the auto bailout at the time. In a letter to congressional leaders encouraging them to release the funds, Obama economic adviser Larry Summers said only that auto companies would ""only receive additional assistance in the context of a comprehensive restructuring designed to achieve long-term viability."" Both of Michigan’s then-senators, Democrats Debbie Stabenow and Carl Levin, advocated to continue TARP funding specifically to aid the auto industry, which has a heavy presence in their home state. Auto companies ended up receiving about about $85 billion in TARP funds, according to the New York Times. It’s possible the auto industry would not have received such a robust bailout if Congress had successfully blocked the second half of the TARP funds and withstood an Obama veto. HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER Our ruling Clinton said Sanders ""was against the auto bailout"" and ""voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry."" Sanders did vote against a set of funds that financed most of the auto bailout — though the funds’ primary purpose was bailing out Wall Street firms, which Sanders strongly opposed. The claim, though, leaves listeners with the impression that Sanders’ opposed bailing out the auto industry. But he voted in favor of providing auto companies with $14 billion, which was separate from the Wall Street bailout funds he opposed. That standalone measure failed.

Sanders overshoots on NAFTA job losses
","In a series of notably sharper exchanges between Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., had both candidates emphasizing their fundamental differences. After Clinton laid out how she would boost industrial jobs in America, partly by going after companies that aim to shift production overseas, Sanders accused her of finding ""religion on this issue, but it’s a little bit too late."" ""Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America,"" Sanders said. ""NAFTA, supported by the secretary, cost us 800,000 jobs nationwide, tens of thousands of jobs in the Midwest."" NAFTA is the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. It significantly reduced trade tariffs among the United States, Mexico and Canada. Hillary Clinton obviously had no vote on the deal, but in 1996, during her husband’s presidency, she did say ""I think NAFTA is proving its worth."" Since then, she has said it ""has not delivered"" and should be fixed. Our focus is whether in fact, the trade deal caused the loss of 800,000 American jobs. Competing studies The Sanders campaign pointed us to work by the Economic Policy Institute, a research group that gets about a quarter of its funding from unions. A 2014 report from the group found that from 1993 to 2013, ""the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada increased from $17 (billion) to $177.2 billion, displacing 851,700 U.S. jobs. All of the net jobs displaced were due to growing trade deficits with Mexico."" The author of that study, Robert Scott, said he went industry by industry and converted trade deficit and surpluses into an estimated number of jobs. Since the United States has a trade deficit with Mexico, it has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs to Mexico. But other analyses say the impacts were much less dramatic. HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy arm of Congress, summarized a number of studies on NAFTA’s legacy. That report said it is difficult to tease out the effects of the trade deal by itself. Factors such as economic growth, inflation and changes in exchange rates cloud the waters. That said, the report struck a measured tone. ""NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters,"" the report said. ""The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest."" A similar review published by the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reached the same conclusion. ""The net employment effects were relatively small, although there were adjustments across sectors displacing workers,"" the report said. In other words, jobs in certain industries, such as cars and electronics, might have suffered, but overall, the job impact was nominal. Economist Martin Baily at the Brookings Institution said Sanders’ number ""looks high,"" and observed that it’s possible that NAFTA has not cost the country any jobs. In 2014, a pair of researchers, Lorenzo Caliendo at Yale University and Fernando Parro at the Federal Reserve, drilled down to examine not just exchanges among the United States, Mexico and Canada, but how NAFTA affected trade around the world. In their model, if an industry exported more at a higher real price, then that was a win, or to use their terms, a positive impact on welfare. By that yardstick, NAFTA produced more gains for Mexico than the United States, but both countries were slightly better off. The China factor Economies are enormously complex systems and economists can reach different conclusions based on the factors they consider and the assumptions they bring to bear. Part of what makes the legacy of NAFTA challenging to assess is that in the last year of his presidency, Bill Clinton signed legislation granting China permanent normal trade relations. From 2000 on, this had an enormous impact on trade between the two nations. That overlaps with about half the period when analysts have tried to gauge the effect of NAFTA. A 2014 report published by the Federal Reserve Board linked that change to major job losses in the United States. It ""reduced total employment growth by -19.5 percentage points from 1997 to 2007 versus the prior decade,"" the authors wrote. The impact was nearly twice as large for production workers than for non-production workers, but for both groups, the legislation reduced job growth. Our ruling Sanders said that NAFTA, which Clinton used to support, cost the U.S. economy 800,000 jobs. There is a report from a left-leaning policy group that reached that conclusion. On the other hand, many other nonpartisan reports found that the trade deal produced neither significant job losses nor job gains. This is a result of competing economic models and the challenges of teasing out the effects of NAFTA from everything else that has taken place in the economy. The report Sanders cited is an outlier, and his use of its findings ignores important facts that would give a different impression. We rate his statement Mostly False. Editor's note: Soon after we published, we heard from Robert Scott of EPI and added his comments.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AC26C0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/07/bernie-sanders/sanders-overshoots-nafta-job-losses/

Hillary Clinton: Cleveland has higher rates of lead poisoning than Flint
","The Democratic debate in Flint, Mich., opened with a discussion of the city’s lead poisoning crisis, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Flint isn’t the only place where serious action is needed. ""We have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water, including lead, are way above what anybody should tolerate,"" Clinton said. ""We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint. So I’m not satisfied with just doing everything we must do for Flint. I want to tackle this problem across the board."" We were curious about Clinton’s claim that Cleveland has it worse. If you stopped listening there, you might have thought she was saying the tap water in Ohio’s second-largest city is also contaminated with lead — which is not the case. Later in the debate, Clinton made a point of mentioning lead coming from other sources, too: ""I want us to have an absolute commitment to getting rid of lead wherever it is because it's not only in water systems, it's also in soil, and it's in lead paint that is found mostly in older homes,"" she said. The Clinton campaign cited an article in the Cleveland Plain Dealer, and we found other reports and data that back her point. Lead poisoning leads to serious neurological and behavioral effects ranging from shortened attention spans and developmental disabilities to coma and even death. While no level of lead is safe in children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses a reference level of 5 micrograms of lead per one deciliter of blood as an indicator of higher-than-usual blood lead levels. According to the CDC, 2.5 percent of American children age 5 and under — about a half million kids — test at this level. Residents of Flint have been consuming tap water with lead since 2014, when the city switched its water source to the polluted Flint River to save money. In 2015, 4 percent of all kids and 6.3 percent of kids in high-risk areas had elevated blood lead levels, according to an analysis by Monica Hanna-Attisha, a researcher at Flint’s Hurley Children’s Hospital. Clinton has a point that many other American cities are dealing with the toxin. Lead-contaminated tap water has run through faucets in Washington D.C., Durham, N.C., Lakehurst Acres, Maine, Jackson, Miss. and other places throughout the years. But in most places, lead poisoning elsewhere is mainly due to lead-based paint in older houses. That’s the case for Cleveland, where a whopping 14.2 percent of kids tested at the reference level in 2014, according to the Cuyahoga County Board of Health. In the county, 10.3 percent of kids had elevated blood levels. Cleveland and Cuyahoga County aren’t exactly outliers. Looking at 2014 CDC surveillance data for 1,425 counties in 29 states, 288 counties have higher rates of lead poisoning than Flint. (We should caution that the data is far from perfect; for example, 100 percent of kids in Colfax County, N.M., tested positive, but the sample size was just 33 kids.) What’s more, 15 counties had the same percentage or higher rates of poisoned children as Flint, but at double the reference blood-lead level:  Our ruling Clinton said, ""We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint."" In Flint, 4 percent of all kids and 6.3 percent of kids in high-risk areas in Flint tested positive for lead poisoning in 2015. In Cleveland, that rate was 14.2 percent in 2014. However, the lead in Cleveland came from paint, not water, and Clinton's initial phrasing made that unclear. With this caveat, we rate Clinton's claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097282300>],/factchecks/2016/mar/07/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-cleveland-has-higher-rates-lead-po/

Hillary Clinton: Barack Obama set new Wall Street fundraising record when he first ran for president
","Just because you've taken money from Wall Street doesn't mean you can't regulate Wall Street. That was the message Hillary Clinton tried to promote during the March 6 debate with fellow Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in Flint, Mich. Sanders has attacked Clinton for accepting a lot of contributions from the financial industry, an industry both Sanders and Clinton say they want to tighten the screws on. Sanders argued that you can't do it when you've accepted as much money from Wall Street as Clinton has. Clinton countered Sunday night that the case of President Barack Obama shows you can. ""President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had,"" she said. ""And when it came time to stand up to Wall Street, he passed and signed the toughest regulations since the Great Depression, with the Dodd-Frank regulations."" For this fact-check, we're looking at whether Obama set a record for campaign donations from Wall Street in 2008. Given the context, we're only looking at direct contributions made to candidates, not super PACs or other organizations that can accept unlimited contributions. Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin cited a 2012 analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group that tracks campaign donations. It found that Obama received $44.3 million in 2008 from the ""finance, insurance and real estate"" sector. Four years earlier, George W. Bush had received $36 million. Adjusted for inflation, Bush received $41.1 million in 2008 dollars, making Bush and Obama close, but still putting Obama ahead. But the ""finance, insurance and real estate"" sector includes industries that go beyond what people traditionally think of as Wall Street. The Center for Responsive Politics has told PolitiFact that the best way to determine what Wall Street is donating is to look at donations from the ""securities and investment"" category. By that measure, Obama received $17.3 million in 2008 (with Republican Sen. John McCain a distant second at $9.7 million and Clinton in that cycle at third, at $7.5 million). Four years earlier, George W. Bush received $10 million, which is $11.4 million in 2008 dollars. So when it comes to Wall Street contributions, Obama broke the record in 2008. But Obama's support of financial reform may have cost him. When he ran for reelection in 2012, Wall Street sent him $10 million less. He received $7 million for that election cycle. It was Republican Mitt Romney who set the new record — $23.7 million, which would be $22.2 in 2008 dollars. And, for the record, in the current race, the most recent data supplied by the center's website, OpenSecrets.org, shows Clinton with $3.4 million from the securities and investment industry, Marco Rubio with $1.6 million, Ted Cruz with $754,583, John Kasich with $274,317 and Sanders with $108,761. Our ruling Clinton said, ""President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had."" Adjusting for inflation, Obama garnered about $3 million more than George W. Bush if you look at the broad ""finance, insurance and real estate"" sector. But using the ""securities and investment"" category, a tighter measure of Wall Street contributions, Obama clearly set a new record in 2008. Yet that record only lasted four years. Romney upped that ante by $5 million in 2012. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

Is Donald Trump right that the Great Wall of China is 2,000 years old and 13,000 miles long?
","One of Donald Trump’s signature policy proposals during the 2016 presidential campaign has been to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. In remarks after the Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses, Trump drew an explicit comparison between his proposed wall and the Great Wall of China. ""They say you’ll never be able to build a wall,"" Trump said on March 2, 2016. ""Well, it’s 2,000 miles but we really need 1,000 miles. The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago, is 13,000 miles, folks, and they didn’t have Caterpillar tractors, because I only want to use Caterpillar, if you want to know the truth, or John Deere. … We can do that so beautifully. And this is going to be a serious wall. This is going to be a high wall. This is going to be a very serious wall."" A number of people asked us to check whether Trump’s description of the Great Wall -- that it was built 2,000 years ago and that it’s 13,000 miles long -- was accurate. After checking with scholars of the period, we found that the numbers Trump are grounded in reality, but that there’s a lot of nuance that’s been lost in the process. The wall was ‘built 2,000 years ago’ As a starting point for the Great Wall’s construction, ""2,000 years ago"" has some merit. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and other groups say that around 220 B.C., efforts began to link together existing earthen walls on modern-day China’s northern frontier. But today, those early walls are barely discernible, if at all. Better constructed portions of the wall only came into existence much later -- and over many centuries, said Lynn A. Struve, an East Asian historian at Indiana University and author of Time, Temporality, And Imperial Transition: East Asia From Ming To Qing.. ""Almost every dynasty contributed to building the wall,"" said Arthur Waldron, an East Asian historian at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of the seminal 1992 volume, The Great Wall of China: From History to Myth. (The bottom portion of the figure below shows the full historical timeline.)    Indeed, the most familiar and best-preserved portions of the wall are more recent than Trump indicated -- only 300 to 600 years old. They were built during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), when the Great Wall became the world's largest military structure, according to UNESCO. ""The Great Wall you see today was almost entirely built in the 1500s under the Ming dynasty,"" said Kenneth M. Swope, a University of Southern Mississippi historian and author of A Dragon's Head and a Serpent's Tail: Ming China and the First Great East Asian War, 1592-1598. The wall’s length ‘is 13,000 miles’ In citing this figure, Trump can point to an official statistic. In 2012, China's State Administration of Cultural Heritage released a five-year-long study that the wall is 13,170 miles long -- much longer than the previous estimate of 5,500 miles, which was limited to the Ming-era structures. But this number should be taken with a grain of salt, experts said. For starters, this includes all of the wall, not just the Ming-era portions. And just a fraction of these 13,000 miles includes intact walls. And contrary to the wall in Trump’s proposal, the wall ""is not contiguous,"" Swope said. (This can be seen in the map portion of the graphic above.) Waldron calls the Chinese government’s estimate the most generous measurement. ""China is endlessly puffing up the wall for the benefit of tourism,"" he said. He said his fairest estimate would be perhaps 1,700 miles, ""with a solid line"" around Beijing and ""elsewhere a dotted line."" In the view of the scholars we contacted, the wall also doesn’t serve as a particularly good model for Trump’s point. Historically, trade was generally a far more successful policy than warfare. Indeed, walls didn’t stop the Mongols and the Manchus from crossing the frontier and causing serious trouble, including, ultimately, the fall of the Ming and the establishment of the Manchu, or Qing, dynasty that lasted from 1644 to 1912. ""The wall never worked,"" said Michael Szonyi, a professor of Chinese history at Harvard University and author of Practicing Kinship: Lineage and Descent in Late Imperial China. Waldron, who added that he is sympathetic to the notion of closing off U.S. borders more completely, nonetheless agreed with Szonyi’s assessment of the Great Wall. The Great Wall ""didn't do what it was supposed to do, it was enormously costly, and there's no question that it caused great suffering among the people who built it,"" he told Mother Jones magazine. He added to PolitiFact, ""I would say Trump is one of a long train of Western and Chinese people who bought into the mythology of the wall."" Our ruling Trump said that the Great Wall of China was ""built 2,000 years ago"" and ""is 13,000 miles"" long. He has repeated two figures that are widely cited and, superficially at least, seem credible. But when we ran them by several experts in Chinese history, we found that the reality is more nuanced. Major unifications of early portions of the wall did occur about 2,200 years ago. However, the wall was built over the course of many centuries, and the best preserved, most iconic portions of the wall are a lot younger -- roughly 500 years old. Meanwhile, a Chinese government survey from 2012 reported a total length of 13,000 miles. However, this figure includes many bits and pieces of wall, some of them quite isolated. Trump’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978167C0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-great-wall-china-2000-years-old/

Bill Clinton says percentage of gun-owning households dropping every year
","There’s a bottom-line reason why the National Rifle Association doesn’t want to broaden background checks on gun buyers, former President Bill Clinton said during a recent rally in Richmond for his wife’s presidential campaign. ""The NRA and the gun manufacturers know that every year there is a slightly smaller percentage of American households owning guns,"" Clinton, a Democrat, said during the Feb. 24 speech at the Hippodrome theater.   ""So what they have to do every time somebody says ‘Would you please give us three days to do a background check and maybe a little more if we don’t have consolidated mental health records’ … they go nuts and say, ‘Well this is the beginning of the end. They’re violating the Second Amendment. They’re coming after your gun.’"" We wondered whether Clinton was correct that, every year, there’s a slow and steady decline in the proportion of households that own guns. The former president’s spokesman, Angel Urena, pointed us to one article on The Huffington Post and another in The New York Times about gun ownership. Both items focused on findings about gun ownership in polls conducted by the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago. Since 1973, the survey has asked people whether anyone in their home owns a gun. The results show that the high-water mark was in 1977, when 50.4 percent of households had firearms. Since then, the survey found there’s been a long-term decline in the percentage of households with guns, which dropped to 31 percent in 2014 - the latest survey available. The decline largely occurred during the 1990s. Researchers say much of the long-term decline was caused by a drop in the popularity of hunting. But contrary to Clinton’s claim, the percentage of households possessing firearms hasn’t decreased every year. Since 2000, the percentage has been fairly static, bobbing slightly up and down. Here’s what the survey has found in its more recent polls. Keep in mind the survey is conducted every two years. The figures show the percentage of households with guns: •2000;  32.4 percent •2002:  33.5 percent •2004:  34.7 percent •2006:  33.1 percent •2008:  34 percent •2010:  31.1 percent •2012:  33.1 percent •2014:  31 percent   Gun rights advocates have criticized the survey’s gun ownership number as being too low. The NRA estimates that 40 percent to 45 percent of households have guns. Gallup also has been surveying household gun ownership for decades but comes up with different percentages and a different long-term trend than the General Social Survey. Unlike the General Social Survey, it finds almost no long-term decrease in gun-owning households: It was 43 percent in the 1972 and 41 percent last year. In between, the roller coaster trend line constantly rises and falls. The pattern essentially holds up if you look at recent years: 41 percent of households owned guns in 2000 and in 2015. In between, there are many peaks and valleys. Let’s look at one last series of polls on household gun ownership by the Pew Research Center. It found that 45 percent of households owned a gun in 1993, and that decreased to 33 percent in 2013 - the last year Pew surveyed on the question. But as with the other polls, the decrease is barely discernable when starting at 2000. That year, 35 percent of households had firearms. Fast forward to 2013, when it was 33 percent. In between those two years, the percentages once again bob up and down. How should we take all these confusing poll results? Perhaps with a grain of salt. Pew said in a March 2013 report that there’s ""no definitive data source from the government or elsewhere on how many Americans own guns or how gun ownership rates have changed over time. Also, public opinion surveys provide conflicting results: Some show a decline in the number of households with guns, but another does not."" Our ruling Bill Clinton says ""every year there is a slightly smaller percentage of American households owning guns."" Although polls on gun-owning households are erratic, you can make a plausible argument they show a long-range downward trend. Clinton cites a series of surveys by the University of Chicago that show a drop of 19 percentage points since the early 1970s. Another set of polls by Gallup show the five-decade drop is 2 percentage points. A third series of polls by Pew shows a decrease of 12 percentage points since 1993. But much of the downward movement occurred in the 1990s, and Clinton goes overboard by saying the percentage is going down ""every year."" All three surveys show the yearly percentages have been fluctuating in recent years and that, since 2000, the drop is about 1 or 2 percentage points. We rate Clinton’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A464B00>],/factchecks/2016/mar/07/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-percentage-gun-owning-households/

Trump acts not treason and GOP platform, reducing Ukraine support, doesn’t officially appease Putin
","The progressive veterans advocacy group VoteVets made several accurate statements in an attack ad that seeks to tie former President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans to Russian President Vladimir Putin. But it followed up those statements with an exaggerated and misleading conclusion.  Here are the ad’s central claims:  ""Remember, Donald Trump was impeached for threatening to withhold military aid from Ukraine."" This is accurate. The House on Dec. 18, 2019, impeached Trump on two charges — abuse of power, in holding up security assistance and a White House meeting to put pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and obstruction of Congress to cover up that campaign. ""And remember, 52 out of 53 Republican senators voted to let Trump get away with it."" This, too, is accurate. The Senate on Feb. 5, 2020, acquitted Trump of both charges. The only Republican voting to convict was Utah’s Mitt Romney, on the abuse of power charge. The ad, launched six days after Russia invaded Ukraine, then ends with an incendiary claim that lacks the same level of accuracy. It declared: ""Donald Trump’s appeasement of Putin wasn’t just a personal act of treason, it’s the Republican Party’s official position."" What the ad described as Trump’s appeasement of Putin did not amount to treason, because Trump’s acts did not occur during wartime or during an armed rebellion. The U.S. Constitution mentions very few crimes specifically, but is clearly defines treason: ""Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court. ""The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted."" On the most basic level, treason has to occur in wartime, or during an armed rebellion against the U.S. government. While there are tensions between Putin and the United States amid Russia’s war in Ukraine, President Joe Biden has been very pointed in saying the United States would not join the conflict.  Trump faced accusations of treason after he and Putin held a news conference on July 16, 2018 following a one-on-one meeting in Helsinki, Finland. Asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to the allegations of Russia meddling in the elections, Trump said: ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be."" Trump later claimed he misspoke, saying: ""The sentence should have been, ‘I don't see any reason why I wouldn't, or, why it wouldn't be Russia.’"" To back the second part of its claim, VoteVets, whose senior advisers include former National Security Council official Alexander Vindman, cited the Republican Party’s change of position on arming Ukraine.  In 2016, as Trump claimed the Republican nomination for president, the GOP originally wrote a platform that was to call for providing Ukraine with weapons in addition to the substantial nonlethal aid the U.S. already provides, news outlets reported at the time. After Trump surrogates reportedly intervened, the final passage supported ""providing appropriate assistance"" to Ukraine, but didn't mention providing arms to the government in Kiev, the Los Angeles Times reported. PolitiFact found there was evidence that Trump’s campaign was involved in making the change. VoteVets argued that appeasing Putin is the GOP’s official position because of that platform change; because Romney was the only Republican senator who voted to convict Trump; and because the Republican National Committee decided not to adopt a 2020 platform, leaving the 2016 platform in place. The 2016 platform softened language on helping Ukraine’s armed forces, but issued warnings to Russia and complained that ""a weak (Obama) Administration has invited aggression"": ""We support maintaining and, if warranted, increasing sanctions, together with our allies, against Russia unless and until Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are fully restored. We also support providing appropriate assistance to the armed forces of Ukraine and greater coordination with NATO defense planning…. ""Repressive at home and reckless abroad, their (Kremlin officials’) policies imperil the nations which regained their self-determination upon the collapse of the Soviet Union. We will meet the return of Russian belligerence with the same resolve that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. We will not accept any territorial change in Eastern Europe imposed by force, in Ukraine, Georgia, or elsewhere, and will use all appropriate constitutional measures to bring to justice the practitioners of aggression and assassination."" In 2020, the party declined to adopt a platform at all. Instead, the Republican National Committee reiterated its ""strong support"" for Trump and his administration. In 2022, Trump praised Putin, at least tactically, for his invasion of Ukraine. He said: ""I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, ‘This is genius.’ Putin declares a big portion of Ukraine, Putin declares it as independent. So, Putin is now saying, ‘It’s independent,’ a large section of Ukraine. I said, ‘How smart is that?’ And he’s going to go in and be a peacekeeper.… That’s the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen. There were more army tanks than I’ve ever seen. They’re going to keep peace, all right. No, but think of it. Here’s a guy who’s very savvy… I know him very well. Very, very well."" Many Republicans, however, have not embraced Trump’s remarks. Former Vice President Mike Pence told GOP donors, according to CNN: ""There is no room in this party for apologists for Putin. There is only room for champions of freedom.""  Asked about Trump’s comments, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said: ""What President Putin did as a ruthless thug is just invade — invaded another sovereign country and killed thousands of innocent people.""  Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., said about Trump’s comments: ""Putin is a murderous thug and I think the world is now seeing that. That’s my view of it and I think that’s going to be most Americans’ view of it. That was before, and will be for sure after, what we’re seeing on display."" Other Republican lawmakers have moved to provide arms to Ukraine in the wake of the invasion or to stop the U.S. from buying energy from Russia and other sanctions. ""Trump wanted to create a different relationship with Russia, because none of the traditional barriers to cooperation, such as human rights, violating the territorial integrity of the neighbors, or kleptocracy, bothered him,"" said Yuval Weber, a professor at Texas A&M University's Bush School of Government and Public Service in Washington. ""He was much more interested in leveraging Russia against China and shaping a less constrained international order that would allow larger powers to run roughshod over others, without the limitations of international law, institutions, or norms."" VoteVets said: ""Donald Trump's appeasement of Putin wasn't just a personal act of treason, it's the Republican Party's official position."" Trump’s acts regarding Ukraine that resulted in his impeachment did not rise to the level of treason. And the Republican Party does not have an official position to appease Putin.  In 2016, the party removed from its platform language about arming Ukraine in its fight against Russia, but the platform contained language threatening action against any future Russian aggression.  Meanwhile, as Trump has said complimentary things about Putin, other Republican leaders have heavily criticized Putin’s actions.  The statement contains only an element of truth.

Fact-checking Biden’s claim that there are 9,000 unused oil drilling permits
","President Joe Biden said that his policies have not made the U.S. less equipped to withstand the impact of the ban on Russian energy imports. He contended that the onus is on U.S. oil and gas companies that have permits to begin drilling, but haven’t started. ""It’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production,"" Biden said March 8 in a speech announcing a U.S. ban on Russian oil imports. Biden said that companies pumped more oil in the U.S. during his first year in office than during his predecessor’s first year and that we were on track for record oil production next year. Then Biden pivoted to point the finger at the industry: ""In the United States, 90% of onshore oil production takes place on land that isn’t owned by the federal government. And of the remaining 10% that occurs on federal land, the oil and gas industry has millions of acres leased,"" Biden said. ""They have 9,000 permits to drill now. They could be drilling right now, yesterday, last week, last year. They have 9,000 to drill onshore that are already approved.""  Biden said that the companies are not using these permits to drill. ""These are the facts. We should be honest about the facts.""  Is Biden sharing all the facts here? He’s right on the numbers of permits but what that means is a little more complicated than his statement suggests. The industry could move forward with the permits that it has that are currently unused and could ramp up domestic oil production to replace Russian oil, but these moves take time. The U.S. has more than 24 million acres under lease to oil and gas companies onshore — close to half are not producing.  Before drilling can occur, the lease holder has to get a federal permit. At the end of 2021, there were 9,173 approved and available permits to drill on federal and Indian lands. Those permits include those issued under Biden and those still active from Trump’s administration and potentially before, said Josh Axelrod, of the National Resources Defense Council. Companies don’t have to immediately begin drilling as their leases last 10 years and can be extended beyond that.  From a federal regulatory standpoint, once a permit is approved, industry can proceed.  The president suggested the onus is on the industry to start drilling. But it’s not as simple as Biden made it seem, because there are some steps before companies begin production. Companies have to contract rigs to drill the wells, and build a sufficient inventory of permits before rigs are contracted, said Jennifer Pett, a spokesperson for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, a trade group that represents oil and natural gas producers. ""Producers also have to put a drilling plan together, secure rights of way and work with state and private landowners,"" Pett said. Thousands of unused permits are not uncommon in any presidential administration.  Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank, said firms are trying to assess the durability of the global rebound. ""They have to be sure that the costly investment (and time) that it takes to turn a lease into a producing well is worth it."" Oil and gas companies can raise funds from investors by not drilling on leases with proven reserves, said Hugh Daigle, an associate professor at the University of Texas’ Hildebrand Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering. There is actually an incentive for the companies not to develop these resources because for publicly traded companies, these reserves get reported and influence market valuation, Daigle said. ""Sometimes there might not really even be producible oil and gas on a lease,"" Daigle said. ""Companies sometimes hold leases as a bit of a mind game with their competitors, or even just because they didn’t properly assess the production potential prior to leasing due to lack of data or that sort of thing."" In 2020, the oil bust created worker and supply shortages and caused companies to cut their budgets. Investors remain reluctant to invest in fossil fuels. Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James, told CNN Business that ""oil and gas companies do not want to drill more.""  ""They are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends, to do more share buybacks instead of the proverbial 'drill, baby, drill,' which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago. Corporate strategy has fundamentally changed."" Experts also suggested that drilling domestically is more costly than drilling overseas, which could further deter oil companies in the U.S. from upping production.  ""While the cost to extract one barrel in Saudi Arabia is somewhere around $10 or $15, in West Texas it can be as high as $70,"" Gernot Wagner, an associate professor of environmental studies at New York University, told PolitiFact. ""So it simply wasn’t profitable to drill with oil below $70. With oil at $120 or more, drilling there is wildly profitable."" Biden has a point that the U.S. produced more during his first year than Trump’s first year. During Biden’s first year in office, the U.S. produced an average of about 11 million barrels of crude oil per day compared to Trump’s 9 million barrels per day in his first year. The average barrels of crude oil produced per day spiked during Trump’s subsequent years, swelling to almost 12.3 million in 2019. The U.S. Energy Information Administration in January forecasted that U.S. oil production will average 12.4 million barrels per day during 2023, surpassing the record high for domestic crude oil production set in 2019.  Biden said the oil industry has ""9,000 permits to drill now. They could be drilling right now, yesterday, last week, last year."" Biden’s number is correct: There are 9,137 approved permits to drill on federal and Indian land, and the oil industry could use those permits and drill. However, once the permit is approved, drilling doesn’t start overnight. Some companies choose not to drill for corporate reasons — because they can raise funds from investors by not drilling on leases with proven reserves. Having thousands of unused drilling permits is not something that is unique to Biden’s tenure.  We rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C14F300>],/factchecks/2022/mar/09/joe-biden/fact-checking-bidens-claim-there-are-9000-unused-o/

No, inflation has not cut Americans’ buying power in half
","Consumer prices for everyday goods such as gas, groceries and electricity have surged over the last year. But a Facebook post exaggerates how much inflation has impacted American wages. ""And just like that, your $15/hr doesn’t buy you as much as $7.50/hr did a year ago,"" claimed a text-post shared on Facebook. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While it’s true that this year’s inflation spike — the highest in 40 years — outpaced increases in wages, this claim vastly overstates how much Americans’ buying power has depreciated since 2021. Over the last two years, a record number of people have left their jobs for better pay and work environments as part of what’s been dubbed ""the Great Resignation."" To compensate for this, employers on average raised wages 5.7% over the last year, the fastest pace since 2007, according to the Department of Labor. However, these pay increases have not kept up with the recent inflation hike. In January, the Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose 7.5% compared to a year ago. This is the highest inflation rate since 1982, when Ronald Reagan was in his first term as president. When accounting for inflation, real average hourly earnings fell by 1.7% from January 2021 to January 2022, the Labor Department reported in February. With this 7.5% inflation rate, a person who made $7.50 an hour in 2021 would need to earn $8.06 an hour this year in order to have the same buying power they did last year, according to the Labor Department’s CPI inflation calculator. That’s still about $7 less than the Facebook post claims a person would need to earn to have the same buying power. If $7.50 an hour wage last year were now equal to more than $15 an hour, that would mean inflation skyrocketed at a rate of 100%, far above any increase seen in U.S. history. A Facebook post claimed: ""And just like that, your $15/hr doesn’t buy you as much as $7.50/hr did a year ago."" Inflation rose 7.5% over the last year, a 40-year high but still far below what the claim suggests. A person would need to earn just over $8 an hour — not more than $15 an hour — to have the same buying power as a $7.50 hourly wage in 2021. We rate this claim False.

Did N.Y. state park attendance set a record during the pandemic?
","In a late January press release, New York State Sen. Rob Ortt touted the attendance figures at New York state parks during 2021. ""With the ongoing pandemic, our State Park attendance is at the highest it’s ever been,"" Ortt said in a Jan. 22 press release. In the press release, Ortt was urging Gov. Kathy Hochul and Erik Kulleseid, commissioner of the state office of parks, recreation, and historic preservation to end a hiring freeze for park police. Ortt’s statement caught our eye because many types of travel have been reduced since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. It turns out that Ortt was correct. (His office did not respond to an inquiry.) Ortt made the statement before Hochul publicly announced the state’s new park attendance figures. In a subsequent press release, Hochul said that New York state parks had hit record-high attendance levels in 2021, breaking the record set during the previous year, 2020. (The state lists attendance at state parks on its website going back to 2003.) New York state parks had more than 78.4 million visitors in 2021, an increase of just over 427,000 from the 2020 level of just over 78 million. In turn, the 2020 figure increased by about 910,000 over the 2019 level. Park attendance has increased consistently in recent years. In fact the state has not seen an annual decrease in park attendance since 2013.  That said, the annual increases during the pandemic were smaller than the increases prior to the pandemic. For instance, between 2018 and 2019, the state parks’ attendance increased by over 2.9 million visitors, year over year. And between 2017 and 2018, state park attendance increased by over 2.6 million visitors.  Why, even with the pandemic, have increases continued? Measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 are believed to have kept state park attendance increasing during the pandemic, which began in March 2020.  Jason Schnittker, a professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, said he believes parks allowed people to socialize while feeling safe from getting infected.  ""State parks are open-air, inexpensive, large and easy to social distance within, and very attractive in summer, fall, winter, and spring. At some point, the urge to get out of the house was overwhelming,"" Schnittker said. ""I also suspect many people went to parks with someone else — as in an appropriately social distanced social event — and social support is very good for mental and physical health. It's not good to be isolated in your apartment all the time."" He added that the increase in attendance provided multiple benefits. ""Getting out in nature can be very relaxing, even for those who are not outdoor enthusiasts,"" he said. ""The other dimension is exercise. Even moderate exercise, like walking or hiking, is good for your health."" Ortt said, ""With the ongoing pandemic, our State Park attendance is at the highest it’s ever been."" Official numbers show that New York state park attendance hit a record in 2021, after hitting a record in 2020. This record was set despite reduced travel during the pandemic, although the desire to congregate outside may have served to boost park attendance as COVID-19 was circulating.

Ben Shapiro claimed Biden’s job figures from 2021 didn’t beat nonpartisan projections. That’s wrong
","Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro delved into a litany of disagreements with President Joe Biden in a YouTube video he called ""The Real State of the Union."" One claim that caught our eye in Shapiro’s response to Biden’s State of the Union was that Biden’s American Rescue Plan didn’t lead to a single job. In fact, Shapiro said, the United States added fewer jobs in 2021 than economists had predicted if Biden did absolutely nothing. ""And Joe Biden told you that his American Rescue Plan — his massive boondoggle stimulus plan — ‘created jobs. Lots of jobs.’ He said he created 6.5 million jobs. That is another lie,"" Shapiro said March 1. ""There is no evidence Biden’s spending produced one job. Nonpartisan projections for job growth in 2021, not including that American Rescue Plan, showed higher job growth than Biden produced."" We wondered if Shapiro’s claims about U.S. jobs in Biden’s first year were really true. Did they end up lower than nonpartisan predictions? Eric Quintanar, a writer and editor at the Daily Wire, which was founded by Shapiro, said Shapiro was referring to a February 2021 forecast from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO estimated 6,252,000 new jobs would be added for the year. It did not factor in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which Biden signed into law on March 11, 2021, providing millions of Americans with a third stimulus check and extending enhanced weekly federal employment benefits. (Nor did it forecast the delta and omicron variants of COVID-19 and the economic impact they would have.) When Shapiro delivered his ""Real State of the Union,"" the Bureau of Labor Statistics totaled 6,665,000 jobs created in 2021. That includes revisions from earlier estimates for November and December. Further revisions now show 6,743,000 new jobs created in all of 2021.

6,743,000 is more than 6,252,000 — 491,000 more. (The math only changes slightly if you measure from February 2021 through January 2022). February’s jobs report showed another 678,000 jobs were created. A report from Moody’s Analytics suggested the economy is on track to recover all the jobs lost during the pandemic by the second quarter of 2022, something it said would have taken another year without Biden’s plan. Either way, Shapiro said nonpartisan projections ""showed higher job growth than Biden produced."" And that’s not true. ""Did it create as many jobs as predicted? We don’t know yet. Predictions often fall short,"" said Kathleen Day, an author and lecturer at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. ""But was it a complete bust? I don’t think people would say that either."" There are still 2.1 million fewer people employed through February 2022 as there were in February 2020 before the pandemic, labor statistics show. And some economists blame Biden’s rescue plan for increased inflation. But Shapiro’s claim is based on outdated numbers. Quintanar of the Daily Wire pointed us to two articles to support Shapiro’s claim, but they were each written in January, and also used numbers before revisions were made by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (Revisions in both directions for the prior two months have been common this year.) The articles allege that Biden projected 10 million jobs, or 4 million jobs on top of the CBO’s projections. The Washington Post Fact Checker said Biden was touting a Moody’s projection from January 2021, which forecast 7.2 million jobs total if the plan was passed. Biden misspoke once when he said the ""law alone"" would create 4 million jobs. Was the American Rescue Plan responsible for the higher-than-projected job numbers? Most of the experts we spoke with said Shapiro is wrong that Biden didn’t create a single job, and it’s likely that Biden’s plan had some effect on job growth. One said the plan actually cost jobs because of enhanced unemployment benefits of $300 until early September. Several experts, even some who said Shapiro is wrong, said there is no real way to measure what effect the plan had.  Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s, told PolitiFact that Shapiro’s ""statement is way off base."" Moody’s Analytics said in a Feb. 24 analysis, which he co-authored, that the American Rescue Plan was responsible for adding more than 4 million jobs in 2021, and he expected that the economy should recover all jobs lost during the pandemic in the second quarter of 2022. The gross domestic product, or GDP, rose 5.7% in 2021, including 6.9% in the fourth quarter. Dean Baker, an economist at the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, said there was a huge surge in consumer spending and demand due to the rescue plan’s provisions. ""Given we had a huge increase in GDP in 2021 and a huge increase in jobs, saying the ARP didn't create jobs is like seeing a dead man with a bullet wound and a guy standing over him with a smoking pistol, and then saying we have no evidence the person was shot,"" said Baker, who called Shapiro’s claim ""not serious."" Day called Shapiro's claim ""negative magical thinking."" She said it will be a long time before we can measure the effects the stimulus plan had on job creation, but ""it just doesn't make any sense that it would be zero."" ""I don't think there’s any definitive data, one way or another,"" she said. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution, also said Biden’s policies boosted job growth. ""However, I do not know what percentage of the 6.5 million employment expansion was caused by the government’s fiscal and monetary policies,"" Burtless said. ""The percentage is almost certainly greater than 1%, however, which also means that Mr. Shapiro’s statement is almost certainly false."" Economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, former director of the CBO and chief economic policy adviser to John McCain’s presidential campaign in 2008, agrees that there’s no way to know for sure. ""The only genuine answer to that is to compare what went on in 2021 with what would have gone on if we didn’t have the American Rescue Plan,"" he said. ""And we don’t actually see that and so you’re always comparing the actual to some presumed alternative. And we don’t know what that alternative is. And that’s just the reality of this kind of statement."" Casey Mulligan, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, who served as chief economist for the Council of Economic Advisers in the Trump administration, agrees with Shapiro, arguing that Biden’s plan actually reduced employment by adding weekly payments of $300 after more people had returned to work. ""For more than a century, at least, economies recovered quickly from their recessions without massive bonuses for unemployment,"" Mulligan said. ""So you have to expect some recovery to have happened even if Biden had done nothing."" Trump’s CARES Act, signed into law in March 2020, also provided federal unemployment benefits of $600 a month in addition to what workers received from states through the end of July. The stimulus package he signed in December added an additional 11 weeks at $300 a month.  Biden’s plan, signed in March, extended the $300 benefit until Sept. 6, but 26 states ended the supplement as early as June, according to CNBC. One study in August found just a small uptick in job gains among states that ended the benefits, CNBC reported. PolitiFact looked at this question back in May and determined there’s no clear evidence more generous unemployment benefits deterred people from taking jobs. Shapiro said, ""There is no evidence Biden’s spending produced one job. Nonpartisan projections for job growth in 2021, not including that American Rescue Plan, showed higher job growth than Biden produced."" Most experts we spoke with disagreed with Shapiro's assertion that the economy didn’t add any jobs from the American Rescue Plan, though several said that we can’t really know for sure. But Shapiro was wrong about 2021 jobs numbers underperforming projections made before the law was passed; the economy added more jobs than anticipated. We rate the statement Mostly False. UPDATE, March 17, 2022: The Daily Wire updated its transcript of Shapiro’s speech following publication of this fact-check to note the following: ""The CBO originally estimated that 6,252,000 would be produced. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported a 6,743,000 net change in jobs for all of 2021. This contradicts the claim that jobs growth claims were higher than what Biden produced.""",[<zip object at 0x000002809A416740>],/factchecks/2022/mar/09/ben-shapiro/ben-shapiro-claimed-bidens-job-figures-2021-didnt-/

Oil production in Biden’s first year on par with Trump
","U.S. gas prices hit a high on March 8, and President Joe Biden warned Americans they may pay even more at the pump after he banned imports of oil from Russia to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for the invasion of Ukraine. Some on social media have long blamed Biden’s energy policies for rising gas prices — and Russia’s war on Ukraine provided more so-called fuel for the raging fire of online claims. ""Everyone here knows gas is high because they shut down production in the U.S. but here is an extremely simple breakdown for people with short memories,"" read a March 7 Facebook post. A graphic that accompanied the post included data that appears to be credited to the consumer website GasBuddy and showed prices steadily rose after Biden became president. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s because the post gets several things wrong. There are many factors at play in the steady climb in gas prices since Biden took office, including increased demand after pandemic lockdowns ended, inflation and, now, the war in Ukraine. But lower oil production in the U.S. isn’t one of them. America produced 11.185 million barrels of crude oil per day in 2021, compared with 11.283 million a year earlier under Trump. The amount produced in Biden’s first year exceeds the average daily amount produced under Trump from 2017 to 2018, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Biden did issue an executive order his first month in office that paused new oil and gas lease sales on government land pending a review, but that order was struck down by a federal judge in June. RELATED VIDEO Despite claims to the contrary, oil production was unphased in the U.S. following the order. And cancellation of the Keystone Pipeline didn’t impact production levels, as many Biden critics have alleged. In addition, Biden has surpassed Trump in issuing drilling permits on public land, the Washington Post reported in January. The graphic in the Facebook post misleadingly marks Nov. 26, 2020, as the date when Biden was ""installed."" That’s wrong.  Biden was declared winner of the Nov. 3, 2020, election on Nov. 7, 2020. And he took office on Jan. 20, 2021. Gas prices on Nov. 7, 2020, were $2.104 per gallon, according to GasBuddy, and rose to $2.408 per gallon on Jan. 20, 2021, Inauguration Day. Those figures appear to be in line with the data in the graphic, but that doesn’t mean the post’s conclusion is accurate. Patrick De Haan, an oil and gas products analyst for GasBuddy, said that users of its app and website can create graphics from its data. The one in the post was not produced by GasBuddy and De Haan took issue with the claim itself. He credited a rise in gas prices to COVID-19 pandemic economic recovery as well as the Russia-Ukraine war. A month into Biden’s presidency, PolitiFact began seeing claims that blamed Biden’s policies for increases in gas prices. But energy experts we spoke to said it was largely due to supply and demand rather than presidential policies. The coronavirus pandemic prompted a big fall in oil demand and gasoline prices, due to declines in driving and air travel. As the economy has slowly rebounded, growing demand has boosted prices at the pump. De Haan similarly said Biden’s policies are not a significant driver in the price increases, though they do have what he called ""optical impacts."" The national average cost for a gallon of gas in the U.S. was $4.173 as of March 8, breaking the record set in 2008, according to AAA. That’s 55 cents higher than it was a week earlier, about 72 cents higher than it was the same time in February, and about $1.40 higher than it was in March 2021, AAA numbers show. A Facebook post claims that Biden ""shut down production"" in the U.S., which is why gas prices are so high. The post also falsely claims Biden was ""installed"" in November, with a graphic showing that the rise in gas prices began under his watch. This is misleading, as Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2021. Oil production in the U.S. in 2021 was on par with 2020 production and exceeded yearly production from 2017-18, data shows. We rate this claim False. Correction (March 14, 2022): This post was corrected to show that crude oil production in Biden’s first year was higher than in two of four years under Trump, not three. The rating is unchanged.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097075080>],/factchecks/2022/mar/09/facebook-posts/oil-production-bidens-first-year-par-trump/

No proof for Val Demings claim that Marco Rubio backs tax hikes like those indicated in Scott’s plan
","Florida Sen. Rick Scott created fodder for Democrats like U.S. Rep. Val Demings in a race that could help determine which party controls the Senate. Demings, a former police chief who is running against Florida’s other senator, Republican Marco Rubio, responded to Scott’s ""11-point Plan to Rescue America"" by tying Rubio to it.  ""Marco Rubio and Rick Scott are planning to hike taxes on millions of Americans, including seniors and working class Floridians,"" the text in her ad on Facebook and Instagram says.  Below the text is a video in which a narrator says: ""Marco Rubio is following his party bosses, like Rick Scott, with his plan to raise taxes on Florida's working families, retirees and veterans."" The video, which Demings also posted on YouTube, even gives Rubio first billing by ending with: ""Say no to the Rubio-Scott tax hike."" But Rubio has not expressed support for Scott’s plan on taxes. To refer to the ""Rubio-Scott tax hike"" is particularly misleading. Let’s start with a recap of what Scott proposed.  Scott, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, introduced a plan for the GOP in which he said ""all Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount."" ""Currently over half of Americans pay no taxes,"" Scott’s plan said. While Scott did not make a specific tax hike proposal, experts said they could only conclude that the verbiage he used calls for raising income taxes on millions of Americans. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said that wasn’t happening: ""We will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people."" Scott’s plan appeared to allude to the millions of people who don’t owe any federal income tax, principally because they don’t earn enough income. An Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center analysis said that in 2020, 60.6% of all taxpayers paid no federal income tax. It estimated that the percentage for 2021 would stay high — at around 57.1%.  One expert said people who don’t pay income taxes include many retirees or people with disabilities who are collecting Social Security benefits and low-income working families. To back its claim about the tax hike, Demings’ ad quoted two news articles about Scott’s plan: ""a tax increase on millions of Americans"" in the Miami Herald; and ""largely the poor and retirees"" in the Orlando Sentinel. Rubio is not mentioned in those articles. We found no evidence that Rubio has endorsed Scott’s plan.  Demings’ campaign also did not cite any, but emphasized that Rubio had not offered a position on Scott’s plan. Several days after Scott’s plan was released, Rubio was asked about it and said: ""I have not seen the plan. I’ve read about it, but I think it’s good that people offer ideas. I’m not sure I agree with all of them. I don’t know all of the details of the plan."" Demings’ campaign cited a TV news report in which an anchor says Rubio ""supports the tax hike,"" but there was nothing in the report showing that Rubio had stated support. Rubio’s campaign told PolitiFact: ""Senator Rubio does not support raising taxes."" Demings, the former Orlando police chief, has served in the House since 2017. Rubio has served in the Senate since 2011 and ran for president in 2016.  Campaign watchers rate the race as ""lean Republican,""  ""battleground Republican"" and ""likely Republican.""   The Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans. Demings said Rubio ""is following his party bosses, like Rick Scott, with his plan to raise taxes on Florida's working families, retirees and veterans."" Scott released a plan that indicates support for raising income taxes on millions of Americans, but there is no evidence that Rubio backs such tax hikes. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979CC400>],/factchecks/2022/mar/09/val-demings/no-proof-val-demings-claim-marco-rubio-backs-tax-h/

Story that claims Putin bombed a Biden-owned villa and 'hammered' biolabs, pedophile rings is bogus

Claims about nefarious biolabs in Ukraine — some supposedly ""U.S. owned"" — have permeated social media since the Russian invasion.

Real Raw News’ stories are often republished by other sites that pass off the information as real news.  There are no U.S.-run biolabs in Ukraine. Ukraine is one of many former Soviet Union republics, and other countries, partnering with the U.S. Defense Department as part of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to improve public health laboratories and prevent the threat of outbreaks of infectious diseases.  While the U.S. may provide funding to upgrade or build labs in other countries, the labs are run by the partnering nations and the program’s goal is to prevent biological threats, not create them.

Claim that prescription drug costs have grown nearly twice as much as incomes is mostly on the money
","Prescription drug costs in the United States have long been a hot-button issue for voters. On July 9, 2021, Joe Biden signed an executive order aimed at enacting ""aggressive legislative reforms"" that would lower prescription drug prices. He had pledged to do so on the campaign trail. In Wisconsin, State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, has struck a similar theme. She hopes to face U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican, in November 2022. ""The skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs plagues Wisconsinites and harms Americans in every corner of the country. As pharmaceutical companies pull in record profits, folks are skipping pills to make their prescriptions last a little longer, while others are having to choose between their groceries and their life-saving medicine,"" Godlewski said in a Feb. 18, 2022 campaign statement  ""Here in Wisconsin, prescription drug costs grew at a pace of nearly twice as much as the average Wisconsinite's income from 2015-2019.""  The final part of Godlewski’s claim caught our attention. Have prescription drug costs grown at a pace of nearly twice as much as the average Wisconsinite's income? Let’s take a look.  When asked for backup to Godlewski’s claim, her campaign staff cited an AARP article title ""Prescription Drug Costs are Rising Nearly Twice as Fast as Wisconsinites’ Income."" AARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization active on issues that affect people age 50 and over.  The average annual cost of prescription drug treatment increased 26.3% between 2015 and 2019, while the annual income for Wisconsin residents only increased 13.9%,"" AARP reported.  But a check of the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey shows that the median income for Wisconsin residents increased 15.2%, from $55,638 in 2015 to $64,168 in 2019.  Why the discrepancy? The 13.9% increase applies to residents over the age of 50, while the 15.3% increase applies to all residents. So, Godlewski was generally on target, but overshot the mark a bit in her phrasing.  In Wisconsin, according to the 2020 ""Governor’s Task Force on Reducing Prescription Drug Prices"", prescription drugs were estimated to cost residents more than $1.3 billion overall in 2019. Meanwhile, an AARP graphic – ""Impact of High Rx Prices to Wisconsin Residents"" – looked at the increase in price for three specific medications between 2015-2020: Revlimid, a cancer treatment, went from $185,574 to $267,583, up 44% Victoza, a diabetes treatment, went from $7,936 to $11,300, up 42% Spiriva inhaler, used for asthma and COPD, went from $3,886 to $5,289, up 36% The report went on to state that retail prices for 76% of the most widely used brand name prescription drug products (198 of 260) had price increases in 2020 – and 92% of these price increases (183 of 198) were greater than the rate of general inflation in 2002, which was 1.3%.  Separately, a Feb. 25, 2022 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization focusing on national health issues, found prices increased faster than inflation for half of all drugs covered by Medicare in 2020. Godlewski said ""in Wisconsin, prescription drug costs grew at a pace of nearly twice as much as the average Wisconsinite's income from 2015-2019."" The average annual cost of prescription drug treatment increased 26.3% in that time frame. The increase in income for all Wisconsin residents was actually 15.2%. The figure Godlewski was citing is for those age 50 and over, whose income increased 13.9%.

Evan McMullin ad portraying GOP Utah Sen. Mike Lee as pro-Russia, anti-Ukraine is Mostly False
","Utah's U.S. Senate race is so unusual that some leading Democrats, believing no Democrat can defeat two-term Republican Sen. Mike Lee, are urging support for independent candidate Evan McMullin. McMullin, a former Republican who made news by raising more campaign money than Lee in the latest reporting period, attacked Lee with a TV ad over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The McMullin-narrated ad, which also ran on Facebook, opens by showing an undated NBC News headline that says: ""Russia launches invasion of Ukraine.""  Mixing the present tense and the past tense, McMullin said:  ""As the world rallies around Ukraine, Mike Lee was one of only two senators to oppose sanctions on Putin. Then he flew to the Kremlin and discussed dropping sanctions. Lee even opposed arming Ukrainians fighting for their lives."" Russia’s invasion is less than two weeks old, while Lee’s actions cited in the ad occurred years ago. Moreover, the ad mischaracterizes some of Lee’s actions. After participating in a March 5 video call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Lee said Zelensky is ""concerned not only about his own people, but he’s concerned about his neighbors, he’s concerned even about the Russians. Now, this is something that really differentiates him from Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin has never once indicated any degree of sympathy for the people of Ukraine or for perhaps anyone other than himself.""  In a statement to PolitiFact, Lee’s campaign said Lee ""stands with the people suffering from Putin’s aggression in Ukraine. He condemns this senseless, unprovoked violence and he is committed to keeping Americans safe."" The context is the February 2022 invasion, but the ad alludes to a vote Lee took five years ago. To back up the ad, McMullin’s campaign cited a 2017 vote by Lee and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., against imposing financial sanctions on Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The measure also condemned Russia's interventions in Ukraine and Syria, and allowed Congress to block the president from unilaterally lifting existing sanctions against Russia. The amendment became law.  Lee said at the time: ""The Russian sanctions amendment included funding for programs and support of policies that I believe are not effective at addressing problems in the U.S.-Russia relationship and have promoted progressive policies unrelated to countering Russia at the expense of American taxpayers."" This refers to a trip Lee made more than three years before the invasion. The ad cites news reports about Lee’s September 2019 trip to Moscow to meet with Konstantin Kosachev, head of the Russian Federation Council’s Foreign Affairs Committee. Lee told an NPR  reporter in Moscow during the visit that he wanted to maintain an open dialogue with Russia and said about U.S. sanctions against Russia: ""We need to assess from time to time how they're doing, what impact they're having."" The Russian state-affiliated  news agency Tass reported at the time that Lee discussed removing sanctions, leading the Salt Lake Tribune to run this headline: ""Report: Sen. Mike Lee discussed loosening sanctions against Russia during Moscow visit.""  Lee’s office said at the time that he and the Russian official discussed ""trade, security and religious liberty issues."" After returning from Moscow, Lee told the Deseret News that the official ""didn’t waste much (time) in getting to some of the grievances that he’s got. He complained almost right off the bat about Russian sanctions."" In a statement to PolitiFact in response to McMullin’s ad, Lee’s campaign said the Russian official advocated for a reduction in sanctions, and that Lee ""summarily dismissed this request and stated significant improvements in Russian policy, diplomacy and behavior would be required before a reduction in sanctions would be considered."" Lee’s campaign also pointed out that in January 2022, Lee voted for a Russia sanctions bill in connection with Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline that failed in the Senate. McMullin’s campaign cited seven no votes Lee cast — in 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019 (two votes) and 2020 to back this part of the claim. The campaign said that each measure contained financial aid for Ukraine.  But none of the votes was a specific vote for or against aid to Ukraine.  Rather, each measure contained numerous expenditures for a variety of purposes. For example, Lee’s 2020 vote was on a consolidated appropriations act that appropriated much more than foreign assistance; it included money for the U.S. departments of agriculture, commerce, justice, defense, energy and more. Voting no on an omnibus bill does not indicate opposition to each expenditure in the bill. Over the years, Lee has struck different tones on Ukraine. In August 2014, six months after Russian troops took control of Ukraine’s Crimea region, Lee advocated for increased production of U.S. oil and natural gas, paired with sanctions. Putin ""would never have dared do what he did if we were aggressively producing and exporting oil and natural gas. He would never have gotten away with it,"" Lee said. ""So, yeah, economic sanctions, we have to go there,"" but paired with the increased energy production.   In September 2019, after it was revealed that then-President Donald Trump, while withholding millions in aid to Ukraine, urged Zelensky on a call to investigate political rival Joe Biden, Lee downplayed the call. Lee said he didn’t think the call was ""a problem"" and argued it ""certainly doesn’t serve as the basis for impeaching and removing"" Trump. McMullin, a former CIA operative, was a Republican before running as an independent for president in 2016. He made news in February with reports showing he raised more campaign money than Lee in the final quarter of 2021.  Some leading Utah Democrats are urging Democrats to support McMullin, believing a Democrat can’t win statewide in the heavily Republican state. The Utah race could play a role in determining which party controls the Senate, which is now split 50-50. Campaign watchers rate the race as solid or safe Republican. Lee is also being challenged in Utah’s June 28 primary. The leading Republican challengers are former Utah state lawaker Becky Edwards and communications strategist Ally Isom. McMullin said: ""As the world rallies around Ukraine, Mike Lee was one of only two senators to oppose sanctions on Putin. Then he flew to the Kremlin and discussed dropping sanctions. Lee even opposed arming Ukrainians fighting for their lives."" The context is Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but Lee’s actions cited in the ad occurred years earlier, and the ad mischaracterizes some of those actions. Lee did vote in 2017 against sanctioning Russia. In 2019, he had talks with a Russian official in Moscow, but Lee suggested the discussion of dropping sanctions was fairly minimal. Seven votes cast by Lee dating back to 2014 were on spending bills with numerous provisions and are not evidence that Lee opposed specific provisions in the bills to provide aid to Ukraine. McMullin’s statement contains only an element of truth. We rate it Mostly False.

","In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a 2020 video of a Ukrainian lawmaker leveling unsubstantiated allegations against Biden is being presented as new in social media posts. The video, posted March 1 on Facebook, had a caption that said, ""Ukraine Press Release About Joe Biden."" The video featured Andrii Derkach, a member of Ukraine’s parliament, talking in front of a backdrop that says Interfax, the name of a Russian news agency. The video’s caption was later updated to add, ""I am not sure when this was released. Either way it warrants prayer because someone has been caught red handed."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The caption gives the misleading impression that Ukraine recently released information about Biden. In reality, the footage was from a press conference held in May 2020 — and it was orchestrated not by Ukraine, but by Derkach, who U.S. officials have described as an active Russian agent, the Associated Press reported. Derkach was sanctioned by both the U.S. and Ukraine after being accused of interfering in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. During the 2020 press conference, Derkach revealed audio recordings of 2015 phone conversations between then-Vice President Biden and then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. An Interfax story claimed the recordings revealed ""the receipt of ""$1 billion in exchange for maintaining Burisma schemes and international corruption."" Derkach was advancing a claim, also pushed by former President Donald Trump and his supporters, that Biden tried to protect Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company where his son, Hunter Biden, served on the board of directors. The unfounded allegation was that Biden withheld funding to Ukraine until the country’s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired, because Shokin had launched a criminal investigation into Burisma. ""(T)he corruption theories have been discredited because Shokin did not have an active investigation into Hunter Biden’s work and because Joe Biden, in seeking Shokin’s firing, was representing the official position of the Obama administration, Western allies and many in Ukraine who perceived the prosecutor as soft on corruption,"" the AP reported. And the audio recordings released by Derkach ""shed relatively little new light on Biden’s actions in Ukraine,"" the Washington Post reported. The AP concurred, noting that the recordings ""largely confirm Biden’s account of his dealings in Ukraine."" The caption on a Facebook video says, ""Ukraine Press Release About Joe Biden,"" and includes video footage of a press conference featuring Derkach.  The caption implies that Ukraine recently released information about Biden. But the video featured in the post is from a press conference held in May 2020 and orchestrated by Derkach, who has been described by U.S. officials as an active Russian agent. During the press conference, Derkach revealed audio tapes that he said served as evidence of Biden’s misuse of American taxpayer money. But the recordings corroborated Biden’s own account of his dealings in Ukraine. We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B4F9C0>],/factchecks/2022/mar/07/facebook-posts/press-conference-was-held-2020-orchestrated-russia/
