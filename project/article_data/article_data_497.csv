Does David Perdue want to eliminate the U.S. Education Department?
","A new ad from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee wants to paint GOP Senate hopeful David Perdue as an extremist when it comes to education. Education has already been a hot issue in the tight governor’s race. The ad, ""Help,"" sounds the alarm for the topic in the closely watched Senate battle between Perdue and Democrat Michelle Nunn. The main claim: Perdue wants to abolish the federal Department of Education, which would jeopardize $1 billion for Georgia public schools already struggling with tight budgets. ""That would devastate Georgia schools,"" the ad narrator says. ""A billion dollars cut from K through 12. Eliminate all federal student loans."" Republicans have called for eliminating the federal department since Ronald Reagan first pledged to do so in his 1980 presidential campaign. The issue has lived on in some conservative circles, even amid stiff Congressional opposition for decades. Reagan himself switched positions in 1983, after a federal report warned of a ""rising tide of mediocrity"" in American schools. The son of two teachers, Perdue has talked at length about the need for more local control. But does that translate into eliminating the federal department? And would the cut mean such a dramatic loss to school funding in Georgia? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out. First, we looked at Perdue’s stance.  When asked about Common Core in a July interview with the Marietta Daily Journal, Perdue called for the academic standards to be abandoned and ""went on to say the federal Department of Education should be abolished."" The July story does not include a direct quote. But a July story in the Covington News quotes Perdue as saying the department should be ""defunded"" and fixed. In October, the Political Insider blog referred to the MDJ story calling for the department to be abolished and quoted a campaign spokeswoman as saying Perdue’s plan called for shifting money from the federal to the local level. Perdue did not respond to repeated requests to clarify those comments. However, when asked by Channel 2 Action News to address the specific charge at a press conference at the National Federation of Independent Business on Oct. 2, he did not deny the claim. ""My position all along on this has been that big government is not producing results,"" Perdue said. ""So what I would look at doing is moving a lot of those dollars that go into the federal government back in the local school systems where the best decision can be made."" States handle nearly all education policy and issues. At the federal level, the Education Department conducts research, enforces federal anti-discrimination laws and, as the ad says, handles federal financial aid in loans and grants. But as the ad suggests, there is also plenty of money at hand. The ad says eliminating the department would cut $1 billion in K-12 funding every year and eliminate student loans. That’s a slightly conservative estimate, given that Georgia will receive nearly $1.1 billion in elementary and secondary school funding for the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, and another $1.1 billion for the current year, according to federal figures. There is even more money in the two federal loan programs set up by the Higher Education Act of 1965 – with Georgians receiving about $2.9 billion in federal direct student loans, records show. In addition, more than 297,000 Georgia students received federal Pell Grants in 2012-2013, totaling nearly $991million, according to federal numbers. The U.S. Education Department has administered all of those programs since 2010, when the government eliminated the Federal Family Education Loans program and began making loans directly to students and parents. That is to say, the loan programs’ operation has been shifted already. And Congress could again shift them to another agency if it voted to eliminate the federal education department. Reagan had called for such a transition years ago. Rick Hess, director of education policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, said he doesn’t believe the next Congress will have the majority votes needed to abolish the U.S. Department of Education or the funding it provides for student loans and other programs. Even with talk of abolishing the department in the past, discussions have called for those programs to move to the Department of Health and Human Services, he said. ""I don’t think you could find 15 votes for doing away with the funding,"" Hess said. Andrew J. Coulson, director of the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute’s Center for Educational Freedom, agreed that abolishing the agency is ""not equivalent to ending all the programs/funding streams that currently are gathered there."" Coulson said there were federal education programs before the cabinet-level education department was established under President Carter, and other agencies continue to run some programs. The Head Start pre-K program, for example, is still run by DHHS, he said. That brings us back to the ad, which claims David Perdue supports eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, a position that could cripple Georgia schools, students and loan recipients. Our research finds there is reason to believe Perdue does support abolishing the department and transferring funding to the local level. But it is alarmist to suggest the end of the department would be the end of all K-12 money. And suggestions that it would mean the end of student loan programs ignores the history that has already shuffled their administration. For that reason, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFCF200>],/factchecks/2014/oct/22/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/does-david-perdue-want-eliminate-us-education-depa/
"['New Hampshire', 'Bipartisanship', 'Scott Brown']","
Scott Brown says Jeanne Shaheen voted with the president 99 percent of the time
","It’s become a go-to line of Scott Brown’s campaign to win a New Hampshire seat in the U.S. Senate -- so much so that he repeated it several times during an hour-long debate on Oct. 21, the first televised face-off of the campaign. Shaheen, Brown said just seven minutes into the debate in Concord, ""has in fact voted with the president over 99 percent of the time. What does that mean to people in New Hampshire? It means she was the deciding vote for Obamacare. … She’s also voted to put in place policies where we have more and more gridlock by voting with her party over 99 percent of the time."" Brown has delivered variations of this claim so frequently over the past few months that anyone in New Hampshire who’s been plugged into an electronic device has surely heard it. It’s been a mainstay of Brown’s ads in a frenzied air war -- so far in the race for U.S. Senate, more than 10,000 ads have aired costing, more than $7 million. PolitiFact New Hampshire looked into a version of this claim last March, after the New Hampshire Republican Party released a web video titled ""99 Percent."" It claimed that Shaheen consistently supports the president and ""votes with Obama 99 percent of the time."" The ad was launched before Brown had officially declared himself a candidate in the race. Here, we’ll look at Brown’s claim that Shaheen has ""voted with the president 99 percent of the time.""  (Last year PolitiFact New Hampshire checked the claim that Shaheen was the deciding vote for Obamacare and ruled that Mostly False.) Brown’s charge carries some weight. Even though Obama won New Hampshire twice, a majority of residents (55 percent) now disapprove of his job performance, and his signature legislative accomplishment -- the Affordable Care Act, or ""Obamacare"" -- is opposed by 52 percent of the people in the state, according to findings from an Oct. 10, 2014 Granite State Poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Democrats across the country have faced similar critiques from Republicans; PolitiFact has frequently checked such claims and found them to have varying degrees of accuracy. Obama himself acknowledged the strategy during a speech at Northwestern University on Oct. 2, 2014. ""Now, I am not on the ballot this fall,"" Obama said. ""But make no mistake:  These policies are on the ballot -- every single one of them."" During the debate, Brown even quoted the president to drive home his point. Of course, most politicians fall in line with the president when their party controls the White House. Still, we decided it would still be useful to dig into Shaheen’s voting record to see whether Brown was correct. When we checked this claim previously, we asked the NHGOP for evidence. Executive director Matt Mowers pointed us toward Congressional Quarterly’s annual presidential position votes report. CQ, a news service that covers Capitol Hill, examines voting patterns for every member of Congress and sorts them in ways that allow for comparisons. One of those ways is an annual examination of presidential support -- the number of votes by each lawmaker on bills in which the sitting president has staked out a position. The 2013 CQ analysis shows that, when you look at the pool of votes in which Obama took a clear position, Shaheen’s vote matched the president’s stance 99 percent of the time. Still, there’s more to that number than meets the eye. In 2013, the Senate took 291 roll call votes. CQ registers Obama as having taken a clear stance on 108 of those votes --  about one third. WMUR political reporter James Pindell further analyzed the figures and found that 70 of those votes involved presidential nominations -- to positions that ranged from Secretary of State John Kerry to a variety of federal judgeships. The remaining 38 involved some type of public policy, including seven on immigration, four on gun policy, and five budget bills. The only time Shaheen voted against Obama in 2013 came on a bill involving an Internet sales tax, Pindell reported. We found similar figures across CQ reports since Shaheen took office, which coincided with Obama’s election to his first term. CQ put her voting with Obama at least 95 percent of the time each year. Overall, during the five years since Shaheen took office, Shaheen’s votes have aligned with the president’s position 98 percent of the time. That’s pretty close to the 99 percent figure, however, it’s important to note some limitations of judging Shaheen’s support for the president based solely on the CQ analysis. Shaheen communications director Shripal Shah noted that the senator had broken with Obama on some issues that do not come to a vote; these are not reflected in the CQ tally. For instance, Shah noted that Shaheen spoke out against a new round of military base closures, an idea the Obama administration advanced in budget proposals, and she opposed a proposal floated by the president to change Social Security benefits. There are also other ways to measure Shaheen’s voting tendencies. OpenCongress, a nonpartisan legislative tracking service, found that in 2013, Shaheen voted with the majority of Democrats 93.1 percent of the time. That’s less frequently than the average Democrat in the Senate, putting her on the bottom half of the list. Finally, in June 2013, Shaheen was featured as a ""Bipartisan Champion"" by the Bipartisan Policy Center for her work on energy efficiency legislation. ""It's disingenuous to draw conclusions about Sen. Shaheen's record by only looking at a small number of votes,"" Shah said. Our ruling Scott Brown said Shaheen votes with Obama 99 percent of the time. Brown has credible support for this claim -- in 2013, Shaheen took the same position as the president 99 percent of the time when Obama outlined a clear position, based on analysis by Congressional Quarterly. That wasn’t much different than earlier years in the Senate -- overall, her votes have aligned with Obama’s 98 percent of the time since she took office. Still, the CQ ratings address a fraction of all issues facing Congress. Obama only took a clear position in about one third of the Senate votes, and in some issues that didn’t come to a vote, Shaheen broke with the President. Still, Brown’s claim about Shaheen isn’t far off. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC0D680>],/factchecks/2014/oct/22/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-jeanne-shaheen-voted-president-99/

Rick Scott says he supported in-state tuition for Dreamers while Charlie Crist opposed it
","Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist argued about immigration reform during their third and final debate. Scott defended his record in the debate, arguing that he had helped out a certain group of illegal immigrants afford college -- ""dreamers."" ""Dreamers,"" named for the as-yet unpassed DREAM Act, are illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. After Congress failed to pass the bill, President Barack Obama in June 2012 announced a two-year moratorium on the deportation of some children who had been brought to United States illegally by their parents. ""Let’s look at what I did do that Charlie said was the wrong thing to do,"" Scott said. ""I said if you grow up in our state, you should get the same in-state tuition as your peers. Charlie said when the Legislature didn’t pass it before, that they did the right thing. So Charlie was against that, but we did the right thing, because whatever country you grew up in, if you live in Florida you ought to have the same right (to) in-state tuition as your peers."" However, Scott is omitting part of his own record -- and part of Crist’s record -- about ""dreamers"" and in-state tuition. In-state tuition battles In April 2014 when it appeared that the Legislature under Gov. Scott would approve in-state tuition for certain illegal immigrants, the Republican Party of Florida said in an email that ""In 2006, Charlie Crist opposed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants."" (That was back when Crist was a Republican; he’s now running as a Democrat to win back his old office.) As support for its claim, the state party's email cited a 2006 Miami Herald article about Crist, who was then serving as state attorney general. The Herald article said that ""Crist, like (his GOP rival for governor CFO Tom) Gallagher, said state lawmakers did the ‘right thing’ earlier this year when they rejected a bill allowing children of illegal immigrants to pay the same tuition rates as Florida residents. But Crist, also like Gallagher, said he supported a proposal to let illegal immigrants get drivers' licenses. It didn't pass two years ago, despite support from Gov. Jeb Bush."" That year, a proposal to give certain Florida residents who were illegal immigrants in-state tuition divided Republican legislators and drew opposition from then-Senate President Tom Lee. Ultimately, the proposal failed. (Bush had said he supported giving in-state tuition to those children if they’d lived in Florida at least two years, but he added that he felt it wasn’t the year to deal with it, so the controversial provision was removed from an education bill.) When we looked at this question previously, a spokeswoman for the Republican Party of Florida didn’t point to any additional statements by Crist as support for the claim. So we searched for other statements by Crist about giving in-state tuition to children of illegal immigrants. We found little else prior to his current campaign as a Democrat. We did not locate any bills to grant in-state tuition to ""dreamers"" that reached Crist’s desk during his tenure as governor 2007 and 2011. We did find an August 2006 article in the Tampa Bay Times that included a one-word ""yes"" or ""no"" answer from gubernatorial candidates to several questions, including: ""Should we allow the children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at our universities?"" The answer for Crist? ""No."" That provides support for Scott’s claim. However, both candidates have had a zigzagging approach to the issue, which complicates the neat story line Scott tried to communicate in the CNN debate. Scott omitted that during the 2014 campaign, Crist has supported in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. ""We must immediately pass legislation that allows the children of undocumented parents to attend Florida colleges and universities at in-state tuition levels,"" Crist wrote on the immigration page of his campaign website. ""It simply isn’t fair to punish children of undocumented parents."" At the same time, Scott omitted that he changed his opinion about the issue, earning him a Full Flop from PolitiFact Florida. In September 2011, Scott told the conservative website Newsmax that ""with regard to in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, I completely oppose it."" That changed by 2014 when, after a decade of failed attempts, it appeared that the Legislature might pass the bill.  In mid-April, Scott made his support clear. In a joint statement with former Republican Govs. Jeb Bush and Bob Martinez, Scott said, ""Students who have spent their childhood here in Florida deserve to qualify for the same in-state tuition rate at universities their peers and classmates do. We want our students to stay here in Florida when they go to college and when they choose a career, and that means we must make college more affordable for all those students who call Florida home. The Florida Senate should take immediate action to move S.B. 1400 forward."" Our ruling Scott said he supported in-state tuition for ""dreamers"" while Crist was against it. There’s some truth to that claim, but the reality is that both candidates have flip-flopped on the issue, manking such a clear-cut comparison problematic. In reality, Scott was against in-state tuition for ""dreamers"" in 2011 but came for it in 2014. Crist opposed it in 2006 but voiced his support during this current campaign. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFB2A80>],/factchecks/2014/oct/22/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-he-supported-state-tuition-dreamer/

Charlie Crist: Rick Scott rejected high-speed rail that would have created 60,000 jobs in Florida
","In an exchange during Florida’s final gubernatorial debate that was emblematic of the race, Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist cast accusations over who was to blame for the nasty campaign. Scott said his Democratic challenger was a divider and a mudslinger. Crist shot back that the Republican incumbent was unwilling to work with a Democratic president to the detriment of the state. His proof? Scott’s rejection of federal high-speed rail money in 2011. ""I reached across the aisle when I was your governor. I worked with the president to get the recovery funds. This governor, Gov. Rick Scott, won't work with the president, even to get high-speed rail, which is so important to central Florida and eventually the whole state. It would've been $2.4 billion to Florida, some say 60,000 jobs."" He later repeated the number saying the state was ""offered"" 60,000 jobs. Scott refused $2.4 billion in federal funds for a proposed Tampa-to-Orlando high-speed line when he first came into office in 2011, joining several other Republican governors in rejecting federal stimulus money and squashing President Barack Obama’s vision for a modernized light-rail network. But would the project have created 60,000 jobs? The Crist campaign didn’t get back to us, but it’s not the first time someone claimed the rail line would have created 60,000 jobs. The number stood out to us in February 2011 when Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Jacksonville, said it on the House floor because it was the largest estimate we had heard. It was, and still is, a misleading figure. By the Florida Department of Transportation’s own estimates, the project would have created 49,990 jobs — 23,600 direct jobs, like construction and design, and 26,300 indirect jobs, like those created for equipment suppliers. So right away, claiming this new high-speed rail would create 60,000 jobs is highballing the state’s estimate by about 10,000. But even the 50,000-job figure is fuzzy. Here’s why. The state transportation department calculated these jobs in something called ""job-years,"" which, in short, refers to the number of jobs that will be funded each year. The project would have taken place over a four-year period and in each year a different number of workers would have been needed to facilitate construction. Some people could work all four years, others might just be needed for a few months.   A report by the Central Florida Partnership, an Orlando-area economic development group, explained it more bluntly: Peak rail employment would occur between fall 2012-14 and require about 10,000 workers. That excludes indirect jobs. So at the height of construction, about 10,000 people would be needed. But those jobs would be temporary. After the rail line is up and running, FDOT said it will create 600 permanent jobs to operate the 84-mile line and 500 permanent spinoff jobs. The best way to look at the rail project is to say that it would have employed directly or indirectly 6,200 workers in 2011, 21,600 workers in 2012, 18,900 workers in 2013, 2,100 workers in 2014. About 1,100 permanent jobs would be needed after the rail was operational. That’s a far cry from 60,000 jobs. Our ruling Crist said ""some say 60,000 jobs"" would have been created by a Tampa-to-Orlando high-speed rail line. Some may say that, but they would be wrong. Even a cursory reading of the state’s estimates put the figure at about 50,000, significantly less than what Crist claimed. A detailed explanation shows a more nuanced forecast. Basically, the project pays for 50,000 one-year salaries over the course of four years. At the high-point, 21,600 workers would be needed in 2011, but just 2,100 in 2014. About 1,100 permanent jobs would be created thereafter. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC806F80>],/factchecks/2014/oct/22/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-rick-scott-rejected-high-speed-rail-/

 Five years on, chain email about cancer treatment rationing after age 76 is still Pants on Fire
","A reader recently sent us a years-old chain email that has morphed into something more timely. It now has the heading, ""IMPORTANT ACTION INFORMATION FOR NOVEMBER, 2014  VOTE."" For years before that, though, the chain email has floated around the Internet, making the scary claim that ""at age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment. Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age."" PolitiFact Oregon gave this a rating of Pants on Fire when they looked at it in 2013. The email -- which has changed somewhat as it has zigzagged around social media -- can be identified by its attribution of the information to Judge David Kithil of Marble Falls, Texas. (More on him later.) It opens with a dire warning: ""MEDICARE AT AGE 76, IMPORTANT PLEASE READ - ANYONE WHO DOUBTS THIS IS TRUE CAN DOWNLOAD THE NEW OBAMA CARE AND LOOK UP THE PAGES MENTIONED. THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING......THIS should be read by everyone, especially important to those over 75..... If you are younger, then it may apply to your parents…."" However, the email is hardly up-to-date -- it’s been circulating since 2009 and apparently stems from a list of tweets by blogger Peter Fleckenstein about H.R. 3200. That was an early version of the legislation that later became the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Many aspects of that original bill never made it into law, and other provisions have been misinterpreted or exaggerated by the email’s author. In fact, our friends at FactCheck.org found that just four of the email’s 48 claims were accurate. Here, we'll recap what we know about the cancer claim and a few of the email's other points. The cancer claim The email bases its claim about the age-based rationing of cancer care on page 272 of H.R. 3200, section 1145. But the claim is not correct. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law in March 2010. It does not include rationing for cancer treatment based on age or any other demographic factor. Nor did the precursor bill, H.R. 3200, include a cut-off age for cancer treatments. One provision of H.R. 3200 did include a section on ""treatment of certain cancer hospitals,"" but this simply allowed Medicare -- the federally run health plan for those older than 65 -- to allocate more funding to cancer hospitals if they incurred higher costs. The American Nurses Association called this the ""opposite of rationing.""  Under current legislation, ""all medically necessary treatment is covered by Medicare. Including cancer treatments, regardless of age,"" said Katherine Fitzpatrick of the Medicare Rights Center, an advocacy group, in a June 2013 interview. The Medicare Rights Center and AARP, the largest national organization of seniors, agree that hospital admittance has to do with billing under parts A or B of Medicare. Under the version of the Affordable Care Act that was adopted, Medicare payments to hospitals can be reduced if patients are readmitted within 30 days for certain conditions, such as pneumonia, but that’s not what the email claims. Meanwhile, the email raises a legitimate concern -- ""rationing"" -- but does so in a misleading way. ""Everyone hates the word ‘rationing,’ "" Harvard University health-policy specialist Katherine Baicker told PolitiFact in 2009. But rationing is not something that suddenly appeared in the Affordable Care Act, she added. ""From an economics perspective, there's no way around rationing. Some care is being rationed now. Everyone isn't getting everything."" It’s theoretically possible to spend an unlimited amount on health care, but as a society, we only have a limited amount of public resources -- so tough decisions have to be made on how to allocate those resources. Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, ""rationing"" occurred when private insurers denied coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, or denied reimbursement for certain basic services, or priced their plans too high for certain consumers to pay. If anything, John F. Holahan, a fellow at the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center, said in an earlier interview that private insurers are historically more likely to deny health services than Medicare is. ""That's the argument you hear people making,"" he said. ""But I think they have it backwards."" A final word. Remember Judge Kithil, the supposed author of the email? He’s disowned it. ""I wish it would die. I can’t control it,"" David Kithil told PolitiFact Oregon in 2013. ""I don’t know how something like that goes viral."" The former judge recalled that he wrote a letter to his local newspaper in 2009, protesting the initial version of the health care act. The letter was published in the River Cities Daily Tribune, circulation 5,000. Somehow, he said, it was republished online. Kithil said he wants readers to disregard his letter, since it is outdated and based on legislation that did not become law. ""I’ve had calls from all over the country -- 300 to 400 calls over three or four years on this,"" he said at the time. He said he pleads with the callers, ""Don’t pass it on. It’s not accurate anymore. Trash it."" Our ruling The chain email says that the Affordable Care Act requires that, ""at age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment. … Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age."" With this email, longevity has not meant accuracy: Seniors do not need to worry about their cancer care being yanked away once they reach age 76. The claims are based on an incorrect understanding of a bill that never passed. The Affordable Care Act does not include any sections on seniors losing their treatment eligibility once they reach age 76. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE5E0C0>],/factchecks/2014/oct/21/chain-email/five-years-chain-email-about-cancer-treatment-rati/

Rick Scott: Fla. electric rates are lower since Charlie Crist left office and below national average
","After the brouhaha in last week’s Florida gubernatorial debate over electronic fans, there was a heated exchange between Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist on electric rates. Crist, who won the governorship as a Republican in 2006 and is now running as a Democrat, said the Sunshine State needs new investments in solar energy, and the next governor must stand up to the ""utility companies that keep jacking up your bills."" Scott, the Republican incumbent, shot back that Crist was playing fast and loose with the facts. ""While he was governor, utility costs went up 30 percent and went from below the national average to above the national average,"" Scott said. ""Since I got elected, utility rates have come down 11 percent and now we are below the average."" There’s two parts to this fact-check: Under which administration were electric bills higher, and how does that compare to the national average? It’s clear from the conversation and the evidence we received from the Scott campaign that he was talking about residential rates. So that’s what we’ll focus on. Understanding electric rates When you get your electric bill, there’s a good chance you only catch the amount telling you what you owe. But that number is made up of two components: the base rate and cost-recovery clauses. The cost-recovery clause is sometimes called the pass-through clause, because costs incurred by a power company are passed through to customers. The base rate, on the other hand, is essentially how companies get a return on their investment. The largest cost-recovery clause is fuel. Power companies charge consumers for the cost of purchasing the coal, natural gas or other energy sources needed to make their plants go. Just like gas prices at the pump change every time you fill up, fuel prices for power companies can be quite volatile. Fuel prices are also, for the most part, out of the control of any governor. Whether power companies can get cheap natural gas is most often a national issue, not a state issue. With that in mind, let’s look at the data. Who saw higher rates? PolitiFact Florida obtained data on electric rates for the four large investor-owned power companies operating in Florida — Florida Power & Light Co., Duke Energy, Tampa Electric Company and Gulf Power Company — through an open records request with the state Public Service Commission. The information contained the overall rate as well as the base rate and various cost-recovery clauses. For Florida Power & Light, Duke Energy and Tampa Electric, electric rates in the last eight years peaked during the Crist administration. For those three utilities, the high point came in 2009. But in all three cases, the spike was not caused by an increase in base rates. Indeed, base rates were relatively stable across the board during Crist’s tenure. Instead, the higher electric rates were caused by large increases in fuel recovery costs. Take Tampa Electric Company, for example. The base rate in 2009 was the same as it was the day Crist took office: $51.92 per 1,000 kilowatt hours. But customers were paying $128 per 1,000 kilowatt hours in 2009 compared to $114 in 2007. What changed? The cost of fuel jumped $10 per 1,000 kilowatt hours. This was caused by a steep increase in natural gas prices nationwide, said J.R. Kelly, the public counsel for Florida who represents the people of the state in utility-related matters. ""That’s nobody's fault or the result of any change by any governor or the Legislature,"" Kelly said. ""No matter who was governor, natural gas prices tripled in costs so all the fuel charges went soaring."" A couple of years later, there was a natural gas boom in the United States, and prices dropped considerably. Power companies also credit their own moves to build more efficient plants. What happened to electric rates? They fell as well. You can see this all play out in this chart.  Source: Florida Public Service Commission What’s notable is that fuel prices for utility companies continued to fall, but the overall electric rate did not drop at the same speed. That’s because the base rate went up as well. Rate changes are approved by the Public Service Commission, a five-member panel made up of gubernatorial appointees. All five current members were appointed by Scott from a list of names pre-approved by a legislative panel. Those five members were also appointed by Crist, though four of his initial choices were rejected by the Republican-controlled Legislature. Base rate increases occurred under both administrations but are considerably higher under Scott.

This despite the fact that fuel reimbursements have fallen considerably since 2011. Florida vs. the national average  Scott’s campaign told us he got the numbers from a study on residential electric rates by the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for investor-owned power companies. According to Scott’s campaign, ""the average residential electric bill in Florida (for investor-owned utilities) went from 9.66 cents per kilowatt hour in 2006 to 12.41 cents per kilowatt hour in 2010."" First, Scott’s numbers are significantly off, based on the studies provided to us by Edison Electric Institute. We quickly found his mistakes. The average residential bill was 9.66 cents per kilowatt hour in 2005, when Jeb Bush was governor. The average monthly rate was 11.61 cents per kilowatt hour in 2006, when Crist was running for governor and 11.43 cents during his first year in office. The average monthly rate also wasn’t 12.41 cents per kilowatt hour in 2010. That was the rate in 2009. As we noted earlier, that was around the time fuel prices spiked. During Crist’s last year in office, the rate was actually 11.18 cents per kilowatt hour, which would mean the average monthly bill actually went down during Crist’s tenure. There also hasn’t been an 11 percent decrease under Scott. Again, that’s based off an incorrect number for 2010. In 2013, the last year of data available, the average monthly rate was 11.06 per kilowatt hour. The study also does not show that rates were higher in Florida than the national average when Crist left office. When Crist came in, Florida’s average monthly bill in 2006 and 2007 was above the rest of the country. But the national average during his final year in office was 12.01 cents per kilowatt hour, higher than Florida’s monthly average of 11.18. In that measure, Florida has stayed below the national average since. Much of this is backed up by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a clearinghouse for national energy statistics, which includes monthly breakdowns for more accurate timelines. When Crist entered office in January 2007, the average retail price of electricity for a Florida home was 11.06 cents per kilowatt hour. When Crist left office in January 2011, the rate was 11.33 cents per kilowatt hour. So it’s up, but hardly by 30 percent. The increase is actually about 2.5 percent. Also, by the time Crist was sworn in, Florida was already above the national average in residential utility rates by a full penny per kilowatt hour. In fact, the state had been above the rest of the country consistently since October 2005. While there were points that Florida’s residents paid less than the national average during Crist’s term, Florida rates were higher than the rest of the country when Crist finished his four-year term, though by considerably less than when he came in. What about during Scott’s tenure? The latest figures from June 2014 show Floridians on average pay 11.96 cents per kilowatt hour. That’s up 0.63 cents since Scott took office, or 5.6 percent, a larger jump than during Crist’s term in office. The cost of electricity in the rest of the country has increased at a higher rate than Florida, so Scott is right that Florida is now below the national average, but it’s not because rates have decreased under his watch, as he claimed. Our ruling Scott said that while Crist was governor, ""utility costs went up 30 percent and went from below the national average to above the national average. Since I got elected, utility rates have come down 11 percent and now we are below the average."" Scott is off in a lot of ways. First, his statistics don’t parse out the base rate from the rest of an electric bill, which is critical to understanding how bills go up. Doing so shows base rates for the four large investor-owned power companies have consistently gone up under Scott’s watch. Perhaps more egregiously, Scott’s campaign fumbled the data in a report to make it seem like rates were much lower when Crist took office and higher when he left. We found the right numbers, and it paints a completely different picture. On comparing the state to the rest of the country, data shows Florida’s rates were higher than the national average well before Crist took office, but the gap narrowed during his time in office. Florida is now below the national average, but it’s not because prices dropped under Scott. By several measures overall rates are actually higher now than they were when he took office, despite a decrease in fuel costs. There’s so much incorrect in Scott’s statement. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB103F80>],/factchecks/2014/oct/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-florida-electric-rates-are-lower-c/
"['Pop Culture', 'Pundits', 'PunditFact', ""Bill O'Reilly""]","
Bill O'Reilly says David Letterman's 'Late Show' ratings shoot up when he's a guest
","You probably wouldn’t describe Bill O’Reilly as humble. The Fox News personality is currently on a publicity tour for his new book Killing Patton, the fourth installment in the Fox host’s nonfiction Killing series. Speaking on Fox News’ Media Buzz, O’Reilly crowed about his ability to draw large television audiences. Kurtz asked O’Reilly if he was ready to stop referring to himself as a ""lonely outsider"" since he’s appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman and chatting with mainstream news hosts like Katie Couric of Yahoo! News and ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. Is he one of them now? ""It’s not a matter of being accepted, it’s about success,"" O’Reilly explained. ""And I bring ratings to those shows. So when I go on Letterman or I go on the morning shows, their ratings go up. That's why they have me on."" Because we were curious, we wondered about O’Reilly’s rating power when he appears on other shows. We focused on Letterman’s Late Show to make the exercise more manageable. We found 15 O’Reilly Late Show appearances since 2001 using the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) and searching transcripts. We then pulled data for the number of estimated viewers for those shows from Nielsen Media Research, a company that tracks consumers patterns and TV viewership. We measured the number of viewers who watched O’Reilly’s appearances against the average of viewers who watched the same day of the week that season, as well as against the Late Show’s annual calendar average. A couple of quirks about the data: CBS provided Nielsen data for average weekday viewers in terms of broadcast years, which run from September to September and include repeat shows. Nielsen provided average viewers for the calendar year, excluding specials and repeats. The show is on five nights a week, including repeats, so we don’t think it’s a huge matter. Also, some ratings for 2014 are not available because Nielsen is still re-evaluating its data following a reporting error for broadcast networks from the last seven months. In the chart below, we shaded appearances in which O’Reilly’s ratings outnumbered either the weekday average for the season or the annual average. As you’ll see, O’Reilly is largely correct: He usually beats the seasonal weekday average of viewers as well as the calendar year average. Date of O’Reilly on Late Show Day of the week O’Reilly viewers Season Weekday average for season Annual average of viewers  Feb. 23, 2001 Friday 4.80 million 2000-01 4.26 million 4.27 million Oct. 5, 2004 Tuesday 3.51 million 2004-05 3.85 million 4.45 million Jan. 3, 2006 Tuesday 4.39 million 2005-06 3.63 million 4.16 million Oct. 27, 2006 Friday 4.79 million 2006-07 3.83 million 4.16 million Oct. 27, 2008 Monday 3.77 million 2008-09 3.79 million 3.63 million March 31, 2009 Tuesday 4.06 million 2008-09 3.66 million 3.80 million Dec. 9, 2010 Wednesday 4.08 million 2010-11 3.29 million 3.55 million Oct. 13, 2011 Thursday 3.43 million 2011-12 3.06 million 3.34 million May 23, 2012 Wednesday 2.82 million 2011-12 3.03 million 2.95 million Oct. 24, 2012 Wednesday 3.48 million 2012-13 2.98 million 2.95 million Feb. 11, 2013 Monday 3.07 million 2012-13 2.82 million 2.90 million June 17, 2013 Monday 2.62 million 2012-13 2.82 million 2.90 million Oct. 16, 2013 Wednesday 3.28 million 2013-14 2.76 million 2.90 million March 14, 2014 Friday n/a 2013-14 2.83 million n/a Oct. 1, 2014 Wednesday 2.69 million 2014-15 2.57 million n/a Of 14 appearances with data since 2001, Late Show episodes featuring O’Reilly outperformed the average number of viewers by both measures 10 times. An 11th appearance, on Oct. 27, 2008, drew about 140,000 more viewers than the calendar year average but about 20,000 fewer than the Monday average during the 2008-09 season. Put another way, the shows in which O’Reilly touted a recent book or offered political commentary exceeded the show’s weekday and calendar year average 70 percent of the time. CBS would not comment on whether it invites O’Reilly to boost ratings. Our ruling In a trademark moment of non-modesty, O’Reilly bragged about his effect as a guest star on mainstream broadcast shows. ""I bring ratings to those shows. So when I go on Letterman or I go on the morning shows, their ratings go up,"" he said. Looking strictly at Letterman’s Late Show, to keep things simple, we found he has a point. Using available data, we found O’Reilly beat the average ratings for the comparable day of the week and calendar year 10 or 11 times out of 14 show appearances with data. In this specific case, booking O’Reilly isn’t a sure bet for better ratings. But it’s a pretty safe one. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC879980>],/factchecks/2014/oct/21/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-says-lettermans-ratings-increase-when/

Rep. Tim Murphy says air ban on Israel offers precedent for Ebola travel policy
","Ebola was once again Topic A on the Sunday news shows. On Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace had an exchange with Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., over one of the most contentious Ebola-related issues -- whether to enact a travel ban from countries where Ebola is spreading, such as the west African nations of Liberia and Sierra Leone. Here’s the exchange: Wallace: ""I want to talk about the threats from those countries -- the ‘hot zone’ -- to this country, because one of the big issues, of course, is this idea of a travel ban. … Congressman Murphy, this is what President Obama said this week:"" Obama: ""Trying to seal off an entire region of the world, if that were even possible, could actually make the situation worse."" Wallace: ""Congressman Murphy, why is the president wrong?"" Murphy: ""Well, look, first of all, the president has sealed off Israel in the past, and we sealed off other areas temporarily. We can have travel restrictions until we get the rest right. And the rest is not right."" For this fact-check, we’ll focus on whether blocking travel from countries with Ebola should be because Obama ""has sealed off Israel in the past."" We didn’t hear back from Murphy’s office, but the only example involving Israel that experts could recall was the two-day ban earlier this year on American airlines flying into or out of Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport. The Israel flight ban became a cause celebre earlier for conservatives such as Ted Cruz, and the comparison of the Israel ban and a possible Ebola flight ban has been the subject of comment on some conservative blogs. That ban was in effect for parts of July 22 and July 23, in the middle of a weeks-long battle between Israel and Hamas. The Federal Aviation Administration ban was enacted after a Hamas rocket landed within a mile of the airport, prompting safety concerns for airliners flying into and out of the airport, according to news reports. (This was less than a week after a Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 was shot down while flying over a war zone in eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014.) As the official FAA notification about the ban put it, ""At 12:15 EDT on July 22, 2014, the FAA issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) informing U.S. airlines that they are prohibited from flying to or from Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport for a period of up to 24 hours."" The notification went on to clarify that the move ""applies only to U.S. operators, and has no authority over foreign airlines operating to or from the airport."" This is an important distinction. The FAA’s decision prevented U.S. carriers from flying into or out of Ben Gurion Airport -- but it did not prevent foreign-owned carriers from flying into or out of Ben Gurion, including those headed to the United States, carrying Americans or people of any other nationality. Indeed, some supporters of Israel, such as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, made a show of solidarity with Israel by flying to Ben Gurion despite the ban, using foreign carriers such as Israel’s El Al. On July 23, Bloomberg tweeted, ""Safely landed at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv - here to show support for Israel's right to defend itself."" In other words, the Israel example was hardly a case of a country being ""sealed off."" The FAA did not act to stop airliners carrying Americans and foreigners flying from Israel to the United States -- only U.S. airplanes. ""U.S. citizens could still travel on international air carriers into and out of Israel during this time,"" said Jeffrey C. Price, a professor of aviation and aerospace science at the Metropolitan State University of Denver. This situation isn’t comparable to what would be needed to stop air traffic from west African nations currently grappling with Ebola. To truly keep out Ebola-infected patients from west Africa, the government would need to ban all flights originating in west Africa from landing in the United States. That’s a more all-encompassing ban than the one imposed on Israel. If the FAA simply followed the Israeli example, foreign carriers could continue to fly passengers unimpeded into the United States, something that would defeat the purpose of an Ebola-related ban. (It’s not even clear what a U.S. flight ban might look like. According to CNN, there are no direct flights to the United States from either Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea, the three countries most heavily affected by Ebola today.) ""It’s wrong to compare what happened in Israel with what has been discussed regarding Ebola and Africa,"" said Henry H. Harteveldt, founder and travel industry analyst with the Atmosphere Research Group. Separately, the United States could enforce a ban against anyone infected with Ebola. The only notable precedent for that was a ban that lasted for more than 20 years that kept travelers with H.I.V. -- the virus that causes AIDS -- from entering the country. (This ban was ended in 2009 under Obama.) However, if that’s the kind of ban Murphy was referring to, then his on-air comparison is off-base. The AIDS ban never specifically targeted any one country, and it was implemented by President Ronald Reagan, not Obama. Our ruling Murphy said that blocking travel from countries with Ebola should be feasible because Obama ""has sealed off Israel in the past."" However, the two-day air-travel ban imposed by the FAA earlier this year affected U.S.-owned carriers without halting travel into and out of Israel by foreign-owned carriers, who may have been carrying either Americans or foreigners, and who may have been flying unimpeded into U.S. airports. Comparing this to a travel ban designed to stop Ebola from leaving west Africa is a case of apples and oranges. The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC879280>],/factchecks/2014/oct/21/tim-murphy/rep-tim-murphy-says-air-ban-israel-offers-preceden/

Austin mayoral hopeful Sheryl Cole says this year, ""we"" granted homestead exemptions to Austinites
","Mayoral candidate Sheryl Cole said at the mid-October  ""Ballot Boxing"" candidate forum that city leaders have acted to soften the bite of property taxes for homeowners. Cole, an Austin City Council member and the mayor pro tem, responded to a reporter's question about what each hopeful would do to change how much residents affected by rising property values pay in property taxes. After saying the Austin school district levies Travis County’s highest property tax rate and also noting her interest in fighting ""disportionate"" appraisals of commercial and residential properties, Cole said: ""This year, we also granted a small homestead exemption of $5,000, which was a flat amount and it wasn’t on a percentage basis, so it applied equally to everyone. And,"" Cole said, ""we also granted an exemption for the elderly and the disabled members of the community. I think it’s important that we continue to address this,"" she closed. There’d already been talk of property tax exemptions, which reduce the taxable value of a home, in advance of the November elections giving voters a chance to choose a new Austin mayor and fill 10 council seat being fielded for the first time from single-member districts. In August 2014, mayoral candidate Steve Adler called for an across-the-board 20 percent homestead exemption, cutting a typical homeowner’s city tax bill by $189. About three weeks later, an Austin American-Statesman news story described Cole and another mayoral aspirant, Council Member Mike Martinez, as supporters of a proposal by Council Member Kathie Tovo to create a $5,000 homestead exemption, reducing the city tax bill of a median-valued home by $24. So, is Cole right about the council granting the described exemptions? A council resolution According to the Statesman news story posted online Aug. 26, 2014, Tovo’s proposed $5,000 exemption would apply to about 130,000 owner-occupied homes. Later the same week, the council approved a resolution, which we read on the city’s website, directing the city manager to return to the council no later than Dec. 1, 2014, with a percentage-based proposal resulting in a $5,000 a year exemption for each residential homeowner. The resolution noted, too, that under state law, if a city grants such an exemption, it must be for at least $5,000. The resolution also said the exemption would cost the city $3.1 million a year in forgone revenue. A city spokeswoman, Melissa Alvarado, told us by email city staff are preparing the ordinance to bring before the council for approval. Asked if the exemption could possibly apply to property taxes due for 2014, Alvarado indicated not, noting that state law requires such an exemption to be adopted by a governing body before July of the first affected tax year. Alvarado said: ""The $5,000 exemption, if adopted, would first affect property tax bills associated with FY 2015-16 (i.e. property tax bills due in January of 2016)."" Expanded exemption The council acted earlier in 2014 to increase an exemption benefiting elderly and disabled homeowners. On March 20, 2014, according to an American-Statesman news story, the council by 5-2 voted to raise the property tax exemption for homeowners older than 65 or disabled, from $51,000 to $70,000 -- saving the typical elderly homeowner about $100 a year starting with the 2014 tax year. The city’s tax exemption for senior or disabled homeowners was established, at $3,000, in 1974, the story said, and had been last increased, to $51,000, in 1986. About 34,000 properties in Austin receive the tax break, the story said, causing the city to miss out on about $8 million in annual revenue. Cole's campaign To our queries, Cole’s campaign manager, Kevin Opp, emailed that Cole should have said the elderly/disabled exemption had been expanded rather than granted. But Opp maintained the August resolution calling for city officials to draft an ordinance for the $5,000 exemption was tantamount to adopting the exemption. Cole ""took action on the Council this year, and it will go into effect at the earliest possible date for the next property tax bill,"" Opp wrote. Our ruling Cole, speaking of the Austin City Council, said this year, ""we granted a small homestead exemption of $5,000... applied equally to everyone. And we also granted an exemption for the elderly and the disabled members of the community."" Both parts of this claim are stretches. That is, a $5,000 homestead exemption might be adopted by the council later this year or in 2015, but it hasn’t been granted or applied to anyone already. And while the council in 2014 increased the homestead exemption for the elderly and disabled, that benefit originated in the 1970s. We rate this statement Mostly False.

"['Georgia', 'Michelle Nunn']","
Outsourcing doesn't always mean lost jobs
","The neck-and-neck battle for Georgia’s open U.S. Senate seat appears to have found its flash point: outsourcing. The race had already focused heavily on the careers of Democrat Michelle Nunn and Republican David Perdue, given both are political novices. But Nunn, the head of the nonprofit Points of Light Foundation, has increased the drumbeat against former Fortune 500 executive Perdue since a 2005 deposition surfaced with him saying he ""spent most of my career"" outsourcing. In the business world, the term refers generally to the process of contracting out jobs or work abroad that had been done, or could be done, in-house. For workers just easing out of the Great Recession, outsourcing represents a threat to job security and job growth. Democrats, aware of that perceived threat by voters, have worked since summer to paint Perdue’s business record as one that benefited him and not his employees. But the deposition has given Nunn new ammunition, prompting updated claims in ads and in the Oct. 7 debate at the Georgia National Fair. ""He would be the only senator who, from his own words, has built a career from outsourcing American jobs,"" Nunn said. ""That is not the experience we need in Washington."" Given the reload, PolitiFact decided to see whether the deposition moves the needle on a previous Truth-O-Meter ruling that it was Half True that Perdue’s business record focused on shipping American jobs overseas. First up, a primer on the deposition. It was taken as part of a lawsuit following the bankruptcy of Pillowtex, a North Carolina firm that failed shortly after Perdue’s brief stint as its CEO. A claim during the GOP runoff election that Perdue was to blame for the firm’s collapse earned a Mostly False ruling this summer, largely given the company’s financial woes that predated his tenure. Perdue, however, did tell PolitiFact Georgia that before the extent of Pillowtex’s money troubles was revealed, his turnaround plan for the company was a mix of outsourcing and marketing. It called for lower-end products to be made in Asia, while brand-name items would be American-made. Perdue said the same thing in the deposition. But those statements, and the company’s business records, reveal outsourcing plans at Pillowtex were not an effort to eliminate American jobs, said Rob Bliss, a professor of finance at Wake Forest University. The plan – which was never implemented – was instead designed to save at least some domestic jobs in an industry that had largely moved overseas, Bliss said. ""There is nothing to suggest he was narrowly moving jobs overseas just to increase profits or give himself a bonus,"" Bliss said. ""Moving jobs overseas would have been an effort to make the company more competitive. It’s a perfectly legitimate thing to do."" In Pillowtex’s case, there was only a failed plan to move jobs. PolitiFact Georgia did find evidence that American jobs were lost in other firms Perdue helped manage or lead. Sara Lee eliminated between 8,000 and 9,000 jobs worldwide – mostly in the United States and Europe – in a 1994 restructuring. At the time, Perdue was the senior vice president for the company’s operations in Asia. He confirms in the deposition that he successfully increased manufacturing and contracts in the region as part of that job. At the same time, the company was closing four plants in Georgia, eliminating at least 540 jobs. Nunn’s earlier claim using those facts was ruled True. The deposition also refers to Perdue’s time as a senior VP with the Haggar Clothing Co. between 1996 and 1998. Perdue does not mention details of his time there, though PolitiFact research showed 1,950 American jobs were lost at Haggar during that period.   Business records show the firm also shed 65 foreign jobs in those two years, indicating an overall business decline in addition to any move to foreign production. ""He was part of a bad scene in American industry,"" said Kerwin Swint, the chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. ""But trying to say he doesn’t care about American workers, that’s a leap."" Taken together, Perdue’s own words in the legal interrogation only reveal what was already known about his business career. He managed and led companies in industries where jobs were being lost to both cheaper foreign production – outsourcing – and also to technology and global business trends far outside his scope of control. Moreover, the deposition was taken two years before Perdue, as CEO of Dollar General, persuaded the discount chain to sell to a private equity firm. At the time, he had grown the chain from 5,900 to 8,500 stores, adding about 19,000 part-time and full-time jobs. ""Politically, it’s a good strategy to focus on the outsourcing, but that doesn’t mean it’s accurate and fair,"" Swint said. ""There is more to it."" We agree. It is accurate to claim Perdue’s sworn statement is that he spent most of his business career outsourcing. But that doesn’t translate into callous indifference to American workers – or even a tenure that did nothing more than ship jobs abroad. We continue to rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7F0080>],/factchecks/2014/oct/21/michelle-nunn/outsourcing-doesnt-always-mean-moving-jobs/

Rick Scott says bill he vetoed to give driver licenses to DACA immigrants changed 'nothing'
","Gov. Rick Scott and Charlie Crist are competing for the Hispanic vote, leading the candidates to argue about their stances on everything from the Cuba embargo to rights for illegal immigrants. During the Telemundo debate Oct. 10, the debate moderator asked the candidates to explain their conflicting views on driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children. In 2013, the Legislature passed a bill to give driver licenses to those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, sometimes called ""Dreamers."" Scott vetoed it. Crist, a Democrat, said during the debate: ""I’m in favor of a driver’s license for Dreamers. The governor recently signed a bill where they can have in-state tuition. And that was a good thing to do. But if you can’t drive to school, or you can’t drive to your job, good luck getting to work."" Scott, a Republican, responded: ""The driver’s license bill that was passed, nothing changed. Those same individuals have the right to get a Florida driver’s license today."" Scott was partially correct and partially misleading. Floridians who get Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, called DACA, generally get work permits, which they can use to get driver’s licenses. But he is overstating the situation when he says ""nothing changed,"" because that bill would have affirmatively given those immigrants the right to use their DACA forms to get a driver’s license, even if their work permit didn’t arrive simultaneously. Scott vetoed the driver license bill In 2012, Obama announced DACA, which allows illegal immigrants who came to the country as children to apply for a renewable, temporary status that suspends deportation, as long as they can prove they are law abiding and meet other requirements. As of the end of June 2014, about 580,000 individuals nationwide received initial deferred action including 23,196 in Florida. In 2013, Florida lawmakers proposed HB 235. The proposal would allow Dreamers to use their new federal status as a way to obtain a temporary driver license. A Florida House analysis said that without the law, Dreamers would first have to receive an employment authorization card before they could receive a temporary driver license. In April 2013, the Florida bill sailed through unanimously in the Senate and with only two ""no"" votes in the House. Scott vetoed the bill June 4, 2013. In his veto message, Scott bashed the Obama administration for implementing DACA and then argued that the bill was unnecessary: ""Already, Florida law allows those with a federal employment authorization card, without regard to their deferred action status, to obtain a temporary Florida driver license. Although the Legislature may have been well intentioned in seeking to expedite the process to obtain a temporary driver license, it should not have been done by relying on a federal government policy adopted without legal basis."" PolitiFact Florida asked spokespersons for Scott’s office and campaign to explain his evidence that the bill would not have changed anything and if that was the case why he bothered vetoing it. The only response we received was a copy of Scott’s veto. Democrats and immigrant rights’ groups criticized Scott’s veto and characterized it as a blow to Hispanics. But some news reports characterized Scott’s driver license veto as largely symbolic since immigrants could still get a driver license with the federal work permit. The ACLU of Florida, which criticized Scott’s veto, sent a letter to the state Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles stating ""the veto should have no impact on DHSMV’s current practice of granting driver’s licenses to current DACA recipients who have employment authorization.""   Federal immigration officials told PolitiFact Florida that people apply for DACA and the work permit at the same time and nearly everyone gets both. United States Citizenship and Immigration Service approved 591,555 requests for DACA between Aug. 15, 2012 and July 31, 2014. During the same period, the agency denied 635 applications for work permits. Potential reasons include failing to sign the forms or provide property documentation. Most of the immigration law experts we interviewed said that generally applicants get DACA and work permits at the same time, though some had heard anecdotes about people who got their DACA days, weeks or months before the work permit. Since such a delay could occur, the Legislature wanted to give these immigrants the right to use DACA to get their driver’s licenses as quickly as possible. ""It was basically to give those folks an opportunity to get their driver’s license right away,"" bill sponsor state Rep. Randolph Bracy, D-Orlando, told PolitiFact Florida. ""Sometimes they get their approval letter and work permit at the same time but sometimes they don’t. It was just a show of support toward the Dreamers and said ‘we are behind you.’ "" Our ruling Scott said that ""nothing changed"" for certain illegal immigrants to get driver licenses in a bill he vetoed. There was a change in the bill: It would have affirmatively stated that immigrants with DACA approval could use that documentation to get driver’s licenses. Scott vetoed the bill, so immigrants don’t have that right. However, applicants for DACA simultaneously apply for a work permit and generally get their approvals around the same time. If Scott hadn’t vetoed the bill, it would have meant that those who get DACA first wouldn’t have to wait for their work permit, although it is sometimes a short wait. The claim is partially accurate in that immigrants who get DACA will likely get a work permit and they can use that work permit to get the driver’s license. However, Scott exaggerated when he said ""nothing changed"" in the bill he vetoed. We rate this claim Half True. Editor's note: This report initially appeared with conflicted rulings.

Do 95 percent of Oregonians now have health insurance coverage? PolitiFact Oregon
","The rollout of Cover Oregon -- the state’s health insurance marketplace -- could hardly have been messier. Cost overruns, a famously dysfunctional website and, now, litigation, left the entire effort somewhere between comedy and tragedy. But that didn’t stop Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber, during a recent televised debate with Republican challenger Rep. Dennis Richardson, from claiming that health care in Oregon has never been more successful in terms of the number of people covered. The claim: Kitzhaber said the state will have an operating website for new insurance sign-ups within weeks. He added: ""Ninety-five percent of Oregonians now have health insurance coverage, tens of thousands of them for the very first time."" Do that many Oregonians now have health insurance? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: We contacted Kitzhaber’s campaign and received an email back from spokeswoman Amy Wojcicki. She provided links to three news stories, all on the release in September of a report produced by Oregon Health & Science University. All three cited the report’s finding that ""an estimated"" 95 percent of Oregon residents now have health coverage (up from 86 percent one year ago). Wanting to check the original source, we contacted the report’s author, OHSU health economist Peter Graven. He explained that the insurance numbers in the report came directly from state enrollment reporting. ""Oregon is one of only a few states that collect health insurance enrollment information from its insurers,"" according to the report. ""These data sources make it possible to implement this approach with a greater degree of confidence than would otherwise be possible."" The biggest driver in reducing the number of uninsured people in Oregon, he said, was the large expansion of Medicaid that was key to President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. That expansion, all paid for by the federal government, saw participation in the Oregon Health Plan increase by more than 360,000 individuals, or 59 percent, Graven said. The state, though, deserves credit for both reaching out to eligible populations and obtaining a waiver from the federal government to use a ""fast track"" process to automatically enroll eligible individuals and families, he said. ""Oregon pursued those options very aggressively,"" Graven said. ""Other states didn’t do that."" Cover Oregon, forced to sign people up manually, made a far smaller dent in the number of uninsured, he said. Using an extended open enrollment period and relying on insurance agents and community partners, Cover Oregon allowed nearly 80,000 people to find insurance through the marketplace. Of those, about 80 percent received tax credits based on their incomes. The estimated 550,000 Oregon residents who had no health insurance in June 2013 dropped to 201,794 one year later, Graven said. The number who gained insurance was offset somewhat by people who lost insurance offered through small- and large-group plans, Graven said. In some of those instances, employers eliminated company-offered health care, leaving people to seek other insurance options on their own. Of the 3.9 million residents living in the state in June 2013, 14 percent had no health insurance, he said. That number dropped by June 2014. ""We’ve never seen a nine-point drop in the overall population of uninsured,"" Graven said. ""We used to get really excited about two-point drops. This blows that out of the water."" The ruling: Kitzhaber, trying in a debate to put the Cover Oregon debacle in the best light, claimed that 95 percent of Oregon residents have health insurance coverage, many for the first time. The author of the report that produced the number said its accuracy is bolstered by regulations that make Oregon one of a few states allowed to collect comprehensive health insurance enrollment information directly from insurers. None of those insurers has questioned the validity of the report’s numbers, including the 95 percent figure. The claim is healthy enough to be rated True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7321C0>],/factchecks/2014/oct/20/john-kitzhaber/do-95-percent-oregonians-now-have-health-insurance/

Amid Ebola cases, Cory Gardner blasts CDC spending on 'jazzercise,' 'urban gardens'
","As fears over Ebola reached a crescendo, Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., took a shot at the federal government’s handling of the disease during a debate with Democratic Sen. Mark Udall. Gardner has been gaining ground in the closely watched Colorado Senate race, and that contest is just one of many around the country in which Ebola has become an issue. Gardner, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said, ""Perhaps the CDC should quit spending money on things like jazzercise, urban gardening and massage therapy and direct that money to where it's appropriate in protecting the health of the American people."" We wondered if it was true that the government is spending money on jazzercise, urban gardening and the like at the expense of funding for Ebola. We thought this claim deserved a closer look, so we’ll break it down into a few parts. Is the CDC spending money on jazzercise, urban gardening and massage therapy? We couldn’t nail that down for sure, but it’s plausible. We asked both Gardner’s staff and the CDC for documentation of this claim, but neither got back to us with evidence either way. However, we found an unsigned column from the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page -- a leading source of conservative commentary -- that makes that claim. Here’s an excerpt from that editorial, published on Oct. 9, 2014, which focuses on the Prevention and Public Health Fund, or PPHF: ""The PPHF automatically hands the Health and Human Services bureaucracy $15 billion this decade and after that $2 billion a year, with no earmarks, in perpetuity. HHS (of which the CDC is a part) can dip into this honey pot for whatever it pleases. ""In 2013 HHS raided the PPHF of $453.8 million, or 48 percent of that year’s appropriation, to fund the Obamacare insurance exchanges. Those PPHF dollars that have flowed to public health are an insult to this once august field. The PPHF sponsors liberal pressure groups to lobby states and cities for higher tobacco taxes and zoning laws that restrict fast food, and its other urgent causes include dance fitness, massage therapy, painting bike lanes, salad bars in school cafeterias, pet neutering and urban gardening. ""The core of public health used to be society’s interest in securing the conditions necessary for human survival—mainly meaning epidemiology and combating communicable diseases. The pity is that all too often the current CDC has diluted its mission and budget by funding political causes that the doctors and troops in West Africa (and Texas) don’t need. The list extends to anti-bullying, trans fats, prescription opiate abuse, college rape prevention, workplace wellness, ‘racial and ethnic approaches to community health,’ and promoting breast feeding."" We’ll set aside the editorial’s belittling tone toward efforts to combat bullying, drug abuse and rape, and instead investigate the questions it raises about the fund and how it allocates funding. The fund was established with the passage of the Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare) in 2010. Initially, it was supposed to be funded by $15 billion over its first 10 years; legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama in 2012 cut that amount by $5 billion over 10 years. The purpose of the fund is ""to provide expanded and sustained national investments in prevention and public health, to improve health outcomes, and to enhance health care quality."" In practice, CDC provides grants to local governments and nonprofits, who then decide how to spend the money to meet public health goals.  However, the fund has proved to be ""a tempting target for policy makers of both parties,"" according to an analysis of the fund published in the journal Health Affairs. The authors of the Health Affairs analysis wrote that it ""got off to a rocky start,"" due to complaints by both liberals and conservatives. Liberals expressed concern that Obama was gutting the fund by agreeing to the cuts, which supported the continuation of payroll tax breaks, an extension of unemployment benefits and a ""fix"" to prevent cuts to physician reimbursement under Medicare -- items that had little if anything to do with preventing disease. Conservatives, for their part, questioned whether the fund needed to exist at all, particularly in a time of growing federal debt. Some Republicans proposed eliminating the fund and using some of the proceeds to pay for repeal of the Affordable Care Act's requirement that small-business owners file 1099 tax reporting forms, Health Affairs reported. Meanwhile, Republicans also questioned whether the government should be paying for things that people can do for free, like exercise. Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., the ranking member on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, dismissed it as a ""slush fund ... to build sidewalks, jungle gyms, and swing sets."" We were only able to document broad categories of spending from the fund; once we drilled down into online disclosure forms for grants, they didn’t cite such specific details as ""jazzercise,"" ""urban gardening"" or ""massage therapy.""  But when we asked public-health experts whether such categories could have been spent on the kinds of activities Gardner criticized, they said it’s likely. The fund’s mission is to ""improve health and prevent chronic illnesses by expanding preventive care and supporting proven community-based programs that reduce obesity, tobacco use and other preventable conditions, and I would think that healthy food and physical activity efforts would fit right in,"" said Elizabeth Rigby, an associate professor of public policy and public administration at George Washington University. Glen Mays, a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Public Health, agreed. ""Are there scientifically proven prevention strategies that involve helping people reach recommended levels of daily exercise through organized group activities like ‘jazzercise, urban gardening, or other forms of physical activity? Absolutely,"" Mays said, citing CDC’s Diabetes Prevention Program and WISEWOMAN program. ""Beyond their exercise benefits, gardening programs also have been shown to increase knowledge of and access to healthy food choices, especially in urban and rural food deserts,"" Mays said, and in certain contexts, massage therapy could fit as well. Bottom line: We aren’t 100 percent sure that CDC dollars have been spent on jazzercise, urban gardens or massage therapy, but it’s quite possible they have been. Does Gardner’s focus accurately describe what the fund does? No, it’s pretty misleading. Here’s a flavor of how CDC plans to spend money from the Prevention and Public Health Fund in fiscal year 2014. (CDC is only one of several federal agencies that’s able to spend money from the fund, though we’ll limit our analysis to CDC because of how Gardner framed his claim.) • Immunization: $160 million; • Smoking prevention: $105 million; • Cancer prevention and control: $104 million; • Heart disease and stroke prevention: $77 million; • Diabetes prevention: $73 million; • Epidemiology and laboratory capacity: $40 million; • Nutrition, physical activity, and obesity: $39 million; • Racial and ethnic approaches to community health: $30 million; • Lead poisoning prevention: $13 million; • Infection prevention in health care facilities: $12 million; • Workplace wellness: $10 million; • Breastfeeding promotion and support: $8 million; • Miscellaneous prevention efforts: $160 million; The total for all these activities: $831 million. More than half went for categories that would be irrelevant for the items Gardner cites. And even within the $300 million-plus spent on items such as preventing obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer, experts are certain that items such as jazzercise represent a tiny fraction of what CDC is spending. The plan’s critics have chosen the silliest-sounding items -- an effective rhetorical tactic, but not a very honest one. (As for the Wall Street Journal editorial’s complaint that CDC has abandoned its traditional role in ""combating communicable diseases,"" we’ll note that the single biggest spending item from the fund is for immunizations.) How solid is the argument that prevention funding should be shifted to Ebola? When the preventive fund was created, lawmakers explicitly tilted the authority for disbursing the funds toward the executive branch, rather than Congress, so there shouldn’t be insurmountable roadblocks to shifting money around. So CDC -- or the agency it reports to, the Department of Health and Human Services -- could probably switch dollars around if it wished. But as it happens, there’s really no need to switch money out of the fund, since the fund can be used directly to pay for Ebola expenses. Remember that $12 million we noted above that’s targeted for ""infection prevention in health care facilities"" for 2014? That’s relevant because, ""right now in the United States, Ebola is exclusively a hospital-acquired infection,"" Mays said. Indeed, Mays added, the prevention fund is already funding the CDC’s Epidemiology, Laboratory Capacity, and Emerging Infections program, which ""supports exactly the types of testing, contact tracing, and remediation activities that are underway by state and local health departments in Texas and Ohio in response to Ebola."" So Gardner is confusing matters by making it prevention vs. Ebola. It doesn’t have to be. There’s also another issue to consider. We can see why people might chuckle at the thought of federal money going to jazzercise, but it’s important not to lose sight of the fund’s purpose -- prevention. ""Prevention"" has been part of the official name of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 1992, when George H.W. Bush was president. The ""P"" never made it into the agency’s common acronym -- and prevention is not as swashbuckling a sector as some divisions of CDC -- but it’s an important part of the agency’s mission nonetheless. Why? Take a look at the death statistics for diseases covered by grants from the fund. (The figures cover 2010, the most recent year available). • Heart disease: 596,577 deaths; • Cancer: 576,691 deaths; • Stroke: 128,932 deaths; • Diabetes: 73,831 deaths; • Influenza and Pneumonia: 53,826 deaths. That’s more than 1.4 million deaths annually from what medical experts, including the CDC, consider preventable diseases -- compared to (so far) just one from Ebola in the United States. This doesn’t mean we should be spending zero on Ebola; nor does it mean the fund can prevent anything approaching to 1.4 million deaths a year. It doesn’t even mean that the fund is spending the right amount of money, or for the right things. What it does mean is that Gardner’s flip dismissal of preventive-health efforts obscures the imbalance in the number of lives at stake every year. Our ruling Gardner said the CDC is ""spending money on things like jazzercise, urban gardening and massage therapy"" that could be redirected Ebola. We weren’t able to document such expenditures, but given the agency’s spending parameters, it’s certainly possible they’ve been made. However, by cherry-picking three chuckle- (or outrage-) inducing spending items, Gardner presents a misleading description of what the fund does. Those efforts almost certainly represent a tiny fraction of spending from the prevention fund, which is dominated by efforts to attack diseases that kill more than 1.4 million people every year, rather than one so far with Ebola. The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7FCF00>],/factchecks/2014/oct/20/cory-gardner/amid-ebola-cases-cory-gardner-blasts-cdc-spending-/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Missouri', 'Parker Briden']","
Governor's spokesman fudges on education funding, performance
","Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens likes to talk about education, often critically. Greitens’ press secretary, Parker Briden, said funding has increased for K-12 schools. ""It is one of our missions to create better schools,"" Briden told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Nov. 13. ""You hear us talking about it all the time. We’ve seen funding increases for schools. We haven’t seen a corresponding performance increase."" With funding cuts coming to a lot of areas from Greitens’ budget, especially higher education, we wanted to see whether Briden’s statement was true. The funding Briden did not respond to our questions, so we decided to start by looking at the general operating budget for the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. For fiscal year 2016, $5.8 billion went to the department. This was about an $88 million increase from 2015. The budget in 2017, showed an increase from 2016’s total to about $5.9 billion. This increase happened despite about a $13 million decrease to the the portion of federal funds for the department. For Greitens’ first budget, fiscal year 2018, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education saw an increase to about $6.03 billion. So, on face value, there has been an overall increase in general funding for schools over the past few years. The budget just lists the funding for the department. The actual appropriations bill is what breaks it down, and it’s clear that not all of the $6.03 billion goes directly to the kids. Traci Gleason, director of communication and public engagement at the Missouri Budget Project, points out that the cost of educating students fluctuates . ""While an appropriation may technically be higher, without being increased for inflation as well, the value of that increase diminishes. For instance, for schools, the costs of their supplies, teacher salaries, maintenance, etc., go up, so increases need to take that into account,"" she said. A dollar in 2015, when the 2016 budget was passed, is equal to $1.06 today. That means to keep pace with the $5.8 billion granted to K-12 education in fiscal year 2016, the 2018 budget would need to allot $6.15 billion. So, on an inflation-adjusted basis, the money allocated is less than it was three years ago. Student Performance Briden said there has not been a performance increase to match the funding increase. So we looked at data for student performance on standardized tests. Sarah Potter, the communications coordinator for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, said Briden is wrong. Missouri Assessment Program, or MAP, is the primary measure for K-12 schools in Missouri. MAP scores actually increased in all content areas between 2016 and 2017. English language arts saw a 1 percent increase, math saw a 1.4 percent increase, science saw a 2.1 percent increase, and American government saw a 1.7 percent increase. Potter said the governor’s office is referring to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, in which the state went up in two measures and down in two measures between 2011 and 2015. But this data is older, and new results won’t be out until February. Our ruling Parker Briden, the governor’s press secretary, said, ""We’ve seen funding increases for schools. We haven’t seen a corresponding performance increase."" While state funding has increased, it’s not keeping up with inflation. Meanwhile, student scores on the MAP test have increased. The results of a national test are mixed, not down, and in any case are outdated. We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7F3D00>],/factchecks/2017/dec/26/parker-briden/governors-spokesman-fudges-education-funding-perfo/

Cora Faith Walker mostly right on life expectancy disparities in St. Louis
","In a Nov. 9 guest commentary for the St. Louis American, Rep. Cora Faith Walker, D-Ferguson, wrote that funding cuts to Medicaid programs would further hurt African-American communities. ""The average life expectancy for African-Americans in Saint Louis and Saint Louis County varies by as much as 18 years compared to the white population, with nearly half of all African-American kids under the age of 18 living in poverty,"" Walker wrote. Those are striking statistics, so we reached out to Walker to find out where she got them. She sent us a copy of a 2015 ""For the Sake of All"" report, which analyzes ""the health and well-being of African Americans in St. Louis."" Walker also outlined the primary sources cited in the report. We reached out to the report’s project directors to find out where these stats came from. Walker wrote that the average life expectancy for African-Americans in St. Louis City and St. Louis County varies by as much as 18 years compared to the white population. Where does that information come from? For the Sake of All project director Jason Purnell told us the figure comes from a comparison between residents in the ZIP code 63106 in the city and the ZIP zip code 63105 in the county. For the Sake of All’s report breaks down the differences in life expectancy for different ZIP  codes within St. Louis city and county. On page 27 of the report, a map showing life expectancy at birth by ZIP code is accompanied by this description: ""A child born in 63106 near the Jeff-Vander-Lou neighborhood can expect to live 18 fewer years than a child born in 63105 (Clayton), 15 fewer years than a child born in 63017 (Chesterfield), 14 fewer years than children born in 63122 (Kirkwood) and 63109 (St. Louis Hills), and 3 years fewer than a child born in 63133 (Pagedale/Wellston),"" the report says. Research Project Coordinator Rachel Barth said the life expectancies were constructed using a calculator developed by the City of St. Louis Department of Health – Center for Health Information, Planning, and Research, and life expectancies by ZIP code were derived using population counts from the 2010 Census and deaths from the Missouri Information for Community Assessment’s 2010 data. To be clear, the data aren’t comparing life expectancies by race. Walker is extrapolating that based on what she knows about the ZIP  codes analyzed. The report notes that the areas with lowest life expectancies — such as ZIP code 63106 that has an average life expectancy of 67 years — ""are also in areas with the highest concentration of African-American population."" ""We do not have calculations for life expectancy by race,"" Barth told PolitiFact Missouri. However, ZIP code 63105, which includes Clayton, is predominately white — which is where Walker may have based her assertion ""compared to the white population."" ""What I think Rep. Walker is getting at is the life expectancy for residents living in 63106 (95 percent of whom are African-American) is 67 years, whereas the life expectancy for residents living in 63105 (92 percent of whom are white) is 85 years of age,"" Barth said. To summarize, Walker is comparing ZIP  codes in the St. Louis area and identifying where the greatest life expectancy disparity exists. Those ZIP  codes align with overwhelmingly African-American or white populations. However, there may be other variables that weren’t considered in the study that have an effect on the average life expectancy. Walker went on to say that ""nearly half of all African-American kids under the age of 18 (are) living in poverty."" That’s from the same report, but the statistic is outdated and relies on 2012 Census information. In 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 46 percent of African-American children under 18 lived in poverty in St. Louis County and St. Louis City, Barth said. According to the more recent Census Bureau estimate from 2016, the figure has fallen to 33 percent, Barth said. The decrease coincides with the improvement of the economy in Missouri. Walker said ""the average life expectancy for African Americans in Saint Louis and Saint Louis County varies by as much as 18 years compared to the white population, with nearly half of all African-American kids under the age of 18 living in poverty."" Walker based this assertion on a study showing a wide difference in life expectancy between two ZIP codes within the city and county of St. Louis. That’s not exactly a comparison of life expectancy by race, but given that one ZIP code is heavily African-American and the other is heavily white, it’s a reasonable proxy. As for the poverty claim, the rate remains high, but the 50 percent figure is based on old data. More recent estimates find that about a third of African-American children in the St. Louis area are living in poverty. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB4AA00>],/factchecks/2017/dec/25/cora-faith-walker/Cora-Faith-Walker-mostly-right-on-life-expectancy/

No solid evidence that tax cuts created jobs
","U.S. Rep. Jason Smith sent out a tweet last month paralleling job growth with tax cuts, citing the George W.Bush, Reagan and Kennedy administrations. The tweet, sent Nov. 13, championed the House’sTax Cut and Jobs Act: ""America needs the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct. Check out the record of #jobs created by #TaxCuts 7.8 million new jobs after Bush’s 2003 tax cuts 12 million new jobs after Kennedy's 1964 tax cuts 14.8 MILLION new jobs after Ronald Reagan’s tax cuts in 1981."" We reached out to Smith’s office to see where he got his information, and spokeswoman Maggie Starks said the numbers came from the White House. The White House looked at how jobs grew over a five-year period after each president signed tax legislation. We wanted to know if the administrations’ respective tax cuts really created this many jobs. How did they get their numbers? The White House started calculating job growth in January of the year the tax cuts were enacted, regardless of the laws not being signed until February 1964, August 1981 and May 2003. President George W. Bush signed two large tax cuts into law during his time in office: The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. Smith cited onlythe latter tax reform law, which cut taxes on individual rates, capital gains, dividends and estate, among other changes. The law went into effect at the end of May 2003, but the White House started its calculations in January. In the first month of 2003, U.S.employment numbers were at 130.6 million jobs; five years later, there were 138.4 million jobs. This is an increase of about 7.8 million jobs, which is what Smith (and the White House) said were created. President John F. Kennedy's brainchild, the Revenue Act of 1964, was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on Feb. 26, 1964. It reduced individual tax rates and top corporate tax rates, phased in a faster corporate estimated tax payments and created a minimum standard deduction. We started looking at job growth beginning in January of that year like the White House did. In January 1964, there were 57.5 million jobs available. Fast forwarding five years, there were 69.4 million jobs, showing an increase of about 12 million jobs, right on par with Smith’s claim. In August 1981, President Ronald Reagan signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 into law. A main component of the law was a phased-in 23 percent cut in individual tax rates over three years, which brought the highest marginal tax rate from 70 to 50 percent. In January 1981, the start of the year the tax cuts went into effect, there were about 91 million jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The same time five years later, the number was at 98.7 million jobs. This is an increase of 7.7 million jobs, over 7.1 million less than Smith claimed. Taxes aren’t the only aspect that affect an economy, and it’s hard to prove if they can have that big of an impact on jobs, said Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute. ""At any particular time there are many forces affecting the economy — tax policy, regulations, monetary policy, the economic growth of our trading partners, energy prices, etc.,"" he said. Edwards said the tax cuts probably did help businesses create jobs, but there was so much else going on during those time periods that no economist could pinpoint the overall jobs picture to one policy change. Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar at American Enterprise Institute, echoed Edwards’ statement, and said, ""it’s hard to establish between tax cuts and the number of jobs created because there are too many confounding factors associated with tax changes that could have led to the job growth."" She also said that putting a precise number to job growth associated with any particular tax reform or tax change is fraught with uncertainty. Lee Price, former chief economist of the House Appropriations Committee and fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, said although jobs went up in the years after the named tax cuts, one could also argue that the tax hikes of 1993 and 2010 were responsible for the creation of millions of jobs for the following several years. The Institute for Policy Studies is a progressive think tank in Washington D.C. Price also noted that the 1981 Reagan tax cut was followed by substantial tax hikes in subsequent years that didn't appear to slow job growth. Smith claimed that the Bush, Kennedy and Reagan administrations signed into law tax cuts that created millions of jobs by saying, ""America needs the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct. Check out the record of #jobs created by #TaxCuts 7.8 million new jobs after Bush’s 2003 tax cuts 12 million new jobs after Kennedy's 1964 tax cuts 14.8 MILLION new jobs after Ronald Reagan’s tax cuts in 1981."" Jobs were created after each of the laws went into effect, but some of Smith’s numbers were off, and experts agree that there are too many factors that create jobs to simply say tax cuts are the reason.

McCaskill overreaches on fentanyl figures
","Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., is requesting information from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the United States Postal Services and the U.S. Department of States regarding a drug she claims is illegally making its way into the country. In a press release from Nov. 22, 2017, the senator said, ""Fentanyl is now killing more Americans than heroin or any other opioid, and we should use every tool at our disposal to keep it from entering the United States."" The number of opioid overdose deaths has been getting a lot of attention in recent years, but is fentanyl now the leading cause? What is fentanyl? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fentanyl is a synthetic, or man-made, opioid sold legally as a pharmaceutical drug to treat pain. It is also illegally made and is increasingly used to intensify the effects (or ""high"") of other drugs, such as heroin. Most recent cases of fentanyl-related overdose and death have been linked to illicitly-manufactured fentanyl. Heroin is an opioid synthesized from morphine that can be a white or brown powder, or a black sticky substance. Heroin is an illegal, highly-addictive opioid, typically injected but also smoked and snorted. Although fentanyl is similar to heroin, fentanyl is 30 to 50 times more potent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.    Have overdose deaths increased? There was a 21 percent increase nationally in overall overdose deaths from 2016 to 2017. The CDC categorizes six types of drugs, with fentanyl part of the ""synthetic opioids excluding methadone."" Fentanyl-related deaths are on the rise. A 2016 study of 10 states over six months detected fentanyl in 56.3 percent of 5,152 synthetic opioid deaths. The CDC reported a total of 20,145 overdose deaths, up from 9,445 in 2015, which means the number of overdoses related to synthetic opioids excluding methadone more than doubled between 2016 and 2017. Sarah Feldman, the deputy communication director for McCaskill, told us that ""the term ‘synthetic opioids excluding methadone’ is, according to the CDC, exclusively represented by ‘fentanyl and fentanyl analogs.’"" But CDC spokeswoman Courtney Lenard said the synthetic opioids category isn’t exclusive to fentanyl. She gave an example as prescription pain reliever tramadol, which isn’t fentanyl-based. In other words, fentanyl and fentanyl analogs are a subset of synthetic opioids. ""Fentanyl deaths cannot be separated out,"" Lenard said. Our ruling Sen. McCaskill said, ""Fentanyl is now killing more Americans than heroin or any other opioid."" The CDC says illegally manufactured fentanyl is primarily responsible for the increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids in 10 states. But fentanyl and fentanyl analogs aren’t the only synthetic opioids claiming lives. There is no breakdown of fentanyl from the larger synthetic category number. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA840C0>],/factchecks/2017/dec/22/claire-mccaskill/mccaskill-overreaches-fentanyl-figures/

Will the Republican tax law raise middle-class taxes?
","Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand claims the major tax overhaul passed by Congress this week will increase tax bills for middle-class earners in New York state. Gillibrand, in Buffalo on Dec 15, said filers who pay state and local taxes in New York state will be hit particularly hard by the legislation. ""I'm concerned, obviously, about this tax bill because it's going to raise taxes on the middle class,"" Gillibrand said. ""The truth is this tax [plan] raises middle-class taxes. For all New Yorkers who pay local and state taxes, it’s going to be very difficult, because they’re going to have to pay a lot more money."" Gillibrand made the claim before Republicans released their final tax bill, a compromise between versions passed in the House and Senate. We’re basing our fact check on details that were available at the time. Was she right that middle-class earners will see higher taxes under the Republican plan? Other tax benefits Research groups across the political spectrum agree that the middle class will benefit from provisions in the tax law -- at least at first. The standard deduction will double to $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for married filers. That change was also in the Senate bill. More filers will come out ahead using the standard deduction instead of itemizing state and local taxes. A majority of middle-income filers already take the standard deduction instead of itemizing. About 44 percent of those making between $50,000 and $75,000 deduct state and local taxes in New York state according to the Tax Policy Center. Even in states like New York, where a third of taxpayers deduct their state and local taxes from their federal tax, the new limits on those deductions are not likely to result in higher overall tax bills. Tax rates for middle-income earners will go down. Those making between about $38,000 and $70,000 will see their federal tax rate decrease from 25 percent to 22 percent, for example. Middle-income filers will also benefit from a provision to double the child tax credit to $2,000. For those who owe little or no taxes, up to $1,400 of that credit is refundable. ""The good news for taxpayers is that every income group would pay less in taxes in 2019,"" according to a PolitiFact analysis.  The analysis was based on data from the Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan group that analyzes tax bills for Congress, and the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation. Down the road The Joint Committee on Taxation predicted that taxpayers making $40,000 and up would see a tax cut immediately until 2025 under the law. In 2019, filers at every income level will see a tax cut. The average person making $45,000 would see the amount of their income spent on federal taxes decrease from 10.9 percent to 9.9 percent, according to the committee's report.   The tax benefit shifts after 2025 when most changes for individual filers expire, including the lower tax brackets and cap on state and local tax deductions. After the individual provisions expire, all filers who make $75,000 or less annually will see a tax increase. ""Only those income ranges above $75,000 still see a cut by 2027,"" according to the PolitiFact analysis. ""That’s a significantly different pattern than in 2019, when every group saves, on average."" Republicans hope a future Congress will extend the individual provisions. Experts believe that’s likely, though it’s not guaranteed. Our ruling Gillibrand said the Republican ""tax [plan] raises middle-class taxes."" That's not true during the first years of the new tax provisions. If not for the sunset for the tax changes for individuals, we likely would have rated Gillibrand's statement False or perhaps Mostly False. Middle-income taxpayers will either benefit or see no change in their tax liability through 2025. But her claim could hold up after the bill's individual provisions expire that year. There's no guarantee a future Congress will extend those parts of the bill.  So for that reason, her statement is partially true but still ignores important details. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EA9F9EC0>],/factchecks/2017/dec/22/kirsten-gillibrand/will-republican-tax-law-raise-middle-class-taxes/
"['Infrastructure', 'Wisconsin', 'Matt Adamczyk']","
One Wisconsin state agency has rented space in the same building since 1974?
","Jay Weber, a conservative talk show host on WISN-AM in Milwaukee, started a segment on his Dec. 15, 2017 show by bemoaning how much the State of Wisconsin ""wastes"" on rent for office space. He then introduced state Treasurer Matt Adamczyk, a Republican notable for campaigning on a pledge to work to eliminate the position. Adamczyk, who was elected in November 2014, argued that taxpayers are ""getting ripped off"" by the state renting space near the Capitol building, rather than buying buildings or building new ones. Giving one example, Adamczyk claimed the state courts agency ""basically"" has rented the same office space across from the state Capitol ""since 1974."" He’s correct -- even if it’s not clear that his implication, that the state is wasting money, is on target. The space Steve Michels, a spokesman for GOP Gov. Scott Walker’s Department of Administration, and Bob Lang, director of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, confirmed that the Director of State Courts office has leased space across from the Capitol, in the Tenney Plaza building at 110 E. Main St. in Madison, since 1974. The landlord is Tenney LLC. The owner is Urban Land Investments Inc.   It’s been a bipartisan pattern. That span covers the administrations of eight governors -- four Democrats (Patrick Lucey, Martin Schreiber, Anthony Earl and Jim Doyle) and four Republicans (Lee Dreyfus, Tommy Thompson, Scott McCallum and Walker). Adamczyk provided lease documents showing that the Department of Administration most recently renewed the lease in January 2017. It’s a five-year lease, for 57,215 square feet, that started in October 2017. The first year’s rent is $1.35 million. With annual increases of 1.75 percent, the lease payment for the fifth year will be $1.45 million. A few points before we close: Lang and Michels told us that a renegotiation for the current lease produced a 23 percent reduction in the rent there, saving about $2.5 million. Adamczyk hasn’t spelled out where in a state-owned building the courts agency might go, what the savings might be and what other issues would come with owning rather than renting. As part of a separate branch of government, the courts agency generally has the authority to choose its own office space, Michels said. Our rating Railing against the state leasing office space as being too expensive, Adamczyk says the state courts agency ""basically"" has rented the same office space across from the Capitol ""since 1974."" He’s correct, although he doesn’t offer evidence indicating there is a viable alternative for the agency that would save money.

"['Immigration', 'Crime', 'Texas', 'Lupe Valdez']","
Unauthorized immigrants account for few crimes, but precise percentage seems elusive
","Long before Democrat Lupe Valdez declared her candidacy for governor, she differed with Republican incumbent Greg Abbott over the change in law put in place by Texas lawmakers this year to bar local communities from harboring immigrants living in the country illegally. The state’s sanctuary cities bar, which as of December 2017 remained partially blocked by a federal judge’s ruling under state appeal, empowers local police officers to inquire into a person’s immigration status during routine encounters such as traffic stops. The law also requires local law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration agents and to go along with detention requests placed on inmates suspected of illegal immigration. Senate Bill 4 imposes stiff fines and criminal charges on government officials who choose to ignore it. In July 2017, according to a Dallas Morning News story, Abbott defended the law before the Sheriff’s Association of Texas, saying it ""would remove from the streets dangerous criminals, not detain hardworking families and innocent children. I appreciate the strong support the law has received from so many sheriffs across Texas,"" Abbott said. That story also quoted Valdez, then Dallas County’s fourth-term sheriff, calling the law a political tool to attack vulnerable Texans. ""Throughout history, we've had a vulnerable group to pick on,"" Valdez said. ""Now it seems to be Hispanics,"" Valdez said. Valdez further said that Texas Department of Public Safety numbers show that only 1.6 percent of crime is committed by unauthorized immigrants, according to the story. National research suggests that residents living in the U.S. without legal permission don’t account for a lot of crime. But we fell short of eliciting a full unpacking from Valdez about how she reached the 1.6 percent statistic nor did we independently find a way to confidently settle on a specific percentage. Seeking Valdez's factual backup After Valdez resigned as sheriff to launch her bid for governor, we asked how she reached the 1.6 percent figure. By email, a campaign aide, Kiefer Odell, pointed us to Valdez’s Dec. 10, 2015 testimony before the Texas House Committee on State Affairs. At Odell’s nudge, we watched the Texas Legislative Council’s video of the hearing, which opened with the panel chairman, Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, saying that according to the DPS, ""there are over 176,000 criminal immigrants that have been booked into our local Texas jails between 2011 and 2015"" on almost 500,000 criminal charges, Cook said, including homicide, sexual assault, kidnapping, burglary, theft and robbery ""and,"" Cook said, ""these are only those that are reported crimes. ""Clearly this presents a public safety crisis in our state,"" Cook said before going on to say that legislators would focus in advance of the 2017 session on legislation to restrict sanctuary cities. Valdez challenged the need for such legislation while stressing that the Dallas County sheriff’s office was complying with individual federal requests to detain individuals suspected of living in the country without permission. ""Jails should be for people we’re afraid of,"" Valdez testified, ""not for people we’re upset with.""  She also said: ""The undocumenteds are no more likely to commit crimes than our native-born citizens."" A legislator asked Valdez to speak to her foundation for the latter statement. The sheriff replied: ""Well, as you heard before, the director said 170,000 crimes were committed by undocumenteds in four years. That’s out of 11 million 100,000 and something. And when you bring that right down, it came out to 1.76 percent, and we rounded off to 1.8 percent of the crimes committed in Texas during the same time period. ""So under 2 percent of the crimes were committed, that we have record of, for all, either documented or undocumented, it was 2 percent of the actual crimes,"" Valdez said. We asked Odell to share the source and significance of the 11.1 million figure offered by Valdez toward reaching her conclusion that less than 2 percent of Texas crimes from 2011-15 could be attributed to unauthorized residents. We didn’t hear back on that. DPS spokesman points to a web page We also queried the DPS about Valdez’s ""1.6 percent"" claim; spokesman Tom Vinger offered no comment though he pointed by email to an undated DPS web page, ""Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data,"" lacking in information that in itself would confirm or invalidate Valdez’s claim. As of December 2017, the page said that more than 238,000  ""criminal aliens"" had been booked into Texas county jails from June 2011 through November 2017 and those booked individuals had, in their respective lives, accumulated 632,000 criminal charges. There was no data on the DPS web page about other arrested or convicted residents and no estimate of the share of arrests accumulated by unauthorized U.S. residents. A cautionary note about the DPS presentation: A ""criminal alien,"" the Government Accountability Office notes, is a non-citizen convicted of a crime who may be lawfully or unlawfully living in the country. This definition makes it likely that not everyone described in the DPS summary was living in the U.S. illegally, which makes it hard to decipher what to make of the counts on the page. Rough calculations Hoping for other insights into the share of people living here illegally who commit crimes, we reached out to other criminal justice experts. By email, Austin-based Tony Fabelo, a researcher for the Council of State Governments Justice Center, offered a back-of-the-envelope approach to gauging Valdez’s claim using the posted DPS numbers. Fabelo wrote that annualizing DPS’s tally of more than 238,000 ""criminal aliens"" booked into jails over six-plus years, as posted as of December 2017, suggests a rate of 39,000 such bookings a year. ""Not all arrests lead to a jail booking, but let us assume they do,"" Fabelo said. That in mind, he went on, the DPS for 2016 separately reported more than 758,000 adult arrests for criminal offenses in the state. So, Fabelo said, bookings of unauthorized residents may have accounted for about 5 percent of all such adult arrests--a figure exceeding Valdez’s declared percentage (though this rough figure, we noticed, also couldn’t account for the fact that not all ""criminal aliens"" are living in the country without legal permission). Next, we applied the same methodology to a figure that Valdez noted in her 2015 testimony. In the five years from 2011 through 2015, annual DPS crime reports indicate there were 4,389,998 adults arrested in Texas for criminal offenses--making it possible to say, we calculated, that the 170,000 Cook-described arrests of ""criminal immigrants"" amounted to about 4 percent of all the adult arrests in the state. Now if Cook was referring only to arrests from 2011 to 2015--his comment at the hearing was unclear on the timeframe--then we calculated that the 170,000 ""criminal immigrants"" may have accounted for 4.7 percent of 3,613,691 total adult arrests from 2011 through 2014. But absent expert analysis, we wouldn't brandish these conclusions as facts. National research Precise percentages aside, PolitiFact researchers have found that unauthorized residents don’t account for more crime than other residents. In August 2017, most recently, PolitiFact California followed on a 2016 PolitiFact fact-check and found Mostly True a claim that undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native Americans. That fact-check noted a 2015 National Academy of Sciences study that cited another outfit’s report including, we noticed, a 1.6 percent reference, though the figure in this instance reflected on male immigrants only. Let’s revisit it. The July 2015 report from the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit, generally states that U.S. Census Bureau data support the conclusion that immigrants are less likely than native-born Americans to be behind bars, though the report doesn’t present figures limited to unauthorized residents. ""According to an original analysis of data from the 2010 American Community Survey (ACS) conducted by the authors of this report, roughly 1.6 percent of immigrant males age 18-39 are incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born,"" the report says. ""This disparity in incarceration rates has existed for decades, as evidenced by data from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 decennial censuses. In each of those years, the incarceration rates of the native-born were anywhere from two to five times higher than that of immigrants."" The report also delves into crime in Texas cities: ""The most thoroughly studied aspect of this phenomenon has been the drop in rates of violent crime since the early 1990s in cities that have long been ‘gateways’ for immigrants entering the United States, such as Miami, Chicago, El Paso, San Antonio, and San Diego. However, the inverse relationship between immigration and crime is also apparent in ‘new’ immigrant gateways, such as Austin, where rates of both violent crime and serious property crime have declined despite high levels of new immigration. Declining rates of property crime have also been documented in metropolitan areas across the country. Some scholars suggest that new immigrants may revitalize dilapidated urban areas, ultimately reducing violent crime rates."" Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher for the council, told PolitiFact in 2016 that immigrants come to the U.S. to build better lives for themselves and their children. ""They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police,"" Ewing said. ""This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence."" We asked Ewing to speak to Valdez’s 1.6 percent claim. By email, Ewing said he didn’t know ""of any source of information that would allow that precise of an estimate of the share of crime attributable to undocumented immigrants. If there is a solid source for those numbers, I’d love to know what it is,"" Ewing wrote. The council’s conclusion was echoed in a 2017 report from the libertarian Cato Institute stating, in part, that U.S. ""immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than natives relative to their shares of the population. Even illegal immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans,"" Cato said. To be specific, the report said that in 2014, per Cato’s analysis rooted in the ACS, illegal immigrants aged 18 to 54 were 44 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives in the age group. That report also took note of a February 2016 Texas Tribune news story that drew on information obtained from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice to estimate that 4.6 percent of Texas inmates were illegal immigrants upon whom federal authorities had placed detainer requests. At about that time, the story said, an estimated 1.7 million illegal immigrants comprised 6.3 percent of the state’s population. We also asked Cato analyst Alex Nowrasteh to review Valdez’s claim. By phone, Nowrasteh said it looked to him like some figures may have gotten confused. The 11.1 million number Valdez offered at the House committee hearing, Nowrasteh said, might trace to a widely-cited estimate of 11 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S. in 2015, which was down from an estimated 11.3 million in 2009. Generally, Nowrasteh said, ""the government has been stingy about releasing facts about immigrants and crime. There’s no excuse for not releasing all the facts and data. It should be easy for the public to look up."" Our ruling Valdez said DPS numbers show that 1.6 percent of crime is committed by unauthorized immigrants. We didn’t find DPS figures or an understandable methodology to support a specific ""1.6 percent"" conclusion--nor did we work up what we’d consider a solid alternate estimate. Relevant data seems to be unavailable. Still, national research supports Valdez's point that people living in the U.S. illegally account for little crime. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

Charge that George P. Bush-led agency has repaired two homes since Hurricane Harvey oversimplifies
","Jerry Patterson says the fellow Republican who succeeded him as Texas land commissioner, George P. Bush, fixed very few homes in the months since Hurricane Harvey slapped ashore in August 2017. Patterson, otherwise confirming his 2018 candidacy for land commissioner, a post he previously held for 12 years, said in a recent interview that the Bush-led General Land Office hadn’t accomplished much in the way of hurricane relief. On Dec. 8, 2017, Patterson said to Austin American-Statesman commentator Ken Herman: ""I mean, who the hell’s in charge here? And now we have tens of thousands of Texans who are essentially homeless and the land office has repaired two--two homes. And we’ve got folks waking up that have been sleeping in tents and they got snow this morning. People are still sleeping in tents."" Patterson’s comment seemed potent given that the GLO announced in September 2017 it was teaming with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to hasten post-Harvey recovery in part by helping eligible survivors begin to patch up their homes--though full rebuilds weren’t in the mix. Bush said at the time: ""With the magnitude of the damage from Hurricane Harvey, there is no doubt this will require a long recovery. This agreement marks the beginning of a new model for simplifying and expediting the transition out of sheltering to short-term and long-term housing recovery efforts."" We focused this fact-check on Patterson’s insistence the GLO had only repaired two homes. Homeless--and tents? But Patterson’s other pokes also got our attention. How many Texans remain homeless due to the hurricane is hard to pin, we recently found. But a University of Texas expert, Gordon Wells, has estimated, based on flood insurance claims and satellite imagery, that at the least, more than 1 million Texas homes sustained flood damage though he told us that count could exceed 1.7 million. After Patterson spoke, we queried government officials about survivors in tents. By phone, the GLO’s Pete Phillips said some Aransas County residents, resistant to options such as out-of-town hotels, were residing in tents. Similarly, Bob Howard of FEMA’s Harvey response team responded by email: ""Every effort is made to ensure survivors are aware of available local, state and federal resources. Thus far, all tent-dwellers found by the field team have indicated they prefer to remain in their current status or are not eligible for federal disaster assistance."" Now let’s turn to Patterson’s focus on homes repaired with government help since Harvey and related rains flooded much of Southeast Texas. Patterson points to federal program We asked Patterson the basis of his numerical claim; he told us by phone that he was referring to two homes repaired as of early December 2017 through the federal Direct Assistance for Limited Home Repair (DALHR) program. Patterson, who said he’d drawn his tally of two from state-enlisted contractors and others he declined to identify, urged us to seek insight from elected leaders in counties hit by Harvey. We heard back from elected officials in two counties. Galveston County’s county judge, Mark Henry, said by phone that flooding due to Harvey had flooded 22,000 to 24,000 local homes with water an inch to eight feet deep. Henry, who volunteered that he’s a longtime friend to Patterson, said his office daily fields calls from residents awaiting help. Calling delayed  repairs ""frustrating,"" Henry said: ""As far as the why"" repairs have been delayed, Henry said, ""I don’t know and I don’t care. I want it to get done."" By email, a GLO spokeswoman,  Brittany Eck, specified that as of mid-December 2017, the agency along with FEMA had housed 56 Galveston County ""applicant households and 446 are in the process of receiving a direct housing solution."" Also by phone, Loyd Neal, Nueces County’s judge, expressed chagrin that no agency advanced dollars enabling the Coastal Bend Council of Governments to hire individuals to consider applicants for short-term housing help. By email, Eck countered that the GLO had guaranteed up to $200,000 in reimbursed administrative costs to the regional councils asked to help administer post-Harvey housing assistance. Eck said that after the Coastal Bend council declined to participate, GLO employees were carrying out the program in that region. Neal told us that nearly four months since Harvey’s arrival, FEMA-funded housing including trailers or manufactured homes had yet to be brought into Port Aransas, the island tourist town where, Neal elaborated, more than two-thirds of local hurricane-damaged condominiums had yet to reopen. ""It’s an absolute disgrace,"" Neal said, ""that the state of Texas and the federal government and whoever else is in charge of this have not responded. It’s the greatest bureaucratic buck-passing I’ve ever seen."" By email, Eck said that per FEMA in December 2017, 52 Nueces County households were in need of direct housing assistance. Correct count, but… We confirmed Patterson’s count of two homes whose DALHR repair projects had been completed with Eck and Phillips, a land office administrator. But those officials said Patterson’s claim gave short shrift to everything Harvey-related that Bush and the land office have undertaken and, Phillips said, to FEMA’s supervisory governing role. ""He is oversimplifying what is going on,"" Phillips said, and ""cherry-picking"" given that the federal government supports housing options including thousands of hotel rooms, two types of home repair and possibly temporary apartments or trailers or manufactured homes. At the state level too, Phillips elaborated, ""we’re always at the mercy of FEMA. They control the triage process"" including, Eck said, confidential lists of homeowners for GLO to contact about their possibly seeking partial repairs backed by federal aid. Patterson, commenting on Phillips’ general assessment of his claim, said by email that ""to be clear, I made a statement, and it turned out to be 100% factually accurate. None of the ‘context’ or ‘cherry-picking’ BS need apply."" DALHR in Texas In November 2017, Bush announced the completion of the first DALHR home-repair project in Dickinson, in Galveston County. A GLO press release said the project included electrical and plumbing repairs, wall insulation, sheet rock, siding repair and replacing kitchen and bathroom sinks and a bathtub. That release said DALHR ""provides permanent repairs for homeowners with moderate damages who lack available housing resources."" But not everybody qualifies, the release made clear, in that beneficiaries must have sustained a FEMA-verified loss of $17,000 or more after 18 inches of interior flooding or more--though Phillips told us the GLO later encouraged FEMA to drop the 18-inch requirement, a change that qualified an additional 2,600 homes for consideration. According to the release, interested homeowners had to clear another half dozen hurdles such as a lack of other applicable insurance coverage and that eligible damages wouldn't exceed $60,000 or half the pre-hurricane taxable assessed value of the home. Then again, Eck told us by email, the latter limit was subsequently relaxed to allow awards to pay for up to half of a home’s replacement value. The November release also said that funded repairs under DALHR ""are limited to real property components such as heating, plumbing, ventilation and air conditioning, walls, floors and ceilings,"" leaving our structural or engineering needs or any items covered by other aid. Varied aid offerings Let’s walk through some more of what the GLO and FEMA described as the programs they’re steering to Harvey survivors. Notably, Phillips said, and FEMA’s Howard confirmed, the teaming of the state agency with FEMA to coordinate short-term housing aid marked the first time a state agency had been given that front-line role. Eck said Gov. Greg Abbott ""tapped the GLO to help FEMA implement these programs three weeks after the storm, in part due to the enormity of the affected area. In all cases, the applicant must be approved for eligibility by FEMA and, if interested, agree to the terms of FEMA’s regulations. The GLO is processing eligible applicants for short-term housing programs as FEMA is making their information available to the agency,"" Eck wrote. By email, Eck wrote that individuals displaced by the hurricane and its aftermath were offered federally funded hotel stays by FEMA while they looked for longer-term housing. ""This program is currently housing 15,027 individuals in 1,334 hotels,"" Eck said. ""None of the programs provided by FEMA are designed to be a permanent home replacement or complete repair program,"" Eck added. ""The programs are designed to be short-term (up to 18 months) stopgap solutions while individuals work on long-term solutions."" Starting Nov. 18, 2017, Eck wrote, the agency through early December 2017 had contacted 664 households judged by FEMA to be potentially qualified for the program. She said those contacts led to 290 expressions of interest and 182 DALHR home inspections--with 67 homes pre-qualified for repairs and 13 work orders issued for builders to start. ""To date, two homes have had the work completed,"" Eck wrote. By email. FEMA’s Howard wrote: ""We believe it is two projects at this point."" Phillips said by phone that his DALHR goal was to complete more than 100 home projects by 2018; he said 36 builders were standing by ready to do the ""re-work"" on homes. Meantme, Phillips said, over 670 Texas families had received direct housing help by landing a trailer or manufactured home. At our request, FEMA’s Howard emailed us that agency’s daily Harvey fact sheet from the date that Patterson made his claim stating that 638 Texas families by then had been provided a trailer or manufactured home. As of mid-December, Howard told us by email, 8,057 Harvey survivors in the state still showed a need for a trailer or manufactured home and, he said, 2,600 of them remained under review for DAHLR aid. Otherwise, Phillips said, the GLO helped make available 40 apartment units in Wharton and also found 120 units of  ""corporate housing"" to be made available in Conroe, in both cases under FEMA-backed programs. Howard said that generally by Dec. 14, 2017, 894,606 Texas residents had registered for Harvey-tired FEMA assistance of one kind or another. Another Patterson-cited program Patterson further told us the GLO had failed to help Texans benefit from another FEMA offering, the Partial Repair and Essential Power for Sheltering (PREPS) program, which provides up to $20,000 enabling homeowners to shelter in their homes thanks to limited repairs and the restoration of power. Eck said by email that PREPS aid was being offered by FEMA separately in that beneficiaries need a local government to provide a 10 percent match for an award to be made. By phone, meantime, Phillips said GLO officials had judged PREPS to be of limited value because families getting awards end up practically camping at home. The DALHR program, Phillips said, gets families ""close to being whole."" Our ruling Patterson said that since Hurricane Harvey, the agency helmed by Bush has done just two home repairs. Patterson’s figure, confirmed by GLO, was accurate. However, this claim leaves out ample significant information such as FEMA’s overriding control of the complicated DALHR program, which isn't open to every homeowner and only funds partial repairs. Notably too, additional  homes were poised to qualify for or get repairs through DALHR at the time that Patterson spoke. We rate this statement Mostly True.

The bill’s provisions won’t be taking effect in time for the April 2018 filing season There isn’t anything in the tax bill that would take effect soon enough to change taxpayers’ filing choices in any significant way by April 2018. The bill’s provisions only address tax year 2018 and beyond. So in April, taxpayers will be filing their paperwork for tax year 2017 to the IRS -- that is, under existing tax law, not the new law. ""Most people will still be filing something that looks familiar to them from past years,"" said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. There is no ‘postcard’ filing plan for individual taxpayers There isn’t a postcard filing option today, and there’s nothing in the bill that would create one. The idea didn’t come from nowhere. In November, House Republicans touted their plan as one that could be accommodated by a postcard-sized form. The president liked the idea so much that he held one up and kissed it for the cameras when meeting with lawmakers at the White House. ""It's going to make life very simple,"" he said on Nov. 2, 2017. The only people that aren't going to like this is H&R Block. They're not going to be very happy. That's probably one of the only companies in the country that's not going to be thrilled."" But in the end, the bill didn't do much to make this idea a reality. The possibility of creating a postcard option ""is most likely one of many things the IRS will have to figure out and issue new regulations on,"" said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. But that’s not happening immediately, he said. Newton said that there is already a pretty easy way to file your tax returns -- the 1040EZ form. It looks like this, with just one page to fill out: ""While it’s not postcard-sized, it’s pretty simple, and whatever they end up with in the future will probably look a lot like that currently does,"" Newton said. The 1040EZ is also popular. According to IRS statistics for the 2015 tax year, 23.3 million tax filers used the 1040EZ. That’s about one of every six filers. Could the number of people using the 1040EZ increase due to the tax bill’s passage (albeit in 2019)? Rosenberg said the number might increase on the margins due to the raising of the standard deduction, which would save some taxpayers from itemizing -- something they would have to do on the full 1040 form. Still, he added, ""there are relatively few people who currently itemize who have a simple enough situation"" to shift to the 1040EZ. Trump’s walk-back When we contacted the White House, they referred us to a tweet sent by Ivanka Trump a few hours after her Fox & Friends interview.. Trump replied to a tweet by Miranda Yaver, a self-described Democratic political scientist, that said, ""Actually, @IvankaTrump, in April 2018 people will be doing their their 2017 taxes based on the current law."" Actually, @IvankaTrump, in April 2018 people will be doing their their 2017 taxes based on the current law. https://t.co/cZFiQ3QKJN Trump replied, ""Correct! All across America people will be thinking about how cumbersome the old tax code is & energized about upcoming simplification!"" Correct! All across America people will be thinking about how cumbersome the old tax code is & energized about upcoming simplification! https://t.co/HZZhmvK5Xc That may happen, but it doesn’t make her original remark correct. Our ruling Ivanka Trump tweeted that in April, ""the vast majority will be (filling out their taxes) on a single postcard."" That’s not the case. The recently passed bill takes effect for the 2018 tax year, which people will be filing returns on in April 2019 -- not this coming April. And there is no plan for a postcard filing option. Simple filing options already exist and are widely used, but tax experts do not expect a surge in their use as a result of the tax bill in April 2019. We rate her statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF542C0>],/factchecks/2017/dec/21/ivanka-trump/ivanka-trump-wrong-april-vast-majority-will-be-fil/
"['Taxes', 'New York', 'Claudia Tenney']","
Wealthy would do well under tax plan, contrary to Tenney's claim
","Rep. Claudia Tenney told a TV news station that the rich would not fare well under the Republican tax plan passed by the House last month. New York state’s highest earners would have paid more in taxes, said Tenney, a congresswoman from the Utica area. ""Unfortunately, the wealthy are, again, not going to do well in this bill,"" Tenney said. ""Unlike what you’re hearing from Chuck Schumer, he’s getting an awful lot of blowback from people down in New York City who are the highest earners in our state who are very upset because they’re actually going to pay more in taxes unlike what he’s claiming when he’s on the street."" Congress passed a final tax bill this week. The new version is a combination of ideas from the House and Senate plans. Tenney was speaking about the House bill that lawmakers passed last month, according to her spokesperson. She was among the four Republican lawmakers from New York state to vote for it. The state’s five other Republicans opposed the bill. Tenney also voted to approve the final tax bill. We’re basing our fact check on what the House bill included at the time of her statement. Was Tenney right? Would the House bill have hurt the wealthy? Bad for the wealthy Experts said one provision included in both bills would disproportionately harm high-income earners: eliminating state and local tax deductions. The House bill capped the deduction for local property taxes at $10,000 while ending the deduction for state income and sales tax altogether. The final tax bill keeps all state and local tax deductions while maintaining the $10,000 cap. ""That primarily affects people with really high incomes,"" said Len Burman, a co-founder of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. More than 90 percent of filers who make $200,000 or more deduct their state and local taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center. For extremely wealthy people, the benefits they would have gotten from the tax bill outweigh what they would have lost by not being able to deduct a higher amount of state and local taxes, experts said. And the cap would be a bigger thorn in the side for wealthy people in New York state since they pay higher local and state taxes than those in other states.  Tenney did not specify if she was talking about the wealthy in New York state or across the U.S. Her claim appears to be about the wealthy in the U.S. The information her office provided dealt with wealthy people overall in the U.S. -- not just New York state. If she was just talking about New York state's wealthy, experts said they, too, would still do well, but probably not as well as those in other states. Benefits for the wealthy All told, about 71 percent of those making more than $912,000 would have benefited from the House bill over the next decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. Similar research from the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning tax policy organization, found the top 1 percent of earners would have seen an increase in after-tax income of at least 3.3 percent by 2027 if the House bill became law. An analysis of the final tax bill by the Tax Policy Center found 75 percent of the top 1 percent of earners would get a tax cut in 2027. Unlike the House version, the final bill also lowers the top tax bracket from 39.6 percent to 37 percent. At no point would the majority of those earners have seen an increase in federal taxes because of the House bill, according to research from both groups. Among the provisions that give the wealthy a break: Our ruling Tenney said ""the wealthy are, again, not going to do well in this bill."" There can be many variables figured into each person's tax return. So generalizing the affects of a far-reaching tax bill can be tricky. But research shows that Tenney’s statement is wrong. Experts agree the wealthiest taxpayers would have come out ahead in the House tax plan. They may lose the deduction for state and local taxes, but research shows that loss is outweighed by other benefits. The final tax plan includes many of the same benefits for the wealthy as the House bill. We did not consider those for our ruling since Tenney was talking about the House bill. We rate her claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAAAE800>],/factchecks/2017/dec/21/claudia-tenney/wealthy-would-do-well-under-tax-plan-contrary-tenn/

Trump wrongly says end of mandate is 'essentially' Obamacare repeal
","In the middle of celebrating passage of a $1.5 trillion tax cut, President Donald Trump pivoted to what the bill did for another one of his major goals. ""We essentially repealed Obamacare because we got rid of the individual mandate, which was terrible,"" Trump said. ""And that was a primary source of funding of Obamacare."" During the campaign, Trump promised to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. While full-blown repeal eluded him and Republicans in 2017, a relatively late addition to the tax bill did hand him a partial victory. The individual mandate fines people who might be able to afford health insurance but choose not to buy it. The maximum penalty is the higher of 2.5 percent of income or a fine based on the number of adults and kids in the household. The new tax measure reduces the fine to zero. The question is, how far does ending the penalty go toward repealing the Affordable Care Act? And did revenues from the fines represent a primary source of money for the program? The money part is simple. In 2016, about 6.5 million households paid $3 billion in penalties. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number crunchers for Congress, reported that in 2017, government costs for the Affordable Care Act totalled nearly $120 billion. The penalties would cover less than 3 percent of that. Other revenue sources are more significant, including taxes on wealthy households -- about $16 billion, and health insurance companies -- about $12 billion. So Trump was wrong when he called the penalty money a primary source of funding. The experts we reached generally agreed that repealing the mandate would undermine the health care law, but key elements would remain intact. In broad strokes, without the penalty, fewer healthy people will buy insurance, which will make it more expensive to cover the people who do. (Reminder: This mainly affects the individual insurance market, which amounts to about 7 percent of all the people covered in the country.) The Congressional Budget Office estimated that repealing the mandate would drive up premiums by 10 percent. This would price some people out of the market, and turn away others who might have been ready to buy a plan if it were cheaper. After 10 years, 13 million fewer people would be insured. But even the CBO stressed how mushy any prediction is, noting that the actual impacts ""would probably be smaller than the numbers reported in this document."" The single-greatest coverage gains under the Affordable Care Act came through expanding Medicaid to all low-income adults. Overall, about 20 million people became insured. Of that, the CBO says Medicaid expansion reached 13 million people at a cost of about $70 billion in 2017. Even though Medicaid coverage is either free or very low-cost, eliminating the mandate would have some effect on the growth of that group. The CBO said that in 2027, about 5 million fewer people would be enrolled in Medicaid than the government analysts would otherwise expect. The logic is that fear of the mandate leads people to apply for insurance, at which point they discover they are eligible for Medicaid coverage. Without the stick of the mandate, they wouldn’t have applied. Whatever the scale of that effect, Medicaid expansion remains intact. Studies point in both directions on the impact that the mandate alone has on the individual market. When an earlier and similar law took effect in Massachusetts, enrollment jumped among healthy people. On the other hand, research based on the first few years of the national law through 2015 concluded that ""the individual mandate’s exemptions and penalties had little impact on coverage rates."" The big drivers were the hefty premium subsidies for private insurance and the expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults. Larry Levitt at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of health care data, said his sense is that at the end of the day, the change ""will hobble the ACA, but not kill it."" ""The heart of the ACA – the premium subsidies, the Medicaid expansion, and protections for pre-existing conditions – remain in place,"" he said. ""The premium subsidies should provide enough of an incentive for many healthy people to get coverage to keep the individual market reasonably stable."" The law provides substantial assistance to keep premiums affordable for people with low incomes (specifically, those making less than 400 percent of federal poverty). Those households represent most of the plans sold through the government’s health insurance exchanges. In 2017, about 8.7 million people benefited. When premiums rise, the subsidies insulate households from most of the impact. Assuming the end of the penalty pushes premiums up, Levitt said the people who will take the hit are those who make over 400 percent of federal poverty (about $98,000 per year for a family of four) and aren’t insulated from increases by the subsidies. That puts about 6.7 million people at risk. That’s a lot of people, even if it’s only about 2 percent of the total population. We reached out to other health care policy experts. Christine Eibner at the RAND Corporation emphasized that the effect of repeal is ""highly uncertain."" Still, she told us that ""on balance, I think the evidence suggests that the mandate is having some impact on enrollment, but it may be small relative to other factors such as the tax credits and subsidies."" ""We don’t really know what the impact will be,"" said Martin Gaynor, economist at Carnegie Mellon University. But he went on to warn that ""if the mandate is important, then eliminating it will create big problems in the exchange marketplaces, which would likely prove difficult to reverse."" Trump said that repealing the individual mandate essentially repealed Obamacare and eliminated a primary source of funding for the program. Eliminating the mandate does undercut the Affordable Care Act, but it hardly repeals it. In reality, the major pieces of the Affordable Care Act remain in place. On the money side, the penalties represent less than 3 percent of the cost of the program, and other taxes directly tied to paying for Obamacare are four and five times larger. Overall, this change will be disruptive, but not terminal. It certainly does not ""essentially repeal"" Obamacare. We rate Trump’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA07BC0>],/factchecks/2017/dec/21/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-says-end-mandate-essentially-obamaca/

Pick them from a bin? Donald Trump mischaracterizes diversity visa lottery
","President Donald Trump's claims about bad people coming into the United States have expanded to include not just people who get here illegally, but also immigrants who arrive legally after being vetted by the U.S. government. Trump told graduates at the FBI National Academy that two recent terrorist attacks in New York City were perpetrated by individuals who came to the United States via a ""dysfunctional immigration system,"" one through family sponsorship and the other through the diversity visa lottery program. Trump said: ""They have a lottery. You pick people. Do you think the country is giving us their best people? No. What kind of a system is that? They come in by lottery. They give us their worst people, they put them in a bin, but in his hand, when he’s picking them is, really, the worst of the worst. Congratulations, you’re going to the United States. Okay. What a system — lottery system."" Trump made similar comments on Dec. 20 at a Cabinet meeting: ""When we take people in a lottery, they're not putting their best people in the lottery. It's common sense. They're not saying, 'Oh, let's take our best people and let's put them into the lottery so that we can send them over to the United States.' No. They put their worst people into the lottery. And that's what we get in many cases."" Trump’s recent comments parallel his Pants on Fire claim as presidential candidate that the Mexican government sends ""the bad ones"" over to the United States. In this case, Trump oversimplified and misconstrued the program. Countries don't send their people. Lottery applicants must meet minimum standards for education or work experience. The lottery is run by the United States, not foreign countries. Lottery winners are selected by a random, computerized process. Individuals must pass background vetting by the U.S. government before getting a visa. The White House declined to comment on the record for this fact-check. Trump favors a merit-based immigration system where people come in based on job skills, not just because of family connections or for diversity purposes. He’s said the visa lottery ""presents significant vulnerabilities to our national security"" and has pointed as an example Sayfullo Saipov, from Uzbekistan, who entered the United States in 2010 through the lottery program. Saipov is accused of killing eight people and injuring a dozen other in an October vehicular attack in New York City. He’s pleaded not guilty to murder and terrorism charges. The visa lottery program was established in 1990 to diversify the United States’ immigrant population. The lottery began in 1995 and selects applicants from countries with low immigration levels during the previous five years. Diversity visas are currently capped at 50,000 per fiscal year. It's not foreign governments who run the lottery, it's administered by the U.S. State Department. Here’s its current description of the program: • Applicants register online for the lottery in the fall; • Names of lottery winners are randomly selected by a computer; • Lottery winners are notified around May that they can apply for the diversity visa; • The visa application process and interviews begin Oct. 1. This step includes extensive vetting such as biographic and biometric screening against U.S. law enforcement and counterterrorism databases; • Applicants who pass the vetting process are awarded the diversity visa, which is usually valid for up to six months from date of issuance. ""No visa can be issued unless all concerns raised by the screening are fully resolved. As part of this screening process, information that might suggest an individual is a potential threat is shared with all appropriate U.S. government agencies,"" the State Department said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""National security is our top priority when adjudicating visa applications,"" the agency added. Trump’s comment that the worst are coming not only ignores vetting done by the State Department, but also lottery entry requirements of at least a high school education or its equivalent, or two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience to perform. ""In countries where only a fraction of people complete secondary school, this basic criterion limits the pool of people eligible for the diversity lottery significantly,"" said Beth Elise Whitaker, an associate professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Trump said countries are not ""giving us"" their best people. But that's a flawed statement. Countries do not ""give"" immigrants, noted Elizabeth F. Cohen, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University. ""Individuals make decisions to apply for any visa, including but not limited to the diversity lottery visa. The decision is a difficult one, as is the process of receiving the visa,"" Cohen said. ""The application and vetting process are also complicated, suggesting that only highly capable and well-prepared individuals will succeed."" Cohen said Trump and his administration have promoted two conflicting goals: They have attacked family reunification immigration policies, but also the diversity lottery, ""which does not rely on family reunification and is far more skills-based than the name suggests."" ""The diversity visa program is a true lottery. There is no way a foreign government can game the lottery to offload the worst of their citizenry,"" Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School wrote in an op-ed for the New York Daily News. Trump said of the diversity visa lottery program, ""they give us their worst people, they put them in a bin,"" and ""the worst of the worst"" are selected.  Trump based his criticism of the lottery program on the fact that the suspect in a New York City terror attack came through the program in 2010. But Trump’s simplistic characterization gives a misleading impression of how the process actually works. First of all, countries don't ""give us"" immigrants. The lottery is administered by the United States, not foreign governments. Lottery entrants must meet educational and work experience requirements, and winners are chosen at random by a computer. Also, winning the lottery does not necessarily mean the person will come to the United States. They must be thoroughly vetted before being awarded a visa.

Pants On Fire for claim of Muslim man’s arrest in Northern California wildfires
","Facebook users recently spotted a suspicious article about the deadly Northern California wildfires, through the social network’s initiative that allows readers to flag fake news. Given the steady flow of misleading and intentionally false claims about the cause of the fires, PolitiFact California decided to fact-check the article, which appears to have been posted Dec. 11, 2017. It’s from the website USA In Front and includes a sensational headline: BREAKING: ILLEGAL MUSLIM FROM IRAN ARRESTED FOR STARTING CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE  The article lists ""a 23-year-old man named Muhammad Islam"" as ""the actual person responsible for the fire,"" citing Fox News as the source of the information. We found the network never reported that. Before we examine the story and what appears to be its clearly false assertion, here’s some background on the destruction of the fires. The wind-driven blazes that started Oct. 8, 2017 are the most deadly series of fires in California’s history. They killed 42 people across Northern California and destroyed more than 8,400 homes, businesses and other buildings. Much of the damage was centered in Napa and Sonoma counties. Our research We started our fact-check by contacting the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, the agency in charge of investigating the cause of the blazes. Cal Fire spokesman Scott McLean said there have been no arrests, contradicting the claim in the article. ""All the major fires that occurred in October are still being investigated. No arrests have been made in reference to the October siege,"" McLean wrote. We reached out to USA In Front for comment but did not hear back. The website lists its owner as USA In Front Inc., though we were unable to find out where it is based. The site appears to allow users to create an account and submit content. It includes articles on news and politics with a right-wing bent with headlines such as ""Poll: Should Barack Obama Lose His Presidential Pension?"" to ""Meet The Most Liberal, Fiscally Irresponsible, and Pro-Death Republican in Texas."" Article’s origin We found the story about the arrest of a Muslim man did not start with USA In Front. In October, the fact-checking website Snopes.com, found this tale originated on a site, FreedomJunkshun, that describes its content as satire. Snopes found ""none of the details are based in fact, and the Fox News report mentioned in the article also does not exist."" But what started on the satirical site didn’t stay there. The story circulated around the web, and was posted word-for-word on sites such as World Today 365 and USA In Front. Those websites presented the story as news without any mention of its satirical origin. When we first examined the article, we noticed a few red flags: It does not have a byline, so there’s no direct way to contact the person that wrote the story. Unlike traditional, credible news articles, the story does not have a date or dateline.   Additionally, the article fails to cite any specific people as sources. This is not the only time USA In Front has been flagged. The national PolitiFact handed out a Pants On Fire earlier this month for the site’s made-up story that Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer had an affair with a teenage cheerleader. PolitiFact maintains a list of more than 300 websites, as of November 2017, where it’s found deliberately false or fake stories. The national website describes it this way: ""This is by no means a complete list of offenders. Nor does it mean every post on these websites is fake. But in most cases, these sites work hard to fool readers, and you should take that into consideration if should you see a link being shared from one.""  Breitbart’s false claim The story posted on USA In Front has some parallels to a claim in a Breitbart article PolitiFact California rated False in October. Breitbart’s article said an undocumented immigrant from Mexico ""was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents."" In reality, an undocumented man had been arrested for an unrelated small fire a week after the deadly blazes started. Sonoma County sheriff’s officials called out Breitbart for fueling the false rumors. State fire authorities said they had not identified an arson suspect nor determined whether arson was the cause of the fires. Breitbart’s article, or versions of it, quickly spread across right-wing media outlets, including InfoWars and the Drudge Report, which shared Breitbart's unsubstantiated claims -- as detailed by BuzzFeed News. After fact-checkers pointed out the false claim, Breitbart added an ""update"" saying the man was not suspected of starting the deadly fires. Our ruling A story recently posted on the website USA In Front claimed a Muslim man had been arrested for starting the deadly Northern California wildfires. The website and others presented the claim as if it were news, though it originated as a false tale on a satirical website. A spokesman for the state’s fire agency, Cal Fire, told us there had been no arrests and that the cause of the fires remains under investigation. The article on USA In Front is another example of the many fabricated claims tied to the deadly blazes. It lacks a byline, any specific sources and any disclaimer about its origin as satire. We didn’t hear back from the website. Posting the story without this key warning is reckless and perpetuates false and damaging information. We rate the claim in the USA In Front article Pants On Fire.  PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. There is no such ban on the word ‘Christmas’ by Mayor-elect Ravi Bhalla. Bhalla, a city council member and lawyer, was elected mayor Nov. 7 out of a field of six candidates. He will be officially sworn in Jan. 1, 2018. The previous mayor, Dawn Zimmer, decided not to run again. Bhalla will be the first Sikh mayor of Hoboken. During the election, a flier with the phrase ""Don't let TERRORISM take over our town"" above a picture of Bhalla appeared on car windshields. The Last Line of Defense article stated that Bhalla received a Christmas gift from Zimmer: a chance to make one mayoral decree at the annual Christmas gala at the Patrick C. Farley Community Center at 5th and Brussels. The two politicians shook hands and then ""Bhalla shocked the roughly 200 citizens in attendance with his decree that ""the word ‘Christmas shall not be said at government functions,'"" the article stated. Apparently that didn’t sit well with one man in the audience, according to the website which used a quote allegedly from the Hoboken Journal. ""The crowd began to boo loudly and one man was escorted out after throwing a souffle at Bhalla’s head, knocking his turban off. Eventually, things returned to normal but there was a sense of displeasure the rest of the evening."" We searched the website of the Hoboken Journal, a blog, and found no such quote.

Hoboken spokesman Juan Melli said that the only truthful part of the article is that Bhalla will become the mayor in January. The photo accompanying the article is of Bhalla and Zimmer in front of City Hall. ""Everything else is garbage,"" Melli told PolitiFact. ""I don’t know how else to put it."" There was no Christmas gala (there was a Christmas tree lighting that was indeed open to the public). Also there is no intersection of 5th and Brussels in Hoboken. And Bhalla isn’t Muslim -- he is a Sikh. Bhalla, a child of Indian immigrants, was born in New Jersey. Melli said that he sent the fake news article to Bhalla and that the mayor-elect laughed.

No, Alabama poll workers were not arrested in U.S. Senate election
","Poll workers in Birmingham, Ala., allowed 3,000 invalid votes to benefit Democrat Doug Jones in his Senate race against Republican Roy Moore, according to a fake news article on Facebook. ""Alabama State Police arrest 3 poll workers in Birmingham"" stated a headline on the American Revolution website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. There is no truth to this article. We saw no disclaimer on the American Revolution website, but the same story was posted on reaganwasright, a website that identifies itself as satire and is a frequent purveyor of fake news. Jones beat Moore in the Alabama U.S. Senate special election Dec. 12. The Washington Post reported in November that Moore, while in his 30s, initiated sexual encounters with several teenagers, according to the women interviewed by the newspaper. There have been multiple fake news reports related to the election. This article on the American Revolution website contained no details explaining the supposedly fraudulent votes and contains some fictional details such as stating that Birmingham is in Applevale County -- it is located in Jefferson County. It stated that the three poll workers  -- Wanda Werkmeister, Olivia Pertuiary and Maureen Brown -- will all face felony charges punishable by up to 10 years in prison and $1 million in fines. The article includes a quote by Fox News host Sean Hannity, but we found no evidence he said this: ""Without that inner-city ghetto vote, Doug Jones doesn’t have a chance. It doesn’t make much sense why someone from the city’s vote is so much more important to Democrats, who swear they aren’t at all racist."" The article stated that Hannity made those comments on Dana Loesch’s show Guns God and Grits. A Fox News spokeswoman told PolitiFact that Hannity did not make the statement and Loesch, who hosts a conservative radio show, told PolitiFact that she hadn’t had Hannity on her show in a few years and doesn’t have a show with that name. The American Revolution website linked to the Facebook page for Special News USA. We sent a message to Special News USA via Facebook and a person replied stating, ""I do not know whether or not the news is correct or not, but I distributed it to get the feedback of other people."" We found no news reports that poll workers were arrested in Birmingham. Robyn Bradley Bryan, Alabama Law Enforcement Agency spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that the agency did not arrest any poll workers. A spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State, John Bennett, told PolitiFact that there were no poll workers with the names in the article. A headline stated ""Alabama state police arrest 3 poll workers in Birmingham."" There is no evidence that such a crime occurred.

No, Trump and Congress didn't pass bill ending child support
","Child support is coming to an end in the United States thanks to President Donald Trump and Congress, at least that's what a fake news story on Facebook would have you believe. ""Law passed: All child support in the United States will end by beginning of 2018,"" stated the headline on tmzbreaking, a website that describes itself as ""the most notorious fauxtire & satire entertainment website in the world."" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The fake article has been circulating at least for a few months on Facebook. The end of the article directs readers to Channel50news, a prank website. The dateline on the story says Sept. 20, 2016, but when we read the oldest comments at the bottom of the story, they started on Sept. 20, 2017. Another hint that this is fake news is that the three-paragraph article has typos or sentences that make no sense: ""President Trump claims he will no longer for any party of parent to pay child support. Trump also says that ant reports of abuse or negligence to a child from either party will result in the child automatically being turned over to the State Child Welfare."" While this fake story suggests that the federal government is wiping out child support, it’s worth noting that states set child support policies and have enforcement programs. We emailed the authors of the website and did not get a reply. A story stated that a law will end all child support in the United States in 2018, but no such law has been passed. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC74C780>],/factchecks/2017/dec/19/tmzbreaking/no-trump-and-congress-didnt-pass-bill-ending-child/

No, the FDA didn't hide information linking vaccine to autism
","The federal government tried to hide that a common vaccine given to children causes autism, according to a misleading viral story on Facebook. ""Now it’s official: FDA announced that vaccines are causing autism,"" stated a headline on truthcommand.com. The story stated: ""For years, fears over vaccines and the onset of autism have been dispelled by medical professionals, but this has all changed. Parents over the years have been criticized for abstaining from getting their child vaccinated over autism fears, but now it turns out they were right all along."" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that the website misled readers about information related to the potential adverse side effects of the DTaP vaccine Tripedia manufactured in the past by Sanofi Pasteur. DTaP, a vaccine given to children in multiple doses, stands for Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, getting those diseases is much riskier than getting the vaccine. Mild problems such as a fever or swelling are common, while severe problems such as a serious allergic reaction are so ""rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine."" The internet has been fueled with misinformation for years about a vaccine-autism link. A 1998 article in a British medical journal, the Lancet, claimed to show a link between the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and autism but in 2010, the Lancet retracted the study. Scientists have repeatedly debunked the myth that vaccines cause autism through peer-reviewed studies. And yet, the spread of misinformation continues -- including by Donald Trump before and during his race for president. Vaccine pamphlet on adverse side effects Truthcommand.com stated that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration admitted that autism is a potential side effect in an online pamphlet about Tripedia: ""Adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting."" But that section also includes a disclaimer about adverse events: ""Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine."" Through the federal government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), anyone can file a report: doctors, patients, family members -- and they don’t need proof that the event was caused by the vaccine. Government researchers examine the reports and turn over anything suspicious to outside groups, such as the Institute of Medicine for more research. Marie McCormick, an expert on child health at the Harvard School of Public Health, told PolitiFact that the reporting system can be gamed. When the measles-thimerosal-autism controversy first emerged, activists encouraged parents to report adverse events regardless of the duration of time since the vaccination and prior events such as previous indications of developmental problems. What happened to the pamphlet on FDA’s website Truthcommand.com suggested that the FDA had tried to hide the autism link by deleting this pamphlet from the FDA’s website. But the FDA told PolitiFact that the pamphlet written by Sanofi Pasteur in 2005 wasn’t actually deleted -- the FDA archived it and sent PolitiFact a link to the pamphlet. It’s no surprise that the pamphlet was archived on the FDA’s website because the vaccine hasn’t been available for many years. Cristine K. Schroeder, a spokeswoman for Sanofi Pasteur, told PolitiFact that the company’s last shipment of Tripedia occurred in 2012. ""Tripedia is not in use today,"" she said. The company’s pamphlets for current vaccines for DTaP, Daptacel, Pentacel and Quadracel, do not list autism as a potential adverse event. They do show data from clinical trials about side effects such as the percentage of children who got a fever, or became drowsy. Tripedia was originally licensed by the FDA in the early 1990s, FDA spokeswoman Megan McSeveney told PolitiFact. The drug maker had to follow what was at the time broad label requirements for adverse events. More recent federal regulations about drug labeling approved in 2006 are now more narrow and state that the only adverse events that have to be reported are those ""for which there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event."" The scientific evidence does not support a link between any vaccine, including Tripedia (DTaP), and autism or other developmental disorders, McSeveney said. The truthcommand.com website states that it aims ""to raise awareness to issues ignored by the media."" We contacted the email address listed on the website and did not get a reply. Part way through our reporting the story was no longer accessible on the website. The misleading story has circulated at least since March 2016 when Snopes debunked it. Truthcommand.com stated ""Now it’s official: FDA announced that vaccines are causing autism."" But the FDA did no such thing. The evidence Truthcommand.com cited is taken out of context, inaccurate or out of date. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.
