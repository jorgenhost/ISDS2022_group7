No, the FDA isn’t requiring all ice cream containers be sealed in response to the Blue Bell licker
","Who would have thought that buying ice cream in a grocery store would be such a gamble? On June 29, a video that quickly went viral on Twitter showed a teen in a Texas Walmart open the lid of a Blue Bell ice cream carton, and then proceed to lick the top layer of ice cream before putting it back on the shelf.  The clip of the unsanitary – and illegal – act spread far and wide, leading to the girl’s arrest, as well as at least one copycat. The copycat, a 36-year-old man from Louisiana, was also identified and is now facing charges.  Now, a Facebook post claims that in the wake of this ice cream crime, the Food and Drug Administration altered its packaging rules and now will require a seal to be placed on all cartons, thus driving up the cost of the product for consumers.  The post says: ""What she set in motion when she licked the Blue Bell Ice Cream. The FDA will now require sealed ice cream cartons. Yes, there will be a plastic skin tight seal on ice cream cartons now. This will increase the cost of ice cream as machines will need to be bought for the plants to seal the cartons and not to mention buying the sealing material and the extra electricity to run the machines. The plastic sealing material will now find its way to already stuffed Landfills thus taxing the garbage system even more. So remember when you see the seal on ice cream and a higher price it was her fault and her fault alone. This is what being a dumbass does to the rest of us who are not dumbasses. HAVE A NICE DAY!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As gross as these ice cream lickers may be, the FDA has not yet made it a requirement that all ice cream companies have sealed cartons.  Peter Cassell, lead press officer for food emergencies and safety at the FDA, told PolitiFact the claim is not accurate.  ""The issue that sparked this rumor is a matter for local law enforcement and the company that makes the ice cream,"" Cassell wrote in an email. Some ice cream companies, such as Haagen Daz for example, already do have sealed containers.  In contrast to the Facebook post’s view of plastic seals being a burden, Blue Bell received quite a bit of flack on social media following the incident, as users questioned why its ice cream containers did not already have protective seals. At first, the company said the production of its half gallons involved them being flipped upside down during which the ice cream freezes to the lid, ""creating a natural seal ... Any attempt at opening the product should be noticeable,"" according to NBC’s Today.com.  But after the second Blue Bell ice cream licker emerged, the company released a statement saying that food safety is its top priority and that they are taking the tampering cases ""very seriously."" ""We are always looking for ways to improve,"" the statement said, ""including looking at methods within our manufacturing process to add additional protection to the carton."" After a viral video showed a teen licking a Blue Bell ice cream tub before returning it to a Texas Walmart shelf, a post on Facebook claims the incident prompted the FDA to now require all ice cream companies add protective seals to their products, thus driving up the cost of ice cream. But the FDA said the rumor is inaccurate and the incident is being handled by local law enforcement and the ice cream company affected. Blue Bell, unlike some other ice cream companies, does not currently have sealed containers but said in a statement it is looking at methods ""to add additions protection to the carton."" We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C496300>],/factchecks/2019/jul/17/facebook-posts/no-fda-isnt-requiring-all-ice-cream-containers-be-/

No, country hip-hop star Lil Nas X was not dropped from Wrangler after coming out as gay
","You may have heard of country hip-hop hybrig musician Lil Nas X who recently gained international fame after his breakout single ""Old Town Road"" was released in late 2018.  Alas, with stardom comes rumors.

George H.W. Bush didn’t say if Americans ever found out ‘what we have done’ they would ‘lynch us’
","A brash, self-incriminating quote attributed every few years to President George H.W. Bush is back in social media rotation. The Facebook post says Bush revealed to a news reporter in the early ’90s that if the American public ever found out what ""we have done"" they would ""lynch us."" The post features a photo of the 41st president with the following words:  ""‘If the American People ever find out what we have done, they will chase us down the street and lynch us’ - H.W. Bush June 1992 to Sarah McClendon (White House Press Corps)"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Looking into the claim, it appears that the alleged quote arose out of Bush’s decision to pardon six former officials of President Ronald Reagan’s administration who were implicated in the Iran-Contra Affair. That’s because one of the oldest iterations of the quote can be found in a regurgitated Q&A cited as being from a July 10, 1995, interview on a conservative radio program: ""[The following interview with Lt. Commander Alexander Martin (retired) took place on Tom Valentine's Radio Free America program on July 10, 1995. Valentine's comments follow ‘Q’ while Martin's follow ‘A’.] Q: I don't see how it would have been possible. A: It would not have been possible, and it was not possible at the time to do so. I think George Bush said it very well in an interview with Sarah McClendon, the grand dame of the Washington press corps. When Bush consented to an interview with Mrs. McClendon in June of 1992, he said on record, which she printed in her newsletter that month, when she asked him about Iran-contra and he said, (and I'm quoting from her newsletter): ""If the people were to ever find out what we have done, we would be chased down the streets and lynched."" This was a public comment by George Bush. Q: George Bush actually admitted that? A: He said it and it was printed in Mrs. McClendon's newsletter in June of 1992."" Sarah McClendon covered the White House for over 50 years and in that time most notably ran her one-woman McClendon News Service under which she released the newsletter, ""Sarah McClendon’s Washington Report.""  But in a review of McClendon’s June 1992 newsletters, nothing close to the quote that Martin attributed to her could be found. So, let us enumerate this claim's flaws: First, it is unlikely that Bush, who publicly and vehemently denied any involvement in the scandal (which unfolded while he served as vice president), would say such a self-incriminating statement, especially to a journalist. Second, we could find no mention of such a quote in archives of McClendon’s papers. Third, if the president made such an inflammatory and self-incriminating statement to the press about a high-profile scandal (especially while it was under heightened attention), it would have been picked up and republished by media outlets across the country. But a search for the quote through Nexis news archives also came up short.

Viral meme on cancer and acidity connection gets a lot wrong
","Do pH levels and cancer have a connection? The popular assertion can be found all over the internet, and one particular Facebook post shares an unattributed quote that makes the bold claim that ""every"" person with cancer has a pH that is ""too acidic."" It then goes on to say that the late Dr. Otto Warburg, a renowned cancer researcher, won the Nobel Prize for proving that acidity-cancer relationship. The post begins with the quote: ""Every single person who has cancer has a pH that is too acidic,"" and then goes on to say that Warburg ""won the Nobel Prize in 1931 for proving that cancer can’t survive in an alkaline oxygen rich environment but thrives in an acidic, low oxygen environment."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s cut to the chase: This isn’t accurate. Dr. Otto Warburg did, indeed, win the Nobel Prize in 1931, but not for proving that cancer and pH levels are related. And cancer does, indeed, thrive in an acidic environment – but it’s not that cut and dried.  According to the Nobel Prize website, Warburg was awarded the prize for his discovery of the ""nature and mode of action of the respiratory enzyme."" A discovery, the website says, that ""opened up new ways in the fields of cellular metabolism and cellular respiration. He has shown, among other things, that cancerous cells can live and develop, even in the absence of oxygen."" Warburg’s research eventually found that cancerous cells helped produce the low-oxygen, high-acidic conditions – not that they were necessarily created out of such an environment.  That pivotal discovery, now termed the ""Warburg Effect,"" is the observation that cancer consumes glucose and excretes lactate. A 2016 medical report on the Warburg Effect explains the process: ""When oxygen is present, normal cells use mitochondria to oxidise glucose, but in the absence of oxygen, glucose is converted into lactate. Otto Warburg first described in the 1920s that cancer cells utilised higher levels of glucose in the presence of oxygen with an associated increase in lactate production."" Another 2016 review, found in the Trends in Biochemical Sciences journal, says that the Warburg Effect is better identified as part of cancer’s progression and not the initial onset of the disease: ""It is likely that the Warburg Effect provides an overall benefit that supports a tumor microenvironment conducive to cancer cell proliferation. However, the Warburg Effect is thought to be an early event in oncogenesis that is an immediate consequence of an initial oncogenic mutation."" So, the meme gets it a little twisted – while Warburg found that cancer cells certainly survived and grew in acidic environments, they also helped create those environments. ""All of this basically means that malignant tumors tend to be low in oxygen and that cancerous cells, more than normal cells, metabolize sugars in a way that does not rely on oxygen, which in turn produces an acidic micro-environment,"" Ted Gansler, strategic director of pathology research at the American Cancer Society, told PolitiFact.  ""This does not mean that a cancer patient’s entire body is acidic, only the tumor is. Also, growth and metabolism of the tumor causes low oxygen levels and an acidic environment locally, but this definitely does not mean that an acidic environment or low oxygen level caused the cancer or that eating an alkaline diet or breathing air with higher levels of oxygen can effectively treat the cancer."" It’s also worth noting that the claim doesn’t define what it means by ""too acidic."" According to health information website Healthline, the pH value varies from 0 to 14, with ""acidic"" ranging from 0 to 6.9, ""neutral"" at 7.0 and ""alkaline"" between 7.1 and 14. The pH levels in the human body also vary. For example, the stomach is highly acidic to aid in digestion, while blood is slightly alkaline. Even more importantly, while diet can alter the pH levels of urine, it does not significantly affect the pH of a person’s blood. Drawing from several studies found in the U.S. National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health, the Healthline report points out the main reasons why this acidity and cancer connection is flawed: ""Firstly, food doesn’t significantly influence blood pH. Second, even if you assume that food could dramatically alter the pH value of blood or other tissues, cancer cells are not restricted to acidic environments. In fact, cancer grows in normal body tissue, which has a slightly alkaline pH of 7.4. Many experiments have successfully grown cancer cells in an alkaline environment. And while tumors grow faster in acidic environments, the tumors create this acidity themselves. It is not the acidic environment that creates the cancer, but the cancer that creates the acidic environment."" ""(An alkaline) dietary pattern is effective because it provides beneficial nutrients, avoids harmful substances that can cause cancer, and avoids excess calories that can lead to obesity, which is itself a risk factor for cancer, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes"" Gansler said. ""The benefit of these foods has nothing whatsoever to do with their pH (the way scientists describe alkalinity and acidity). In fact, the pH of blood and tissues remains remarkably constant and is not influenced by diet. To be blunt, the rationale behind an alkaline diet is ‘pseudoscience.’"" Maria Petzel, a senior clinical dietitian at MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, explains in a Q&A on the center’s website that the alkaline diet is based on a theory that eating certain foods can change the body’s pH levels: ""Some believe that changing the body’s pH levels can improve your health and help you lose weight or even prevent cancer. But there’s no way the foods you eat can alter the pH level of your blood,"" Petzel says in the Q&A. ""The body’s pH is a very tightly regulated system. If you change your diet, you may see changes in the pH of your saliva or urine because these are waste products, but there’s no way you could ever eat enough that it really impacts your blood."" A claim recently posted on Facebook says ""every single person who has cancer has a pH that is too acidic"" and that Dr. Warburg’s research proved cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment. The human body’s pH varies, so it is not possible for a person to simply have a universal pH that is ""too acidic."" And while it is correct that cancer thrives better in acidic conditions versus alkaline, cancerous cells are known to help produce the acidic environment themselves. We rate this claim False. Correction: Dr. Otto Warburg won the Nobel Prize in 1931, not the Nobel Peace Prize. This story has been updated.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BFCD00>],/factchecks/2019/jul/17/facebook-posts/viral-meme-cancer-and-acidity-connection-gets-lot-/

Undocumented immigrants aren’t free to leave detention centers at any time, but they can request it
","Border patrol facilities holding immigrants are under scrutiny over reports of overcrowding and unsanitary conditions, and claims about the situation saturate social media. One recent claim in a text post has amassed tens of thousands of shares on Facebook. It says illegal immigrants have the ability to leave detention centers ""any time"" they want. It reads: ""No one mentions that illegals are free to leave detention centers anytime to go back to Mexico. They aren't our prisoners."" The July 6 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found many iterations of the claim on Facebook, most using the exact same wording. But here’s the thing: The system that places migrants in detention doesn’t quite work as simply as this claim suggests. Voluntary departure is possible — but not automatic — for migrants who are being held at detention centers. But simply leaving ""any time"" they want is not an option, immigration experts told us. ""Some unauthorized immigrants in detention are eligible to apply for ‘voluntary departure’ during a removal hearing,"" David FitzGerald, co-director at the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, told PolitiFact.  He continued: ""An immigration judge has to approve the application. Eligibility for voluntary departure is restricted to those who do not have an aggravated felony conviction, have been in the U.S. at least a year, and are deemed by the court to be of ‘good moral character.’ If the application is granted, the immigrant is then repatriated. The judge sets a deadline of up to 60 days for the immigrant to leave the U.S., and may require a bond to be posted. There are harsh legal consequences for staying in the U.S. past the deadline."" Theresa Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington D.C., said the Facebook claim is ""not accurate."" ""If you are in detention, you just can’t leave the center,"" Brown said. ""If they are in government custody they are not free to leave. They are detained, they can’t just walk out. And if somebody arrives at a port of entry to legally seek entry to the U.S. and is told they are inadmissible, they can request to withdraw their application for admission and return. But it is not their absolute right; it is the government’s discretion … at that point in time, they can say, ‘I just want to go home,’ but the government does not need to grant that request."" Also, because it’s easier for a migrant to re-enter the United States after they leave under the terms of a voluntary departure, the government may prefer to deny the request, Brown said. ""The government can say ‘no, we don’t think this person is really going to leave ... so we are going to process them for removal,’"" Brown said. ""The fundamental legal point is that no one who is subject to U.S. immigration or is in a position where they have been apprehended can leave on their own without the government saying ‘yes you can’ and that includes at a port of entry or not."" The situation in detention centers is more complicated than these posts suggest. ""Under the zero tolerance border enforcement policies, migrants who are apprehended or turn themselves in face criminal prosecution for illegal entry. As such, they cannot just go back into Mexico,"" wrote Susan Martin, emeritus professor at the Institute for the Study of International Migration at Georgetown University, in an email. ""In fact, the prosecutions are designed to prevent return without consequences to the migrant, particularly if it means the migrants get another opportunity to try to cross the border illegally.""  Martin explained that many detained migrants are not actually from Mexico, and do not have the right to go back to Mexico unless the country accepts them. Getting back to other countries is also complicated and problematic, she said, and some simply refuse to accept their nationals back. We recently fact-checked a similar statement about migrant children made by U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, a Republican from Texas. After visiting a shelter in a restored Walmart, Burgess said that undocumented children ""are free to leave"" shelters any time they want. We rated that statement Half True.  Shelters are not detention centers, so their staff can’t forcibly restrain children if they walk out. But if a child were to leave, the process demands that staff members call law enforcement and the child be returned to the facility. Viral Facebook posts say that migrants being held at detention centers ""are free to leave detention centers anytime to go back to Mexico. They aren't our prisoners."" This is a flawed argument — migrants being held in government custody are not simply free to leave.  Undocumented immigrants living in the United States, as well as those being held in detention centers, can request voluntary departure. But the U.S. government has discretion over whether those requests are granted. The statement contains an element of truth but oversimplifies migrants’ abilities to leave detention centers and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096CF2580>],/factchecks/2019/jul/17/facebook-posts/undocumented-immigrants-arent-free-leave-detention/

Donald Trump claimed Twitter has made it harder for people to follow him. That’s false
","President Donald Trump’s recent social media summit included about 200 of his closest internet supporters talking about the alleged anti-conservative bias of major technology platforms. The July 11 meeting at The White House featured pro-Trump meme creators, such as Carpe Donktum, and conservative organizations like the Heritage Foundation. Neither Facebook nor Twitter were invited, although the president announced a separate meeting with the platforms in the coming weeks. During the summit, Trump said Twitter had somehow made it harder for people to follow him.  ""I know that we’ve been blocked,"" he said. ""People come up to me and they say, ‘Sir, I can’t get you — I can’t follow you. They make it impossible.’"" We wondered if Trump’s claim about his Twitter followers, which number around 62 million — a growth of about 40 million from his inauguration day — had some merit. So we looked into it. PolitiFact reached out to both the White House and Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign for evidence to back up the president’s comments at the social media summit. The campaign did not provide a comment and we haven’t heard back from the White House. We’ll update this story if we do. In a literal sense, Trump hasn’t been ""blocked,"" in his words, or otherwise banned on Twitter.  When we searched the word ""Trump"" on both Twitter and Google, the president’s profile was the first to appear. We were able to unfollow and refollow him with two clicks of a button. We couldn’t find any news coverage or statements from Twitter saying that Trump had been blocked or otherwise restricted on the platform, and Twitter did not provide a comment for this story. Fact-checkers at CNN debunked the president’s claim, saying there’s ""no evidence that Twitter or other social media companies have made it difficult for people to follow Trump."" Before he made the claim about being blocked on Twitter, Trump talked about how the growth of his followers had seemed to stagnate in recent months. ""It’s so different than it was even six, seven months ago. I was picking up unbelievable amounts of people,"" he said. ""A number of months ago, I was at a certain number — many millions. And then all of a sudden, I was down over a million."" There is an explanation for this: Trump has lost followers over the past year due to Twitter’s purge of fake accounts. The New York Times reported in July 2018 that Trump lost a little more than 300,000 followers in one purge, while former President Barack Obama lost more than 2 million. That same month, PolitiFact wrote about Twitter allegedly ""shadow banning,"" or decreasing the reach of, conservative politicians in favor of Democratic ones. We found that those claims were based on a software error on the platform that made it harder to find certain handles through search, which the company said it fixed. In October, Trump criticized Twitter’s decision to remove fake accounts and for allegedly doing something ""that makes it much harder to join."" The company defended its policies, saying that ""many prominent accounts have seen follower counts drop, but the result is higher confidence that the followers they have are real, engaged people."" Conservatives have long accused companies like Google and Facebook of burying or censoring their content. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told CNN last year that his employees’ bias ""is more left-leaning."" But as The Guardian pointed out in December, accusations of systemic bias stem from the fact that tech companies typically keep their content moderation strategies under wraps. Further, some conservative-leaning publishers have found success on social media. A recent analysis from Newswhip, a social media analytics firm, found that Fox News and The Daily Wire were among the publishers with the most engagement on Facebook in June 2019. Many public figures on the right, from politicians like Trump and commentators like Ben Shapiro, enjoy large followings on platforms like Twitter and Instagram.  Trump claimed that people have ""been blocked"" from following him on Twitter. We were able to search for, find and follow the president’s profile in a matter of seconds. The White House did not provide any evidence for his claim. We found no evidence that suggested Twitter made it harder to follow him. A recent purge of fake accounts reduced Trump’s Twitter followers, but it also reduced those of former President Barack Obama.   Trump’s claim is not accurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097043180>],/factchecks/2019/jul/17/donald-trump/trump-claimed-twitter-has-made-it-harder-people-fo/

President Trump correct about food stamp low
","Participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps, has been declining for the past several years largely due to an improving economy. President Donald Trump referred to the decline in a July 9 tweet, mentioning a right-wing media outlet that published an article about the 10-year low hours before. ""Food Stamp participation hits 10 year low. Wow! @OANN,"" Trump wrote. The White House and Trump campaign did not provide a comment. SNAP benefits are food vouchers issued by the government to eligible participants and families with no or low income. While the federal government oversees the program, benefits are administered monthly on the state level.  When it comes to comparing SNAP participation over the past 10 years, the best way to do so is to examine the percentage of the U.S. population that is participating in the program, said Lauren Bauer, fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. It’s preferable to take the percentage of the population instead of a regular count because the U.S. population is growing. She pointed us to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Since April 2009, the only month that had a lower participation percentage was February 2019. As we’ll see, there were unusual circumstances — a government shutdown — that affected the February numbers.      The general decline in SNAP benefits is likely due to ""the consequences of the very low level of unemployment and gradually rising wages,"" said Michael Wiseman, professor of public policy at George Washington University. Due to a government shutdown, February 2019 had the lowest participation percentage — only 2.22% of people received SNAP benefits. As the record-breaking shutdown lasted from Dec. 22, 2018, to Jan. 25, 2019, most February benefits were distributed in January ""to ensure SNAP recipients would receive their February 2019 benefits in a timely manner,"" according to the USDA. The number of SNAP participants largely depends on the economy, said Brynne Keith-Jennings, senior research analyst of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. And experts noted that policy changes haven’t had significant long-term effects on the decline in participation — that’s how strongly tied SNAP is to the economy. Because of the Great Recession, SNAP benefits were expanded at the beginning of the Obama administration in 2009 as a counter-recession effort, Wiseman said. The expansion was eliminated in 2013, so the 2009 Recovery Act had short-term if any effects, Keith-Jennings added. Another part of the 2009 stimulus was suspending a three-month limit to SNAP participation for Able-Bodied Adults without Dependents. States with high unemployment rates have the ability to waive the limit, at least for now. ""The Trump administration has proposed tightening standards for permitting relief from time limits,"" Wiseman said. ""In my judgment, time limits on (Able-Bodied Adults without Dependents), while questionable policy, are not the driving factor behind slowdown of SNAP enrollment."" A proposal by the U.S. Department of Agriculture would make it more difficult for states to waive the three-month limit.  If the USDA rule is approved, an estimated 755,000 people would no longer be eligible for SNAP benefits, according to a USDA estimate that’s part of the proposed rule. However, even if it’s approved, the economy would still have a larger effect on overall trends in SNAP participation due to the relatively small size of this population among SNAP participants, Keith-Jennings said. Our ruling Trump tweeted, ""Food Stamp participation hits 10 year low."" He’s correct. The abnormally low SNAP participation in February 2019 was due to benefits for that month being distributed in January 2019 because of a government shutdown.

San Francisco isn’t spending $72.5 million to clean up ‘human waste and drug paraphernalia’
","A viral photo on Facebook takes two San Francisco statistics out of context to make a point about government spending. In a post published July 1, Turning Point USA claimed that ""San Francisco has spent $72.5 million this fiscal year cleaning up human waste and drug paraphernalia."" It also claimed that there are ""more drug users on their public needle program than high school graduates."" ""Leftism has destroyed San Francisco,"" the meme reads. ""This is the left’s vision for America."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Turning Point USA is a nonprofit founded by conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The organization has published images making fun of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and former First Lady Michelle Obama in the past, some of which we have fact-checked. The group's claims about San Francisco amassed more than 20,000 likes, shares and comments on Facebook, so we wanted to know if they are accurate. First, PolitiFact reached out to Turning Point USA to ask for evidence supporting their claims. In an email, the organization sent us links to two San Francisco Chronicle articles from 2019. In the first article, which was published May 1, columnist Phil Matier wrote that the city spent ""a record-breaking $72.5 million"" on street cleaning in the 2018-19 fiscal year, an increase of $32 million over the past five years. He also wrote that ""reports of excrement — from both man and beast — on San Francisco’s sidewalks continue to rise."" But that doesn’t mean $72.5 million was spent cleaning up human waste or drug refuse alone, as Turning Point USA claimed. ""The number is roughly the department’s entire annual street cleaning budget, for everything from mechanical street cleaning, to encampment cleanups, to steam cleaning garbage cans, to sweeping up litter in neighborhood commercial corridors and much more,"" said Rachel Gordon, director of policy and communications for the San Francisco Public Works Department, in an email to PolitiFact. Gordon noted that $72 million is a working figure for how much the department will spend on street cleaning this year, as the department is still trying to account for street cleaning that’s done for other city departments. There is no available estimate for feces and drug-related cleaning alone, Gordon said. In its Facebook meme, Turning Point USA claimed ""there are more drug users on their public needle program than high school graduates"" in San Francisco. But that’s not quite right. The group sent over a second San Francisco Chronicle article about the city’s needle exchange program. In the Jan. 30 article, Matier wrote that ""San Francisco has more drug addicts than it has students enrolled in its public high schools."" As proof, he linked to a fact sheet from the San Francisco Unified School District. According to the data, there were 15,861 students enrolled in grades nine through 12 in SFUSD schools in 2018. In his article, Matier reported that there were 24,500 ""injection drug users"" in San Francisco.  That’s based on estimates from the city’s health department, which did not provide PolitiFact with its survey results in time for this publication. But we found a similar number (24,492 injection drug users) in a 2018 study about hepatitis C in San Francisco. If Turning Point USA had claimed there were more drug users than high school students in San Francisco, it’d be correct. But it didn’t — the nonprofit claimed there are more drug users ""on their needle exchange program"" than high school graduates. And that’s false. In an email to PolitiFact, Rachael Kagan, director of communications for the San Francisco Department of Public Health, said that there is no such thing as a count of drug users on a ""public needle program.""  The program that Turning Point USA’s photo alludes to is an initiative housed in the Department of Public Health. Since 1993, the city has provided access to clean syringes in an effort to limit the spread of HIV and hepatitis C. It also works with local nonprofits like the San Francisco AIDS Foundation to pick up used needles left on the streets. ""The sentence makes no sense,"" Kagan said of the Facebook post. Turning Point USA claimed that San Francisco has spent $72.5 million this fiscal year ""cleaning up human waste and drug paraphernalia"" and that ""there are more drug users on their public needle program than high school graduates."" Those claims are based on two San Francisco Chronicle articles — but Turning Point USA’s post misconstrues both the stories and the data backing them up. The Public Works Department said the $72.5 million figure is closer to its entire annual street cleaning budget and that it doesn’t keep track of how much money is spent for specific types of cleaning. The Public Health Department said there is no count of people who use its ""public needle program."" The statements are inaccurate.

No, Obama didn’t give the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Cosby, Weiner and Weinstein
","When news broke that financier Jeffrey Epstein had been arrested on sex trafficking charges, political rumors immediately started circulating on online. Federal prosecutors allege that Epstein coordinated a sex trafficking scheme by paying teenage girls to engage in sex acts. News outlets and social media users were quick to point out his affiliation with the Democratic Party and his connections to politicians, including President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton. While there is little evidence to suggest that such figures knew about Epstein’s alleged crimes, Facebook users and pages are capitalizing on the link between Epstein and Democrats to post inflammatory claims that link the party to sexual misconduct. One such post includes a meme with photos that claim to show former President Barack Obama awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to four men: Clinton, actor Bill Cosby, former congressman Anthony Weiner and former film producer Harvey Weinstein. All four have been either accused of or charged with sexual assault or misconduct in the past. ""I didn’t know there was a sexual predator award… thanks Democrats,"" the post reads. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Several comments suggested people thought the page was real, and the meme has racked up thousands of likes, shares and comments. So we wanted to see if the photo was authentic. Turns out, all but one of the images included in the meme are bogus. A reverse image search for the entire meme brought us to a Snopes fact check from October 2017. Fact-checker Dan Evon reported that the photo of Obama awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Clinton is authentic — Clinton was awarded the honor in November 2013. But the photos of him purportedly giving the prize to the other three men are fake. For starters, only Cosby is included on the Senate’s official list of people who have won the Presidential Medal of Freedom. A reverse image search for the photo of Weinstein brought us to a HuffPost gallery with a photo of former Vice President Joe Biden receiving the medal from Obama in January. As Snopes first reported, it looks likes someone superimposed Weinstein’s face over Biden’s to make it look like the former man had won the award instead of the latter. A reverse image search for the photo of Weiner brought us to a France 24 story with a video thumbnail of Tom Hanks receiving the medal from Obama in November 2016. It looks like the Weiner image was created based on the photo of Hanks. No surprise, the photo of Cosby purportedly getting a Presidential Medal of Freedom is fake too — but not for the reasons you’d expect. A reverse image search for the image of Cosby from the meme took us to a Mic story about Bruce Springsteen giving a concert at the White House. The article includes a photo of Springsteen receiving the award in November 2016 which, again, appears to be the base for the bogus Cosby image. But Cosby has received the Presidential Medal of Freedom before. George W. Bush gave it to him on July 9, 2002, according to the Senate’s list of winners. Our ruling A Facebook meme claims to show Obama awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Bill Clinton, Bill Cosby, Anthony Weiner and Harvey Weinstein. The Senate has only listed Clinton and Cosby as official winners of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Reverse image searches on all the photos included in the meme reveal that all but the image of Clinton are doctored. Other fact-checkers have debunked this meme before.

Donald Trump twists Ilhan Omar’s comments about al-Qaida
","President Donald Trump drew wide criticism July 14 for a tweet that told "" ‘progressive’ Democrat congresswomen"" to ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.""  Some commentators said Trump’s tweet was racist. It was also based on a false premise. Three of the members of Congress he apparently targeted — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts — were born in the United States. The fourth, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, is a naturalized citizen who came to the United States as a refugee from Somalia. The following day, Trump fought back against the criticism at a White House event, going on offense against the four lawmakers, especially Omar. ""I hear the way she talks about al-Qaida,"" Trump said. ""Al-Qaida has killed many Americans. She said you could hold your chest out. ‘When I think of America, ehh. When I think of al-Qaida, I can hold my chest out."" Trump continued, ""When I hear people speaking about how wonderful al-Qaida is, when I hear people talking about ‘some people,’ with the World Trade Center — some people? No, not some people. Much more than some people."" The Trump re-election campaign referred PolitiFact to the following remarks Omar has made in the past. However, Trump was misportraying the substance of what she said. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., outside the Capitol on June 24, 2019. (AP) Pro-Trump circles have given substantial attention to an interview Omar gave in October 2013 for a local PBS show, ""Belahdan,"" which covers Middle Eastern community issues and perspectives. Fox News commentators mentioned the interview this year in February, April and July. On the show, Omar was asked by interviewer Ahmed Tharwat about backlash faced by Somalis following the bombing of a Kenyan shopping mall. Al-Shabab, a terrorist group with ties to al-Qaida, claimed responsibility for the bombing that left 67 people dead.  Omar criticized Al-Shabab for terrorizing communities, but she questioned why Somalis are expected to condemn an attack that they were not a part of. She also discussed with her interviewer a linguistic reason why Islamic terrorist groups seem especially scary to Americans — that the groups’ names, which often come from everyday Arabic words, seem foreign to the ears of English-speakers. At minute 16:49, Omar described an example of this phenomenon when she took a college class studying the ideology of terrorism. ""The thing that was interesting in the class was every time the professor said ‘al-Qaida,’ he sort of like — his shoulders went up,"" she said while laughing. ""‘Al-Qaida!’ ‘Hezbollah!’"" By contrast, she said, ""you don’t say ‘America’ with an intensity, you don’t say ‘England’ with the intensity. You don’t say ‘the Army’ with an intensity. But you say these names (of terrorist groups) because you want that word to carry weight. ... When you hear people speaking in Arabic, you know, suspicion arises, people start to pay attention."" At a press conference on July 15, Omar was asked to respond to Trump’s charge. She said she would not dignify it with a response, saying it was long past time for Muslims to answer for every Islamic terrorist attack, any more than every white American needs to condemn each attack by a white perpetrator. The other potentially relevant remarks Omar has made in the past came during a March 23, 2019, address to the Council of American-Islamic Relations of Greater Los Angeles' fourth annual Valley Banquet in Woodland Hills, Calif. Omar’s remarks drew criticism from some quarters that she had soft-pedaled the 9/11 attacks carried out by al-Qaida. At one point in her remarks, Omar said that ""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,"" according to the YouTube video of the event. She was wrong about CAIR’s founding — the group was actually established in 1994 — but her critics focused on her use of the phrase ""some people did something,"" which they suggested was a way for her to protect al-Qaida.  Others believed Omar was using verbal shorthand and that her meaning was clear from the full speech.  Elsewhere in the speech, she said that "" what we know, and what Islam teaches us, and what I always say, is that love trumps hate."" She also said, ""Regardless of how hard Washington might get for me, or your neighborhoods might get for you, you have to always remember that we have a mission as humans to love one another, to care for our neighbors, to raise compassionate children, and to fully, every single day, show up and make sure that we are furthering justice."" We found another instance in which some have said Omar’s actions were soft on terrorism more generally. In 2016, before she was serving in Congress, Omar wrote a letter to a federal court judge seeking compassion for a defendant in an ISIS conspiracy case. The case involved nine Minnesotans of Somali descent who had traveled to the Middle East to fight for the Islamic State. Although her letter didn’t mention any of the defendants by name, it was entered in the case involving one of them, Abdirahman Daud.  Omar argued that it was better to rehabilitate the defendant rather than imprisoning him for decades. ""As you undoubtedly deliberate with great caution the sentencing of nine recently convicted Somali-American men, I bring to your attention the ramifications of sentencing young men who made a consequential mistake to decades in federal prison,"" she wrote, adding that ""such punitive measures not only lack efficacy, they inevitably create an environment in which extremism can flourish, aligning with the presupposition of terrorist recruitment."" Here, too, however, Omar did not celebrate ISIS but rather described the defendant’s association with the terrorist group a ""consequential mistake."" Ultimately, the judge sentenced Daud to 30 years in prison. Trump said Omar was ""speaking about how wonderful al-Qaida is."" Some have been offended by Omar’s remarks in the 2013 interview and portions of her speech to CAIR. But in neither case did she enthuse about ""how wonderful"" the terrorist group is, or anything close. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A294B00>],/factchecks/2019/jul/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-twists-ilhan-omar-comments/

Trump claims he won Wisconsin early in the evening in 2016. Not so much.
","Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referenced the Fox News call time in Eastern Time. Fox called Wisconsin for Trump at 10:30 p.m. Central Time. This does not affect the rating of this claim. Wisconsin was front and center on the national stage on Election Day 2016. More exactly, on election night. A key swing state, Wisconsin was a focal point for many networks as they tracked Donald Trump’s journey to an unexpected victory. So it was surprising to hear Trump’s reference to that timeline in his most recent visit to our battleground state. ""I'm thrilled to be back in your great state — a state that I won,"" Trump said July 12, 2019, during a speech at Derco Aerospace where he touted the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. ""And we won it not so late in the evening — a little bit early in the evening, actually, which is even better."" Let’s turn back the clock and see how well Trump’s account matches reality. Any kind of ""early"" call for Wisconsin is tricky from the start given the number of states that are on Eastern Time.  In that election, 27 states — more than half — had polls close before Wisconsin’s did at 8 p.m. Central Time, according to MSNBC. Another 14 states closed at the same time as Wisconsin, and many of those did have relatively early calls.  The Associated Press — which has projected races since 1848 and is relied upon in this role by news organizations throughout the country — declared a winner in nine of those 14 states within two hours of the polls closing. The AP didn’t call Wisconsin until hours later. That’s not surprising given the final margin here was just over 22,748 votes, with Trump topping Democrat Hillary Clinton 47.2% to 46.5%, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. The AP called the state for Trump at 1:29 a.m., releasing a bulletin at the same time saying Trump had exceeded 270 electoral votes and been elected president. CNN had called Wisconsin one minute earlier, though at the time their projections still had Trump 13 electoral votes short of the presidency. The outlier for Wisconsin projections was Fox News, which called the race for Trump at 10:30 p.m. on Election Day, some three-and-a-half hours after the polls closed. The other networks didn’t follow suit. Even if you used 10:30 p.m. benchmark, Wisconsin was not among the ""early"" states. At that point, the AP had already projected winners in 38 other states and the District of Columbia. Trump said he won Wisconsin ""a little bit early in the evening"" in 2016. Fox News did project a Trump victory here by 10:30 p.m., but it was an outlier. The AP and CNN didn’t call Wisconsin for Trump until about 1:30 a.m. And calling the Fox News projection ""early"" is a stretch anyhow, since about 80% of states had been called by that point.

Limbaugh wrongly blames Obama for no census citizenship question
","A day after President Donald Trump called off his bid to add a question to the 2020 census asking about U.S. citizenship status, radio host Rush Limbaugh slammed Democrats for opposing the question. ""The real controversy here is, who took the citizenship question off of the census, and why?"" Limbaugh said during an appearance on ""Fox & Friends."" ""It would seem to me that this kind of attention should have been asked when somebody in the Obama regime decided to get rid of it."" Limbaugh had his facts twisted, however, as the citizenship question did not disappear entirely under former President Barack Obama.  That’s what our state partners at PolitiFact North Carolina determined when they checked a similar claim from Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., in April.  Some things have changed since then. The Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration’s stated reason for including a citizenship question in June.  On July 11, Trump ordered all federal agencies to hand over to the Commerce Department any information on the number of non-citizens in the United States. What hasn’t changed is the history of the census citizenship question.  The census has been conducted every decade since 1790 to get a national population count used to determine the distribution of seats in Congress.  A citizenship question first showed up in the census in 1820, and again in 1830, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  In 1870, the question was asked of males ages 21 and older, and it has appeared in some form as a question for all respondents every decade since 1890, with the exception of 1960. But the last time the Census Bureau asked every household about citizenship was in 1950, when census workers knocking on doors wrote down where each person was born and asked as a follow-up, ""If foreign born — is he naturalized?"" That’s significant because had its efforts not been thwarted by the Supreme Court, the Trump administration’s proposal would have asked the citizenship question of all American households. After 1950, the 1960 census inquired about place of birth but not about citizenship.  Then, beginning in 1970, the Census Bureau began distributing two different questionnaires: A short form sent to most households and a long form sent only to about 1 in 6 households. Importantly, only the long form asked about citizenship, meaning just a sample of households actually saw a citizenship question each time the census went out between 1970 through 2000. The 2010 census was the first census administered under Obama’s watch, and it ditched the long form, using only a 10-question short-form questionnaire that did not ask about citizenship. But that doesn’t mean the citizenship question was eliminated by the Obama administration. By 2010, the Census Bureau was already asking about citizenship through its American Community Survey, an annual survey launched in 2005 that goes out to about 3.5 million households every year as a means of collecting demographic and socioeconomic information on an ongoing basis. Limbaugh’s claim that ""somebody in the Obama regime decided to get rid of it"" is misleading, since Obama’s Census Bureau asked about citizenship via the ACS, which effectively replaced the long-form census as the survey sent to a sample of households.  For the record, the ACS has asked a citizenship question every year since 2010, as well. Limbaugh said ""somebody in the Obama regime decided to get rid of"" the citizenship question. A citizenship question hasn’t been asked of all U.S. households since 1950. Between 1970 and 2000, the question was limited to the long-form census questionnaire, which went out to only 1 in 6 households.  In 2010, the Obama administration ended the entire long-form version. The Census Bureau had already begun sending the question, since 2005, to about 3.5 million households by way of the American Community Survey. The statement is not accurate.

Brendan Doherty says most of the David Cicilline campaign is funded by big political action committees
","
Because candidates need money to pay staff and buy the advertisements designed to sway voters, it's not surprising that the source of those funds can be a matter of contention.

Brendan Doherty, the Republican seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, issued a news release Sept. 26 claiming that Cicilline is getting most of his money from large political action committees, not the individual donors that mark a grass-roots campaign.

Here's the statement: ""The Doherty Campaign, unlike the Cicilline Campaign, is funded mostly by individual donors -- not the big PACs that Cicilline relies on.""

To us, ""mostly"" means Cicilline is getting the majority -- more than half -- of his campaign funds from PACs. Because incumbents wield a lot of influence, especially members of Congress, it wouldn't be surprising if Cicilline was getting a lot of money from PACs, many of which are created by groups with specific agendas, such as businesses and labor unions.  But we decided to check.

Our quick go-to source for campaign finance information is OpenSecrets.org, the nonpartisan  nonprofit website of the Center for Responsive Politics.

Its latest tally for the Cicilline-Doherty race shows that as of Aug. 22, 2012, Cicilline had received $413,806 in PAC contributions versus $109,250 in PAC money raised by Doherty.

That represents 24 percent of the money raised by Cicilline and 10 percent raised by Doherty.

That's not a majority for either campaign.

In fact, most of Cicilline's money -- 68 percent -- has come from large contributions (classified as donations of more than $200) from individual donors. An identical percentage -- 68 percent -- of Doherty's campaign funds also comes from large individual donations.

If you add in the smaller contributions from individuals, Cicilline got 75 percent of his money from individuals compared to 86 percent for Doherty.

We e-mailed the Doherty campaign Sept. 27 asking if they were using a different source for its claim. Spokesman Dave Layman focused on the OpenSecrets data we were looking at.

""The point we were trying to make is that Mr. Doherty has a larger percentage of individual contributions and relies far less on PAC money,"" he said in an e-mail.

""Perhaps, we should have said: 'Both campaigns rely mostly on individual contributions, but about a quarter of Mr. Cicilline’s campaign contributions ($413,806) come from PACs, whereas just 10% of Mr. Doherty’s campaign contributions ($109,250) come from PACs.'  We should have made that clearer,"" Layman wrote.

Our ruling

Brendan Doherty said his campaign, ""unlike the Cicilline Campaign, is funded mostly by individual donors -- not the big PACs that Cicilline relies on.""

Campaign finance data show that both campaigns are funded mostly by individual donors.

Cicilline may have gotten more money from political action committees than Doherty has, but the scope -- 24 percent of $1.7 million raised -- doesn't even come close to supporting a statement suggesting that Cicilline is getting most of his funds from PACs.

We rate Doherty's claim False.

What is the estimated per-square-foot cost to rebuild Portland high schools?
","
In May 2011, Portland voters narrowly rejected a $548 million construction bond measure for Portland Public Schools. Voters said they felt shut out of the process; they wanted more say and oversight. Also, a news analysis by The Oregonian at the time reported that the school rebuilds would be among the costliest in Oregon. The analysis showed the district had budgeted $325 a square foot to renovate six urban schools.

The school board tried again. This time, members said they had heard the people’s cry for greater transparency and fiscal diligence. So they put a $482 million bond measureon the November ballot. The overall size is smaller, at $1.10 a year for every $1,000 of assessed property value for the early years, versus $2 in 2011.

This bond will pay to modernize three high schools and build one K-8 school, plus improve science classrooms and add seismic and roof upgrades at dozens more. School construction costs are $278 million of the $482 million, for four schools; last time costs were about $330 million of $548 million, for nine schools.

In an attempt to assure voters that the district is on the up and up, supporters of Measure 26-144 have posted on their website the answers to two questions that every voter wants to know. How much will this measure cost me? And how do I know the district will spend my money wisely to rebuild these schools? 
  
Question: How much will the rebuilds cost per square foot? 
Answer: The district estimates $208 per square foot in hard costs to rebuild elementary grade schools and $220 per square foot for the high schools. This is the mid-range for Portland Metro hard costs.Read the project estimating method for yourself. 

A school campaign opponent asked us to check out the claim. We obliged, thinking voters would want to know as well. Because, really, what the heck is a hard cost?

The campaign openly links to the sheet we’ll be referencing to give you the skinny on costs. The ""project estimating method"" link on the website states that mid-point ""hard construction"" costs are indeed $208 a square foot for K-8 and $220 a square foot for high schools. (The calculations are by Rider Levett Bucknall, an international firm that estimates costs.)

But hard construction costs, you see, are only a portion of the picture.

There’s also on-site improvement ""hard"" costs estimated at $8 a square foot. That’s money to demolish and mitigate for hazardous materials, and to build walkways, outdoor learning space, storm drains, lighting, etc.

There are ""soft"" costs for architecture work, engineering, planning, design, permitting and project management. These are estimated at an added 20 percent of hard costs.

Let’s not forget contingency costs, which the district estimates at an added 15 percent of both ""hard"" and ""soft"" costs for complete renovations and 10 percent for new construction. And, finally, you can’t really run a school without ""furniture, fixtures and equipment."" Those costs are estimated at $12 a square foot, although the model warns us that numbers can vary.

So what does this mean, as applied to these schools? Because as much as we’d like for the chief campaign backers to do the math for us, they haven’t. We requested and received school lot and building sizes from the district, because those aren’t posted either. We’ll skip the K-8 school and stick to the three high schools. (Roosevelt, by the way, is calculated at $190 a square foot for capacity reasons we won’t get into.)

Here are the basics:

Grant High School is 275,000 square feet, lot size is 444,000 square feet, estimated $95 million.
Franklin is 240,000 square feet, lot size 797,000 square feet, estimated at $85 million.
Roosevelt is 229,000 square feet, lot size 745,000 square feet, estimated at $70 million.

And here are the numbers: 
Those numbers are markedly different from $220. In fact, we’ll do more math for you. Grant’s $333 a square foot is 51 percent more than the stated $220 per square foot of ""hard"" construction costs.

We asked the ""Our Portland, Our Schools"" campaign why not include an overall -- and higher -- figure as well. Spokeswoman Lindsey O’Brien said ""hard costs"" were closest to estimated construction costs so that’s what they posted. ""The most important thing to us is the link to the full document, which goes through everything in detail,"" she said.

It’s great that the campaign posted relevant information on its website. And apparently, it’s perfectly acceptable to compare ""hard"" construction costs within the industry. But breaking it down like that does little to help the average voter understand what it would cost per square foot to rebuild these historic high schools. And that was the question the campaign purportedly tried to answer. 
As we finished our reporting, we noticed that the campaign had added language to its website after our initial inquiry regarding hard costs: ""Total project costs include hard costs (bricks, mortar, labor), soft costs (plans, permits), a contingency factor based on standard practice, and the contents needed to make a new building usable by students and staff.""

It would have been shorter -- and clearer -- to write that the total square footage price for Roosevelt High School is $310, for Grant $333, and for Franklin $353.

Again, we turned to the campaign spokeswoman. Didn’t the school district say that this time, the construction bond measure would be leaner, meaner, more cost efficient and disciplined?

It is, O’Brien said via email. Overall spending is lower, as well as the assessed rate for property owners. In other words, the district is not doing as much as in 2011.

""We have not been arguing that the costs per square foot are different,"" she wrote.

(By the way, Jim Owens with Portland Public Schools, who is in charge of the projects and has extensive experience in public construction and finance and who helped us with the details, said total square footage costs are reasonable and he didn’t think the square footage costs were too high in 2011 either.)

Well, then. To our ruling:

The campaign diligently uses the term ""hard costs"" to relay that square footage costs are estimated by the district at $220 per square foot. The campaign states repeatedly that these are ""hard"" costs, links to a way to get a more complete estimate, and now spells out to voters that other costs are required to make the new building ""usable by students and staff.""

A statement can be accurate, but miss the mark on communicating the complete picture. In this case, total square footage price is estimated to be between $310 to $353 for the three high schools. Those numbers are a significant upgrade from the stated $220, and, guess what -- they are in the ballpark of the original square footage costs in the district’s first attempt at a bond.

We decline for the time being to weigh in on the ""reasonableness"" of the hard costs or final costs. What we can say is that the difference amounts to a pretty important detail missing from the statement. We rule the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C22240>],/factchecks/2012/sep/29/our-portland-our-schools/what-estimated-square-foot-cost-rebuild-portland-h/

","Democratic nominee Ann McLane Kuster, taking her second shot at ousting U.S. Rep. Charlie Bass, R-NH,  took aim at his congressional pay increases to plead her case for representing New Hampshire’s Second Congressional District in 2013.

In a press release titled, ""Congressman Bass’ Hypocrisy on Congressional Pay,"" Kuster targeted Bass’ proposal to reduce congressional pay if Congress fails to act to avoid the sequester.

""After voting to raise his own pay eight times during his fourteen years in Congress, Congressman Bass has apparently had an election-year change of heart,"" Kuster said. ""While we need to cut and cap Congressional pay, New Hampshire voters deserve better than election-year gimmicks from politicians like Congressman Bass who have spent their careers raising their own pay and protecting their Congressional perks.""

PolitiFact has seen its share of jabs over congressional pay increases. PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Virginia have each checked similar claims against congressmen in their states and rated those statements Half True and Mostly True, respectively.

Both checksfound those claims -- like Kuster’s statement -- aren't that clear cut.

In 1989, Congress passed an ethics reform law that included an annual cost of living adjustment.

The automatic pay raise was created in exchange for not getting paid for private speeches. The pay raise, based on a formula, is automatically included in appropriations bills unless Congress takes a vote to stop it. The law -- even if it had the best of intentions -- created a system where members of Congress receive raises without having to be on-record voting for them.

What does exist though, are roll call votes on whether members of Congress were willing to hear amendments to suspend their pay increases.

Members of Congress have seen their pay increase over time. Members initially received $6 a day in 1789; today they receive $174,000 annually.

But because the pay raises are now essentially automatic, the only thing Congress can do is vote to stop them. Bass Represented New Hampshire's Second Congressional District from 1995-2007 and was re-elected in 2010. From 1995-2007, congressional salaries rose from $133,600 in January 1995 to $174,000 in January 2012. To Back up Kuster's claim, her campaign provided eight votes that they say show Bass voted to increase his own pay.         We’ll break them down, starting with the earliest:1999: On July, 15, 1999, the House voted 276-147 with Bass in the majority on ""ordering the previous question"" to essentially defeat a measure to stop the pay raise. The vote was on House Resolution 246, which related to H.R. 2490, the $13.5 billion treasury and general government appropriations bill. The effect: members of Congress accepted a$4,600 pay increase from $136,700 to $141,300 in January 2000.

2000: On July 20, 2000, the House voted 250-173 with Bass in the majority on ""ordering the previous question"" on House Resolution 560, which quashed an amendment to prohibit a pay raise, and allowed for consideration of H.R. 4871, the fiscal 2001 Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill. Congressional salaries increased$3,800 to $145,100 a year in January 2001.

2001: On July 25, 2001, the House voted 293-129 with Bass in the majority, to order the previous
question on House Resolution 206, which prevented an amendment to block the pay increase, and allowed consideration of H.R. 2590, the $32.8 billion fiscal 2002 Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill. In January 2002, House members saw a $4,900 pay increase to $150,000.

2002: On July 18, 2002, the House voted 258-156, Bass in the majority, to order the previous
question on House Resolution 488, which prevented consideration of an amendment to stop the cost-of-living raise, and allowed consideration of H.R. 5120, the fiscal 2003 Treasury Appropriations bill. The vote cleared the way for a $4,700 salary bumpin January 2003 to $154,700.

2003: On Sept. 4, 2003, the House voted 240-173, Bass in the majority, to order the previous
question on House Resolution 351 for consideration of H.R. 2989, the fiscal 2004 Transportation and Treasury Appropriations bill, therefore an amendment seeking to halt a pay raise was not in order, paving the way for Congress’ salary to increase $3,400 in January 2004 to $158,100.

2004: On Sept. 14, 2004, the House voted 235-170, with Bass in the majority, on ordering the previous question for consideration of House Resolution 5025, the fiscal 2005 Transportation and Treasury Appropriations bill. By doing so, the House rejected Rep. Jim Matheson, D-UT's procedural attempt to get a direct vote on the pay raise. Congress received a pay adjustment of 2.5 percent in January 2005, increasing their salary $4,000 to $162,100.

The only House member to speak out against the automatic raise in 2003 or 2004, according to Fox News,  was Rep. Matheson. ""Now is not the time for members of Congress to be voting themselves a pay raise,"" Matheson said. ""Let us send a signal to the American people that we recognize their struggle in America's economy.""

2005: On June 28, 2005, the House voted 263-152with Bass in the majority, on ordering the previous question to again essentially stop Matheson from introducing a measure to block the pay raise. The vote was on House Resolution 342, which related to H.R. 3058, an appropriations bill for transportation and other areas. Congress would receive a $3,100 pay raise, bringing their salary to $165,200.

Alyson Heyrend, Matheson's spokesperson, explained the procedural move.

""Matheson each year sought a 'no' vote on a procedural vote on Ordering the Previous Question,"" she told PolitiFact in an e-mail. ""Had a majority voted 'no' he would have then offered his amendment to deny the annual Congressional pay raise. The process is designed to be obscure -- which is Matheson’s primary concern -- that the public isn't able to see Congress take an open, up-or-down vote on whether or not to raise their salaries.""

2006: On June 13, 2006, the House took a similar vote -- this time 249-167 with Bass in the majority -- on ordering the previous question which again halted Matheson's attempt for an up-or-down vote. The vote was on House Resolution 865, which related to H.R. 5576, an appropriations bill. The result: members would receive a $3,300 pay raise increasing their salaries to $168,500.

But then campaign season kicked in. Democrats vowed not to accept the 2007 pay raise until Congress approved an increase to the minimum wage.

On. Dec. 8, 2006, the House voted 370-20 with Bass in the majority or a stopgap funding measure H.J. 102 until mid February 2007 -- delaying the pay raises. Democrats had planned to offer an amendment to delay the congressional pay raise, so ""House GOP leaders decided to include language deferring the pay raise in the bill, taking away the Democrats' ability to make it an issue,""Congressional Quarterly Today wrote in an article we found in Nexis.

So, did Bass vote to increase his own pay here? Not exactly, his spokesman says.

""Kuster continually cites procedural votes that have nothing to do with pay raises beyond what certain Members of Congress said they intended to do if this procedural vote failed to move the underlying bill along the House floor process,"" said Scott Tranchemontagne, a spokesman for Bass’ ""Victory Committee,"" in an email to PolitiFact.

""However, that same argument could be applied to any issue that was not addressed in the underlying legislation being considered at the time. It’s parliamentary shenanigans.""       Tranchemontagne added that Bass has voted for extended freezes to congressional pay several times, including recently, with H. Res. 3835 and  H.J. Res. 117 which extend Congressional and federal employee pay freezes; and H. Res. 3630-- which would prohibit any pay adjustment for Congress prior to December 31, 2013. Our ruling: Since Congress has essentially built a system that allows for pay raises without direct votes by its members, it’s difficult to say who voted for the raises, which were a tiny part of much larger appropriation bills. What can be seen are votes on procedural moves to block the pay raises, or force an up or down vote. Still, Kuster is exaggerating to cite these eight votes to say Bass voted to raise his own pay, because the votes didn’t do that on their own. Still, Bass cast procedural votes that effectively allowed automatic pay raises to stand for eight years, and the practical effect of those votes meant Bass saw raises. And Kuster left out the fact that Bass has voted for pay freezes.  To us, the two caveats amount to a Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097663E00>],/factchecks/2012/sep/28/ann-mclane-kuster/ann-mclane-kuster-mark-charlie-bass-salary-claim/

Barack Obama says taxes on families are at their lowest point in 50 years
","
In an interview with CBS’ 60 Minutes that aired on Sept. 23, 2012, President Barack Obama defended his economic policies of the past four years, including his tax policies.

Interviewer Steve Kroft noted that on the campaign trail, Mitt Romney has been arguing that Obama is ""crushing economic freedom with taxes, regulations and high-cost health care."" Obama responded, ""Yeah, well, it's a lot of rhetoric, but there aren't a lot of facts supporting it. Taxes are lower on families than they've been probably in the last 50  years. So I haven't raised taxes. I've cut taxes for middle-class families by an average of $3,600 for a typical family.""

The numbers

Since Obama said ""probably in the last 50 years,"" we will be somewhat flexible on the time frame.

The most detailed look at this question comes from a table compiled by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that has analyzed tax plans of the presidential candidates. The table calculates the average federal tax rate for four-person families at three different income levels -- one-half the median income, the median income, and twice the median income. The ""average rate"" means actual taxes paid as a percentage of a taxpayer’s income after deductions and exemptions. The table includes data from 1955 to 2011.

For one-half the median income and the median income, average tax rates were lower in 2009, 2010 and 2011 than any year back to 1955 except for 2008. So Obama's largely right for these groups.

For taxpayers earning twice the median -- which was just over $151,000 in 2011 -- tax rates were lower in Obama’s three years than in any year back 44 years, to 1968. But rates were lower for this group between 1955 and 1967. So by this measure, Obama’s claim wasn’t perfect either.

These figures account for federal taxes only, so we also looked at different data that included all personal taxes -- federal, state and local. A president has the biggest influence over federal taxes but can also indirectly influence state and local taxation by expanding or shrinking the size of federal payments to the states.

Using data from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, we calculated the percentage of personal income spent on taxes back to 1962. We found that taxes as a percentage of personal income has varied in a narrow range over that period, never falling below 9.6 percent and never rising above 14.3 percent.

During the first three years of Obama’s presidency, taxes were 9.6 percent, 9.7 percent and 10.8 percent of personal income, respectively. Those are on the low end of this 50-year time span. The only other years to fall below the 2011 rate were 1964, 1965, 2003 and 2004.

So, again, Obama’s statistical claim isn't entirely correct.

Even though the exceptions to Obama's claim are few, they are significant -- none more so than 2008. 
During the Bush presidency of 2001 to 2008, average tax rates declined steadily. But they bottomed out in 2008 -- which was one year before Obama took office, and the year in which the recession hit full force. They then rose slightly under Obama. 
A key reason for the especially low rates in 2008 was the recession, experts said.

""One expects taxes, in the aggregate, to decrease in a recession,"" said Lawrence J. White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University. The reason: employment shrinks, incomes fall and people move to lower tax brackets.

So while Obama’s policies, such as cuts to the payroll tax, did have some effect on today’s low average tax rates, the policies of his predecessor and the ripple effects of the poor economy Obama inherited also helped keep taxes at historically low levels. 
""Taxes are historically low right now mainly because of the worst recession since the Depression, and the fact that we have record high progressivity in the tax code, meaning heavy reliance on relatively volatile high incomes,"" said William McBride, an economist with the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group.

Our ruling

Obama said, ""Taxes are lower on families than they've been probably in the last 50 years."" 
On the numbers, his statistic isn't exact, but it's pretty close -- average tax rates are in fact lower than most years in the past five decades, at least for the three income groups we looked at. 
However, the decline in average tax rates was already under way under Bush and the recession helped keep them low. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C13340>],/factchecks/2012/sep/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-taxes-families-are-their-lowest-/

NRCC says Illinois candidate David Gill would ""end Medicare""
","Attacks that say a candidate would ""end Medicare"" have typically come from Democrats. But this one comes from the Republicans.

The National Republican Congressional Committee is airing an ad attacking David Gill, the Democratic nominee in Illinois’ 13th Congressional District, an open seat that includes portions of Springfield, Decatur and Champaign. Gill is running against Republican Rodney Davis, a former congressional aide and state party executive director.

Here’s the transcript of the ad:

Narrator: Politician David Gill supports keeping the new health care law, gutting Medicare. But Gill wanted to go further: forcing each American into government-run health care. And to pay for it, Gill supported a new income tax.

Gill (from file video): It would be a 2 percent tax. We could do away with your Medicare tax, because Medicare would no longer exist.

Narrator: David Gill: His plan would end Medicare.

Gill (from file video): Medicare would no longer exist.

Is it true that Gill's plan ""would end Medicare""?

The NRCC pointed us to a 2004 editorial in the Pantagraph, a newspaper in Bloomington, Ill.

""Gill supports, in concept, a national plan put forth by Physicians for National Health Care,"" the editorial said. ""It would require a 2 percent individual income tax and a 7 percent business payroll tax to provide health care to everyone at a cost of about $1.7 trillion a year. Gill emphasized that he is not married to the exact percentages. It would replace the need for Medicare, employer/employee health insurance premiums and the private health insurance industry.""

The NRCC also provided the full video excerpt, from a candidate debate on public television. In the video, Gill speaks favorably of the Physicians for National Health Care plan, though he added, as the editorial noted, that he’s ""not married to … particular numbers"" in the plan.

NRCC spokeswoman Katie Prill said that ""Americans would be forced into government-run healthcare, and taxes would be raised to pay for it all.""

So what is Physicians for National Health Care, and what was their plan? The group bills itself as ""the only national physician organization in the United States dedicated exclusively to implementing a single-payer national health program.""

A single-payer system is one in which the government pays for everyone’s health care, rather than insurance companies. In the debate over health care legislation in 2009, single-payer plans held some appeal among liberal Democrats, but President Barack Obama -- much to the chagrin of many in his own party -- decided to go for a less-aggressive approach that retained a significant role for private insurance companies.

The proposal Gill was referring to was published on Aug. 30, 2003, in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and it remains on the physician group’s website. Here’s an excerpt, with some key points in bold:

""We envision a national health insurance program that builds upon the strengths of the current Medicare system. Coverage would be extended to all age groups, and expanded to include prescription medications and long term care. Payment mechanisms would be structured to improve efficiency and assure prompt reimbursement, while reducing bureaucracy and cost shifting. Health planning would be enhanced to improve the availability of resources and minimize wasteful duplication. Finally, investor-owned facilities would be phased out.""

So let’s put this in perspective. The NRCC isn’t merely criticizing Gill’s ""plan"" -- one he praised with some limitations eight years ago, a time well before passage of President Barack Obama’s health care bill, which was intended to solve some of the health care policy challenges Gill perceived in 2004. Instead, the NRCC is also saying it’s Gill’s intention to ""end Medicare.""

But that’s true only in an Alice in Wonderland sense. The Physicians for National Health Care plan would ""end"" Medicare only because it would aim to put everyone -- not just senior citizens -- in a system designed to run, yes, just like Medicare.

Our ruling

The NRCC ad claims, ""David Gill: His plan would end Medicare.""

But we find that's a ridiculous claim that ignores the sweeping nature of what he supported. He actually supported an expansion of a government-run plan so that everyone would have Medicare-like coverage -- including seniors.

The NRCC ad completely distorts the plan in an attempt to scare seniors. Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809C088F40>],/factchecks/2012/sep/28/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-illinois-candidate-david-gill-would-end-/

Super PAC attacks Lois Frankel over pay raise, jobs record
","
The YG Action Fund launched an ad bashing Democratic congressional candidate Lois Frankel’s tenure as West Palm Beach mayor.

YG (which stands for Young Guns) is supporting Frankel’s Republican opponent Adam Hasner in the Broward/Palm Beach Congressional District 22. Their cartoonish ad shows a smiling headshot of Frankel and makes a series of claims about her tenure as mayor. Here is part of the script:

""Frankel took a 40 percent pay raise with our money. We lost jobs,"" says the narrator while the text on the screen states ""West Palm Beach lost jobs."" The ad then continues: ""Frankel flew from a posh country club to a party across town in a police helicopter. You sat in traffic. Frankel went on a spending spree resulting in a budget deficit. You? Higher taxes to pay for it. $13,000 in taxpayer money for a designer marble bathroom in Frankel's office.""

You can read here about a TV station pulling the ad over a dispute about the word ""deficit."" (A spokesman for the PAC told us that a new version omits the word ""deficit"" and that some other stations didn’t object to the original version.)

For this fact-check, we will examine whether Frankel took a 40 percent pay raise while West Palm Beach lost jobs.

2004 pay raise 
The ad doesn’t explain when Frankel -- who served as mayor from 2003 to 2011 -- took that 40 percent pay raise. A spokesman for the PAC said the pay raise referred to 2004 and sent us quotes from Palm Beach Post articles that year.

We will pull information from those articles:

In January 2004, Frankel formed a committee to explore whether she and commissioners should get a pay raise. She said she was forming the committee because the city code required an annual review of all employee salaries. At the time, the city foresaw a budget shortfall of $110,000 -- the prior year it had a $2 million shortfall.

The committee recommended increasing the mayor’s salary and the city commission obliged. (We were unable to quickly obtain the committee’s report or commission meeting minutes ourselves from a city spokesman so we relied on the Post’s articles about it.)

On July 6, 2004, the city commission unanimously voted to raise Frankel’s salary from $89,250 to $125,000 effective Oct. 1. That’s an increase of about $35,750 or 40 percent. The last time the mayor received a raise was 1998, the Post wrote.

Frankel didn’t vote on the pay raise, her campaign said. The city has a strong mayor form of government in which the mayor votes to break a tie, which wasn’t necessary in this case.

The Post wrote that Frankel’s new salary would place her in the middle range compared with other strong mayors. (Strong mayors tend to earn higher salaries than other mayors because strong mayors are the chief executive.) The city commissioners received a smaller pay boost.

(PolitiFact Florida contacted a couple other large cities with strong mayors and found these annual salaries in 2004: Tampa, $135,000; St. Petersburg $110,334.)

An analyst in the city’s human resources department told us that Frankel’s annual salary remained at $125,000 from 2004 through 2011.

Frankel’s response about the pay raise

Frankel doesn’t dispute that she got that pay raise.

""The city commission voted unanimously to adopt the recommendations of a blue-ribbon committee that called for raising the salaries of West Palm Beach's elected officials to be more competitive,"" wrote Frankel spokesman Joshua Karp. He cited this sentence from a Palm Beach Post article: The blue-ribbon committee ""said the mayor’s pay hadn’t kept pace with the demands of the job in a fast-growing city.""

But as for the second half of the claim -- while West Palm Beach ""lost jobs"" -- Frankel points to some different statistics about employment than those sent to us by the PAC.

Were taxpayers losing their own jobs while paying Frankel a higher paycheck? 
The ad says that West Palm Beach lost jobs as Frankel’s own taxpayer-funded paycheck soared.

A spokesman for the PAC sent us data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics about the unemployment rate starting in March 2003 when Frankel took office and through her tenure in March 2011 and beyond. But that data was for the entire metropolitan area, which extends beyond the city boundaries.

We looked at Local Area Unemployment Statistics data for just the city of West Palm Beach. That showed the unemployment rate rose from 5.8 percent in March 2003 to 10.2 percent in March 2011. Frankel’s tenure overlapped with the national recession -- the rise in unemployment wasn’t unique to her city.

But during her tenure, the number of employed workers also rose -- from 42,876 to 44,848. (Her campaign cited some regional figures showing growth in the number of employed people.)

So while it’s true that unemployment rose, the number of employed workers also rose.

We interviewed Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central Florida about the unemployment statistic emphasized by one side and the employment figures emphasized by the other. Both are important to get a picture of the labor market, he said.

""You can't cherry-pick your favorite statistic and point to that and have it as definitive evidence,"" he said. ""Neither is superior.""

The unemployment rate relates to the number of unemployed people relative to the labor force. That means if some unemployed people give up looking for work, the employment rate can improve even though in reality the situation hasn’t improved.

Generally speaking, city mayors can’t take much of the blame or credit for unemployment or employment.

""There is only so much (mayors) can do when financial markets are in disarray, and the housing market has imploded,"" Snaith said. ""I don’t care how adept you are at sweet-talking businesses.""

If we thought that Frankel should take the blame for the unemployment spike during part of her tenure then we’d also have to give her credit for the drop in annual unemployment to below 4 percent between 2005 and 2007.

Our ruling 
The YG Action PAC said that ""Frankel took a 40 percent pay raise as mayor."" Frankel did form a committee to explore whether she should get a pay raise and that resulted in a 40 percent boost -- an extra $35,750 -- in 2004. However the ad omits the context for that raise -- the mayor’s salary hadn’t had an increase since 1998 and after she got the raise in 2004, her salary then remained set at $125,000 a year until she left office in 2011.

The ad also stated that while Frankel got a hefty pay hike, the city ""lost jobs."" The unemployment rate rose from about 5.8 percent to 10.2 percent during her tenure. But the number of employed actually increased slightly and Frankel can’t be blamed for a national recession.

If we look at the big swing that occurred in the economy, ""no mayor in the world would be able to counterbalance the forces that were in play,"" Snaith said.

For those omissions about context, we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C07E700>],/factchecks/2012/sep/28/yg-action-fund/super-pac-attacks-lois-frankel-over-pay-raise-jobs/

Val Demings says Daniel Webster “used taxpayer funds to build a lobbyist lounge”
","
For a few seconds, the political attack looks like a scene from Mad Men. A man wearing a suit relaxes in a tall leather chair, his hand holding a cigar as smoke wafts above a crystal decanter of brandy nearby.

He’s inside no ordinary members-only club. This space is reserved for lobbyists, paid for by taxpayers and the brainchild of Republican U.S. Rep. Daniel Webster.

Well, so says a TV commercial from the Democrat seeking to unseat Webster from his Orlando-based seat, former Orlando Police Chief Val Demings.

""Thirty-year politician Daniel Webster used taxpayer funds to build a lobbyist lounge,"" the narrator says in the ad.

Sounds like a pretty swank idea for a man who’s made a career of preaching frugality (and who, by the way, doesn’t drink). We wanted to know if he really spent tax money on a lounge for lobbyists.

Webster became speaker of the Florida House in 1996 -- a huge year for House Republicans, who regained control of the House for the first time in 122 years. Webster wanted to do something special for the Republican minority leaders outnumbered all those years by Democrats. Many of those former Republican leaders had since become lobbyists.

Webster spent about $100,000 for renovations to the speaker’s office suite when he took power, according to news accounts (PolitiFact Florida examined how that compares to other speakers in this 2010 check).

Of that, no one knows how much -- if any -- he spent furnishing one office he wanted to reserve for the past minority leaders to use. PolitiFact Florida asked the Department of Management Services and the Florida House for expenditures from the makeover, but did not hear back. (The state worker who kept tabs on the renovations is on vacation, we’re told.)

""The room cost nothing to create, and was a converted windowless office with a threadbare couch and House archived photos on the wall,"" Webster campaign spokeswoman Katie Patchett said in a statement.

Demings’ spokeswoman pointed us to a 2000 Tampa Tribune article about the close relationship shared by former legislators-turned-lobbyists and current lawmakers. The story mentioned Webster’s special room for leaders in connection with how these lobbyists enjoy ""special privileges at taxpayer expense."" The article did not include a breakdown of costs for the office.

People who remember the ""leaders room"" paint a picture of simplicity: a loveseat, some chairs, pictures of the leaders on the walls, a TV and a telephone.

""And that’s it,"" said Ronald Richmond, who was House minority leader from 1982-84 before turning to lobbying. ""There’s no liquor in there, there’s no beer in there, no Cokes in there, no water in there. Unless they know something I don’t know, and I go there a lot, it ain’t a big deal.""

Webster had one big rule, they say: No lobbying. No bringing in clients.

""There was no lobbying,"" Richmond said. ""Oh, heavens no.""

The former Republican House leaders who could use the room, though, had new jobs as lobbyists, which bothered Democrats. Five minority leaders-turned-lobbyists were singled out in 1997 as having access to the room: Curt Kiser, James M. Lombard, Dale Patchett, Richmond and Jim Tillman.

As the former leaders rested their feet or watched session unfold on a boxy TV, Webster occasionally stopped by to ask them for advice about the legislative process. They were his sounding board, said Kiser, a minority leader-turned-lobbyist-turned general counsel for the Florida Public Service Commission.

The gesture garnered some criticism, and not necessarily about the costs of such a room.

""I just think it was a hypocrisy of pretending you’re gonna be fiscally responsible and then bam, you’re gonna turn around and do that,"" said former House Democratic Leader Buzz Ritchie, who was in line to become speaker before the Republicans took over.

Capitol observers don’t remember Webster as being particularly friendly to lobbyists. In fact, he put new rules in place during his tenure that sought to diminish the influence of lobbyists by keeping them out of his office the last -- and most critical -- week of session.

Still, some saw the leaders-only lounge as a blemish on his transparency scorecard, including the editorial board of the Tampa Bay Times. The board called for the room’s closure and dubbed it a ""Republican clubhouse."" 
""Webster wants to honor the Republican leaders who preceded him and share the spoils of power. A nice painting and a plaque ought to be enough.""

Webster moved on, first to the Florida Senate and in 2010 to Congress, but the room remained in some form. His successor, current state Sen. John Thrasher, moved the room to the Majority Office area and converted the old lounge to a staff office, according to the 2000 Tampa Tribune story.

Former minority leaders, speakers and Republican majority leaders still congregate there, lobbyist or not.

""I have to tell you more of the more hilarious moments in my life go on there,"" Richmond said. ""Sandy Mortham (a former minority leader who became Secretary of State) can keep you in stitches.""

Richmond has few complaints, save for the absence of the landline phone and the ""ancient"" box TV.

""The picture’s good, but we don’t have a changer,"" he said, referring to a remote control.

Our ruling 
Demings is attacking Webster for using ""taxpayer money to build a lobbyist lounge."" It’s true that some newspapers characterized a room Webster set aside for a select group of former Republican leaders turned lobbyists as a ""comfortable lounge"" enjoyed ""at taxpayer expense.""

There is plenty of deception and hyperbole mixed in here, though. Webster did not build the room (it was an existing office); it’s unclear how much, if any, taxpayer money went toward its furnishings (maybe a phone line at one point?); and access was generally limited to former Republican leaders.

Moreover, the room is a far cry from the Cognac-ridden and smoke-filled country club-style lounge the ad would have viewers imagine. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A62580>],/factchecks/2012/sep/28/val-demings/val-demings-says-daniel-webster-used-taxpayer-fund/

Bill Clinton says TARP turned a profit
","The financial crisis of 2008 spawned some new terminology -- ""too big to fail"" and the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

TARP, as it's more commonly known, is the $700 billion in government money set up to rescue banks such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, and a host of other financial entities, big and not so big.

There were dire predictions on TARP’s final cost to taxpayers. The Congressional Budget Office said it could top $350 billion. But the payback was higher than expected, which former President Bill Clinton mentioned during an interview on The Daily Show. Describing the atmosphere at the height of the financial crisis, Clinton said, ""Everybody was all hands on deck and they did a lot of things, including the unpopular TARP bill to keep us from falling into a depression. By the way, you have gotten the TARP money back plus a profit.""

This is something the former president has said before, so we decided to see if it is correct.

It isn’t.

""The point about coming out ahead is wrong ,"" said Paul Kiel who has covered the bailout for the investigative news site ProPublica. ""But TARP won’t be as much in the hole as people feared.""

Clinton is right only if you look just at the money that went to banks. According to the latest update from the Treasury Department, $245 billion went out the door to banks and $266 billion came back. The $21 billion gain came from dividends and gains when Washington sold the shares it held.

But TARP went beyond banks. The government put $80 billion into General Motors, Chrysler and GM’s financial subsidiary, GMAC. Another $68 billion went to the insurance company, American International Group, AIG. On a much smaller scale, $5 billion has been used to help homeowners avoid defaulting on their mortgages and other housing market assistance.

This is where Clinton’s statement goes off track. The government still has plenty of money tied up in GM, GMAC and AIG. Between the three, taxpayers are looking at about $57 billion outstanding.

Once you account for the profit made on the banking side, TARP is $34 billion in the hole.

That is a fraction, about 10 percent, of the original estimate. Where TARP ends up is of course a matter of educated guesswork, but most analysts expect the loss to decline further. In March, the Congressional Budget Office predicted the total lifetime cost would be $32 billion. Kiel thinks it could drop below $20 billion. Kiel is bullish on AIG.

""It’s extremely likely that all the AIG money will come back,"" Kiel said, ""and it could even be positive.""

In 2010, Congress capped the program at $475 billion. Looking ahead, the greatest uncertainty lies with the housing foreclosure program within TARP. The government has barely dipped into the $45 billion available and there’s over a year left for people to apply. Whatever is spent will not be repaid.

Our ruling

Former President Clinton said government got the TARP money back plus interest.

That is correct for the money that went to banks. It is incorrect for TARP as a whole. The program remains about $34 billion in the red.

We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AE5B00>],/factchecks/2012/sep/28/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-tarp-turned-profit/
"['Ohio', 'Elections', 'Jon Husted']","
Jon Husted says online address tool would have cut Ohio's 2008 provisional ballot totals by 130,000
","
Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted has found himself in the crosshairs of Democrats and concerned voting groups in recent months who worry the Republican officer wasn’t doing enough to open up greater access to voting.

But there was one move Husted did this summer that pushed his critics back on their heels for a fleeting moment of agreement: when the secretary announced on Aug. 9 that his staff had made it possible for registered Ohio voters to now update and change their home addresses online through his office’s web site.

The goal is ultimately have fewer Ohio voters using those sometimes unreliable and uncounted provisional ballots. People who want to vote on Election Day can be turned away if their address does not match the information in polling books. The backup plan for those people is to use provisional ballots, which are set aside for verification and don’t always end up being counted later.
 
""If voters take advantage of this new tool and update their address online, it is likely that a lot fewer of them would have to vote a provisional ballot,"" Husted said at a news conference at his office the day he announced the change. Aside from a few reports of glitches in using the system, the news went over well.

But at the news conference that day, Husted sought to sell his idea even more by declaring that had this system been in place during the 2008 presidential election about 130,000 Ohioans who used provisional ballots might not have had to. He backed it up by blasting a news release to the masses from his office later that day.

""Had the online change of address been in place in 2008 an estimated 130,000 voters who cast provisional ballots could have changed their address online and voted a regular ballot,"" he said in the news release.

He made an identical claim in another news release Sept. 17, 2012.

That seemed like a fairly bold claim to PolitiFact Ohio. Consider that the state secretary of state’s office didn’t start tracking ""wrong address"" as a reason for having to use a provisional ballot in its routine post-election reports until 2011.

So Politifact Ohio asked the Husted’s staff for an explanation. How can you say how many people would have changed their addresses and avoided a provisional ballot in 2008 had this online address change been in effect?

After all, voters have always had the chance to change their addresses in-person.

The answer is Husted’s office doesn’t know — for certain. Husted’s spokesman Matt McClellan noted that the key word in the statement uttered in August by the secretary and plopped in the the news releases is ""estimated"".

""It is just an estimate assuming that voters would have taken advantage of the opportunity to change their addresses online,"" McClelland said.

OK, so how did you arrive at such an ""estimate""?

Here’s McClelland’s explanation. Pay close attention or this might feel like a confusing mathematical equation.

First, the office determined what percentage of voters using a provisional ballot in this year’s primary were forced to do so because they had a wrong address. That’s 11,912 wrong addresses out of 20,062 total provisionals for a rate of 59.4 percent.

Second, the office determined what percentage of voters using a provisional ballot in the November 2011 general election were forced to do so because they had an incorrect address. That’s 51,404 out of 76,525 for a rate of 67.2 percent.

Next, the office looked at the number of provisionals cast in November 2008 (206,859) and multiplied that number by 67.2 percent and 59.4 percent, for totals of 139,009 and 122,874 respectively.

Lastly, the office then took the average between 139,000 and 123,000 and came up with its 130,000 estimate.

Follow that?

""I feel pretty good about it,"" McClelland said, after explaining the unscientific statistical analysis applied by the secretary’s office.

We at Politifact Ohio have been called a lot of things, but brilliant statisticians isn’t one of them. We asked Case Western Reserve University professor and chair of the mathematics department, Daniela Calvetti, to please weigh in.

""I think it is a reasonable way of estimating how many voters would be able to take advantage of this if everyone who had a provisional ballot due to incorrect address indeed went online and changes the address electronically we would have about 130,000 voters,"" Calvetti said.

""There is no reason to believe that the percentages would vary much because 67 percent and 59 percent are not very far (apart) in particular since one was a primary and one was a general,"" she said. ""I think it is a sound way of making the projection.""

So where does that leave Husted’s claim?

An independent expert backed the methodology Husted used to come up with the figure of 130,000, and the statement describes that as an estimate.

But the figure assumes all people would have taken advantage of the online address change, which is not certain. That’s additional information that provides clarification..

On the Truth-O-Meter, Husted’s claim rates Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BB3D00>],/factchecks/2012/sep/28/jon-husted/jon-husted-says-online-address-tool-would-have-cut/
"['Debt', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Ron Johnson']","
Sen. Ron Johnson says deficits under Obama total $5.3 trillion, compared with $2 trillion under Bush
","
Remember those nerdy charts that Ross Perot flashed during his third-party run for president in 1992?

The Texas billionaire’s visual aids warned of the perils of America’s mounting government debt.

Twenty years later, Wisconsin’s junior U.S. Senator, Republican Ron Johnson, is taking a page from Perot as he acts as a surrogate for Mitt Romney and advocates for a spending slowdown.

Explaining one of his digital charts during a Sept. 11, 2012 campaign stop in Sheboygan, Johnson ripped Obama for saying his administration’s proposed ""Buffett rule""  tax plan for million-dollar earners would ""stabilize our debt and deficits for the next decade.""

""I haven’t yet publicly called President Obama a liar,"" Johnson told his audience. ""But I’m saying he lies. Slight diplomatic difference.""

Johnson said the ""Buffett rule"" would raise just $5 billion a year. He’s right, as PolitiFact Ohio found in rating True a claim by Sen. Rob Portman that it would ""bring in less than $5 billion per year. ... Enough to pay one week’s interest on the national debt.""

Johnson’s presentation uses a chart to contrast the ""Buffett Rule’s"" revenue potential to the deficits accumulated under Obama (2009-2012) and over the two terms of his predecessor, Republican George W. Bush (2001-2008).

The chart shows deficits totalling $2 trillion in eight years under Bush, and $5.3 trillion under Obama in just four years. A caption on the chart says those deficits ""exploded during the Obama administration.""

Is Johnson right on the deficit numbers and their rapid growth?

As backup, Johnson’s campaign cited numbers from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget.

The figures show red-ink budgets in seven of eight years that coincide with Bush’s term. The annual deficits totalled $820 billion in his first term and nearly $1.2 trillion in his second.

Add them up and there’s the $2 trillion figure cited by Johnson.

That same White House table shows four years of deficits for 2009-’12, the time frame that coincides with the Obama era, ranging from $1.29 trillion to $1.4 trillion. The total, including estimated figures for 2012, is $5.33 trillion.

That’s nearly triple the Bush deficit figure, in half the time.

It seems simple, with the numbers and the trend matching up with Perot’s, er, Johnson’s chart.

We wish it were that simple.

But there is considerable disagreement in academic and political circles over how to assign responsibility to presidents for spending and deficits.

Using the same table and a slightly different approach can put a somewhat different spin on the trend line -- though we found no scenario under which the Bush-era deficits top those under Obama.

Here’s why.

The big question any researcher faces is when to start and end the clock when looking at spending and deficit by presidents.

It would be tidy to start the clock on Inauguration Day, but the federal budget year begins Oct. 1. That means an incoming president inherits a budget-in-progress from his predecessor, though he often makes changes.

That timing mismatch makes a pretty big difference, for example, in pinning deficit numbers on Bush and Obama.

To wit: Democrat Bill Clinton’s last budget, for fiscal 2001, resulted in a surplus of $128 billion -- the last black-ink budget on record. But Johnson attributed that surplus to Bush, who entered office Jan. 20, 2001. Johnson argues that once elected the budget can be changed by the new president.

Similarly, on the back end of the Bush years, Johnson gives the eye-popping 2009 deficit of     $1.4 trillion all to Obama -- even though Obama was working with Bush’s last budget, which took effect in October 2008, during the final months of Bush’s second term.

That methodology becomes even more important when you consider that just before Bush left office, the deficit for fiscal year 2009 already was projected to be $1.2 trillion, according to the scorekeeping agency for Congress, as reported by PolitiFact.

So, Johnson attributes the 2009 deficit entirely to Obama even though much it was already anticipated before the Democrat’s inauguration. (By the end of the 2009 fiscal year, the deficit rose to $1.4 trillion in part due to Obama’s economic stimulus plan).

What about Johnson’s methodology?

We asked three experts who closely follow the budget, and each said there is no consensus on how to attribute the overlapping budget years.

Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said apportioning responsibility is ""really tricky.""

""Looking at what has happened -- budget deficit-wise -- during the Bush and the Obama presidencies doesn’t tell the whole picture because of the differences of the fiscal year and impacts of policies that were enacted prior to either of them assuming office,"" Ellis wrote in an email.

Still, Ellis said he considered Johnson’s numbers correct even if the presentation was simplistic.

What’s more, there are some extra complicating factors unique to the Bush-Obama changeover, such as how best to parcel out the deficit blame for such things as Bush’s major tax cuts and Obama’s more modest tax trims, two wars that overlap their presidencies, two recessions, a Wall Street bailout that each supported, and major new programs under each (Medicare prescription drugs, stimulus).

The Great Recession of 2007-2009, which fueled deficits when tax collections fell, also overlapped the two presidencies.

Jason Peuquet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Johnson’s numbers were defensible. He suggested looking at the increase in debt -- as opposed to deficits -- because it can be tracked to the day a president starts and ends a term.

By that measure, we found a $4.9 trillion increase in gross public debt in Bush’s two terms vs. $5.4 trillion so far in Obama’s single term.

Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said ""there is no good answer to your question that is going to satisfy everyone.""

Our rating

Johnson’s chart showed $2 trillion in deficits under Bush and $5.3 trillion under Obama, and concluded that deficits ""exploded"" during the Obama administration.

The numbers check out, but comparing presidents’ budget records is not as simple as Johnson’s chart suggests. For instance, Bush owns some debatable piece of the Obama deficits.

"['Georgia', 'Federal Budget', 'Kasim Reed']","
Kasim Reed says numbers don't work in Paul Ryan's budget plan
 ","
Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has been racking up the frequent-flier miles lately to travel to Washington to advocate for President Barack Obama on the long-running television program ""Meet the Press.""

During Reed’s most recent appearance, the mayor frequently criticized Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. The mayor also attempted to carve up GOP running mate Paul Ryan’s proposal to cut the federal budget deficit.

""[T]o get a budget deal, we have to have revenue-raising measures. You cannot implement Paul Ryan's plan while not allowing for any increases in revenue,"" Reed, a Democrat, said on the program Sunday.

We wondered whether Reed is right. Can cuts be made to levels that Ryan has proposed without raising taxes or finding other ways to increase revenue?

Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, has made several proposals to curb federal spending and maintain the viability of entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. Ryan has said his budget could cut the deficit by as much as $5 trillion over 10 years. 

The mayor’s office said Reed disagrees with Ryan’s plan from a policy perspective and he doesn’t believe it will pass in Congress. Reed and nearly 150 mayors across America signed a letter dated Sept. 21 that was written to congressional leaders in both parties urging them to pass legislation as soon as possible with a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases to address the nation’s budget deficit. 
Romney campaign officials responded to our request for comment about the Ryan plan. Romney has said he agrees with much of what Ryan has proposed, with a few tweaks. The campaign forwarded us several studies that support Romney’s argument that his plan can be done with no tax increases.

""The Romney-Ryan plan would lower rates for all taxpayers while eliminating loopholes and carve-outs in the tax code,"" Romney spokesman Brendan Buck said. ""This will bring in additional revenue through economic growth, rather than tax hikes as the president has proposed.""

The Romney camp pointed us to an article by Martin Feldstein, former head of the Council of Economic Advisors under President Ronald Reagan, to bolster its argument. Feldstein wrote in The Wall Street Journal in August that ""it is feasible to combine tax cuts and base broadening as Gov. Romney suggests without raising the budget deficit or imposing any middle-class tax increase.""

David Stockman, who was a director of the Office of Management and Budget under Reagan, said the Ryan plan does not go deep enough on the spending side and does not offer enough detail about how it would broaden the tax base.

""In short, Mr. Ryan’s plan is devoid of credible math or hard policy choices,"" Stockman wrote in The New York Times.

The latest version of the Ryan plan, written March 20, would repeal the federal health care law, cut the federal workforce by 10 percent by 2015, convert the federal share of Medicaid spending into block grants, allow more private-sector competition for Medicare coverage in an effort to lower costs and employ other cost-cutting measures. To grow the economy, Ryan has proposed cutting tax rates (to 10 percent and 25 percent) and reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent to encourage investment and discretionary spending.

Ryan says his plan, titled Path to Prosperity, would cut the deficit by $5 trillion over the next 10 years and balance the budget by 2050. The national debt is currently $16 trillion. Ryan says federal revenue would nearly double in 10 years, from $2.44 trillion to $4.6 trillion. Obama’s plan calls for a mix of less-intensive spending cuts and a tax increase on the wealthiest earners.

Ryan mentions closing tax loopholes in his plan, but there are few specifics. Ryan has said in interviews that a Romney administration would have an open debate with Congress about loopholes. 
""Now the question is not necessarily what loopholes go, but who gets them?"" Ryan said during an ABC News interview. ""High-income earners use most of the loopholes. That means they can shelter their income from taxation.""

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which reviews fiscal plans for Congress, has examined the Ryan plan. The federal government would collect less revenue under the plan than under its baseline projections. The government, though, would spend less under the plan. The deficit would be slightly less under the plan, the CBO concluded. Still, the CBO said in a March 2012 report that projections for revenue are ""highly uncertain"" for many reasons. 

The federal Congressional Research Service published a study in September that examined whether there has been a cause and effect between lowering tax rates and economic growth. The study began by looking at tax rates since 1945 because most American families did not file a tax return before World War II. It concluded ""that changes over the past 65 years in the top marginal tax rate and the top capital gains tax rate do not appear correlated with economic growth.""

Reed’s office says Ryan’s plan is not feasible, citing CBO research and criticism by New York Times columnists David Brooks, a conservative, and Paul Krugman, a liberal and Nobel Prize-winning economics professor who called it ""absurd"" because of how it would reduce discretionary spending.

""Ryan’s plan envisions cutting $6 trillion from federal spending over the next 10 years, but it would eliminate or slash so many programs that the federal government would be unrecognizable,"" the mayor’s office told us via email. 

Diane Lim Rogers, chief economist of the Virginia-based Concord Coalition, a bipartisan organization created in the 1990s to alert the public about the federal deficit, said the Ryan plan lacks specifics. She cited the CRS report, saying ""tax cuts are not a reliable way to raise revenue.""

To sum up, the mayor said, ""You cannot implement Paul Ryan’s plan without allowing for any increases in revenue."" 

Reed’s argument is strengthened by some of the nonpartisan historical research on tax cuts and its impact on the economy, as well as Ryan’s statements that he would propose ending some loopholes, which is another form of increasing revenue. But even critics of Ryan’s plan say there is a path to the deficit reduction the congressman has proposed, though Reed and others may not like cuts that would be required to line up with the revenue projections.

"['Tennessee', 'Congress', 'Federal Budget', 'Bob Corker']","
Bob Corker says Senate has not passed a budget in more than three years
","
Congress headed home for its six-week, pre-election break on Sept. 22, after the U.S. Senate voted just past midnight to give final approval to a short-term budget measure that will keep the federal government running for another six months.

The decision to approve a short-term budget fix instead of passing a spending plan for the entire fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 again set off a debate about whether lawmakers were acting irresponsibly.

""We haven’t passed a budget in more than three years and not a single appropriations bill has been brought to the floor this year,"" U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said in a press release explaining why he voted against the short-term measure.

Corker argued Congress should not be passing the short-term measure, known as a continuing resolution, or any spending bill until it has prioritized how taxpayer dollars are to be spent and at what levels.

""If the Senate can’t perform its most basic responsibilities,"" Corker said, ""I worry about how we’re going to make the tough decisions and do the hard work that will be necessary to get our country on a path to fiscal solvency.""

To back up the senator’s claim about congressional inaction on a budget and spending bills, Corker’s office pointed us to two documents compiled by Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee.

The first was a timeline indicating that the last time the Democratic-led Senate passed a budget was on April 29, 2009. The other document was a status report on all 12 of the annual spending bills that provide funding for federal departments and agencies. According to that document, not one of the 12 spending bills has been considered by the full Senate this year.

Corker is not the first Republican to take the Democratic-led Senate to task for failing to pass a budget. PolitiFact and its partners in other states have examined at least five similar claims in the past, and rulings on those have varied because the statements were worded differently.

When statements attempted to pin the blame squarely on just one political party for the inaction, rulings of Half True were given. But in a case where blame was not heaped on just one party, as is the case with Corker’s statement, PolitiFact has gone with True or Mostly True, depending on the wording of the claim.

In any case, each of those statements cited the same date – April 29, 2009 – as the last time a budget had been approved.

An April 26, 2012, item from PolitiFact Ohio explained how the budget process is supposed to work:

Since the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Senate and the House are supposed to pass budget resolutions in the spring. These budget resolutions set a framework for spending, taxation and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year. They also lay out general plans for the next four years. If these budget resolutions differ, the chambers are supposed to hammer out a compromise.

Budget resolutions are policy plans. They are not appropriations bills, or spending bills, which actually allocate money for specific purposes.

If a budget resolution doesn’t pass, the federal government won’t go dark. In the absence of a budget resolution, appropriations bills have continued to allocate money. 

What about Corker’s claim that not a single appropriations bill has been brought to the Senate floor this year?

The U.S. House passed seven of the 12 annual appropriations bills this year and sent them to the Senate for consideration, according to the status report by Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee also approved 11 of the 12 spending bills and sent them to the full Senate for consideration.

An independent search by PolitiFact via the Library of Congress’ Thomas bill-tracking web site confirmed the figures cited in the GOP report.

But none of the bills approved by the House or the Senate Appropriations Committee were ever brought to the Senate floor for a vote. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who decides which bills will be considered, told reporters on July 10, 2012, that no spending bills were likely to be approved this year because of an ongoing dispute with House Republicans over how much the federal government should spend.

True to his word, Reid so far has not brought any of the annual spending bills to the floor this year, necessitating the short-term budget measure to keep the government running for another six months.

Previous PolitiFact items on claims like this also have brought this perspective -- there have been times when Republicans have been in charge and also have failed to pass a budget.

Our colleagues at PolitiFact Florida report that the House and the Senate had failed to pass a joint budget bill on four other occasions since 1983.

For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, under Democratic control in 2002, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind. For fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007, the House and the Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. In these latter three cases, the Republicans were in the majority in both chambers of Congress.

Our ruling

Sen. Corker says it has been more than three years since Congress passed a budget and that this year, not a single appropriations bill has made it the Senate floor. The record shows that he has his facts straight.

While other Republicans have tried to lay the blame for the lack of a budget at the feet of Democrats, Corker does not specifically apportion blame just one party. He simply chastised the Senate in general for failing to pass a budget and we rate his statement as True.

"['Rhode Island', 'Gambling', 'Eugene McKenna']","
President of Concerned Citizens Against Casino Gambling says studies suggest Rhode Island has 7,500 to 22,000 gambling addicts
","
This November, Rhode Island voters will decide if Twin River in Lincoln and Newport Grand in Newport should be allowed to become full-scale casinos.

The state constitution requires that any expansion of gambling be approved not only by voters statewide but also by a majority of the voters in the city or town where the gambling facilities are located.

On Sept. 13, 2012, Alliance for a Livable Newport held a forum to hear from supporters and opponents of the casino measure.

Among the speakers was the Rev. Eugene J. McKenna, president of Concerned Citizens Against Casino Gambling, who talked about the social costs of gambling.

He told the audience that according to Dr. Robert Breen, a psychiatrist who heads Rhode Island Hospital’s gambling treatment program, thousands of Rhode Islanders could be harmed by expanded gambling.

""He said there’s at least 7,500 addicted gamblers in Rhode Island, at least,"" McKenna said, citing Breen. ""He said it could be as high as 22,000.""

We wondered whether Father McKenna quoted the numbers accurately -- and where they came from -- so we called Breen, who heads the hospital’s gambling treatment program.

In our phone interview, Breen confirmed the figures, saying they were derived from estimates of the rate of gambling addiction nationwide. If you apply those rates to  Rhode Island’s population of about 1 million, he said, you come up with roughly 7,500 to 22,500. (For his calculation, he used addiction rates of .75 to 2.5 percent.)

They were the same numbers Breen used in a commentary piece he wrote, published June 17, 2012, in The Providence Journal.

When trying to estimate the number of gambling addicts in the United States, the first step is to define the term. Most academic analyses of the issue use the criteria set by the American Psychiatric Association.

The criteria includes things such as needing to gamble larger and larger amounts to get the same excitement, returning the day after a big loss to try to win it back, lying to family members, therapists and others to conceal the extent of their gambling, and committing illegal acts to finance gambling.

Studies spanning 35 years put the percentage of problem gamblers roughly in the range Breen and Father McKenna cited. However, not all problem gamblers are addicts. Most studies show there is a scale of severity, with only a third of problem gamblers reaching the most severe level, which the studies describe with different terms.

For example, a 1976 University of Michigan study estimated the rate of lifetime ""compulsive"" gamblers to be .77 percent and the rate of potential compulsive gamblers to be 2.33 percent.

In 1997, Howard J. Shaffer, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard University Medical School and director of the school’s Division on Addiction, analyzed data from 119 studies on problem gambling in the United States and Canada. His report said 1.6 percent of the population meets the pathological gambler standard and 3.85 percent show signs of it.

In a 2009 report,The National Center for Responsible Gaming, a research organization financed by the gambling industry, said Shaffer’s findings were still the norm. In that study, Christine Reilly, at the time executive director of the Institute for Research on Gambling Disorders, reviewed studies from 1976 to 2005 and said they all  reflected the same range.

""Prevalence estimates of disordered gambling within the general adult population have remained relatively stable from study to study, time  to time and place to place,"" she wrote.

Breen said he used prevalence rates developed by Rachel Volberg, president of Gemini Research in Northampton, Mass., which studies gambling and gambling-related issues.    

Shaffer said Breen’s overall number was right, but he made more of a distinction between compulsive and problem gamblers.

""The most recent estimates of pathological gambling in the United States are about 0.6 or 0.7 percent of the population,"" Shaffer said. ""Another 2-3 percent of the population experience subclinical [showing some signs of pathological gambling, but not all of them] gambling problems.""

Our Ruling

The Rev. Eugene J. McKenna said that, based on rates found in national and international studies, there are between 7,500 and 22,500 adult gambling addicts in Rhode Island.

Father McKenna accurately cited estimates by Breen, the Rhode Island Hospital doctor who treats problem gamblers. He, in turn, was citing ranges found in decades of research in North America. However, neither made it clear that those ranges covered a spectrum of problem gamblers, not all of whom are gambling addicts.

Because the statement is accurate, but needs clarification, or additional information, we find it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097060640>],/factchecks/2012/sep/28/eugene-mckenna/president-concerned-citizens-against-casino-gambli/

Carol Shea-Porter distorts Frank Guinta's voting record on veterans programs
","
Veterans funding was back in the news recently as the U.S. Senate failed to take up a new veterans jobs bill. But, even before the vote, one New Hampshire congressional candidate was already taking aim over the issue.

In a television ad, released Sept. 18 in and around New Hampshire, former Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, who is once again challenging U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta, charged her opponent with failing to support the country’s veterans.

""Tea Party Congressman Frank Guinta voted for billions in cuts to veterans programs,"" a narrator declares in the ad, ""Debt,’ aired on WMUR-TV.

""I’m Carol Shea-Porter and I approve this message because our veterans deserve better,"" she said to conclude the ad.

Guinta, a freshman Republican, immediately disputed the ad and organized a rally in Manchester to call attention to his ""strong record of supporting our veterans.""

So, who’s right? We decided to check the records.

In the ad, the Shea-Porter campaign points to a number of bills, including H.R. 2055, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, as well as H. Con. Res. 112, the House Republicans’ budget resolution, to support their claim that Guinta voted to cut veterans funding.

We’ll look at each one individually.

The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill was first introduced May 31, 2011. In its original form, the bill proposed about $129.7 billion in funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs -- an increase of about $7.85 billion over the 2011 funding level.

In March 2011, the bill passed the House with near unanimous support. Guinta joined 410 other House lawmakers from both sides of the aisle passing the bill June 14, 2011 by a 411-5 count, according to Roll Call 418.

But, as it moved to the Senate, the legislation was expanded to include funding for a host of other federal programs and departments, including energy and water, financial services, interior and environment, labor and education, among others.

When it returned to the House for a vote Dec. 15, 2011, the final version of the bill, now known as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, proposed about $124.2 billion in funding for the Veterans Affairs department. This figure fell about $5.5 billion below the initial proposal, and $6 billion less than President Barack Obama’s $130.2 billion funding request. But it still exceeded the 2011 veterans figure, $123.16 billion, by nearly $1 billion -- $991 million, to be exact.

This time, however, Guinta voted against the bill, saying it failed to go far enough to reduce government spending. According to Roll Call 941, he was one of 86 Republicans to vote against the bill, which passed 296-121.

President Barack Obama signed the bill into law Dec. 23, 2011

""Americans simply can’t afford the high price-tag that accompanies this bill,"" Guinta said at the time in a written statement. ""While there are several provisions in it that I strongly support - and have voted for in the past - the overall spending level was just too high.""

So, in this case, Guinta initially voted to increase veterans funding, but then, when the legislation was expanded to include other spending, he voted against the bill. But voting against an increase isn’t the same as a vote to cut veterans funding.

Now, let’s move onto the House Republicans’ budget resolution. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House budget committee and the Republican vice-presidential nominee, first introduced the spending bill in March to set the budget for Fiscal Year 2013 and the budget projections for the nine years to follow.

On March 29, Guinta joined 227 of his fellow congressmen and women in supporting the budget, which passed the House 228-191, along party lines. But, the bill stalled as it moved on to the Democrat-controlled Senate, failing to reach the floor for a vote.

The bill Guinta supported set V.A. funding at $134.6 billion for Fiscal Year 2013. That total did not meet the president’s $139.7 billion request, but it exceeded 2012 spending by about $6.5 billion, or 4.9 percent.

But, White House officials and political analysts alike note the House Republicans’ budget also includes $798 billion in undefined cuts to discretionary spending. Neither Ryan nor other House Republicans have specified where these cuts would come from, leaving analysts to speculate about their impact.

Obama campaign officials note that, if applied evenly across the board, the budget could cost the V.A. $11 billion by 2014. And according to Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think thank, the department could lose $2 billion in 2013 and $117 billion over the next 10 years, if the cuts were applied proportionally by department.

""How much discretionary funding does Ryan propose for fiscal year 2013 or subsequent years for V.A. medical care?"" Kogan wrote in an e-mail. ""The answer is that we cannot tell, but it is at risk of cuts, perhaps deep cuts.

""Importantly, there are no cuts to veterans (specifically outlined) under this view of the budget. But the fact begs the question of where the remaining $897 billion in cuts will come from,"" he wrote.

Our ruling:

With $798 billion in unspecified cuts, the Ryan budget leaves many questions, including what effects those cuts will have on veterans spending. But, amid all the questions and uncertainties, what we do know is the budget plan, supported by Guinta, proposed to increase V.A. spending in 2013.

We also know that, contrary to Shea-Porter's claim, Guinta voted to increase the V.A. budget by $6 billion when he voted in favor of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs act last year. However, he ultimately voted against the measure when it returned to Congress in the form of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which added close to a $1 billion in new funding to veterans programs.

All things considered, we find it a distortion to say Guinta has voted to cut money for veterans’ programs. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B9B100>],/factchecks/2012/sep/27/carol-shea-porter/carol-shea-porter-distorts-frank-guintas-voting-re/

Do Measures 82 and 83 authorize just one new casino in Oregon?
","
In their campaign ad, ""Different,"" proponents of a new casino in Wood Village assure viewers that their proposal would not lead to a proliferation of gambling complexes in Oregon.

""There are nine casinos in Oregon today,"" the speaker says with words on screen to that effect. Ballot measures ""82 and 83 authorize just one more. The Grange in Wood Village.""

The Grange is a proposed $300 million entertainment complex at the old greyhound racing track in east Multnomah County. We wanted to know if the claim was accurate.

First of all, why are there two ballot measures? Let’s work backward, with the simpler measure first. Measure 83 sets the statutory parameters for the casino in Wood Village, including authority for up to 3,500 slot machines. This goes nowhere if Measure 82 is not approved.

Why? Because Oregon has a constitutional ban on any casinos not run by tribes. Measure 82 would delete that language to allow the Oregon Lottery to permit ""a taxpaying casino"" -- i.e. a nontribal casino -- only if certain conditions are met:
  
Voters authorize the casino by initiative petition. This is what these casino backers did, paying for circulators to collect enough signatures to put the measure on the ballot. Now voters statewide get to vote. 
The casino will be in an incorporated city, with residents in that city voting to approve the casino. Wood Village will vote on a local measure Nov. 6. 
The casino will be owned and operated by a corporation incorporated in Oregon. PDX Entertainment Company incorporated in March, according to the secretary of state’s office. 
The casino will not be within a 60-mile radius of a tribal casino operating on reservation land in Oregon as of January 2011. The Wood Village casino would be 75 miles away from the Grand Ronde’s Spirit Mountain Casino and 90 miles from the Warm Springs’ Indian Head Casino. 
And finally, the casino will pay 25 percent of adjusted gross revenue to the state for public schools. This casino proposes to do just that. 

Those are very specific criteria for a new casino in Oregon. Still, 82 does not put a limit on the number of new private casinos allowed, unlike in 2010 when the same investors tried to change the constitution to allow only their casino. This time, if investors want to open a casino in, say  Cascade Locks, they could, provided they go through another round of statewide and local elections.

(And just so you know, in 2010, the measure changing the Constitution to allow one casino never made it to the ballot. The companion measure authorizing the Wood Village casino in statute did make it on the ballot and was defeated, two-to-one.)

Stacey Dycus, spokeswoman for the Yes on 82 and 83 campaign, said they’re not trying to hide the ball. The ad, she said, was largely in response to remarks by people opposed to the Wood Village casino, including Justin Martin, a lobbyist for the Grand Ronde tribe, which runs the very successful Spirit Mountain Casino.

""Once you knock out the barrier of the Constitution, what's to prevent the Legislature, or the next wealthy executive, from putting one between Salem and Eugene?"" he told The Oregonian last month.  (Well, as we spelled out above, lawmakers can’t put one on the ballot, Salem is too close to Spirit Mountain Casino; a spot somewhere south of Salem and north of Eugene may qualify for a casino, if backers go through the steps outlined above.)

""We thought that was creating confusion and that people thought that there might be a misconception,"" Dycus said. ""We’re attempting to run a very fact-driven campaign, to give Oregonians all the information they need to make a choice. And after 83 and 82 pass, there will be just a 10th casino.""

(In response to Dycus’s response, the spokeswoman for the other side said ""the larger issue at stake is whether or not Oregonians want to fundamentally change how gambling is managed in Oregon and allow for multiple private-casinos around the state."" Fair enough all around.)

But PolitiFact Oregon doesn’t care so much about the campaign insiders. We care about the casual viewer who comes across the ad and asks: Would this create just one new casino?

To that, we say, yes, it would create one new casino. But we’d be remiss if we didn’t tell the viewer that one of the two ballot measures changes the constitution to allow the possibility of more in the future. That detail is important. The Constitution has been amended numerous times, but it’s still the Constitution.

We rate the statement Half True -- partially accurate, missing an important detail -- and reserve the right to fact check Martin’s statement in the future.

"['National', 'Debt', 'Deficit', 'Economy', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama says he's responsible for just 10 percent of budget shortfalls
","
In an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes that aired on Sept. 23, 2012, President Barack Obama blamed the Bush administration for much of the nation's recent debt.

""Over the last four years, the deficit has gone up, but 90 percent of that is as a consequence of two wars that weren’t paid for, as a consequence of tax cuts that weren’t paid for, a prescription drug plan that was not paid for, and then the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,"" Obama said. ""Now we took some emergency actions, but that accounts for about 10 percent of this increase in the deficit.""

When we asked the Obama campaign for documentation, they pointed to calculations by the Treasury Department, based on data from the Congressional Budget Office. CBO is an independent congressional agency, but the Treasury Department is part of the Obama administration, so we need to look closely to see whether Treasury is interpreting CBO’s data fairly and accurately.

To figure out what caused the accumulation of deficits over the past decade, CBO tracked the surplus it had projected back in 2001 and compared it to the actual cumulative deficits that resulted instead. Between 2002 and 2011, the government was projected to run a cumulative surplus of $5.6 trillion. Instead, the government ran a cumulative deficit of $6.1 trillion. That’s a swing of about $11.7 trillion.

We combined the CBO data into four broad categories, which broke down like this:

* About 37 percent of the swing came from higher spending
* About 24 percent from tax cuts
* About 12 percent from increases in interest costs
* About 27 percent from CBO’s failures to predict economic conditions accurately.

Obama's Treasury Department took CBO’s detailed, bill-by-bill calculations and assigned some of those laws to Bush and some of those laws to Obama. When Treasury did this, it found that 29 percent of the cumulative shortfall came from CBO forecasting problems, 59 percent of the shortfall came from Bush administration policies and only 12 percent from Obama administration policies. That’s where Obama’s claim comes from -- roughly 10 percent due to himself, and 90 percent due to either Bush or an economy so bad that CBO was unable to predict it.

However, we see two problems with this methodology. We’ll take them in order.

""Over the last four years""

On 60 Minutes, Obama said his 90-10 split referred to ""the last four years."" But that claim is a stretch at best if you’re using the Treasury document. Its percentages refer to the cumulative deficit swing over a 10-year period between January 2001 and August 2011.

We can calculate a more appropriate number using the original CBO data. We’ll use three years -- 2009, 2010, and 2011 -- because those are the years that reflect Obama’s presidency. (Data for 2012 isn’t available yet.)

Over this period, 38 percent of the swing comes from spending, 20 percent from tax cuts, 14 percent from interest increases and 28 percent from faulty CBO projections. Using Obama’s strict definition of what laws count as ""Bush’s"" and ""Obama’s,"" about 17 percent of this swing is attributable to Obama, not 10 percent.

What should count as ""Bush’s"" and ""Obama’s""?

The bigger problem with Obama’s figure, though, is in what he blames on Bush.

Obama in the interview mentioned the big-ticket ""Bush"" programs -- the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the Medicare prescription drug program. The total by his Treasury department also includes other laws, such as the 2008 Bush stimulus package, which Obama supported as a senator. Meanwhile, Obama claims as his own the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the stimulus), TARP and the tax act of 2010.

However, this division seems unduly generous toward Obama because it includes policies he supports, or has supported. Obama has said he intends to keep the Bush tax cuts for Americans earning under $200,000, which accounts for a significant chunk of the cost. If he supports the policy, he shouldn’t be able to fob off 100 percent of the responsibility on his predecessor.

The same goes for the Medicare drug program -- a program Obama not only supports but actually expanded in his health care bill. Even the responsibility for the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan are more nuanced than Obama’s formulation makes it. While Obama didn’t start the wars, he did make policy decisions that wound down one war (Iraq) and extended, at least temporarily, another (Afghanistan).

We won’t venture a guess as to the actual percentage; CBO in its report acknowledges that its own numbers are ""only a very rough approximation of how changes since January 2001 have contributed to the swing from projected surpluses to a string of annual deficits over the 2002-2011 period and should not be interpreted as precise tracking of all the components of that cumulative change over the past decade.""

Still, even our revised starting point of 17 percent is higher than Obama’s 10 percent. And it would rise much higher if Obama were to take some responsibility for the Bush tax cuts, the Medicare drug program and the wars, as we believe he should. (The Washington Post Fact Checker gave Obama's claim four Pinocchios, its lowest rating.) 
Our ruling

Obama said that ""over the last four years, the deficit has gone up, but 90 percent of that is as a consequence of"" President George W. Bush’s policies and the effects of the recession.

But Obama misstated his own documentation by using four years rather than the 10 that were included in the analysis. At a minimum, that makes him responsible for at least 17 percent. But more importantly, he engages in significant cherry-picking by assigning pricey programs to Bush’s column while ignoring the fact that he supported, or supports, many of them.

Ad claims Obama will ‘force doctors to assist homosexuals in buying surrogate babies’
","
A fact-challenged newspaper ad attacking President Barack Obama addresses some standard wedge issues: same-sex marriage, illegal immigration, Islamic law.

Then there’s this claim: ""Barack Hussein Obama will move America to force doctors to assist homosexuals in buying surrogate babies.""

It’s one of those statements that’s so far outside reality, our experts wondered where to start.

William Murray, chairman of the political action committee that says it placed the ad in 19 papers in three states, said it predicted ""what we believe Obama will do in a second term.""

But even predictions require some connection to the way the world works.

This fails that test.

 ‘Outrageous,’ ‘imaginary,’ ‘fevered dream’

Volunteers for Murray’s Government Is Not God PAC put together support for the ad’s claims, which they sent to us. The evidence? That Obama supports adoption by same-sex couples and extended benefits to same-sex domestic partners of federal employees.

But that didn't come close to proving the claim. The links don’t address: a) doctors b) surrogacy c) buying babies.

Nor do they address whether Obama would be interested in such an action. And a group that lobbies for equal treatment of gays and lesbians hasn’t seen any such evidence.

""We cannot find any remotely related action or statement by the president or his administration that would lead anyone to such an outrageous conclusion,"" said Brian Moulton, legal director for the Human Rights Campaign.

Experts in surrogacy from a medical perspective had a similar reaction.

""We have no idea what this claim is based on,"" said Eleanor Nicoll, public affairs manager for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

But even if Obama were interested, he would find a nearly impossible task (short of, say, suspending the rule of law).

Whether surrogacy is legal is a matter of state law, not federal. In the District of Columbia, for example, attorneys could serve jail time for helping write a contract between prospective parents and a woman who wants to carry their child. In other states, surrogacy varies from perfectly legal to functionally impossible, according to a summary of state regulation from Maryland law firm Creative Family Connections.

Michael Tanner, an expert in health care policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, pointed out that even if the Obama administration managed to require non-discriminatory coverage for artificial reproductive technology in its health care law, doctors don’t have to accept insurance, and they don’t have to perform procedures.

""They can't supersede the surrogacy laws. They can't force physicians,"" he said. ""... That has got to be the most bizarre claim I have ever seen in my life.""

He called it ""a fevered dream.""

Jonathan Rauch, author of Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America, and a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution told us, ""Even a sane version of this claim is imaginary.""

 Our ruling

A newspaper ad claimed that ""Barack Hussein Obama will … force doctors to assist homosexuals in buying surrogate babies."" There’s no evidence Obama is interested in such a requirement. But even if he were, surrogacy laws vary by state and there’s no mechanism to force doctors to perform a procedure. Experts found this claim ""outrageous,"" ""imaginary,"" and a ""fevered dream."" We find it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097173680>],/factchecks/2012/sep/27/government-not-god-pac/ad-claims-obama-will-force-doctors-assist-homosexu/
