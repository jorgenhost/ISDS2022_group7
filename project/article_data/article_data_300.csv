Bill Nelson says Connie Mack's Penny Plan would lead to massive cuts in defense, Medicare and Social Security
","
U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, says his plan to balance the federal budget is so simple it comes down to a penny.

But Mack’s Senate rival, Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, said that the Penny Plan would lead to massive cuts in entitlements and defense.

""He has a Penny Plan that would absolutely eviscerate Medicare and Social Security,"" Nelson said during an Oct. 17 debate at Nova Southeastern University in Davie. ""Over $200 billion out of Medicare. Over a trillion out of Social Security. And we are going to release tonight the impartial nonpartisan Congressional Research Service study that shows how he absolutely savages Medicare, Social Security and oh by the way to boot ... $3 trillion out of defense. That is what his Penny Plan is.""

We wanted to check to see if Nelson accurately characterized the impact of Mack’s Penny Plan on Medicare, Social Security and defense.

We’ve looked at Mack’s Penny Plan before when Mack said his plan ""would balance our budget by 2019"" and ""continues to gain support."" We rated that claim Half True.You can read that check for a longer analysis of the Penny Plan, but we will include the highlights here.

By the numbers

Mack got the idea for H.R. 1848, the One Percent Spending Reduction Act from the One Cent Solution. The founder, Bruce Cook, is a businessman from Georgia and a graduate of Harvard Business School. The One Cent Solution even has a rap to promote its message.

The math works like this: For six years, the federal government would reduce spending by 1 percent each year. In the seventh year, funding would be capped at 18 percent of gross domestic product, which measures the size of the overall economy. By the eighth year, the plan would balance the budget and save $7.5 trillion over 10 years.

If Congress and the president couldn’t reach an agreement about what to cut, the plan would trigger automatic across-the-board spending cuts.

A mailer Mack sent this year stated the plan would balance the budget by 2019, while a Mack congressional staffer told us based on the latest figures it would do the trick by 2017.

To give you an idea of how dramatic this is, Paul Ryan’s budget plan wouldn’t balance the budget for nearly three decades, until 2040.

Mack introduced his bill in the House on May 11, 2011. It was referred to committees and introduced in the Senate on June 30. Since then, it has seen no official action.

Experts said Mack’s math was right, but plan avoids the tough questions

Earlier this year, we asked several federal budget experts from across the political spectrum about Mack’s Penny Plan.  They generally agreed that Mack’s math is correct and would balance the budget. But they said the challenge is how do you get there: Do you cut everything by 1 percent or cut some more than others? Mack’s plan lacks that specific guidance other than saying that would be in the hands of lawmakers and the president to sort out.

""The numbers work, but they have to be made effective by policy changes,""  said J.D. Foster of the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""The easiest part legislatively is the targets, and you have to have those, but then you still need to finish the job.""

Most notably, the bill doesn’t explain how it would adjust Medicare and Social Security to make up for the expected growth as Baby Boomers retire.

We asked Mack’s congressional office if Mack supports cutting peoples’ Social Security 1 percent a year for six years. Their statement:

""The Penny Plan sets a framework for reducing spending. It will be up to Congress and the president to work together to determine how best to achieve those spending reductions.""

Michael Linden, of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, called Mack’s plan ""ridiculous."" He noted that the plan could mean an even larger cut than 1 percent for each senior, since the number of seniors getting Social Security will increase. And if Social Security and Medicare were off the table, that would remove about 35 percent of non-interest spending from the chopping block, leaving bigger cuts elsewhere.

CRS study

After we published that fact-check, U.S. Sen. Bernard Sanders, an independent from Vermont, asked the Congressional Research Service to analyze the impact of Mack’s Penny Plan on Medicare and Social Security. The Oct. 4, 2012,  report explained that the plan would establish caps on federal outlays, and enforce those caps through a sequestration process which can force automatic cuts if lawmakers can’t reach an agreement. The report laid out in detail how those cuts would be applied if they were implemented across all programs.

The bottom line, according to the report: Mack’s plan would lead to about $2.89 trillion in defense cuts and $2.89 trillion in non-defense programs between 2013-22. The cuts would include about $211 billion for Medicare and about $1.124 billion for Social Security.

 Experts weigh in on CRS study

We sent Nelson’s claim and the study to several experts including Jason Peuquet of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget; Alan Viard, resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute; and Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.

Viard told us in an email that it appears the Congressional Research Service correctly outlined how sequestration would work. Still, Congress and the president could avoid the amount of the cuts cited by Nelson if they agree to larger spending cuts elsewhere.

But no matter how you slice it, to achieve the bill’s spending caps would ""require gigantic reductions in federal spending, relative to the baseline,"" he wrote. ""There is no prospect that cuts of this magnitude could ever be adopted.""

Peuquet reached a similar conclusion: ""There is no doubt this plan would put into place pretty large reductions in spending across across the board to control the deficit and debt.""

The Mack campaign said the CRS findings were just ""one opinion"" and reiterated their previous claims that the plan would work to reduce federal spending.

The campaign also highlighted one sentence from our earlier fact-check: ""Our experts generally agreed that Mack’s math is correct and would balance the budget.""

Our ruling

Nelson said during the debate that Connie Mack’s Penny Plan would cut more than $200 billion in Medicare, $1 trillion in Social Security and $3 trillion in defense.

Nelson relied on a study from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. It found that Mack’s plan, if implemented across all programs, would cut $211 billion in Medicare, $1.124 trillion in Social Security and $2.89 trillion in defense. During the debate Nelson didn’t mention the timeframe for those cuts: 2013-2022, as mentioned in the study.

The study makes some assumptions and is based on current economic projections. The reductions to Medicare, Social Security and defense might not ultimately occur if Congress and the president could agree to other specific cuts. But we will repeat what our expert from the conservative organization said: ""Any method of meeting the bill’s spending caps would require gigantic reductions in federal spending, relative to the baseline. There is no prospect that cuts of this magnitude could ever be adopted.""

Nelson’s claim requires some explanation about the plan and its timeline, but his numbers are correct. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809708A4C0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/24/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-connie-macks-penny-plan-would-lea/

Tim Kaine says he cut $5 billion in spending as governor
","
Democrat Tim Kaine says he knows how to cut budgets, and that will be helpful if he’s elected to the U.S. Senate this fall.

""As governor, I cut $5 billion in spending,"" Kaine says in opening words of a TV commercial that began airing Oct. 8.

That same day, Kaine boasted of his budget prowess in his opening comments of a debate with Republican George Allen. ""I was the governor that drew a tough, tough straw,"" he said. ""I was governor during the worst recession since the 1930s and I had to cut $5 billion from the state budget.""

Did Kaine really cut state spending by $5 billion? We took a look.

Kaine says the reductions were made in the general fund, the portion of the state budget that pays for schools, health programs and public safety. It is largely funded by income taxes and sales taxes.

When Kaine took office in January 2006, he inherited a general fund budget of $15.1 billion for the fiscal year that started July 1, 2005. The economy was healthy at the start of his term and the general fund for the budget year that started in July 2007 was pegged at $17 billion.

But trouble began that October when the nation began sliding into recession. Kaine announced there was a $300 million shortfall in tax revenues needed to pay for general fund programs and took steps to balance the budget, as required by law.

By the time he left office in January 2010, Kaine and the General Assembly had filled in cumulative budget holes totaling about $7.28 billion, according state documents from the final three years of his administration. About 85 percent of the shortfall was caused by dwindling tax receipts; the rest was caused by increased expenses, mainly in providing Medicaid.

Kaine and the General Assembly closed the gap by drawing on emergency funds, transferring state funds, using bookkeeping techniques and cutting programs.

There’s no single document that lists each action Kaine and legislators took to balance the general fund. But a solid summary can be constructed by piecing together figures contained in a variety of reports issued by the General Assembly’s money committees, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission and the Kaine administration.

Actions approved during Kaine’s term

How did Kaine and the General Assembly balance the $7.34 billion in general fund shortfalls? For starters, they made about $4.03 billion in budget adjustments that did not require cuts in spending.

*They used $1.5 billion in federal stimulus money to pay for programs.

*They withdrew $895 million in emergency reserves from the state’s Rainy Day Fund.

*They found $525 million in short-term savings by switching the financing on some construction projects from cash to bonds.

*They wiped $240 million off the books by rescinding a 2 percent raise for state employees and teachers before it went into effect in 2008.

*They transferred $244 million into the general fund from other state accounts.

*They collected $234 million in unspent money in state accounts at the end of budget years.  

*They gained $171 million by changing tax and fee policies.

*They saved $133 million by delaying the reimbursement of Medicaid providers.

*They saved $93 million by changing business practices, such as delaying purchases.

As we noted, these steps erased about $4.03 billion of the shortfall without imposing spending cuts. That leaves about a $3.31 billion portion of the shortfall that was eliminated with cuts to general fund programs.

So how does Kaine get to $5 billion in cuts?

Kaine’s farewell budget

During the final weeks of his term in late 2009, Kaine confronted an additional $4.2 billion shortfall facing the state for the fiscal year starting the following July 1.

On Dec. 18, 2009, Kaine proposed an outgoing budget with steps to balance the future shortfall. He called for a $1.9 billion tax hike and $2.3 billion in other budget-balancing steps. Kaine left office four weeks later, before the General Assembly took up his proposals.

Lawmakers eventually rejected the tax hike. Brandi Hoffine, a spokeswoman for Kaine, said the General Assembly embraced the rest of Kaine’s plan and the campaign adds its entire $2.3 billion impact to Kaine’s tally of cuts -- pushing him well above a $5 billion total.

But a different picture emerges from documents issued by the General Assembly’s money committees in January and June of 2010. They show that the $2.3 billion portion of Kaine’s plan included $660 million in adjustments that did not require general fund cuts; half it coming from an additional draw on federal stimulus funds and half coming from increased fees and transfers from other state accounts.

That leaves us with about $1.64 billion in spending cuts proposed by Kaine and, of them, the General Assembly adopted about $1.33 billion worth.

Our rating

Kaine said, ""As governor, I cut $5 billion in spending.""

As governor, Kaine approved about $3.31 billion in general fund spending cuts. After he left office, the General Assembly adopted additional budget cuts recommended by Kaine totaling about $1.33 billion. If we count everything, we come to about $4.64 billion.    

Should Kaine receive some credit for cuts that he recommended but were enacted after he left office? We think so. But the actual spending cuts still fall short of $5 billion.

We rate Kaine’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4F3040>],/factchecks/2012/oct/24/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-he-cut-5-billion-spending-governor/

Tommy Thompson says Senate foe Tammy Baldwin backs $3,000 tax hike on middle class
","
A signature slogan of Tammy Baldwin’s campaign is that she is a fighter for the middle class.

Yet her U.S. Senate opponent, Tommy Thompson, claims Baldwin wants to stick it to average folks.

And he uses President Barack Obama to back his attack.

In a Thompson TV ad releasedOct. 8, 2012, the narrator says:

""Baldwin supports a massive middle-class tax increase that President Obama says would be devastating.""

Then the ad shows a clip of Obama saying: ""If that had come to pass, the average middle-class family would have had to pay an extra $3,000 in taxes next year.""

Thompson’s case

Thompson’s claim starts off on the wrong foot in that he uses the present tense -- ""Baldwin supports"" a middle-class tax increase. But his campaign told us he was referring to a vote Baldwin cast in December 2010, and it’s clear from the ad that the reference is to a measure Obama commented on.

The vote was on a compromise Obama reached with Congress over taxes. The compromise involved a number of things, including a cut in the employee portion of payroll taxes and an extension of unemployment benefits.

But the big fight was over what to do about tax cuts -- on income, capital gains, dividends and business -- that were about to expire.

Republicans wanted to permanently extend the cuts, adopted under President George W. Bush, for all Americans. Obama and Baldwin were among Democrats who wanted to extend the cuts for most Americans, but let them expire for wealthier people -- individuals making more than $200,000 and joint tax filers making more than $250,000 in adjusted gross income. 
That’s a key point -- Baldwin’s aim was to extend the tax cuts for the middle class, not raise taxes on the middle class. 
With the compromise, the tax cuts were extended for all Americans, for two years. The measure passed the House, 277-148, with Baldwin voting no. She said giving ""a special tax break to those with incomes over $250,000"" would have added to the national debt and was fiscally irresponsible.

As for the Thompson ad’s use of the Obama clip, the president was saying that had all the Bush-era tax cuts been allowed to expire, the average middle-class family would have had to pay an extra $3,000 in taxes in 2011.

Obama may have been rounding up a figure generated by the Deloitte Tax consulting firm. It estimated that letting the tax cuts expire would have meant that atypical family of four with a household income of $50,000 a year would have to pay $2,900 more in taxes in 2011.

So, if Baldwin’s side had succeeded in defeating the compromise, middle-class taxes would have risen about $3,000 -- if no other action had been taken.

On the other hand, Baldwin made it clear she supported extending the tax cuts for middle-class families. A week before the vote on the compromise, she voted for an alternative that would have extended the Bush tax cuts permanently for families earning less than $250,000.

So, in the way Thompson frames the issue, it could be said Baldwin opposes -- or supports -- extending tax cuts for the middle class, depending on which vote you consider.

Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus noted that Baldwin voted again in 2012 for a one-year extension of most of the Bush tax cuts for the middle class but not for wealthier people. That measure failed.

Our rating

Thompson said Baldwin supports a ""tax increase that President Obama says"" would cost families $3,000 per year.

Thompson falters in making the claim in the present tense when he’s referring to a vote Baldwin took in 2010.

Baldwin did vote no on a law that prevented middle class taxes from increasing by $3,000. But she supported extending tax cuts for the middle class and she voted for a another measure, which failed, that also would have prevented the $3,000 middle-class tax hike.

We rate Thompson’s statement Mostly False.

"['New Jersey', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Joseph Kyrillos']","
Chris Christie was trailing Jon Corzine in the polls during the 2009 governor’s race, Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Joe Kyrillos says
","
Republican U.S. Senate candidate Joe Kyrillos has much in common with his Republican governor, but when it comes to polling against a Democratic incumbent in a statewide race, Kyrillos is no Chris Christie.

Trailing Democratic U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez by double-digits in recent polls, Kyrillos recently argued that Christie also was behind in the polls against Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine during their 2009 matchup.

""Public polls had, had, had Chris behind as well, and, and I know that they’re close because I’m with people each and every day,"" Kyrillos, a state senator, said during an Oct. 15 campaign stop with Christie.

But most of the polls leading up to the 2009 election indicated that the race was roughly even between Christie and Corzine.

Christie was leading in some polls and Corzine led in others, but those leads were typically minimal and fell within the polls’ margins of error. That’s very different from how Menendez has been outperforming Kyrillos in polls as the two prepare for the Nov. 6 election.

In a statement, Chapin Fay, Kyrillos’ campaign manager, told us: ""This is silly. Fact: public polls had Christie behind. That is what Kyrillos said. Your opinion that he wasn't behind enough does not change the fact that polls had Christie behind.""

Let’s break down those poll figures.

To analyze Kyrillos’ claim, PolitiFact New Jersey reviewed the results of 15 polls released between September 2009 and November 2009.

In five of those polls, Corzine held leads within the margins of error, and Christie’s leads were within the margins of error in four polls. Another poll had them tied. Christie held leads greater than the sampling errors in four polls, and Corzine had such a lead in one poll.

As the polls indicate, Christie held significant leads over Corzine in early September, but the race became much tighter in its final weeks. Chris Daggett, an independent candidate for governor, trailed Christie and Corzine by wide margins in each poll.

By mid-October, Christie’s lead had shrunk to 1 percent among likely voters, with a margin of error of 2.8 percent, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Oct. 14.

With the same margin of error, Corzine took a five-point lead among likely voters in a Quinnipiac poll released on Oct. 28. But less than a week later, Christie was beating Corzine by 2 percent among likely voters in another Quinnipiac poll, with a sampling error of 2.5 percent.

Polls conducted by the Monmouth University Polling Institute also presented a close race.

A poll released on Oct. 20 had Christie and Corzine in a dead heat at 39 percent each among likely voters. In two subsequent Monmouth polls, Christie held a slight lead among likely voters in the first and Corzine had a minimal lead in the second, but both leads fell within the polls’ margins of error.

Polls conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University’s PublicMind put Corzine ahead of Christie going into the election, but Corzine’s leads still fell within the polls’ margins of error.

For example, in PublicMind polls released on Oct. 6 and Oct. 30, Corzine held a 1-point lead over Christie among likely voters, 44 percent to 43 percent, but the margins of error were 4 percent each time. 
The chart below outlines how Corzine and Christie performed among likely voters in those 15 polls. The ten polls listed in bold represent cases where the candidates’ leads were within the margins of error or they were tied. 
  
So, among those 15 polls, Corzine’s lead over Christie ranged from 1 percent to 5 percent -- far from the double-digit leads held by Menendez over Kyrillos.

In a Monmouth poll released on Sept. 25, 2012, 49 percent of likely voters supported Menendez, compared to 34 percent for Kyrillos. A PublicMind poll released on Sept. 20 gave Menendez a 14-point advantage over Kyrillos among likely voters, 50 percent to 36 percent.

 Our ruling

At a recent campaign stop, Kyrillos compared his polling against Menendez to how Christie was behind Corzine in polls during the 2009 governor’s race.

But while Kyrillos has been trailing Menendez by double digits, most of the polls leading up to the 2009 election suggested a close race between Christie and Corzine. When Corzine held an advantage over Christie, his leads typically fell within the polls’ margins of error.

Since Christie was behind in some polls, we rate the statement Mostly False.

DCCC says Jim Renacci voted against combat bonuses for troops
","
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives, has released a series of localized TV ads attacking incumbent congressional Republicans as self-serving pols who opposed pay for U.S. troops.

One of the targeted incumbents is Jim Renacci, who faces another incumbent, Democrat Betty Sutton, in the newly drawn 16th Congressional District.

The ad aimed at him, narrated by a Northeast Ohio veteran of Operation Desert Storm, mingles black-and-white footage of combat troops with shots of Renacci.

""Renacci tried to skip out on paying over a million in taxes,"" the narrator says, ""but opposed increasing combat bonuses for our troops.

""And when Congressman Renacci wants to place tax cuts for himself and his rich friends, and take away veterans services for those serving in country and out of country, I think it's an atrocity.""

PolitiFact Ohio rated as True a claim from the Sutton camp about Renacci trying to avoid taxes. For this fact check, we’ll look at the claim that Renacci ""opposed increasing combat bonuses for our troops.""

The DCCC cites a vote in a footnote at the bottom of the screen in support of the claim, but that footnote doesn’t tell the whole story.

Not even close.

As our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin noted, that vote -- and others cited by the DCCC in other ads -- come from spring 2011, when an extended partisan tussle over spending cuts brought the federal government close to a shutdown. One of the sticky issues was how to deal with congressional pay and military pay if a shutdown occurred. There was plenty of maneuvering for partisan advantage and both parties claimed they were on the side of the troops.

On May 26, 2011 -- after the funding crisis was averted with passage of a bill with military appropriations through the remainder of fiscal 2011 -- the House debated a defense authorization bill for the following year, 2012.

Democrats called for a vote on a motion to boost pay for combat troops.

U.S. Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, called it transparently political: ""We had all kinds of time to bring an amendment that would be helpful like this, then they bring this one. There's no offset. This would just put us again above the allocation from the chairman. This is really more Democrat increasing spending.""

The motion failed, with Renacci in opposition.

What the DCCC ad doesn’t say is that the full bill -- supported by Renacci, nearly all Republicans and 95 Democrats, including Betty Sutton -- already included a pay hike of 1.6 percent in the monthly basic pay for members of the uniformed services. That covered combat troops as well.

So, Renacci didn’t vote for the additional bump proposed at the very end of the process, but he voted -- the same day -- for the increased pay level in the underlying bill.

Think of it this way: There is a bill to increase spending by $500,000 for a particular program. An amendment is offered to increase it to $750,000. If a person votes against the amendment but for the bill, are they ""voting against an increase in spending"" for the program?

We also note that the Democratic amendment in question, like the others cited by the DCCC, was a ""motion to recommit,"" a prerogative of the minority party since the first Congress. They are motions, partly procedural, that attempt to send a bill back to committee just before passage.

""Both parties, when in the minority, have used these to make political statements and embarrass the majority for partisan advantage,"" said Donald Wolfensberger, an expert on parliamentary rules who was a key Republican staffer for the House Rules Committee in the 1990s. ""It is well understood in modern times that these are designed for partisan campaign purposes and usually have little to do with better policy.""

Both parties, when in the minority, contend the motions can have merit and are not purely procedural.

What is the merit of the Democratic TV ad charging that Renacci ""opposed increasing combat bonuses for our troops""?

The claim is based on Renacci’s vote on a ""motion to recommit"" that preceded a final vote on military pay. Such motions are routinely denied by the majority party as procedural moves. That gives the minority party the chance to structure them for partisan advantage.

That’s what is playing out in the ad now.

Did Carl Hosticka propose a 'windfall' tax on property?
","
Oregon House Republicans have sent a mailer in District 37, claiming that Democrat Carl Hosticka has been trying to raise voters’ taxes for two dozen years. Hosticka is a Metro councilor from Tualatin running against freshman Rep. Julie Parrish, R-West Linn.

The mailer lists two ways Hosticka supposedly tried to squeeze more money out of the public, including this: ""Carl proposed a ‘windfall’ tax on real estate development when he was a Metro Councilor.""

Hosticka requested a fact check, saying he didn’t propose the tax. We obliged, as we did when Parrish asked for one on a statement that sounded interesting.

First, we need to remind readers of Measure 37, a contentious land-use and property rights ballot proposal that voters approved in 2004. Property owners had complained for years that under Oregon’s strict land-use regulations, they could do little with their land — like sell to developers — and were losing money. The passage of Measure 37 required government to compensate owners for the loss of land value, or waive the regulations.

In November 2005, the Metro Council created six policy committees and divided them among the councilors. One committee, created in response to a proposal by an earlier Measure 37 task force, dealt with the possibility of levying a tax on land that appreciates in value when brought into the urban growth boundary — the ""windfall"" — to pay for farmland protection and infrastructure.

Robert Liberty, also a Metro councilor, took the lead. Hosticka was named as a council liaison, a deputy if you will.

The ""Fair Growth and Farmlands Project Committee"" was made up of Realtors, business people and government officials. In April 2006, the committee reported its recommendations for proceeding — if the Metro Council should choose to pursue a windfall tax. Voters should get a chance to weigh in, the report said, and the first 100 percent of profit should be exempt from tax.

The Council voted unanimously to budget money to study the issue, but the tax went nowhere.

As evidence for the mailer, House Republicans provide a 2006 legal article written by Liberty and an April 2006 news article from The Oregonian.

In the legal article, Liberty describes how the windfall tax committee came to be, and named himself and Hosticka as project leaders. The news article describes Liberty and Hosticka as initiating the project.

Hosticka ""was supportive of the concept,"" says Nick Smith, spokesman for House Republicans’ political action committee.

""In our research, it’s pretty clear that he, along with Liberty, were behind a windfall profits tax on real estate values, and just because the council didn’t move forward and actually implement it doesn’t mean that his fingerprints were not on it.""

Clearly, Liberty was in favor of the idea. Hosticka, however, tells PolitiFact Oregon he was more non-committal.

""I remember that Robert Liberty was talking a lot about it, and that conceptually it could make sense,"" Hosticka says. ""But that in terms of practicality, there was no real way of designing anything that would make sense, and politically there was no chance, so there was no reason to go forward.""

We caught up with Liberty, who proudly claimed ownership of the windfall tax.

""That was my project and my proposal that we look at a windfall tax. That was something I led; that was not Carl’s,"" said Liberty. ""I still think it’s a good idea, and I still think it’s a logical way to pay for infrastructure.""

We also talked with Tom Linhares, executive director of the Multnomah County Tax Supervising & Conservation Commission. He served on the tax mechanism subcommittee and admits being fuzzy on the details, but his recollection is committee members knew the tax would not get far.

""It was really Robert’s show,"" Linhares said. ""It was something he was passionate about. That was my sense, as I remember it. ‘Well, let’s put this together, but don’t hold your breath because council’s not going to adopt it.’""  

In the plain meaning of words, PolitiFact Oregon doesn’t think Hosticka proposed a windfall tax on real estate development.

To us, proposing an idea indicates a major degree of ownership by a public official or staff. In this case, the idea of a tax came from a task force that went to a Metro committee formally led by Liberty, who championed it. If anything, it’s fair to say Liberty proposed it.

That’s not to say Hosticka shouldn’t be held responsible for his actions while on the committee. He supported the idea of exploring a taxing option, and he probably would have backed a proposed tax had it gone anywhere.

Hosticka was tapped to help lead a large civic committee that eventually recommended ideas for a windfall tax. That’s the element of truth. But to state that this was Hosticka’s idea, one that he or his staff proposed and pursued, ignores the critical facts of Liberty’s advocacy as well as all the other members on the committee who agreed to make the recommendation to Metro.

We rate this Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097807380>],/factchecks/2012/oct/24/promote-oregon-leadership-pac-oregon-house-republi/did-carl-hosticka-propose-windfall-tax-property/

Obama claims Romney said ""we should ask Pakistan for permission"" to take out Osama bin Laden
","
In an attempt to portray Mitt Romney as ""all over the map"" on foreign policy, President Barack Obama said the candidate once argued that the United States ""should ask Pakistan for permission"" to strike Osama bin Laden.

""When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call,"" Obama said at the debate in Boca Raton, Fla. ""But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man. And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission. And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him. And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.""

We’ve previously rated an Obama claim that Romney’s view on killing bin Laden was ""it's not worth moving heaven and earth."" We found it Half True. While Romney used those words, he also explained that he wanted to see a broader focus against the ""worldwide jihadist effort,"" not just the al-Qaida leader.

In this fact-check, we’re asking whether Romney once said ""we should ask Pakistan for permission"" to strike if bin Laden was in reach.

 ‘We keep our options quiet’

Obama approved the May 2, 2011, strike that killed the terrorist  mastermind in his compound in Pakistan.

The secret, unilateral Navy SEALS mission followed through on a 2007 Obama campaign promise: ""If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President (Pervez) Musharraf won't act, we will.""

Obama’s words attracted criticism from his Democratic and Republican opponents at the time — including Romney.

The Republican primary candidate told reporters in Iowa in August 2007 that Obama’s comments were ""ill-timed and ill-considered."" 
A Romney campaign news release in December 2007 said, ""Sen. Obama Recently Suggested Attacking Inside Pakistan Without Pakistani Approval.""

Romney didn’t explicitly say that he would ask for permission to strike inside the country.

Rather, he said he wanted to ""participate with other nations,"" to fight terrorism and criticized Obama for saying he would attack ""without Pakistani approval.""

And there’s a bit more to the story.

At the Aug. 5, 2007, Republican debate in Iowa, moderator George Stephanopoulos asked Romney to explain his reaction to Obama’s pledge.

""I think Barack Obama is confused as to who are our friends and who are our enemies,"" Romney said. ""... He says he wants to unilaterally go in and potentially bomb a nation which is our friend.""

Stephanopoulos pushed for details: ""But if your CIA director called you and said we have Osama bin Laden in our sights, Musharraf says no. What do you do?""

Romney responded: 
Stephanopoulos clarified: ""So ... what I'm hearing is you keep this option on the table, but it was foolish to talk about it in public. Does anybody disagree with that?""

A transcript shows former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson speaking up — but not Romney.

 Our ruling

Obama claimed that during the 2008 campaign, Romney said, ""we should ask Pakistan for permission"" to take out bin Laden. The reality is somewhat more complex.

Romney did express a preference for working with the Pakistanis, and he attacked Obama for saying he would strike if Musharraf wouldn’t.

But Romney’s clearest objection was to Obama saying the United States would attack inside Pakistan without approval — not to the option itself. ""We keep our options quiet,"" he said.

Mitt Romney says Barack Obama was silent about the protests after the 2009 Iran election
","
While much of the foreign policy debate was about what President Barack Obama has said and done, Mitt Romney leveled a charge about an area where he said Obama had been silent.

""And then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake,"" Romney said during the Oct. 22 foreign policy debate at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla.

Later in the debate, Obama responded: ""And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for.""

Romney was referring to the protests that followed the June 13, 2009, re-election of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. We will fact-check Romney’s claim that Obama was ""silent"" when the protests happened after that election.

After Ahmadinejad won, supporters of opponent Mir Hossein Mousavi ""burned dumpsters, threw stones and clashed with police in the worst rioting in Tehran in many years,"" the Washington Post reported. It was the largest protest since the 1979 revolution and hundreds of thousands poured into the streets. The government cracked down on the protesters -- Amnesty International wrote a few months later that thousands were arrested after the elections and that dozens were killed.

Both the Romney and Obama campaigns sent us statements by Obama and news coverage about what he did -- and didn’t -- say in the days and weeks after that June 13, 2009, election. Let’s look at Obama’s statements day by day.

June 13, 2009

Press secretary Robert Gibbs released a brief statement: ""Like the rest of the world, we were impressed by the vigorous debate and enthusiasm that this election generated, particularly among young Iranians. We continue to monitor the entire situation closely, including reports of irregularities.""

June 15, 2009

During a press conference with visiting prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, Obama was asked a question about the violence in Iran. Obama said he was ""deeply troubled by the violence that I've been seeing on television. I think that the democratic process -- free speech, the ability of people to peacefully dissent -- all those are universal values and need to be respected. And whenever I see violence perpetrated on people who are peacefully dissenting, and whenever the American people see that, I think they're, rightfully, troubled. ...""

Obama said that he would continue to pursue dialogue with Iran. ""But even as we do so, I think it would be wrong for me to be silent about what we've seen on the television over the last few days. And what I would say to those people who put so much hope and energy and optimism into the political process, I would say to them that the world is watching and inspired by their participation, regardless of what the ultimate outcome of the election was. And they should know that the world is watching. And particularly to the youth of Iran, I want them to know that we in the United States do not want to make any decisions for the Iranians, but we do believe that the Iranian people and their voices should be heard and respected.""

Still, that response was widely considered subdued. The Washington Post wrote June 15 that the administration ""has remained as quiet as possible"" and that Obama’s response was ""subdued"" as he was seeking balance ""between condemning what increasingly appears to be a fraudulent election and the likelihood that it will be dealing with Ahmadinejad after the dust settles.""

Romney pounced on Obama on ABC’s This Week on June 14: ""What has occurred is that the election is a fraud, the results are inaccurate, and you're seeing a brutal repression of the people as they protest. The president ought to come out and state exactly those words, indicate that this has been a terribly managed decision by the autocratic regime in Iran.""

In a June 17, 2009, article the New York Times stated that officials in Washington were debating whether Obama’s response had been too muted. Some officials including Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for a stronger tone, while others in the White House said that could lead to the idea that the protests were led by Americans:

""So far, Mr. Obama has largely followed that script, criticizing violence against the protesters, but saying that he does not want to be seen as meddling in Iranian domestic politics,"" the New York Times reported.

June 16, 2009

During a press conference while meeting with President Lee Myung-Bak of the Republic of Korea, when asked about Iran, Obama said that he had ""deep concerns about the election. .... Now, it's not productive, given the history of U.S.-Iranian relations, to be seen as meddling -- the U.S. President meddling in Iranian elections. What I will repeat and what I said yesterday is that when I see violence directed at peaceful protestors, when I see peaceful dissent being suppressed, wherever that takes place, it is of concern to me and it's of concern to the American people. That is not how governments should interact with their people."" He called for allowing ""people's voices should be heard and not suppressed.""

The Washington Post reported that Obama went on CNBC on June 16 and said: ""When you've got 100,000 people who are out on the streets peacefully protesting, and they're having to be scattered through violence and gunshots, what that tells me is the Iranian people are not convinced of the legitimacy of the election. And my hope is that the regime responds not with violence, but with a recognition that the universal principles of peaceful expression and democracy are ones that should be affirmed.""

June 19, 2009

The New York Times wrote that in an interview with CBS news on June 19, ""Obama spoke cautiously about warnings by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, of bloodshed if the protests go on. ''I'm very concerned, based on some of the tenor and tone of the statements that have been made, that the government of Iran recognize that the world is watching.""

June 20, 2009

In a statement specifically about Iran, Obama said: ""...We mourn each and every innocent life that is lost. We call on the Iranian government to stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people. The universal rights to assembly and free speech must be respected, and the United States stands with all who seek to exercise those rights. As I said in Cairo, suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. The Iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their own government. If the Iranian government seeks the respect of the international community, it must respect the dignity of its own people and govern through consent, not coercion....""

June 23, 2009

In a statement about Iran, Obama spoke more strongly: ""The United States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, the beatings and imprisonments of the last few days. I strongly condemn these unjust actions, and I join with the American people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost..."" He said that while the United States is not interfering with Iran’s affairs, ""we deplore the violence against innocent civilians anywhere that it takes place. The Iranian people are trying to have a debate about their future. Some in Iran -- some in the Iranian government, in particular, are trying to avoid that debate by accusing the United States and others in the West of instigating protests over the elections. ...""

Later analysis

In September 2012, the New York Times wrote an article looking back at how Obama handled the Arab Spring: ""...as large street protests broke out in Iran after disputed presidential elections, Mr. Obama followed a low-key script, criticizing violence but saying he did not want to be seen as meddling in Iranian domestic politics. Months later, administration officials said, Mr. Obama expressed regret about his muted stance on Iran. ‘There was a feeling of ""we ain’t gonna be behind the curve on this again,"" ‘ one senior administration official said, who spoke to the New York Times on condition of anonymity.""

We asked the White House after the debate if it could confirm that anonymous statement and did not get an immediate reply.

Our ruling

Romney said that Obama was silent ""when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred.""

Romney was referring to the aftermath of the June 13, 2009, re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which led to massive protests.

Two days later on June 15, in response to a question at a press conference, Obama said he was ""deeply troubled"" by the violence, and that it would be wrong for him to remain silent. Obama made similar remarks the next day. On June 20, he issued a statement specifically calling on the Iranian government to stop the violence, and on June 23 he condemned the government for its response.

Obama was criticized for showing a muted response in the days following the start of the protests. But it is an exaggeration to say that Obama was ""silent.""

Mitt Romney says Pakistan is on a path to overtake the U.K. in nuclear weapons
","
Pakistan emerged as a source of concern during the third presidential debate in Boca Raton, Fla., which focused on foreign policy.

At one point, Mitt Romney said, ""Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they’re rushing to build a lot more. They’ll have more than Great Britain sometime in the relatively near future.""

We wondered whether Pakistan, a relative newcomer to the nuclear club, was really poised to leapfrog longtime nuclear power Great Britain.

First, let’s look at where the nations stand now. Here’s an estimate of the total warheads possessed by today’s nuclear powers, according to the Federation of American Scientists. In most cases, the number of operational warheads -- as opposed to stockpiled and decommissioned weapons -- is smaller:

Russia: 10,000
United States 8,000
France: 300
China: 240
United Kingdom: 225
Israel: 80
Pakistan: 90-110
India: 80-100
North Korea: Less than 10

So today, Pakistan’s warhead total is well behind that of the U.K. But Romney said ""sometime in the relatively near future.""

That’s a vague timeframe, but the experts we contacted said it’s a plausible supposition. It involves two trend lines: the United Kingdom’s arsenal is set to drop, and Pakistan’s arsenal is set to increase.

In 2010, the British government committed to cap its total arsenal at 180. So to equal the U.K., Pakistan would need to see its arsenal rise from about 100 to 180. Can it do it?

Experts say it’s possible. Hans Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists projected earlier this year that Pakistan’s warhead total ""might increase to 150-200 within the next decade.""

Matthew Bunn, a public policy professor at Harvard University who specializes in nuclear weapons, said that ""Pakistan has the world's fastest-growing nuclear arsenal, as well as the arsenal most threatened by terrorists -- a worrisome combination."" Pakistan is not only continuing to produce highly enriched uranium, Bunn said, but is also ramping up production of plutonium ""at an alarming rate.""

Once its four current and planned plutonium production facilities are all operational, he said, they might be able to produce 10 to 15 bombs a year. ""At that rate, it is quite plausible that in the not-too-distant future they might pass the U.K.""

We should reiterate that these are projections, made without a lot of transparency and lots of uncertainty. And Pakistan may have an incentive to exaggerate its nuclear capacity for strategic reasons.

Still, John Pike, a national security specialist with globalsecurity.org, agreed that the Romney scenario is a plausible one. ""If by ‘relatively near future’ we mean ‘within a decade,’ I think that is pretty close to the mark,"" he said.

Our ruling

Romney said, ""Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they’re rushing to build a lot more. They’ll have more than Great Britain sometime in the relatively near future."" While there is an enormous amount of uncertainty about how fast Pakistan will expand its nuclear arsenal, experts tell us that there’s a plausible path for Pakistan’s total to match the U.K.’s in roughly a decade. So we rate Romney’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097186100>],/factchecks/2012/oct/23/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-pakistan-path-overtake-uk-nuclear/

Barack Obama: Mitt Romney said troops should still be in Iraq
","
President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney sparred during the third presidential debate over how Obama ended the Iraq war, a decision he announced about a year ahead of their final matchup.

The candidates at one point saw eye-to-eye on an exit strategy, Romney said, though they now disagree over Obama’s call to withdraw all troops by the end of 2011.

""With regards to Iraq, you and I agreed, I believe, that there should be a status of forces agreement,"" Romney said during the Lynn University debate in Boca Raton, Fla.

Obama cut in, saying, ""That’s not true,"" prompting more cross-talk about the number of troops each wanted to remain and the lack of a status of forces agreement with the Iraqi government.

Obama criticized Romney for saying in a speech ""just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq.""

""No, I didn’t, I’m sorry -- I indicated that you failed to put in place a status of forces agreement at the end of the conflict --"" Romney said before Obama jumped in again.

""Governor, here’s one thing … I’ve learned as commander in chief. You’ve got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean,"" Obama said. ""Now, you just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq. That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East.""

We were interested in Obama’s claim that Romney recently said troops should still be in place in Iraq.

First, we’ll note Romney’s point about how both candidates wanted some troops to remain as part of an agreement with the Iraqi government is fair. Before President George W. Bush left office in 2008, the Iraqi Parliament ratified a pact, or a status of forces agreement, with the U.S. that put the complete withdrawal of troops by the end of 2011.

Still, officials on both sides expected some American troops to remain to help protect and train the Iraqis with security threats to their border, waterways and airspace, the New York Times reported. Over the course of 2011, Obama scaled down the number of troops he thought should be in place to between 3,000 and 5,000.

In the end, the breaking point was not over the size of a remaining force, but over Iraqi officials not wanting to grant American soldiers immunity under Iraqi law.

The result: No combat troops remained in Iraq. About 200 people in the military are there now, and they report to the U.S. ambassador, a U.S. Defense Department spokesman said. This does not include security contractors, for which the spokesman had no estimate. 
Some U.S. military officers saw Obama’s Oct. 21, 2011, announcement of a complete withdrawal as him ""putting best face on a breakdown in tortured negotiations with the Iraqis,"" the New York Times reported. 
This brings us back to our check: Did Romney say the U.S. should have troops in Iraq to this day?

He has not used those words, but it’s a reasonable inference of his public positions on the withdrawal of troops from Iraq.

The Obama campaign directed us to Romney’s remarks on foreign policy at the Virginia Military Institute on Oct. 8, 2012. In that speech, like many times before, Romney criticized Obama for pursuing a total withdrawal from the country instead of securing a residual force.

""In Iraq the costly gains made by our troops are being eroded by rising violence, a resurgent al-Qaida, the weakening of democracy in Baghdad and the rising influence of Iran,"" he said. ""And yet America’s ability to influence events for the better in Iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence. The president’s tried, he tried, but he also failed to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains.""

Romney did not specify in his foreign policy speech what he thought a reasonable residual force would be. But in a December 2011 interview with Fox News, he said ""we should have left 10-, 20-, 30,000 personnel there to help transition to the Iraqi's own military capabilities.""

We could not find an instance in which Romney said how long troops should have been in place. The main takeaway from the debate exchange, a Romney spokesman said, is Obama did not fulfill his own plan to leave a residual force in Iraq after 2012.

The Obama campaign says it is reasonable to say thousands of troops would still be in place had Romney has his way.

""So those comments -- and with no clear plan forward on Iraq – mean troops would be there right now,"" wrote Kara Carscaden, Obama campaign spokeswoman, in an email.

Our ruling

According to Obama, Romney said in a recent speech ""we should still have troops in Iraq.""

In a speech at the Virginia Military Institute, Romney said the United States has been ""undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence"" and that Obama ""failed to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown.""

So Romney wanted a sizeable presence of U.S. troops in Iraq past 2011 as part of a status of forces agreement, which the Obama administration sought but did not get with the Iraqi government. The agreement would have been part of an overall drawdown.

Herando County candidate claims rival for supervisor of elections gave bad information
","
Hernando supervisor of elections candidate Elizabeth Townsend stood on stage at a recent political forum and defended herself against the way she was portrayed in recent flier distributed by her opponent, Shirley Anderson. 
""Elizabeth Townsend Runs The Office That . . ."" the mailer reads in large yellow letters. Below the statement are excerpts from newspaper articles highlighting recent problems with the elections office. One headline reads, ""Ballot omits school race."" Another states ""Faulty advice, political disaster / An election official steers School Board hopeful William Kingeter wrong."" 
In this fact-check, we will examine the claim that Townsend runs the office. We'll also explore what role she had in the recent issues excerpted on the mailer. 
• • • 
Townsend has been the director of operations for the elections office since December 2010. 
The official job description for the position includes a list of more than 30 responsibilities. These include everything from informing and training staff on office procedures to ensuring that redistricting is carried out after each national census to knowing and understanding Florida election laws. 
Nowhere does it say the director of operations runs the office. 
The job description clearly denotes that the person in the position serves the supervisor of elections. 
The operations director, according to the description, is responsible for ""performing assigned responsibilities effectively and efficiently within the framework set forth by the Supervisor of Elections."" It also states the director will perform ""other duties as assigned"" and will handle ""speaking engagements unless the Supervisor of Elections states otherwise."" 
Hernando Supervisor of Elections Annie Williams took issue with the claim Anderson makes in the flier. 
""Liz does not run the office,"" she said. ""I am ultimately responsible for everything that goes on in here."" 
She added: ""As far as running the office, Annie Williams is in charge of running the Supervisor of Elections Office."" 
Between the job description and the statements from Williams, the answer of who runs the office seems clear-cut. 
But it gets a bit more complicated. 
In at least two places, Townsend has claimed to run or operate the Supervisor of Elections Office. When asked why she said Townsend runs the office, Anderson pointed to these statements. 
""I have run this office in a nonpartisan manner and have proven I will continue to do so by treating all voters and candidates with dignity and respect regardless of party affiliation,"" Townsend claims as part of her candidate statement on the Hernando elections office's website. 
On her campaign website, elizabethtownsend.org, she writes: ""Currently as the Director of Operations, I: Operate the elections office in an efficient, fiscally responsible, nonpartisan manner."" 
Williams disagreed with these characterizations. 
""That's somewhat overstated, yes,"" she said. 
Townsend said Williams runs the office. 
""My responsibilities obviously encompass things that are part of that office. It would be impossible to separate the two,"" she said in an email. ""I operate and carry out my responsibilities within the framework that the supervisor of election sets. She runs the office."" 
Said Anderson: ""If (Townsend) is now trying to convince people that she does not oversee the daily operations of this office, then she has clearly embellished her resume."" 
• • • 
So what about Townsend's role in the two incidents highlighted in the mailer? 
The July 26 headline, ""Faulty advice, political disaster,"" refers to an incident where Williams mistakenly gave School Board candidate William Kingeter the incorrect election date after misreading Florida Statutes. Williams told him he would appear on the Nov. 6 general election ballot when School Board races were actually on the Aug. 14 primary ballot. 
Kingeter said the error cost him valuable campaign time. 
Williams admitted to making the mistake. In addition, Kingeter verified that Townsend did not give him the misinformation. 
Townsend's only involvement came later when she found out about the mistake. She called the candidate and provided him the correct information. 
The story ""Ballot omits school race"" highlights an incident that came shortly before the primary election. In it, one School Board race was omitted from one voting machine. A vendor failed to load the latest information, according to a news release provided by Advanced Ballot Solutions, the vendor. 
""It was identified that the ballot file installed on one of your systems by ABS was not updated with the official ballot for Style 31N1, as provided to us by the Hernando County Supervisor of Elections,"" it reads. 
The person who got the first incorrect ballot, School Board member Dianne Bonfield, noticed the problem and alerted the office. The problem was fixed, and no other voters were affected. Bonfield was eventually able to cast a correct ballot. 
The Tampa Bay Times asked Anderson if she had information connecting Townsend to these incidents. 
""Nowhere on the mailer did it say that she contributed directly to these gaffes,"" she wrote in an email. ""You did."" 
Our ruling 
Anderson's flier claims Townsend runs the elections office. That overstates her opponent's role. 
Both Townsend's job description and her boss make it very clear: The supervisor of elections runs the Supervisor of Elections Office. 
But Townsend also stretched the truth by claiming to run or operate the office. 
They are both misleading statements. 
As for connecting Townsend to the incidents cited in the mailer, Anderson misleads voters. Townsend had no role in them. 
For stretching the truth and misleading voters, PolitiFact rates this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097305180>],/factchecks/2012/oct/23/shirley-anderson/herando-county-candidate-claims-rival-supervisor-e/

Mitt Romney says Latin America’s economy is ""almost as big"" as the economy of China
","
During the third presidential debate in Boca Raton, Fla., Mitt Romney touted Latin America as a region that’s ripe for expanding trade with the United States.

""Trade grows about 12 percent year,"" Romney said. ""It doubles about five or so years. We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America. The opportunities for us in Latin America, we have just not taken advantage (of them) of fully. As a matter of fact, Latin America’s economy is almost as big as the economy of China. We’re all focused on China. Latin America is a huge opportunity for us — time zone, language opportunities.""

We won’t judge whether Latin America is a ""huge opportunity"" for the U.S., but we were curious whether it’s true that ""Latin America’s economy is almost as big as the economy of China.""

We turned to data on gross domestic product collected by the International Monetary Fund. For Latin America, we combined the GDP for 20 nations: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. For China, we added up the GDP for China and, using World Bank data, its two  ""special administrative regions,"" Hong Kong and Macau.

In 2011, the 20 Latin American nations had a combined nominal GDP of $5.6 trillion, while China, Hong Kong and Macau had a combined GDP of $7.6 trillion. So, China’s GDP was about one-third larger than Latin America’s, meaning the two are hardly neck and neck. 
Eric Farnsworth, vice president of the Council of the Americas and an aide in the White House Office of the Special Envoy for the Americas under President Bill Clinton, said you can’t close the gap between Latin America and China without broadening the definition to ""the Americas"" by adding Canada, something we don’t think was suggested by Romney’s claim. But even then, the combination of Latin America and Canada still wouldn't get you to the GDP level of China.

In addition, the growth in China's economy has been outpacing Latin America's, putting Latin America even further behind as time goes on. Between 2010 and 2011, Latin America’s GDP expanded by 14 percent -- an impressive growth rate -- but China’s grew by an even more impressive 23 percent. ""China growth has been extraordinary; Latin America’s has not,"" said Barry Bosworth, an international economics scholar at the Brookings Institution. 
This growth pattern further weakens Romney’s argument that Latin America’s economy is ""almost as big.""

Our ruling

Romney said that ""Latin America’s economy is almost as big as the economy of China."" It's a stretch to characterize an economy that's about one-third bigger as ""almost as big,"" especially since China’s lead over Latin America is actually increasing.

Obama says Romney opposed any government help to rescue carmakers
","
The recovery of the American auto industry offers proof of the old saw that success has a thousand fathers while failure is an orphan.

Mitt Romney has said that President Barack Obama followed the plan Romney laid out in 2008. For his part, Obama has said Romney would have let General Motors and Chrysler fend for themselves as they went through bankruptcy.

In their final debate before the election, Obama repeated his charge against Romney.

""You keep on trying to, you know, airbrush history here,"" Obama said.""You were very clear that you would not provide government assistance to the U.S. auto companies, even if they went through bankruptcy. You said that they could get it in the private marketplace.""

In a spirited back and forth, Romney insisted the president was wrong.

""I said that we would provide guarantees,"" Romney said. ""That was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy. Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet.""

In this fact-check, we’ll examine Obama’s charge that Romney would not provide government assistance to the car companies, even if they went through bankruptcy.

Early in 2008, Romney said in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club that, ""I am not open to a bailout, but I am open to a workout. Washington should not be a benefactor, but it can and must be a partner.""

Later that year, Romney wrote a now well-known New York Times op-ed called ""Let Detroit go bankrupt.""

Both men encouraged voters to look at that. We did, and here is what Romney wrote:

""The federal government should provide guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing and assure car buyers that their warranties are not at risk.""

Romney’s campaign said this referred to the government providing a guarantee to private lenders who stepped in to keep the carmakers running while they went through bankruptcy. Such a guarantee would have drawn in private lenders even at a moment when conventional credit markets were frozen.

In bankruptcies, it is not uncommon to allow companies to continue to operate because this gives the creditors the best shot at getting more of their money back. By definition, a bankrupt business is short on money, and in order to make payroll and pay suppliers, there is something called debtor-in-possession or DIP financing.

But Romney did not speak of DIP financing directly. We asked Laura Beth Bartell, a bankruptcy law professor at Wayne State Law School, if the term he did use, ""post-bankruptcy financing,"" would mean the same thing.

""I can’t read Romney’s mind as to what he meant when he used the phrase,"" Bartell said. ""But most bankruptcy lawyers would interpret ‘post-bankruptcy financing’ to refer to DIP financing.""

However, Romney’s term ""post-bankruptcy financing"" has been used in a different sense as well. Sometimes it means the financing a company receives once the bankruptcy is completed. (For example, a 2007 article in CFO with the headline ""Delta receives post-bankruptcy financing"" described a multibillion dollar package for the troubled airline that took effect after the company was out of bankruptcy.)

Steve Rattner, the former auto bailout chief in the Obama administration and a vocal critic of Romney, said Romney was using the term in this second sense - the longer-term loans that sustain a business after it exits bankruptcy.

""He was referring to the practice on Wall Street of providing ‘exit financing’ to companies coming out of bankruptcy,"" Rattner said. ""But because there was not DIP financing available, the companies would have never come out.""

Bartell disagreed. She said the term can have both meanings but noted that Romney was writing about a managed bankruptcy.

""I cannot imagine why he would be discussing the ability of the car companies to get financing after they emerged from bankruptcy when all the talk at the time was about their ability to get financing to allow them to operate during a bankruptcy.""

Total certainty of Romney’s intent may be elusive. John Pottow, a bankruptcy law professor at the University of Michigan Law School, said the term was used loosely in the op-ed.

""I'm not sure what it meant because the logical thing is for it to mean DIP financing,"" Pottow said. ""But the contextual thing means exit financing, because he's implying we shouldn't do anything during bankruptcy, only after bankruptcy.""

We asked the Romney campaign for any comments the governor made in 2008 that would clarify his meaning. The staff said they did not know of any.

Romney’s op-ed deals almost entirely with how GM and Chrysler ought to function after restructuring.  He said almost nothing about the process of bringing the companies to that point -- some nine words out of more than 800. This adds to the uncertainty surrounding his intent.

Our ruling

Obama said Romney would not provide government assistance to the car companies, even if they went through bankruptcy.

Romney’s term ""post-bankruptcy financing"" can have two meanings. It can refer to money used during bankruptcy and money used right afterwards. The distinction has great practical significance in this case, because without the loans in the middle of a bankruptcy, there might be no automakers to lend to on the other side.

We can't know for sure which meaning Romney had in mind. However, Obama made a strong assertion. He said Romney would offer no government aid even if the carmakers went through bankruptcy.

Romney’s words were vague and quite limited in number but he did speak of a government guarantee, and that would be the case whether he meant for loans during or after bankruptcy.

We rate Obama's statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A472A80>],/factchecks/2012/oct/23/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-opposed-any-government-help-resc/

Ashley Hinson took credit for Iowa locks and dams projects after opposing the projects in Congress
","On Jan. 19, U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, sent a press release that said $829 million in funding was allocated from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to repair and refurbish locks and dams on the upper Mississippi River. The press release served as an announcement by Hinson, Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., and Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa; Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., and Roy Blunt, R-Mo. Following the announcement, Hinson tweeted: ""We secured $829 million in federal funding to upgrade locks & dams along the Upper Mississippi River. This is game-changing for Iowa’s agriculture industry & our Mississippi River communities!""  The tweet garnered plenty of criticism from Democrats for her use of the word ""we"" in the statement, as she voted against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in July 2021 that is funding the program.  Iowa state Sen. Liz Mathis, D-Hiawatha, responded to Hinson’s tweet, accusing Hinson of taking credit for work she didn’t do. ""Ashley Hinson voted against the bipartisan infrastructure bill that made this money possible. Once again she’s taking credit for work she didn’t do,"" she said. Mathis is seeking the Democratic Party’s nomination to challenge Hinson in the 2022 election for Iowa’s reconfigured 2nd Congressional District.  ""This is yet another example of Ashley Hinson claiming that she supports investments that benefit Iowans, but voting along party lines against their best interests in Washington,"" Mathis wrote in an email to The Daily Iowan. The bill passed in the U.S. House on July 1 by a 221 to 201 vote, and then the U.S. Senate on Aug. 10 by a 69 to 30 vote. The only Iowans to vote in favor of the bill were Democrat Rep. Cindy Axne and Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley.  In a Jan. 20 press call to Iowa reporters, Hinson said she opposed the act because it was tied to social spending. However, she said, the money was going to be spent regardless once the bill was signed into law and Iowa should get its share. ""If there’s federal money on the table, do you think I’m going to sit back and let that go to states like California and New York? Hell no. I’m going to make sure as much of it comes back to Iowa,"" Hinson said.  The $829 million allocated to fix parts of the Mississippi River came after Hinson, Bustos, Grassley, Durbin and Blunt requested in a Dec. 10 letter to the Corps of Engineers that projects in the upper Mississippi River area get priority for infrastructure bill money. Sen. Joni Ernst, and Reps. Cindy Axne and Mariannette Miller-Meeks signed the letter as well. They did not spearhead the lobbying like the five lawmakers who worked together. Ernst and Miller-Meeks both opposed the infrastructure bill when it came to a vote.  The only Iowa lawmaker who did not sign the letter was Rep. Randy Feenstra.  In the January press release, which had statements from each member of the bipartisan Midwest congressional group, Hinson said the funds are necessary for fixing the river’s locks and dams to support supply chain movement in and out of Iowa’s 1st Congressional District. On Nov. 8, 2021, the day the infrastructure bill was presented to President Joe Biden for his signature, Hinson sent a press release condemning the bill, both because it was tied then to the Build Back Better Act, and because she said it contained unnecessary spending. The infrastructure bill reauthorized the $650 billion of existing spending that is usually allocated yearly for infrastructure needs, but added $550 billion in new spending. Hinson said in the press release that she would have voted for the bill if it only featured a reauthorization of the $650 billion to go to any infrastructure needs but opposed the addition of new funds. ""Let me level with you, I think most Iowans would support reasonable spending on real, physical infrastructure.  However, I believe this bill adds too much additional spending for items aside from the physical infrastructure Iowans care most about, without fully paying for them,"" the press release said.  Grassley, who, like Hinson, opposed in September a partisan Democrat-led supplemental spending bill that allocated money for Mississippi River projects, supported the infrastructure bill. He signed the letter lobbying for the river funds, tweeting on Jan. 19 and Jan. 20 that the allocated funds, which also include money for the Missouri River valley, will be beneficial for Iowa’s agriculture. He also sent out a press release that highlighted how he supported the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.  While Grassley’s release did not mention Hinson by name, he said the funds were allocated after a bicameral, bipartisan group of lawmakers sent the letter.  ""When I voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill, I was voting for exactly this type of federal support for critical infrastructure that Iowans depend on,"" Grassley’s press release said.  Liz Mathis has accused Ashley Hinson of taking undeserved credit for getting federal funding for Mississippi River locks and dams. The claim is based on the fact that Hinson voted against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that is funding the works project.  Mathis ignores in her statement that Hinson lobbied the Army Corps of Engineers to spend funds from the bill on lock and dam repairs. Hinson says she wanted to make sure Iowa got its share of money made available by the bill.    But, additional money Hinson voted against had to be available for the $829 billion worth of work to be done. Had her ""no"" vote prevailed, the additional money may not have been available in future bills.  We rate Mathis’ claim to be Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BC8280>],/factchecks/2022/jan/21/liz-mathis/hinson-joined-letter-iowa-lock-and-dam-money-she-d/

The headline, which lacks detail about who and where is affected by the recommendation, is misleading. The article links to another website that accurately references a Moderna policy change that applies only to those under age 31 in one European country, Belgium. The Newsbreak article is just a brief paragraph that says, in part, ""There are all kinds of discussions about the potential side effects of the covid vaccine, and these include heart inflammation for younger people. Check out the latest reports involving Moderna vaccines below.""  It then links to a site called Health Thoroughfare, which more accurately reports the details of Belgium’s recommendation for Moderna use, saying ""the very rare side effect among under-31s of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine"" led Belgium to stop recommending it for that age group. Belgium announced it would stop using the Moderna vaccine as a first or second dose for 18- to 30-year-olds, because of a rare side effect of inflammation of the heart muscle, The Brussels Times reported. People in that age group can still receive Moderna as a booster shot, according to the newspaper. ""The decision for the basic vaccination of 18- to 30-year-olds is based on international knowledge of possible side effects that are very rare. We took this decision as a precaution,"" Gudrun Briat, the spokesperson for the Vaccination Task Force, told the newspaper.  ""Usually the inflammation is harmless and goes away without being noticed, but if there is an alternative vaccine available, it makes more sense not to take any risks,"" Briat said, according to the article. Other European nations have taken similar steps, PolitiFact reported. In the fall, Sweden temporarily suspended the use of Moderna for those under 30 years old; Finland stopped using Moderna for males under 30 years old; Norway recommended that people under age 18 and men under age 30 take the Pfizer vaccine instead of Moderna’s but did not require it; and Denmark said those under 18 can request Moderna if they wish. The headline on a blog article reads, ""Moderna COVID vaccine is no longer recommended due to heart inflammation."" The headline is misleading; it gives the false impression that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine has been widely discredited. A new recommendation about the Moderna vaccine applies only to those under the age of 31 in one European country, Belgium, and only to the two initial doses, not boosters.

NC legislator inaccurately describes redistricting case
","A Democratic state legislator in North Carolina used social media to try to summarize a recent legal challenge to the state’s election maps. State Sen. Deb Butler of New Hanover County serves as the Democratic House whip. She has 20,000 followers on Twitter. On Jan. 12, she tweeted:  ""So the NC appeals court said… and I paraphrase, yeah, it is despicable, the maps are skewed, citizens will be deprived of their vote, we agree with the experts, democracy hangs in the balance, yada yada, but you know, we are partisan hacks so we gonna live with it."" Is that an accurate description of what happened in court? Not exactly. Let’s go through the tweet. In North Carolina, the legislature draws the state’s election maps. Voting rights groups recently sued state lawmakers, saying the GOP majority drew the state’s new maps to give Republicans an advantage in an inordinate number of Congressional and legislative districts.  The case was heard by a panel of judges in Wake County Superior Court, not the state Court of Appeals. The plaintiffs’ requests for relief were denied in a unanimous decision. The case is being appealed and is scheduled to be heard by the state Supreme Court on Feb. 2. Butler did not say why she called it an appeals court. ""I believe, and I do not think there can be any argument, that free and fair elections are fundamental to the continued existence of our democracy,"" Butler wrote in an email to PolitiFact NC. ""Given the findings that were made by the appellate court, I cannot fathom their decision."" Butler said the judges are ""partisan hacks."" The opinion of whether they are ""hacks"" isn’t suited for the Truth-O-Meter, but we can clarify some things about judges’ political affiliations and the manner of the court. Judges in North Carolina are elected. Each judicial candidate’s political party affiliation is listed on the ballot when they run for office. The races were nonpartisan from 2004 until about five years ago. GOP legislators restored partisan affiliations on the ballot for state Court of Appeals and Supreme Court candidates in 2016, and then for lower courts beginning in 2018. In her email to PolitiFact NC, Butler said her use of the word ""partisan"" referred to that change in the law and how judges now carry political party labels. ""Regrettably, the NC Republican majority passed legislation restoring partisan labels on members of the judiciary and to me, this decision reflects their re-election fears rather than a fair, just and impartial review."" Some Twitter users took Butler’s tweet to mean she believes the judges were all from the same party or ideology. That’s not the case. In the redistricting case, the three-judge panel included two Republicans and one Democrat. Judges Graham Shirley and Nathaniel Poovey are Republicans. Judge Dawn Layton was appointed by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper in 2019. Layton is a registered Democrat who ran for her judicial seat as a Democrat in the 2020 election.  Layton, Shirley and Poovey ruled unanimously on the case. In a Richmond Observer story about Layton’s appointment, colleagues and adversaries described her as someone who is fair. Shirley, for his part, hasn’t always ruled with Republicans. In 2017, he allowed the Watauga County Board of Elections to set up an early voting site on Appalachian State University’s campus — at the objection of the board’s Republican chairman and the local GOP’s vice chairman. The Watauga Democrat newspaper wrote about the case. Butler’s paraphrasing of the judges’ views on the GOP-drawn maps isn’t far off-base. The judges did state as fact in their ruling that ""the Congressional map is the product of intentional, pro-Republican partisan redistricting"" while calling the state House and Senate plans ""extreme outliers."" They echoed the comments of Duke University statistician Jonathan Mattingly, writing on page 54 of the opinion that the legislative districts ""systematically favor the Republican Party to an extent which is rarely, if ever, seen in the non-partisan collection of maps.""  While the judges didn’t call the maps despicable, they did on page 246 express ""disdain for having to deal with issues that potentially lead to results incompatible with democratic principles and subject our State to ridicule."" The judges did allow the maps to remain law. Butler’s tweet gave people the impression she was referring to the judges having a common political ideology, which is not reflected in their party affiliations. Her email suggests they ruled the way they did because they’re worried about re-election. In their opinion, the judges offered a legal reasoning for their ruling. The state constitution gives the legislators the power to draw election maps. Judges wrote that the maps are ""the result of a democratic process"" and that the free elections clause of the state constitution ""does not operate as a restraint on the General Assembly’s ability to redistrict for partisan advantage."" Butler said the ""NC appeals court"" confirmed the state’s election maps ""are skewed"" but didn’t block them because they are ""partisan hacks."" Butler, who acknowledged she was paraphrasing, generally captured the judges’ views on the election maps. Judges expressed ""disdain"" for having to deal with election maps that they acknowledged are ""extreme outliers"" that benefit Republicans. However, she got a basic fact wrong. The case was heard in superior court — not the state Court of Appeals. And there’s no apparent evidence that the judges ruled the way they did because of their partisan affiliation. She failed to capture the judges’ reasoning for their vote. And she gave some people the impression that the judges are affiliated with the same party, which isn’t the case. The tweet contains an element of truth: Superior court judges acknowledged the maps are skewed. However, it ignores critical facts about the judges and ruling that would give readers a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C453580>],/factchecks/2022/jan/21/deb-butler/nc-legislator-inaccurately-describes-redistricting/
"['Education', 'Virginia', 'Glenn Youngkin']","
Youngkin's claim about Virginia's low K-12 standards need context
","In his maiden speech to the General Assembly, Gov. Glenn Youngkin reaffirmed his campaign vow to stiffen academic standards in public schools. ""Virginia schools have a lofty reputation but lately we’ve not lived up to that reputation,"" Youngkin, a Republican, said in a Jan. 17 address. ""In fact, our educational standards for math and reading are now the lowest in the nation."" We fact-checked Youngkin’s last-in-the nation claim during the campaign and think it bears repeating now that he’s in office. Federal research does show Virginia has the lowest baselines for student proficiency on its standardized tests of all measured states for fourth-grade math and reading and eighth-grade reading. This comparison only measures the rigor of various state standards, however, not how well students are learning. When it comes to performance on standardized national exams, Virginia’s fourth graders rank near the top and its eighth graders rank high in math and at the national average in reading. Youngkin does not offer this important perspective.    Youngkin’s bottom-of-the-barrel claim is based on a 2021 report by the National Center for Education Statistics, a branch of the U.S. Department of Education. The center examined the proficiency standards in each state in 2019 and assigned them ""equivalent scores"" on a 0-to-500 scale. Higher scores mean higher standards. ""The study is intended to help readers understand the myriad state assessment results that are otherwise difficult to compare and to serve a policy need for reliable information that compares state standards,"" the report says. ""The study is not an evaluation of the various state assessments or of the quality of the states’ achievement standards, and the findings should not be interpreted as evidence of deficiencies in state assessments…"" In other words, the study is not judging whether state proficiency standards on tests  should be high, low or in the middle. It’s just offering data. The report focuses on reading and math tests in fourth and eighth grades. The equivalent score compares the percentage of students who are deemed proficient on state tests to the percentage that reach the proficiency standard on national tests. Virginia’s exams are called Standards of Learning tests, or SOLs, and are taken by all fourth and eighth graders, as well as some other grades. The national exam is taken by a representative sample of fourth and eight graders in each state. It’s called National Assessment of Education Progress but is better known as the ""Nation’s Report Card."" In fourth grade reading, Virginia’s proficiency standards were the lowest among 49 states (excluding New Hampshire). The equivalent score was 200. The median score among states was 224. Tennessee had the highest score at 238. In fourth grade math, Virginia standards were again the lowest among 49 states. The equivalent score was 219. The median was 242. Colorado had the highest score at 257. In eighth grade reading, Virginia’s proficiency standards were lowest among 46 states measured. The equivalent score was 236. The median was 266. Kansas was highest, at 288. Virginia’s standards for eighth grade math were not measured, nor were those of 14 other states. The reason — according to Charles Pyle, director of media relations for the Virginia Department of Education — is that eighth graders take different math classes based on their abilities, so there is not a single standardized math exam for everyone. Experts stress that equivalent scores do not evaluate how well students are learning. ""What Virginia considers proficient may not be at the same level of what other states consider proficient,"" Grady Wilburn, a statistician for the National Center for Education Statistics, told us last fall. ""It doesn’t mean that the students know less than students in other states."" Indeed, Virginia fourth graders in 2019 had the third-highest math score on the national test and the ninth-highest reading score. Virginia eighth graders ranked seventh in math and 30th in reading. Youngkin says Virginia’s public schools have strayed from basic instruction under the last two Democratic governors, Ralph Northam and Terry McAuliffe, who led the state from 2014 to 2022. Youngkin says the state’s standardized tests should require students to attain high, aspirational learning levels. Virginia’s proficiency standards for reading were set in 2013 by a state school board appointed by Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell. The math standards were set in 2019 by a state school board appointed by McAuliffe and Northam.  McAuliffe deemphasized standardized testing when he was governor from 2014 to 2018, a move that was cheered by many local school boards and gained bipartisan support in the General Assembly. Dan Gecker, president of the state school board, said Virginia’s proficiency standards are set with a practical goal rather than an aspirational one. ""We’re looking to set the cut level at a specific body of knowledge for a child to succeed at the next grade level,"" he said. Youngkin said Virginia’s ""education standards for math and reading are now the lowest in the nation."" He is referring to a federal study that shows Virginia in 2019 had the lowest baselines for proficiency on its standardized tests for fourth grade math and reading and eighth grade reading. The National Center for Education Statistics does not compare test standards for other grades. Youngkin’s statement, however, skips important context. The NCES stresses that its equivalency ratings on standardized tests in states do not reflect how well students are learning in each state. Youngkin omits that Virginia students score near the top on standardized national tests for fourth grade math and reading and eight grade math. Eighth grade leading levels are at the national average. Youngkin’s claim, without elaboration, wrongly suggests that Virginia students are being taught less than their colleagues across the county. So we rate his statement Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4482C0>],/factchecks/2022/jan/21/glenn-youngkin/youngkins-claim-about-virginias-low-k-12-standards/

Mitt Romney jab over 7% inflation ignores rising wages
","With the highest inflation rates in decades weighing heavily on the minds of many Americans, both Republicans and Democrats have been waging a messaging war about how good, or bad, the economy really is. On the Jan. 16 edition of NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, took a shot at President Joe Biden’s stewardship of the economy and other matters of state.  ""He's had a bad year,"" Romney, the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee, said of Biden. ""He's had 52 weeks of bad weeks. I mean, people are 7% poorer now because of Biden inflation. Gasoline prices are, what, 50% higher than they were when he took office. The border is a mess. COVID was resurgent, but he didn't have in place the tests people needed to keep themselves safe. And then, of course, there was the disaster in Afghanistan. Russia's now threatening Ukraine. Things are not going well."" Here, we’ll look at Romney’s assertion that ""people are 7% poorer now because of Biden inflation."" The inflation rate was 7% during 2021. However, Romney’s focus on inflation alone to claim that Americans are ""7% poorer"" leaves out half of the equation: rising incomes. An unusually rapid rise in wages erased a lot of, although not all of, the inflation bump last year. ""The thought is incomplete,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. ""It leaves out important context."" Romney’s office said that his comment was based on the recently released inflation numbers, and argued that wage growth varies across different industries, regions and income segments. Last year’s 7% rise in the Consumer Price Index, the government’s main inflation indicator, was the biggest increase since 1982, when President Ronald Reagan was still in his first term in office. Inflation on that scale can be a major economic problem, because it tends to make the typical individual or family poorer, all other things being equal. (There is some variation in who gets hit hardest by rising inflation.) However, all other things are not equal. Incomes go up, too. If someone’s salary or wages go up faster than the inflation rate, they’ll still come out ahead. If their pay keeps pace with inflation, they’ll be no worse off. If it doesn’t, then they will be poorer.  The median American worker was indeed poorer in December 2021 than in December 2020. But Romney’s claim that they were ""7% poorer"" exaggerated the amount. Rising wages covered about two-thirds of the rise in prices. The best measure to evaluate this comparison, according to economists, is average hourly earnings for all private employees. This measurement is well suited for checking Romney’s assertion, because it’s reported monthly, like the inflation data. Between December 2020 and December 2021, average hourly earnings for private employees rose by 4.7%, which is a healthy increase by historical standards.  That still meant the typical American fell behind by 2.3%, a notable and worrisome figure. But that’s a fraction of the 7% that Romney cited. Inflation-adjusted wages ""have declined slightly, but by significantly less than 7%,"" said Molly Kinder, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. Other measures paint a similar picture. A private sector measure, the Payscale Index, provides data through the third quarter of 2021. It found that year-over-year wage growth, once adjusted for inflation, was negative 0.5%.  And an analysis by the Brookings Institution of data reported by 13 large companies (including Amazon and McDonalds) through October 2021 found that workers at 10 of the companies saw wage gains even after accounting for inflation. Finally, some economists took issue with Romney’s term ""Biden inflation."" Presidents can have an impact on the economy through the policies they pursue, but a number of factors beyond the control of any president, including the status of the coronavirus pandemic globally and supply-chain difficulties, have played a significant role in accelerating inflation. By focusing only on the inflation rate and not rising wages, Romney ""is attributing 100% of the blame for the negative impact of price change to the president, while assigning 0% of the credit for the income gains to Biden,"" said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist.

Is omicron variant the fastest spreading virus? It depends on the metric used for measuring
","As the omicron variant of COVID-19 rapidly made its way around the world — infiltrating 89 countries within three weeks of first being identified in late November — it became the fastest-spreading variant since the start of the pandemic. Social media users attempted to quantify its place among viruses throughout history. ""Omicron is now the fastest-spreading virus known to humankind,"" began one three-minute Facebook video. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is more than one way to quantify virus’ spread: One is to measure how easily a virus is transmitted from person to person, and another is to look at how quickly it spreads across the world. When it comes to the former, measles is the fastest. For the latter, it’s omicron. Measles is the most contagious virus when it comes to transmission between people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each person who contracts it can infect 12 to 18 other people, in a population not protected by vaccines and other preventative measures. The omicron variant ranks as a close second, though: Each person who contracts omicron can infect between 7 and 14 people in an unvaccinated, unprotected population, studies show. One term scientists use to quantify infectious disease outbreaks is R0, pronounced ""R naught,"" and called the basic reproduction number. It indicates the average number of times one person will transmit the virus to someone else in a population where no one has been exposed to or vaccinated against the disease, and is therefore a more theoretical measure. The basic reproduction number for measles is between 12 and 18. For COVID-19, the basic reproduction number has increased with each strain of the virus. With the original strain, each sick person likely would infect between two and three others; with the delta variant, between five and seven; and with omicron, most estimates put it at 1.5 to 2 times more than delta. That means with omicron, each sick person infects between 7 and 14 people. Another mathematical measure for the spread of infection is called Rt, which is the effective reproduction number. It takes into account factors such as vaccination levels and immunity from prior exposure and ""is likely lower than the basic reproduction number,"" according to the Health Lab. The Rt value is more of a real-time representation of what a virus’ infection rate is. The effective reproduction number is measured during an ongoing pandemic, and for COVID-19, it also has varied for each strain of the virus. With the original strain, each sick person would infect around 2.5 others; with the delta variant, it was 3.5 to 4; and with omicron, scientists have estimated it between 3.7 and 4.2. When measuring how fast a virus spreads around the world, ""Omicron is certainly the most rapidly spreading virus among the ones we have been able to investigate at this level of detail,"" William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told El Pais, a newspaper in Spain, in an interview. Hanage told PolitiFact that’s because even though each measles infection causes more secondary infections in an unprotected population, it takes longer than omicron to do so. The time it takes one person infected with the omicron variant to infect another person — called the generation time — is shorter than with measles, in a non-immune population. The generation time is about 12 days for measles and four to five days for omicron, El Pais reported. ""As a result of omicron's shorter generation time — and despite its lower R0 — the numbers of omicron cases climb more rapidly per unit of time than measles,"" Hanage said. A Facebook video said, ""Omicron is now the fastest-spreading virus known to humankind."" When it comes to how quickly viruses spread across the world, omicron is the fastest, experts say. When it comes to how viruses are transmitted from person to person, measles is the most contagious. Each person who has measles can infect 12 to 18 other people, in a population not protected by vaccines and other preventative measures, according to the CDC.  But the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is a close second. Estimates put it at 1.5 to 2 times more transmissible than the delta variant, which saw each sick person infecting between five and seven others. So each person who contracts the omicron variant can infect between 7 and 14 people in an unvaccinated, unprotected population. We rate this claim Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A378380>],/factchecks/2022/jan/20/facebook-posts/omicron-variant-fastest-spreading-virus-it-depends/

Biden’s boast about rising wages ignores effect of inflation
","During his long session with reporters to mark his first year in office, President Joe Biden said he’d had both setbacks and wins. He counted wages as one of the wins. ""For the first time in a long time, this country’s working people actually got a raise,"" Biden said Jan. 19. ""The people of the bottom 40% saw their income go up, the most of all the categories."" Here we focus on the heart of that statement, that ""working people actually got a raise.""  In simple dollar amounts, yes, earnings went up. But with inflation at a 40-year high, the real value of people’s paychecks went down. (Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, had a similar problem — but from the opposite direction — weighing inflation against wage gains in a claim we fact-checked.) Two different sets of government numbers tell the same story — inflation outpaced raises. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks median weekly earnings for each quarter. And it gives the numbers in both current dollars — what people see on their pay stubs —  and real dollars — the buying power after inflation. In current dollars — unadjusted for inflation — the typical weekly paycheck was $1,008 in the fourth quarter of 2021, up from $982 a year earlier. But in inflation-adjusted dollars, pay went down over that period to $945 a week. The Federal Reserve shows similar trends for average hourly earnings. Between December 2020 and December 2021, average hourly earnings for private employees rose by 4.7%, which is a healthy increase by historical standards. But inflation, as measured by the federal government’s Consumer Price Index, was 7% in that period. That was the biggest increase since 1982, when President Ronald Reagan was still in his first term in office. ""Wages have increased substantially, but less than inflation,"" said Molly Kinder, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based policy research center.  ""Thus real wages have declined slightly."" The White House press office said Biden was talking about the nominal increase in wages. They noted that most economists expect inflation to ease, which would set the stage for real wage gains. Biden also touted gains for lower-wage earners, ""the bottom 40%."" He said they did the best in terms of income gains. BLS data showed that workers at the bottom quarter of the earnings ladder saw their incomes rise by 6.6%, nearly keeping pace with inflation. But for the middle 50% of workers, earnings rose just about 2.6%. That lagged well behind inflation. The top 10% of earners saw a rise of 5.3%. Workers at large companies did better, one survey found. Brookings took data reported by 13 large companies (ranging from Amazon to McDonalds) and found that through October 2021, workers at 10 of them saw wage gains even after accounting for inflation. Biden said that ""this country’s working people actually got a raise."" They did, with an overall increase of 4.7%. But with inflation at 7%, the average person lost ground in terms of real income. This was particularly true for the middle half of earners who saw a median wage increase of only about 2.5%. The picture was a bit better for low-wage earners, but not enough to shift the broader pattern for 2021: Inflation outpaced wage increases. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809771DC00>],/factchecks/2022/jan/20/joe-biden/bidens-boast-about-rising-wages-ignores-effect-inf/

Claim of FEMA ‘prison camps’ is part of long-running, thoroughly debunked conspiracy theory
","A nearly 8,000-word post circulating on social media claiming the U.S. government has hundreds of prison camps at the ready includes a hodgepodge of debunked conspiracy theories, some that are decades old. ""There (are) over 800 prison camps in the United States, all fully operational and ready to receive prisoners,"" the Jan. 19 post on Facebook says. ""They are all staffed and even surrounded by full-time guards, but they are all empty. These camps are to be operated by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency)."" The claim continues, saying the camps ""all have railroad facilities as well as roads leading to and from the detention facilities. Many also have an airport nearby. The majority of the camps can house a population of 20,000 prisoners."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim is ""absolutely false,"" a FEMA spokesperson told PolitiFact. We found no evidence, in media or government reports or anywhere else, to corroborate the claim. However, there are many reports that debunk false claims about FEMA camps. Information cited in the post as purported proof — including specific executive orders and alleged locations of camps — is misleading or false. None of the concepts in the claim are new; a post with nearly identical opening paragraphs was shared on a Yahoo message board in September 2000. The baseless idea that the U.S. government might try to imprison its citizens in FEMA-run concentration camps has a long history, but the COVID-19 pandemic brought it renewed attention. ""Among certain right-wing conspiracy theorist circles, notably the militia movement, fears of government-imposed martial law, FEMA camps, gun confiscation, and depopulation have been prevalent for decades,"" according to a 2020 report from the Anti-Defamation League. ""Many of these concerns have been updated and applied to the coronavirus, and they are spreading so rampantly that the Department of Defense and local law enforcement agencies have had to address them."" PolitiFact also has debunked claims about FEMA prison camps or detention centers related to COVID-19. The Facebook post says FEMA is associated with specific executive orders which would allow the agency to ""suspend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,"" and lists the numbers of 15 executive orders. PolitiFact reported in 2014 on 14 of the same executive orders, which ""allegedly usurp traditional executive powers, including things like seizing control of the media, railroads, waterways and correctional institutions."" In reality, though, those order numbers matched up with executive orders on either entirely different topics or orders that were much more limited in scope. The executive orders in question originated in 1962, Popular Mechanics reported, when the U.S. was involved in conflicts in both Cuba and Vietnam and the prospect of a Cold War with the Soviet Union loomed. So ""President John F. Kennedy signed a series of executive orders that outlined the basic framework for agency responsibilities during a national emergency."" And rather than allowing the suspension of citizens’ rights, ""safeguards were written into the current framework of responsibilities, declaring that any emergency preparation or actions ‘shall be consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,’"" according to the 2014 article in Popular Mechanics. Almost all of the executive orders have since been revoked. The Facebook post also includes details about where the purported 800 prison camps are located, including Fort Chaffee in Arkansas and Camp Grayling in Michigan. But evidence does not corroborate those claims. For example, the post says that Fort Chaffee ""has new runway for aircraft, new camp facility with cap of 40,000 prisoners."" That same claim was debunked in a 2010 report called ""Fear of FEMA"" from the Southern Poverty Law Center, and there’s no evidence that anything has changed since. A Facebook post says, ""There (are) over 800 prison camps in the United States, all fully operational and ready to receive prisoners. They are all staffed and even surrounded by full-time guards, but they are all empty. These camps are to be operated by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency)."" A FEMA spokesperson said the claim is false. There is no evidence, such as media or government reports, to support the claim. Meanwhile, there are many reports that debunk false claims about FEMA camps.

Texas rabbi not 'anti-Zionist,' no evidence in early investigation and news reports he knew gunman
","Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker was hailed as a hero after news reports described him throwing a chair at an armed hostage-taker on Jan. 15, allowing himself and two others to escape after 11 hours being held captive in a Texas synagogue. But one conservative radio host raised questions about the rabbi, calling him an ""anti-Zionist"" who may have known the gunman because he had invited him inside for tea.  A Facebook post by conservative radio host and author Michael Savage reads in all-caps: ""TEXAS RABBI NOW POSING AS A HERO. 'THREW A CHAIR' and ran out? WHAT ABOUT THE FBI SWAT TEAM WHO FLASHBANGED & SHOT THE TERRORIST DEAD? (something does not add up? Rabbi was a leftist, anti-zionist. Why did he invite this terrorist in to have tea? Did he know him?)"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The investigation into what happened that day is ongoing, but police and news reports so far indicate the gunman was a stranger to Cytron-Walker — and we find nothing to suggest the rabbi was ""anti-Zionist.""  On the morning of the incident, a British national named Malik Faisal Akram took the rabbi and three congregants hostage at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas, northeast of Fort Worth. In a Jan. 17 interview with CBS Mornings, Cytron-Walker said he let the man into the synagogue after he arrived during morning services. The two spoke while the rabbi made them a cup of tea. ""Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,"" Cyrton-Walker said of the conversation he had with the man while preparing tea. In a separate interview with NPR on Jan. 19, the rabbi recounted the interaction again: ""He had come in to get warm. I spoke with him one on one, quietly, that he was welcome to stay for the rest of the service if he had just come in to get warm. And while I was talking with him, he pulled out a gun. It was covered by his coat. And that's how that happened."" Faisal Akram then threatened the hostages over the course of 11 hours, according to police and news reports.  One hostage was released about 5 p.m., but things took a turn hours later, and Cytron-Walker decided he had to act. That’s when he threw the chair at the gunman and told the other hostages to run, according to news reports. We reached out to Savage for evidence of his claim but did not get a response; his post contained no information to undergird his assertions. Neither the FBI nor the Colleyville Police Department have made any comments to suggest that Faisal Akram was anything but a stranger to the rabbi. A spokesperson for the FBI told us the agency couldn’t comment specifically on this claim ""due to the ongoing investigation."" We also reached out to Colleyville Police and did not receive a response. Jennifer Farmer, a spokesperson for the rabbi, told PolitiFact that Cytron-Walker did not know the gunman before they met that day, nor is he anti-Israel. ""The rabbi is not anti-Israel,"" Farmer told us in an email. ""He answered a knock on the window because he thought a human being was in need. He did not know the intentions of this man’s heart.""  Since 2006, Cytron-Walker has been the rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel, which practices Reform Judaism. Its website states that ""we believe in interfaith inclusion and transforming Jewish isolation through engagement, participation and volunteerism."" Cytron-Walker had resigned from his job at the congregation this fall after its board voted to recommend not renewing his contract, according to a report published Jan. 19 in Forward, a nonprofit newspaper covering issues of interest to American Jews. Cytron-Walker will remain in his job until June, when his contract expires, the report said. The rabbi confirmed his resignation in an interview with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, but said the focus should be on his congregation's healing from the hostage ordeal. Cytron-Walker did sign a letter in 2020 in which 10 progressive Jewish groups urged the Israeli government not to annex the West Bank and expressed ""support of the pursuit of a negotiated two-state solution that respects the legitimate national rights and aspirations"" of Israelis and Palestinians.  The rabbi has expressed criticism of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians in sermons, while also defending Israel. Simply criticizing Israel on human rights, however, does not mean you are an anti-Zionist. The Anti-Defamation League defines an anti-Zionist as ""someone who is opposed to the Jewish right to self-determination in the Jewish homeland of Israel,"" according to spokesman Jake Hyman. ""Someone who criticizes annexation (which ADL has done) or is critical of Israeli government policies (which ADL has also done), is not an anti-Zionist,"" Hyman said. Faisal Akram, the gunman, arrived in New York from Britain two weeks before the attack and made his way to Texas, where he reportedly stayed at a homeless shelter in the days leading up to the incident, according to news reports.  According to the BBC, he was the subject of an investigation by MI5, the British security agency, in 2020, but was no longer deemed a threat. His brother told the New York Times that Faisal Akram suffered from mental health issues. During the standoff in Colleyville, Faisal Akram demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Palestinian woman held in federal prison on terrorism charges in Fort Worth, The Associated Press and others reported. Savage in his Facebook post also falsely cast doubt on Cytron-Walker’s heroics, saying the rabbi is ""posing as a hero,"" and asked ""what about the FBI SWAT team who flashbanged & shot the terrorist dead?""  Video from a local ABC station of the end of the standoff clearly shows the three hostages escaping through a side door, followed by the gunman, who quickly ducked back inside. Shortly after, FBI agents raided the building and fatally shot Faisal Akram, the Washington Post reported.  Savage described a Texas rabbi a ""leftist, anti-Zionist"" who may have known the gunman who took him and his congregants hostage on Jan. 15. Rabbi Cytron-Walker has made statements both critical and in support of the Israeli government. But there is no evidence that he meets the definition of an anti-Zionist, according to the ADL. Cytron-Walker indicated in interviews with CBS and NPR that he did not know the gunman — and a spokesperson for the rabbi said he let the man in the building because ""he thought a human being was in need."" Police and news reports so far also indicate the gunman was a stranger to Cytron-Walker. Authorities are still investigating the Jan. 15 event. Based on public information available at this time, we rate this claim False.  PolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097711040>],/factchecks/2022/jan/20/michael-savage/texas-rabbi-not-anti-zionist-no-evidence-early-inv/

Djokovic isn’t the first athlete to be banned from sporting events for being unvaccinated
","After an 11-day ordeal, tennis star Novak Djokovic was deported from Australia after he lost his final bid to stay in the country and play in the Australian Open despite being unvaccinated against COVID-19.  Djokovic, the competition’s record-holder, was initially approved for a medical exemption by Tennis Australia and the state of Victoria because he tested positive for the coronavirus in December. But border officials rejected the exemption and revoked his visa. Djokovic’s challenge to remain in the country was unanimously dismissed in a court hearing on Jan. 16.  The saga culminated in a flurry of social media posts claiming that Djokovic is the first athlete to be banned because he didn’t ""take drugs.""  ""Novak Djokovic becomes the first professional athlete in history to be banned from a major sporting competition for not taking drugs,"" reads one popular Twitter post.  But he is not the first athlete to be prevented from participating in sporting events for not getting the COVID-19 vaccine, nor is he the first to be stopped from competition for refusing to take certain medications. It's also important to note that the tournament didn't ban Djokovic from playing. He was deported because of Australia's COVID-19 policies. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  A high-profile example is Brooklyn Nets basketball player Kyrie Irving, who was told in October that he wouldn’t be able to practice or play for the team until he met New York’s COVID-19 vaccine requirement.   The Nets reversed course about 35 games into the season after a COVID-19 outbreak shortened the roster. Under the new agreement, Irving serves as a part-time player who can participate in most road games but is barred from playing at home in Brooklyn or in away games against the New York Knicks in Madison Square Garden due to New York City’s mandate.  NBA players aren’t required to be vaccinated, but they face stringent testing and social restrictions. The league has said that unvaccinated players won’t be paid for games they miss due to their unvaccinated status. If nothing changes — such as Irving's unvaccinated status or NYC’s mandate —  and the Nets make the playoffs, it will be the first team to ever try to win a title with a lead player only being allowed to play half of every playoff series.  There are other athletes who have been prohibited from participating in a ""major sporting competition"" or event for not taking the vaccine or other medication. There’s professional golfer Charlie Beljan, who said in a now-deleted tweet that he was forced to withdraw from the Professional Golfers’ Association’s Bermuda Championship in October because he ""didn’t take the jab."" Beljan didn’t participate due to Bermuda’s COVID-19 policies, not the PGA’s. South African runner Caster Semenya was ruled ineligible from participating in the summer Olympics in Tokyo because she refused to take medication for a disorder of sexual development, or DSD, a condition that causes her to have naturally elevated levels of testosterone.  ""It’s taking the soul out of my body,"" Semenya told the Guardian in April 2021. ""They want me to take my own system down. I’m not sick. I don’t need drugs. I will never do that."" No major U.S. professional sports league has a vaccine requirement for its players, but some sporting organizations do.

Canada’s committee made a similar announcement in October.  A tweet says that Djokovic is the first athlete to be banned from a major sporting event for ""not taking drugs."" This isn’t accurate.

No, Biden didn’t order media companies to ‘banish voices' that deviate from 'official narrative'
","DirecTV plans to drop One America News Network when its parent company’s contract with the satellite-TV provider expires in April, Bloomberg reported Jan. 14.  The conservative channel was a favorite of Donald Trump’s when he was president, and it has drawn the ire of critics who say that OAN spreads misinformation.

After AT&T bought DirecTV in 2015, it stopped airing OAN. Then Herring sued AT&T, which agreed to carry the channel as part of a settlement.  The DirecTV spokesperson told NPR that the company considers several factors when deciding whether to renew a contract, including in this case whether OAN appealed to a broad enough base of customers.  The Facebook post suggests that DirecTV dropped OAN on Biden’s orders but there’s no evidence to support such claims.
