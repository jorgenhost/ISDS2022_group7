NC Republican says many mass shooters ""turn out to be communist Democrats.""
","Leave it to lawmakers and pundits to ascribe political motivations to people who may have none. It didn’t take long after the shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school for politicians and pundits to speculate on whether the suspect was left- or right-leaning. CNN’s Van Jones retweeted an account that suggested most mass shooters are Republicans. Meanwhile, a state legislator in North Carolina claimed on Facebook that most shooters are ""communist Democrats,"" and a Congresswoman from New York made a similar claim. (Read about her claim here.) In NC, state Rep. Larry Pittman, a Republican state House member from Cabarrus County, near Charlotte, was reacting to a photo on Facebook that purported to show the Parkland shooter wearing a pro-Communism shirt. (It was not the Parkland shooter.) ""So many of these shooters turn out to be communist Democrats, that I suspect they are doing these things to push for gun control so they can more easily take over the country,"" Pittman wrote. The post was later deleted and he apologized. There’s a lot we do know about the people who conduct mass shootings. For instance, they’re mostly white men. They’re usually young. And some have a history of mental illness. As for their political affiliation? Here’s what we found. Mass shooters since Columbine There is no universal definition for mass shootings. We looked at 19 shootings that have received significant national media coverage since the Columbine High School shooting in 1999. More than eight people were killed in each of the shootings. We found very few cases in which the political affiliation of the shooter could be verified. Omar Mateen, the shooter who killed 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016, was registered as a Democrat in 2006. He voted in the Florida primary in 2016, according to reporting from Politico. A dating profile for Chris Harper-Mercer, who killed nine people at a community college in Oregon in 2015, said he was a Republican, according to reporting from CBS News. There was no evidence of his political affiliation beyond the profile. A friend of Aaron Alexis, who killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013, said in a CNN interview that the shooter was ""more of a liberal type."" There were no other reports of his political affiliation. Politicians were the victims of a couple of recent shooting rampages that weren’t on our list of 19 mass shootings. In 2017, 66-year-old James Thomas Hodgkinson shot and injured six people at a congressional baseball game in Virginia — nearly killing House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Hodgkinson volunteered for the presidential campaign of Democrat Bernie Sanders and apparently targeted the Republican team. In 2011, 22-year-old Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in Tucson at an event hosted by Rep. Gabby Giffords, an Arizona Democrat. Loughner killed six and injured 13 others, including Giffords. Authorities reported that he was obsessed with Giffords. Inaccurate reporting There was speculation about the political leanings of some of the other shooters. ABC News falsely reported that James Holmes, who killed 12 people in Colorado in 2012, was a member of the conservative Tea Party. ABC apologized for the error. Breitbart News reported that Holmes may have been a registered Democrat, but also walked back that claim. Holmes’ political affiliation was never verified. Fake news websites claimed Devin Patrick Kelley, who killed 26 people in a Texas church last year, was linked to anti-fascist groups. PolitiFact debunked that claim. Websites made the same claim about Las Vegas shooter Stephen Craig Paddock. We debunked that, too. Paddock wasn’t registered to vote and his family said he didn’t have strong political views, according to a report from Fox News. There were also claims that Adam Lanza, who killed 20 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, was a Democrat. He was not registered to vote, according to the Washington Post. Most recently, our friends at Snopes debunked the claim that Nikolas Cruz, who allegedly killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, was a Democrat. A search of Florida’s voter database yielded no results for Cruz’s party affiliation. There was no reporting on the political leanings of the other 11 shooters. Is it relevant?  Mass shooters are rarely motivated by a political agenda, experts told us. Mass shootings are often perpetrated by young men who are socially isolated or have a mental illness, experience a trauma or conflict that sends them reeling emotionally, and have easy access to guns, said Alan Lipman, professor at George Washington University Medical Center and founder of the Center for the Study of Violence. ""Their motives are almost always, without exception, nonpolitical. And they don’t describe themselves as having a particular political motivation,"" Lipman said. Some — like Dylann Roof, who killed nine people at a church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015 — might channel their rage at a specific group of people, said James Alan Fox, criminologist at Northeastern University and author of ""Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder."" But that doesn’t mean they’re acting on a Republican or Democratic mission, he said. ""Very few are motivated by any sort of political agenda in terms in parties. They might be anti-gay or anti-black or anti-white. You could argue those are political, I guess,"" he said. Even then, those beliefs are often born out of personal vendettas — not political propaganda, said Katherine Ramsland, professor of psychology at DeSales University. ""Look at Stephen Paddock. We don't know his motive,"" Ramsland said in an email, referring to the Las Vegas shooter. ""Devin Kelly — his political affiliation is secondary to his family disputes and need for payback. I just think it's overly simplistic to align a mass shooter's influence with a political ideology unless it's clear from the shooter that this was his (or her) driving issue."" Other experts reacted similarly to the assertion that shooters tend to have common political beliefs. ""Most of the school shooters are children who wouldn’t know a conservative from a communist,"" said Jack Levin, Northeastern professor and co-director of the Brudnick Center on Violence and Conflict. ""The idea of associating politics with these mass murders is absurd. It has absolutely nothing to do with it."" Lipman agreed: ""There is absolutely no evidence to show that mass killings are motivated by political ideologies of any type. All of the mass killings we’ve seen have been motivated by a lethal combination of a small subgroup of mental illnesses, and easy accessibility to weapons of mass killing during the peak symptomatology of those illnesses."" Our ruling Pittman said many perpetrators of mass shootings turn out to be communist Democrats. We found no evidence to support that statement and experts say only a small fraction of mass shooters were motivated by a political agenda. We rate this Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBAF82C0>],/factchecks/2018/feb/23/larry-pittman/nc-republican-says-many-mass-shooters-turn-out-be-/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Dan Patrick']","
Dan Patrick says he proposed directing education budget to drive up teacher salaries $10,000
","Dan Patrick indicates in a campaign video posted in advance of the March 2018 primaries that he’s championed a big bump in teacher pay. The Houston Republican, who seeks a second term as lieutenant governor, says: ""Last year, I proposed directing more of the education budget to teacher salaries, a move that would have resulted in an average $10,000 raise for teachers."" That’d be quite the bump; the state’s 2017-18 salary schedule for teachers runs from $28,080 for starting teachers to $45,510 for a teacher with 20 years experience. We checked whether Patrick, who presides over the Texas Senate, offered the described proposal, ultimately finding that he talked up a desire to tell local school districts to spend money differently but didn't make a proposal affecting state spending overseen by lawmakers. Also, Patrick's district-specific mandate didn't make it into a legislative proposal. Patrick called for directive to school districts As noted in an email we fielded from Patrick campaign spokesman Allen Blakemore, on July 13, 2017, Patrick made a 34-minute presentation to reporters about legislation he expected the  Republican-controlled Senate to advance during a looming 30-day special session called by Gov. Greg Abbott, who’d said the month before that he’d seek action to raise teacher salaries by $1,000 each, an idea that didn’t pass into law. Patrick, pointing out that he’d previously chaired the Senate Education Committee, called public education the ""most important thing we do."" He also noted that 52 percent of available state revenue gets allocated to public and higher education, a claim we later found Mostly True. Education also accounts for the smallest share of budgeted state spending in at least 20 years. Patrick called for lawmakers to direct school districts to shift more budgeted funds to teacher salaries. ""I want the school districts, one of my goals, and it needs to be the goal of the Legislature to direct this,"" to ""increase the amount of money they’re spending by 5 percent over the next four years on teachers,"" Patrick said. That move, he said, would drive up the state’s average teacher salary from more than $51,000 to $60,000. ""Many teachers will make much more, some will make less,"" Patrick said. ""But they all would get about an $8,000 increase if we just take 5 percent of the money that schools are getting. Remember, there’s a lot of room here, there’s a lot of room here. The dollars are in the system."" Patrick continued: ""Now some will say, well, that’s an unfunded mandate. That’s not true. That’s not what the governor is talking about. That’s not what I’m talking about. We’re simply saying prioritize the money for the teachers. If we’re going to have a great education system, we have to attract more teachers to the system, the best and brightest."" In response to a question that day, Patrick said it would be up to districts to decide which budgeted dollars to shift to teacher pay. Patrick also said his plan would be offered as legislation by Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee. Pay-raise idea not written into legislation Nelson, legislative records show, subsequently carried Senate Bill 19 through the Senate. A revised version of the proposal later died in the House. Yet it looks to us like Patrick’s pay-raise directive didn’t make it into SB 19. Nelson’s office didn’t respond to our inquiries about that. But in her initial filed version of the proposal, introduced July 20, 2017, the ""Classroom Teacher Salary Increases"" section called only for each district to increase teacher salaries by spending $1,000 more per teacher from available funds in a manner determined by the local school board. That amount aligned with Abbott's expressed desire. Two days later, the Nelson-led panel advanced SB 19 to the Senate after representatives of teacher groups testified that they couldn't fully support the plan because the envisioned raises weren’t accompanied by more state aid, the Austin American-Statesman reported at the time. ""According to Nelson's office,"" the newspaper said, ""the Legislature next session will have to decide how to pay for the bill's $750 million pay raise provision, which wouldn't take effect until the 2019-2020 school year,"" the story said. Nelson reportedly told teacher groups in response: ""It’s this or nothing."" In the end, records show, the $1,000 raise language was no longer in SB 19 when the Senate advanced it to the House, though the revised legislation kept alive language stating that subject to available funding, the Texas Education Agency shall provide annual bonuses to classroom teachers based on years of experience--which Patrick also had offered as an idea in his presentation. A later version of SB 19, as amended and advanced by a House panel, had no provisions for raises or bonuses. State funding for bonuses? According to news reports, the initial bonuses were to be funded by lawmakers delaying Medicaid managed-care payments for two years though Patrick favored sending voters a proposed constitutional amendment to allocate money for the bonuses from state lottery revenues. Lottery revenue was already dedicated to school funding. But Senate Joint Resolution 1, introduced July 20, 2017 by Sen. Konni Burton, R-Fort Worth, called for requiring half of revenues generated by the lottery for education to be used to pay for salary increases and bonuses for classroom teachers with at least six years of experience and related retirement contributions, according to its fiscal note. ""As a result, school districts would have less available revenue to fund all other operations,"" the fiscal note states. Records show a Senate committee held a hearing on the proposal, which wasn’t sent to the full Senate. A related measure, SB 97 by Sen. Charles Perry, R-Lubbock, also didn't advance. School groups say Patrick didn't make valid proposal Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials, among advocates for school employees responding to our inquiry about Patrick’s claim, said of SB 19: ""A bonus is not a pay raise."" Canby noted too that the legislation’s specified bonus amounts--$600 or $1,000, based on years of experience--fell short of Patrick’s envisioned $10,000. Lonnie Hollingsworth, Jr., of the Texas Classroom Teachers Association offered us his calculation indicating that if districts had been required to set aside 5 percent of operating expenditures in the 2016-2017 school year to boost teacher salaries, the resulting raises would average $6,708. ""Theoretically, it would be possible to increase teacher salaries by requiring districts to reallocate existing funding,"" Hollingsworth said by email, ""but we have never seen a mechanism that would accomplish this. Our preferred approach is for increased state funding with a requirement for a commensurate increase in teacher salaries."" Clay Robison of the Texas State Teachers Association similarly emphasized by email that Patrick didn’t call for state aid to pay for raises. Mark Wiggins, a lobbyist for the Association for Texas Professional Educators, said by email that ""legislation to give teachers a $10,000 raise was never even filed."" Our ruling Patrick said: ""Last year, I proposed directing more of the education budget to teacher salaries, a move that would have resulted in an average $10,000 raise for teachers."" Patrick made no proposal to direct more of the state's education budget to teacher salaries. Rather, he told reporters that lawmakers should tell school districts to set aside more money for such salaries by reducing other expenditures. That idea, which Patrick said would boost the average salary by $8,000, never got written into a legislative proposal. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['New York', 'Guns', 'Claudia Tenney']","
Do many mass shooters 'end up being Democrats', as Rep. Tenney said? No
","An upstate New York member of Congress made national headlines when she suggested many mass shooters were Democrats. Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-Utica, was speaking with a radio host from Albany, N.Y., about how to prevent future mass shootings when she made the claim. ""It's interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats, but the media doesn't talk about that either,"" Tenney said on Feb. 21, 2018. The host of the radio show did not ask Tenney to back up her claim, but several reporters on Twitter did. Her office sent out a statement from Tenney that evening: ""I am fed up with the media and liberals attempting to politicize tragedies and demonize law-abiding gun owners and conservative Americans every time there is a horrible tragedy,"" Tenney said in the statement. ""While we know the perpetrators of these atrocities have a wide variety of political views, my comments are in response to a question about the failure to prosecute illegal gun crime. I will continue to stand up for law-abiding citizens who are smeared by anti-gun liberal elitists."" Tenney did not answer questions about her claim at a press event the next day. Her office has not provided any support for the claim. (A lawmaker in North Carolina made a similar claim this week as well. Read more about that here.) We wondered if there was any truth to Tenney’s claim. Do many mass shooters turn out to be Democrats? There is no universal definition for mass shootings.

"['National', 'Guns', 'Everytown for Gun Safety']","
Did NRA's LaPierre once call for gun-free schools?
","Just about a week after the deadly shooting at a Florida high school, the National Rifle Association’s vice president Wayne LaPierre delivered the group’s response: more armed guards in schools. ""Our banks, our airports, our NBA games, our NFL games, our office buildings, our movie stars, our politicians — they are all more protected than our children at school,"" Lapierre said at the Conservative Political Action Committee Feb. 22. ""To stop a bad guy with a gun, it takes a good guy with a gun."" LaPierre had barely stepped down from the stage when the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety tweeted this blast from LaPierre’s past. #tbt to Wayne LaPierre in 1999. #CPAC pic.twitter.com/oVfq3VR9zs The group quoted LaPierre as saying in 1999, ""We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally safe schools.That means no guns in America’s schools. Period."" There are a few angles to consider here. Did LaPierre say those words? Yes, he did. It was May 1, 1999, 10 days after two teenage boys killed 13 people, wounded more than 20 others and then committed suicide at Columbine High School in Colorado. LaPierre spoke at the NRA’s annual convention and called for a policy banning guns from school. But LaPierre said more than what the Everytown group quoted. He was talking about guns brought to school by students, not teachers or trained security. ""Of the 6,000 young people the president acknowledges were caught with a gun at school during the past two years, we believe all of them should have been prosecuted,"" LaPierre said. ""But the truth is only five were prosecuted in 1997. And just eight were prosecuted in 1988. That's not zero tolerance."" LaPierre made a passing reference to armed guards in schools, referring to ""the rare exception of law enforcement officers or trained security personnel."" As for arming teachers, something President Donald Trump has shown a keen interest in, LaPierre said nothing. In his 1999 speech, his emphasis was on what adults should do to keep weapons out of the hands of teens. LaPierre said the NRA held adults responsible. ""Just as every kid should have a guardian who knows where he is and keeps him safe, every firearm should have a guardian who knows where it is and keeps it safely stored,"" LaPierre said. Columbine horrified the nation in its scale and the cold-blooded method of the high school seniors who had spent a year planning their attack. The Senate passed a bill to strengthen background checks, but it died in the House. The slaughter prompted more discussion of early identification of loners, and more emphasis on school security. Keeping weapons out of the hands of minors gained more attention. The 2012 shootings in Newtown, Conn., that took the lives of 26 elementary students and one of their teachers was the signature event when LaPierre spoke forcefully about a good guy with a gun being the best response to a bad guy with a gun. His rhetoric in 2012 was the same as when he spoke in 2018. ""American airports, office buildings, power plants, courthouses, even sports stadiums are all protected by armed security,"" LaPierre said at a news conference Dec. 21, 2012. ""Yet, when it comes to our most beloved, innocent, and vulnerable members of the American family, our children, we as a society leave them every day utterly defenseless."" In 2012, LaPierre called on Congress to immediately ""appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every single school in this nation."" Everytown for Gun Safety tweeted the reminder that nearly two decades ago, LaPierre said, ""We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally safe schools. That means no guns in America’s schools. Period."" The quotation is accurate, but it takes LaPierre’s words out of context. His full message was that adults should keep weapons out of the hands of minors and that schools and localities should act swiftly to punish any student caught bringing a firearm to school. In 1999, LaPierre also left open the door for armed security on school grounds, but that was not the focus of the policy debate at the time. That option has since risen on the NRA’s agenda. The Everytown tweet has a measure of truth, but it leaves out important context that changes the meaning behind LaPierre’s words. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD602C0>],/factchecks/2018/feb/23/everytown-gun-safety/did-nras-lapierre-once-call-gun-free-schools/
"['Florida', 'Guns', 'Philip Levine']","
14 school shootings since 2010 in Florida? Not really
","In the wake of the Parkland, Fla. shooting, Democratic candidate for governor Philip Levine released a TV ad promoting tighter gun restrictions and documenting an alarming number of school shootings in the state. Levine, the former mayor for Miami Beach released the 30-second ad after the Feb. 14 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that killed 17 people. Levine will face several other Democratic challengers in the primary on Aug. 28. ""When we send our children off to school, we want to know they're safe,"" Levine says as he steps off a school bus. ""But here in Florida, despite 14 school shootings in eight years, we still have some of the weakest gun laws in the nation."" Have there really been 14 school shootings in Florida since 2010, and does Florida have some of the weakest gun laws in the nation? There isn’t one uniform way to track school shootings in the United States. Methodologies and definitions vary with each group collecting data, offering a range of numbers on the prevalence of school shootings in recent years. To back up Levine’s claim, spokesman Christian Ulvert sent PolitiFact Florida a list of 14 events that he described as school shootings. Ulvert said he compiled the list after vetting news articles about shootings. Wikipedia also lists 14 school shootings in Florida over the past eight years. Ulvert also sent along a tweet from WFTV investigative and political reporter Christopher Heath who reiterated the statistic. The list indeed includes 14 incidents in the last eight years (actually since 2012). But the descriptions and circumstances of many of the events are quite different than what occurred in Parkland. Date Location Details March 6, 2012 Episcopal School of Jacksonville Shane Schumerth, a Spanish teacher who had been fired, went to the Episcopal School of Jacksonville armed with an AK-47. Schumerth shot and killed the Head of the School, Dale Regan. Schumerth then killed himself in the office. Jan. 7, 2013 Apostolic Revival Center Christian School, Fort Myers, Florida Kristopher Smith, 27, was killed by gunshots fired at the school. Police believed it to be a retaliation killing, possibly for speaking with police about a previous event. A news report does not mention who killed Smith, including if that person was a student. March 18, 2013 University of Central Florida James Oliver Seevakumaran, 30-year-old student, pulled a fire alarm at the Tower One dormitory to attract a crowd. After threatening to shoot his roommate; he released the roommate, who ran out and called 9-1-1. Seevakumaran then fatally shot himself in the head. Oct. 4, 2013 Outside Agape Christian Academy A 16-year-old student was shot in the hip outside of the academy after a fight broke out. An innocent bystander was hit by a stray bullet or shrapnel. Two victims were treated for minor injuries. Dec. 4, 2013 Near a soccer field on the campus of West Orange High School A 17-year-old student shot and injured a 15-year-old student near a soccer field on campus. Jan. 30, 2014 Parking lot of Eastern Florida State College A student and two others were fighting in a parking lot when the student pulled out a gun and shot one of the men in the chest.   March 12, 2014 Behind the Academy of Knowledge Preschool An elementary school teacher was shot and killed by her husband. Sept. 9, 2014 Parking lot of Stellar Leadership Academy in northwest Miami-Dade After a fight broke out, someone fired a gun. One person was injured. Nov. 20, 2014 Near the Strozier Library at Florida State University A gunman opened fire on FSU’s campus, leaving three students injured before he was killed by campus police. Nov. 20, 2014 Miami Carol City High School Two teenagers were shot during a fight. One boy died. Jan. 16, 2015 Parking lot of Vanguard High School in Ocala, Fla. A gunman opened fired in the parking lot, injuring one 14-year-old girl and a 19-year-old woman. (Woman was cut by glass) Feb. 23, 2015 Music building at Bethune-Cookman University Two students were arguing and one pulled out a gun. Three students were injured. May 12, 2015 Jacksonville (a school bus on 118th Street) A 16-year-old student was accused of firing five bullets at a school bus. Two students were injured. Feb. 14, 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting A 19-year-old former student began shooting students and staff members with a semi-automatic rifle, killing 17 people and leaving 14 more injured. So there are 14 documented incidents in which a gun was fired inside a school or on or near school property since 2012. Of those shootings shootings: Seven involved no deaths; Four occurred during a fight between specific people or students; Three of the seven incidents that resulted in deaths did not involve students; One was an incident between a wife and her husband. We presented the list from Levine’s office to Jaclyn Schildkraut, an assistant professor in the Department of Public Justice at the State University of New York at Oswego. Schildkraut said she only considered two of the incidents ""school shootings"" — the Feb. 14 shooting at Stoneman Douglas and the Nov. 20, 2014, shooting at Florida State University. She said the shooters at Stoneman Douglas and FSU had similar motivations, unlike the other incidents on the list that happened after or during an altercation.    ""He goes into a place that he knows is populated and randomly starts shooting,"" she said. ""It’s not targeted violence like the fights and the case where a woman was shot by her husband."" To back this point up, Ulvert sent PolitiFact Florida a link to an NBC News article that cited a 2016 report from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that supports more restrictive gun regulation. Florida does have weak gun laws based on this analysis, but saying it has some of the weakest requires context. According to the report, Florida received an F for its gun laws, the lowest grade a state can receive. But so did 24 other states. Grades are assigned based on how many ""points"" a state earns. The more points, the better the grade. For example, states can earn points if they require a background check for every firearm sale and lose points for laws that allow people to carry concealed, loaded guns in public without a permit, among other things. In a news release, Giffords Law Center also notes that in 2016 Florida had ""the nation’s 26th highest gun death rate … and was ranked the 26th worst state for firearm laws."" Giffords said Mississippi received the worst score in 2016. While Mississippi received an F last year, its ranking dropped from 49 to 50 because it enacted a law that allows people to carry hidden, loaded guns in public without a license. Following the shooting, Giffords Law wrote a news brief pointing out some of Florida’s permissive laws, which included the state’s pre-emption law that sought to prevent local governments from passing new gun restrictions on their own. The organization claims the law was ""designed to severely restrict local authority to regulate firearms."" It also said that Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law was amended recently to make it ""even more dangerous."" Levine said that ""despite 14 school shootings in eight years (in Florida), we still have some of the weakest gun laws in the nation."" Levine can count 14 instances in the past eight years where guns were discharged on school grounds. But describing those 14 instances as school shootings is misleading, an expert told us, particularly when compared with, and in the context of, the shooting in Parkland. A group that supports tighter gun restrictions, meanwhile, says that Florida does have weak gun laws. But two dozen states share that same description.

Lt. governor's count of Wisconsin job openings includes some out-of-state positions
","Discussing the administration’s 2018 agenda on a Milwaukee radio show late last year, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch said Wisconsin had an ""extraordinary amount of jobs"" but not enough workers with the right skills. For proof she turned to a state-run jobs database. ""The best illustration of this … is called JobCenterOfWisconsin.com,"" Kleefisch told Steve Scaffidi on his WTMJ radio show Dec. 21, 2017. ""You're going to see that on a day-to-day basis, we have roughly between 85,000 (and) 95,000 open jobs in Wisconsin, and yet, we only have about 40,000 folks who are currently on unemployment."" Does Wisconsin really have between 85,000 and 95,000 available jobs? Time to dive into the data. Database a mix of sources The site — run by the state Department of Workforce Development — includes jobs posted there directly by businesses or workforce department staffers and those provided by a third-party jobs aggregator. A snapshot of the database provided by DWD from Jan. 8, 2018, shortly after Kleefisch’s statement, showed a total of 83,077 jobs. About 39,000 jobs were posted directly to the site, 43,000 came from US.jobs and 1,000 from America’s Job Exchange. US.jobs, also called the National Labor Exchange, is a national jobs clearinghouse that retrieves jobs at least once a day from numerous companies’ internal job tracking systems. The service provides about 60% of the job listings to all state job databases in the country, said Hal Cooper, vice president of product development for the DirectEmployers Association, which coordinates the database. The number of jobs in the Wisconsin database varies by season. In 2017, it hit a high of 104,000 in May. It was just under 90,000 the day before Kleefisch’s comment, according to copies of the site maintained by archive.org. Out-of-state, old jobs included in listing So the totals are in line with Kleefisch’s claim. But a closer look at the data shows the matter is not quite that simple. The jobs database includes about 14,000 positions located in Wisconsin’s four neighboring states -- Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Michigan. One of the 15 most common entries in the ""employer"" field in the database is Access Dubuque, a jobs clearinghouse in Iowa. John Dipko, a workforce development spokesman, said the jobs are included because job seekers ""typically look for openings within a particular radius of their home,"" even if that crosses state lines. He said many of those jobs are ""still performed"" in Wisconsin through telecommuting or travel. Dan Suhr, Kleefisch’s interim chief of staff, noted the database topped 100,000 in the months preceding her comment, and removing the out-of-state jobs from that number would still leave a total near the low end of the range she cited. The database also contained some entries that appeared to be duplicates. For example, Arby’s restaurants had 16 identical postings that each sought three assistant managers to work in La Crosse County — a total of 48 jobs. Arby’s has one location in La Crosse County. There were also 12 postings for three Arby’s managers each in Brown County, more than the number of restaurants there. But such cases did not appear widespread. Several of the companies with the highest number of jobs in the database confirmed the tallies were accurate. A dozen companies in the database combined for more than 12,000 job listings as of Jan. 8. Roehl Transport had the highest number of jobs in the database at 2,174, and a spokesman said the nationwide driving shortage means there is essentially no limit to the number of drivers they would hire. Spokesmen for Ascension Health (1,080 jobs), Froedtert Health (663) and Walgreens (635) said those numbers are roughly accurate. Job listings on Kwik Trip’s website appear to show a roughly similar number of jobs to the state database. Among other large employers, a McDonald’s spokesman said they don’t maintain a jobs total for all Wisconsin franchises, and Pizza Hut and Dollar General did not respond to requests for confirmation. Dipko and Cooper said they have systems in place to keep outdated jobs out of the database. The internally posted jobs are removed after 90 days if employers don’t update them, and the outside ones from US.jobs are updated daily from the company servers, so those are also presumed up-to-date. The database provided included 3,900 listings that were first posted more than a year ago, but Dipko and Cooper attributed those to job listing IDs being reused or jobs remaining open. Our rating While making a point about the gap between Wisconsin’s job-seekers and available jobs, Kleefisch claimed in late December that Wisconsin had ""roughly"" 85,000 to 95,000 open jobs on a state website. The database stood at 90,000 the day before her comment and totalled 82,000 a couple weeks later in the version released to PolitiFact. But an examination of the 82,000 jobs showed only 69,000 were actually based in Wisconsin. It’s reasonable to include those out-of-state jobs in a database for Wisconsin job seekers, but those aren’t Wisconsin jobs. The in-state listings appear largely legitimate, based on checks with the largest employers and a search for repeated or out-of-date listings. But that is still short of the range Kleefisch asserted. The database changed somewhat between her statement and the data we analyzed, but not by enough to put the Wisconsin tally in line with her statement. We rate her claim Half True. (Editor's note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly listed Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin, rather than Froedtert Health, which covers jus tthe Froedtert portion of the operation).",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE4D740>],/factchecks/2018/feb/23/rebecca-kleefisch/lt-governors-count-wisconsin-job-openings-includes/

Florida Gov. Rick Scott made it illegal for doctors to talk to patients about guns, TV ad says
","A TV ad airing in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting targets Florida Gov. Rick Scott over his support for a controversial gun measure. The ad was produced by Giffords, an organization that fights gun violence and is named for former Arizona U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Giffords was shot in the head in 2011. The ad references three recent Florida shootings, in Parkland, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, and then goes after Scott. ""We need to stop dangerous people from getting guns. But Gov. Rick Scott made it illegal for a doctor to ask a patient if they owned a gun, even a mental health professional. This law was so dangerous that a court had to strike it down."" Does the ad cast Scott’s position, and the reaction of the court, correctly? We decided to find out. The law behind the ad, ‘docs vs. glocks’ In 2011, Florida lawmakers crafted a bill to strengthen patient protection related to firearms after hearing a report of a woman in Central Florida who was turned away from her pediatrician. The bill said that health care providers couldn’t ask questions to patients or their families about whether they own a gun, unless the provider ""believes that this information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others."" It also stated that health care providers couldn’t discriminate against patients because they own firearms. The penalties included facing fines up to $10,000 or loss of a medical license. The bill passed the House and Senate, with a few Democrats joining in with Republicans to support the plan. Scott signed the bill into law on June 2, 2011. The ad correctly says the law applied to a ""mental health professional"" because Florida law defines health care practitioners as including those who are licensed to provide psychological, clinical, counseling, and psychotherapy services. But did the law make it illegal for a doctor to ask a patient if they owned a gun? The 2011 law didn’t expressly state that doctors couldn’t ask patients if they owned a gun. But it did limit their ability to do so by stating that providers ""should refrain from making a written inquiry or asking questions concerning the ownership of a firearm"" unless in ""good faith"" they believe ""that this information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others, may make such a verbal or written inquiry."" The law failed to detail what would qualify as meeting that standard. Critics say it created a chilling effect for doctors who stopped asking questions out of fear they would face discipline. After nearly six years of litigation, in February 2017 the 11th Circuit Federal Appeals Court ruled that some provisions of the law were unconstitutional, including the part that prevented providers from asking patients about guns. The bill’s ""record-keeping and inquiry provisions prevent doctors and medical professionals from asking all patients, or all patients with children, whether they own firearms or have firearms in their homes, or from recording answers to such questions."" A medical professional, for example, would violate the law ""if he or she gives all new patients an intake questionnaire which asks about firearms in the home,"" the court wrote. The ruling addressed the danger of the law in a few ways. First, the court addressed the danger of doctors facing a ""credible threat of prosecution."" The court wrote that when the alleged danger of legislation is self-censorship harm, ""can be realized even without an actual prosecution."" Second, the court concluded that the legislation did not provide a means by which patients could hear from their doctors about firearms and firearm safety. In the fields of medicine and public health ""information can save lives"" and doctors, therefore, ""must be able to speak frankly and openly to patients,"" the court wrote. The court wrote that some medical organizations believe that unsecured firearms increase risks of injuries and are a leading cause of death for some age groups. That’s why major medical groups ""recommend that doctors and pediatricians routinely ask patients about firearm ownership, and educate them about the dangers posed to children by firearms that are not safely secured."" Thomas Julin, a First Amendment lawyer who represented a coalition of medical groups as ""friends of the court,"" told PolitiFact that the court was not attempting to determine whether the law was so dangerous that it had to strike it down. ""It was trying to determine whether the state had sufficient evidence to show that the law would advance the interests that it supposedly had been enacted to serve,"" he wrote.   However, the law did create a danger that health care providers would censor their own speech -- which they did do to avoid possible discipline. ""When one speaks of the law being dangerous, I think most people would understand that to mean not simply that it created a danger of self-censorship, but that the law deterred health care providers from providing advice to patients that would be used to prevent firearm accidents,"" Julin said.  ""I think that is a fair characterization of what the law likely did because it apparently did deter health care providers not only from making inquiries of their patients but also from providing advice to their patients regarding the dangers of firearms and ammunition ownership and how that could be mitigated.""      We asked Scott’s press office if he had any evidence to refute the claims in the ad, but his spokeswoman did not directly answer our question and said that Scott was ""focused on finding real solutions to keep students safe."" Scott showed support when the Legislature passed the bills. ""I look forward to seeing those bills,"" Scott said in April 2011. ""I believe in the right to bear arms."" A Giffords TV ad said, ""Gov. Rick Scott made it illegal for a doctor to ask a patient if they owned a gun, even a mental health professional. This law was so dangerous that a court had to strike it down."" Scott didn’t act alone -- he signed the law after the Legislature passed it in 2011. The bill didn’t flat out prevent doctors from asking patients if they owned a gun, but said they should refrain from asking about guns unless they believed in good faith the information was relevant to the patient’s medical care or safety. That was a vague standard, which effectively silenced some doctors, critics claimed. A federal appeals court ruled in 2017 that the inquiry provisions prevented medical professionals from asking questions about firearms. The ruling also stated that doctors faced the threat of discipline and doctors must be able to speak openly with patients to provide life-saving information. As a result of these caveats, we rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC939F80>],/factchecks/2018/feb/22/giffords/florida-gov-rick-scott-made-it-illegal-doctors-tal/

Fact-checking a misleading post on ID requirements for buying guns, voting
","After a teenage gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., Americans of all political persuasions flocked to social media to express their views on gun policy. On the pro-gun control side of the argument, Areva Martin, an author and TV commentator, tweeted a graphic that showed in most of the country, it is harder to vote than it is to buy an assault rifle. She shared the following graphic with the comment, ""Just let this sink in! #FloridaSchoolShooting #Florida #GunReformNow."" Just let this sink in! #FloridaSchoolShooting #Florida #GunReformNow pic.twitter.com/h5EvrgDwsY However, a closer look at both gun policy and election law suggest some important caveats that the graphic leaves out. (Martin did not reply to an inquiry from her representative.) Unlike many viral images we see, this one provided its sourcing. It cited an article by Alex Seitz-Wald in Salon.com and the liberal Center for American Progress. The chart was put together from elements of the Salon article by Adam Peck, an editor with the website ThinkProgress, which is affiliated with the Center for American Progress. Peck told PolitiFact that the graphic was originally created to be embedded in a separate Think Progress article. The accompanying ThinkProgress article ""was our opportunity to provide readers with the kind of information and nuance that simply don't work in a visual capacity,"" Peck said. ""Obviously, the pitfall is that those graphics can be easily divorced from their companion articles, losing whatever nuance we set out to provide."" Also important to note: The Salon article, the ThinkProgress article and the graphic were all published in 2013. (Seitz-Wald has been at NBC News since 2014.) So the underlying data is five years old. The meme’s re-emergence means there’s been a game of telephone, with notable context falling by the wayside. Student survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School gather at the capitol in Tallahassee, Fla., on Feb. 21, 2018. (AP/Mark Wallheiser) You wouldn’t know it from the graphic, but whether an ID is required for a gun sale depends on who is making the sale. Under federal law, federally licensed gun dealers, importers and manufacturers must run background checks for sales to an unlicensed buyer. Specifically, a potential purchaser must show identification, complete a federal document known as a Form 4473, and pass a National Instant Criminal Background Check System check. Where the meme has a point is that in the states that didn’t pass a tougher law, unlicensed private sellers are exempted from having to complete the background check process. Commonly, such unlicensed sellers operate from gun shows or flea markets, although a licensed dealer selling from a show would have to run the background check. ""For anyone who thinks he or she might not pass a background check, or is looking to circumvent any waiting period, they can bypass both in a majority of states,"" said Peck, the graphic's creator. As Seitz-Wald noted in his article, states can add their own restrictions on top of these requirements. At the time the article was written, only about a third had done so. Since then, Oregon and Washington have begun requiring background checks (and thus an ID) on all gun sales, including private transfers. This distinction — between the rules for licensed sellers and for unlicensed sellers — didn’t make it into the meme. That matters. While it is possible in many states to buy a firearm without an ID by seeking out an unlicensed seller, such purchases account for a fraction of all sales. Gun shops and other types of brick-and-mortar stores — where background checks are required — account for a majority of purchases. A research paper published last year in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that of the 70 percent of gun transfers studied that were purchases — as opposed to gifts and inheritances — 53 percent were purchased from stores and 17 percent were purchased from family, friends, online or gun shows. Those percentages have increased over time. In the past two years, 64 percent were purchased at stores. In other words, it’s certainly possible to purchase a gun without an ID in many states, but in reality, a large majority of purchases are done with IDs and background checks. The graphic is more problematic on the point that in no state can you vote without proof of ID. It’s certainly true that a number of states have requirements for voters to hand over a government-issued photo ID in one of just a few categories, such as driver’s licenses. The strictest of these include Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Other states also have ID requirements to vote, but in many cases, they allow easier-to-obtain paperwork, including documents without a photograph in some cases. Some of the valid documents, depending on the state, include student ID cards, utility bills, bank statements, paychecks, government checks, Medicare or Medicaid cards, employer ID cards, or a bank or debit card. Finally, there are 16 states that do not currently require documents at polling booths at all. They are California, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wyoming. So the notion that every state requires an ID to vote is incorrect. If the graphic had said that an ID is required to register to vote, it would have been somewhat more accurate. Under the federal Help America Vote Act, every state must request identification when registering first-time voters who did not register in person and did not provide identification when filling out the mail-in registration form. For these voters, a wide variety of documents are accepted for registration; many states allow some of the non-photo IDs cited above to serve that purpose. The viral image said that in most states, you can buy an assault rifle with no proof of ID, but in every state, you need proof of ID to vote. It is indeed possible to buy an assault rifle without an ID if you go to a gun show — but the graphic neglects to mention that these sales are the exception rather than the rule. A significant majority of gun purchases are made in transactions that require ID and a background check. As for the voting claim, some states have imposed strict photo ID laws at the voting booth. However, the graphic ignores that about one-third of states require no ID at all to vote, and that many of those that do require identification allow a range of documents to serve that purpose, including student IDs, utility bills and debit cards. We rate the viral image Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC13D00>],/factchecks/2018/feb/22/viral-image/fact-checking-meme-id-requirements-buying-guns-vot/

VP Mike Pence says government nabbing 7 terrorists or suspected terrorists a day on southern border
","Vice President Mike Pence says terrorists are getting caught at the U.S.-Mexico border day after day. In his Feb. 17, 2018, remarks in Dallas, Pence mentioned his visit the day before to the port inside the Hidalgo-Reynosa International Bridge in Hidalgo, a border town in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley. ""We’ve made progress but we still have work to do,"" Pence said. According to the White House transcript, Pence went on: ""I learned yesterday at the Hidalgo border center that along the southern border of the United States, we actually still apprehend 1,100 individuals a day, who are attempting to enter this country illegally, including seven individuals a day who are either known or suspected terrorists."" ""So men and women, let me say, we’re going to continue to work to secure our borders,"" Pence said next. ""We’re going to reform a broken immigration system. And make no mistake about it, we’re going to build that wall,"" Pence said to applause. We sought to verify Pence’s declaration that seven suspected or known terrorists are daily getting nabbed at the border. The FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center says in a FAQ last updated in January 2017 that a ""known terrorist"" is an individual who’s been arrested, charged or convicted in the U.S. or abroad of a crime related to terrorism or terrorist-related activities--or a person identified as a terrorist or member of a terrorist organization ""pursuant to statute, executive order, or international legal obligation pursuant to a United Nations Security Council resolution."" A suspected terrorist, the FBI says, is an individual reasonably suspected to have engaged in or currently or about to be engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism and/or terrorist activities. Total apprehensions in border region We didn’t draw fresh information when we asked the White House about the basis of Pence’s reference to border apprehensions. Separately, Carlos Diaz, a Customs and Border Protection spokesman, suggested that we review that agency’s latest counts of individuals apprehended by the government along the U.S.-Mexico border. In January 2018, the month before Pence spoke, CBP says, 35,822 individuals were apprehended in the Southwest Border region, which takes in the more than 2,000 miles from Brownsville, Texas, to San Diego. That breaks out to 1,155 apprehended people a day. No data for terrorists apprehended at border Best we could tell, though, the statistics pointed out by Diaz don’t include counts of deterred or detained terrorists or suspected terrorists--a judgment shared, when we asked for help, by Alex Nowrestah, an analyst for the Cato Institute, which published a 2016 paper finding that foreign-born terrorists who entered the country, either as immigrants or tourists, were responsible for 88 percent (or 3,024) of the 3,432 murders caused by terrorists on U.S. soil from 1975 through the end of 2015. By email, Nowrestah told us he was unaware of statistics supporting Pence’s seven-a-day statement about the U.S.-Mexico border. Generally, Nowrestah suggested we attempt our own ballpark estimate starting from a Department of Homeland Security table tallying ""aliens"" apprehended nationally in 2016 (the latest year of compiled data) by countries of origin--putting our focus on the number of individuals stopped from entering from countries that President Donald Trump seeks to bar U.S. visitors. Taking this approach, we found that 211 of the people apprehended in 2016 hailed from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen (with no one apprehended from another travel-ban country, North Korea)--less than a person a day. An alternate claim Another expert helped us identify a seven-a-day claim that has factual footing. By email, David Sterman, an analyst with the New America think tank, which has compiled information on terrorist activities in the United States after 9/11, pointed out that in January 2018, the Justice Department and Homeland Security released a report supporting a seven-a-day calculation. A government press release and the report itself each say that  in 2017, Homeland Security  ""had 2,554 encounters with individuals on the terrorist watch list (also known as the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Database) traveling to the United States,"" which breaks out to seven individuals a day. Pence made such a statement during his visit to Hidalgo, according to a McAllen Monitor news story on his visit. The story quoted the vice president saying: ""Homeland Security, I am told, refuses entry to seven known or suspected individuals who may have terrorist intent in this country every day, or roughly 2,500 a year."" The 2018 report says: ""Where consistent with the law, such individuals are denied entry into the United States, while in some cases law enforcement authorities are notified and can take appropriate action."" The report further says: ""This data only includes individuals of which the United States encountered and not all of those who may have entered or attempted to enter the country undetected."" Most stopped at airports? In Dallas, Pence said the seven daily apprehensions were taking place along the southern border. But in 2017, according to the report, most of the deterred individuals were stopped from entering by airplane--not necessarily at the border. According to the report, of the 2,554 individuals, 335 were attempting to enter by land, 2,170 were attempting to enter by air and 49 were attempting to enter by sea. Also by email, Sterman cautioned that being on a watch list ""is not the same as being a terrorism suspect. It’s a vast architecture that includes many names for varying levels of concern. Denying entry is a low bar to clear. Which is part of the reason citing this number to defend the immigration-centric counterterrorism strategy is misleading. It’s more of a sign that a lot is already done."" We sought the FBI’s comment on whether people on the watch list consists of known terrorists and suspected terrorists and didn’t immediately hear back. Our ruling Pence said in Dallas that ""along the southern border of the U.S.,"" the government apprehends ""seven individuals a day who are either known or suspected terrorists."" We found no facts that back up this border-specific tally. Nationally in 2017, the federal government says, Homeland Security stopped 2,554 individuals on its terrorist watch list from entering the country, which breaks out to seven people a day. Most of those individuals tried to enter by air, the government says. We rate Pence’s claim Pants on Fire. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Why you shouldn't believe claims that Stoneman Douglas students are crisis actors
","Multiple internet bloggers are falsely accusing David Hogg, a student survivor of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., of being a paid actor with a past of pushing for additional restrictions on guns. The conspiracy theories spread to the mainstream when Benjamin Kelly, an aide for Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison, R-Tampa, told a reporter that Hogg and another student were ""actors"" who ""travel to various crisis (sic) when they happen."" Here's the email. I asked for more information to back up the claim and was sent another email that linked to a YouTube conspiracy video. pic.twitter.com/VRSVOcjj3E The aide was fired, and the Broward County School District said Hogg and his classmate are ""absolutely students at Stoneman Douglas."" Here are the facts. Conspiracy theorists have latched on to a CBS news video of Hogg in Los Angeles from 2017 as evidence that the teen might be a plant. Hogg posted a video that showed an argument between his friend and a lifeguard on Redondo Beach. The argument was unrelated to guns. After Hogg’s friend put a boogie board on a trash can on the beach, a lifeguard asked him to remove it. The friend complied with the lifeguard's request, but the interaction turned sour after the friend made a snide remark. Hogg’s video of the dispute went viral. CBS later interviewed Hogg about the dispute and the video. From there, websites like the conspiracy-minded Infowars reached for straws, including Hogg’s appearance after the shooting on CBS This Morning. ""Interestingly, Hogg has reconnected with CBS for an appearance on CBS This Morning as the mainstream media unabashedly features high school students as figureheads for a new anti-gun push,"" InfoWars wrote in a blog. Folks on the internet took the claim one step further and claimed that the video was proof that Hogg was just pretending to be a high school student in a different state. At one point, the No. 1 trending video on YouTube was a video suggesting that Hogg was an actor, but the video has since been removed.  Hogg says he was visiting California, which is corroborated by his personal Twitter account.   ""I love going to LA for the summer,"" he tweeted August 5, 2017. I love going to LA for the summer pic.twitter.com/C2x5L3jbBB Shortly after, on Aug. 10, 2017, Hogg posted a short vlog (video blog) on YouTube about his experience in California. And finally, The Eagle Eye, Marjory Stoneman Douglas' newsmagazine, published a story about his vacation and viral video. Some social media users took the claim further and said that Hogg actually graduated from Redondo Shores High School in California. But evidence that supported those theories — like a supposed yearbook photo of Hogg in California — was debunked by fellow Stoneman Douglas High students on Twitter. One student, Sarah Chadwick, said that the images of Hogg allegedly pictured in a California yearbook were really from Stoneman High. ""She claims it’s not a Douglas yearbook (which I promise it is, I know multiple people in that picture) yet there’s someone in the pic wearing a douglas t-shirt????"" Chadwick tweeted. She claims it’s not a Douglas yearbook (which I promise it is, I know multiple people in that picture) yet there’s someone in the pic wearing a douglas t-shirt???? pic.twitter.com/BwPDyGztgK Another Stoneman Douglas High alumnus tweeted a video, which showed him flipping to Hogg’s photo in a Douglas yearbook. ""There’s a photo going around claiming David Hogg did not attend Douglas, but a school in California. Here’s a video to debunk that:"" tweeted Joey Wong. There’s a photo going around claiming David Hogg did not attend Douglas, but a school in California.

Those theories are unfounded. Conspiracy-minded websites are claiming Stoneman Douglas High students are crisis actors hired to stir up controversy. Not only is there no credible evidence to support this claim, plenty of evidence contradicts it entirely. The school district has confirmed that the targeted students are, in fact, students.

"['Georgia', 'Crime', 'Stacey Abrams']","
Are the majority of Georgians in jail because they can't pay bail?
","Stacey Abrams says Georgia must change its criminal justice system so that people are not kept in jail just because they can't pay for bail. People with money ""can artfully navigate the criminal justice system and maybe even avoid it altogether,"" but those who are poor are often overwhelmed by the system, said Abrams, a former Georgia House minority leader who’s running to become the state’s next governor. ""The majority of Georgians incarcerated in local jails have never been convicted of crime. They are simply too poor to pay their bail,"" Abrams said on her campaign website. Is that true? Recent state data indicates that about 64 percent of people in Georgia jails are awaiting trial. It’s unclear how many of them could not pay for bail, but experts said this is the case for many people nationwide and in other states. As of December 2017, there were 37,340 inmates in jail in Georgia, according to county jail inmate population report published by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs. And 64 percent of them were awaiting trial, the document said. (A more recent population report with inmate data as of Jan. 4 shows a slightly lower inmate count, but the share awaiting trial remains 64 percent.) That tracks with a February 2018 report from the Georgia Council on Criminal Justice Reform. It said also that as of early 2018, 64 percent of all jail inmates were awaiting trial. Abrams’ campaign also pointed to 2015 data published by Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit group trying to end mass incarceration. Its data showed that more than 50 percent of people in Georgia jails in 2015 were in pretrial. Still, those statistics don’t necessarily back up Abrams' point because of her word choice. Claiming that ""the majority of Georgians incarcerated in local jails have never been convicted of crime,"" is a broad claim that could be false depending on the interpretation of the word ""never,"" said William Sabol, a professor in criminal justice and criminology in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University. For instance, if by ""never"" she meant ""ever in one’s life,"" then that is likely to be an over-interpretation of the data in the report, Sabol said, because some individuals may have had prior convictions. The Georgia state report did not indicate how many people were jailed because they could not pay for bail. For this part of the claim, Abrams’ team referenced a national study. Several experts told us they did not have Georgia-specific data on individuals who could not afford bail, but did not dispute the likelihood of Georgia mirroring trends nationwide and from other states. ""Data on other states indicate that a majority of individuals in jails (as opposed to prisons) are present due to failure to make bail, and so are awaiting criminal trial prior to sentencing,"" said Arpit Gupta, an assistant professor of finance at NYU's Stern School of Business who has researched the bail system and its impact on low-income defendants. ""I don’t know about Georgia specifically, but it doesn’t surprise me that such a large percentage of incarcerated people — especially in local jails — are there awaiting trial because they can’t afford bail,"" said Nancy La Vigne, vice president for the Justice Policy Center at Urban Institute. Some states are eliminating the cash bail system, which is reducing their daily jail populations significantly, she said. A 2016 national report from Prison Policy Initiative said that most people who can’t meet bail ""fall within the poorest third of society."" ""Examining the median pre-incarceration incomes of people in jail makes it clear that the system of money bail is set up so that it fails: the ability to pay a bail bond is impossible for too many of the people expected to pay it,"" the report said. ""In fact, the typical black man, black woman and Hispanic woman detained for failure to pay a bail bond were living below the poverty line before incarceration."" Using Bureau of Justice Statistics data and in 2015 dollars, the report said, people in jail had a median annual income of $15,109 prior to their incarceration, or less than half (48 percent) of the median for people of similar ages who were not in jail. Still, financial constraints aren’t the only reasons why some individuals remain in jail before conviction, said Sabol, the Georgia State University professor. ""Some offenders are detained without bail or with bail set at very, very high amounts because they are perceived to be a danger to the community (preventive detention) or the seriousness of the crime was such that bail was denied,"" Sabol said. ""That is a different issue from an inability to pay bail."" In Georgia, bail may be denied under certain circumstances to individuals charged with felony offenses, but judges are legally prohibited from denying pretrial bail to individuals charged with a misdemeanor, said the report from the Georgia Council on Criminal Justice Reform. ""Consequently, the crucial question for misdemeanants in Georgia is not whether they will get bail, but the amount at which it will be set,"" the report said. The council spotlighted a case involving the city of Calhoun and Maurice Walker. In 2015, Walker was arrested in Calhoun for public intoxication and spent six days in jail because he could not afford to pay the $160 fixed bail amount. Walker sued the city, alleging its bail practice violated due process and equal protection clauses under the Fourteenth Amendment. In 2016, a court issued a preliminary injunction ordering Calhoun to implement post-arrest procedures complying with the Constitution, and told the city it could not keep individuals accused of misdemeanors in custody only because they could not afford a monetary bond, the report said. The case is under appeal. Abrams said, ""The majority of Georgians incarcerated in local jails have never been convicted of crime. They are simply too poor to pay their bail."" State data shows that the majority of people in county jails are awaiting trial. A criminal justice professor cautioned that claiming they ""have never been convicted of crime"" could be an overstatement, since some individuals may have had prior convictions. The state report did not indicate how many people were jailed because they could not afford bail. Yet experts told us that based on national trends, it’s possible that many Georgians in jail are there because they cannot pay for bail for current charges. With those caveats, we rate Abrams' statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD1B400>],/factchecks/2018/feb/21/stacey-abrams/majority-georgians-jail-locked-being-too-poor-pay-/

Florida Democatic Party says Gov. Scott ended a stream of mental health funding
","In the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., the Florida Democratic Party issued a list of grievances against Gov. Rick Scott for what it called a ""long record"" of opposing gun safety and money for mental health initiatives. Scott ""ended $20 million in funding for mental health care despite Florida already ranking at the bottom,"" the group said in a news release Feb. 19. Florida’s bottom-rung ranking for mental health funding came up a year earlier, after another Broward County shooting, this one at the Fort Lauderdale airport that killed five people. State Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, said Florida ranked 50th in the nation for mental health care funding, which we rated Mostly True. A year later, we wanted to see if anything had changed with Florida’s ranking on mental health spending and if Scott really ended $20 million in mental health funding. A key source of data for ranking states on mental health spending is the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute. According to the Institute, Florida ranked 51st in per capita spending in the fiscal year 2014. The institute collects annual data on expenditures by state mental health agencies from the states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. The total amount of expenditures is divided by the state population to compare the amount per capita. For Florida, the group tracked money spent through Florida’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Office, managed by the Department of Children and Families. So it doesn’t include services paid from other sources, including Medicaid or local funds, on mental health programs. Still, Florida has consistently been near the bottom of the rankings for years, Ted Lutterman, senior director of the institute previously told PolitiFact. We did not hear back from the institute to see if there was a more updated ranking, but mental health experts in the state said nothing had meaningfully changed. The biggest thing to know about the $20 million grant is it was never intended to be permanent. The $20.4 million was part of a federal block grant for substance abuse and mental health services. It was administered by the Florida Department of Children and Families and expired when the 2017-18 budget took effect. Again, Scott didn’t set the expiration date or cut if off early — he allowed the grant to expire. The Florida Democratic Party argues that it was Scott’s responsibility to fill the funding gap, and when he had the opportunity to fill it, he did not. ""It is the state’s job to manage the federal funds they receive and fill in gaps that may arise,"" said Florida Democratic Party spokeswoman Caroline Rowland. But Scott’s press office said it’s ""completely false"" to say that the grant’s expiration led to budget shortfalls. News reports, such as the Naples Daily News story included in the Florida Democratic Party’s news release, noted how mental health and substance abuse providers were struggling to provide their normal services ""after the Legislature and a state agency quietly allowed $20.4 million in federal money to expire without replacing it."" Even though the money was nonrecurring after the 2016-17 year, advocates said they were not expecting it to expire. ""No one was really aware that those funds were going away,"" said Linda McKinnon, Central Florida Behavioral Health Network president and CEO. McKinnon said the grant funds in questions were used for the ""full gamut"" of mental health treatments and substance abuse services. One area that took a hit when the grant expired, she said, was the availability of children’s crisis units across Central Florida’s network of providers. When word began to spread, several lawmakers called on Scott to do something about the issue. Former state Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, wrote a letter to Scott in August urging him to use his executive authority to fill the budget hole and extend Florida’s state of emergency over the opioid crisis. During a state of emergency, the governor can spend money appropriated for other purposes or spend unappropriated surplus funds, according to Florida statute. This way, Latvala argued, Scott could have used state reserves for the $20 million gap without the Legislature’s approval. Scott did not do this. Rep. Kathleen Peters, R-Pasadena, immediately called Scott about the funding shortfalls. But Scott pointed to a different $27 million grant that was included in the 2018-19 budget, according to a Tampa Bay Times column by John Romano. However, that grant was targetted to be spent on drugs such as methadone and Vivitrol, which are used to help wean addicts off opioids. The 2018-19 budget says it ""continues the state’s investment of more than $1 billion in funding"" for mental health and adds another $21.7 million to address other behavioral health needs. ""Gov. Scott’s executive order allowed the state to immediately draw down $27 million in federal funds, and he has proposed significant investments for mental health and the fight against opioids in his 2018-2019 recommended budget,"" said Scott’s spokeswoman Kerri Wyland. Regardless of other grants and the new budget, Candice Crawford, the CEO of the Mental Health Association of Central Florida, described Scott’s proposed amount of funding for mental health as short of where it needs to be. ""The governor has never really recommended a substantial amount of funding for mental health,"" Crawford said. We wondered how the grant money might be related to the situation of Nikolas Cruz, who authorities say admitted to shooting the students at the school he once attended. Not long before the shooting, DCF investigated Cruz after he posted ""violent"" social media posts, according to records obtained by the New York Times. The report mentioned that Cruz had been visited by a counselor from Henderson Behavioral Health, which provides mental health services in South Florida.   Mental health advocates said it is fair to assume that a portion of the grant money would have gone to services that might have helped Cruz. The Florida Democratic Party said that Scott ""ended $20 million in funding for mental health care despite Florida already ranking at the bottom."" There’s little doubt that Florida ranks near the bottom when it comes to mental health funding, but the first half of the Florida Democratic Party’s claim needs context. A nonrecurring funding stream for substance abuse and mental health block grants did end under Scott’s watch. Scott could have used his executive authority to fill the gap, but chose not to do so. In other words, Scott did not end the grant, he just didn’t do anything to fill the gap in funding despite having the opportunity to do so. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACA1640>],/factchecks/2018/feb/21/florida-democratic-party/florida-democatic-party-says-gov-scott-ended-strea/
"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Donald Trump']","
Has Donald Trump 'been much tougher on Russia' than Barack Obama?
","Amid swelling evidence of Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, President Donald Trump pushed back against critics who say he's given the Kremlin a free pass. In one tweet on Feb. 20, Trump said, ""I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News!"" I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News! The tweet immediately drew guffaws among media commentators and on social media, who quickly plucked examples of Trump downplaying evidence of a far-reaching effort by Russia to meddle in the election. (Just a day earlier, we gave Trump a Pants on Fire for tweeting that he ""never said Russia did not meddle in the election."") When we looked at the past decade of U.S.-Russia policy, however, we found a more nuanced picture. Tougher government policies implemented under President Barack Obama have largely continued under Trump, even though they were often overshadowed — and perhaps undercut — by Trump’s friendly remarks and tweets toward Russia and President Vladimir Putin. The consensus among experts is that Obama was more forceful than Trump has been to date on countering election meddling. ""The key difference from Obama was (Trump’s) unwillingness to take the meddling issue head on,"" said Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. As we’ve noted in previous fact-checks, the Obama administration took actions before and after Election Day. Prior to the election, the Obama administration publicly named the Russian government as the culprit, confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin in person, and worked to secure U.S. election infrastructure — all while intelligence agencies investigated the issue. But the Obama administration’s most significant retaliatory measure against Russia came after Trump’s electoral win. On Dec. 29, 2016, Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats and suspected intelligence agents to leave the United States, and he also imposed narrow sanctions on some Russian individuals and organizations. Trump, on the other hand, has cast doubt on Russia’s election meddling and repeated Putin’s denials of his government’s involvement.  ""The Trump administration has repeatedly tried to undermine the credibility of the FBI and intelligence agencies in their investigation and assessment of the threat to the integrity of U.S. elections by Russian operatives,"" said Yoshiko Herrera, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Herrera added that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is looking into whether the Trump administration crossed the line into obstruction of justice by trying to impede the investigation of the Russian threat to the American electoral system. While some experts noted that Trump signed a law calling for new sanctions against Russia in response to its interference with the election, they added that the legislation was hardly the product of Trump’s hardline advocacy. Congress largely passed the bill — with veto-proof majorities — in response to Trump’s downplaying of the meddling question and his seeming interest in lifting sanctions against Russia, Sestanovich said. When it came time to sign the bill into law in August, Trump did so grudgingly. He expressed significant reservations, saying it was ""seriously flawed"" because it usurped the executive branch’s negotiating authority. Matthew Kroenig, an associate professor in the Department of Government and School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, said Trump had a point with his reservations about the legislative package, noting that the Obama administration made similar arguments that congressional sanctions against Iran infringed on the executive's authority to set foreign policy. Several experts said the White House has been hesitant to implement the sanctions. Sestanovich characterized its implementation as ""slow and half-hearted."" In late January, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers the administration would apply sanctions to a new list of Russian oligarchs and senior government officials. ""The Trump administration didn’t provide the list of who they apply to until very late,"" Herrera said. ""That’s a clear sign of foot-dragging by the White House."" Susanne Wengle, a political science professor at the University of Notre Dame, agreed that Trump ""has not been proactive or voiced strong opposition to Russian involvement in U.S. politics,"" while Obama did. However, she noted that the Trump administration has not gone so far as to reverse Obama-era laws and regulations, including the Magnitsky Act, which targeted high-ranking Russians with sanctions. Russian President Vladimir Putin listens to President Barack Obama in Hangzhou, China on Sept. 5, 2016. (Alexei Druzhinin/Sputnik, Kremlin Pool via AP) The White House provided some examples of policies broader than the reaction to election meddling. Judging the tweet based on the administration's geopolitical policies makes the analysis a bit more complicated. There’s a crucial dividing line for U.S. policy toward Russia — early 2014, when Russia annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Before that, the United States sought common ground with Russia. After that, Russia was seen in a more adversarial way. During the early years of Obama’s presidency, and especially during the Russian presidential interregnum of Dmitry Medvedev, the United States sought a ""reset"" with Russia and managed to hammer out several accomplishments, including a nuclear-arms deal. ""Obama's first national security strategy only mentioned Russia as a potential partner, never as a possible threat,"" Kroenig said. ""He promised in the famous ‘hot mic’ episode that he would have ‘flexibility’ to make concessions on missile defense after the (2012) election. He refused to intervene in Syria in part because his team feared direct conflict with Russia. He refused to provide lethal aid to Ukraine fearing escalation with Russia. And he did not develop a serious strategy to deter the threat of Russian nuclear ‘de-escalation’ strikes."" However, an increase in conflict between the two countries, heightened by the return of Putin to the presidency in 2012, prompted skepticism about whether a genuine reset was feasible. Ultimately, the reset died out entirely after the Crimean annexation in 2014. In a very narrow sense, Trump has a case. ""If you compare current 2018 U.S. policy to U.S. policy during Obama’s first term, then the U.S. is clearly ‘tougher’ on Russia now,"" said Dan Nexon, an associate professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University. After 2014, however, Obama’s Russia policy stiffened considerably. These included a rapid set of sanctions on people and enterprises in March 2014 following the Crimean annexation, and sector-based sanctions on Russia in July 2014 following continued Russian military activities in eastern Ukraine, said Anders Åslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Later, Obama’s actions included the expulsion of Russian diplomats in December 2016, the closing of Russian compounds, and a variety of statements critical of Russia and Putin. Trump’s rhetoric has consistently indicated warmth and trust toward Russia and Putin, and Trump has also sent mixed signals about the U.S. commitment to NATO. On the other hand, post-2014 U.S. policy aimed at Russia has chugged forward in important ways since Trump became president — despite his rhetoric. ""The rest of the executive branch and Congress have actually taken a few tough stands against Russia during the last year,"" said Susan H. Allen, director of the Center for Peacemaking Practice at George Mason University’s School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution. Among them, Kroening said, are a boost in funding for the European Reassurance Initiative, a security program that began under Obama; the development of new, low-yield nuclear capabilities to deter Russian nuclear attack; upgrades for missile defenses; and an approval of Montenegro’s bid to join NATO, which had been in the works for years. The Trump administration also slapped new sanctions on five Russians and Chechens over human rights abuses. Trump’s two highest-profile acts challenging Russia were his cruise missile attack against Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, a Russian ally, and his approval of lethal arms sales to Ukraine. In both of those cases, Trump went further than Obama did, though it remains to be seen how thoroughly the administration will follow through on both developments. To the extent that Trump’s policies against Russia have met or exceeded Obama’s post-2014 policies, the credit goes more to his agencies and Congress, experts said. These policies are ones that ""hawkish military types in his orbit like, and were not likely from his own initiative,"" said Wengle, the University of Notre Dame professor. Trump said, ""I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News!"" There’s broad agreement that on election meddling, Obama’s actions — while arguably insufficient to the threat at hand — were stronger than Trump’s. On a broader geopolitical level, there has been a significant degree of consistency between the Obama and Trump administrations in actual U.S. policy, and even a few examples where Trump has gone further than Obama did. That said, Trump’s own record of Russia- and Putin-friendly comments have sent contrary messages about U.S. policy toward Russia. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly False.

"['Elections', 'PunditFact', 'Dick Morris']","
Dick Morris: There's proof that over 1 million people voted twice in 2012
","The pursuit of voter fraud is a running theme among Republicans and the latest numbers out of North Carolina made the conservative websites pop with alarming headlines. ""Oh My: Audit Finds Evidence of Widespread Voter Fraud in North Carolina,"" wrote Townhall.com. The National Review had ""N.C. State Board Finds More than 35K Incidents of ‘Double Voting’ in 2012."" The North Carolina news certainly fired up Dick Morris, a Fox News commentator and former political adviser to President Bill Clinton (who has largely turned against the Clintons these days). ""It's most important data I've read in a year,"" Morris said on Fox News’ Hannity. ""The elections commissioner there, Kim Strach, did a study of those who voted in North Carolina who also voted in another state in 2012 and she found 35,500 people voted in North Carolina and voted in some other state. ""And only 27 states pool that data. Texas, California, New York and Florida did not pool their data. So you're talking about probably over a million people that voted twice in this election. This is the first concrete evidence we've ever had of massive voter fraud. We’ve talked about it ad nauseam. This proves it."" Morris amplified on this claim in an op-ed that came out two days later. For this fact-check, we examine whether the report from the North Carolina Board of Elections proves that probably a million people voted twice in 2012. Let’s begin with the report, which wasn’t so much a report as one small piece of a longer slide show for lawmakers sitting on the state’s Elections Oversight Committee (see slides 34 and 35 in the presentation). Strach, executive director of the State Board of Elections, was giving the initial results from the state’s participation in a project run by the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office, Interstate Crosscheck. That project has grown from four states in 2005 to 28 in 2013. The list includes Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia, Georgia,  North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Those states send voter information to Kansas where the record of each of their voters is run against the records in all the other participating states. They are matched on first name, last name, date of birth and Social Security number. According to the Associated Press, Strach reported that this produced 765 voters in North Carolina who matched on each category with someone who voted elsewhere during the 2012 general election. ""Could it be voter fraud? Sure, it could be voter fraud,"" Strach told lawmakers. ""Could it be an error on the part of a precinct person choosing the wrong person's name in the first place? It could be. We're looking at each of these individual cases."" Stracht said an additional 35,570 North Carolina voters matched on first and last name and date of birth, but not Social Security number. She emphasized the need for more investigation. Hans von Spakovsky, a former member of the Federal Election Commission who is a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that 765 voters matched down to the last four digits of a Social Security number suggests that North Carolina has the goods. ""It is highly unlikely with all of these matching, that these were different individuals,"" Spakovsky said. Spakovsky said the larger group, based on name and birth date, was also fruitful ground to root out abuse. ""It is probable that many of these are the same individuals, but there is also going to be certain percentage of folks who may share the same name and birthdate but are not the same individual. What that proportion will be I don’t know – but they all need to be investigated,"" he said. These numbers are large. In fact, Spakovsky said that in itself is part of the problem. It takes an enormous effort to get to the bottom of each case and election officials rarely have the resources. However, if the past is any guide, there is reason to doubt that the problem of double voting and voting fraud is as large as these figures suggest. The track record of the Interstate Crosscheck program itself shows how quickly the scale can drop from massive to miniscule. Kansas created the project nearly a decade ago, which is enough time to assess its performance. In a September 2013 presentation, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach said more than 84 million records had been fed into his office’s database. At that time, 22 states were in the pool. Kansas found over 120,000 potential duplicate voters based on first and last name and date of birth. The emphasis is on potential. Kobach’s presentation included the number of cases referred for prosecution. The total was 14. All of the referrals dated back to at least 2010. That year, over 850,000 people voted. There is no indication that any convictions emerged. That might be due to the workload and priorities of prosecutors but the point remains the same: The Interstate Crosscheck process starts very big and ends very small. Kobach also noted that four people were indicted in Colorado on charges of having also voted in Arizona. While an indictment is more serious than a referral, again, it is not a conviction. We reached out to the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office but the staff did not respond before our deadline. We will update this article if we learn anything new. The question is, why do the numbers drop off so radically? Michael McDonald, a political scientist at George Mason University, says there are many reasons. In his research, McDonald has spent a lot of time with voting records. They are not tidy. ""You find missing data, or worse, a missing data code,"" McDonald explained. ""They might plug in ‘9999’ when they don’t have a Social Security number and people are getting matched on that missing data code."" In particular, clerical errors make voting records highly unreliable, McDonald said. ""Someone might mark that a person voted when they didn’t, or they confuse fathers and sons who have the same name,"" he said. Interestingly, the Interstate Crosscheck staff acknowledge this. In their 2014 participation guide for states, they warn that ""a significant number of apparent double votes are false positives and not double votes. Many are the result of errors -- voters sign the wrong line in the poll book, election clerks scan the wrong line with a barcode scanner."" PunditFact looked at how North Carolina keeps its records. A bit over half of the counties, 53 of them, use a manual entry paper poll book. Mistakes are simply part of record keeping. In a different arena, medical records, one review found that at least 23 percent of names were misspelled. If database systems and human error aren’t enough to explain the huge number of matches, basic statistics make it even tougher to say this process picks out the same person in two states. McDonald co-authored a 2007 article that ran the numbers on New Jersey’s 2004 voter registry. More than 3.5 million people were listed as having voted that year. There was an allegation that over 4,000 people had voted twice. After scrubbing the list of 4,000 for clerical errors, about 800 matches remained. But statistically, researchers calculated that you would expect about 400 people out of the original 3.5 million to have the same names and birth dates. ""The bigger the number of people, the more likely you will find these sorts of matches,"" McDonald said. ""But they aren’t the same person."" The latest round of the Interstate Crosscheck involved over 100 million records. Outside of the Interstate Crosscheck system, the number of people who vote twice seems low. PolitiFact Texas found that of 616 allegations of voting violations over 10 years in Texas, one conviction emerged for double-voting. So we know it’s unlikely that 35,000-or-more North Carolinians voted twice in 2012. How did Morris stretch it all the way to 1 million? In his op-ed, he offers some basic, but incorrect, math. The population of North Carolina is around 9.7 million, or about 3 percent of the overall U.S. population. If 35,000-or-more people voted twice in North Carolina, and if that trend continued all over the country, that would mean about 1.1 million people will have voted twice across the country, Morris figures. The problem with that calculation, however, is that if the same person votes once in North Carolina and once in Kansas, they will appear as having wrongly voted in both Kansas and North Carolina (2 hits in Morris’ calculation) -- but it would actually only be one offense. Morris seems to recognize this mistake. In his op-ed, he shifted to talking about ""double-votes"". So not only is the point Morris made on television flawed, his math appears to be inflated by 100 percent. Our ruling Morris said that the large number of North Carolina voters matched with records in other states was proof that over 1 million people voted twice in the 2012 election. While Morris admittedly was extrapolating from the North Carolina data, his conclusion is flawed on several fronts. The head of North Carolina’s board of elections did not claim that even the closest matches on name, birth date and Social Security numbers was conclusive evidence. She said more investigation was needed. The track record of the Interstate Crosscheck project shows that a tiny fraction of all potential matches represents any kind of voting fraud. In Kansas, out of more than 850,000 votes cast, only 14 names were recommended for prosecution and the Kansas Secretary of State reported no convictions. In other states, database quirks, human error and the statistics of large numbers have been shown to trim the initial reports of widespread fraud down to the barest sliver of actual cases. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD03140>],/factchecks/2014/apr/10/dick-morris/dick-morris-theres-proof-over-1-million-people-vot/

How rare is it that we had three presidents re-elected consecutively? Very rare
","On Thursday’s Morning Joe, host Joe Scarborough dropped a bit of presidential trivia that we hadn’t heard before. During a discussion about the inability of recent American presidents to accomplish major political achievements, Scarborough said that before ""our last three presidents, you have to go back to the 1800s, early 1800s, to find three presidents in a row being consecutively re-elected.""

Very rare, it turns out. In fact, it’s only happened once before -- from 1800-24, when Thomas Jefferson, James Madision and James Monroe were each elected to consecutive terms. (They were the third, fourth and fifth presidents.) We’ve only come close one other time, but deaths and resignations interrupted that: • President Harry Truman served more than seven years in office, having finished President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s fourth term and having been elected on his own once, in 1948 (1945-52). • President Dwight Eisenhower served two full terms (1953-60). • President John F. Kennedy was assassinated during his first term. President Lyndon B. Johnson completed Kennedy’s term and was elected to his own four-year term in 1964 (1961-68). • President Richard Nixon was elected president in 1968 and re-elected in 1972 before resigning in 1974 (1969-74). Our ruling Scarborough said that before ""our last three presidents, you have to go back to the 1800s, early 1800s to find three presidents in a row being consecutively re-elected."" He’s right.

""I mean, in a lot of ways, I think the country is in deep trouble. And it’s not just a bad economy or the huge amount of debt. You have, I think, kind of social ills that have been encouraged by bad federal policies. And I’m thinking about the out-of-control entitlements that have led to a complete breakdown of the family and so many segments of society. ""The Republicans, I don’t think, are doing enough to articulate the size of the problem,"" Grothman continued, before uttering the claim we decided to check. ""And when the Republicans were last in control – from like 2001 to 2007, when they had the president, the House and the Senate – they really only made matters worse. During that time, the number of people on food stamps, the number of people in low-income housing went through the roof."" So, let’s see if there was huge growth in food stamps and low-income housing during the period Grothman cites and, if so, whether the GOP was responsible. Party control  As Grothman indicated, Republicans were mostly in control in Washington from 2001 to 2007, with George W. Bush in the White House and GOP majorities in the House. But in the Senate, Democrats held a 51-49 majority for about a year and a half during that period. The power shift occurred in June 2001 after Vermont Sen. James Jeffords left the GOP, became an independent and caucused with the Democrats. The 51-49 edge went back to the GOP in mid-November 2002 when Republican James Talent won a Senate seat in Missouri. Republicans maintained control through the 2005-’07 congressional session (Democrats retook the Senate in the 2007-’09 Congress.) Now to the two parts of Grothman’s claim. Food stamps  U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show the average number of food stamp recipients increased in each year between 2001 and 2006, before edging downward in 2007. 2001: 17.3 million 2002: 19.1 million 2003: 21.3 million 2004: 23.8 million 2005: 25.6 million 2006: 26.5 million 2007: 26.3 million The number of people on food stamps was 52 percent higher in 2007 than it was in 2001. And that came after a six-year span, from 1995 to 2001, when the number of food stamp recipients declined by 35 percent. Changes in policy were important in the increase during the 2001-’07 period Grothman cited. In rating as True a claim that food stamp spending doubled under Bush and doubled again under President Barack Obama, PolitiFact National found that lawmakers in 2002 had rolled back some food stamp eligibility restrictions. And a Bush adviser told our colleagues the administration’s goal at the time was to expand food programs for low-income working families and make it easier for states to administer the program and get more eligible people signed up. Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute and Stacy Dean of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities told us the economy and Bush policies were factors. Tanner put more weight on the policies, while Dean cited both factors. So, there’s evidence to back the first part of Grothman’s claim. Low-income housing When we asked for evidence on the second part of the claim, Grothman admitted he didn’t have figures on the number of people living in low-income housing, but assumed the number had increased because more tax credits were made available to developers of low-income housing units. More specifically, Congress in 2001 increased by 40 percent -- from $1.25 to $1.75 per person -- and indexed to inflation a tax credit that states could allocate towards funding low-income housing. But Grothman’s statement was much broader than one specific program. He said that the number of people living in low-income housing -- not just those benefitting from one particular program -- was way up. So that’s how we’re evaluating that part of his claim. Figures from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development count the number of people living in all types of HUD-subsidized housing, including those in units built with low-income tax credits as well as in units covered by the rent-subsidy Section 8 program and other programs. The number rose from 8.49 million in 2000 to 9.39 million in 2007. The 2007 figure is 10.6 percent higher. That’s not a staggering increase, but it certainly is a significant one. Barbara Sard, vice president for housing policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said much of the increase was due to an increase in subsidized-housing vouchers authorized by Congress from 1999 to 2001 (when the GOP controlled both chambers and Democrat Bill Clinton was president).   The Cato Institute’s Mark Calabria, a staff member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs during about half the period Grothman cited, noted the tax credit expansion that Grothman cited. He also said the Bush administration added more housing vouchers and congressional Republicans didn’t move to curtail spending on housing assistance. Our rating Grothman said that when Republicans last controlled the presidency and Congress, from roughly 2001 to 2007, ""the number of people on food stamps (and) the number of people in low-income housing went through the roof."" After having declined for a number of years, the number of people receiving food stamps increased 52 percent during the period, as the Bush administration and Congress widened eligibility and encouraged more eligible people to apply. The increase in people living in low-income housing was more modest, but still significant. We rate Grothman’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB22600>],/factchecks/2014/apr/10/glenn-grothman/when-gop-last-ran-washington-rolls-food-stamps-sub/

What pay gap? Young women out-earn men in cities, conservative pundit claims
","Why is it that women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns? You likely heard the statistic, which was slapped all over the cable news networks Tuesday to mark ""Equal Pay Day."" To many Democrats, it symbolizes an unfairness in the pay structures of jobs all across America. But conservatives say the situation is more complex, and as much about life choices as some fundamental inequality. We watched the debate play out between conservative pundit Sabrina Schaeffer and liberal pundit Elizabeth Plank on MSNBC’s The Reid Report, and again later between former White House adviser Anita Dunn and conservative pundit Genevieve Wood on CNN’s The Lead with Jake Tapper. ""If you compare women to men in the same job with similar background, similar experiences that they bring to the table, the wage gap all but disappears,"" Wood said. ""Women have made great strides. Instead of celebrating that, this is a political year, the White House wants to portray this war on women."" ""Not only are the numbers wrong -- young women today in metropolitan areas, for example, are actually outperforming males in that same category all over the country."" Dunn pushed back. ""I'm going to jump in a little on that because I think that it's true that women are making enormous progress, but you know, as well as I do, that as they get older in the workforce, that those disparities start to grow and there are all kinds of reasons that that happens and an important discussion across the board is how do we continue to make sure that the progress continues,"" she said. PolitiFact has given you the nuts and bolts about the 77 cents statistic -- you can read the two most important works in this area here and here. Basically, there is a wage gap, but it tends to disappear when you compare women and men in the exact same jobs who have the same levels of experience and education. We at PunditFact want to look at the argument being offered by conservatives. In this case, we are checking Wood -- a conservative pundit with the Heritage Foundation -- who said,  ""Young women today in metropolitan areas, for example, who are childless, single young women are actually outperforming males in that same category all over the country."" Basis of the claim Wood directed us to a 2012 U.S. News and World Report article that was reposted on the website of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The article includes the following line: ""Census data from 2008 show that single, childless women in their 20s now earn 8 percent more on average than their male counterparts in metropolitan areas."" That matches up to what Wood said on CNN. Drilling down further, the reference comes more directly from an analysis of Census Bureau data performed by James Chung of Reach Advisors. Reach Advisors is a private research firm based in New York. Chung spent about a year analyzing 2008 data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, looking at the earnings of men and women in metropolitan areas. The actual study was never released, just some of the findings, Chung told PunditFact this week. Among what was released in September 2010 was this: The median full-time salaries of young women in America’s metropolitan areas are 8 percent higher than those of the guys in their peer group. A breakdown provided for Time magazine included a look at specific cities. In Atlanta, young unmarried childless women made 21 percent more than men, Chung found. In Los Angeles, young women made 12 percent more than their cohorts. The news also was reported by NPR and CBS News. The American Enterprise Institute converted specific numbers into this graphic to show how women are out-earning men in some cases: 
 Chung said he has not updated his analysis to how the figures have changed since 2008 and ""no longer circulate (the analysis) as current since it's now four years out of date."" No one else, that we’re aware of, has attempted to recreate Chung’s specific analysis, and we found no criticism of Chung’s methodology. We did come across an analysis by Pew Research, which looked earnings trends for all women between 25 and 34 (a broader and older group). Compared to all men of the same age, Pew Research found women earn 93 percent of what a man earns. That's a smaller gap than when considering all women and all men, Pew found. Analyzing Wood’s statement We sent Wood’s statement to Chung and asked for his take. While Wood is careful to note that she was talking about ""childless, single young women"" in metropolitan areas, Chung said that Wood failed to note that the analysis concerned median incomes between men and women. Why is that important? Median income figures look at earnings in the aggregate, rather than compare like jobs or professions. That leaves the claim open to the same criticism Republicans levy against Democrats when they claim women earn 77 cents for every $1 a man does. (Namely, that the statistic isn’t a true apple-to-apples comparison.) In the case of Chung’s findings, the reason why young women in metropolitan areas earn more than young men is that they are 50 percent more likely to graduate from college. ""As a result, they populate more of the entry-level knowledge-based economy jobs than young men,"" Chung said. Chung said it ""would be totally incorrect to imply that these women outearn men with similar jobs or similar educations.""      ""The bottom line is that in a world where most players are looking for a sound bite to support a specific position, this is actually a rather complex issue,"" Chung said. ""Things aren't exactly as equal as some people say, but it's not always as dire as others say."" Our ruling Wood said, ""Young women today in metropolitan areas, for example, who are childless, single young women are actually outperforming males in that same category all over the country."" The statement tracks back to a credible analysis of 2008 Census Bureau data that looks at median incomes in metropolitan areas -- a fact that Wood ignores. But she gets most of the other details correct, and while the information is now six years old, we were unable to track down more recent research to confirm or disprove the point. Finally, we should note that this comparison holds true because childless, single young women tend to have more education and qualify for higher paying jobs. Wood’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBCA4300>],/factchecks/2014/apr/09/genevieve-wood/what-pay-gap-young-women-out-earn-men-cities-gop-p/

Fox News' Eric Bolling says 61 percent of new jobs under Obama have gone to men
","As the White House and its Democratic allies were spending a day decrying a persistent wage gap between men and women, critics of President Barack Obama worked just as aggressively to poke holes in the Democratic narrative. On the April 8, 2014, Fox News’ The Five, panelist Eric Bolling offered several statistics that suggested that Democrats were themselves retrograde on gender equity. Bolling began by repeating a claim that women in the White House are paid 88 cents for every dollar earned by men. Then he said that, as a senator in 2008, Obama paid his female staffers 70 cents for every dollar his male staffers earned. Then Bolling offered a claim that really raised our eyebrows. ""Of all the jobs President Obama claims to have created since he started, only 38.5 percent are women,"" Bolling said. ""So 61.5 percent have gone to men."" Is that correct? To find out, we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal office that calculates employment data. We looked at the gender breakdowns for the increase in employed Americans between January 2009, when Obama took office, and March 2014, the most recent month for which data is available. By the numbers, Bolling was on the mark. During that period, the number of men holding jobs increased by a little more than 2.2 million, while the number of women holding jobs rose by a bit less than 1.4 million. So 61 percent of the increase in employment during that period was accounted for by men -- just as Bolling said. Just to be safe, we also checked the period between July 2009 -- the official end of the last recession -- and March 2014. We found that the men’s share of added jobs was even higher for this period, at 65 percent. We also confirmed that this proportion of men isn’t just simply a reflection of the overall gender makeup of employment in the United States. Over the period we were looking at, the universe of employed Americans has broken down pretty consistently -- 53 percent men, 47 percent women. So for 61 percent of job gains to go to men is a disproportionate share. This may be an embarrassment for the administration -- that’s a matter of opinion. On the other hand, there is an explanation for the male-centric nature of job creation during the recovery, and it doesn’t have much, if anything, to do with Obama. Put simply, the recession was a ""man-cession"" -- meaning that men were hit disproportionately. And given that, it’s not surprising at all that the recovery has been something of a ""man-covery."" Let’s take a closer look at the data. During the recession -- from December 2007 to July 2009 -- the number of men working fell by almost 4.7 million, but the number of women working fell by a much smaller amount, about 1.7 million. In other words, during the recession, 74 percent of the job losses came from jobs held by men. And the fact that men are now getting 61 percent of the newly created jobs means they’re actually not even regaining jobs at a rate high enough to wipe out the losses they suffered during the recession. ""The first 12 or 13 months of the recession -- the pre-Obama recession -- were terribly hard on men, because it was hard on the industries in which men hold a disproportionate share of the jobs, especially construction and durable manufacturing,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""After President Obama took office, the recession spread to many more industries -- industries in which women held a higher proportion of the jobs."" Then, Burtless continued, when the recovery began, employment tended to increase in industries that were ""severely affected in the early, pre-Obama recession, the industries where men were more likely to hold most of the jobs -- durable manufacturing at first, then construction."" Meanwhile, there’s one sector of the economy that has seen steep declines since the last recession -- government, which has shed 738,000 jobs since January 2009. The government workforce, notably, is disproportionately female. Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic Policy Research, added that there’s historical precedent for this kind of male-dominated recovery. ""In the year from December 1982 to December 1983, employment of men increased by 2.26 million while employment of women increased by just 1.7 million,"" Baker said. ""And this was a period when there were still large numbers of women entering the workforce for the first time."" Our ruling Bolling said that, ""of all the jobs president Obama claims to have created since he started, only 38.5 percent are women. So 61.5 percent have gone to men."" Bolling is right on the numbers, but as a shot against Obama, the claim rings somewhat hollow. The male tilt to job gains during Obama’s presidency follows a strong pattern of male job losses in the months of the recession before Obama took office. So the gender balance of job creation has more to do with cyclical economic factors than anything the administration did or didn’t do. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. So we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB958240>],/factchecks/2014/apr/09/eric-bolling/fox-news-eric-bolling-says-61-percent-new-jobs-und/

Democratic PAC says Tom Cotton 'got paid handsomely working for insurance companies'
","This election cycle, we’ve seen vulnerable Senate Democrats attacked by the billionaire Koch brothers in costly TV ad spots. It’s safe to say, though, that Democrats are fighting back. Take the Senate Majority PAC, an outside group formed in 2011 to support Democratic Senate candidates. They launched a statewide ad in Arkansas attacking Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who’s up against Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor come November. ""Corporate special interests are spending millions to smear Mark Pryor and elect Tom Cotton,"" the narrator said. ""Why? Before Congress, Cotton got paid handsomely working for insurance companies and corporate interests."" PolitiFact wanted to know if Cotton really worked for insurance companies before taking office in 2013. Cotton’s campaign didn’t respond to our requests for comment. What most people know about Cotton’s work experience is the years he spent serving in Afghanistan and Iraq from 2005 to 2009. That experience has come under fire from Pryor, who accused his opponent of having a ""sense of entitlement"" about his decorated military past. Shortly after Cotton’s honorable discharge from the military, he worked at a global consulting firm called McKinsey & Company. The firm employs 17,000 people across 60 countries. Democrats like Chelsea Clinton and Susan Rice have also worked there. The Senate Majority PAC pointed us to Cotton’s Facebook biography, which says, ""As a businessman, Tom has advised some of America’s most respected companies on business strategy, operations, finance, and marketing. His industry experience includes agribusiness, health care, oil and gas, food processing, insurance, and aerospace."" That’s not work directly for an insurance company. And Glenn Kessler, our Washington Post fact-checking colleague, noted that Cotton has never even worked for an insurance company in a consulting role. Cotton worked on an assignment with the Federal Housing Authority to improve insurance offered to lenders who finance apartment buildings in the government’s multifamily housing programs, according to a statement from his former boss. So Cotton didn’t work for an insurance company. But did he get paid handsomely? That’s a subjective judgment we won’t weigh in on. But we can see from his financial disclosure statement that Cotton earned $85,000 from McKinsey in 2011. For comparison, he makes $174,000 per year in Congress. Our ruling The Senate Majority PAC ad claimed, ""Before Congress, Cotton got paid handsomely working for insurance companies and corporate interests."" Cotton’s never worked for an insurance company, nor has he served as a consultant for one.

Bob Beckel: Koch brothers are one of the biggest polluters in the country
","When a billionaire speaks, people listen, especially when that billionaire is Charles Koch. Koch, along with his brother David, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to get the low-tax, low-regulation government he wants. He’s backed the tea party-funded campaign ads to topple Democrats and deployed scores of lobbyists. Koch’s spirited defense in the Wall Street Journal of himself and Koch Industries was everything the talking heads on Fox News’ The Five could have asked for. The resident Democrat, Bob Beckel, set out to skewer the Koch brothers. The rest of the panel, like Greg Gutfeld and Kimberly Guilfoyle, praised them for their philanthropy and business success. Beckel was unimpressed. Beckel: ""The Koch brothers are one of the biggest polluters in the country."" Gutfeld: ""They pollute us with money."" (While this could be taken differently, this was praise.) Beckel: ""They pollute this country."" Guilfoyle: ""You don’t have any evidence to substantiate that."" Beckel: ""Yes, I do."" We tried to reach Beckel to hear about his evidence, but we got no response. What we found in its place was a report from the left-leaning Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. Last year, the institute released two lists of the 100 firms with the most significant emissions in the nation. One list is for air and the other is for water. On the first, Koch Industries ranked 14th. On the second, it ranked 30th. Some of the companies ranking high on both lists include ExxonMobil, BASF, Bayer Group and Dow Chemical. Behind these rankings is data reported by companies to the Environmental Protection Agency and compiled in something called the Toxics Release Inventory. The Toxics Release Inventory provides the numbers of pounds of waste chemicals released into the environment by each facility. Every facility operates under a permit from the EPA. The EPA then takes this release information and runs it through a computer model that factors in the toxicity of the chemicals, how they get moved around and how close they are to population centers. What emerges is a score. (The technical name is the Risk Screening Environmental Indicator.) This score is a measure of risk. It doesn’t mean that a facility actually poses a threat to health, but a score that is 10 times higher than another means the ""the potential for risk is 10 times higher,"" according to the EPA. This method has been around since 1991 and been reviewed and refined several times since then. It’s important to remember that this information is just for each particular plant. What the researchers at Amherst do is tie each plant to its corporate owner and come up with a total score for a company. ""The match of facilities to the companies that own them is a substantial effort for us,"" said Michael Ash, chair of the economics department at UMass-Amherst and head of the project. To repeat, it’s by this measure that Koch Industries ranks 14th in the country in terms of companies sending emissions into the air and 30th in sending emissions into the water. The top air polluter, according to the analysis, is Precision Castparts. The top water polluter is Ohio Valley Electric. We wanted to know if there is anything analytically wrong with adding up the scores the way Ash's group does. We found that the business magazine Forbes has reported these results without challenging them. An environmental economist, Nicolaas Bouwes, who helped develop the Risk Screening Environmental Indicator at the EPA, told PunditFact that there is ""no problem aggregating the numbers."" ""The point of the model was to identify problem actors,"" Bouwes said. ""If you are at #14, there are issues to look into."" Koch Industries did not dispute the findings. ""Koch’s TRI (Toxic Release Inventory) number is what it is because we have a large number of U.S. manufacturing sites and we're a U.S.-based company,"" said spokesman Rob Tappan. Tappan is correct that Koch Industries has a large number of plants. It operates over 100 facilities that produce everything from plywood, to asphalt, to jet fuel. One of its companies makes Brawny paper towels. That water you bought at the store might come in a bottle made of plastic from a Koch Industries plant. The company runs nearly twice as many sites as the corporation with the next-largest number of plants, Honeywell, which has about 60. You would expect that releases would go up with each additional facility. On the other hand, when we dipped into the EPA’s data (using the database on the Right To Know Network), we found that on average, each Koch plant generated about five times as much as each Honeywell plant. Roughly speaking, the comparison was about 500,000 pounds of chemical releases compared to about 100,000. So the number of plants alone doesn’t explain the Koch brothers’ high numbers. Tappan underscored that the Political Economy Research Institute (the University of Massachusetts-Amherst group) has ""radical"" roots. Ash, he noted is a member of the Union for Radical Political Economics. That organization's website proclaims that it ""presents a continuing critique of the capitalist system and all forms of exploitation and oppression while helping to construct a progressive social policy and create socialist alternatives."" While that perspective is not mainstream, that by itself does not invalidate the institute’s findings. Tappan also notes that ""our manufacturing emissions meet all EPA standards, and we work hard to exceed them."" However, Koch Industries paid a $30 million civil fine in January 2000 for its role in more than 300 spills from oil pipelines and facilities in six states. At the time, the fine was the largest civil fine levied under any environmental law, according to the EPA. And last month, leaks at a Texas chemical plant cost the company a $350,000 fine with the promise to invest $45 million in equipment upgrades. Our ruling Beckel said that the Koch brothers are one of the country’s biggest polluters. In this fact-check, we're talking about the Kochs' company, Koch Industries. Koch Industries operates over 100 plants across the country. According to one ranking, it is not responsible for the most significant releases but it does land within the top 30 on one list and the top 15 on another. Most people would count that as ""one of the biggest."" Most of those releases are legal under EPA permits. The EPA does not consider this level of pollution to pose a health risk in and of itself. However, it is still pollution. We rate the claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAB23C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/09/bob-beckel/bob-beckel-koch-brothers-are-one-biggest-polluters/
"['Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Obamacare will force 'an average premium increase between $50 and $90 per month' for Medicare Advantage recipients, Rick Scott says
","Gov. Rick Scott has made the Affordable Care Act’s cuts to Medicare Advantage a talking point early in his re-election campaign, no doubt spurred on by the fact more than 1.4 million Floridians are enrolled in the program. In an April 3, 2014, Spanish-language editorial in El Nuevo Herald, Scott brought up several talking points about the program, including threatened premium increases. ""Seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage are going to see an average premium increase between $50 and $90 per month,"" he wrote. Many private insurers warned premiums would increase under Obamacare, but we wondered if they would go up as high as Scott said. After Scott's op-ed published and while we were working on this report, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid announced it would give Medicare Advantage a little more money next year rather than a bit less. But we still wanted to see where Scott got his numbers from and if they added up. First, though, let’s take a look at how Medicare Advantage works. How is Medicare Advantage different? Medicare became available in 1965, offering retirees both hospital insurance (Part A) and medical insurance for doctors visits (Part B). Lawmakers in the 1970s started suggesting private insurers could offer Medicare benefits at a lower rate than the government-run program. By 2003, those private plans came to be known as Medicare Advantage. You can read about the differences between the government-run and private programs here. About 30 percent of all Medicare recipients nationwide are enrolled in an Advantage plan. That ratio is about the same in Florida, with 1.4 million in Medicare Advantage and 4.4 million enrolled in Medicare, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services says. The advantage in Medicare Advantage was ostensibly the savings private companies would realize over what the federal government pays. In reality, that’s not the case; Advantage plans were subsidized at about 14 percent more than regular plans by 2009, when Obamacare was being debated. Some estimates put that overage at about 9 percent or so now. When the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010, one of the attempts to pay for subsidized health insurance was to cut payments to the Medicare Advantage program to bring costs more in line with traditional Medicare. The proposal spurred an outcry from private insurers, which said the only alternatives they had were to cut services, shrink networks and increase premiums while cutting into the program’s enrollment. Enrollment has actually gone up, with a 9 percent increase between 2012 and 2013 alone, and about 30 percent since the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010. Parsing payments But what about premium increases? Insurance industry advocacy group America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) insists Advantage plans faced cuts of about 6 percent, after a combination of sequestration, a reduction in subsidies, the elimination of bonuses the government paid for quality plans and Obamacare’s tax on premiums. At the start of every year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sets rates for Medicare Advantage so private insurers can bid on selling policies. Those rates are then revised in April and set for the year. Scott’s campaign directed us to an AHIP-commissioned report from February 2013 that stated on a per member, per month basis, Medicare Advantage patients could potentially face premium increases and benefit reductions in 2014 that would cost $50 to $90 a month. It was a national number, not a Florida number, and was only an estimate based on that year’s preliminary suggestion from the government. (AHIP’s projected Florida increase was actually $50 to $60.) AHIP did not readjust its estimates after payments were set in April 2013. This year AHIP released a new report that stated on a per member, per month basis, Medicare Advantage patients nationwide could have faced premium increases of $35 to $75, te report said. In Florida those potential increases could have been $35 to $45 by 2015. AHIP spokesman Robert Zirkelbach said Scott used a number the group estimated, but it was taken from an old projection. ""It seems to me if they were looking ahead, they should have used $35 to $75 in the latest report,"" Zirkelbach said. He added such a number shouldn’t necessarily be used in definite terms, because AHIP changes its estimates based on the latest information. They will address the $35 to $45 estimate for Florida in this year’s report after they have analyzed the rates that were proposed April 7, he said. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services changed its initial estimate of a 1.9 percent rate cut to a 0.4 percent increase for next year. We have to note that we're checking what Scott said on April 3, before the federal government reversed its decision to cut payments for 2015 and slightly raise them instead. Even using an old estimate, Scott didn't know for sure that the cuts weren't going to happen. Other companies and insurance groups come up with their own projected cost increases, but they don’t reflect the trend that the Affordable Care Act seems to be doing what it set out to do: lowering the costs of Medicare Advantage. Joe Baker, president of the nonprofit Medicare Rights Center, said that despite the ""scare scenarios and sky-is-falling stuff,"" enrollment is increasing, premiums are down almost 10 percent and coverage hasn’t decreased. Premiums may one day increase, but that hasn’t been the trend since 2010, he said. ""People have been forecasting problems and none of those problems have occurred,"" Baker said. He added that the insurance industry lobbyists (and anti-Obamacare lawmakers) who have been fighting the payment reductions are defending the higher-cost private plans at the expense of the cheaper government-run option, and still manage to make Advantage plans profitable. ""They want to keep market share, so they keep their product competitive,"" he said. ""They want as much reimbursement as possible. They’re profit-making businesses, and even if they are nonprofit, they still care about margin."" Our ruling Scott said in a Spanish-language editorial that ""seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage are going to see an average premium increase between $50 and $90 per month."" That’s an estimate made by an insurance lobbying group back in 2013, based on government data that wasn’t finalized. Experts we spoke to pointed out the estimate also was created in the best interest of the industry, seeking to maximize government reimbursements for private Advantage plans. Even the group that commissioned the report from which the projection was culled says it wasn’t the proper number for Scott to use. We should note that the numbers changed again shortly after Scott's editorial appeared. But even before that, the numbers Scott used were off. It’s possible that one day premiums may increase, but data since 2010 don’t reflect that.

"['Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Florida', 'Republican Party of Florida']","
Charlie Crist supports Medicare Advantage cuts, Republican Party of Florida says
","Gov. Rick Scott used his visit to an assisted living facility in Tampa to create a campaign video to bash President Barack Obama over potential cuts to Medicare Advantage. Scott’s Republican Party of Florida goes a step further by portraying his likely Democratic opponent, former Gov. Charlie Crist, as an Obama supporter. ""I stand against Charlie Crist because he supports President Obama and the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program,"" said the Republican Party of Florida on Facebook April 1. They repeated the claim again on Twitter on April 9. It’s a fact that Crist supports Obama -- and the Affordable Care Act. (We traced Crist’s various positions on the law in 2010.) But does Crist support cuts to Medicare Advantage? Background on Medicare Advantage In Florida, about 1.4 million seniors are on Medicare Advantage while roughly 4.4 million are in traditional Medicare. The health care law tries to bring down future health care costs of Medicare largely by reducing Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans that are run by private insurers. The hope was that the increased competition from the private sector would reduce costs. But those plans are actually costlier than traditional Medicare. So the health care law reduces payments to private insurers. Advantage plans are required to offer basic health benefits that are at least as rich as original Medicare. But many offer extras, such as rebates on premiums, routine dental care, gym memberships and rides to the doctor, in order to compete for business. When the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010, one of the attempts to pay for subsidized health insurance was to cut payments to the Medicare Advantage program to bring costs more in line with traditional Medicare. The Congressional Budget Office has predicted these cuts would save the government about $156 billion over a decade. What Crist has said about cutting Medicare Advantage We searched for statements Crist made about Medicare Advantage starting in 2009 when he was Florida’s Republican governor. We found Crist has actually opposed changes to Medicare Advantage over the years. In December 2009, Crist released a statement in support of an amendment by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to protect Medicare and Medicare Advantage. As you’ll see from his rhetoric, Crist opposed the health care law back then: ""Cuts to Medicare would adversely affect Florida’s seniors who have paid into the program and rely on its services for their important health needs. ... Many of Florida’s seniors rely on Medicare Advantage for supplemental or increased benefit options. Stripping away a needed benefit from our seniors in order to move toward a single-payer system where bureaucrats are inserted between doctors and their patients is not the health reform Americans deserve."" In July 2010 -- after he became an independent while running for U.S. Senate -- Crist released another statement about his position on the health care bill. Here is a portion: ""Had I been in the United States Senate at the time, I would have voted against the bill because of unacceptable provisions like the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program. But being an independent, I have the freedom to be an honest broker for the people of Florida without regard for political party, and the reality is this: despite its serious flaws, the Obama health care bill does have some positive aspects. Repeal must be accompanied by a responsible substitute....."" In August 2010, he made a similar statement in which he said if he had been a senator, ""I would have voted against the bill because of unacceptable provisions like the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program."" Again he called for a ""responsible substitute."" Miami Herald politics reporter Marc Caputo wrote a column about Crist’s ""Obamacare conundrum"" in March 2014. Caputo quoted a statement by Crist: ""I don’t support the cuts to Medicare Advantage. In every major law, there are things you like and things you don’t. The president and Congress should fix it."" It’s not an unusual position to support the law and yet speak against changes for Medicare Advantage. In an election year, dozens of Democratic members of the House or Senate have spoken against Medicare Advantage rate reductions. At the time of RPOF’s claim, Medicare Advantage cuts were still on the table -- so we will limit our rating to information available at the time. However, we will note that after the federal government’s announcement that it would not reduce payments to Medicare Advantage, Crist tweeted on April 7: ""Great to learn that @BarackObama is reversing cuts to Medicare Advantage. This is great news for Florida seniors."" So what evidence does the Republican Party of Florida have that Crist supports the cuts? ""If he supports the law, he supports all of it,"" including Medicare Advantage cuts, RPOF spokeswoman Susan Hepworth told PolitiFact Florida in an email. One final footnote about Crist and Medicare Advantage. The federal government is depending on savings from Medicare Advantage to offset the costs of the Affordable Care Act. So we asked the Crist campaign, if Crist is against the Medicare Advantage cuts, what would he recommend to achieve the needed savings? We did not hear any specific solutions from Crist campaign spokesman Kevin Cate. ""It’s the responsibility of the president and Congress to fix any cuts to Medicare Advantage,"" Cate said. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said Crist supports ""cuts to the Medicare Advantage program."" Crist has flip-flopped on a lot of issues, including the federal health care law. He used to oppose the Affordable Care Act, but now he supports it. The law tries to bring down future health care costs by reducing Medicare Advantage payments. But on the issue of Medicare Advantage, Crist has actually been consistent: He's been critical of the Medicare Advantage cuts for years. He specifically said he opposed the reductions in 2009 and 2010, and he still opposes them today. Crist doesn’t appear to have come up with other ways to save money on health care without reducing payments to Medicare Advantage. But our purpose here is to fact-check the claim that he supports the cuts, and we found no proof that he does. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC86C80>],/factchecks/2014/apr/09/republican-party-florida/charlie-crist-supports-medicare-advantage-cuts-rep/
"['Georgia', 'Voting Record', 'Paul Broun']","
Broun says campaign rivals following his lead
","To hear one Georgia congressman tell it, he’s the pied piper of some of his colleagues in the U.S. House. ""It’s become a joke in Congress how Dr. (Phil) Gingrey and Mr. (Jack) Kingston have been following my votes,"" U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, R-Athens, told The Daily Beast, a news and lifestyle website. ""They’ve even changed votes to what I voted, multiple times. Members of Congress are laughing about it."" Broun, Gingrey and Kingston, veteran Georgia Republicans serving in the House, are vying for the same seat in the U.S. Senate this year, along with several other candidates. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out if Broun is correct or not about Gingrey and Kingston following his lead. All three have attempted to claim title as the most conservative candidate in the crowded GOP field. They have voted the same way all but a handful of times since 2013. Broun, though, has been the most vocal of the three men against some GOP initiatives, usually arguing they are not conservative enough. Since 2013, Broun is the only Republican House member from Georgia who has voted with his party less than 95 percent of the time, according to the website Open Congress. Broun has voted along party lines 87 percent of the time. Gingrey and Kingston have both voted along party lines at a 95 percent clip. Broun directed us to a handful of votes among the more than 700 votes taken by the House since the beginning of 2013 to make his case. Through spokesmen, both Gingrey and Kingston said Broun’s claims were absurd. But this fact-check really got interesting when we interviewed another member of Congress who told us a story about a recent vote concerning Broun and Kingston. On March 6, the House was preparing to vote on an aid package for Ukraine when Broun told his seatmate, U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., about his plan to play cloak and dagger in the U.S. Capitol. ""I’m voting no on this, but I’m going to wait until the end to see if (Gingrey and Kingston) change their votes once I vote,"" Massie said, quoting Broun. Gingrey and Kingston voted in favor of the legislation early during the voting period, Massie recalled. With one minute left, Broun followed through with his vote against the bill. As time expired, Massie said he looked up at the electronic board tracking how each member voted and noticed that Kingston voted against the legislation, House Resolution 4152. ""Hey, look at the board!"" Massie said. ""I told you so,"" Broun replied. Massie said he decided to share his story about the March 6 vote with PolitiFact Georgia after Gingrey and Kingston said that Broun was wrong in his assertion. ""To say Paul Broun is misleading would be false,"" Massie told us. Broun and Kingston did vote no, records show. Gingrey voted in favor of the legislation that day. Video is not allowed of the electronic board that records the votes, so there is no way to see if Kingston first voted in favor of the legislation. Video of the vote tally is permitted, and it shows the Republican vote count changed as the time expired from 195 in favor of the bill and 21 against it to 194 to 22. One more no vote was added to the Republican total after time expired. Massie said Broun’s prediction makes a strong argument about Kingston’s motives. ""I cannot tell you why (Kingston) changed his vote, but I can tell you he changed it after Paul Broun voted and Paul Broun predicted it would happen,"" Massie said. Kingston campaign spokesman Chris Crawford said Massie may have been looking at the vote change of another congressman. ""I don’t ever recall him voting for it,"" Crawford said of Kingston. ""I think Congressman Massie is mistaken. Perhaps he mistook something but Jack never voted for that bill."" Former Georgia congressman George ""Buddy"" Darden said some members will change their votes during the 15 minutes they have to vote on legislation. Sometimes, he said, they’ve voted on the wrong legislation. Sometimes, they’re unsure which way they want to vote. Sometimes, they’ll change their vote if an extra vote or two is needed for a bill to pass. Darden, a Democrat, stressed that a member’s vote is not official until it is recorded in the Congressional Record. So did Kingston switch his vote on HR 4152 and did he do it because Broun voted no? ""The only person who knows for sure is Jack Kingston,"" said Darden, senior counsel at the law firm McKenna, Long & Aldridge. About four weeks later, on April 1, the House took another vote on the Ukraine legislation. Records show Broun again voted no, Gingrey again voted yes but Kingston did not vote. Kingston, though, did not vote on other legislation that came before the House afterward, records show. The Broun campaign also directed us to news coverage to support his argument. The first was an article on the popular Washington, D.C., news site, Politico. It was written in March 2013, before Kingston announced he was running for the U.S. Senate. The article was about Broun ""yanking much of the congressional delegation to the right and throwing their votes and the support of leadership into a daily flux."" The Politico article reported that Kingston admitted that Broun’s rightward leanings were changing his voting pattern. Crawford, the Kingston spokesman, noted that the article ""doesn't provide a quote from Mr. Kingston but the impression of the reporter."" Politico reported in that article, Broun voted against a procedural motion concerning legislation to keep the government running. The article reported that the ""dominoes then began to fall. Kingston and Gingrey ended up voting against both the procedural motion and the resolution itself."" Broun’s case against Gingrey focused on news coverage such as the Politico story and a 2013 vote on raising the federal debt ceiling. Broun’s campaign shared a couple of tweets from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Washington bureau account that suggest Gingrey flip-flopped on the debt ceiling vote in 2013 after Broun voiced his opposition to the plan. The first tweet, on Jan. 22, 2013, showed that Gingrey was prepared to vote yes while Broun was the only Georgia lawmaker in the tweet who was planning to vote no. The second tweet, posted on Jan. 23, 2013, showed Broun and Gingrey voted against raising the debt ceiling. Gingrey spokesman Cameron Harley said the congressman’s votes were not being manipulated by Broun’s votes. ""The votes Congressman Gingrey takes on the House floor have always been driven by the conservative Georgia values embodied by his constituency and to suggest that they are driven by Congressman Broun is simply false,"" Harley said. ""There are myriad occasions where their votes have differed, including votes on policy critical to protecting Americans from Obamacare's most egregious provisions while Republicans work toward a full repeal. Furthermore, Congressman Gingrey has voted countless times not to raise the debt ceiling -- a hard stance he took long before announcing his candidacy for U.S. Senate. The will of his constituency has always been, and will always be, the only bellwether for his judgement as a public servant."" To sum up, Broun said in the article that fellow congressmen Gingrey and Kingston have ""even changed votes to what I voted, multiple times."" Broun’s case against Gingrey is a matter of perception. In Kingston’s case, it boils down to who do you believe? Broun, Massie or Kingston? It’s a case of ""he said, he said."" In general, the three candidates have voted the same way all but a handful of times since 2013. Broun needed more examples to prove this has happened multiple times. He may be correct about what happened concerning Kingston and the Ukraine vote, but there’s no way to know for sure. And if Kingston and Gingrey changed votes, there’s no way to know whether they did it because of Broun. Thus, his evidence is thin. Therefore, we rate Broun’s claim Mostly False. Under PolitiFact’s rating system, Mostly False means the claim contains some element of truth, but doesn’t tell the whole story.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB8D8C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/09/paul-broun/broun-says-campaign-rivals-following-his-lead/
"['Crime', 'Privacy Issues', 'Wisconsin', 'Chris Taylor']","
Bird-sized drones could record you inside your home, Chris Taylor says
","On April 1, 2014 state Rep. Chris Taylor warned the citizenry about eyes in the sky and attacks on privacy. ""Drone technology now allows an individual to be recorded in their homes by drones as small as birds and immediately uploaded to the internet,"" the Madison Democrat wrote in a news release. Was Taylor pulling the public’s leg on April Fools’ Day? No, she was dead serious. Taylor spoke the day the state Senate approved and sent to Gov. Scott Walker a bipartisan bill -- cosponsored by Taylor -- to put limits on drone use. The Wisconsin bill, similar to others around the country, attempts to prohibit both law enforcement agencies and private individuals from recording people in locations where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Example: inside their homes. Under the legislation, it would be unlawful in a criminal investigation for police -- without first getting a search warrant -- to use drones equipped with video or audio recording equipment to collect evidence in such locations. Emergency exceptions to this prohibition include locating an escaped prisoner, aiding in a search and rescue mission, executing an arrest warrant or preventing imminent harm to a person or the imminent destruction of evidence. The bill allows hobbyists, entrepreneurs or aerial photographers to use drones as long as that use does not intentionally violate an individual’s privacy interests. Gov. Scott Walker signed it into law on April 8, 2014. Taylor, in her statement, focuses on the state of the technology, not on who is doing the recording. Let’s see if she’s correct. Some basics first. Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are small aircraft that can fly by remote control without an onboard human operator. They can be part of a system that includes a digital network and personnel on the ground, and can be equipped with high-powered cameras, with infrared devices that sense objects through walls, and with laser radar that can see through trees and foliage, the Congressional Research Service said in a 2013 report. Their use by law enforcement and the military in the U.S. ""raises far-reaching issues concerning the extent of government surveillance authority, the value of privacy in the digital age, and the role of Congress in reconciling these issues,"" the report noted. To address Taylor’s specific statement, we turned to government studies, technology and privacy experts, law enforcement officials and drone manufacturers. The bottom line: A wide range of experts said Taylor’s scenario reflects the capability of current technology. Size  Drones can be as small as insects and as large as regular aircraft. Models used by law enforcement have included the Draganflyer X4-ES, which is just 24 inches wide, and the AeroVironment Wasp, described as ""bird-size"" in a Washington Post story about Texas police conducting discreet video surveillance before a SWAT team stormed a property that officials believed had a cache of weapons. A tiny drone developed for the U.S. military weighs less than a AA battery and resembles a live hummingbird that can hover, climb, fly through an open doorway and relay real-time video back to its operator, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. That drone, AeroVironment’s Nano Hummingbird, could someday provide new reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities in urban environments, the AeroVironment website says. Someday, because it’s not in production yet. Army-technology.com said in 2012 that UAVs ""are getting smaller and more agile to enable combatants to gather intelligence from hard to reach areas, such as in buildings and through tunnels."" Internet A Draganflyer official told us it’s easy to upload the live video images that a remote operator is viewing. It just takes some additional equipment. ""That’s a minor thing as far as I’m concerned,"" said Kevin Lauscher, a former police officer who is now sales manager and flight trainer at Draganfly Innovations. ""The realistic expectation of privacy is pretty weak in these days of technology"" and people recording conversations and posting photos with their phones, he said. Recording people in their homes Taylor aide Craig Trost told us the representative meant recording through a window, not with see-through-walls camera technology that is still under development. Taking pictures of people inside their home is possible with a drone, various law enforcement officials told us. Image quality would be a major challenge though. Daniel Schwarzbach, a pilot for the Houston Police and executive director of the Airborne Law Enforcement Association, said police could film people through their windows after getting a search warrant but he doesn’t recall that happening or police being interested in it. So, Taylor’s description of drone capabilities is not imaginary. How likely it is to happen? That’s an important question, and we got an earful on it, though we don’t think the answer bears directly on the accuracy of her warning about what is possible with current technology. ""Doing what she is afraid of would be difficult at best, it would be illegal under peeping Tom laws, and it’s not on the agenda of law enforcement,"" said Gregory McNeal,  a national security and criminal law expert at Pepperdine University law school. McNeal added: ""If she is worried about invasions of privacy, she should update Wisconsin’s invasion of privacy laws for all forms of observation, not just drones because what she’s alleging can be done by a drone can be done with an iPhone, any camera, or binoculars."" The privacy issue is not about unmanned aircraft, it is about image capture and retention, in the view of  Alan Frazier, a University of North Dakota aviation professor and former Grand Forks County sheriff’s deputy.  ""Agencies need to have  a robust policy in place regarding appropriate uses of all types of image capture devices,"" he said. Taylor, a lawyer, says it’s not at all clear that current law criminalizes peeping remotely using a drone. Law enforcement officials using drones told us a rogue user might try to do that, but not them. ""We cannot look into homes, our systems are twice the size of a goose and we don't operate in areas where we have internet,  nor do we have, or need, the desire to upload anything to the internet …"" said Ben Miller, director of the Mesa County, Colorado, unmanned aircraft systems program. ""We mostly take aerial pictures of crime scenes and conduct aerial search and rescue flights."" Taylor, for the record, says she wasn’t suggesting that law enforcement was illegally peeking into windows, just the possible uses of the technology. Allie Bohm, advocacy and policy strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union, said a hobbyist could buy a drone size of a large bird and put a camera on it and get video and put it on the Internet. But Bohm called that a ""side issue"" because there’s no evidence drones are being widely employed in that fashion, in part due to Federal Aviation Administration rules, Bohm said. Public entities seeking to fly drones must get FAA approval. More than 1,800 have done so since 2007, including law enforcement, firefighting, border patrol, disaster relief, search and rescue, military training, and other government operational missions, the FAA says. (The Milwaukee Police Department does not own or use drones, spokesman Mark Stanmeyer told us.) Under current FAA rules, a drone must be flown within the line of sight of the operator, less than 400 feet above the ground, during daylight conditions, inside uncontrolled airspace and more than five miles from any airport or other location with aviation activities. ""Flying model aircraft solely for hobby or recreational reasons does not require FAA approval, but hobbyists must operate according to the agency's model aircraft guidance,"" FAA spokesman Les Dorr said in a statement. Commercial operations are only authorized on a case-by-case basis and to date, only one has met these criteria, using Insitu's ScanEagle.  A commercial flight requires a certified aircraft, a licensed pilot and operating approval. That authorization was limited to the Arctic. Our rating Taylor said that ""drone technology now allows an individual to be recorded in their homes by drones as small as birds and immediately uploaded to the internet."" There are legal and operational obstacles to making this scenario a reality, we learned. But Taylor’s carefully worded statement was about the state of the technology, and her scenario is technically possible right now. We rate her statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAAF1240>],/factchecks/2014/apr/09/chris-taylor/bird-sized-drones-could-record-you-inside-your-hom/

Democratic group assails Koch Brothers' role in Louisiana Senate race
","Charles and David Koch, the deep-pocketed, libertarian industrialists, seem to be all over the airwaves these days. If it’s not campaign ads being run by such Koch-supported affiliates as Americans for Prosperity, then it’s ads run by Democrats attacking candidates favored by the Koch brothers. One ad from a pro-Democratic group, the Senate Majority PAC, attacks Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu in 2014. The ad features images of storm devastation -- a hot-button issue for Louisiana residents, who faced several deadly hurricanes in the past decade. Here’s the narration: ""We’ve been battered by hurricanes, lost everything to floods. And for thousands of Louisianans, flood insurance and hurricane relief are our only protection. But the out-of-state billionaire Koch brothers funded the fight to let flood insurance premiums soar, helping the insurance companies and cut off hurricane relief for Louisiana families. Now they’re spending millions to buy a Senate seat for Bill Cassidy so he can fight for them. If the Kochs and Cassidy win, Louisiana loses."" That’s a lot of information to weigh on the Truth-O-Meter, so we decided to zero in on this claim -- that the Koch brothers ""funded the fight to let flood insurance premiums soar"" and ""now they’re spending millions to buy a Senate seat for Bill Cassidy so he can fight for them."" We’ll start by offering a hat-tip to the Washington Post Fact Checker, who gave this ad Four Pinocchios, saying that ""individual lines may be true, but the net effect is highly misleading."" Did the Koch brothers fund ""the fight to let flood insurance premiums soar""? While the money flowing in and out of such groups as Americans for Prosperity is hard to pin down, it’s pretty clear that the group took a strong stance in a congressional debate over flood insurance. Here’s the background. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Act of 2012 overhauled the National Flood Insurance Program, a federal program that provides insurance in a market -- flood insurance -- that has been historically neglected. The 2012 bill sought to bring risk and premiums into closer balance, so that flood insurance would become less of a drain on the federal treasury. It did this in part by phasing out subsidies to a portion of policyholders, at least until a policy lapses or a property is sold. For some policyholders, this meant premium rises -- a problem particularly acute in states with heavily populated coastlines. After it was passed and the size of the increases became clearer, lawmakers in these states -- including Louisiana -- felt pressure from constituents to modify the Biggert-Waters law. So lawmakers put together legislation that capped annual individual property rate increases at 18 percent, restored a grandfather rule, and refunded some premiums already paid. On March 21, 2014, President Barack Obama signed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act into law. So how do the Koch brothers fit into this? Their affiliate, Americans for Prosperity, joined a wide range of other conservative groups in signing a letter opposing some of the proposed changes to Biggert-Waters. ""Americans for Prosperity is proud to join a coalition urging Congress not to pass the Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act,"" the group said in a post on its website. ""The bill delays many of the critical reforms of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 that puts the National Flood Insurance Program in a better position going forward."" The joint letter signed by AFP said the proposed legislation permitted the return of ""subsidies that distort the market, belie the foundation of the NFIP, and expose taxpayers to further debt. Conservative organizations should oppose this legislation and educate and activate their supporters in opposition."" Levi Russell, director of public affairs with Americans for Prosperity, disputes the notion that opposition to the legislation means allowing ""flood insurance premiums to soar,"" saying the group supported an alternative proposed by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that would have offered Louisiana policyholders some relief. But that was earlier in the process. The Toomey proposal was dead by the time the group signed the letter cited above, and it only talks about blocking the proposed overhaul, not presenting an alternative. Ultimately, a prominent advocacy groups funded by the Koch brothers, AFP, took a strong stance against House legislation to curb premium increases for flood-insurance policyholders. Are the Koch brothers ""spending millions to buy a Senate seat for Bill Cassidy so he can fight for them""? AFP has run a number of ads against Landrieu, including this one, this one, this one, this one, and this one. It’s worth noting some legal caveats. Americans for Prosperity is a 501(c)(4) group, meaning that it can advocate for political issues but cannot urge votes for or against a specific candidate. This is why its ads typically urge viewers to ""tell"" Landrieu that they oppose this issue or that or to call her office, rather than suggesting they vote for her opponent. In addition, the group’s legal status means that it cannot coordinate with the Cassidy campaign (or with the campaign of any other Landrieu opponent). So even if it’s true that the Koch brothers want to ""buy"" a Senate seat for Cassidy, it’s not the kind of support Cassidy can actively court. Still, Cassidy hasn’t exactly renounced them, either. The Baton Rouge Advocate reported that in January, Cassidy and AFP held events at the same restaurant in Covington, La., within 30 minutes of each other, and that between the events, Cassidy told someone from AFP, ""Thank y’all for the ads you’re running. Obviously, you care deeply about our country, and Obamacare is a bad thing."" So, viewed in isolation, both of these claims contain a lot of truth. Case closed? Not so fast. There’s a gaping omission in the Senate Majority PAC ad that undercuts the suggestion that Cassidy is simply a puppet of the Kochs. What’s missing? The Senate Majority PAC ad ignores that the bill so strongly opposed by AFP and other conservative groups was, to a large degree, shepherded by none other than Rep. Bill Cassidy. In fact, the measure was officially known as the ""Grimm-Cassidy substitute amendment."" The ""Grimm"" in the bill’s name -- Rep. Michael Grimm, R-N.Y. -- wrote a letter to the New Orleans Times-Picayune touting Cassidy’s role. ""I am extremely grateful to Dr. Cassidy for being such a dedicated partner in our efforts to protect homeowners throughout the country,"" Grimm wrote. ""Without his contributions, the House's ability to forestall the catastrophic effects of Biggert-Waters and pass a far-reaching relief bill for the hard-working folks from the Big Apple to the Big Easy may never have been realized at all."" Cassidy provided an exhaustive timeline of his involvement in the flood-insurance legislation in a news release here. So, in the case of flood insurance, Cassidy was working hard to enact the proposal that Koch-affliliated groups opposed. Our ruling The Senate Majority PAC ad said the Koch brothers ""funded the fight to let flood insurance premiums soar ... Now they’re spending millions to buy a Senate seat for Bill Cassidy so he can fight for them."" Two major Koch-funded groups opposed the legislative rewrite of the flood-insurance law, and AFP has been airing a lot of ads attacking Cassidy’s opponent. But the ad’s message is significantly undermined by its suggestion that Cassidy is a puppet of the Kochs, particularly on flood insurance. The reality is that Cassidy sided with constituents and against the AFP position on flood insurance as recently as last month. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. Correction: The initial version of this story incorrectly stated that FreedomWorks receives funding from the Koch brothers. While FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity were both split off from Citizens for a Sound Economy, a now-defunct group founded and funded in part by the Koch brothers, there is no evidence that FreedomWorks receives any Koch brothers funding today. This change does not affect our ruling of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB1EAC0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/08/senate-majority-pac/democratic-group-assails-koch-brothers-role-louisi/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Jay Carney']","
White House says most of those helped by its minimum-wage hike are full-time workers, with average age of 35
","White House Press Secretary Jay Carney did his part last week to promote President Barack Obama’s proposal to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10. In a tweet on April 3, 2014, Carney forwarded a meme created by the White House. It read: ""Who will raising the minimum wage actually help? You might be surprised that: More than half are women. More than half work full-time. The average worker is 35 years old."" We recently checked a similar claim about women and the minimum wage and found it Mostly True. But we thought it would be worth checking the claims that more than half of those who’d be helped by a minimum-wage increase currently work full-time, and that the average worker who would be helped is 35 years old. When we first looked at the data, we were suspicious. Numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics we had used in previous fact checks seemed to tell a different story. But as we’ll see, the White House has found another way to look at the numbers. When we asked the White House for their supporting data, they pointed us to a slideshow from the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers and a study by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal group. The specific data points in the meme appear be drawn from the institute’s study. The Economic Policy Institute study made its calculations using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Rather than studying just the people earning the minimum wage today, it looked at anyone earning less than $10.10 an hour. There’s some logic behind this. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 doesn’t just raise wages for those earning $7.25 an hour, but rather for everybody earning less than $10.10. In addition, David Cooper, the author of the report, told PolitiFact that his calculations actually included everyone currently earning up to $11.10. That’s a dollar more than Obama’s proposed minimum wage level, but this decision was based on the assumption that anyone earning slightly above $10.10 at the time of the minimum-wage hike would also get a small boost, in order to keep them nestled correctly in a company’s wage hierarchy. Reasonable people can differ about the wisdom of these assumptions, but the important point for this fact-check is that doing it EPI’s way produces a starkly different image of the low-income workforce than one would get from looking just at people who earn the minimum wage today. (This data is available in a Bureau of Labor Statistics report released last month, ""Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers, 2013."") To see these distinctions in action, let’s start with the question of full-time versus part-time work.   Hours worked per week EPI data (workers earning up to $11.10) BLS data (workers currently earning minimum wage or less) Less than 20 14.2% 22% 20-34 hours 32.0% 43% More than 35 hours (""full time"") 53.8% 35%   This chart shows that, according to the study cited by the White House, almost 54 percent of workers earning up to $11.10 worked more than 35 hours a week, which is considered ""full time."" That helps the White House create a sympathetic image -- a person working long hours to support themselves, rather than someone just looking for some extra spending money. If, however, you use the BLS report, which looks at people who currently earn the minimum wage, a much smaller share of minimum-wage workers -- just 35 percent -- worked ""full time."" Using this data, almost two-thirds of minimum-wage workers work part time, more closely fitting the preferred image of wage-hike opponents. Now let’s look at age. First, we should note that the White House did a bit of cherry-picking. It cited EPI’s ""average"" age of 35, when the median age -- the exact midpoint in the distribution of ages -- is several years younger at 30, Cooper told PolitiFact. Now, here is the full breakdown:   Age EPI data (workers earning up to $11.10) BLS data (workers currently earning minimum wage or less) Less than 20 12.5% 40% 20-29 36.5% 31% 30-39 16.6% 11% 40-54 20.8% 12% 55 and over 13.7% 6%   The numbers from EPI and the White House show a noticeably older skew to low-income workers. A slight majority of workers earning under $11.10 are at least 30 years old, according to their favored data. But if you look just at minimum wage workers using the BLS data, a full 71 percent are younger than 30. So the White House can paint a picture of middle-aged and older Americans getting a boost from the proposal, since a majority of the people helped by a $11.10 minimum wage are at least 30 years old. At the same time, opponents of the wage hike can counter that today’s minimum-wage earners are basically kids just starting out, since a plurality of current minimum-wage earners are younger than 20. In other words, the predominant image of who benefits from a minimum-wage hike depends on whether you factor in, or leave out, Americans who earn between $7.25 and $10.10 an hour. Weighing the value of both models In reality, both approaches have some pitfalls. Even as the White House asks, ""Who will raising the minimum wage actually help?"" the meme sidesteps any mention of who might be hurt from raising the wage to $10.10. In February, the independent Congressional Budget Office looked at the impact of the $10.10 proposal and found both positives and negatives. On the upside, the change would raise salaries for 16.5 million people and lift 900,000 out of poverty. On the downside, total employment could be reduced -- possibly by as much as 1 million, but more likely by around 500,000. By not acknowledging this estimate, the White House presents a one-sided view of its policy proposal. Yet those who would cite the BLS study also have their own shortcomings to acknowledge. The BLS report on minimum wage workers describes only those workers making exactly the federal minimum wage of $7.25 and below. It doesn’t include workers in states with higher state minimum wages, Cooper said -- even the ""minimum wage"" worker in Missouri who makes $7.35 per hour. Because 21 states and the District of Columbia have state minimums that exceed the federal minimum, slightly more than half the nation’s workforce is excluded from the BLS study, making the usefulness of its data somewhat questionable. ""Although both approaches present reasonable ways of describing the characteristics of those that will be affected by a raise in the minimum wage, neither one necessarily properly characterizes who will be helped by a raise in the minimum wage,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. Our ruling The White House meme asked, ""Who will raising the minimum wage actually help? … More than half work full-time. The average worker is 35 years old."" The White House’s math is credible because it carefully framed the question as ""who gains from a minimum-wage hike to $10.10,"" rather than ""who currently earns the minimum wage"" -- a common yardstick used by its opponents. Still, the White House’s portrayal is somewhat one-sided because it leaves out the negative impacts of raising the minimum wage, which have been pointed out by such independent groups as the CBO. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA11A00>],/factchecks/2014/apr/08/jay-carney/white-house-says-most-those-helped-its-minimum-wag/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'Republican Party of Florida']","
Charlie Crist raised taxes in 2009 and won't rule out raising taxes again Republican Party of Florida says
","Gov. Rick Scott signed a bill that will cut auto tag fees and pointed the finger at his predecessor for raising them in the first place. ""We are going to right the wrong of the 2009 tax increase that Charlie Crist enacted,"" Scott said as he signed the fee rollback on April 2. Scott, a Republican, is expected to face Democratic frontrunner Crist in November. The Republican Party of Florida joined the Crist-as-tax-hiker chorus on Twitter: ""[email protected] raised taxes in 2009 and won't rule out raising taxes again."" We’ll examine what type of taxes were raised under Crist in 2009 and what he has said about raising taxes in the future. Crist signed tax and fee increases in 2009 In May 2009, then-Republican Gov. Crist signed a $66.5 billion budget that included a slew of new taxes and fees -- roughly $2 billion worth -- intended to balance the state budget during the recession. The hikes included auto tag fees, a $1-a-pack cigarette tax, as well as higher fees to visit state parks and to file civil lawsuits and foreclosure actions. There is no dispute that Crist signed those tax and fee increases into law, but the Republican Party of Florida omits that the tax and fee hikes were supported by the Republican-led Legislature at the time. That includes influential Republican legislators who now in key leadership positions: Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, who was House majority whip at the time; House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel; and Senate President Don Gaetz. Recently, Crist made no apologies for supporting the auto tag increase when he spoke during an event in Tampa on the same day that Scott signed the cut into law. ""We had to get through a tough time, and sometimes you have to make difficult decisions,"" Crist said in Tampa. ""And we saved thousands of teachers' jobs, law enforcement officers' jobs, firefighters' jobs."" What Crist has said about the potential for future tax increases As for Crist’s willingness to raise future taxes, the Republican Party of Florida pointed to a brief clip of MSNBC’s Ed Schultz interviewing Crist on Nov. 18, 2013, a couple of weeks after Crist declared his candidacy. We went looking for the complete exchange about taxes; here’s how it went: Schultz: ""What is your philosophy of taxation? What would you do different. We have income inequality as a huge issue in this country. The wealthy seem to get the breaks. They have under the conservative rule. What would you do differently? What would you do with Florida’s finances and what would you expect? Would you expect more out of the wealthiest residents?"" Crist: ""Well, I think we all have to expect more out of each other. I don’t like to raise taxes. I don’t know that anybody really enjoys the idea of doing that. I did that as a governor, though."" Schultz: ""Would you do it again?"" Crist: ""If necessary, I would. I mean, you know."" Schultz: ""Is it necessary now?"" Crist: ""We have the highest budget we’ve had in the history of Florida right now at $74 billion. So, I don’t know if it’s necessary right now. I like to live within our means if we possibly can do so, but we have to properly fund public education. We have to properly fund the needs of the most vulnerable in our society. And when Governor Scott got elected, the very first session, he whacked public education funding by $1.3 billion."" Schultz: ""Would you restore that?"" Crist: ""Absolutely, we’d restore that."" Schultz: ""So that money would come back in under Charlie Crist."" Crist: ""Yes sir. It would. And the $300 million, he took out of higher ed the second session."" Schultz: ""And how would you pay for it?"" Crist: ""Pay for it by the existing revenues that we have. And if necessary, if we have to raise taxes, I would do it, but I’d rather not if we don’t have to. Like I said, I like to live within our means."" Crist’s campaign website includes a mention of ""tax cuts for middle-class families"" on his policy position page about the economy and jobs, but it’s vague. It states: ""Today, Florida’s tax policy works only if you are a special interest with a lobbyist – but it fails everyday Floridians and small business owners. As Governor, Charlie will reform government to put the people first, using incentives to help homegrown Florida small businesses grow the economy from the middle class out, not simply giving handouts to political supporters."" We sent the claim by the Republican Party to Crist’s campaign and an informal adviser to the campaign, former state Sen. Steve Geller. Geller said Crist supports giving small businesses a tax break and pointed to part of Crist’s announcement speech in November: ""As governor, we are going to have a tax policy that puts you the people first – and when we can cut taxes – and I do believe in cutting taxes – it is you the people who would get the relief – and when we spend money to help business, we are using it to grow the economy from the middle class out, not simply giving it away to supporters."" Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said that Crist ""raised taxes in 2009 and won’t rule out raising taxes again."" Crist -- along with the Republican-led Legislature -- did raise the cigarette tax and a slew of fees including auto tag fees in 2009 to balance the budget during a recession. When asked in November if he would raise taxes in the future, Crist said ""if necessary."" The Republicans omitted Crist’s softer language in the same interview when he added, ""I don’t know if it’s necessary right now.""

Jerry Patterson flew solo among statewide elected officials by advocating guest-worker plank in 2012 state party platform
","Jerry Patterson, an unsuccessful candidate for lieutenant governor this year, subsequently said that he somewhat uniquely spoke out for a federal guest-worker program a few years ago. According to a March 30, 2014, news story in the San Antonio Express-News, Republicans including state Sen. Dan Patrick of Houston, who's in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the party's lieutenant governor nomination with incumbent David Dewhurst, have talked about not putting language supportive of a guest-worker program in this year’s party platform, which is to be finalized by delegates to the next state convention in June 2014. Patrick has stumped on securing the Texas-Mexico border, also objecting in a Jan. 25, 2014, Twitter post to the ""illegal invasion."" The Express-News story described Patterson, the state land commissioner since 2003, as saying he was the only statewide elected official to speak in favor of the guest-worker plank at the June 2012 state convention where it was initially adopted. Patterson separately said on his 2014 campaign website: ""Many of my elected colleagues privately expressed support, but told me that they just couldn’t take the risk."" Did Patterson, who often flies his own plane between cities, venture solo in this way? Immigration in 2012 platform The immigration plank, on page 21 of the platform, states that mass deportation of all the undocumented individuals in the United States ""would neither be equitable nor practical,"" while ""blanket amnesty"" would only encourage more illegal entries. The plank also calls for securing the border, modernizing Social Security cards and limiting birthright citizenship to babies born to a U.S. citizen. Finally, the plank calls for a temporary worker program ""to bring skilled and unskilled workers into the United States for temporary periods of time when no U.S. workers are currently available,"" to be self-funded through participation fees and fines, the plank says. The guest-worker plank was characterized by proponents at the time as a meaningful breakthrough for the state party. A June 9, 2012, Texas Tribune news story quoted TexasGOPvote.com's Bob Price, a convention delegate, as saying adoption of the guest-worker provisions ""takes away a tool that Democrats have used for years to drive a wedge between conservative Hispanics and Republicans."" William Kelberlan, a delegate from Williamson County, told the Tribune: ""It was a tough pill to swallow; it didn't go down easily."" Kelberlan said he recognized the need for immigration reform but thought more time was needed to hammer out the details of what form it should take. Patterson spoke in favor of the guest-worker plank, according to the story, but it was silent on whether he was the sole statewide elected official to do so. Patterson invokes 'cojones' To our inquiry, Patterson indicated he remembers his solo status well. ""Ain’t much to elaborate,"" he said by email. Asked if he’d heard the speeches given by other statewide elected officials and why he knows he was alone in this regard, Patterson replied: ""I know all the statewides. I know what they do and say. I know who has cojones"" (um, courage) ""and who doesn't. I was the only one."" By email, Steve Munisteri, the party chairman, confirmed Patterson was the only statewide elected official to speak during floor debate of the guest-worker plank and then only after delegates agreed to let him do so, Munisteri said. Separately, Brad Bailey told us he helped draft the relevant language as a delegate from Senate District 11 in Houston. By phone, Bailey said Patterson was alone among statewide elected officials in speaking about the guest-worker section. Main speeches lacked mention of guest-worker idea We didn't have to take anyone's word for this. Munisteri reminded us the party placed video recordings of the convention online. So we watched the speeches given by several statewide elected officials: U.S. Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn; Gov. Rick Perry; Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst; Attorney General Greg Abbott; Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples and State Comptroller Susan Combs. None — plus Patterson, in his main speech to the convention — aired support for a guest-worker law. In fact, only Staples mentioned conditions near the Texas-Mexico border. Patterson spoke from floor during platform debate But as delegates discussed the party platform, Patterson stepped to a microphone on the convention floor after Munisteri adjudged that two-thirds of the delegates, by a show of hands, had agreed to suspend the rules to let him join the conversation even though he wasn’t a delegate. (Hear Patterson’s remarks starting about the 11:15 mark of the video here.) Patterson opened by describing himself as a conservative who believes the platform’s immigration plank and border security ""go hand in hand."" He then said he supported the then-pending state law requiring most voters to present photo identification at the polls as well as initiatives stressing English as the state’s primary language. Patterson said he also supported a physical barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border, including a fence in some cases. He added that he opposed ""unconditional birthright citizenship,"" bilingual ""balance"" and restrictions on police officers asking someone’s immigration status during an apprehension or investigation of a crime. Further, he said, he was opposed to amnesty for illegal immigrants. But, Patterson said, ""I will tell you… that I very loudly, firmly and with great fervor support… a guest-worker program as part of our border security."" ""We have folks in this country who are here to do us harm,"" Patterson said. ""They are criminal, they are coyotes, they run things back and across the border whether they are illegals, whether they are drugs or contraband. ""And we also have folks in this country,"" Patterson continued, ""who want to work hard, pay their taxes, obey our laws. And there is no way for those to come here and do that lawfully because our immigration system is broken. We need a guest-worker, temporary guest-worker program that is in the immigration plank in our platform,"" he said. Our ruling Patterson said he was unique among statewide elected officials in speaking for the guest-worker section that became part of the Republican Party of Texas platform in 2012. True.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Alisha Thomas Morgan']","
Lawmaker seeks passing grade on CRCT claim
","A state lawmaker surprised us recently when she talked about what she said is the low threshold for Georgia students to pass an important exam. ""In order to pass the CRCT in Georgia, you simply have to get half of the answers correct,"" said state Rep. Alisha Thomas Morgan, a Democrat from Cobb County. Surely, Georgia students have to do better than that? PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d do some homework on the representative’s claim. Morgan is running for state schools superintendent and was speaking against legislation that would create a study committee to look into the hotly debated Common Core policy and the federal government’s ""increasingly greater role in public education."" The legislation, House Resolution 550, passed along party lines in the Republican-led state House by more than a 2-to-1 ratio. Morgan voted against the legislation. The CRCT stands for the Criterion-Referenced Competency Test. State law requires Georgia public school students in grades 3 through 8 to take the CRCT in reading, English/language arts, math, science and social studies. Students in grades 3, 5 and 8 must meet or exceed state standards in reading to be promoted to the next grade. Fifth- and eighth-graders must also meet or exceed state standards in math to be promoted. In 2013, most Georgia students met or exceeded standards, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. When Morgan made her remarks during the debate on HR 550, she was referring to the ""cut scores"" to meet state standards, said Michael Brewer, her deputy campaign manager. Cut scores vary from subject area and grade level. Georgia has two sets of cut scores: one for students who meet state standards and another for students who exceed the standards. In order to meet state standards, students have to get only about one-half of the answers correct in a content area. Georgia students must get at least 75 percent to 80 percent of the answers correct in order to exceed state standards. Matt Cardoza, a spokesman for state Schools Superintendent John Barge, told us the state wants to see higher scores, which may happen as soon as the 2014-15 school year. ""Our standards are definitely too low, and it needs to be higher,"" Cardoza said. Brewer sent us an article with the scores for the 2011-12 school year. The numbers show the cut scores were 50 percent or less in 16 of the 30 subjects for the six grade levels, also known as content areas. The highest pass rate was for third-grade math, at 57 percent. The Georgia Department of Education sent us cut scores for 2012 and 2013. The 2012 cut scores were slightly different than what was in the article Brewer sent us, but they support Morgan’s claim. The cut scores were 50 percent or less in 17 of the 30 content areas. The highest cut score was for fourth-grade math, at 58 percent. In 2013, the cut scores were 50 percent or less in 18 of the 30 content areas. The highest cut score was for third- and fourth-grade math, at 57 percent. Scott Marion, associate director of the Center for Assessment, a New Hampshire-based nonprofit that works with schools to improve student achievement, said Morgan’s claim ""is probably right,"" but it requires deeper understanding. Marion said the CRCT’s cut scores do not offer a true understanding of how well students understand course material. ""If everybody gets (the answers right), it’s giving me no information to understand the range of performance in a state,"" said Marion, who has worked with educators in Georgia. Marion used the example of Advanced Placement exams, which are widely recognized as meaningful indicators of student proficiency. He noted that to score a 3 on most of the AP exams — the minimum score on a scale of 5 that is acceptable for college credit — generally requires getting about 50 percent to 60 percent of the multiple-choice questions correct. AP tests also include essay questions. ""This is a good score on a challenging test,"" Marion said. ""But it is certainly not comparable to the traditional percent correct metric used for classroom assessment."" Our conclusion Morgan said ""in order to pass the CRCT in Georgia, you simply have to get half of the answers correct."" In slightly more than half of the subjects for grades 3 through 8, she’s correct. The ""cut scores"" to meet state standards are a little higher in other areas, but not much higher. We believe Morgan’s statement is largely on target but slightly missed some context. Our rating: Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC91A8C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/08/alisha-thomas-morgan/lawmaker-seeks-passing-grade-crct-claim/

McAuliffe says the Medicaid fraud rate in Virginia is 0.47 percent
","Gov. Terry McAuliffe says there’s not much fraud in Virginia’s Medicaid program. He offered a statistic to prove his point during a recent interview with WRVA radio host Jimmy Barrett. McAuliffe: ""Well if you read the Richmond Times-Dispatch, I think it was yesterday, they did the political fact-check, and I give them credit for that. They answered the question. Do you know what the fraud rate is, Jimmy, in Virginia? Do you have any idea?"" Barrett: ""No what’s the fraud rate?"" McAuliffe: ""Well, you had one delegate going around saying it was 30 percent. It was fact-checked yesterday. Point-four-seven percent, less than half a percent. That’s the facts."" Our ears perked for two reasons: 1) We had never written a fact-check that said the fraud rate of Virginia’s Medicaid program is 0.47 percent, and; 2) We thought it was high time to do that fact-check now. Brian Coy, a McAuliffe spokesman, said the governor erred when he cited a March 23 Truth-O-Meter as the source for the 0.47 percent figure. That article examined a claim by Del. Jimmie Massie, R-Henrico, that 30 percent of the state’s Medicaid program was ""lost to waste, fraud and inefficiencies."" We rated the claim Mostly False, saying that no study has ever quantified the amount of fraud, waste and inefficiency in Virginia’s system. Coy said the governor made a simple mistake, conflating our story with a fraud figure his staff had just provided to him.   So that brings us to the next matter: Is the Medicare fraud rate 0.47 percent in Virginia? It’s an important question because the General Assembly is divided over expanding eligibility for the program to an additional 400,000 low-income and disabled Virginians under provisions of the Affordable Care Act. McAuliffe and the Democratic-controlled state Senate support the growth, noting that the federal government will pick up the entire tab for the next three years and 90 percent of the cost down the road. But the Republican-led House has twice rejected the expansion, maintaining, among other things, that Medicaid is rife with waste and should not be expanded before the abuse is curbed. The governor sought to refute the GOP argument by offering the 0.47 percent figure. But contrary to his statement, the statistic is not a measurement of Medicaid fraud. That figure is part of a ""payment error rate measurement"" compiled by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It’s a computation of the percentage of Medicaid bills that were paid for services Virginians were ineligible to receive. Some of the errors result from fraud and some come from simple clerical mistakes. Each state’s error rate is examined every three years. ""It is important to note the error rate is not a ‘fraud rate’ but simply a measurement of payments that did not meet statutory, regulatory or administrative requirements,"" the CMS says on its website. Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, sounded the same warning, ""It’s not a very accurate indicator of fraud,"" he told us. ""It’s not really set up to measure fraud."" We should note Virginia, under this measurement, seems to perform well, Nationally, 3.3 percent of Medicaid payments go to services for ineligible people. But CMS discourages such comparisons, saying that the sample of bills reviewed from each state is small. There have been studies in recent years estimating as much as 30 percent of all healthcare spending across the nation is lost to waste, fraud and inefficiencies. But the authors of those reports, as we pointed out in our story on Del. Massie’s claim, stress that their estimates don’t carry over to individual states, let alone the Medicaid program in any one state. Pinpointing Medicaid fraud rates is all but impossible. ""Some (fraud) is found out eventually, but a lot of it, most of it, is never detected,"" explained Kip Piper, a former senior advisor to the Centers on Medicare and Medicaid Services.   The Department of Medical Assistance Services, which oversees Virginia’s Medicaid system, does not try to calculate a fraud percentage. ""There is no officially designated term or standardized metric to calculate a ‘fraud rate,’"" Craig Markva, a DMAS spokesman, wrote in an email. Our ruling McAuliffe said the state has a fraud rate of 0.47 percent and that PolitiFact Virginia had verified that figure. A spokesman for the governor said McAuliffe made an innocent mistake in saying we found the statistic to be correct. In fact, we had never looked at the figure until now, and a number of experts told us that the governor erred in interpreting it as a fraud rate. The 0.47 is a computation of the percentage of Medicaid bills that were paid in 2012 for services that Virginians were ineligible to receive. Some of those errors resulted from deceit and some were simply caused by clerical errors. Neither the state nor the federal government offer a standard measurement of Medicaid fraud because much of the abuse is undetected. So the governor comes up empty.
