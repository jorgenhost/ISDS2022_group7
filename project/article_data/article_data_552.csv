American Family Association host: Persuading 'men not to have sex with men' will end AIDS
","Some of the 298 passengers who died aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 were HIV/AIDS researchers and advocates headed for the 20th International AIDS Conference in Australia, a fact President Barack Obama mentioned after the plane was shot down over eastern Ukraine. Obama also said in July 18 comments about the crash that ""the United States of America is going to continue to stand for the basic principle that people have the right to live as they choose."" That touched a nerve with Bryan Fischer, director of issues analysis of the conservative American Family Association. Fischer claimed that Obama was using the MH 17 downing as a platform to legitimize gay relationships. ""Obama politicizes deaths of AIDS researchers on Malaysian plane. We know how to stop AIDS: persuade men not to have sex with men,"" Fischer said in a message on Twitter that was retweeted 66 times and attracted national attention.  His comments were lambasted by writers of The Daily Beast, Salon and Patheos. Still, Fischer doubled down in another tweet and column. We wanted to dig into the facts behind his claim that the way to stop AIDS is to ""persuade men not to have sex with men."" Fischer’s evidence Experts say Fischer’s idea of an AIDS solution is highly flawed. But Fischer stood by his claim in an interview with PunditFact, citing a report from UNAIDS that the rate of HIV is 19 times higher among men who have sex with men than the adult population. Also, he said that while his tweet isolated on men having sex with men, he made a somewhat broader argument on his radio show.  ""We know how to stop the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Persuade men not to have sex with men,"" he said on his radio show Focal Point. ""Persuade prostitutes to go straight, and persuade people not to shoot up with drugs. If we can get everybody persuaded to do that, then the epidemic begins to diminish overnight."" Dr. Stefan Baral, a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health epidemiology professor and director of the Key Populations Program of the Center for Public Health and Human Rights, said Fischer’s post on Twitter reveals a misunderstanding about human nature and societal behavior. ""His recommendation is akin to making recommendations for people not to drive cars for fear of car accidents or riding a bike for fear of falling,"" Baral said in an email. ""In other words, this is a natural and healthy normal practice that in the context of an additional determinant induces risk. It would not be dissimilar from saying that there would be no cervical cancer if heterosexual people didn’t have sex."" HIV/AIDS overview There is no cure for AIDS or HIV, the virus that leads to AIDS and ravages the body’s immune system if untreated. The statistics are staggering. About 35 million people have HIV in the world, including about 3.3 million children and 1 million Americans, according to the Foundation for AIDS Research, or amfAR. Among Americans, about 50,000 are newly infected each year, and 18 percent do not know they have the virus. In 2012, 1.6 million people died from AIDS, which was a 30 percent drop from 2005, according to UNAIDS. In the United States, gay men contract the virus at disproportionate rates to their share of the American population. In 2010, men who have sex with men comprised 78 percent of new HIV infections among men -- 63 percent of all new infections -- even though they made up just 4 percent of the male American population, according to the CDC. Still, preventing men from having sex with men (if that were even feasible) will not end HIV/AIDS in the United States. About 20 percent of Americans infected with HIV in 2010 were women, mainly through heterosexual sex, according to the CDC. HIV is carried through body fluids. The virus is passed when HIV-infected fluids enter the bloodstream of someone else, such as through contact with a cut or sore, sharing needles or syringes, or through the vagina, rectum, mouth, or tip of the penis. In the United States, anal sex is the highest-risk behavior for spreading HIV, followed by vaginal sex, sex with multiple partners and sharing needles with someone infected with HIV. Mother-to-child transmissions are not common in the United States thanks to widespread HIV testing of pregnant women and drugs that prevent the virus from affecting a child. Neither is getting the virus through blood transfusions and organ donations and transplants, which are intensely tested for HIV. But what’s true for Americans is not true for other people in the world. World picture About 70 percent of all people infected with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa, about 24 million people. This region is also home to the most children living with HIV whose infections originated during pregnancy, childbirth of consuming breast milk, according to AIDS.gov. Globally, the dominant form of transmission is heterosexual sex, said Sophie Barton Knott, UNAIDS spokeswoman. Nearly half of people with HIV are female, and most were infected through heterosexual sex. Most of the 50.9 percent of men with HIV got it through heterosexual sex, too, she said. The highest rates of AIDS among 15- to 24-year-olds is among women in many parts of the world, said Seth Faison, spokesman for The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. And in Eastern Europe, the highest transmission rates of AIDS are among people who inject drugs. ""Men who have sex with men are a high-risk group, but not the only one,"" he said. The bottom line? Preventing men from having sex with men will not end AIDS. Faison said the criminalization of same-sex activity actually can increase transmission rates. Being gay is a crime in at least 76 countries, and in those places, gay men are less likely to receive treatment, testing and prevention. The CDC also says stigma and homophobia are likely one factor behind the rise in HIV infections among young gay men in the United States. ""In effect, efforts to ‘persuade men not to have sex with men’ is counterproductive,"" Faison said. ""It will not stop AIDS."" Our ruling Fischer said, ""We know how to stop AIDS: persuade men not to have sex with men."" Though men who have sex with men are at the highest risk of contracting HIV/AIDS in America, this is not a serious solution to ending a pandemic disease. Not in the United States, and certainly not worldwide. Women, children, and men who don’t have sex with men are also at risk, and women make up about half of people worldwide who have HIV/AIDS. Fischer’s claim is ridiculous. It rates Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/jul/30/bryan-fischer/american-family-association-radio-host-says-aids-c/

One in five single, childless adults in their early 20s not in school and don't work, Paul Ryan says

","Many of us know people in their early 20s, single with no kids, no longer in school. And not working. But just how common is that these days? On July 25, 2014, the day after he unveiled a new anti-poverty agenda, U.S. House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan did an interview with conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM (620) in Milwaukee. Sykes asked the Wisconsin Republican why conservatives shouldn’t be skeptical of one proposal in the plan, an expansion of the federal earned income tax credit, which allows lower- and moderate-wage workers to keep more of what they earn. Sykes said the credit can be viewed as ""income redistribution."" Ryan responded by saying the credit helps address ""these high disincentives of losing benefits on welfare if you go to work. The EITC helps pull people into work. It actually rewards work."" He added: ""When you look at society today, where we have probably the biggest problem with people going to work, it’s young, childless adults. It’s young people without kids, who are single, from 21 to 25 years old. Twenty percent of them in America are not working or even in school trying to find a job. And that is a real problem for society."" We figured the 20 percent figure might seem high to some readers, low to others. It turns out that, for a different, broader group of young people, that figure is in the ballpark. But there are no national statistics specifically for the group Ryan cited. ""Disconnected youths"" Concerns about Americans in their late teens and early 20s have been raised since at least 2007, when Congress held hearings on how they become detached from work and school. Two years later, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service did a report on ""disconnected youths."" It observed that those ages 16 to 24 who are not working nor in school ""may have difficulty gaining the skills and knowledge needed to attain self-sufficiency."" Since then, the concerns may have deepened. In 2013, the Congressional Research Service reported that from 2000 through 2010, people 16 to 24 ""experienced the steepest declines in employment."" And in a May 2014 report, the liberal Economic Policy Institute said that even as the unemployment rate for people under 25 was about double the overall rate, there was little evidence they have been able to ""shelter in school,"" given that college enrollment rates have dropped substantially since 2012. Ryan’s claim When we asked Ryan spokesman Kevin Seifert about Ryan’s 20 percent claim, he cited President Barack Obama’s own proposal, made in March 2014, to expand the earned income tax credit. A chart included in Obama’s proposal indicates that 19 percent of 21- to 24-year-olds are neither working nor in school. That appears to be close to the percentage Ryan cited -- except for two things. Ryan referred to 21- to 25-year-olds, while the Obama proposal referred to people ages 21 to 24. More importantly, Ryan spoke only of single and childless adults. Obama’s figure was for everyone in that age group, including those who are married. When we pointed out the differences to Seifert, he told us Ryan ""misspoke in relaying the specific statistic from the White House's report, but the larger point made in his remarks remains accurate -- that young Americans, the vast majority of which are single, are either unemployed or not in school and that's a problem."" The White House report didn’t cite a source for its 19 percent figure. But we found that according to the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, 19 percent of adults ages 20 to 24 -- a slightly different age group than was cited in the White House report -- were not enrolled in school and were not working in 2013. That figure includes all adults in that age group -- single and married, with or without kids. Both the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics told us there are no federal statistics for the group Ryan cited in terms of the percentage not in school and not working. Our rating Ryan said 20 percent of single adults without kids, ages 21 to 25, ""are not working or even in school trying to find a job."" The latest federal figures show that 19 percent of adults ages 20 to 24 weren’t in school and weren’t working in 2013. But that statistic is for a slightly different age range than what Ryan cited. And it includes everyone in that range, not just the single adults without kids that Ryan cited.   Since Ryan acknowledges he misstated the statistic, and there are no federal figures for the group he cited, we rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2014/jul/30/paul-ryan/one-five-single-childless-adults-their-early-20s-n/

Are 97 of the nation's 100 poorest counties in red states?
","A meme circulating on Twitter and other social media recently caught our eye. Created by the liberal group Occupy Democrats, it said, ""97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states. But tell me again how Republican policies grow the economy?"" This was a variation on a few memes we’ve checked previously -- that nine out of the 10 poorest states are red states (we rated this Mostly True) and that Republican-leaning states get more in federal dollars than they pay in taxes (also Mostly True). While the meme’s suggestion that ""Republican policies"" are causing poverty is too subjective a question to be fact-checked, we decided to take a closer look at the set-up to the claim -- that ""97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states."" First, we’ll explain our methodology. To determine the nation’s 100 poorest counties, we downloaded data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. This data covers five years ending in 2012, and includes more than 3,000 counties and county equivalents (such as Louisiana parishes). This data enabled us to rank-order these jurisdictions based on two commonly used measurements -- median income, and percentage of the population in poverty. As for determining whether a state is ""red"" or ""blue,"" we decided to define it by whether the state voted for President Barack Obama or Mitt Romney in 2012. This means we counted North Carolina and Indiana as red states, since Obama lost them in 2012 after winning them in 2008. (Though either way, the differences would have been marginal.) So how did the data turn out? For median income, we found that 95 of the 100 poorest counties were located in red states. Here are the 10 poorest, all of them in red states: 1. Owsley County, Ky. 2. Jefferson County, Miss. 3. Wolfe County, Ky. 4. Brooks County, Texas 5. McCreary County, Ky. 6. Hudspeth County, Texas 7. Hancock County, Tenn. 8. Jackson County, Ky. 9. Clay County, Ky. 10. Holmes County, Miss. For percentage of residents in poverty, we found that 93 of the 100 poorest counties were in red states. Here are the 10 with the highest poverty rates, all of them in red states: 1. Shannon County, S.D. 2. Clay County, Ga. 3. East Carroll Parish, La. 4. Sioux County, N.D. 5. Todd County, S.D. 6. Hudspeth County, Texas 7. Holmes County, Miss. 8. Corson County, S.D. 9. Wolfe County, Ky. 10. Humphreys County, Miss. So there are some differences between the most recent Census data and what the meme said, but they are pretty small. Numerically, we don’t have much to quibble with. Our bigger question concerns whether it’s significant that a lot of poor counties are located in red states. There’s reason for at least a bit of skepticism. For starters, the list is dominated by rural areas. Generally speaking, rural areas have a lower cost of living, so the small income you make in a poor, rural Texas county is going to go further than it would if you lived in a poor, urban area like Detroit or Camden, N.J. This raises questions about how comparatively disadvantaged poor Americans are in rural and urban areas. Also, rural areas are areas where Republicans tend to do well electorally. By contrast, impoverished areas of big cities are big enough population-wise to be balanced by more affluent neighborhoods, and these poor urban areas are often (though not always) in blue states. It’s also worth pointing out that many of the counties on the list are located in Appalachia, particularly in such states as Kentucky, West Virginia, Mississippi and Georgia. That’s a region that has suffered economically for generations -- long predating the time when Republicans took over from Democrats in most elected offices. In Appalachia, ""it’s clear there’s a regional problem, born of isolation, geographic and political; exploitation, of timber and coal; and poor education,"" said Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky. Finally, there’s an eccentricity that shaped both of the top-100 lists. Each is dominated by three states: Texas, Georgia and Kentucky. What ties together these three states? They have a lot of counties. In fact, these three states rank first, second and third on the list of states that have the most counties. Texas has 254, Georgia 159 and Kentucky 120. This means that these three states have lots of rural, small-population counties, so they take up a disproportionate share of the spots on these lists. On each list, these three states collectively account for more than 40 percent of the counties listed. Importantly, each of these three states are red states. If some of the bigger blue states had been sliced into as many counties as Texas, Georgia and Kentucky were, some of those blue-state counties might have been poor and rural, and that could have changed the complexion of the list. As it is, blue states tend to have smaller numbers of counties. New York has 62, California has 57, Washington state has 39, Oregon has 36, New Jersey has 21 and Massachusetts has just 14. Our ruling The meme said that ""97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states."" According to the most recent data, that’s a few percentage points high, but not by much. However, measuring a county’s lack of affluence this way skews the map of poorest places toward rural states (which tend to be red) and away from big cities (which tend to be blue). This undercuts the simplicity of the meme’s political message. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

Unsubstantiated: Greg Abbott attributes 3,000 murders to immigrants here illegally
","Greg Abbott, supportive of Gov. Rick Perry’s decision to place up to 1,000 National Guard troops near the Texas-Mexico border, declared the driving issue is public safety. Abbott, the Texas attorney general and 2014 Republican gubernatorial nominee, told Greta Van Susteren of Fox News that some of the ""worst of the worst"" criminals are coming across the Rio Grande. ""We’ve had women and children in the state of Texas who have been sexually assaulted by the people who have come across the border. We’ve had about 3,000 murders,"" Abbott said in the July 22, 2014 interview. ""It is a responsibility of a government to keep their people safe. The federal government has the responsibility of securing our border; they’re not doing it, so the state of Texas will do it."" His mention of 3,000 murders, brought to our attention by a reader, aligned with a more specific Perry claim we recently found factually unsupported and ridiculous. But Perry’s source for the figure, the Texas Department of Public Safety, hadn’t said that. By email, Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean told us the attorney general drew his murder count from the DPS web page, ""Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data,"" separately relied upon by Perry. A criminal alien is a non-citizen convicted of a crime. The DPS page states: ""From October 2008 through July 1, 2014, Texas has identified a total of 203,685 unique criminal alien defendants booked into Texas county jails. Over their criminal careers, these defendants are responsible for at least 642,564 individual criminal charges in Texas, mostly consisting of Class B misdemeanors or higher, including 3,070 homicides and 7,964 sexual assaults,"" the agency says. (After we started looking into Perry’s claim, the entry was tweaked to specify that all the charges occurred in Texas.) Homicide charges account for a sliver of all the criminal charges tabulated by the agency, according to a pie chart on the web page:  Source: Web page, ""Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data,"" Texas Department of Public Safety (accessed July 21, 2014) The last line on the page says ""these are minimum figures as these numbers include only those aliens whose fingerprints were already in the federal system when they were booked and it does not necessarily include all those who are incarcerated in federal prison."" We asked to interview the appropriate agency official about the figures on the web page. By email, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said: ""We don’t have any additional information to add to the website provided."" Outside criminologists In checking Perry’s claim, we’d asked criminologists recommended to us by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York how to interpret the DPS-presented information. Notably, the DPS web page doesn’t specify when the 3,070 homicide charges in the criminal histories of all the ""alien"" individuals arrested in Texas since October 2008 accumulated. By phone, Michael Walker, an adjunct John Jay professor and an expert in how the FBI gathers crime statistics, and Ramiro Martinez, Jr., a Northeastern University professor, each suggested it’s highly unlikely unauthorized residents committed that many homicides in recent years in Texas. Drawing on FBI Uniform Crime Statistics for Texas posted online by the DPS, Walker calculated that from 2008 through 2012, there were 3,903 persons arrested on homicide charges in the state. Walker said it’s not logical that residents in the state without legal permission accounted for most of the same deaths. He conceded, too, he wasn’t able to roll in homicide charges from 2013 and 2014; he didn’t see that data online nor were we successful in eliciting figures from DPS. Martinez offered up his own analysis, which started by averaging the FBI’s tally of a little more than 1,100 homicides in Texas in 2011 and 2012 and extrapolating that over six years to reach an estimated total of nearly 6,700 homicides over most of the period analyzed by DPS. By email, Martinez said that if one assumed unauthorized residents were responsible for 3,000 of all Texas homicides, that would hold them accountable for 46 percent of the estimated total. That, he said, ""makes no sense."" Martinez said in a follow-up email: ""It just boggles the imagination that level of ‘aliens’ were involved to that extent over time and nobody noticed."" The criminologists noted another weakness; the DPS presentation mixes recent homicide charges with those that might have been leveled decades ago. Also, they noted, the agency tallied arrests only, not homicide convictions. Martinez also raised an eyebrow at the mingling of criminal charges against legally authorized U.S. residents and individuals in the country without permission, risking conclusions irrelevant to border security today. By the state's approach, he said, it’s possible a homicide charge in the tally involves someone who reached the U.S. from Cuba in 1962 who was later charged with and/or committed a homicide. If so, he said, that charge would bear no relevance to criminal actions by people lately crossing the Rio Grande. Our ruling Abbott told Van Susteren ""we’ve had about 3,000 murders"" in connection with lax border security. This declaration, it turned out, isn’t substantiated by the cited state presentation which instead indicates 203,000-plus immigrants jailed in Texas in recent years had together accumulated 3,070 homicide charges (not convictions) in their lives. These individuals included people living here with legal permission and people here without authorization. Significantly, the presentation doesn’t show the homicides were committed by non-citizens living here without permission. Also, it’s silent on Abbott’s conclusion the immigrants charged with homicide all entered the country due to the border being easy to cross.

Tom Cotton says Mark Pryor 'continues to insist' that Obamacare is an 'amazing success'
","Tom Cotton says Mark Pryor is out-of-touch on a lot of things, especially health care. Cotton, the representative from Arkansas running for Senate, ties the incumbent Democrat’s vote for the Affordable Care Act to an unbridled loyalty to President Barack Obama and his party, rather than to Arkansas. In numerous ads, interviews and releases, the Cotton campaign has blasted his opponent’s support of the health care legislation, frequently bringing up that Pryor said the law has been an ""amazing success."" ""Sen. Pryor voted for Obamacare, and he continues to insist that it’s an 'amazing success,'"" a recent email to supporters said. Yes, Pryor voted for the Affordable Care Act in 2009, and he doesn’t shy away from that vote. But has he been such a valiant supporter throughout his campaign? First, we looked to see if and when Pryor first said the Affordable Care Act was an ""amazing success."" We found that the statement comes from comments Pryor made Aug. 6, 2013, during a visit to Mercy Hospital in Rogers, Ark. This was months before the rocky rollout of healthcare.gov, the Affordable Care Act online exchange. ""Well, I would say if you want a good opinion about Obamacare, go right here to Mercy Hospital and ask them how they feel about it. It’s been an amazing success story so far. Now the other side won’t ever tell you that. They won’t tell you all the good things that are working,"" he said to a local television reporter. We can’t be certain if he was saying the legislation was an ""amazing success"" overall, or if it was a success at Mercy Hospital, specifically, though his campaign says it was the latter. The same week he made those comments, he also said at a different event that Mercy Hospital added 100 new jobs because of the Affordable Care Act. A few months later, at an event with voters Dec. 4, an attendee asked Pryor whether he still believes the law was an ""amazing success,"" according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Pryor said he had made that comment immediately after meeting with hospital administrators who believed the health care law would benefit them because so many of their patients are poor. ""For a lot of hospitals, that is going to keep the doors open, and that is a success right there to try to keep the rural hospital doors open,"" he said at the event. Cotton’s campaign said Pryor ""continues to insist"" that the law has been an ""amazing success."" But looking through news reports, it seems that his August comments were the only time Pryor has used the phrase ""amazing success"" in conjunction with the Affordable Care Act. Throughout his campaign, Pryor has followed the pattern of other Senate Democrats running for re-election by saying he supports the Affordable Care Act, but there are still changes and improvements to be made. ""Let me say on the front end: The Affordable Care Act is far from perfect. We need to go in and reform it and fix it,"" he said on Aug. 8, the same week he made the ""amazing success"" comment. He has publicly held that stance as early as March 2010, when he released a statement discussing potential amendments to the law, and he has maintained it through recent months. This June, he told Politico that ""the law ‘isn’t perfect’ and that he would ‘work to make it better,’ but ‘something needed to be done’ to rein in the insurance industry."" Here are some of his other statements on the Affordable Care Act since the ""amazing success"" comment: Dec. 4, 2013 -- At the Political Animals Club in Little Rock, he said the law would be beneficial to Arkansas’ rural hospitals, according to Arkansas News Bureau. He said of the vote, ""I do remember that there were a lot of other things included in there. You run into this sometimes, where maybe you like one idea in something but they put a bunch of other stuff in there that makes it to where it’s something I couldn’t vote for."" Feb. 8, 2014 -- Pryor gave an interview to the Pine Bluff Commercial in which he said, ""With large pieces of legislation like this, if you get 80 percent of it right, then you are doing well,"" and that he would vote for the law again. April 14, 2014 -- KARK television asked Pryor if he would vote for the law again. ""You know, I would have,"" he said. ""Of course, I would want to see changes back then. But I think on something like this, it's big, it's complicated, it's difficult. If you get 80 percent of this right, you've really done something. We probably did get 80 percent of it right. We need to go back and really work on that other 20 percent and get it going in the right direction."" June 13, 2014 -- At the Delta Grassroots Caucus Conference, he said the law is not perfect, but he is working on ways to fix it. ""When I talk to my Republican friends about it I say, give me something better and I’ll vote for it,"" he said, according to Arkansas News Bureau. Our ruling The Cotton campaign said Pryor ""continues to insist"" that Obamacare is ""an amazing success."" We found that Pryor said the Affordable Care Act was an ""amazing success,"" but he was likely saying it was a success for a particular hospital he was visiting at the time. That comment came a year ago, and Pryor has not repeated it since. The comment also doesn’t fit with Pryor’s usual talking point -- that the law is not perfect, but it’s a step in the right direction. There’s some truth in Cotton’s claim, but it leaves out crucial context and distorts Pryor’s comments, so we rate this Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/jul/29/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-says-mark-pryor-continues-insist-obamac/

Joe Biden says Obama policies have cut minority dropout rate by 25 percent
","During a recent address in Las Vegas to the NAACP, Vice President Joe Biden touted the Obama administration’s role in helping students who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups. Calling the right to vote central to so many other human needs, Biden asked, ""How else, were it not the right of all those folks to vote, do you think we would have been able to expand Pell grants for 2.5 million more students? How else would we have put in place the educational policies that have reduced minority dropout rate by 25 percent?"" We wondered whether minority dropout rates have fallen by one-quarter during President Barack Obama’s tenure and, if so, whether it’s fair for the administration to take credit in a significant way. Before we look at the numbers, we should explain that there is more than one way to measure dropout frequency. One of the most common is the ""status dropout rate,"" which measures, at a specific point in time, what percent of people within a certain age range are dropouts. The other measurement is called the ""event dropout rate."" This measures what percentage of people in an age range dropped out during the prior year. The different methods can lead to different figures. In addition, we should note that the data is not entirely up to date. The Education Department has released data on the status dropout rate through 2012, and on the event dropout rate for two specific years, 2008 and 2011. We’ll use the most recent data, but it isn’t a perfect fit for studying the entire Obama era. Using the status dropout rate, Biden is right on the numbers. For African-Americans between the ages of 16 and 24, the status dropout rate declined from 9.9 percent in 2008 to 7.5 percent in 2012. That’s a 24 percent decrease -- very close to what Biden said. For Hispanics, the rate declined from 18.3 percent to 12.7 percent over the same period -- a decrease of 31 percent, which is well above what Biden claimed. The data is somewhat more mixed if you look at the event dropout rate for 15-to-24 year-olds. Between 2008 and 2011, the dropout rate for African-Americans fell from 6.1 percent to 3.8 percent, or a decrease of 38 percent. For Hispanics, however, the decrease was smaller than the 25 percent Biden cited -- the rate fell from 4.9 percent to 4.1 percent, or a decline of 16 percent. So on the numbers, Biden isn’t perfect, but he’s pretty close. What about whether the administration deserves credit for the decline? On an Education Department Web page, the administration cites a number of policies it credits for reducing the dropout rate.   The list includes competitive funds such as the Race to the Top, Promise Neighborhoods, and Investing in Innovation programs; an initiative that give states more flexibility to target schools most needing improvement; and programs like Ladders of Opportunity and Promise Zones that provide federal assistance to ""communities of concentrated poverty."" The administration says it has committed $6.2 billion to School Improvement Grants focused on roughly 2,000 persistently low-achieving schools, ""which produce a disproportionate number of the more than 500,000 students who drop out of high school each year."" Education experts we contacted said such efforts may well have made a difference. But they added that there’s a long list of factors that likely played a role as well. ""While the educational policies put in place by the Obama administration have played their role in addressing the dropout crisis, it would be unfair to attribute the recent decreases in minority dropout rates solely to them,"" said Jennifer DePaoli, education advisor at Civic Enterprises, a research group that studies education. Here’s a rundown of the other factors that likely influenced the decline in dropout rates, according to experts: Policies instituted by George W. Bush President George W. Bush spearheaded and signed the No Child Left Behind Act, and there’s evidence that it has had an impact on dropout rates. While the decline in dropout rates has accelerated under Obama, the decline actually began under Bush. Between 2000 and 2008, status dropout rates fell by 24 percent for African-Americans and by 34 percent for Hispanics -- significant decreases on their own, even before Obama took office. Changes in policy ""can take a while to trickle down, and we might be seeing a delayed and ongoing effect of policies from several years earlier,"" said Christopher Swanson, vice president of Editorial Projects in Education, which publishes Education Week. ""If you look at the overall trend, things have been moving in the right direction for a while."" State policies matter, too -- not just federal policies Not only can states pass their own education laws, but they often have some discretion in shaping how federal education policies take effect within their borders. ""If Biden is right that national policies are driving things, you wouldn’t get a lot of state-level differences in dropout trends,"" said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education. ""But in fact there are differences.""   Indeed, a study by Civic Enterprises, America’s Promise Alliance, the Alliance for Excellent Education and the Everyone Graduates Center at John Hopkins University found quite a bit of variation. Twenty states recorded annual gains of at least one percentage point in graduation rates between 2006 and 2010, the report found, while nine states saw flat or declining graduation rates over the same period. In fact, one problem with trusting the statistics too much is that the state numbers may be subject to bureaucratic hijinks, said Julian Vasquez Heilig, a University of Texas professor of educational policy and planning. In Texas, for instance, there’s been skepticism about the validity of statistics showing large shifts in the number of students going from in-school to home-school status. Home-schooled students, as it happens, don’t count in dropout calculations. ""Only politicians believe that the dropout rate has gone down,"" Heilig said. ""Ask any educator in an urban schools and they will tell you otherwise. Essentially, we find ways to define away students."" A poor economy can keep more kids in school One of the perverse impacts of a weak economy is that it may lead to lower dropout rates. During a strong economic period, slack labor markets may lure teens away from school through job offers and higher wages. But during weaker economic periods, someone who drops out of school would face few employment options. That might be enough to keep a lid on the dropout rate. ""Kids are more likely to stay in school when there are no job opportunities,"" Bills said. ""I think economics generally trumps policy."" Broader demographic factors can drive dropout trends, too Richard Murnane, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, cites several trends beyond the Great Recession that may have helped lower the dropout rate over the last decade or so. One is a decline in the teenage birthrate, which means that fewer high-school girls are dropping out to take care of a newborn. Another is a decline in arrests of teenagers for violent crimes, reducing another reason for dropping out. And a third is an increase in the number of children attending preschool -- a predictor of future academic success, especially for low-income boys, Murnane said. ""There’s no causal evidence that can tell you the relative importance of these factors in explaining the trends"" in dropout rates, Murnane said. In all, then, these experts don’t doubt that there’s been some impact from Obama administration policies, but they add that there are many bigger forces that can claim a share of the credit for lowering dropout rates. ""It would be nearly impossible to point to any specific federal policies put in place by the Obama administration -- or the Bush administration, for that matter -- that have been directly responsible for the decrease in dropout rates and the increase in graduation rates for minority students,"" DePaoli said. Our ruling Biden said Obama administration policies ""have reduced minority dropout rate by 25 percent."" He’s very close on the numbers, and the administration can take some credit for the decline. But a lot of other factors likely played a role, from Bush-era policies to state-level action to larger forces such as the weak economy, falling teen birth rates and rising preschool enrollment.

Limbaugh: U.S. leads the world in climate doubt
","After a 26-year crusade against ""environmentalist wackos,"" Rush Limbaugh has emerged triumphant, according to the conservative radio host himself. Citing recent findings by market researchers Ipsos MORI, Limbaugh said on his July 22, 2014, radio show that the United States leads the pack in questioning climate change, and he’s taking all the credit. ""Fifty-four percent of Americans agreed with the statement, 'The climate change we are currently seeing is largely the result of human activity,’ "" he said. ""Why would the U.S. be the leading nation with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change? Why do you think that would be?  I think that's exactly right: Me. There's just no other explanation"" Whether Limbaugh is giving praise where praise is due, we can’t know for sure. But we did want to check out his claim that America leads in climate change skepticism. Global lukewarming We’ll start with Limbaugh’s source. In its first-ever Global Trends Survey, Ipsos MORI used an online poll to survey roughly 32,000 adults in 20 countries (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Great Britain, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United States.) Respondents were asked about their attitudes on climate change. The countries were then ranked by the percentage who agreed with the statement. Here’s how the U.S. fared:   Statement Agree Disagree Ranking The climate change we are currently seeing is largely the result of human activity  54% 32% 20 We’re headed for environmental disaster unless we change our habits quickly.  57.3% 31.5% 20 The climate change we are currently seeing is a natural phenomenon that happens from time to time 52% 35% 1(tie) I’m tired of the fuss made about the environment. 36% 54% 7 Companies do not pay enough attention to the environment 65% 22% 19 I try to recycle as much as I can. 76% 18% 14 Even the scientists don’t really know what they’re talking about when on environmental issues.  43% 43% 13 The government is just using environmental issues to raise taxes. 50% 35% 17   Based on the results, the United States had the lowest percentage of people say that climate change is: 1. Largely man-made, and 2. Leading the world toward environmental ruin. The United States also tied India for the highest percentage of people agree that climate change is a natural phenomenon that happens from time to time, though more Americans disagreed with the statement than Indians. All of that gives Limbaugh’s claim credence, though there are a couple of caveats. Ipsos MORI research director Bobby Duffy said Limbaugh’s conclusion that the United States is the most skeptical country is ""probably too simple."" While the numbers indicate that the United States is the least likely nation among those surveyed to see climate change as a man-made issue, the majority of Americans -- albeit, not by a huge margin -- still believe that climate change is anthropogenic. Moreover, Americans aren’t scoffing at the general idea of climate change. The United States ranked near the middle of the nations when asked if there is too much of a fuss made about the environment. And Americans recycle at average rates -- though Duffy noted recycling could be motivated by other concerns such as use of resources and socialization. Hockey stick gaffes The survey itself is somewhat limited. While more than 1,000 people were surveyed in some countries including the United States, other countries such as Argentina, Belgium, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Sweden and Turkey included around 500 individuals. Duffy explained that this was due to client interest in the those markets, as Ipsos MORI is a market researcher. Who was surveyed is also important. Ipsos MORI said the survey was representative of the general adult population in ""developed"" (shorthand for greater Internet access) nations such as the United States. But in developing nations, Ispos said it surveyed a ""more affluent and ‘connected’ population"" to represent an emerging middle class, according to Duffy. To some pollsters, this method of surveying is problematic. It doesn’t make sense to compare the elites of one country to the general population of another, said University of Maryland public policy researcher Steven Kull. ""If you’re looking at public opinion in a country, look at the country. If you want to look at a subset, look at a subset. Otherwise it’s apples to oranges,"" he said.   Still, Ipsos’ findings are fairly consistent with the most recent Pew Research Center survey -- where 67 percent of Americans said that there is solid evidence of global warming, and 44 percent say it’s mostly due to human activity. A separate Pew Global poll found that when stacked up against 22 other countries, the United States was one of the least concerned about global warming, right under China and Britain and outranking only Poland and Pakistan. (Interestingly, Ipsos found that 91 percent of people in China said the world was heading for an environmental disaster unless we change our habits. Duffy said this can be explained again by the sampling approach and mode of interview.) One of the most comprehensive polls we found was Gallup’s 2010 survey of 111 countries. Though nearly all Americans were aware of global warming, 47 percent -- the largest percentage in the world -- said it was due to solely natural causes. About half said global warming was at least partly anthropogenic, a 12-percentage-point drop since the last Gallup poll in 2008. That’s slightly below the world’s average but far below the rates in developed countries.  Lower percentages of belief in human-caused climate change in developing nations make sense, given correspondingly lower rates of awareness, education and literacy, said Riley Dunlap, an environmental sociologist at Oklahoma State University. But in the United States, it’s politics that is causing the skepticism. The ruling Limbaugh said that the United States is ""the leading nation with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change."" While he cites an exact figure reported by Ipsos MORI, the study itself doesn’t capture the belief of general populations, only those with an Internet connection. Other polls we looked at indicate that a good proportion of developing countries have higher rates of doubt. But among peers, the United States is one of the most -- if not, the most -- skeptical when it comes to believing climate change has human factors.

Does an active father makes children 98% more likely to graduate from college?
","In defending traditional marriage, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in a speech about values at Catholic University that fathers play a vital role in their children’s success. Rubio cited statistics about the number of children born to unwed mothers and what that means for their chances to climb out of poverty and go to college. After getting an education, finding a good job and getting married, ""The final element of the success sequence is raising children in a married, two-parent home,"" Rubio said July 23, 2014. ""Even in my own family, of course, I have examples of children raised by one parent who have gone on to successful lives. But we also know that having an active father makes children 98 percent more likely to graduate from college and complete the first step of the success sequence."" We decided to fact-check the 98 percent statistic. Study of teenagers A spokeswoman for Rubio pointed to a research brief about the role of fathers in college success by Bradford Wilcox, a sociologist and director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia. The brief was published by the conservative American Enterprise Institute where Wilcox is a visiting scholar. Wilcox used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a respected study of a representative sample of teenagers in grades 7–12 during the 1994–95 school year. The survey asked teenagers 11 questions about activities they did with their dads -- for example, whether they received homework help from them. He found that by looking at the answers, Wilcox categorized 18 percent as having fathers who were not involved. For the remainder, he divided the fathers into three groups: somewhat involved, involved, or highly involved fathers. ""Compared to teens who reported that their fathers were not involved, teens with involved fathers were 98 percent more likely to graduate from college...,"" Wilcox wrote. Wilcox also found that involved fathers played more of a role in their children completing college if those children had mothers who completed at least high school or college. He found that only 15 percent of teens with a high-school educated mom and an uninvolved dad graduated from college, compared to 30 percent of teens with an involved dad and a high-school educated mom. Wilcox’s research wasn’t exclusively about married, biological or straight fathers; it looked at all fathers regardless of their marital status or if they lived with their children or sexual orientation. However Wilcox found that, ""adolescents are much more likely to report an involved or highly involved father if their biological parents are married."" Other experts weigh in We interviewed seven experts about Wilcox’s research and Rubio’s statement. Wilcox’s findings align with social conservatives, which opens him up to some scrutiny from the left. That said, the experts we interviewed raised several nonpartisan points about Wilcox’s findings. Professors noted that Wilcox’s research brief doesn’t carry the same weight as a peer-reviewed journal article. Also, they argued that Wilcox didn’t prove that fathers’ involvement caused their children to complete college -- instead he showed a correlation. Ohio State University sociologist Kristi Williams told PolitiFact that Rubio’s claim that having an active father ""makes"" children 98 percent more likely to graduate from college ""implies a causality that Professor Wilcox's study does not establish. (He) shows a correlation but does not establish this causality."" When we told Wilcox that professors raised concerns about causation, he pointed us to a paper written by other researchers in the Annual Review of Sociology about the causal effects of father absence. But that paper indicated there were studies that showed more of an effect on high school graduation. ""There was weak evidence for effects on college attendance and graduation, with only one of four studies finding significant results,"" the paper said. Lots of studies show that father involvement is helpful only when the fathers are competent parents and maintain a good relation to the mom, married or not, said Stephanie Coontz, director of research and public education at the Council on Contemporary Families and an Evergreen State College professor. ""Still, other research suggests that a better predictor of kids’ educational achievement than family structure is the mother’s education and educational aspirations for her children,"" Coontz told PolitiFact. ""Which suggests we might want to prioritize upping that, instead of trying to marry such women off to low-income men whose chronic economic stress and insecurity very often erodes their functioning as partners and parents."" The experts we interviewed didn’t dispute the concept that active fathers could play a role in their children completing college. However, they said there can be additional factors at play, especially income. ""Kids from well-off families don’t have to combine work and study to the degree that poorer kids do,"" George Washington University professor Michael Wiseman said. ""The question for Sen. Rubio should be, ‘Exactly what policies do you recommend for encouraging fathers to commit to their families and to marry the mother of their children?’ Talk about fatherhood is cheap. Ideas seem to be in short supply."" Our ruling Rubio said, ""Having an active father makes children 98 percent more likely to graduate from college."" Rubio was citing a research brief that looked at a survey of 11 different measures of fathers’ involvement with their children and whether the children graduated from college. But when Rubio used the word ""makes"" he implied that having an active father causes their children to graduate from college, and the research doesn’t prove causation. Other researchers said there could be other reasons for the disparities in college graduation. Rubio’s statement requires further explanation and relies on one piece of research only.

Chris Moews says Clarke decision on lakefront patrols cost $370,000 after lawsuit
","Milwaukee County Sheriff’s candidate Chris Moews claims incumbent Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr.  compromised public safety and cost taxpayers $370,000 in a single decision. The decision: To have corrections officers patrol the lakefront. Moews, a Milwaukee Police lieutenant, made the claim in an interview July 14, 2014 on WUWM. Moews framed it as an example of mismanagement by Clarke, who he faces in the Democratic primary August 12, 2014. ""One example of that is when he sent unarmed and untrained corrections officers down to the lakefront and out to our park-and-rides to patrol, last summer,"" Moews said. ""A lawsuit was filed and the taxpayers had to write a check for $370,000 because of that single, poor management decision by the sheriff."" There are many layers to this claim. So, let’s peel them apart. First, the $370,000 settlement that Moews referred to came in 2013. Why are we just hearing about it now? Turns out it was kept quiet -- at the county’s insistence. As part of the settlement, the Milwaukee County Deputy Sheriffs’ Association -- long at odds with Clarke -- promised not to publicize the settlement. Meanwhile, the matter did not go to the County Board. And Clarke said he had never seen the final settlement agreement and was surprised to learn, from PolitiFact Wisconsin, about its details. That said, the bottom line on Moew’s claim is that he’s got his facts jumbled. While the sheriff’s use of corrections officers cost taxpayers $370,000, Moews conflated two complaints that the deputies’ union brought against Clarke. Back to the beginning In 2004, Clarke started replacing deputies with corrections officers at the jail and House of Correction in an effort to save money. The corrections officers are paid less than deputies, are not sworn or armed and don’t have arrest powers. In June 2010, Clarke offered the corrections officers overtime shifts working crowd control for the the July 3 fireworks at the lakefront and at park-and-ride lots during Summerfest. The officers -- unarmed but in uniform -- were told to be on the lookout for troublemakers and alert dispatchers if they saw a problem. In the weeks that followed, the deputies’ union filed two unfair labor practice complaints with the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission. The complaints, which were later combined, said Clarke gave work that had been previously been done by deputies to the corrections officers. Hearing examiner Stuart Levitan ruled in favor of the union in October of 2011. He ordered Clarke to bargain with the deputies union over the use of the corrections officers for the overtime duty. ""Sheriff Clarke made a conscious decision to provide a lower level of public safety in exchange for cost savings,"" Levitan wrote in his decision. The practice of using corrections officers exclusively for the patrols ended with the case, said Mark Grady, deputy corporation counsel for the county. The other case It was an entirely different case that included the $370,000 settlement. In March of 2011, the deputies’ union filed complaint that said starting in January of that year, Clarke offered overtime at the jail and House of Correction only to the lower paid corrections officers. That led to arbitration before a state hearing examiner in 2012. In May of 2012, hearing examiner Raleigh Jones sided with the union. Jones said the decision to limit overtime -- estimated at 400 hours in one month, January 2011 -- violated the union contract. He ordered the county to reinstate the previous voluntary overtime practice, and directed the county and union to determine how much back pay the deputies deserved to cover lost overtime opportunities. The county and union settled the case with an agreement inked May 7, 2013. That agreement called for the county to pay the union $370,000 in wages, with the union determining who received the money. It was one of the largest arbitration settlements ever, according to union president Roy Felber. In addition, two unrelated discipline cases were resolved in that settlement. A 60-day suspension of one deputy was dropped to 10 days and a five-day suspension of another was reduced to one day. The settlement including this line: ""The MDSA President Roy M. Felber further agrees not to contact the media regarding the terms of this agreement. The members of the MDSA shall only discuss the contents of this agreement as necessary."" Felber said he gave Moews the bad information. ""I mixed up the two cases,"" he said. ""The principle is the same. The cases are different."" Moews campaign manager Sachin Chheda acknowledged the jumbled information. ""Chris does regret the error, but stands by the general thrust of his remark, that mismanagement by the sheriff is costing taxpayers unnecessarily,"" he said. Payments to settle matters such as grievances do not go to the County Board. ""Corporation Counsel handles litigation, and details of this case were never shared."" said Bill Zaferos, spokesman for the County Board. On that point, Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele and the comptroller’s office disagree. ""The County Board was provided an informational update as to what happened in this matter over a couple of meeting cycles in mid 2013,"" said Steve Cady, policy and research director in the county comptroller’s office. Clarke’s view Clarke said he was unaware of the terms of the $370,000 settlement agreement. He said he didn’t know that it called for the reduced punishment for the two deputies, and didn’t know about the secrecy provision. ""I welcome this being made public,"" he said.   Clarke said the cases stem from his efforts to save money. He said that virtually all staffing at the jail is provided by corrections officers, and not deputies and that, until the grievance was filed, no deputies had sought overtime at the jail. ""I think they (the union) exploited an opportunity,"" Clarke said. Clarke noted the deputies union initially sought $1.3 million -- the amount in overtime that had been paid to the corrections officers.   Although the county paid $370,000 to settle the case, Clarke said: ""I still saved taxpayers $1 million,"" by staffing jail overtime with the civilians. The sheriff said he urged the corporation counsel’s office to appeal the 2012 decision in the overtime case but they chose not to. The county and union then went about the business of hammering out the details of a settlement, a process that took more than a year. Inspector Edward Bailey, part of the Sheriff’s Department command staff, said he participated in early settlement discussions that included the union, arbitrator and county lawyers. ""(The) $370,000 was unacceptable to this office, but they overruled us,"" Bailey said of the county’s lawyers. Both Clarke and Bailey said the gag order on the union included in the agreement did not come from them. Felber agreed: ""That was (from) the county’s attorneys. I don’t think they wanted that amount to get out there."" Our rating Moews claimed that taxpayers shelled out $370,000 because Clarke switched from deputies to lower paid corrections officers for lakefront and park and ride lot patrols. He got some of his facts and dates wrong, but the gist of his claim is correct. The union filed and won two complaints regarding the move to corrections officers, and county taxpayers paid $370,000 to settle one of them.

Deal wrong, Axelrod not working for Carter

","Gov. Nathan Deal was on radio recently to address allegations that two of his aides pressured the director of the state ethics commission to settle cases against his campaign. WSB radio’s Erick Erickson asked the governor what he thought of Democratic opponent Jason Carter’s call for an independent investigation. Deal said it wasn’t surprising ""now that Carter has gotten David Axelrod to come down and be his campaign advisor."" Axelrod, a longtime political strategist, is closely tied to President Barack Obama. He was campaign manager when Obama won the presidency in 2008 and followed Obama to Washington to serve as White House senior advisor. He left the administration in 2011 to become senior strategist for Obama’s successful 2012 re-election campaign. Deal is hardly the first candidate in this year’s elections to try to link an opponent to Obama, who has a low 42-percent job approval rating nationally, worse in Georgia. In the state’s GOP Senate race, for example, U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston tried to tar opponent David Perdue by pointing out that a company with Perdue on its board of directors had accepted money from Obama’s stimulus program. Perdue, meanwhile, attacked Kingston for voting to put money into president’s Cash for Clunkers program. But in this case, Deal got it wrong. Axelrod isn’t working on Carter’s campaign. He’s running the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago. But AKPD Message and Media, a political consulting firm that Axelrod founded and sold in 2009, is working for Carter, a two-term state senator and the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter who was born in Georgia but grew up outside of Chicago. AKPD is doing media consulting for Carter’s campaign for governor and, as of the last disclosure reports, had been paid $67,908. The Chicago firm boasts of a successful track record for Democratic candidates. Jen Talaber, spokeswoman for Deal’s re-election bid, said the campaign wasn’t aware Axelrod had sold the firm five years ago. It was an ""honest mistake,"" she said an email. But Talaber said the governor’s underlying point still stands. ""Carter’s campaign team and consultants are Obama insiders, and his national fundraising list shows the Obama brain trust is in full force,"" she said. Bryan Thomas, communications director for the Carter campaign, said Deal’s claim about Axelrod ""was no slip of the tongue. ""Gov. Deal will do anything he can to distract from his ethical quagmire, including lie about his opponent,"" Thomas said. ""It's not surprising that a governor who plays it so loose with the laws is playing loose with truth, too."" Earlier this month, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution obtained a memo in which Holly LaBerge, head of the state ethics commission, said she was threatened and pressured by Deal’s office in 2012 to ""make (ethics) complaints"" against the governor ""go away."" The complaints included claims Deal improperly paid for use of a private aircraft for campaign travel and questioned his use of campaign funds to pay legal fees during his 2010 campaign. The ethics commission wound up dismissing the major complaints against Deal. He agreed to pay $3,350 in fees for technical defects to his campaign disclosures. Now, the Deal campaign isn’t the only one spreading word of an Axelrod connection. The Georgia Republican Party has a web page on ""Chicago liberals,"" with images of Carter, Axelrod and Obama. It states: ""Sadly, Chicago-style politics have come to Georgia. Atlanta liberal Jason Carter has hired Barack Obama’s trusted ally, David Axelrod."" It goes on to say: ""Liberals know they can’t hit Gov. Deal on jobs, the economy, or education. So they’ve resorted to attacking Gov. Deal’s character … Tell Jason Carter, Barack Obama, and David Axelrod we don’t need Chicago liberals running around Georgia attacking our conservative values. AKPD’s website touts the firm’s founding by Axelrod and has a quote from him on its homepage. We reached out to firm executives just to ask point blank if Axelrod were in someway connected to them or the Carter campaign. We heard back from Isaac Baker, a partner in the firm,  who said Axelrod ""does not work for our firm"" and ""is not involved in any way in the Jason Carter campaign."" To summarize, David Axelrod is not working as a campaign advisor to Jason Carter. But the firm he founded and sold five years ago is. Talaber, Deal’s campaign spokeswoman, said the governor made an ""honest mistake"" when he said in a radio interview that Axelrod was working for Carter. But she said the underlying point still stands -- that Carter’s campaign team and consultants are ""Obama insiders."" That doesn’t change the fact that the governor was incorrect in saying that Jason Carter has ""gotten David Axelrod to come down and be his campaign advisor.""

Jeb Bush says 2 percent of children apprehended at border in 2014 were returned
","Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, one of the Republican Party’s most vocal advocates of federal action on immigration policy, recently re-entered the immigration debate with an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal regarding the thousands of undocumented Central American minors flocking to the United States border. Bush, a potential 2016 candidate, co-authored the op-ed with Clint Bolick, the vice president for litigation at the libertarian Goldwater Institute (the two also teamed up for a book on immigration in 2013). Before laying out their suggested course of action, Bush and Bolick explain the problem. ""Currently the vast number of children is overwhelming the process,"" they wrote. ""Roughly half do not show up for their hearings. As a result, judging by Homeland Security figures, only a fraction of the approximately 20,000 Central American children who entered the country illegally in 2013 were repatriated. By some estimates, as few as 2 percent of the 50,000 children who have crossed the border illegally this year have been sent home."" We’ve already looked at the number of minors who report for their hearings. (Bush's description of it as ""roughly half"" is not far off from what we found.) But what about the number of children that the government has returned this year? We decided to look into the stat. Where did 2 percent come from? Right off the bat, we’ll note that these numbers are hard to pin down. This particular immigration issue crosses multiple government agencies — the Justice Department, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, among others. Each one we contacted sent us toward a different department or agency to find the number. The bureaucratic labyrinth ultimately gave us no answer. So where did Bush get this 2 percent figure? A spokeswoman told PolitiFact that it came from a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing meeting on July 9, where many of the aforementioned bureaucracies testified. During the hearing, R. Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said since the start of Fiscal Year 2014 (which begins in October 2013), about 57,000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., then asked: ""Of those 57,000, how many have been returned?"" Kerlikowske said he didn’t know because his agency only deals with ""apprehension."" ""Okay, so who would know?"" Johnson asked the panel. ""Who'd know the number of how many of those have been returned?"" ""The numbers I have that we talked about, about 1,300, 1,500,"" said Thomas Winkowski, the principal deputy assistant secretary for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. If you do the math, 1,300 to 1,500 out of 57,000 is about 2 or 3 percent. So Bush seems to be right. But the numbers get a bit more complicated than that. In his op-ed (and his office confirmed) Bush was discussing a specific issue: the number of children from Central American countries showing up at the border. Due to a 2008 immigration law, Mexican children are processed differently than those coming from non-border countries. It’s the surge in Central American children that make up the ongoing border crisis. Once apprehended at the border, minors from Central America are screened for trafficking or other signs of abuse. Immigration and Customs officials issue a ""notice of removal"" that begins the legal proceedings to determine whether the child must be deported. In the meantime, the law instructs the child to be placed with a family member or sponsor, if possible. Immigration courts then determine whether a child is eligible for asylum or specialized visas for victims of trafficking, but that process can take years. Mexican children, meanwhile, can just be turned around at the border by U.S. authorities. The 57,000 figure includes children from Mexico, who make up about 12,600 of the apprehended minors. When you subtract the Mexican children from the three main Central American countries — El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — you get about 44,000. From the testimony, it’s also not clear how many of the 1,300 to 1,500 returned are from Mexico and how many are from Central America. Bush’s office sent us to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. McCain’s staff told us that Immigration and Customs Enforcement said to them that 890 of the apprehended children from Central America in 2014 have been returned, but they could not forward us that correspondence and the agency would not confirm it independently. For what it’s worth, 890 is 2 percent of 44,000. A study released July 28 (after Bush’s op-ed was released) also seemed to back up the general figure. The Bipartisan Policy Center found about 18,300 cases in 2014 of juveniles from Central America entering the system (meaning, not just apprehended but beginning the legal procedures). Through June 2014, 393 have been ordered for removal and 62 left voluntarily. Together, that’s about 2.4 percent of all cases. (The data comes from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering service of Syracuse University, not a federal agency.) Why so low? According to the Bipartisan Policy Center study, 95 percent of the 2014 cases are still pending. A big reason why only 2 percent have been removed is because so few cases have made it to a hearing a yet — not because they failed to show up to a court hearing, like Bush wrote. Compare that to previous years. About 70 percent of the 2013 cases are still pending. Still, in about 15 percent of cases the minor was ordered to return to Central America or left the United States voluntarily.  In 2012, more than a quarter of all cases resulted in removal orders; in 2011, it was one-third. In an example of how arduous this process can be, 8 percent of 2009 cases are still pending, the study found. Experts we spoke with said the legal proceedings can take two to three years. Why does it take so long? Previously, cases involving undocumented minors took a back seat in the court system to immigration cases involving apprehended adults. The Obama administration has taken steps to make these cases involving Central American children a priority, but immigration courts are notoriously overworked and the influx of new cases in the past 12 months has exasperated the issue, further slowing the process. Our ruling Bush wrote, ""As few as 2 percent of the 50,000 (Central American) children who have crossed the border illegally this year have been sent home."" It’s surprisingly difficult to track down exact numbers, but from what we can gather, that number appears accurate. That figure, though, is only useful as a snapshot of the current state of affairs; it is likely the number will rise as more and more of these children go through the legal process. Further, Bush said the low number was a result of Central American children skipping their court appearances. Actually, it has more to do with how long the legal proceedings take. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jul/28/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-2-percent-children-apprehended-borde/

Rob Astorino, GOP challenger to Andrew Cuomo, says New York had worst recovery from recession
","Rob Astorino, the county executive of New York’s Westchester County, is the expected Republican nominee for governor this fall, facing the uphill challenge of unseating Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has led several recent polls by about 30 points. On July 25, 2014, Astorino appeared on Fox & Friends to tout his candidacy. Among other things, Astorino attacked his opponent’s economic record. ""This is an uphill, but winnable race in New York,"" Astorino said. ""... And we are worst in the nation in economic recovery, in outlook, in business climate, highest taxes, most corruption. We had 400,000 New Yorkers leave our state in three and a half years. So it is bad in New York, but it can get better beginning in January with a new governor."" We decided to check whether Astorino was correct that New York is ""worst in the nation in economic recovery."" We looked at four widely used economic measures to see whether New York was really a bottom-dweller. We didn’t find the state at the bottom on any of them. Job growth New York ranked 17th in the nation in the percentage increase in jobs between June 2009 (the official end of the most recent recession) and June 2014 (the most recent month for which data is available), according to an Associated Press calculation of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Payroll employment in New York increased from 8.5 million to 9 million over that period -- a 6 percent jump, or exactly in line with the percentage for the United States as a whole. Current unemployment rate This statistic isn’t as favorable to New York, but the state isn’t dead last, either. Currently, New York’s unemployment rate is 6.6 percent, tied for the 36th best in the country, or roughly in the bottom quarter of states. That’s a bit worse than the national average of 6.1 percent. Decrease in the unemployment rate It’s much the same if you look at how far the state unemployment rate has fallen since June 2009. In New York, the unemployment rate has fallen by 1.9 percentage points, or tied for the 34th biggest drop among the 50 states over that period. Nationally, the drop in unemployment since June 2009 has been bigger than New York’s -- 3.4 percentage points for the nation as a whole. Inflation-adjusted growth in gross domestic product This statistic measures how much growth there’s been in a state’s total economic activity, accounting for inflation. New York’s GDP grew by 7 percent between June 2009 and June 2014, which ranked as the 30th biggest jump among the 50 states. This means that New York grew a bit more slowly than the nation as a whole over the same period; the national increase was about 9 percent. If you put it all together, these figures suggest that New York’s bounceback from the Great Recession has been below average compared to the other 49 states. But we see no support for calling New York’s economic performance ""worst in the nation."" The weakest of the statistics we looked at shows New York in the bottom quarter of states, while the best of the four we checked shows New York ranking well above average. When contacted by PolitiFact, a spokesman for Astorino's campaign said Astorino ""misspoke."" He had intended to say that upstate New York is ranked last in recovery -- not the whole state. There's certainly evidence that upstate New York is struggling -- for instance, Moody's has cited data that ""indicate a stalling economic recovery in upstate New York""-- but given the available statistics, it's hard to do a national, apples-to-apples comparison to determine what region is faring the worst in the recovery. For the record, New Mexico had the weakest increase in jobs in the nation as well as the smallest decline in the unemployment rate, while Rhode Island and Mississippi tied for the worst current unemployment rate and Maine and Connecticut saw the smallest increase in inflation-adjusted state GDP. Our ruling Astorino said that New York state is the ""worst in the nation in economic recovery."" His staff now acknowledges that the candidate misspoke. He did have a point that several commonly used statistics suggest that New York’s recovery has been weaker than average among the 50 states. But that’s a far cry from ""worst in the nation."" We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2014/jul/28/rob-astorino/rob-astorino-gop-challenger-andrew-cuomo-says-ny-h/

Are states without an income tax doing 'better' than ones that do?
","Bill Maher used the latest jobs numbers out of Kansas as an occasion for his ""Zombie Lies"" segment about what he calls ""lies that Republicans tell that you can debunk, but they do not go away."" One such ""zombie lie,"" Maher said, is ""trickle-down economics, the idea that you cut taxes for rich people and then the job creators get job creating and then the economy just blooms."" The latest nail in Maher’s zombie coffin is the ""revenue collapse"" Kansas is facing after its Legislature passed 25 percent cuts to individual tax rates in 2012. Jamie Weinstein, senior editor for the Daily Caller, came to the defense of the supply-siders. ""It’s too early to make a declarative judgment"" on Kansas’ tax cuts, Weinstein said. ""There’s been studies of nine states that have no income state tax versus nine states with the highest state income tax. Which do you think have done better? It’s not the states with the highest state income tax."" Millions of words have been spilled arguing about the effect taxes have on the economy. We can’t resolve that debate here, but we wanted to check Weinstein’s claim that the nine states with no state income tax outperformed the nine states with the highest state income taxes. It turns out there are metrics that support Weinstein’s point -- and others that contradict it. Arthur Laffer Weinstein told us he was referring to a study from the Laffer Center for Supply-Side Economics authored by Arthur Laffer, the so-called ""father of supply-side economics,"" and Stephen Moore, another pre-eminent supply-side economist. Laffer’s argument in ""Taxes Really Do Matter"" has been persuasive. He actually helped design the Kansas tax cuts that Weinstein was defending, and Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback seemed to refer to Laffer’s research when he said that ""pro-growth states with no state income taxes … are among the country’s strongest economic performers."" Laffer and Moore analyzed nine ""no-tax"" states (Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, Wyoming, Tennessee and New Hampshire) and compared them to nine ""high-tax"" states (California, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon and Vermont). Laffer and Moore look at the average growth from 2001-10 for each set of states in four factors: population, Gross State Product (GSP: GDP but for states), employment, and state and local tax revenue. By each of these four measures, the nine states without an income tax outperform the high-tax states. Another way to look at it So Weinstein cited Laffer’s study accurately. But there is more to the story. Dick Lavine, a senior fiscal analyst at the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, said Laffer’s measures are not what economists usually use to judge a state’s success. ""The trouble with Laffer’s study is that fast-growing states look good by his measure mainly because of population growth, not because of any excellence in the economy."" The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) -- a research group that partners with Citizens for Tax Justice, which advocates for the tax interests of middle- and lower-class families -- responded to Laffer’s research with its own study, ""‘High rate’ Income Tax States Are Outperforming No-Tax States."" The results, as you might imagine, are 100 percent opposite of the Laffer analysis. Whereas the Laffer Center study looks at raw totals, ITEP looked at three per capita statistics that Ralph Martire, executive director of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, called ""the three major economic indicators."" ""The nine states with the highest individual income tax rates had better change in median wage (-0.7 percent to -3.5 percent) and significantly better growth in state GSP per capita (10.1 percent to 8.7 percent),"" Martire said, while ""no-tax states had marginally better unemployment."" Other factors While the Laffer Center study argues that population is a valid measure for economic growth -- they look in particular at migrants between high-tax and no-tax states -- it’s tough to attribute that growth solely to the absence of an income tax. ""The majority of population growth is natural increase,"" Lavine said, noting that Texas and Florida have relatively high Latino populations, who statistically have more kids per family. Eight of the no-tax states are also in the South and West, which have seen their populations increase since the popularization of air conditioning after World War II. Even setting aside population, income tax alone doesn’t capture the full difference between states, said Jay Ritter, professor of finance at the University of Florida. ""As the ITEP notes, some states have no income taxes because they can generate revenue from taxing tourists or taxing oil extraction,"" Ritter said. ""Lowering income tax rates or eliminating them does attract residents, but if lower revenue is generated, at least in the short run, the state has to either increase other taxes or cut expenditures."" Texas, for example, has particularly high local property taxes and is also having problems funding its school system, according to the New York Times. Scott Drenkard, an economist for the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that differences between states make it hard to draw conclusions just from the Laffer Center’s nine versus nine comparison. Case studies ""can be fruitful,"" Drenkard said, ""but you should be careful to try to compare apples-to-apples as much as possible."" Our ruling Defending Kansas’ tax cuts, Weinstein claimed that the states that are doing ""better"" are the ones that have no income state tax. Weinstein is accurately citing a study by the Laffer Center that compares states on their growth in population, GSP, total jobs, and total state and local tax revenue. To Laffer, no-tax states are besting high-tax states. But we found another study from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy that concluded the exact opposite, by using a different set of measurements. In the end, measuring ""better"" ultimately is in the eye of the beholder, and we’re not going to settle this economics debate. But Weinstein isn’t going to either.

No, Gretchen Carlson didn't say 2nd Amendment written before guns invented
","Clickbait websites love to make up fake quotes for celebrities and controversial politicians, hoping to mislead readers into clicking into their content and seeing their ads. For instance, we recently fact-checked a post accusing former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., of saying something she didn’t say; we rated it Pants on Fire. Now, as part of Facebook’s efforts to fight fake news, we learned that users had flagged as questionable a post from someone Bachmann used to babysit for -- former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson. (Yes, the babysitting part is actually true.) The claim about Carlson appeared first on a site called therightists.com. It was headlined, ""Gretchen Carlson: ‘The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented.’ "" Within days, the item was picked up and reprinted essentially verbatim on other websites. One version got 31,400 shares through July 24. The accompanying article uses as its launching-off point something that Carlson did actually do -- making an on-air break with conservative orthodoxy by saying, in the wake of the Orlando nightclub mass shooting in 2016, that the assault-weapons ban should be reinstated. ""Do we need AR-15s to hunt and kill deer? Do we need them to protect our families?"" she asked on air. ""Can’t we hold true the sanctity of the Second Amendment while still having common sense?"" These comments drew opposition from gun-rights supporters. It’s at this point that the article veers off into fabrication. The article reads, ""Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that ‘the fact that you’re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you’re ignorant. Don’t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?’ "" This would be a ridiculous claim if she’d actually said it. As schoolchildren are taught, muskets were used in the American Revolution. (Here’s an example from the collection of the Museum of the American Revolution.) And the revolution occurred more than a decade before the 1789 drafting and ratification of the Bill of Rights, which includes the Second Amendment. (""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."") Indeed, the history of firearms goes back even further than that -- to the 1300s, more than four centuries before the Second Amendment was written. The first hint that this may be bogus appears elsewhere on therightists.com website. On the site’s ""About Us"" page, a grammatically challenged warning explains that therightists.com ""is independent News platform That allow People and independent Journalist to bring the news directly to the readers. Readers come to us as a source of independent news that not effected from the big channels. This is HYBRID site of news and satire. part of our stories already happens, part, not yet. NOT all of our stories are true!"" Of course, this warning isn’t noted on the actual page the Carlson story appears on. We also couldn’t find any credible news source reporting Carlson’s words as cited in therightists.com article. Finally, we checked with Carlson’s office. In a statement, her office confirmed that the article was ""total B.S."" Bottom line: Carlson did not say, ""The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented.""

Reports that Oscar Pistorius committed suicide in prison are fake

$13 million in crops rotted in Calif. because no one wanted to pick them?
","A news story about California farmers losing money because of a labor shortage has drawn attention on Facebook because it lays the blame on President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. A June 28, 2017, post on LeftScoop.com ran under the headline, ""Over $13 million worth of crops have ROTTED in California, all because no one is willing to work jobs vacated by migrants."" The link has been shared more than 90,000 times in three weeks. Facebook users flagged the story as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media giant’s efforts to combat fake news. In this case, the story isn’t fake. But it’s not accurate, either. The post is largely comprised almost entirely of uncredited passages from two legitimate news sources. It then adds anti-Trump sentiment for effect. We emailed the website that created the post, LeftScoop.com, to ask about the post and why the site did not include its sources but didn’t get a reply. The post was removed shortly after our inquiry. The LeftScoop.com article starts by using several slightly edited paragraphs from a June 22 story from the Santa Barbara Independent, a weekly alternative newspaper based in Santa Barbara, Calif. ""Labor shortage leaves $13 million in crops to rot in fields,"" the newspaper article’s headline read. The LeftScoop.com post also borrows from a 2017 Mother Jones article. The Independent’s story said that the county’s agricultural industry has suffered labor shortages from 15 to 26 percent annually for five consecutive years. It cited Grower-Shipper Association of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties statistics that said $13 million worth of strawberries, broccoli and other produce were plowed under, up from $4.4 million worth five years ago. Other outlets have cited the Independent story when writing about the subject. LeftScoop.com’s post implied Trump was largely to blame for the lost crops because he had scared off Mexican migrant workers with his tough policies, causing the labor shortages. That’s wrong. Claire Wineman, the Grower-Shipper Association’s president, told us Santa Barbara County has been experiencing the same lack of workers felt by agricultural areas across California and the United States. The dollar figure in the story came from an annual survey the Grower-Shipper Association sent to local farmers, asking them to quantify how much gross revenue they estimated they had lost due to a lack of a sufficient number of field workers. The total from 68 respondents amounted to $13.5 million for the 2015 calendar year. Trump took office Jan. 20, 2017. ""We absolutely have been experiencing labor shortages over the last few years,"" Wineman said. The Independent’s story, she said, did a fair job of describing the reasons, which go back years before Trump took office. One thing the Independent story (and therefore the LeftScoop.com post) did misrepresent was in the headline, Wineman said. The survey didn’t determine whether the crops went unharvested and rotted in the fields. ""We didn’t survey what happened, we only asked how much revenue was not realized because of a lack of workers,"" Wineman said. ""We just don’t know that."" LeftScoop.com said, ""Over $13 million worth of crops have ROTTED in California, all because no one is willing to work jobs vacated by migrants."" The post, which has since been removed, is almost entirely copied from uncredited articles from two more reputable news outlets. There is a labor shortage in central California’s agricultural corridor, but that $13 million is just for Santa Barbara County, not the whole state, as was implied. The association that determined the total also noted there was no data on whether the crops had really been left to rot in fields. The dollar figure was measured through a survey of farmers’ potential lost revenue. As for the reasons for the shortage, LeftScoop.com drastically oversimplifies the issue in the text by interjecting that Trump’s immigration policies are to blame for a lack of migrant workers. For starters, the data is from 2015, more than a year before Trump became president. This post is partially accurate, but not much more.

Will Philly’s murder rate be the highest this decade, as AG Jeff Sessions said?
","On Friday, another member of the Trump administration discussed crime in Philly. In town for a speech to law enforcement officials, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions started talking about violent crime, similar to the way his boss did in January at the GOP Retreat. Back then, Trump made a statement we at PolitiFact PA quickly decided was false, saying, ""Here in Philadelphia the murder has been steady — I mean — just terribly increasing."" Sessions said, ""Preliminary data show murders are up 20 percent from last year. It will put the murder rate at the highest this decade in the city."" First off, the murder rate is up 20 percent so far this year. The morning he was speaking, it was actually up 21 percent over the same day as last year and has hovered near 20 every day for at least the last several weeks. But here we are fact-checking the latter part of the statement: whether the homicide rate this year will be the highest of this decade so far and whether it’s reasonable to make such a projection. When Sessions spoke Friday morning, the homicide count for Philadelphia was 174, according to the Philadelphia Police Department. Given 201 days had so far lapsed this year at that point, Philadelphia had experienced about .87 homicides per day. That rate would lead to 315 or 316 homicides by the end of the year. The total would not be enough to be considered the highest of the 2010s decade, or for the 10-year period of 2008 to 2017. In 2011, 326 homicides occurred here. In 2012, the number was 331. The projected total of 316 would be about 5 percent lower than either of those years, but higher than in any other year of this decade so far. But the other question is whether the number says anything meaningful at this point in the year. ""There is so much variability in a low-volume crime such as homicide,"" said Jerry Ratcliffe, a criminal justice professor at Temple,  ""that predicting months ahead isn’t wise."" Indeed, last year’s homicide total appeared to be rising compared to 2015 about midway through the year. As of September 2016, the rate was 9 percent higher than at the same time period the previous year. But by 2016’s end, Philly had 278 homicides, two fewer than in 2015. Ratcliffe has written extensively on this subject and found making early comparisons irrelevant because of fluctuations that are difficult to gauge. In January and February 2014, for instance, Philly saw about 37 percent more homicides than it did in January and February of 2013. But by the end of the year the city’s homicide rate ended up 0.4 percent higher than in 2013. Had Sessions even made his comment just two days later, the homicide total of 174 would have been the same, per Philly Police statistics. But because it was two days later in the year, the year-over-year increase had changed to 17 percent and the projected year-end count to 312 or 313 because of a drop to about .85 homicides per day. Sessions said of Philly, ""Preliminary data show that murders are up at a rate of 20 percent from last year, which will put the murder rate at the highest of this decade in the city."" Homicides are up about 20 percent — and consistently have been for some time — but the latter half of his statement is wrong. With 174 murders as of 11:59 p.m. Thursday, Philly was on pace to see about 316 by year’s end. The total would be lower than in 2011 (326) and 2012 (331). That’s not a sizable gap but still wouldn’t put the homicide count at the highest of this decade. On top of that, the merits of making such projections are questionable, given the high variability of homicide. We rule the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/jul/24/jeff-sessions/will-phillys-murder-rate-be-highest-decade-ag-jeff/

Jeff Sessions cites study on sanctuary cities, researchers say he misrepresented it
","Attorney General Jeff Sessions told law enforcement officers that cities with policies protecting immigrants have more violent crime and attributed the conclusion to a university study. ""When cities like Philadelphia, Boston, or San Francisco advertise that they have these (‘sanctuary city’) policies, the criminals take notice,"" Sessions said July 12 in Las Vegas. ""According to a recent study from the University of California Riverside, cities with these policies have more violent crime on average than those that don’t."" Local jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal immigration officers are commonly called ""sanctuary cities."" There isn’t one particular policy followed by all jurisdictions, and the extent and situations in which they restrict cooperation varies nationwide. Sessions said there were ""some 300 jurisdictions"" refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities and that they were ""protecting criminals rather than their law-abiding residents."" Data and research on so-called sanctuary cities and their impact on crime is limited. So we were curious about Sessions' citation of a university study. It turns out Sessions’ effort to use research to back his claim got some bad grades from the professors. Study researchers disputed Sessions’ conclusion of their work and said they were unaware of other studies supporting the attorney general’s claim. Here we will lay out the study, Sessions’ assessment and the researchers’ response. President Donald Trump opposes sanctuary cities, contending they are a haven for criminal immigrants. He routinely cites as an example the death of Kate Steinle, a San Francisco woman whom authorities say was fatally shot by an immigrant in the country illegally who had been previously deported five times. Trump campaigned on a promise to cut federal funding for sanctuary cities, hoping that the threat of losing money will make them assist federal authorities. A judge has blocked Trump’s executive order toward this end, but a House bill for this measure passed in June. We’ve fact-checked many claims on sanctuary cities and public safety. Experts routinely tell us there isn’t abundant research specifically about sanctuary cities and their impact on crime. Sanctuary ordinances have been around for decades, but only until recently have social scientists studied their effect on crime rates, Elizabeth F. Cohen, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University, told us for a previous fact-check on a claim of studies showing sanctuary cities ""do not lead to an increase in crime because of the presence of people that are undocumented."" Researchers from the study Sessions cited found that sanctuary policies do not affect crime rates either way. The study analyzed crime data from jurisdictions that ""expressly forbid city officials or police departments from inquiring into immigration status"" and analyzed it in two methods. First, researchers compared cities’ crime rate in the year before and the year after a policy’s implementation. In the second approach, they ""matched each sanctuary city to a similarly situated non-sanctuary city based on relevant census and political variables,"" the authors explained in an October 2016 post in the Washington Post’s Monkey Cage blog. At the end, ""We find no statistically discernible difference in violent crime rate, rape, or property crime across the cities. Our findings provide evidence that sanctuary policies have no effect on crime rates, despite narratives to the contrary,"" said the 2016 study, titled ""The Politics of Refuge: Sanctuary Cities, Crime, and Undocumented Immigration."" The researchers were from the University of California at Riverside and Highline College. Sessions, however, based his claim on one figure in the study that depicted two lines comparing violent crime among sanctuary and non-sanctuary cities between 2000 and 2014. The graph showed that violent crime was higher in sanctuary cities than in non-sanctuary cities. (Figure from University of California at Riverside and Highline College study on sanctuary cities.) In a statement, the Justice Department said, ""The Attorney General accurately cited data from a study that clearly showed that the violent crime rate was higher in sanctuary cities versus non-sanctuary cities. That is a fact and assertions to the contrary ignore that data."" But the text of the study offered a note about the figure. ""If the two lines for each year cross each other at any point, then the relationship between violent crime and city-type is not statistically significant,"" the paper said. ""While there is a mild tendency to have slightly more crime in sanctuary cities, these sanctuary cities effects are very small, and are not statistically significant."" The study researchers said Sessions ignored additional information in the study. ""Without consulting our paper (or piece on the Monkey Cage blog) yes, the graph does appear to show that crime is higher in sanctuary cities,"" Benjamin Gonzalez-O’Brien, one of the authors of the study told PolitiFact. ""However, the vertical lines in the figure represent confidence intervals, which capture statistical uncertainty. Basically, the actual crime rate could be anywhere in that range, from the bottom of the vertical line to the top. Because these confidence intervals are large and overlap with those of non-sanctuary cities, it cannot be said that crime rates in sanctuaries are higher than in non-sanctuaries."" The study includes another figure that shows violent crime before and after passage of sanctuary city policies. Post-implementation, some cities had higher crime rates, others had lower rates and others saw no change, according to the study. (Figure from University of California at Riverside and Highline College study on sanctuary cities.) ""If sanctuary policies led to increased crime, then any city that passes one should have a higher crime rate following its passage. This is not the case,"" Gonzalez-O’Brien said. ""Taken together, these two pieces of evidence suggest no relationship between sanctuary status and crime."" Gonzalez-O’Brien and colleague Loren Collingwood wrote a blog post for Monkey Cage refuting Sessions’ characterization of their work. It’s headlined, ""Jeff Sessions used our research to claim that sanctuary cities have more crime. He’s wrong."" Sessions on July 21 also spoke about sanctuary city policies to law enforcement officials in Philadelphia. He did not cite the researchers’ study, according to a copy of the remarks provided by the Justice Department. Sessions claimed, ""According to a recent study from the University of California Riverside, (sanctuary) cities with these policies have more violent crime on average than those that don’t."" Sessions’ claim is based on one figure of the study that does appear to show that violent crime is higher in sanctuary cities. But the researchers say Sessions mischaracterized the findings and failed to consider additional information in the study. Vertical lines in the figure represent confidence intervals and capture statistical uncertainty, one of the researchers said. Another figure in the study also shows that post-sanctuary policies, some cities had higher crime rates, others had lower rates and others saw no change. Overall, the study concluded that sanctuary policies had no effect on crime rates. Sessions’ statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Was Adam Putnam, candidate for Florida governor, for amnesty on immigration?
","Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam has largely had the Republican field for governor to himself, but the camp of one potential primary challenger has portrayed Putnam as soft on immigration and undocumented immigrants. Tony Fabrizio, a pollster hired by Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran who may challenge Putnam in the 2018 primary, cast Putnam as not being conservative enough. ""He was for amnesty,"" Fabrizio told Politico July 10, while criticizing Putnam’s positions on a long list of issues. That a-word can be a powerful weapon in a Republican primary. But we found that Putnam’s record on immigration can’t be boiled down to a soundbite. As a member of Congress from 2001 to 2010, Putnam represented a Central Florida district that included agribusiness interests that wanted immigrant labor. Putnam supported legislation that would have benefitted undocumented farm workers, and he supported changing immigration laws which included a path to citizenship. But he also took some stances that didn’t benefit undocumented immigrants, such as opposing the DREAM Act and increasing enforcement. The challenge in fact-checking attacks about ""amnesty"" is that it is a vague term and people with opposing views about immigration may define it differently. Some view amnesty as blanket permission for undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States, while others view amnesty as any measure that is favorable to any undocumented immigrants, even if it includes a list of tough measures they have to meet. (Dictionary definitions generally view amnesty as a pardon.) However, there is one key piece of legislation that was undoubtedly amnesty, and it was signed by Republican President Ronald Reagan. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 said that illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by Jan. 1, 1982, and met a few other minimal requirements. The law was widely described as an amnesty program. By contrast, the legislation written by eight senators (including Marco Rubio) in 2013 had several hurdles before undocumented immigrants could get legal status and on a path to citizenship. When Rubio said that the bill wasn’t amnesty, we rated his statement Half True. Fabrizio pointed to stances Putnam took in favor of expanding visas for workers and in favor of changing immigration laws. Here are some examples: Work visas: In 2003, three Arizona Republicans in the House and Senate introduced the Border Security and Immigration Improvement Act, which would have given migrants temporary work visas for three-year terms and then allow them to seek lawful permanent resident status. Those who were already here illegally would get a separate visa and have to wait six years to apply for legal status and pay a $1,500 fine. Critics derided the legislation as amnesty, but sponsors said it wasn’t amnesty because illegal crossers would have to get in the back of the line. Putnam was one of 12 cosponsors of the house. The legislation never reached a vote. AgJobs: Putnam co-sponsored AgJobs bills in 2007 and 2009 that would have provided a ""blue card"" to undocumented farm workers already in the United States. After paying a fine, they could eventually apply for a green card to get permanent legal status if they continued to work in agriculture. The legislation was also intended to overhaul rules on farm worker visas. These measures died without reaching a vote. In 2009, Putnam defended the legislation as an ""effort to have a stable, legal workforce for agriculture, so this country won't be as dependent on others for food as it is for fuel."" Path to legal status: During his tenure in Congress and after he left, Putnam made statements in favor of legislation that included a path to legal status and eventual opportunity for citizenship. In June 2013 while he was Florida’s agriculture commissioner, Putnam told reporters that he supported the ""Gang of Eight"" bill which he saw as a benefit to multiple industries including agriculture. ""It makes improvements at the border and employee verification, while also creating a more modern visa program so that jobs in our economy can be filled when there is a shortfall of domestic labor,"" he told the Lakeland Ledger. ""That has been particularly acute in agriculture."" Arizona-style law: In 2011, while agriculture commissioner, Putnam was against a proposal in Florida to adopt an Arizona-style law to give police the ability to request immigration documents. He called for a national solution to immigration laws instead and said Florida couldn’t cut and paste legislation from Arizona, a border state. Putnam’s campaign spokeswoman Amanda Bevis pointed to stances Putnam took that showed he was against sanctuary policies created by cities or states that won’t share immigration information with federal officials and votes in favor of securing the border. Sanctuary cities: Putnam voted for measures that would ban federal funding for states and localities that have sanctuary policies in 2006 and 2007. Border security: Putnam took several votes in favor of border security measures and funding enforcement. For example, he was one of multiple cosponsors of the Secure Fence Act of 2006 and voted for the legislation. The law signed by President George W. Bush authorized about 700 miles of fencing between the border of the United States and Mexico. Law enforcement: Putnam supported measures to empower state and local law officials to help enforce federal immigration laws in 2006 and 2007. Dreamers: In 2010, Putnam voted against a Senate amendment on a bill that included a DREAM Act provision, which would have allowed children brought illegally to the United States as minors to stay. Against other benefits: In 2008, Putnam voted that undocumented immigrants should be ineligible for federal housing assistance. After meeting with President Barack Obama and lawmakers at the White House in 2009, Putnam said in a statement that he was in favor of securing borders and making reforms to help draw workers to the country. But he stressed that one option is off the table: ""Immigration is a complex issue, so there are any number of reforms possible, but granting amnesty to people who are here illegally must not be one of them."" On his campaign website video about immigration, Putnam makes no mention of a path to citizenship and speaks of supporting President Donald Trump’s policies. ""As governor we will work with President Trump to cut funding for sanctuary cities, we will support tighter border security and vetting for refugees from Muslim countries,"" he said. Fabrizio said that Putnam ""was for amnesty."" While in Congress, Putnam supported legislation that would have expanded work visa categories for undocumented immigrants and put them on a path to legal permanent status. After leaving Congress, he supported the 2013 immigration legislation, which wasn’t blanket legal residency but did include a path, albeit a long one, to legal status. Putnam’s campaign points to examples of legislation he supported that weren’t favorable to undocumented immigrants such as toughening up border security and opposing the Dream Act. The claim is partially accurate, but lacks important context. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2017/jul/24/tony-fabrizio/was-adam-putnam-running-florida-governor-amnesty/

Since Obamacare, far fewer New Yorkers are uninsured
","With Republicans lacking the votes to ""repeal and replace"" Obamacare, or to even undo major parts of the law without replacing them, Democrats tout President Barack Obama’s signature legislation a success story in New York state. State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asserted the number of people without health insurance fell by half over the past four years. ""Since 2013 we have cut our uninsured in half from 10 percent up to 5 percent of our population,"" Schneiderman said. The state’s health insurance exchange, NY State of Health, started accepting customers in 2013. States were mandated to either create their own exchanges or participate in one from the federal government. More than 3.6 million people in New York state have enrolled in a health plan through the state exchange since it began, according to the state Department of Health. But is Schneiderman right that the uninsured rate in New York has been cut in half since the exchange began? Data on uninsured New Yorkers  According to Centers for Disease Control data, 10.6 percent of New York state’s population did not have health insurance in 2012, the year before the state health exchange was established. By 2015, the uninsured rate was 4.9 percent, but it increased to 5.4 percent in 2016 - still about half the rate before the law. Explaining the decrease Does Obama's Affordable Care Act deserve the credit? Experts we spoke to said the rate dropped because the state health exchange gave people an easier way to compare health plans online, and premiums dropped 53 percent the first year of the exchange. Average premiums have since increased. ""It’s really just been an incredible boom for New York state, the Affordable Care Act,"" said Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Serve Society of New York. New York state also opted into an option in Obamacare that provides low-cost health insurance to people who make too much for Medicaid but not enough to buy insurance. More than 665,000 state residents have enrolled in the plan since it first became available in 2015, Benjamin said. New York and Minnesota are the only two states with this option. The state also expanded the income threshold for Medicaid eligibility. That allowed some people to get coverage through Medicaid. Our ruling Schneiderman said ""we have been able to cut New York’s uninsured rate in half since 2013 from 10 percent to 5 percent."" He’s right on the numbers. The uninsured rate in 2013 was 9.6 percent. The latest data shows it at 5.4 percent in 2016.

Fact-check: White House's Conway uses conservative blog to claim media is hostile to Trump
","The White House says the media is hostile to the president and is using some new evidence presented by a conservative blogger to make its case. But that evidence is faulty. On Fox News on Saturday, Kellyanne Conway, one of President Donald Trump’s top advisers, argued that the media blocks important White House messaging by covering issues the public sees as unimportant. ""This is a media that has decided it’s going be very hostile,"" Conway told Fox News host Jeanine Pirro on July 22, 2017. Conway then cited two different bits of research to contrast the percentage of news coverage devoted to different political issues and the public’s general interest in each issue. ""People were asked, which of the following issues is most important to you?"" Conway said. ""Health care, 35 percent (of people said it was the most important issue, but it) got like 10 percent of the coverage. Russia, 6 percent most important issue, received 75 percent of the coverage. Immigration, 10 percent most important issue, zero percent of the coverage."" New White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made a similar claim on ABC’s This Week. ""Look, there was a Wall Street Journal poll that came out this week that showed that the top three issues that Americans care about are immigration, health care, and jobs. The top three issues that the media cares about are Russia, Russia, and Russia,"" Huckabee Sanders said. ""There's 15 times more coverage on Russia than on the three big issues that Americans care about. That's a problem. That's exactly the definition of Russia fever."" The poll Huckabee Sanders is talking about came from Bloomberg, not the Wall Street Journal, and it found that health, jobs and terrorism were the top three important issues among respondents (not immigration, health care and jobs). That said, we wondered more broadly if the White House’s claim the media is devoting 75 percent of its coverage to the Russia investigation while few people claim it is the country’s most important issue. Conway’s claim stems from a post on the conservative blog Ricochet.com comparing a Bloomberg poll that asked Americans what they see as the most important issue facing the country right now to a June 27 Media Research Center survey of the time broadcast networks’ evening newscasts devoted to different issues. Bloomberg’s poll found that six percent of Americans said the United States’ ""relationship with Russia"" is the most important issue facing the country right now, behind health care, immigration, jobs, terrorism and even climate change. The Media Research Center, a conservative group, tracked coverage on the network news broadcasts of ABC, CBS and NBC from May 17 to June 20. The Ricochet’s Jon Gabriel put these two pieces of information together. He concluded that of 469 combined minutes of coverage of Trump during those broadcasts, 353 focused on either the firing of former FBI Director James Comey or Russia. Put another way, of the broadcasts it analyzed, the Media Research Center found 75 of coverage of Trump focused on questions about Comey or Trump. ""The media have shown how drastically out of step they are with their own audience. If they want to earn back their hemorrhaging Nielsen numbers, perhaps they can spend time on something other than Russia Russia Russia."" Upon deeper analysis, however, the numbers don’t hold up. And experts we spoke to raised serious flaws in comparing the two pieces of research. The Ricochet post misreads the Media Research Center analysis. The Ricochet post appears to use this Media Research Center graphic to count the number of minutes the evening news talked about Trump.  Those categories total 469 minutes, 75 percent of which are about Russia/Comey stories. But the Media Research Center said that it found 640 minutes of total coverage of Trump in its analysis not 469 minutes. That means, excluding anything else, that airtime devoted to the Russia probe constituted 55 percent of all coverage of the Trump presidency during the five weeks following the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. It’s also worth making clear that the Media Research Center study was only analyzing coverage of Trump, not all media coverage. The Media Research Center analysis is limited. It is important to note that this study was only looking at network evening newscasts from ABC, CBS and NBC. It doesn’t include Fox or Fox News, CNN, MSNBC or any other cable news channel. It also doesn’t include newspapers or radio or online publications like Politico. On top of that, the analysis only covers about a month (May 17-June 20). ""A more extensive study would likely have somewhat different results of individual news outlets,"" said Stephen Farnsworth, director of University of Mary Washington's Center for Leadership and Media Studies. ""One of the things you see when you compare newspapers with television is a much wider range of topics being discussed, much more material than in a 30-minute news broadcast."" Other polls show that Americans are interested in the Russia investigation. The question in the Bloomberg poll Conway referenced was not about the Russia investigation. Other polls suggest that Americans are interested in the investigation. A June poll by the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 48 percent of people surveyed said they were extremely or very concerned that Trump or others involved with his campaign had inappropriate contacts with the Russian government during last year’s presidential campaign. Another 20 percent said they were moderately concerned. The White House and Trump play a role in setting what’s covered. Experts told us that it’s also worth noting that the media often covers what elected officials say or do. So if they’re talking more about Russia, the media will, too. Farnsworth pointed to a dearth of committee hearings and public debate on recent Republican health care legislation and the newsworthiness of firing an FBI director. Albert May, Associate Emeritus Professor of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, said Trump’s tweets calling attention to the Russia probe has helped fuel more coverage. At the same time, Trump has kept a relatively quiet public schedule, May said. None of the experts we talked with were surprised by the schism between the public’s policy concerns and the media’s coverage of the issue. ""The longstanding criticism of the press is that you focus on the scandal and not the policy issue like health care, but the truth is that’s what people are most interested in,"" May said. ""The media's issue agenda and the public's issue agenda are never a perfect match,"" said Thomas Patterson, a Bradlee Professor of Government and the Press at Harvard. ""Typically, the public ranks a scandal below policy issues when asked in a poll their opinion of ‘the nation's most important problem.’ So I think what we're seeing in the numbers is business as usual by the national press."" Conway said just 6 percent of Americans say Russia is the country’s most important issue, yet the story receives ""75 percent of the coverage"" in the media. A credible national poll found that six percent of Americans listed the U.S.-Russian relationship as the country’s most important issue. The question did not include any discussion of investigating whether Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. At the same time, an analysis by a conservative research organization shows that network news on ABC, NBC and CBS have made the Russia story an integral part of their Trump coverage. But experts caution about reading too much into the network news analysis, which is limited in scope. And either way, Conway’s numbers are off by 20 percentage points.

Kevin McCarthy's False claim on Obamacare sign-ups
","Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield is no fan of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. But did he accurately characterize sign-ups under the federal health law in a recent interview on Fox Business?   Here’s what he said in the interview on June 11, 2017: ""Remember this, under Obamacare it mandates that you have health insurance. If you don’t, you have to pay a penalty or take a waiver. More people, almost twice as many, pay the penalty or take the waiver than signed up for it."" McCarthy is correct that Obamacare requires people to have health insurance, unless they pay a penalty or claim an exemption. Exemptions are granted based on household income levels. But we wanted to know: Have almost twice as many people really declined health coverage -- by paying the penalty or taking a waiver -- as signed up for Obamacare? And what counts for a ‘sign-up’ under Obamacare? We set out on a fact check. Our research We asked McCarthy’s spokesman for evidence supporting the claim. For the penalty and exemptions, he cited figures from an IRS report to Congress based on tax year 2015, the latest year for which numbers are available. They show: 6.5 million people paid a penalty in 2015 12.7 million people claimed an exemption in 2015 Altogether, 19.2 million declined Obamacare coverage that year. These figures are widely accepted by health policy experts. For Obamacare sign-ups, McCarthy’s spokesman cited a 12.2 million figure for the most recent enrollment period. It’s based on a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services news release, though health policy experts say it’s far from the full picture on Obamacare sign-ups. It shows the number who selected or were automatically re-enrolled in an Obamacare marketplace plan nationally. Looking at the numbers, 19.2 million is not ""almost twice as many"" as 12.2 million. There’s also the larger question: Are the marketplaces the full picture of Obamacare sign-ups? Absolutely not, health policy experts told us. ‘The missing piece’ President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010. The federal law, however, did not go into effect until 2014. When it did, it created two ways to increase the number of people with health insurance in the United States -- the exchanges and an expanded Medicaid program -- said Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. Total sign-ups under the Affordable Care Act’s are closer to 20 million when adding enrollment through the exchanges and Medicaid expansion, Kominski said. That figure comes from a March 2016 report by the Department of Health and Human Services. ""It’s a false statement,"" Kominski said of McCarthy’s claim. ""The category that the congressman conveniently left out of his narrative (is) the roughly 14 million people who were newly enrolled in Medicaid programs around the country. It’s the missing piece."" ""To ignore one category and exclusively focus on the other is disingenuous,"" he added. ""Either that or it shows a fundamental lack of (understanding) of the law."" Kominski advocates for the Affordable Care Act as ""a great step forward"" on his website. ‘It’s certainly part of Obamacare’ Joy Melnikow, Director of the UC Davis Center for Healthcare Policy and Research, agreed Medicaid can’t be ignored. ""It’s certainly part of Obamacare,"" Melnikow said. ""It was the bigger piece of what Obamacare did."" The two main parts of Obamacare, the marketplaces and Medicaid, are more connected than some might think, she added. ""When someone goes to buy insurance on the exchange, the process solicits information about that individual’s income to see if they qualify for Medicaid. If they qualify for Medicaid, the exchange insurance sign-up will route them to sign up for Medicaid."" Absolute conclusions? Drawing an absolute conclusion about how many people signed up for Medicaid because of Obamacare isn’t so simple, noted one health researcher. ""There’s not a clean, easy way to measure who signed up because of the Affordable Care Act,"" said Cynthia Cox, who studies the ACA at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research organization. It’s not always clear, she added, whether enrollees signed up because they heard about Medicaid expansion under the ACA or for other unrelated reasons. Our ruling Congressman Kevin McCarthy claimed almost twice as many people have paid a penalty or taken a waiver as signed up for Obamacare. By focusing only on enrollment through the Obamacare exchanges, McCarthy’s claim presents a narrow and misleading look at total insurance sign-ups under the federal health law. Even under the limited view, those foregoing insurance do not amount to ""almost twice"" the exchange sign-ups. Most notably, the congressman’s claim ignores the huge category of Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. Of the 20 million people who gained coverage under Obamacare through early 2016, about 14 million were under Medicaid. The data show about the same number of people declined coverage -- not ""almost twice as many"" -- as signed-up for Obamacare. We rate McCarthy’s statement False.

One in three people in New York is on Medicaid
","Rep. John Faso, R-Kinderhook, says Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo could do a better job managing the state’s Medicaid program. He has proposed legislation to shift Medicaid costs from counties to the state. Counties outside New York City pay close to $2.3 billion in Medicaid costs annually. Faso says the state could handle the expense if Cuomo cut costs elsewhere or lowered Medicaid spending, which topped $28 billion last year according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy analysis group. That’s more than Texas and Florida combined. ""We now have about one-third of New York’s population on Medicaid,"" Faso said. ""Some people in Albany may look upon that as an accomplishment. I look upon that as a failure."" New York is one of 31 states and the District of Columbia that expanded income eligibility for Medicaid, an option under Obamacare. That opened the door for those who may have been unable to get health insurance otherwise. But is Faso right that a third of the state’s population is on Medicaid? Medicaid numbers in New York About 6.4 million people received Medicaid benefits in New York as of April 2017, the most recent count from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The agency includes enrollees in the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which insures children from families with incomes too high for Medicaid but too low to buy insurance. The state’s population is 19.74 million, according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau numbers. That makes Faso right: 33 percent of the state’s population is enrolled in Medicaid. New York has the second-highest Medicaid participation rate in the country. New Mexico ranked first with almost 38 percent on Medicaid. New York ranked highest before the Obamacare expansion with almost 29 percent of the state’s population on Medicaid in 2013. Our ruling Faso said a third of New York’s population is on Medicaid.

Trump: In Watergate, FBI reported to DOJ as a courtesy
","President Donald Trump talked about how the FBI handled its findings as it investigated the Watergate break-in and its ties to the Nixon White House in a wide-ranging interview with the New York Times. Here’s the transcript from that moment in the conversation with three reporters: ""When Nixon came along (inaudible) was pretty brutal, and out of courtesy, the FBI started reporting to the Department of Justice. But there was nothing official, there was nothing from Congress. There was nothing — anything. But the FBI person really reports directly to the president of the United States, which is interesting."" Watergate began when a team from the re-election campaign of President Richard Nixon broke into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, photographed documents and bugged the phones. Police caught several team members at about 2:30 a.m. June 17, 1972, and an FBI investigation began that same night. The break-in, the cover-up and efforts by the White House to obstruct the work of the FBI led to multiple convictions and Nixon’s resignation in August 1974. In Trump’s view, as the investigation moved forward, the FBI kept the Justice Department informed as a courtesy. Trump’s statement runs into some problems with history. Cleveland attorney James Robenalt, who runs a course on the lessons of Watergate, said there is no basis for Trump’s claim. ""The director of the FBI reports to the Attorney General, and it was not a matter of ‘courtesy during Watergate’ to report to the Department of Justice, rather standard operating procedure,"" he said. ""For verification look at the organization chart of the Department of Justice."" The full chart clearly shows that the FBI answers to the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General. Benjamin Wittes, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and the editor of Lawfare, a respected legal affairs blog, said there was a thread of accuracy behind his statement. Watergate, Wittes said, was a turning point. Trump might have been thinking of what existed up to that time. ""There are a whole series of norms that developed in the post-Watergate era that the president stay out of investigative matters and that we expect the FBI director to stay out of political matters,"" Wittes said. Certainly, the history of the FBI under the leadership of J. Edgar Hoover is chock full of instances where the FBI dealt directly with the White House. That took place even over the express orders of a series of Attorneys General, including Robert F. Kennedy. Wittes also said that the president has the power to hire and fire the FBI director and, in that sense, the director ultimately is answerable to the president. But Trump made the broad assertion that there was ""nothing official"" that compelled the FBI to report to the Justice Department. We raised this issue with the White House press office and did not get an answer. We found that the historic record runs counter to Trump’s words. The annual reports of the Justice Department from 1907 to 1910 spell out in no uncertain terms that the FBI (known simply as the Bureau of Investigation back then) was created precisely in order to report to the Justice Department. Attorney General Charles Bonaparte (a great-nephew of the French emperor) under President Theodore Roosevelt first made the case for an investigative division in his 1907 report to Congress. ""A Department of Justice with no force of permanent police in any form under its control is assuredly not fully equipped for its work,"" he said."" Bonaparte created the bureau in 1908, as his successor noted in his report in 1909. ""A few days before July 1, 1908, under the direction of my predecessor, the first active steps were taken toward the organization in this department of a comprehensive investigation service for the purpose of collecting evidence for the use of the government in cases pending or about to be commenced in the federal courts, and also for making such other examinations and investigations as the business of the department might require."" The 1910 annual report noted that the Attorney General is ""kept constantly informed of the progress of all investigations."" J. Edgar Hoover, according to several historians, accepted the job in 1924 only on the understanding that ""the Bureau will be responsible only to the Attorney General."" Even if Hoover didn’t follow that principle, the annual reports to Congress establish that the FBI was created by and for the Justice Department. From the very beginning, it reported to the department, and that practice didn’t start during Watergate. In 1974, the Justice Department conducted its own review of the FBI’s actions in Watergate. It concluded that the agency ""followed well established departmental policies"" and ""all information developed indicating any possible violations of federal law was properly referred to the department."" In fact, in direct contradiction to Trump’s understanding, it faulted the FBI for sharing reports with Nixon’s White House counsel, calling it ""probably the most serious blunder from an investigative standpoint."" ""FBI reports should be disseminated only to the prosecutor and certainly never to the White House,"" the report said. Trump said ""out of courtesy, the FBI started reporting to the Department of Justice"" in the course of the Watergate investigation, and that there was ""nothing official."" Justice Department annual reports dating from the birth of the FBI and the organizational structure of the Justice Department show that Trump is wrong. During Watergate, the FBI reported to the Attorney General’s Office because that is what it was created to do. It was not a matter of courtesy. Trump’s ability to hire and fire the FBI director gives him ultimate authority over the conduct of the FBI director, but that's separate from the reporting obligations of the bureau to the Justice Department.

Did Donald Trump cut $18 billion worth of red tape, as Mike Pence said?
","Vice President Mike Pence says that when it comes to deregulation, President Donald Trump’s record is historic. Trump ""has signed more laws cutting through federal red tape than any president in American history and has already saved businesses and families up to $18 billion in red tape costs every year,"" Pence said in a speech at the National Retail Federation's Annual Retail Advocates Summit on July 18, 2017. Looking at the first half of the statement, we wondered, has Trump surpassed his predecessors in deregulation? And, is the savings $18 billion? It’s not so easy to quantify laws that cut red tape. Experts we spoke with said that other presidents have cut through more red tape than Trump so far, citing the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, as well as President Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan’s deregulation of such previously heavily regulated industries as air travel, trucking, banking and telecommunications. However, many of these measures were taken through federal agencies, or constituted a single law, whereas Pence cited a record number of laws passed. "" ‘Laws cutting red tape’ is a sufficiently ambiguous phrase that it is nearly impossible to say who has cut the most,"" said Jon Schaff, a professor of political science at Northern University. ""If you were going to judge Pence’s claim, you’d have to go through all laws for all presidents and then decide whether each law was deregulatory in some manner and then how much did it deregulate. How does one judge such a thing? How much ‘red tape’ was saved through welfare reform in the 1990s? Or simply getting rid of federal controls on speed limits on highways? Or tax reform in 1986?"" When we asked Pence’s office for clarification, spokesperson Marc Lotter said that Trump had signed 14 Congressional Review Act measures compared with one previously. He’s right. President Bill Clinton signed the Congressional Review Act in 1994, and it allows lawmakers to overturn regulations by federal agencies within 60 legislative days of their issue dates. It mainly applies when a new administration is aligned with the new Congress, and both oppose a certain set of last-minute regulations from the previous president. Unlike executive authority -- which requires notice to the public and hearings, and produces outcomes that are often challenged in court -- Congressional Review Act measures only require an up-or-down majority vote in Congress. ""Pence’s office is clearly, unambiguously correct when it comes to Trump signing 14 Congressional Review Act resolutions to just one for all previous presidents — though do note that it is called the Congressional Review Act, and really it would be more fair to say that Congress initiated those actions, and Trump was in a position to ratify their choices,"" said Philip Wallach, a senior fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution. Has Trump already saved Americans $18 billion with his deregulatory measures? Lotter directed us to research by the right-leaning policy group American Action Forum to back up the talking point. The AAF calculated $1.1 billion in savings, using the Federal Register’s estimated costs of regulations issued by the Obama administration that were repealed by Congressional Review Act measures. ""In addition, President Trump has formally delayed and signaled an intention to amend several other major rules. Combined, these actions could generate more than $18 billion in annual regulatory savings for businesses, investors, and consumers,"" the AAF said in the cited report. An updated AAF post places this estimate closer to $21.8 billion. We first parsed through the $1.1 billion saved by the historic CRA measures, which checks out with the Federal Register data. What doesn’t check out is Pence’s statement that these dollars have already been saved. The reason it was possible for Trump to roll back these rules was that they had been put in place at the end of the previous administration, which also means that many of them hadn’t yet taken effect. Take the Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers, a rule that would require energy companies to report to the Federal Exchange Committee payments made to foreign governments. The AAF calculated its rollback would save $590.7 million annually, but those savings would only begin on Sept. 30, 2018, the rule’s required compliance date. The rollback of the Stream Protection Rule, calculated to save $81 million annually, would only start in 2020. With compliance dates months or years in the future, businesses were unlikely to have sunk costs to comply with these rules according to Amit Narang, a regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen, a left-leaning government watchdog group. The calculation of costs also ignores the benefits of these rules and industry innovation that may reduce the cost of compliance. In the Office of Management and Budget’s last annual report computing the costs and benefits of the federal regulations that were produced between 2005 and 2015, they found that benefits outweighed costs. ""In 2014 dollars, aggregate annual benefits are estimated to be between $269 and $872 billion and costs between $74 and $110 billion,"" the report said. ""These ranges reflect uncertainty in the benefits and costs of each rule at the time that it was evaluated."" We then went on to look at the larger chunk of costs the AAF analyzed to come up with total annual savings from executive actions (not just Congressional Act Review measures). These potential savings were calculated using the costs estimated by the Federal Register at the time the legislation was put in place. Taking these cost estimates as full savings assumes that the Trump administration will be able to fully annul rules that experts expect would take years to achieve. For example, the executive action to dismantle the Clean Power Act would theoretically save $8.4 billion annually, but it will take a years-long rulemaking process to complete. The executive order to roll back the Gainful Employment Rule, estimated to save $433 million annually, will be delayed due to a court challenge. The last chunk of the $21.8 billion estimate came from rule delays, which brings us back to our concern with saying the administration has saved the costs from future regulations cut by CRA measures. These costs weren’t straining families and businesses to begin with, because they were not yet in effect, and have simply been pushed further back. The Office of Management and Budget’s latest calculation of the Trump administration’s annualized cost savings estimated these at $22 million, which is significantly lower than Pence’s $18 billion figure. We repeatedly reached out to the OMB for more details on their projections but did not hear back.  Pence said Trump ""has signed more laws cutting through federal red tape than any President in American history and has already saved businesses and families up to $18 billion in red tape costs every year.""   Whether Trump has signed more laws cutting red tape depends upon how you count legislation. Trump did sign a record number of laws rolling back regulations under the Congressional Review Act, but that’s not the only way to count deregulatory action. Also, Pence is counting eggs before they hatch in using an $18 billion estimate of total savings. The deadlines for compliance for most of the measures he annulled had yet to go into effect, and the fate of many of the executive actions that would back past regulation remains unclear.

Nixon sometimes met with leaders without his own translator
","President Donald Trump’s private discussion with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit is highly unusual but not completely without precedent, a foreign policy expert said on MSNBC. Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group consulting firm, told Rachel Maddow on July 18, 2017, that Trump’s side meeting with Putin at a dinner with heads of state was definitely unusual. Trump met with Putin on July 7 for an official meeting during the summit. But then he sat next to Putin at the dinner later that day with only a Russian translator present and no other American officials. (Trump told the New York Times they ""talked about Russian adoption."") But Richard Nixon was also known to hold meetings with foreign dignitaries without an American interpreter, Bremmer said. ""Apparently, President Nixon used to do it because he felt, didn't really trust the State Department, at that point, providing the translators and didn't want information getting out, leaking, that he would want to keep private,"" he said. We attempted to contact Bremmer through his Eurasia Group communications director but didn’t get a response. But he doesn’t appear to be losing much of anything in translation here. It turns out that on a couple of occasions, Nixon did meet with officials solo, although the circumstances were a bit different than Trump’s meeting with Putin. Several presidential historians told us that when American presidents meet with foreign heads of state or other officials, there is usually an aide or administration official attending with him. There also is usually an American interpreter present, so that the president may check how the discussion is being translated. ""When a president talks business he wants an aide there from his side to take notes,"" said Nick Cullather, a history professor at Indiana University. ""In diplomacy, if there are no notes, nothing happened."" Nixon did have a strained relationship with the State Department, and noted repeatedly in his memoir RN: The Memories of Richard Nixon that then-National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, especially, did not get along with then-Secretary of State William Rogers. There are anecdotes that Nixon would keep State Department interpreters out of meetings for fear of leaks, but he rarely attended meetings without some other American official present. University of Texas history professor Jeremi Suri said the aide present was often Kissinger, as was the case when Nixon met with Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai on Feb. 21, 1972, without an American translator. There was a National Security Council notetaker there, and an official transcript was filed. ""This violated all diplomatic protocol because it meant Nixon could not check the interpretation of his words,"" Suri said. Prussian-born Harry Obst, who interpreted meetings for seven presidents including Nixon, recounted in his own book White House Interpreter that he had been barred from translating some meetings with German-speaking officials. One example Obst gave was at the behest of Kissinger, who was born in Germany and could understand German. But the most comparable instances were when Nixon met with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. Nixon relied on the Russian translator Viktor Sukhodrev, who worked for the Soviets, during one meeting at a summit between the two leaders in Moscow on May 22, 1972. The meeting was recorded and Sukhodrev took notes, according to State Department footnotes. ""There had been concern expressed that I should have a State Department translator present also,"" Nixon wrote in his memoir. ""But I knew that Sukhodrev was a superb linguist who spoke English as well as he did Russian, and I felt that Brezhnev would speak more freely if only one other person was present."" The situation was repeated when Brezhnev visited Washington a year later. Sukhodrev was the only interpreter for an Oval Office discussion between Nixon and Brezhnev on June 18, 1973. State Department footnotes said this meeting also was recorded. Both conversations took place during official visits, and administration staff was aware of the meetings. The biggest difference between Nixon’s discussions and Trump’s, however, is that a record of what the leaders talked about exists in State Department records. Bremmer had noted the lack of an official account of Trump’s second G20 meeting with Putin during his MSNBC appearance. ""They (Trump and Putin) were out of earshot, so, I mean, unless the Russian translator has a tape — and I think there’s a reasonable likelihood that he does — then, you know, nobody else is going to have a readout of this meeting,"" Bremmer said. Bremmer said, ""Apparently, President Nixon used to do it (hold meetings with heads of state without an American interpreter) because he felt, didn't really trust the State Department, at that point, providing the translators and didn't want information getting out, leaking, that he would want to keep private."" Presidential historians, historical accounts and Nixon’s own memoir show this was the case. But it’s notable that even in the example most comparable to Trump’s meeting with Putin, when Nixon used only a Soviet translator during two meetings with Brezhnev, official records of the meeting exist.

Did the number of A schools increase under former mayor Rick Baker?
","Rick Baker has used mailers, forums and social media to relay one big message in his campaign for St. Petersburg mayor: Schools in St. Petersburg saw drastic improvements when he was mayor from 2001 to 2010. During an interview with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board July 13, Baker touted his efforts to help improve public schools in the city, which included a mentoring program he started in 2001. ""We went from zero A elementary schools when I took office to 16 when I left, and our total A and B schools went up by 260 percent,"" Baker said. ""I don’t take credit for that, I honestly don’t. I know that there’s a lot of factors that build into that, but I’m just saying we were a helper and the schools did not feel abandoned in St. Pete when we did that."" With this talking point coming up again and again, we wondered about the number of A schools Baker referenced. Baker’s data is right on the numbers, but as he acknowledged, there are a lot of factors that can affect school grades. The number of A elementary schools increased  The relevant data comes from the Florida Department of Education. Every year since 1999, the Florida Department of Education has released individual grades for schools in the state after the academic year. The grading formula gauges schools’ performance based on how many students score at grade level and how many students made improvements in core curriculum areas of math, language arts and science. Schools can receive a grade of A, B, C, D, F or I (incomplete). Baker’s evidence for his statement is based on the grades of elementary schools included in his ""Mayor's, Mentors and More"" program, which included the majority of elementary schools in St. Petersburg starting in 2001. The program included initiatives such as scholarships, corporate partnerships and business mentoring. Baker spokeswoman Brigitta Shouppe said schools that had 51 percent of their students living in the city of St. Petersburg were included in the program, ranging from 27 to 30 schools each year. According to the state data, there were zero A elementary schools from that group in 2001. At the end of Baker's last full year in office in 2009, the number of A elementary schools had jumped dramatically to 16. The number of A and B total schools (not just elementary schools) went from seven in July 2001 to 26 in July 2009. That’s an increase of about 271 percent. The improvement in A-rated schools was not a steady build; the number fluctuated year to year. The education department made significant changes to the grading system between 2001 and 2009, so schools were not graded based on the exact same criteria over the eight-year period. ""In the past the department has shown grades over time but has generally also pointed out the changes made from one year to the next,"" said Audrey Walden, Florida Department of Education spokeswoman. School improvement takes a village  As Baker acknowledged, a mayor can only do so much when it comes to local education. The school board sets local education policy and the superintendent carries it out. In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Baker stressed again that the gains were a team effort. ""It’s great for the St. Pete schools to have an advocate in the mayor’s office and do it in partnership with the School's Board and the school system,"" Baker said. Julie Mastry (formerly Julie Janssen), who was Pinellas County superintendent from 2008-11 and deputy superintendent from 2006-08, said the school board and Baker’s office had a ""healthy partnership."" Current Pinellas County School Board member Rene Flowers served on St. Petersburg City Council for a potion of Baker’s term and was clear that she supports Mayor Rick Kriseman in this election. She said ""the mayor has nothing to do"" with daily operations in county schools. ""School reform is complex, and it is hard to attribute improvement to one program or source,"" said Alyson Adams, a clinical associate professor of education at the University of Florida. Adams said that it’s possible Baker’s mentoring program put a greater focus on learning, but added there may also be other programs happening in these schools that contributed to the improvements. Baker’s tenure did not see as much of the effects of the School Board’s vote in December 2007 to end integration and create neighborhood schools. (Baker said he did not have a position on that.) The decision and a lack of follow-up with resources by the board created a concentration of poverty in schools in St. Petersburg's black neighborhoods. The Tampa Bay Times documented the outcome of five elementary schools in its ""Failure Factories"" investigation.   Our ruling Baker said, ""We went from 0 A elementary schools when I took office to 16 when I left, and our total A and B schools went up by 260 percent."" Baker’s evidence comes from the Florida Department of Education and the statistics he cites are accurate. Local community members gave him credit for starting a mentoring program, but Baker himself has acknowledged that many factors outside of the mayor’s control influence school grades.   His statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/jul/21/rick-baker/did-number-schools-increase-under-former-mayor-ric/

Challenger mostly on target with claim that Paul Ryan has gone 600 days without a town hall meeting
","One of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s 2018 challengers has risen to prominence with a flurry of media interviews, a viral campaign launch video and a quick influx of small-dollar donations. In one of those interviews, Democrat Randy Bryce claimed Ryan, a Republican from Janesville, doesn’t face his constituents. Bryce, an ironworker, appeared July 9, 2017, on WISN-TV’s ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,"" where he claimed ""Paul Ryan has not had a public town hall within the district for over 600 days."" With Republicans facing feisty constituents at town hall meetings across the country, has Ryan really not held such a meeting in more than 600 days? What makes a town hall? Just what is a town hall meeting? The answer in the digital age can vary. A look through Ryan’s U.S. House website indicates that the last public, in-person town hall meeting he held was on Oct. 6, 2015, shortly before he was elected Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. Thus, Ryan has gone more than 650 days without holding a similar town hall meeting. That’s where the different definitions come in. David Keith, a spokesman for Bryce, cited a reference.com Q&A that defines a town hall as an informal, in-person meeting between citizens and public figures. ""Many modern town halls are held in locations that are accessible to the public and can accommodate large crowds,"" the site reads.  Historically, town halls are in-person, informal events where people can ask public officials unscripted questions. The Merriam-Webster and Oxford dictionaries’ definitions and usage examples both have a physical connotation. In recent years, Ryan has opted for office hours, telephone town halls and employee town halls -- those done at workplaces. Indeed, the information cited by Bryce from reference.com relies in part on the nonpartisan Congress Management Foundation, which has been looking into the effects of in-person, online and telephone town halls. The foundation conducts research into the evolving methods to host town halls and their comparative effectiveness. Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana said the speaker considers telephone and employee town halls to be forms of public town hall meetings and said telephone town halls make up a significant portion of Ryan’s interactions with constituents. Martorana said they conduct telephone town halls by calling ""every household with a registered voter in the pertinent counties whose contact information we have and who reside in Wisconsin's First District."" He added: ""The calls are not screened, and they are answered in the order they are received."" Employee town halls are another matter. These are typically hosted by private businesses where the audience is usually pre-selected, and so are their questions. The public is largely barred from these events, and reporters are usually unable to ask questions. Ryan recently held two employee town halls while Congress was on break for the Fourth of July holiday, visiting businesses in Oak Creek and Racine. Audience members offered Ryan a series of friendly questions. ""If you had to make a decision between attending an October regular season Packers game or a Brewers World Series game, which one?"" one person asked, according to a CBS news article. The day after he visited those businesses, Ryan took questions from reporters at the state Capitol where he said he was looking for ""creative ways"" to interact with constituents, instead of traditional town hall meetings. Ryan also said he was thinking of safety, trying to avoid a ""screaming fest"" from protesters bused into his district and that having reporters at events limits the conversation. ""I find when you guys are there, people tend to clam up,"" Ryan told reporters on July 7, 2017. Ryan did hold a number of campaign events the day before his 2016 primary election that he billed as town halls -- though they did not match the framework of his last in-person listening session. Reports and a video from the event indicate that it was much more in keeping with the employee town halls meetings. And as campaign events, they had a different purpose than a traditional town hall. Past criticism Ryan has been criticized in the past for not being accessible to his constituents. In February 2017, the left-leaning group Forward Kenosha organized a mock town hall at a union hall where constituents posed questions to an empty chair. In May, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) held a town hall in Ryan’s district. Martorana said Ryan’s office has issued 60,000 responses this year to constituents who have contacted the office by phone, email, fax or letter. He added that recent telephone town halls reached more than 13,000 constituents in Walworth, Rock, Kenosha and Racine counties. In contrast, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner ( R-Wis.), the dean of the state’s congressional delegation, has not shied away from open town halls, sometimes facing raucous crowds. Sensenbrenner has held more than 80 public town halls so far in 2017, according to the calendar on his website. Our rating Bryce said ""Paul Ryan has not had a public town hall within the district for over 600 days."" Bryce’s claim is broad and doesn’t account for the emerging ways people can communicate with public officials, but he’s mostly on target in saying Ryan hasn’t held a traditional town hall in almost two years.

Donald Trump not close in claiming he has signed more bills in first six months than any president
","On ""Made in America Day,"" so proclaimed by President Donald Trump, the president hopped into the driver’s seat of a Wisconsin-made fire truck that was parked on the White House lawn. ""Where’s the fire?"" he joked. ""Put it out fast."" Products from all 50 states were showcased, including the truck made by Pierce Manufacturing in Appleton. During the July 17, 2017 ceremony, Trump made some remarks, including a claim about his productivity. Referring to Vice President Mike Pence, who was standing behind him, Trump said: In just a few months and moments, I will say what we’ve done over a short period of time and what we’re going to be doing over the next six months will be incredible.  We’ve signed more bills -- and I’m talking about through the legislature -- than any president ever.  For a while, Harry Truman had us, and now I think we have everybody, Mike.  I better say ""think,"" otherwise they’ll give me a Pinocchio -- (laughter) -- and I don’t like those -- I don’t like Pinocchios.   The data In April 2017, at the 100-day mark of his presidency, Trump had signed 28 bills into law. That was the most since the 55 signed into law by Democratic President Harry Truman in 1949, after Truman was elected to his first full term.
