George Packer says despite U.S. investments, Baghdad still gets only five hours a day of electricity
","
During the round-table discussion on ABC's This Week on Aug. 8, 2010, the New Yorker's George Packer was asked to comment on Vice President Joe Biden's boast, ""I'm very optimistic about Iraq. I think it's going to be one of the great achievements of this administration."" 
""It's a bit much,"" Packer said, especially considering how few Democrats supported the troop surge that has been credited for turning the situation around in Iraq. And he warned not to paint too rosy a picture of Iraq as the president prepares to remove combat forces by the end of the month. 
""It has stabilized,"" Packer said. ""But let's not exaggerate what kind of Iraq we're going to be leaving as we leave in the next year and a half. I mean, we spent $10 billion on that country's electrical system. How many hours a day are there of electricity in Baghdad now? Five hours a day. It's better than it was three years ago; it's still a pretty intolerable level of daily life and violence for ordinary Iraqis."" 
Electricity has been one of the key indicators of the success of reconstruction in Iraq, so we decided to check Packer's claim that, despite the U.S. spending $10 billion on Iraq's electrical system, the capital city of Baghdad still only gets five hours of electricity a day. 
Packer told us he got his figures from an Aug. 1. 2010, story in the New York Times. The story, written by Steven Lee Myers under the headline ""A Benchmark of Progress, Electrical Grid Fails Iraqis"" states that, ""Iraq now has elections, a functioning, if imperfect, army and an oil industry on the cusp of a potential boom. Yet Baghdad, the capital, had five hours of electricity a day in July."" 
According to the story, electricity shortages -- caused in part by war, corruption and a dysfunctional government -- have led to disillusionment and discontent among many Iraqis and sparked violent protests this summer. 
In an e-mail, Myers said the source for the five-hours-per-day figure for Baghdad was an interview with the deputy minister of electricity in Baghdad, as well as quarterly reports put out by the Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction. Myers explained that the hours-per-day figure is a difficult number to pin down because it changes daily and by region, even by neighborhood. Some areas get as few as 1 or two hours of electricity a day in the summer, some get more. 
According to the Brookings Institution's latest Iraq Index, the average hours of electricity a day in Baghdad was 19.5 hours in March (15.5 hours in February), the most recent months for which data was provided. Part of the discrepancy is due to the time of year. Demand for electricity spikes in Iraq's hot summer months, but Brookings' figures show Baghdad's average available daily power supply consistently exceeding 10 hours since Aug., 2008. 
But Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction, Stuart W. Bowen Jr., warned not to put too much stock in any of the hours-per-day numbers. 
""The hours per day figure is something the embassy stopped trying to track three years ago,"" Bowen said. ""It is so difficult to assess and so unreliable."" 
At best, he said, the figure of five hours a day in Baghdad is anecdotal, ever-changing, and different from neighborhood to neighborhood. 
In the alternative, Bowen's office decided to stick to tracking the daily power output on the grid. Nationwide, the average daily electrical output hit an historic peak in June at 6,700 megawatts. The quarterly average, down 2 percent from this time last year, is still more than 50 percent higher than pre-war electricity levels. 
That good news, however, is tempered by the grid's inability to keep up with soaring demand for electricity, which has nearly doubled. New prosperity in Iraq has increased access to goods that demand power. In addition, the country has failed to effectively manage demand through appropriate fees, Bowen said. Iraq charges very little for electricity, he said, and those fees are not effectively enforced, so Iraqis practically get their electricity for free. As a result, even with additional electricity purchased from neighboring nations, Iraq's electric supply meets just 62 percent of the demand. 
Packer's point about the tenuous future of electricity supply in Iraq is valid. As the U.S. begins its withdrawal of troops from Iraq, a number of serious challenges face the Iraqi government with regard to supplying electricity. The country needs to develop an automated distribution system, in part to stem some of the political manipulation of electricity distribution, Bowen said. It also needs to better maintain and oversee available electricity and better control unplanned outages plaguing the system. And the Iraqi government must jump-start and fund the behind-schedule ""MegaDeal"" purchases of dozens of turbines from General Electric and Siemens, which Bowen said would go a long way toward solving the country's electricity problems. 
Nonetheless, Bowen said, the U.S.'s investment in Iraq's electrical system has made a difference, as evidenced by the historic peak in electricity production in June. 
It's also important to note that, according to the July 2010 quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction, and confirmed by Bowen, the U.S.'s investment in Iraq's electrical system has to date been $5 billion, not the $10 billion cited by Packer on Meet the Press. 
So in his remarks Packer doubled the amount of money spent on the power grid. Also, although the Brookings numbers only go through March, they put the average daily power supply in Baghdad at more than twice as high as Packer's number. While the five hours a day figure may have been an accurate anecdotal snapshot during the month of July, experts say any figure is highly speculative. As a result, we rate Packer's claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/10/george-packer/george-packer-says-despite-us-investments-baghdad-/

Rep. John Boehner proposes U.S. stop stimulus spending
","
In an NBC Meet the Press interview on Aug. 8, 2010, host David Gregory repeatedly questioned House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, about how Republicans would offset the cost of extending all of the Bush tax cuts, as they have proposed. 
Boehner said halting stimulus spending would be a good start. 
""Why don't we stop the stimulus spending?"" Boehner said. ""There's still about $400 billion or $500 billion of the stimulus plan that has not been spent. Why don't we stop it. It's not working."" 
White House officials disputed Boehner's numbers, as well as Boehner's use of the term ""unspent."" 
We checked the latest updated figures on stimulus spending at the government's website recovery.gov. Stimulus programs were divided into three sectors: tax breaks to individuals and businesses; projects such as new roads, bridges and high-speed rail; and payments to state governments for things such as hiring teachers and police officers and for services such as extended unemployment insurance and health coverage. 
As of Aug. 4, 2010, $223 billion of the promised $288 billion in tax relief had already been paid out, as had $132 billion of the budgeted $275 billion for projects and $140 billion of the $224 billion set aside in the stimulus for entitlements. That comes to $495 billion that has already gone out the door. 
There was $787 billion in the stimulus, so that leaves only $292 billion that hasn't yet been paid out by the government. So right off the bat, Boehner's $400 billion to $500 billion figure is much too high. 
Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Republican Leader, said Boehner was talking about spending cuts outlined by Reps. Paul Ryan and Jeb Hensarling (which Boehner referenced immediately prior in the interview) and ""must have transposed the $266 billion figure for the stimulus with the $396 billion total figure for TARP. Honest mistake."" 
Fair enough. That happens in live interviews. 
But we think it's misleading to refer to even that lower number as ""unspent"" stimulus, because much of the $292 billion has been obligated, even though it has not been paid out. 
Let's start with the tax cuts. Most of them are being paid out gradually over a two-year period. For example, the Making Work Pay cuts (a refundable credit of up to $400 per individual and $800 per married couple) show up weekly in workers' paychecks. But it is not officially fully paid out until the program expires. White House officials contend these tax cuts aren't ""unspent"" because people are expecting to get their tax cuts.

The term ""unspent"" becomes even more suspect when talking about the stimulus projects. Recovery Act awardees don’t pay contractors up front for work on infrastructure projects. They usually make progress payments and withhold final payment until the project is completed. But the money is obligated and under contract. 
According to Recovery.gov, about 80 percent ($215 billion) of the project funds have been awarded and are under contract and agreement. Most are currently underway. Another $25 billion has been awarded but isn’t under contract yet. And the final $25 billion is in the process of being awarded. 
So it would be possible to put the brakes on some of the stimulus funding, though it would likely anger folks who have received awards or who are well into the process of applying for awards. But there's not nearly as much unspent -- and that could conceivably be used to offset the expense of extending the Bush tax cuts -- as Boehner suggested. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2010/aug/10/john-boehner/rep-john-boehner-proposes-us-stop-stimulus-spendin/
"['Federal Budget', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio tackles earmarks
","
In his bid for the U.S. Senate, Republican Marco Rubio has unveiled multiple proposals to reduce federal spending, including calling for an end to congressional earmarks. In an Aug. 3, 2010, campaign video, he said:

""The practice of earmarks in Congress is really one that lends itself to sort of corruption. It allows for all sorts of dealmaking like what they did with Obamacare to get it passed. But more insidious about it is the fact that these projects are funded without any public oversight, without the attention they deserve. In fact, powerful legislators are able to secure millions and millions of dollars for their home districts at the expense of the rest of the country. It's wrong. .... If we ban the practice of earmarks, we could save the American taxpayer anywhere between $15 (billion) to $20 billion dollars a year in pork-barrel spending."" 
In this Truth-O-Meter item, we wanted to explore whether Rubio cited the correct figure: do earmarks add up to $15 (billion) to $20 billion a year? We are not going to evaluate whether all these projects equal ""pork-barrel spending."" We can find definitions of ""earmarks"" but ""pork-barrel spending"" is an opinion. We decided to look at the most recent three years worth of earmarks because Rubio's campaign sent us sources that pertained to the current fiscal year and the previous two years.

Rubio campaign spokesman Alex Burgos directed us to Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan watchdog group that aims to reduce wasteful spending. The group concluded in a Feb. 17, 2010, report that earmarks added up to about $15.9 billion for fiscal year 2010. Taxpayers for Common Sense has analyzed earmarks since 2004.

TCS has a handy Q&A on its website, which defines earmarks as ""legislative provisions that set aside funds within an account for a specific program, project, activity, institution, or location. These measures normally circumvent merit-based or competitive allocation processes and appear in spending, authorization, tax, and tariff bills.""

TCS concluded there were $18.3 billion of congressional earmarks for fiscal year 2008, $17.9 billion for fiscal year 2009, and $15.9 billion for 2010.

It's possible to find different totals for earmarks depending upon which entity anyalzes them because of varying definitions of earmarks, according to TCS. So we decided to look at earmark amounts provided by the federal government.

We contacted the Office of Management and Budget. The OMB's website has a link to congressional earmarks, which showed about $16.6 billion for 2008, $15.3 billion for 2009 and $11.1 billion for 2010. The OMB, which obtains its information about earmark amounts from federal agencies, provided this definition: ""The Administration defines 'earmarks' as 'funds provided by the Congress for projects, programs, or grants where the purported congressional direction (whether in statutory text, report language, or other communication) circumvents otherwise applicable merit-based or competitive allocation processes, or specifies the location or recipient, or otherwise curtails the ability of the executive branch to manage its statutory and constitutional responsibilities pertaining to the funds allocation process.'"" 
It's worth noting that when it comes to spending cuts, earmarks are a very thin slice of the overall budget. In fiscal year 2010, consolidated federal government outlays  (including Social Security trust funds and the postal service) totaled more than $3,720 billion while earmarks were about $11.1 billion, according to OMB. 
We also contacted the Congressional Research Service to ask for its conclusions about earmark amounts in recent years. CRS spokeswoman Janine D'Addario told us that since CRS works exclusively for Congress and its staff, it would not provide an employee to interview on the record for attribution. CRS also would not provide a copy of the earmark report for us to post, but D'Addario gave us the name of the report and suggested that we obtain it from a member of Congress. (To provide readers full disclosure, PolitiFact Florida gathers information through on-the-record interviews and posts links to data.) U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson's office sent us a copy of the CRS report, ""Earmarks Disclosed by Congress: FY2008-FY2010 Regular Appropriations Bills.""

That reports shows in Table 6 that the total amount of congressional earmarks disclosed by Congress and requested by Congress was $12.5 billion in fiscal year 2008, $12 billion in fiscal year 2009 and $10.1 billion in fiscal year 2010.

We asked Steve Ellis, TCS vice president, how his organization could reach a different conclusion regarding the amount of earmarks than OMB and CRS.

""CRS takes as gospel what Congress says is an earmark. The House and Senate don't always agree on what is an earmark. So some things will be disclosed as an earmark in the Senate, the same item will not be disclosed in the House, and in the final bill is not disclosed,"" Ellis said. At OMB, ""they task each agency to actually review their appropriations and to tell them what earmarks were in their bills.""

We also asked Meg Reilly, an OMB spokesperson, how different entities could reach varying conclusions regarding the amount of earmarks. 
""It’s true that OMB collects data from federal agencies annually on earmarks in appropriations bills for reporting on earmarks.gov,"" she wrote in an e-mail. ""We can’t speak on behalf of CRS or TCS, but their definition of earmarks may be different, which could account for a difference in numbers.""

So how do Rubio's numbers stack up?

Rubio claimed that the total of earmarks was between $15 (billion) and $20 billion. During his video, Rubio did not explain what years he was referring to for that amount but his campaign provided information about fiscal years 2008 through 2010. Taxpayers for Common Sense concluded that the amounts were between $15.9 billion to $18.3 billion for the past three years -- all within Rubio's range. The Office of Management and Budget concluded the amounts were $11.1 billion, $15.3 billion and $16.6 billion -- so two of the three were within Rubio's range. So far, Rubio is scoring five out of six here. The CRS Congressional earmarks ranged from $10.1 billion to $12.5 billion -- all below Rubio's estimate. But since Rubio was within range for most of the OMB and Taxpayers for Common Sense figures, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/10/marco-rubio/rubio-tackles-earmarks/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Military', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Gen. Peter Chiarelli']","
U.S. Army report documents problem of suicides in the military.
","
Leaders of the U.S. Army need to take more active steps to prevent a growing number of soldiers from committing suicide, according to a major study released by the Army. Gen. Peter Chiarelli discussed the study on This Week with Christiane Amanpour.

The study documented complex pressures -- including overly long deployments, more tolerance for high-risk behavior among soldiers and lax standards for leaders keeping tabs on their soldiers.

Another complicating factor: increased use of prescription antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs and pain medications.

""We know that we had over 106,000 soldiers last year who had a prescription of three weeks or more for some kind of antidepressant, anti-anxiety medicine,"" said Chiarelli.

A few moments later, he added, ""A portion of those 106,000 soldiers that I told you are on some kind of pain medication, it has nothing to do with a behavior health issue. There are soldiers who have been on two, three, four deployments, hucking a rucksack filled with equipment that may weigh 70 to 80 pounds at 8,000 feet, and they've got a knee injury or a leg injury that is painful. Probably should stay home and get operated on, but they go back for the second deployment, and they're on some kind of a pain medication. We have soldiers who suck it up all the time and hide from their leaders when they're hurt.""

Chiarelli was referring to information in the Army's Health Promotion, Risk Reduction, and Suicide Prevention Report, released Aug. 5, 2010. This seemed like an important issue to explore further.

The report explains that historically, the Army's suicide rate has been much lower than the civilian population's. But the Army's rate began increasing in 2004 and surpassed the national average in 2008. That year, the suicide rate in the Army was 20.2 per 100,000, compared with a typical civilian rate of 19.2. This increase prompted the study.

""In Fiscal Year (FY) 2009, 160 active duty Soldiers took their lives, making suicide the third leading cause of death among the Army population,"" the study states. ""If we include accidental death, which frequently is the result of high risk behavior (drinking and driving, drug overdose, etc.), we find that less young men and women die in combat than die by their own actions. Simply stated, we are often more dangerous to ourselves than the enemy.""

The report affirms the 106,000 number that Chiarelli uses. ""Latest accounts estimate that approximately 106,000 Soldiers are prescribed some form of pain, depression or anxiety medications. The potential for abuse is obvious,"" it states.

The report also discusses whether these and other prescription drugs are being abused by members of the military:

""There is concern that potential prescription drug abuse is masked in our current system. This is the result of the increase in prescriptions which expands the population authorized to use pharmaceuticals. For example, the growing population who has obtained prescriptions for amphetamines has resulted in an increased rate of authorized use. Unfortunately, there is no definitive method to ascertain if the use was authorized or illicit. As a result, we have masked a subset of that population who are either dependent or illicitly use drugs. Ultimately, if left unchecked, this gap facilitates a population of drug addicts and distributors.""

The report also notes that many soldiers are aged 18 to 29, and there are continuing questions about the use of antidepressants -- specifically, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) -- among young people, and whether these medications sometimes increase the risk of suicide. ""The Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) is cognizant of this issue and is investigating the use of these and other medications to better manage care,"" the report states.

The report makes additional observations about prescription drug users in the military. Pain medications seem to be more common than antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs; ""14% of the force is taking some form of opiate medication,"" according to the report.  The percentage for antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications appear somewhat lower, with between 3 and 6 percent of the deployed force receiving such medication, according to evidence the report cites. Anecdotal evidence in the report indicates some soldiers receive multiple prescriptions for pain and depression.

We should emphasize the study draws no hard conclusions about the role that prescription drugs play in military suicides. ""The impact of increased use of antidepressant, psychiatric and narcotic pain management medications has not been comprehensively studied in a military population,"" the report states.

In the interview with Amanpour, Chiarelli rejected the idea that soldiers were overly medicated. ""We know that the drugs that we're talking about are cleared by the CENTCOM surgeon for soldiers to be taking when they're downrange. So we're not sending any soldier into harm's way who is taking a drug that we feel would somehow endanger him or others,"" he said.

Finally, we should note that the report links policing potential drug addiction to military leadership in a section titled ""The Lost Art of Leadership in Garrison."" The Army has been transformed in recent years, the report states, so that combat readiness has been emphasized more than ""good order and discipline practices."" Unannounced health and welfare checks and inspections ""have been lost"" as part of that transition. ""There are instances where a leader’s lack of Soldier accountability resulted in suicide victims not being found until they had been dead for three or four weeks,"" the report noted.

While the report raises a host of issues, we're only ruling on what the general said about the rate of medication among soldiers. The Army report and other testimony that we found support Chiarelli's statement that approximately 106,000 soldiers had ""a prescription of three weeks or more"" for pain, depression or anxiety medication. We rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/10/gen-peter-chiarelli/us-army-report-documents-problem-suicides-military/

Sen. George Voinovich critical that half the national debt is held by foreign investors
","
Want to invest in U.S. Treasury notes? Step right up, alongside China, Japan, the United Kingdom and the rest of the world.

While a sign of faith in the stability of the U.S. dollar, all this money from foreigners also worries some people. They say the nearly $4 trillion worth of U.S. government securities held by foreign investors shows how deeply our government must borrow to sustain itself – and if the foreign investors want out, they could harm our economy.

U.S. Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio is among the worriers, and he blames this government’s inability to stop spending. As he said on the floor of the Senate on July 14, ""Last year, we borrowed $1.4 trillion -- or 41 cents of every dollar we spent. Over half of this debt is held by foreign investors.""

Has the share of debt to foreigners really gotten that big? If you use a widely accepted estimate agreed to by economists, yes.

How worrisome that is, and why, is another matter.

The debt to which he refers is not just from last year’s $1.4 trillion budget deficit. The debt is the total of all outstanding borrowing. Think of it like a 30-year home mortgage of $150,000 and a home equity loan of $25,000. The total debt would be $175,000 plus interest, even if only $1,200 a month, or $14,400, was due this year.

Total U.S. government debt as of July 30 was nearly $13.25 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.

But about $4.5 trillion of that debt is what’s called ""intragovernmental holdings"" -- money loaned from one government agency to another. This includes money that the Social Security trust fund loaned to the Treasury for general government operations that eventually will have to be repaid.

Economists often exclude intragovernmental holdings when discussing the public debt, because their bigger concern is the other portion -- $8.7 trillion – that will have to be repaid to outside parties. The government gets that money from investors -- individuals, companies, mutual funds and foreign countries -- in exchange  for interest-bearing bills, notes and bonds from the Treasurery Department.

This ""Debt Held By the Public"" is what Voinovich was referring to when he said that ""over half this debt is held by foreign investors.""

So how is his math?

If you want precision, it’ll depend on which report you are examining. According to Treasury Department information that is updated monthly, foreigners held $3.96 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities at the end of May (the most recent month reported). The total debt to the public was nearly $8.5 trillion. So foreign ownership of U.S. debt equaled 47 percent if you use the May data.

Voinovich’s aides said the senator used slightly different numbers from a quarterly Treasury report from the end of March. It listed foreign and international ownership of U.S. Treasury securities at $3.88 trillion. At the time, total public debt was listed as $7.5 trillion. That meant 52 percent of the public debt was held by foreign investors.

Given the daily swings in market valuation and debt, changes in foreign countries’ investments, and even small changes in the way that different Treasury documents account for holdings, it makes little difference if the right figure is 47 percent of 52 percent. Voinovich is basically correct.

Likewise, even though Voinovich’s claim excluded the portion of national debt that comprises intragovernmental holdings, economists say his framework is widely accepted.

""I don’t think he was straying from conventional usage in saying that,"" said Andrew Biggs, a resident scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute.

Where are these foreign investors from? China represented 22 percent of the foreign holders at the end of May, with $867.7 billion, followed by Japan ($786.7 billion, or 20 percent), the United Kingdom ($350 billion, or 9 percent) and oil exporting countries ($235.1 billion, or 6 percent).

Economists and politicians sometimes dispute what would happen if these investors suddenly cashed in their investments. Theoretically it could harm the value of the U.S. dollar, require higher interest rates to attract new investors, lead to high inflation and drive up the cost of consumer goods for Americans..

But that could hurt the value of their investments in a sell-off. And a weaker American dollar would make American goods more affordable overseas while foreign goods got more expensive here. That’s not what countries selling to American consumers want, economists say.

That doesn’t mean the current level of debt is insignificant, and the subject consumes a great deal of this year’s political debate. The foreign-ownership component leaves a number if ""what-ifs"" on which people disagree.

But we found that Voinovich’s numbers are basically sound, and economists we talked to agreed it’s fine for Voinovich to cite only the publicly held debt for his comparison.

We rate Voinovich’s claim that half the national debt is held by foreign investors as True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/10/george-voinovich/sen-george-voinovich-critical-half-national-debt-h/

MARTA is the sole major transit system that never received ""significant, dedicated"" funding from state, Chairman said
","
The Metropolitan Atlanta Regional Transit Authority has said repeatedly that it doesn't get enough money from the state.

And unlike any major system in the United States, the money it does receive is far from a sure thing, its advocates have said. Georgia law does not require that the state set aside funds for MARTA.

Michael W. Tyler, MARTA's chairman, made the claim once again in a June 9 op-ed piece that appeared in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He argued that MARTA has done well with limited resources.

""[U]nlike every other major transit system in the nation, MARTA has never received any significant, dedicated funding from the state of Georgia,"" Tyler said.

But is it true? We asked MARTA to back up its claim.

MARTA spokesman Lyle Harris explained that during the past 15 years, the agency has consistently received about $2 million annually from the General Assembly for capital expenses, such as the cost of replacing buses or other infrastructure.

But this money is not dedicated to MARTA. ""Dedicated"" funds are monies that must, by state law, go to a specific purpose. Because this money isn't dedicated, MARTA must ask the state Legislature for money every year. This makes it hard for MARTA to plan its budgets.

This isn't MARTA's only funding problem, Harris said. While the $2 million is important to the agency, it's only a drop in the bucket. MARTA's capital budget is usually larger than $250 million.

Furthermore, Harris said, MARTA receives no dedicated operating funding from the state or money to run the system day to day. Harris provided PolitiFact Georgia a spreadsheet with operating funds data from the Federal Transit Administration's National Transit Database (NTD), which collects information on the country's transit systems. The data were from 2008, the most recent year available.

They showed that MARTA was the country's ninth-largest transit system by ""unlinked passenger trips"" in 2008, a commonly used measure that counts each time a passenger boards a MARTA vehicle.

But the data didn't back up MARTA's claim. Instead, the federal data it sent show that MARTA is a very large agency that receives no operating funds from the state. That, however, is not the same thing as being the only major transit system that receives no dedicated state funding, as Tyler said.

We did our own check, which revealed one transit system larger than MARTA that does not receive state-dedicated operating or capital funds: the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.

The WMATA operates trains and buses in the Washington, D.C., area and is the fourth-largest transit system in the country. It is nearly three times the size of MARTA by unlinked passenger trips. Federal data, an agency spokesman and a scholar with the Brookings Institution who has studied the Washington system confirm it does not receive state-dedicated operating funds or capital funds.

Still, the WMATA receives far more state funding than MARTA does. According to 2008 data, 18 percent of its operating funds came from Maryland and Virginia, or more than $250 million.

MARTA received no state funding for operations that year, federal data show.

Harris argues that MARTA's situation is unique. When the WMATA asks for state money, it receives hundreds of millions of dollars. MARTA doesn't get anything close to this type of funding from Georgia, Harris said.

""Whether we ask or not, we don't get anything akin to what WMATA is getting,"" Harris said.

That may be correct, but that's not what Tyler said. His op-ed argued that MARTA is the only major transit agency in the country that receives no ""significant, dedicated"" funding from the state. Not that it's barely getting anything from the state or that state funding makes up only a tiny percentage of its budget.

"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'John Carter']","
Rep. John Carter says United States is the only nation affording citizenship to anyone born here
","
U.S. Rep. John Carter told reporters Monday he's sympathetic to concerns simmering in some circles over the first part of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which holds that ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens.""

At issue: Whether providing citizenship for being born on U.S. soil makes sense amid turmoil over illegal immigration.

In Monday’s conference call, organized by the Republican National Committee to generate heat over President Barack Obama's in-and-out visit to Texas, Carter went on to say the United States ""may be, or probably (is) the only nation in the world that has a provision where if you are born in our country, no matter whether you are here legally or illegally, you are still considered a United States citizen."" Asked about his comment a moment later, Carter didn't hedge; he said he thinks it's correct that ""we are the only country in the world that affords citizenship"" to children born to parents illegally in the country when their child is born here.

If so, Carter, R-Round Rock, thinks wrong — as PolitiFact National concluded about a similar June 2009 statement by conservative pundit Glenn Beck, rating False Beck's statement that we're the only country in the world that has automatic citizenship for individuals born here.

Citing a list posted online by NumbersUSA, a group that favors reducing immigration into the United States, PolitiFact wrote: ""We might be inclined to cut Beck some slack if the only other countries were Saint Lucia, Antigua and Lesotho. In fact, we'll even admit that we had to look up what continent Lesotho is even on (Africa). But Canada, Brazil, Romania? We didn't have to go looking for those. It might be surprising to Americans that automatic citizenship isn't more common in the developed world, but the bottom line is Beck made a blanket statement that is just wrong.""

This wrap up our Carter review?

Not quite. Bill Riggs, the RNC's spokesman, telephoned after Monday's call and said Carter means the United States is ""one of the few industrialized nations"" that afford citizenship for anyone born here. When we reached Carter's communications director, John Stone, he said likewise.

Stone followed up with an e-mail stating that 34 nations allow birthright citizenship.

""Note the lack of all major Western industrialized nations with the exception of Canada. None of the nations of the European Union (or the countries of) Japan or China recognize birthright citizenship,"" Stone’s e-mail said. ""These facts confirm Congressman's Carter's frequent statement that the United States is one of the few nations that allow birthright citizenship.""

Stone didn't immediately say how he came up with the list. Separately, we reached Jon Feere, legal policy analyst for the Center for Immigration Studies, which has studied the costs of illegal immigration. Feere said he's completing a report on birthright citizenship including a breakdown of, to this point, 27 nations that grant automatic citizenship to children born to illegal residents. Feere said he built his list based on conversations with foreign government officials.

Canada has automatic birthright citizenship, according to Feere's breakdown, while Mexico provides for automatic Mexican ""nationality."" Latin and South American nations predominate on the list;. they include Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela.

Feere said in an e-mail: ""No European country has such a policy. The only advanced economies in the world with birthright citizenship policies are the United States and Canada."" He pointed us to the International Monetary Fund's classification of nation's economies as advanced, emerging and developing countries, demonstrating that the only nations with advanced economies that provide for birthright citizenship are Canada and the United States.

So, how does Carter's statement come out?

As researched by PolitiFact in 2009, Carter's initial statement (which he reaffirmed) that the United States is the only nation that provides citizenship to children born here regardless of their parents' immigration status is incorrect. Yet the RNC’s Riggs quickly amended Carter’s statement to say he means the United States is among a few industrial nations with such a provision; that's accurate.

It’s good that the GOP spokesman reeled back on the congressman’s mistake. Still, we rate Carter's initial statement False.",/factchecks/2010/aug/10/john-carter/rep-john-carter-says-united-states-only-nation-aff/

Bill McCollum says Florida police can check the immigration status of people they arrest
","
The red-hot topic of immigration came up again in the Aug. 5, 2010, debate between Bill McCollum and Rick Scott, the Republican candidates for governor.

Referencing Rick Scott's May 2010 TV ad about the need for stronger immigration laws, Bill McCollum alleged that Scott doesn't understand the state laws already on the books.

""As the next governor of Florida, you're going to pass a law that allows police, when they make an arrest, to be able to find out if somebody has been here illegally. That shows an ignorance of Florida law. Currently, police officers in this state have that right already. What Arizona has is a mandate that says when you're stopped, detained, or arrested, police officers shall check to see whether you're legal or illegal. I favor that law for Florida, I favor the Arizona immigration law,"" McCollum said.

PolitiFact Florida has already reviewed Scott's explanation of the law (Half True) and McCollum's shifting support for it (Full Flop). This time, we want to check the claim that Florida police officers are able to check the immigration status of individuals who have been arrested.

Turns out, McCollum is right. On June 29, 2010, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement announced that law enforcement officials in all 67 Florida counties will now have access to the biometrics-based immigration records in the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT), a database maintained by the Department of Homeland Security. Police officers will be able to run the fingerprints of individuals they arrest through the database to identify both lawful and unlawful aliens. Previously, police officers were only able to use the fingerprints to check the individuals' criminal history through a database maintained by the FBI.

ICE explained the process in a press release: ""If any fingerprints match those of someone in the DHS biometric system, the new automated process notifies ICE. ICE evaluates each case to determine the individual's immigration status and takes appropriate enforcement action. This includes aliens who are in lawful status and those who are present without lawful authority. Once identified through fingerprint matching, ICE will respond with a priority placed on aliens convicted of the most serious offenses first -- such as those with convictions for major drug offenses, murder, rape and kidnapping.""

The program is part of ICE's Secure Communities initiative, a plan that ""improves public safety by implementing a comprehensive, integrated approach to identify and remove criminal aliens from the United States,"" according to the ICE website. As of June 2010, 23 states participated in the program, and ICE plans to make the system available nationwide by 2013.

So McCollum is correct. Florida police officers are able to check the immigration status of those who are arrested.

Still, after reviewing McCollum's comment and the Rick Scott ad that he referenced in more detail, we should probably provide some more clarification to our readers.

First, the ad. According to the narrator, ""Arizona is tackling the problem of illegal immigration, but Bill McCollum rejects the Arizona approach."" The ad then goes on to say that ""Rick Scott backs Arizona's law. He'll bring it to Florida, and let our police check if the people they arrest are here legally. That's common sense.""

As we said above, Florida already allows its police officers to ""check if the people they arrest are here legally."" But the Arizona immigration law actually requires police officers to do much more than that. As we explained in the previous item, Arizona's law allows people to be questioned if they are lawfully stopped or questioned for any reason, whether it's a traffic stop, or a municipal violation like letting your grass grow too tall in a community that requires frequent mowing. In other words, Arizona police officers are required to check an individual's immigration status even if that individual is not under arrest.

That is not the case in Florida. Heather Smith, a press representative from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, told us in an e-mail that the agency is not aware of any court ruling or a legal opinion issued by the Florida Attorney General's office that ""specifically prohibits an inquiry of an individual’s immigration status"" during an investigative encounter. In other words, Florida police officers can, in theory, check the immigration status of someone pulled over for a traffic stop, but there is currently nothing in state law that would require them to do so. Implementing Arizona's law in Florida, as Scott and McCollum both favor, would change that. 
We also considered the counter argument that Scott's ad went up in May of this year, several weeks before the joint ICE and FDLE announcement, so McCollum's implication that Scott does not understand Florida law would not have been valid at the time. Smith told us, however, that Florida police officers have always had the ability to check an arrested individual's immigration record. Before the implementation of the Secure Communities initiative, however, they had to rely on named-based checking. The new ICE program uses ""state of the art technology"" and allows police officers to use digital fingerprint data for a more accurate determination. 
Finally, we must note that on July 28, 2010, Judge Susan Bolton of Federal District Court issued a preliminary injunction against parts of the Arizona law -- including the requirement that we discuss above. The injunction prevents certain provisions of the law from going into effect. Bolton wrote in her ruling that immigration falls under the jurisdiction of the federal government and that ""there is a substantial likelihood that officers will wrongfully arrest legal resident aliens."" 
To recap. McCollum says that Scott's ad ""shows an ignorance of Florida law,"" because Florida police officers already have the right to check the immigration status of those who are arrested. We found that implementing an Arizona-style mandate would change existing immigration enforcement laws in the state. Currently, there is no law requiring Florida police to check the status of those who are lawfully stopped or detained, but there is nothing that would prevent them from doing so. Still, our focus in this fact-check is McCollum's claim about individuals who are already arrested, and with that, he is on solid ground. We rate this True.

"['Ohio', 'Crime', 'Mike DeWine']","
GOP challenger Mike DeWine says BCI tests delayed 'up to 6 months' under Cordray
","
A ""tough on crime"" reputation plays well on the campaign trail for Ohio attorney general candidates. It worked wonders for former Republican Attorney General Betty Montgomery, who won two terms in the 1990s by talking a big game about the law enforcement functions of the office.

So as Democratic Attorney General Richard Cordray and his Republican challenger, Mike DeWine, battle to become Ohio's top lawyer for the next four years, both desire to be seen as the better choice for handling the law enforcement portion of the office.

On DeWine's campaign website, the former prosecutor calls safety and crime prevention his top priority should he be elected. And DeWine hammers on Cordray for what he sees as inefficiency in the processing of DNA crime evidence at the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (BCI), a branch of the AG's office.

""There are currently delays of up to six months in the processing of DNA evidence at the state run crime lab,"" DeWine states on his campaign website.

We decided to check out DeWine’s statement to see if the BCI lab was really taking ""up to"" six months to process DNA evidence.

Cordray's office told us that many factors play a role in how long it takes for results to come back.

Cases where someone has been arrested, will jump ahead of cases where no one has been jailed, pushing back wait times for non-prioritized cases. Also, ""case types that involve violence against a person are normally worked ahead of less violent case types,"" according to an e-mail from Cordray’s office.

BCI statistics provided by Cordray’s office show a small portion of DNA cases cases do drag on ""up to six months"" and even longer. Those records also show, though, that it's far from typical. The average turnaround time in processing DNA evidence has dropped from 100 days in 2009 to 71 days in 2010.

The credit goes to increased staffing resulting from filling ""several"" vacancies in the crime lab as well as increased use of robotics in processing the DNA evidence, according to Cordray's office. They also acknowledge that some of the DNA work is being sent to outside labs when, they say, more advanced and sophisticated testing is needed.  (DeWine's campaign agrees that the average DNA evidence turnaround time is dropping in 2010, but it says that more work is being outsourced as a ploy to lower Cordray's statistics.)

Sixty-five of 854 current DNA cases -- 7.6 percent -- have gone beyond the ""up to"" six months mark cited by DeWine. Of those 65 cases, 62 involve work being done by outside laboratories, which Cordray's office argues shouldn't count on their tally.

We also asked DeWine's campaign for evidence of ""up to"" six month delays. They pointed us to a trio of examples detailed in media reports.

We tossed out one because the case predated Cordray's time in office by six months.

The second was described March 26, 2010, in the Marietta Times. The article describes how the arrest of a suspect in the rape of a college student was delayed for nearly a year because of a backlog at the BCI lab.

Acting Chief Jim Weaver of the Marietta College police confirmed that ""we got our match right around a year from when we gave the sample."" The DNA evidence was sent to BCI on April 3, 2009, and returned to his office on March 16, 2010.

Weaver, the lead detective on the case, said BCI officials told him the 50-week delay was because ""we didn't have anyone in custody and we didn't need it to keep anyone in jail, so it kept getting pushed back.""

The third example from a WTOL-TV report May 3, 2010, focused on a lengthy delay in DNA evidence processing in the murder of 91-year-old Grace Kennedy in Bryan, Ohio.

Bryan police Capt. Paul Zawodny told us that the crime scene DNA evidence was received by BCI just hours after the Dec. 23, 2009, murder was discovered. The first DNA results came back April 5, 2010, a span of about four and a half months, Zawodny said.

The officer said part of the reason for the lag time was that prosecutors had to give the BCI lab permission to use all of a suspect's DNA sample while doing the testing.

DeWine's campaign sought to bolster its case by putting us into contact with Union County Prosecutor David Phillips, a Republican, who said that DNA evidence has recently taken longer than six months to be processed by BCI.

""On average, we are waiting a long time -- sometimes even over a year for DNA evidence -- and during that time the case is just sitting there,"" Phillips said. The county prosecutor since 2005, Phillips said ""I wouldn't say it's gotten any worse under Cordray's watch, but I wouldn't say it's gotten any better.""

Phillips said his most recent DNA evidence-based case was a rape case where a suspect had been arrested, triggering a 90-day clock (about three months) under the constitutional provision for a speedy trial. He said he was on the phone ""a lot"" pressing the BCI lab to meet the 90-day window, which they did by only 10 days causing his office ""anxiety"" that the deadline would be missed freeing the suspect.

We find that DeWine’s statement  is accurate when he states that the processing of DNA evidence is currently taking ""up to six months,"" as at least the Marietta example far exceeds that window. Even Cordray's own statistics show that processing of DNA evidence stretches beyond six months in about 7 percent of cases, including at least three cases not shipped to an outside lab.

But the BCI statistics Cordray’s office provided show that more than 90 times in 100 the processing time falls somewhat short of ""up to"" six month mark cited by DeWine. Cordray’s staff also cites records that show that the turnaround time has dropped by about one-third. That's clearly additional contextual information not given by DeWine that tends to undercut the clear inference of his statement -- that DNA cases are dragging on for long stretches of time under Cordray.

Therefore, we rate DeWine's statement that DNA evidence is currently taking up to six months to be processed by the BCI crime lab to be Half True.

Rick Perry says Bill White profiteered in hurricane's aftermath
","
A headline on one of GOP Gov. Rick Perry’s campaign websites underscores Perry’s criticism of Democratic nominee Bill White’s business dealings. White, the headline on liberalbill.org says, ""profiteered in the aftermath of Hurricane Rita."" 
That's a powerful charge -- worthy fodder for the Truth-O-Meter. 
First, let’s check ""profiteer,"" which means someone ""who makes excessive profits, especially by taking advantage of a shortage of supply to charge exorbitant prices,"" according to Webster’s New World College Dictionary. The verb simply means to be a profiteer. Robert Prentice, a professor at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, told us the word applies to someone who overcharges in instances of short supply or who simply seeks excess profits. 
In a nutshell, Perry’s campaign says White profiteered after the hurricane hit the Gulf Coast near the Texas-Louisiana line in September 2005 because, it says, he had financial connections — before and while he was mayor — with a company that got an emergency contract to provide six electrical generators to a Houston-area water authority for three months. 
In a June 10, 2010, press conference, White, who was mayor of Houston from 2004 through 2009, countered that he had no financial interest in the company -- BTEC Turbines -- at the time of the storm and hadn’t acted improperly when he encouraged the company to pitch in for the Coastal Water Authority, which supplies water to Houston, Baytown and Deer Park and dozens of industrial customers. (Its board of directors has seven members -- four appointed by the mayor of Houston and three by the governor.) 
The total amount paid by the authority to BTEC: about $1.9 million. The Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursed the authority for nearly all the money spent on the generator contract, which was needed after the storm knocked out power to a pump station that sends water from the Trinity River to a reservoir near Baytown. 
White spoke on the issue a day after personal income tax returns he released showed that he later made hundreds of thousands of dollars from investing in the Houston company. 
Don Moore, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California-Berkeley, said that for White's post-hurricane investment in BTEC to be interpreted as profiteering, White would have had to know two things in fall 2005: that he would join the investment in BTEC ""in the near future"" and that the firm's contract with the authority would ""increase the sweetness"" of that deal. Katy Bacon, spokeswoman for White's campaign, said he did not have advance knowledge of the investment opportunity. 
We scoured documents cited by Perry’s campaign, minutes from Coastal Water Authority board meetings and a packet of documents provided by Vinson & Elkins, the authority’s outside lawyers, for indications that either BTEC or White acted as profiteers from the emergency contract. 
What we found: Two members of the authority’s board of directors, Darryl King and Rick Cloutier, questioned the contract costs at the board’s October 2005 meeting. According to board minutes, Cloutier said the generators could be purchased for the same cost as renting them. The authority has since made a plan to buy back-up generators. 
On Aug. 4, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Mayor White later encouraged the authority to settle up with BTEC after the authority disputed some charges that it thought were too high. A final payment was arranged about eight months before White invested in BTEC. The authority ended up paying BTEC about $264,000 of more than $424,000 in disputed charges, according to the AP story. 
Cloutier, now a senior vice president with engineering and construction firm CDM in Houston, told us that after Rita hit, the board was pleased that the authority could get the equipment because ""it was awful hard to come across generators at that time."" He said the dispute between the authority and BTEC dealt with another aspect of the contract, the purchase and storage of diesel fuel that the authority didn't use because power was restored a few days after the storm. 
""It didn’t make sense to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for fuel and maintenance folks that we didn’t need,"" Cloutier said. 
So, why didn’t the authority end its BTEC deal as soon as power was restored? Cloutier said the board didn’t think that was an option. ""We were being held to the terms of the contract,"" he said. 
Clark Lord of Vinson & Elkins, an outside lawyer for the authority, declined to discuss generator costs. But John Agnes, a salesman for Mustang CAT, which sells generators in the Houston area, told us the $252,000 monthly generator rental charge in the authority’s BTEC contract is roughly equivalent to what his company would charge for providing such generators in a period of high demand. 
The rest of the authority’s costs, about $1.2 million, were associated with installation, supporting equipment, personnel and fuel. (In October 2005, the authority’s board backed a resolution approving the agreement with BTEC and said the costs were not to exceed $2 million.) 
Next, we explored White’s connections to BTEC both before and after the hurricane came ashore in September 2005. 
Perry’s campaign notes correctly that before becoming mayor, White served on BTEC’s board by virtue of his job as president and CEO of the Wedge Group, a private Houston investment company with interests in oil service companies, commercial real estate and hotels. The Wedge Group bought a 70 percent stake in BTEC in December 2001, according to a December 2001 Houston Business Journal report. 
After his election in 2003, White resigned from Wedge and the BTEC board. Wedge later severed its ties to BTEC; Richard Blohm, general counsel for the Wedge Group, told us that ""it has been a few years since we had any ownership interest at all."" 
How did White regain an interest in BTEC? In December 2006, White invested in BTEC through the Sterling Group, one of two private equity firms that bought a majority stake in the Houston company that year. Bacon told us that the Sterling Group contacted White to get his opinion about the company and White said he thought so highly of it that he would put his own money into it. The firm later took White up on that and invited him to invest, Bacon said. 
The AP reported Aug. 4 that White owns about 1 percent of BTEC. 
Through July 20, 2010, Bacon said, White had put $552,000 in cash and $324,480 in loans into the BTEC investment and received $1.25 million in cash back -- a gain of about $375,000. 
Perry’s ""profiteer"" case against White features two other financial connections -- a deferred-compensation account that was set up before White left Wedge in 2003 and payments White received from Wedge in 2005. 
Let’s look at the deferred-compensation account first. According to White’s personal tax returns from the years he was mayor, White received payments from the account each year from 2005 (about $82,000) through 2009 (about $84,000). 
Bacon told us the deferred-compensation account, held by a brokerage firm, was funded with income White earned while still at Wedge that was then invested in publicly traded stocks and mutual funds, not in BTEC or Wedge. She said the payments White received were not influenced by Wedge’s performance after 2003. 
What about the more than $3 million White reported receiving from Wedge in 2005? In a financial summary White released to reporters this year, that money is described as ""contractual payments"" based on gains from investments that White had managed for the company prior to 2004. Bacon told us none of the investments was related to BTEC. 
We checked back in with the Perry campaign about the profiteering charge. Spokesman Mark Miner said the history of White’s financial involvement with Wedge, BTEC and the 2005 authority contract proves White profiteered from Hurricane Rita. 
We disagree. Questions have certainly been raised about whether the authority paid too much for its deal with BTEC, but even if it did, that would serve as evidence that BTEC reaped excessive profits from the hurricane contract, not White. 
Whether White improperly intervened on behalf of BTEC to settle the contract matter is another issue, which isn't the statement we're reviewing. 
Upshot: White had a prior relationship with BTEC when he played a role in the company’s getting post-hurricane work and he later made what turned out to be a profitable investment in the company. 
Those decisions might open White to conflict-of-interest criticisms. However, Perry’s characterization of White as a profiteer doesn't bear out. We rate Perry's claim False.",/factchecks/2010/aug/09/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-bill-white-profiteered-hurricane-r/

Isakson warns the end of tax cuts will result in historic increase
","
In Washington, a simmering political battle is boiling over this hot summer. Some say it could hurt the checkbooks of virtually every American.

The topic is taxes, specifically what will happen if the tax cuts approved under the presidency of George W. Bush expire at the end of this year.

U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., offered his theory in a guest column in the July 28 edition of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

""Now, these tax cuts are set to expire on Dec. 31, and allowing them to do so will amount to the largest tax increase in the history of America,"" Isakson wrote.

Republicans are pushing to continue the tax cuts in all income categories. President Barack Obama has called for the cuts to end, but only for high-income Americans. The tax cuts would end for individuals making more than $200,000 and couples making more than $250,000. Many Democratic leaders in Congress have publicly stated they support the president's proposal.

Neither Democratic leaders nor Obama have said they want all of the tax cuts to expire.

Some loyal AJC PolitiFact Georgia readers asked us to investigate some of the claims in the column by Isakson, who is running for re-election this November against Democrat Michael Thurmond, Georgia's outgoing labor commissioner, and Libertarian Chuck Donovan. We decided to focus on the claim whether it does amount to the largest tax increase in U.S. history, since other politicians are repeating it.

PolitiFact's national website this week gave former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin a ""Pants on Fire"" ruling because she implied in a televised interview that eliminating the tax cuts for only high-income Americans would amount to the largest tax increase in U.S. history.

Isakson, however, was more inclusive in his statement, which assumed all of the Bush tax cuts for all income groups could be eliminated. His argument was different than Palin's.

Here's some background on the tax cuts. In 2001 and 2003, the Republican-led Congress approved a series of cuts that reduced the income tax rate in several categories. If the tax cuts expire, the 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent and 35 percent tax brackets will revert to 28 percent, 31 percent, 36 percent and 39.6 percent, respectively, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

Isakson's office argued in an e-mail to AJC PolitiFact Georgia three reasons its statement is correct. The senator's office says it's the largest in terms of dollar amount, the largest in terms of how many taxpayers are affected and largest in terms of revenue effect as a percentage of the national gross domestic product.

There's little research about the impact of ending the tax cuts in comparison with past tax increases or cuts.

Jim Nunns, a former U.S. Treasury Department official who is now a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, shared some Treasury data with AJC PolitiFact Georgia. He included a 2006 report called ""Revenue effects of major tax bills."" The report includes a chart that shows revenue estimates of tax increases and cuts as a percentage of the gross domestic product.

Most economists say that measuring taxes as a percentage of GDP is the most accurate way to compare tax increases that were passed years apart.

The measure takes into account how large the taxes are in relation to the economy in which they are levied, and it eliminates the effects of inflation.

The 1942 tax increase, approved to help fund America's fight during World War II, was 5 percent of the gross domestic product, according to Treasury Department data. Treasury officials say the end of all of the current tax cuts would result in 2 percent of the gross domestic product. Our own analysis also found it would be about 2 percent.

Isakson's office said the 1942 tax increase should be viewed with caution because the data are inconsistent with later tax information. The 2006 Treasury Department report says a consistent source of revenue estimates was not available for all bills between 1940 and 1967. Isakson's office believes the better comparison is to a tax increase in 1982 that resulted in 0.53 percent of the gross domestic product in the first year and 1.23 percent by the fourth year, according to its analysis of Congressional Budget Office data.

CBO estimates show allowing the three main provisions of the Bush administration tax cuts to expire would result in an additional $209.6 billion in fiscal year 2012 and $251.7 billion by fiscal year 2014. The 1942 tax increase resulted in billions coming in to federal tax coffers in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to the 2006 Treasury Department report. That total would be about $115 billion in today's dollars.

Nunns, of the Tax Policy Center, said it's fair to compare the 1942 tax increase with what would happen if the tax cuts expire. The 1942 estimate came from the Congressional Record, which is the official record of the U.S. Congress.

""If you look at the current dollar measure, you can see that would be an accurate statement,"" Nunns said of Isakson's statement. ""If you look at it from the size of the economy, then it's not.""

Georgia State University economics professor Sally Wallace said she worked with Nunns and Jerry Tempalski, the author of the 2006 Treasury Department report, and thinks it's fair to compare the 1942 tax increase with the end of the tax cuts.

""An overly conservative take on the early Treasury data would still lead to the conclusion that the 1942 act had a substantially larger impact on the economy, measured via GDP [than the end of the Bush administration tax cuts],"" said Wallace, chairwoman of the economics department.

The numbers show Isakson has a strong case that allowing these tax cuts to expire would result in more revenue than at any point in U.S. history. The senator's case concerning why it is a larger percentage of the gross domestic product than the 1942 tax increase is weaker. The 2006 Treasury Department report said a consistent source for the revenue estimates was not available. It did not say that the estimates were unreliable.

The GDP is considered a more accurate way to measure the economy. Isakson's statement is misleading when you base his statement on the GDP. Therefore, we rate his statement as Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/08/johnny-isakson/isakson-warns-end-tax-cuts-will-result-historic-in/

Pete Sessions: Federal government has gained 500,000 workers under Obama while private sector suffered
","
U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Dallas, sees a hole in President Barack Obama’s theme that the economy is on the mend.

""The numbers are stunning,"" Sessions said on the House floor July 30. ""Over the time that President Obama has been in office, we have lost 2.5 million free enterprise system jobs, and, yet, 500,000 federal government jobs have been added in that period of time. The assault on the common man of this country is unrelenting by the Democrat majority."" His criticism came to our attention on that evening’s ""PBS NewsHour.""

The private sector starves while Uncle Sam fattens up? We wanted more information.

In support of Sessions’ statement, his office guided us through employment statistics posted online by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Sure enough, between February 2009, Obama’s first full month in office, and June 2010, the number of private-sector jobs dropped from 110.3 million to 107.7 million, a decrease of nearly 2.7 million. In the same period, the number of federal government workers rose from 2,792,000 to 3,171,000, an increase of 379,000.

That’s not the 500,000 increase Sessions bemoans. Sessions’ chief of staff, Josh Saltzman, noted that federal jobs totaled about 3.4 million in May 2010, amounting to an increase of more than 600,000 since February 2009--making 500,000 a reasonable estimate of the increase in federal employees.

Next, we contacted the BLS for more detail on the employment numbers.

What we learned: Nearly all of the uptick in federal workers from early 2009 to June 2010 reflects temporary hires by the U.S. Census Bureau, which is conducting the constitutionally required census of U.S. residents.

Nathan Clausen, a bureau economist, provided a BLS report indicating that 6,000 census workers were employed in February 2009, a number that shot up to 564,000 in May 2010 before decreasing to 339,000 in June 2010, according to the BLS. The increase of 333,000 census workers from February 2009 to June 2010 amounts to 88 percent of the 379,000 overall increase in federal workers.

Not counting the temporary census workers leaves 46,000 other federal workers added on Obama’s watch. Clausen said it’s not possible to divine from the bureau’s database precisely where those workers were added.

We wondered how the non-census increase in federal workers during the first 17 full months of Obama’s presidency compared with the same period in predecessor George W. Bush’s presidency. Under Bush, from February 2001 through June 2002 the federal workforce increased by 16,000 to almost 2.8 million workers — about one third of the 46,000 bump (again, not counting temporary census workers) for the similar period under Obama.

Disregarding postal workers, who the BLS advises aren’t paid with federal tax aid, the number of federal workers through most of Bush’s presidency hovered around 1.9 million before passing 2 million in May 2008, according to the bureau. After Obama took over, the number of federal workers reached 2.2 million in April 2009, then dipped to 2.1 million by June 2009 before inching up to top 2.3 million in April 2010. There was a sizable one-month bump, to 2.7 million federal workers in May 2010, though the non-postal federal workforce dropped to 2.5 million in June 2010 and to less than 2.4 million in July. 
And how does Sessions’ statement come out?

He nails the drop in private-sector employment, even slightly understating results.

At first glance, Sessions’ figure for the increase of 500,000 federal employees seems solid. However, the 500,000 figure greatly overstates reality because temporary census workers account for most of that increase — a pivotal factor his statement doesn’t acknowledge.

Carcieri says tax repeal spawned thousands of new businesses and jobs
","
The furor over U.S. Sen. John Kerry’s yacht being docked on the tax-free shores of Rhode Island -- not in Massachusetts where he lives -- has subsided now that the senator’s team has promised he will pay the $500,000 in owed taxes.

But Rhode Island Governor Donald Carcieri did his part to make sure the underlying issue of Rhode Island’s tax exemption for boats is not forgotten.

In one of the governor’s frequent appearances on Fox News’ ""The Neil Cavuto Show,"" Carcieri touted the positive effect of the sales tax repeal on boat sales, the marine industry and the state’s economy as a whole.

""We abolished the tax on boats back in 1993 and in the intervening period we have over 2,000 little companies that have been spawned, employing almost 7,000 people, generating close to $2 billion a year in sales activity,"" an enthusiastic Carcieri told Cavuto, a conservative pundit from Barrington, R.I., who seems tickled by the Ocean State connection.

It’s no wonder Carcieri was excited. With the nation's fourth-highest unemployment rate, Rhode Island rarely gets to brag about any positive job news.

And it's clear the sales tax repeal -- enacted under then-Governor Bruce Sundlun -- helped rescue a sector that was taking on water by the early 1990s, having struggled after a boom in previous decades. Following the law's passage, boat registrations in Rhode Island increased every year for two decades before declining slightly during the recent recession.

But those are big numbers for a fairly narrow industry and they warrant a careful check.

The Carcieri administration told us that prior to the interview, they put out a request to several state agencies for data demonstrating the impact of the tax repeal.

The state Economic Development Corporation directed them to two studies by the Rhode Island Marine Trades Association: one from 2008 that focused on the skills gap in the industry and another from 2007 that looked at the effect of the repeal.

We got a hold of those reports and it appears the governor is close to correct. The studies collectively find that the Rhode Island marine industry includes 6,600 jobs across 2,300 companies, which generates $1.6 billion a year in sales activity. The numbers don't exactly line up, but they're fairly close to those that Carcieri cited.

The sales tax study does not make clear how it arrived at the final tallies and the Marine Trades Association refused to explain its methodology, saying it was confidential.

The second study tries harder to explain its approach. It relied on a combination of 136 survey results, as well as U.S. Economic Census numbers and economic modeling, to determine the totals. The researchers started by using the ratio of payroll to sales obtained from the 2002 U.S. Economic Census to determine the number of jobs, companies and total sales in what they call ""core marine trades industries."" It then appears that they added those numbers to a secondary group of similarly calculated figures that included companies considered to be ""indirect marine trades businesses.""  

That math makes sense to us. But then the study offers this caveat: ""In 2006, Rhode Island had approximately 1,700 businesses at least some of whose sales could be attributed to the state's 'direct' marine trades industries. Exactly how much was attributable to marine trades is impossible to determine from employment data reported by the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training.""

Put another way, there are a lot of companies in this state that may devote some, but not all, of their business to the boating industry. Paul Harden, manager of business and workforce development for the state Economic Development Corporation, offered a hypothetical example of a canvas textile company. It could manufacture boat covers, as well as awnings for shops. One product is clearly connected to the industry, the other is not. That unknown makes it difficult to track the number of jobs created and the business generated within the company specifically for marine work.

Based on experience, Harden, who helped oversee the Marine Trades study, said researchers assigned estimated percentages that each subcategory of business devotes to marine sales. He acknowledged that it is an imperfect science.

That's where Carcieri's claim gets a little shaky. He suggests the tallies are official, despite the study's stipulation that it is ""impossible"" to pinpoint an exact number.

But the bigger issue is that Carcieri says that all of these jobs, businesses and sales activity were ""spawned"" by the 1993 tax repeal on boats, which the study never concludes. It seems clear that the repeal had a positive effect on the industry, but some of the businesses and jobs predated the repeal.

""I don't think you can attribute all the job growth and all the sales activity to the repeal of the sales tax,"" said Harden, of the EDC.

Given the study's limits, we tried to verify the numbers independently.

We started with the state Division of Taxation. But because boats are not taxed, their sales are not reported to the division, said Tax Administrator David Sullivan. And the department doesn't collect data on marine-related sales.

Next we spoke with the state Department of Labor and Training, which collects data on jobs and companies in different industries. Similar to the Marine Trades study, its data shows that in 2009, approximately 4,560 people were employed in ""primary marine industries."" A second class of ""related industries"" adds about another 1,400 jobs for a total of close to 6,000. But here again, a DLT spokeswoman said it's impossible to know just how many of those related jobs are definitively connected to the marine sector. Realistically, the number probably falls somewhere between 4,560 and 6,000, both of which are lower than the number Carcieri cites.

And again, that's total jobs, not those ""spawned"" solely by the sales tax repeal.

Carcieri got it right by doing his research before spouting statistics on national television, and the studies he cites offer some measurable data. However, it is impossible to know how precise those numbers are and the governor should have offered that caveat. More troublesome, he should never have said the tax repeal ""spawned"" what amounts to an entire industry. We find this Half True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/08/donald-carcieri/carcieri-says-tax-repeal-spawned-new-business/

Fact-checking Lightfoot’s record on police discipline
","When mayoral candidate Lori Lightfoot makes her pitch to Chicago voters, the former federal prosecutor frequently recounts her record of working to reform the city’s police department. Lightfoot led a task force under outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel that called out the department for a history of racial discrimination and suggested far-reaching remedies in a 2016 report when criticism of police practices intensified following the police shooting death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. Chicago’s next mayor will enter office as the city prepares to implement a federal consent decree that aims to overhaul how the department operates. She also headed the Chicago Police Board, the department’s civilian oversight body charged with disciplining police officers, but stepped down from that post last spring to enter the mayor’s race. In a recent tweet, Lightfoot stressed her reform credentials by pointing to data she said showed the police board under her watch was increasingly aggressive in getting rid of cops accused of misconduct. As Police Board president and Police Accountability Task Force chair, I took on tough challenges and won critical reforms on police reform—but there is much more to do. I'll keep fighting for change and accountability every day. pic.twitter.com/fNkT81oMpU ""In hearings between 2011 and July 2015, the board fired 37% of officers"" read a graphic included in her tweet. It continued: ""Lori was president of the police board between July 2015 and April 2018. In hearings during that time period, the Police Board fired 72% of officers."" The graphic also highlighted a related disciplinary statistic: ""15% of officers (with pending disciplinary cases) chose to resign from CPD rather than face the board"" in the years before Lightfoot’s tenure. ""When Lori was president, the number of officers who chose to resign rather than face the board doubled, from 15% to 30%."" Such sharp increases in the share of discharges and resignations sounded like the result of a pretty significant leap in officer discipline, so we decided to check it out. When we reached out to Lightfoot’s campaign, a spokeswoman sent us disciplinary data summaries it got from the Chicago Police Board that back up Lightfoot’s comparison of discharge case results before she headed the the police board and those from during her tenure. The summaries make clear that Lightfoot is referencing two separate but related sets of numbers. The 72 percent figure refers to the share of officers whose cases went to a hearing and who were discharged after the board found them guilty of misconduct. The 30 percent figure deals with the share of all discharge cases referred to the board that ended in a resignation before a hearing took place. The board documents also back up Lightfoot’s claims about firings and resignations in the four plus years prior to her taking over the board. But there’s another way to look at the data Lightfoot culled her numbers from that takes some of the edge off her claim of increased disciplinary rigor. The board’s total caseload is so small that adding or subtracting even a handful of the cases it hears can significantly alter the disciplinary scorecard if expressed in percentage terms. Lightfoot served as president of the disciplinary board for less than three years, and during that time a total of 47 discharge cases were either heard by the panel or resolved before a hearing was held. In the comparable time period before Lightfoot took over, the board dealt with 63 discharge cases. The hard count of officers fired increased incrementally from 19 during the comparable period before Lightfoot to 21 during her time as president. In percentage terms, however, that translated into a big jump because the board heard fewer cases than in the past. To be clear, the lower number of cases that reached the board during Lightfoot’s time was beyond her control. After allegations of officer misconduct have been made and vetted by one of several investigative bodies, it’s up to the police department’s superintendent to recommend cases to the board. But the fact that these variables play such a large role in the percentage increase Lightfoot touted suggests it’s less a yardstick of her effectiveness as a disciplinarian and more of a math problem. Samuel Walker, a professor emeritus at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and an expert on police accountability, told us so many factors affect police discipline data that it’s problematic to focus on any one when evaluating the performance of a department or those who oversee it. ""It’s a statistical swamp,"" he said. Lightfoot’s tweet said that under her watch, the percentage of police board hearings that resulted in an officer being fired increased from 37 percent to 72 percent and that the share of discharge cases that ended because the cops involved decided to resign rather than face the board doubled from 15 percent to 30 percent. Those figures check out. It’s worth noting, however, that the total number of discharge cases the board reviews is so small that just a minor increase in officer firings by the board translated into a huge increase in the share of cases that ended in dismissals. Lightfoot’s claim itself is accurate, but it doesn’t do much to reinforce the self-portrait she is drawing on the campaign trail of a reformer who improved police accountability. We rate Lightfoot’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE — The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Gillibrand highlights 9/11 cancer deaths
","U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand says the federal government needs to maintain its commitment to those affected by the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, and is urging her colleagues to support a permanent victim compensation fund. ""The 9/11 death toll is still growing,"" Gillibrand said at a bill unveiling on Feb. 25. ""9/11 responders are still suffering. In the World Trade Center Health Program, 45,000 people are suffering from at least one 9/11-related chronic health condition. Over 10,000 have been certified with a 9/11-related cancer, with more being diagnosed every single day. And almost every day another 9/11 responder or survivor dies from a 9/11-related cancer.""    Gillibrand, now campaigning for president, has pushed for help for Sept. 11 responders and survivors for years. We wondered if her claim that ""almost every day another 9/11 responder or survivor dies from a 9/11-related cancer"" is true. More than 90,000 people enrolled in a federal program aimed at helping people suffering from health conditions related to the attacks of Sept. 11. Cancer diagnoses among Sept. 11 responders and survivors continue to be reported. Responders include emergency first responders, such as police and fire personnel, construction and demolition workers, volunteers, and others who worked at the site after the attacks. Survivors are those who lived and worked in the area, or were present there. The government reports people who have Sept. 11 health conditions live in all 50 states.  A study published in January from Rutgers University, which operates a clinic to provide care to World Trade Center responders and survivors, found significant increases in head and neck cancers among Sept. 11 responders. Judith Graber, lead author of the study, stated in a news release that the ""excess occurrence"" was ""plausible since first responders inhaled debris clouds containing many known carcinogens."" The federal government administers the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, which has paid nearly $5 billion to more than 21,000 claimants suffering from Sept. 11-related injuries, and the World Trade Center Health Program, which monitors and treats Sept. 11-related conditions. The health program is funded through 2090, but the compensation fund continues to receive new claims and is at risk of running out of money if Congress does not act. Gillibrand and some of her colleagues are trying to win support for a permanent compensation fund. Gillibrand's office referred us to two people it says have deep knowledge of the responder and survivor community for evidence of her claim, John Feal and Ben Chevat. Feal founded the Feal Good Foundation, which has a memorial wall on Long Island for responders who have died from a Sept. 11-related illness. Based on his tally, between 2,000 and 2,100 responders have died since 2008 from Sept. 11-related illnesses, including cancer, respiratory problems or suicide. That’s an average of a person every 2.7 days, he said. In the year ending on Sept. 1, 2018, 163 people died, or one every 2.2 days. Since Sept. 1, 2018, 61 responders have died from a Sept. 11-related illness, or one every three days. He has an additional list of 300 people whose families believe died from a Sept. 11-related illness, but whose presence at the disaster site or medical condition before their death has not been confirmed. Whitney Mitchell Brennan, Gillibrand's spokeswoman, also provided Feal's calculation that 2,100 people have died in 17 years, or approximately one death every three days.  Feal suspects many more people who responded to the site have died from illnesses related to their exposure at Ground Zero but have not been counted. His foundation searches obituaries for mentions of Sept. 11, and family members of the deceased reach out to the foundation on their own. But there are likely Sept. 11-related deaths that never come to the foundation’s attention, he said. People dealing with health effects from responding to the site may not realize the connection, and death certificates do not note a deceased person’s connection to Sept. 11.    Data on deaths are difficult to gather, in part because there is no official list of everyone who was at the site or who lived or worked nearby, said Chevat, executive director of 9/11 Health Watch, which monitors programs created to help people affected by Sept. 11 and advocates on behalf of responders, survivors and their families.     ""I am convinced that there are people that are dying from their conditions nearly every other day,"" Chevat said. Chevat said there isn't an official estimate of those who have died from Sept. 11-related illnesses, but he bases his opinion on his knowledge of the Sept. 11 survivor and responder community, as well as his tracking of news clips regarding Sept. 11-related deaths. The World Trade Center Health Program treats people who are dealing with health effects from Sept. 11, but does not have a comprehensive list of every survivor or responder, and is often not immediately notified when a patient dies, said Christina Spring, spokeswoman for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which directs the World Trade Center Health Program. Data from the program show that 641 people with a Sept. 11-related cancer certification have died since the end of 2012, but those deaths may have been caused for a reason other than their cancer, Spring said. If we start the clock in 2013, through 2018, that means someone with a certified Sept. 11-related cancer died every 3.4 days.   We also reached out to Dr. Iris Udasin, who studies health effects from the Sept. 11 attacks at Rutgers University. She said since Gillibrand said ""almost,"" the statement is ""reasonable,"" based on her knowledge and experience.    Our ruling Gillibrand said ""almost every day"" someone dies from a Sept. 11-related cancer. Since there is no official comprehensive record of these deaths, we have to evaluate other evidence in determining the accuracy of her claim. The data available ranges from one death from cancer for survivors and responders every 3.4 days to every 2.7 days for all causes for responders.  The 2.7 per day figure does not include people who were exposed to harmful conditions because they lived or worked near the disaster area, or responders who died without Feal’s knowledge. Doctors and experts who work with this population said more data is needed to know the frequency of 9/11 cancer-related deaths. That makes the known deaths at least half as frequent as Gillibrand said, beyond the bounds of ""almost,"" in our judgment. We rate Gillibrand’s statement Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2019/mar/09/kirsten-gillibrand/gillibrand-highlights-911-cancer-deaths/

Which city has the most Fortune 500 companies per capita?
","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott pointed to the city of Irving and its master-planned suburb of Las Colinas as evidence of the state’s economic prowess during remarks he shared Monday at a news conference in Austin after accepting the ""Governor’s Cup"" award from Site Selection magazine. ""We’re all working together to ensure prosperity from economic development,"" Abbott said at the news conference. ""As a result, the local economic development entities play a very profound role in making sure we win this cup. ""You need to know this, and that is that on a per-capita basis, Irving-Las Colinas has more Fortune 500 companies than any city in the United States of America."" Texas is home to many Fortune 500 (and Fortune 1000) companies, with Houston and Dallas boasting the most of any Texas cities. But is it possible that Irving has the most Fortune 500 companies per capita? Fortune 500 vs. Fortune 1000 When asked, Abbott spokesman John Wittman said Abbott misspoke and meant to say Irving-Las Colinas is home to the most Fortune 1000 companies per capita. We consulted the Irving-Las Colinas Chamber of Commerce website to see if they kept track of this information and found a statement that describes the city as the ""Headquarters of Headquarters, with more Fortune 1000 Headquarters per capita than any other city in the United States."" Erica Mulder, vice president of governmental affairs and communication for the chamber, said officials there had come to that conclusion by calculating their own per capita rate and then looking at the rate for other cities. Mulder did not return multiple requests for comment seeking more detailed information about how this comparison was conducted. On Friday morning, after PolitiFact Texas exchanged emails with officials at the Chamber, the claim was no longer visible on the webpage. Diving into the numbers Abbott’s original claim said Irving has more Fortune 500 companies per capita than any other city in the country. So, we looked at a list of Fortune 500 companies and their headquarters provided by Fortune magazine and the latest population estimates available for each city from the Census Bureau. Irving is home to seven companies on the Fortune 500 list, and the latest estimate from the Census Bureau shows it has a population of 240,373. This means there are about three Fortune 500 companies per 100,000 people in Irving. Here is where things get complicated. Looking cumulatively at the list of places with at least one Fortune 500 company, there are dozens of cities and towns that have a higher company-to-population ratio than Irving, according to our analysis. Among them are places like Mayfield Village, Ohio, and Bloomfield Hills, Mich., both of which have just one Fortune 500 company headquarters but small populations (3,408 and 3,990, respectively). This means Mayfield Village has a per capita value of 29 per 100,000 people and Bloomfield Hills has a per capita value of 25 per 100,000 people. However, to get a better understanding of how the number of companies per capita in Irving compares to other cities, it makes more sense to measure Irving against cities of a similar size. Looking at a list of cities with a population of over 100,000 and with at least one Fortune 500 company, Irving does have the most headquarters per capita. But the claim from the Irving-Las Colinas Chamber of Commerce and Abbott’s spokesman that the city has the most Fortune 1000 companies per capita of any city in the United States is inaccurate no matter how you look at it. With all headquarters locations in the mix, Irving does not come close to having the most Fortune 1000 companies per capita. When you compare it to cities of a similar size, those with more than 100,000 people, there are two cities with more Fortune 1000 companies per capita than Irving: Santa Clara, Calif., and Stamford, Conn. So what?  Abbott said that Irving has more Fortune 500 companies per capita than any city in the country during a speech praising economic development efforts happening statewide and locally in Texas. Nathan Jensen, a government professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies economic development strategies, said looking at the number of Fortune 500 companies in a particular city ""isn’t a metric that most academics would consider as particularly valuable."" Jensen said a better measurement of the economic success or vitality of a city or region would be to look at factors like unemployment and wage growth. ""There is a lot of criticism in the academic literature in focusing on the number of 'deals' that are made, as opposed to thinking hard about how policies and business activity affect a community,"" Jensen said in an email. Our ruling At a press conference celebrating the state’s economic success, Abbott said that, ""on a per capita basis, Irving-Las Colinas has more Fortune 500 companies than any city in the United States of America."" We did the math and his claim is wrong if you look at every single place with at least one Fortune 500 company. But when you do a more reasonable comparison with cities of a similar size (populations over 100,000), Irving does have the most Fortune 500 companies per capita. We rate this claim Mostly True.

Fact-checking presidential candidate Jay Inslee on climate change and 'the worst air in the world'
","Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, one of the Democrats running for president in 2020, has made climate change the centerpiece of his days-old campaign. Shortly before making his run official, he discussed the importance of climate change in an interview and made this claim about the impact of fires on his state: ""The forest fires were so grotesque last year that we had the worst air in the world in Washington. We were choking. It’s a very personal thing for me."" A couple of days after launching his campaign, Inslee repeated the worst-air claim during another discussion about climate change. We wanted to know whether Washington really had worse air quality than in India or China in 2018. We also wanted to explore how much climate change had to do with it. As smoke from wildfires blanketed the area during the summer of 2018, Seattle news reports said Seattle had the worst air quality in the world on Aug. 21, 2018. The reports cited rankings that day from AirVisual, an air monitoring service. AirVisual spokeswoman Kelsey Duska told us that during at least some points of that day, Seattle had the worst air among 85 cities, generally with a population of more than 400,000, around the world. Washington fared a little better in a broader set of monitoring done by AirVisual. Duska said that for the entire month of August 2018, the air in Chelan, Wash., about 180 miles east of Seattle, ranked fifth-worst among 3,000 cities worldwide. Rob Jackson, a Stanford University earth system science professor, told us that AirVisual’s numbers are reliable. So, Inslee’s worst-air claim is correct — for one day of the year. As for Inslee’s larger point, experts told us that climate change played a role in making the wildfires, and thus air quality, worse, but that other factors did, too. Inslee’s campaign pointed us to an article posted on National Public Radio’s website in the wake of the news reports about Seattle’s worst-air ranking. It carried this headline: ""Why Seattle had the worst air quality in the world at some points this summer."" The article was a transcript of an interview with Cliff Mass, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington. Maas said Seattle had had the worst air in 20 years — to the point that mountains and water around the city were not visible. Asked why the air was so bad, Mass cited the wildfires, adding that ""we had an atmospheric circulation that took the smoke directly from these nearby fires right over Seattle."" And Mass said he suspects that it would happen again in the future — but he pointed to forests, not climate change. ""Well, the big problem is our forests. We've suppressed fire now for almost a century,"" he said. ""A lot of the forests surrounding Seattle are in very bad condition. They're overgrown. They have a lot of slash, a lot of low bushes and trees. And they're completely unlike the forests that were here 150 years ago. And the problem is when they burn, they burn catastrophically. ""The question is how much of this is climate change. I suspect that only a small proportion of this is climate change. I think that the main problem is the forests, which are ready to burn. We have invasive grasses that have moved in that burn very easily. And human beings are increasingly starting fires with this huge number of people going in for recreation, other uses of the forested areas,"" he said.

""Now, on the long term, as the planet warms up, we certainly would expect more fires. So climate change, global warming probably contributed a small amount to it, but probably the key thing is what we've done to the surface of the planet."" Other experts gave more weight to the role of climate change. Stanford’s Jackson and John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at MIT, told us that climate change clearly is one factor in making the wildfires, and in turn air quality, worse. But they agreed that other factors, such as fire suppression, have also made the wildfires worse. Finally, Inslee’s campaign also pointed us to two other articles about wildfires and climate change: McClatchy news service reported on a federal study in November 2018 that said, ""California and the West have already witnessed an expansion of catastrophic blazes due to climate change and rising warming, with twice as much acreage burned by wildfire than would have occurred otherwise."" And Scientific American reported on an academic study that, according to the magazine, found that climate change not only is increasing the likelihood of wildfires, the ""wildfires are causing a spike in air pollution across the West.""   However, Daniel Jaffe, a University of Washington professor of environmental chemistry, said in that article that while climate change makes wildfires worse, so does forest management. In discussing climate change, Inslee said, ""The forest fires were so grotesque last year that we had the worst air in the world in Washington."" By one measure, of 85 major cities across the globe, Seattle had the worst air quality in the world on Aug. 21, 2018, as wildfires pushed smoke into the area. That was for one day of the year. Experts said climate change is one factor in making the forest fires, and in turn air quality, worse; but other factors, such as fire suppression practices, have also made the fires worse.

Trump is wrong that Obama White House refused to turn over documents in congressional probes
","  President Donald Trump recently offered some inaccurate remarks to reporters about the congressional investigations into his campaign and his business practices. Trump’s comments came after House Democrats released a list of 81 people who will be receiving document requests related to ongoing congressional investigations. Here’s what Trump said during the March 5 White House event: ""Instead of doing infrastructure, instead of doing health care, instead of doing so many things that they should be doing, they want to play games. President Obama, from what they tell me, was under a similar kind of a thing — didn’t give one letter. They didn’t do anything. They didn’t give one letter of the request. Many requests were made; they didn’t give a letter."" Trump’s point that the Obama administration stonewalled all congressional demands for information is wrong. Veterans of the Obama administration immediately shot back. From 2011 - 2016 the Obama White House produced hundreds of thousands of documents to Congress on Solyndra, Benghazi, Fast and Furious, CAFE standards rule, Deep Water Horizon spill, ACA, ACA website, Clean Water Rule, and Ft Hood shooting. https://t.co/V3qA99TBxm And they have a point. As we’ve reported, the Obama administration — contrary to what Trump previously asserted — did participate in significant congressional oversight efforts. Here are some of the major investigations during Obama’s presidency: • Loans to the solar company Solyndra. The company collapsed after taking a $535 million federal loan guarantee, and Republicans noted that a campaign bundler for Obama was a key investor. The loan default prompted an investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. • Alleged political bias at the Internal Revenue Service. This controversy involved charges that IRS officials were unfairly targeting conservative groups for unusual scrutiny in applications to become a tax-exempt organization. This attracted an investigation by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the Senate Finance Committee, and a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee. • The Benghazi consulate terrorist attack in 2012, in which four Americans died, including the U.S. ambassador. The circumstances surrounding the attack were investigated by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, several House panels led by the House Intelligence Committee, and a specially created House Benghazi committee. • The ""gun-walking"" program known as Fast & Furious, in which the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, partly during Obama’s presidency, allowed guns to be sold to Mexican nationals in the hopes of tracking down drug cartel leaders. The program was investigated jointly by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee. For the most part, the Obama administration did turn over documents demanded by lawmakers. For instance, the Solyndra investigation looked at 300,000 documents, the IRS investigation looked at 1.3 million, the Benghazi probes looked at hundreds of thousands, and Fast & Furious looked at more than 10,000. It’s worth noting that the Obama administration didn’t hand over documents willy-nilly. On occasion, the administration opposed turning over documents. This happened in the investigations over Solyndra, Fast & Furious, and Benghazi. But noncooperation was generally struck down in the courts, and the administration eventually handed over the documents. ""Some documents were withheld and the administration cited specific reasons for withholding those documents,"" said Eric Schickler, a University of California-Berkeley political scientist who co-authored the book ""Investigating the President: Congressional Checks on Presidential Power."" ""I cannot say if those reasons were ‘good’ or not, but they were not withheld in a blanket or wholesale manner."" Douglas Kriner, Schickler’s co-author and a government professor at Cornell University, said the push-pull dynamic over documents between the executive and legislative branches is as old as the republic, dating to investigations of a military disaster in the Ohio frontier under President George Washington. ""So the Obama administration precedents are consistent with past practice,"" Kriner said. ""Any effort to cite them to justify mass-scale noncompliance with recent requests for documentation from the White House is disingenuous."" That said, the comparison between the Obama and Trump administrations is not entirely apples-to-apples. We’re not aware of any congressional investigations into Obama’s personal finances, as is happening to Trump. (Obama’s business and real estate holdings were trivial compared to Trump’s.) The four investigations outlined above tended to focus on activities of executive branch agencies rather than the White House itself. ""I do not know of any major investigations of the Obama White House itself,"" said Charles Tiefer, a University of Baltimore law professor who previously served as solicitor and deputy general counsel of the U.S. House of Representatives. When Elise J. Bean, a Wayne State law professor, worked for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations from 1999 to 2014 — a period that partially overlapped with Obama’s presidency — she didn’t recall ever sending a document request letter to the White House. By contrast, ""we sent lots of document requests to agencies like the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Homeland Security."" The Trump White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Trump said that when Congress sought documents from Obama, the White House ""didn’t do anything. They didn’t give one letter of the request. Many requests were made. They didn’t give a letter."" That’s not what happened. The Obama administration gave hundreds of thousands of documents to Congress in at least four investigations. For a fraction of those documents, the administration went to court to try to head off the request, but courts generally sided with Congress, and the documents were ultimately handed over. Experts say the scenario is typical of the longstanding skirmishing between the executive and legislative branches. The documents handed over were mostly those of executive branch agencies, rather than the White House. In large part, that’s because questions never arose about Obama’s personal finances.

McConnell wrong about tracking absentee ballots in NC
","Election security has come under the microscope since North Carolina nullified the results of a November congressional race. The state elections board ordered a new election after finding ballot tampering in the 9th District, where Republican Mark Harris appeared to beat Democrat Dan McCready. Political operatives working for the Harris campaign had collected absentee ballots and then, according to some testimony, cast illegal votes and forged witness signatures. In a speech on the Senate floor, Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently cited North Carolina’s case while criticizing Democrats for not doing more to prevent election fraud. He said loose absentee voting laws threaten the ""nature of our representative democracy"" because they allow political operatives to take control of ballots. ""And once those operatives take a hold of those ballots, the voters have no way to keep tabs on whether they were ever delivered,"" he said in the Feb. 26 speech, according to this copy. Is it true that absentee voters have no way of knowing whether their ballots were delivered? McConnell’s speech didn't refer to any state specifically. But his claim was made as he spoke about what happened in North Carolina. However, in North Carolina, election officials do provide a method for voters to track their ballots. The method requires voters to have access to a computer and know how to navigate the internet, which may be an obstacle for some voters. (About 11 percent of Americans don’t use the internet, according to a 2018 Pew Research survey.) Still, it’s a way voters can ""keep tabs"" on their ballots. ""An absentee vote, by law, is not tallied until Election Day, although absentee applications are approved throughout the absentee period via absentee meetings of county boards,"" said Pat Gannon, a spokesman for the NC elections board. ""There are ways to track absentee ballots through our public data, and many people outside this agency used that data to look into absentee voting irregularities in the 2018 election cycle,"" he said. ONLINE TRACKING One way to track your ballot is through the NC elections board’s ""voter lookup"" tool on its website: ncsbe.gov. The tool currently appears on the left side of the website’s homepage. Once registered voters enter their name and hit ""search,"" they’ll be taken to a webpage with search results. Those results may show several names in a list. Voters can click on their name, which will take them to a new page. The page will show a voter’s information such as their address, political party affiliation and polling place. One section of the page is titled ""absentee request."" By clicking on it, voters can see when an absentee ballot was sent, what address it was sent to, and whether a voted ballot was received by the county board. County election boards in North Carolina are tasked with tracking the progress of absentee ballot requests. ""If a voter wanted to do so, they could look up their information in the daily online spreadsheet file that the counties and State Board of Elections produces every day of early voting,"" said Michael Bitzer, politics professor at Catawba College in Salisbury. They can look in the column marked ""Received,"" to see if their absentee by-mail ballot was received, Bitzer said. They can also see if the ballot was ""accepted"" or rejected, with the associated date. MCCONNELL PUSHBACK When we presented this information to McConnell’s office, McConnell spokesman Don Stewart suggested that absentee ballot delivery opens the door to fraud. Voters ""have no way of knowing whether it was the actual ballot or a replacement,"" Stewart said. ""If you hand me (someone who you don’t know) your ballot, and I sign your name to a different ballot and turn in the different ballot, you have no way to keep tabs on whether or not YOUR ballot was delivered,"" he continued. ""You can only trust that I did the right thing, but no way of tracking that."" That theory is not only far-fetched but ""next to impossible"" to execute, said Gannon, the NC election board spokesman. ""What they’re suggesting would take a conspiracy of a grand scale, and it would result in the conspirators committing multiple felonies for each ballot,"" Gannon said, referring to the scenario presented by Stewart. Each absentee ballot in NC has special markings and a special number, Gannon said. First, the person who might try to replace someone’s absentee ballot would have to get blank ballots, ""which include special markings and are printed on special card stock and cut in specific ways,"" he said. ""That would require theft from a county board office, or a county employee or ballot printing vendor would have to be in on the conspiracy,"" Gannon said. ""Second, each county typically has numerous ballot styles for each election, so anyone trying to switch out ballots likely would have to have access to all of the ballot styles,"" he continued. ""Third, county board employees write a CIV number on each ballot. That number is assigned to an individual voter. Conspirators would have to write that number on each fraudulent ballot in such a way that it wouldn’t raise a red flag to the county board when the ballots came back."" OUR RULING McConnell said that, once political operatives take hold of those ballots, ""voters have no way to keep tabs on whether they were ever delivered."" The NC elections board enables voters to track the status of their absentee ballots online. That may not help some voters who don’t use the internet. Nonetheless, it’s an available tracking option.

Did Beto O'Rourke and Kirsten Gillibrand say they'd tear down border wall if elected president?
","While President Donald Trump wants to build a border wall, Democrats Beto O’Rourke and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand want to tear it down, claimed a political group aiming to get pro-Trump candidates elected to federal office. ""[email protected] and @SenGillibrand have both said they would tear down the wall if elected president. THAT sums up the difference between President Trump and the Radical Democrats,"" said a March 1 tweet from America First. .@BetoORourke and @SenGillibrand have both said they would tear down the wall if elected president.THAT sums up the difference between President Trump and the Radical Democrats. America First describes itself as a super Political Action Committee dedicated to electing federal candidates who support Trump’s agenda. Did America First accurately describe what O’Rourke and Gillibrand have said about border walls? The tweet is partially accurate, but it leaves out important details. O’Rourke, a former U.S. representative from Texas, said in an MSNBC interview that he would ""absolutely"" take down border barriers in El Paso, Texas. O’Rourke later said he supported barriers along some parts of the border. Asked if she agreed with O’Rourke’s statement of dismantling border wall in El Paso, Gillibrand, a U.S. senator from New York, did not give a definitive answer. She said she would need to learn more about it, ""and if it makes sense, I could support it."" O’Rourke has not said whether he will run for president. MSNBC’s Chris Hayes interviewed O’Rourke on Feb. 14 near the U.S.-Mexico border in El Paso and asked him about taking down the border wall. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, initially posed the question on Twitter for O’Rourke. Hayes: ""I want to pass along from, a question from a congressman who does not represent the border but he is in Texas, Dan Crenshaw, who is a new member of Congress. He’s been very outspoken in favor of the president’s agenda on the border particularly."" O’Rourke: ""Right."" Hayes: ""And he wanted to ask you — he tweeted this, I’m just passing it along. It’s not something, he didn’t text me. You know, would you — if you could, would you take the wall down now, here?"" O’Rourke: ""Yes."" Hayes: ""Like you have a wall and knock it down."" O’Rourke: ""Absolutely. I’d take the wall down."" Hayes: ""You think if there’s a referendum here in the city, that would pass?"" O’Rourke: ""I do."" O’Rourke added that wall and fencing has ""not in any demonstrable way made us safer."" He said the barriers cost tens of billions of dollars to build and maintain and pushed migrants, refugees and asylum seekers ""to the most inhospitable, the most hostile stretches of the U.S.-Mexico border ensuring their suffering and death."" A few days after that interview, O’Rourke said there was ""a role"" for barriers in some parts of the border. ""I think there is a role for physical barriers in some places,"" O’Rourke said Feb. 19, according to the Texas Tribune. The Texas Tribune said O’Rourke made clear that his comment about taking down wall was specific to El Paso, because crime data did not suggest a wall made the city safer. ""On border barriers elsewhere, O'Rourke said he ‘would work with local stakeholders, the property owners, the communities, those who actually live there to determine the best security solution,’"" the Texas Tribune reported. So O’Rourke has said he’d take down a wall in El Paso but does not oppose a wall in other parts of the border. A Fox News reporter asked Gillibrand about O’Rourke’s border wall statement to MSNBC as she campaigned in New Hampshire on Feb. 15. Gillibrand did not outright say she would tear down the wall if elected president. She said she would need to examine the issue ""and if it makes sense, I could support it."" Reporter: ""What about a proposal from Beto O’Rourke to actually remove some of the existing wall, he was talking about El Paso. But the idea of dismantling some of the wall, good idea? Bad idea?"" Gillibrand: ""Well, I’d have to ask folks in that part of the country to see whether the fencing that exists today is helpful or unhelpful. ""But you know, Democrats are not afraid of national security or border security. Democrats have funded border security for decades. So it’s not a question of not wanting to keep the country safe. But what President Trump wants to do is build a medieval-style wall out of concrete and one that will destroy not just the community but the environment. And it is a hateful message. I mean he's trying to create a picture of division and hate and derision, and that’s what I’m so offended by. The fact that he spews this kind of racism in his words and actions is troubling. ""So, I could look at it and see which part he means and why, and if it makes sense, I could support it."" America First stood by its tweet in a statement to PolitiFact. ""Let’s be clear here: Gillibrand and O’Rourke both support open borders and oppose President Trump’s border protection policies,"" said Alex Titus, spokesman for America First. ""Their past statements on tearing down the wall speak volumes."" America First tweeted that O’Rourke and Gillibrand ""have both said they would tear down the wall if elected president."" The tweet doesn’t tell the whole story. O’Rourke in an MSNBC interview said he’d take down wall in El Paso. O’Rourke later said ""there is a role"" for physical barriers in other parts of the U.S.-Mexico border. Gillibrand did not denounce O’Rourke’s MSNBC statement of taking down wall in El Paso, but she also did not unreservedly embrace that position. Gillibrand said that if that made sense, she could support it, but would first need to evaluate the barriers’ effectiveness.

North Carolina lawmaker points out shrinking gap in high-school graduation rates
","In his response to Gov. Roy Cooper’s State of the State address, North Carolina Senate leader Phil Berger rattled off a list of achievements he said were the result of Republican-led investments in education. Amidst talk of charter schools, scholarships and teacher pay raises, one claim in particular made our ears perk up. ""Since 2011, the gap in high school graduation rates between African-American students and all students has been cut in half, from 6.4 percent to 3.1 percent,"" Berger said. The claim was so specific that we wanted to check it for ourselves. It turns out the numbers are accurate. Berger spokesman Pat Ryan said the statistics came from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, which keeps track of graduation rates and publishes them online. According to the department, the graduation rate for all students graduating in 2010-11 was 77.9 percent, and the rate for black students that year was 71.5 percent. That means there was a 6.4 percentage-point gap between the rate for all students and the rate for black students. The gap has shrunk by more than half since then, getting smaller every year between 2010-11 and 2016-17, when it reached a low of 2.6 percentage points. In 2017-18, the graduation rate for all students was 86.3 percent, and the graduation rate for black students was 83.2 percent, making the gap just 3.1 percentage points. Berger’s language was not as precise as it could have been, as he referred to the gap in terms of percents instead of percentage points. He also cited graduation rates for African Americans when the actual statistic from the Department of Public Instruction relates to black students. But the numbers are right and his main point is clear. For the record, graduation rates for white students were 82.6 in 2010-11 and 89.6 in 2017-18, so the gap between black and white students has been larger at both points in time than the gap between black students and the student population as a whole. Berger said, ""Since 2011, the gap in high school graduation rates between African-American students and all students has been cut in half, from 6.4 percent to 3.1 percent.""

Did Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis get a ""historic commitment"" from Trump for Hurricane Michael aid?
","Editor’s note, March 10 12:55 p.m.: Two days after our fact-check posted, the White House issued a press release stating President Donald Trump on March 10 ordered that the federal government will cover 100 percent of eligible costs for debris removal and emergency protective measures for 45 days from Hurricane Michael’s landfall. It does not affect our ruling. In his campaign for governor, Ron DeSantis promised Florida voters that his personal relationship with President Donald Trump would pay off for the state. A little more than two months since taking office, DeSantis claims it already has. DeSantis used part of his first State of the State speech March 5 to trumpet news of a ""historic commitment"" from the Trump administration to help repair parts of the Panhandle that Hurricane Michael battered in October. ""I’ve already traveled to Washington, D.C., and secured a historic commitment from the Trump administration to provide assistance to the communities that Michael battered,"" DeSantis said. Is that true? Part of the answer, PolitiFact Florida found, relies on a handshake agreement between the governor and president. The other part about it being it ""historic"" is more easily understood, and wrong. After Michael barreled through the areas around Mexico Beach, federal emergency management officials said the federal government would pay 100 percent of the costs for debris removal and emergency protective measures for a period five days. After that, the federal government would cover 75 percent of the costs. DeSantis asked Trump to extend 100 percent federal coverage for 45 days. ""Debris remains pervasive, and thousands of businesses are still struggling to reopen,"" DeSantis wrote to Trump, saying the state had already spent $1 billion. DeSantis met with Trump at the White House in January and said Trump granted his request. The agreement between Trump and DeSantis remains a verbal one, however. DeSantis spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferre told PolitiFact Florida the state does not have written confirmation, and FEMA media relations headquarters did not respond to our requests for days. Shortly after our fact-check initially posted, a FEMA spokeswoman told us that the agency was aware of the announcement by DeSantis regarding the increase in the federal cost share and that the request was in process. She did not elaborate. Local governments we talked to are proceeding as if the deal is done. Bay County, for example, submitted for reimbursement March 8. County spokeswoman Valerie Sale said she expects the project will be covered at the current federal share of 75 percent and will be adjusted on subsequent projects if or when the federal share is modified. According to Sale, her county heard from a FEMA official, Nelson Santos, who said FEMA was working on codifying the change into the Federal Register. We reached Santos by email to confirm. ""The only confirmation I made clear to Bay County consultants is the 5-days to 45-days extension,"" Santos, a FEMA program delivery manager, told PolitiFact in an email. ""It has not been determined or official as of yet what the cost share will be."" The best answer we could get from FEMA by deadline was that DeSantis’ request remains in process and has not yet been determined. The extension would be a ""game changer,"" Bay County Commission Chairman Philip ""Griff"" Griffitts told PolitiFact, saving county taxpayers there an estimated $85 million. Tanya Castro, administrator of hard-hit Mexico Beach, said that her city was advised verbally by state and FEMA officials that it will receive the full amount of its reimbursement, but she didn’t have any formal documentation. Mexico Beach Mayor Al Cathey praised efforts by DeSantis to help his coastal community including $2.8 million in state money for debris cleanup. So far, FEMA provided about $2 million for cleanup. But Cathey said his city needs more money. ""We need it fast,"" he said. Assuming the extension will occur, it’s not as historic as DeSantis let on. In 2017, Trump authorized 100 percent coverage for Puerto Rico for 180 days following Hurricane Maria. He later extended the amount of time to 90 days for debris and 60 days for emergency protective measures. He also authorized 100 percent coverage for the Virgin Islands for emergency protective measures for 30 days following Hurricane Irma. Trump then extended his order for 60 days, both for debris removal and emergency protective measures in response to hurricanes Maria and Irma. Trump was not the first president to do this. President George W. Bush gave the go-ahead for extensions that provided 100 percent coverage for months in Louisiana and Mississippi. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said the federal Stafford Act allows the president to reduce or eliminate the share of cost borne by local or state entities, Ellis said. ""I wouldn’t call that historic,"" Ellis said. ""It has been done before."" When we told DeSantis’ office about we learned, she clarified that this was the first time in Florida history that a newly elected governor received the president’s commitment to increase the 100 percent coverage from five to 45 days. ""We are not aware of any time in Florida history where a hurricane received this many days at 100 percent reimbursement other than the three storms in 2005, which were considered as a group,"" Ferre said. ""This is a historic extension for Florida. Gov. DeSantis has the commitment from the president of the United States, who is the only one who can authorize it."" Meanwhile, some federal lawmakers have expressed frustration that despite efforts by both chambers, the budget deal Trump signed in February to end the shutdown included no disaster relief. ""Florida’s Panhandle needs help now, not six months down the road,"" said U.S. Rep. Neal Dunn, a Republican from northwest Florida. DeSantis said, ""I’ve already traveled to Washington, D.C. and secured a historic commitment from the Trump administration to provide assistance to the communities that Michael battered."" DeSantis provided no details in his speech, but he was referring to his effort in January to get Trump to extend the amount of time the federal government would pick up the tab for debris removal and emergency protective measures from five to 45 days. DeSantis got a verbal commitment from Trump to make that happen, but we were unable to confirm that with FEMA. A spokeswoman for DeSantis says the ""historic commitment"" is that such an extension is unusual for Florida. But we found that it’s not unusual for the president to tack on extensions even for months that the federal government will pick up the entire tab. We rate this claim Mostly False.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This Cadbury rumor first appeared in 2018, and has been debunked before. The claim is unsubstantiated on several levels. First, a reverse-image search shows that the photo was published on multiple Nigerian websites in 2014 and is of Boko Haram terrorist Aminu Ogwuche, who was accused of planning the April 14, 2014, bus park bombing in the Nigerian suburb of Abuja. The blast killed 71 people and injured another 120, according to reports. The photo shows Ogwuche being extradited by international police to Nigeria from South Sudan. Second, no arrests have been made and no warnings issued about the British confectionery company’s products being contaminated with HIV. There have also been no recalls or media reports of such a thing. Third, and probably most importantly, it is nearly impossible to contract HIV by food consumption. According to the Centers for Disease Control, HIV does not survive outside of the human’s bodily fluids and it cannot reproduce outside a human host: ""You can’t get HIV from consuming food handled by someone with HIV. Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus,"" the CDC says. In very rare cases, HIV has been found to have been spread from an infected person to another through pre-chewed food. According to the CDC, the only known cases where this has occurred is when the pre-chewed food was shared with an infant.  The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver’s mouth mixes with food while chewing.  Posts on social media claim that Cadbury candy products are contaminated after an HIV-positive worker was arrested for infecting the products with his blood. This rumor has been going around for over a year, and is completely bogus. The man in the photo is a Nigerian terrorist and there is no evidence that Cadbury products have ever been contaminated with the virus.

Parson correct that Missouri maintains lowest levels of highway funding in the country
","In his State of the State speech, Gov. Mike Parson discussed his goals for improving workforce development and infrastructure in Missouri. He pointed to plans to expand broadband, improve river transportation and the need to care for Missouri highways. ""Missouri has one of the largest highway systems in the country, and since we sit at the nexus of east and west, this system receives a great deal of strain,"" Parson said. ""Nonetheless, we maintain this system with one of the lowest levels of funding in the country."" Where does Missouri rank in highway funding? Does the state have lower highway funding than Rhode Island or Vermont? We decided to find out. According to Parsons’ press office, this claim was taken from the Missouri Department of Transportation’s Citizen's Guide on Transportation Funding. The guide says, ""Missouri ranks 48th nationally in revenue per mile, primarily because the state’s large system — the nation’s seventh largest with 33,859 miles of highways — is funded with one of the lowest fuel taxes in the country: 17 cents per gallon."" The key term here is ""revenue per mile."" When you divide the average funding by the miles of roads maintained, Missouri ranks at the bottom. According to the Citizen’s Guide on Transportation, ""Missouri’s revenue per mile is $50,882, while the national average is $238,076."" When asked, a spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Transportation pointed to the same data. ""Missouri ranks seventh in miles of highways maintained,"" spokeswoman Sally Oxenhandler said in an email. When the Missouri legislature raised the state fuel tax in 1952, MoDOT took on an additional 12,000 miles of road maintenance. The goal was to have 95 percent of Missouri residents within 2 miles of a hard-surfaced road, Oxenhandler said. The low funding level ""leads to significant unfunded transportation needs across Missouri,"" Oxenhandler added. We cross-checked this data with the U.S. Department of Transportation and found it was accurate. When evaluating total funding, however, Missouri does not rank as low. Using aggregated data from the Federal Highway Administration, Missouri ranks 26th in highway funding revenue. Texas, California and New York rank at the top, and Vermont, Rhode Island and Wyoming rank at the bottom. Robert S. Kirk, a specialist in transportation policy with the Congressional Research Service, said in an email, ""If the issue is how much financial effort the state is putting into the roads, revenue per mile of state road is OK, as would be vehicle miles traveled per revenue spent."" The important thing is that the amount of state maintained road is compared to the amount of money spent maintaining roads. Parson said, Missouri has one of the lowest levels of highway funding in the country. Missouri ranks 48th in highway revenue per mile. Though Missouri ranks 26th in total highway funding revenue, this measure does not take into consideration the amount of road a state must maintain. Revenue per mile is the best measure to evaluate highway funding, taking into account the amount of roads in a state in addition to the number of dollars spent. With this evaluation, Missouri does have one of the lowest levels of highway funding.

The company also has video of Zapata waving to the crowd far below at the 2018 Grand Prix in France.
 Franky Zapata demonstrates his Flyboard Air at the 2018 Grand Prix. (Screenshot) The one off-beat note in the Facebook post is the headline. It said Zapata was going over 103 miles per hour, which is faster than the company says is possible. Which hardly seems to matter as he whizzes past. A video on Facebook showed a man flying while standing on a small device, ostensibly at over 103 miles per hour. He did, though not quite as fast as the headline claimed.

Did tax collections rise after GOP law? The case is weak
","Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., recently took to cable TV to tout the December 2017 tax law, a law he said was fiscally responsible. On March 6, Lankford appeared on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe,"" a day after the Treasury Department reported that the federal deficit was 77 percent higher during the first four months of fiscal year 2019 than it was during the equivalent time period a year earlier. ""I've had a lot of folks push back and say the tax cuts that happened last year contributed to the deficit,"" Lankford said on MSNBC on March 6. ""The facts are actually coming out different. Yesterday I laid out on the floor that the numbers for fiscal year ‘17 and ‘18 are in. Tax revenue went up, actually, $14 billion last year after the tax cut actually occurred. We had greater revenue."" Lankford was referring to a Senate floor speech he’d given on March 5. Here’s an excerpt: ""We are now a fiscal year through. Our revenue for fiscal year 2017—the year before the tax reform—was $3.315 trillion. Our revenue after the tax cut and the tax reform, for fiscal year 2018, is $3.329 trillion. If you are doing the math in your head, that is $14 billion more in revenue after the tax cuts. That means our revenue went up the next year. Contrary to all the myths that were out there early on saying we were going to have this giant hole in the budget, our revenue went up after the tax cuts went into place."" Is Lankford correct that tax revenue went up after the tax law was passed? His office reiterated that between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018, tax collections did indeed go up in nominal dollars by about $14 billion, according to Treasury Department data. However, as the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget points out, revenues decreased if you factor in inflation or calculate it as a percentage of GDP. Perhaps more importantly, looking at the issue this way glosses over a major flaw: A significant share of the fiscal year 2018 revenues Lankford considered to be ""after the tax cut"" were actually governed by the old tax law, as we noted in an October 2018 fact-check of a similar claim by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. That’s the case because several months during fiscal year 2018 either occurred before the tax law went into effect (specifically, October, November and December) or were dominated by annual tax payments made under the old tax code’s rules (February, March and April). So the best way to compare pre-law and post-law tax collection patterns is to look at months that were governed by different laws. Using monthly Treasury Department reports, we separated out the following eight months where there is a clean comparison: June, July, August, and September (in fiscal years 2017 and 2018) and October, November, December, and January (in fiscal years 2018 and 2019). This chart summarizes what we found.   This chart paints quite a different picture than Lankford offered. Of the eight months we looked at, tax collections declined in seven after the new law took effect. And if you combine the cumulative total from those eight months, tax collections went down by almost $61 billion -- a much less optimistic finding than Lankford’s $14 billion increase. Ben Page, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, called the differences in tax collection before and after the law ""striking."" Outside of a recession, he said, a combination of population growth, general economic expansion and inflation usually pushes tax collections higher from year to year. And that didn’t happen for seven of these eight months. Lankford said, ""Tax revenue went up, actually, $14 billion last year after the tax cut actually occurred. We had greater revenue."" This figure comes from a misleading calculation, one in which part of the increase in fiscal year 2018 came from tax collections governed by the old law. If you look at eight months that were shaped by a true before-and-after comparison, tax collections went down in seven of those months, and collectively, revenues fell by about $61 billion.

Clinton on the hot seat with claim that thousands were turned away from the polls in Wisconsin
","More than two years after losing the 2016 presidential race to Republican Donald Trump, it seems Hillary Clinton is still focused on Wisconsin -- a state she narrowly lost. And one where she, quite notably, never campaigned during the general election. In a March 3, 2019 speech shown by national news outlets, including C-Span, Clinton claimed tens of thousands of people in Wisconsin were ""turned away"" from the polls because of their skin color or other factors. Her remarks were part of a program marking the 54th anniversary of the first march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. Marchers that day were met and beaten by state troopers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in what became known as ""Bloody Sunday. "" In her comments, Clinton said this: ""I was the first person who ran for president without the protection of the Voting Rights Act. I’ll tell you, it makes a really big difference. And it doesn’t just make a difference in Alabama and Georgia. It made a difference in Wisconsin, where the best studies that have been done said somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls because of the color of their skin, because of their age, because of whatever excuse could be made up to stop a fellow American citizen from voting."" The number is vital, since Trump defeated Clinton by 22,748 votes. She also narrowly lost Michigan and Pennsylvania -- and with those states, the presidency. Is Clinton correct about Wisconsin? Do studies show ""somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls because of the color of their skin"" and other factors? And was the lack of Voting Rights Act protections to blame? OUR PROCESS: Read how PolitiFact checks everyone. A familiar claim We have looked at similar claims in the past -- including one from U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and one from Clinton herself. Baldwin stated turnout in Wisconsin ""was reduced by approximately 200,000 votes because of"" a new photo ID requirement. Clinton later claimed ""the best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote"" in the 2016 presidential election."" We rated both Mostly False. And, though Clinton’s new claim is different, those items provide a good starting point. The 2016 contest was the first presidential election in which Wisconsin’s photo ID law was fully in effect. In making her claim, Baldwin cited a May 2017 report commissioned by Priorities USA Action, a political action committee that supported Clinton and Barack Obama. Comparing the 2012 and 2016 elections, the report said that on average, turnout increased 1.3 percent in states in which there was no change to voter ID laws, but decreased 3.3 percent in Wisconsin. Had Wisconsin’s photo ID law not been in effect, the report argues, Wisconsin’s turnout would have been 200,000 votes higher, based on the average increase of 1.3 percent. Independent experts told us the methodology in the study was lacking. In a nutshell: The photo ID requirement undoubtedly prevented or discouraged some individual people from voting. But the report attributes all of the lower turnout to the ID law, when there were many other reasons that could also explain it, including a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton or Trump -- or even a belief that Trump couldn’t win Wisconsin. In one of our earlier items, we cited the perspective of Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He noted that Trump earned almost the same number of votes in Wisconsin as did Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee. ""Clinton, in contrast, earned 238,000 fewer voters than did Obama,"" he told us at the time. ""It would be a mistake to attribute essentially all of that decline to the voter ID requirement."" Clinton’s claim In making her new claim, Clinton attributed what happened in Wisconsin to the fact that the Voting Rights Act was no longer in effect. That refers to a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down Section 4 of the Act. The problem: Wisconsin was never one of the states covered by that section. As our friends at the Washington Post’s Fact-checker noted in their analysis of Clinton’s remarks: Wisconsin was not one of the states covered by Section 4 when the court ruled in 2013, so, right off the bat, Clinton’s claim that this ""made a difference in Wisconsin"" is unfounded. Georgia was covered by Section 4, but Clinton’s claim that total voter registration declined in that state from 2012 to 2016 is false; it increased. We could not reach Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill for our fact-check, but he offered several studies and other arguments to the Post. Chief among them: A 2017 study led by Ken Mayer, a political scientist at the UW-Madison. That study involved a survey of  293 registered voters who didn’t vote in Dane and Milwaukee counties in the 2016 election. The study focuses on those where were ""deterred"" from voting, which it defined as meaning the voters ""lack qualifying ID or mention ID as a reason for not voting. Voter ID could be a nominal reason or the primary reason for not voting."" We should note that Mayer told the Post that 14,000 is ""the equivalent of the most likely number"" of those deterred by the voter ID law. In any case, ""deterred"" is different than ""prevented"" or -- as Clinton phrased it -- ""turned away."" The study put a much smaller group in its stricter ""prevented"" category. It also warned against extrapolating the results from Milwaukee and Dane counties to the state as a whole. Yet that is just what Clinton did. So Clinton has problems on the low end of the range (40,000). Where does her high end number (80,000) come from? Merrill, the Clinton spokesman, told the Post it was based on the same Priorities USA study that was the basis for her earlier 200,000 estimate (the one we rated Mostly False). Merrill told the Post the 80,000 was a ""conservative estimate well within the range of the two studies."" The Post gave Clinton a ""Four Pinnochio"" rating for its review of her comments. Our rating In a speech, Clinton said because a key provision of the Voting Rights Act was not in effect, ""somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls (in Wisconsin) because of the color of their skin"" and other factors. She is wrong about the impact of the Voting Rights Act not being in effect. The provision in question never applied to Wisconsin. She also has problems with the numbers on both ends of her range. What’s more, the claim -- and others like it -- put all of the blame for people not voting on the state’s photo ID law. That ignores other factors, such as a lack of enthusiasm from voters, or the belief -- one apparently shared by candidate Clinton -- that the state was a safe one for her in 2016.

Bernie Sanders attacks Donald Trump over proposed cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, disability fund
","Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders used Washington’s three biggest safety net programs to draw a sharp line between himself and President Donald Trump. At a CNN town hall, Sanders rebuked Trump for his promise not to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. ""And then he came forth with a budget — a trillion dollar cut in Medicaid, $500 billion to Medicare, and $72 billion for the Social Security Disability Fund,"" Sanders said Feb. 25. We looked at his numbers for all three budget proposals and found solid support for the first, slightly less for the second, and the least for the third. All of these reductions come with a standard caveat: They refer to future spending compared to the amount that would be spent under current law. So a budget can call for more dollars year after year, but if that’s less than what population growth and inflation and other factors would predict, both the White House and lawmakers refer to that as either savings or cuts (depending on which side of the debate they are on). The Sanders team told us the overall statement has to do with Trump’s FY 2019 budget plan. A White House budget is never more than a picture of a world the administration would like to see, because the final spending policy decisions are made by Congress. That’s especially true for this budget’s Medicaid provisions. Offered in February 2018, the proposal relied on replacing Obamacare subsidies and Medicaid with a block grant to the states, mirroring a plan that a few months earlier had stalled in the Senate. The White House plan included caps on the growth of Medicaid and the creation of a new grant program. Sorting out the net impacts on spending is tricky. Year to year, spending rises. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that Medicaid spending would fall by $1.3 trillion over the 10 years between 2019 and 2028, based on current law. On the other hand, the CBO said the new state grant program would get nearly $970 billion over the same period. A portion of that would go toward people helped by Medicaid today. ""The net effect of those changes is $954 billion in cuts,"" said senior policy director Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group with hawkish views on deficits. ""There are also modest cuts elsewhere in the program that could bring the number closer to $1 trillion."" ‘$500 billion’ from Medicare At first blush, America’s health insurance program for seniors and the disabled would get $472 billion less under Trump’s budget, according to the CBO. But some of those dollars come back through different doors. The biggest example involves paying hospitals and other providers for care they provide but never get paid for. The White House budget reduces payments by at least $100 billion, but that’s partly offset by a newly created uncompensated care pool worth $63 billion. There’s a similar dynamic with the budget line for graduate medical education. Those dollars flow to ""teaching hospitals,"" essentially places where new doctors continue their training. The White House trims the original budget line by $146 billion, but then proposes $139 billion for a fund that would cover this for both Medicare and Medicaid, which has a similar physician training provision. There’s still a cut between the two of $28 billion. The numbers don’t show exactly how much would fall on Medicare, but the net result is much smaller than first appears. Overall, ""the true cut is less than the $472 billion,"" said John Holahan, a fellow in the Health Policy Institute at the Urban Institute in Washington. Goldwein estimated the total cut at closer to $300 billion. And again, we note that actual dollars spent rise each year. It is worth noting that President Barack Obama also proposed Medicare cuts totalling $419 billion over 10 years. Trimming payments to providers was central to the Obama administration’s long-term strategy to keep Medicare financially balanced. The two single largest reductions proposed by Trump curtailed the dollars going to hospitals, which isn't the same as taking benefits away from Medicare recipients. The White House budget message itself provides the $72 billion reduction in disability payments that Sanders cited. But two-thirds of that might never come to pass. The White House counts $48 billion in savings from testing ""new approaches to increase labor force participation."" That refers to programs to keep people working, because if they work, those people won’t need disability payments. If those pilot efforts cut benefits regardless of whether people find work, then the cuts would be real. But Goldwein at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget is skeptical. ""These savings mostly won’t materialize,"" he said. The CBO doesn’t include the $48 billion savings in its analysis. Its tally shows about $15 billion in cuts for the disabled. The White House total also includes savings in the Social Security Supplemental Security Income fund, which is a separate program. Sanders said Trump proposed cuts of $1 trillion to Medicaid, $500 billion to Medicare and $72 billion to the Social Security Disability Fund. Numbers from the CBO and experts we reached confirmed the $1 trillion in Medicaid reductions. The Medicare reductions are less than Sanders said, probably in the range of $300 to $400 billion. While the White House might claim $72 billion in savings from the Social Security Disability Fund, the CBO put the number at about $15 billion. There’s no question Trump’s budget called for major reductions in Medicaid and Medicare spending from what would have been without changes in law or policy. Part of that plan reduced money going to hospitals and other providers, which is not the same as reducing benefits to recipients.

J.K. Rowling fell off Forbes billionaires list due to charitable donations, but she wasn’t the first
","J.K. Rowling, the prolific author of the wildly successful Harry Potter book series, is known for her inspiring rags to riches story.  Now, a meme going around Facebook is commending the author for her charitable contributions, claiming Rowling is the first billionaire to ever fall off Forbes’ billionaires list over her donations. The post, which features a picture of Rowling, says: ""Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling is the first billionaire to fall off Forbes’ billionaires list because of charitable giving."" It ends with this quote, presumably from Rowling, ""You have a moral responsibility when you’ve been given far more than you need, to do wise things with it and give intelligently."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This claim is partly accurate, in part because taxes are also a factor in her being removed from the list. . In 2011, Forbes estimated Rowling to be worth about $1 billion, with most of her money coming in from the Harry Potter book series and film franchise. She fell off the billionaires list a year later, after donating an estimated $160 million to various charities (about 16 percent of her net worth). Forbes reported that Britain’s high tax rates also contributed to her losing the billionaire status. The author’s income in 2018 is estimated to be around $54 million. The quote attributed to Rowling in the post seems to be legitimate as well -- it appears in a 2011 story by the Telegraph. But here’s the portion of the statement that is problematic: Rowling was not the first billionaire to fall off the list as a result of their charitable giving. Forbes reported that Jon Huntsman Sr. was bumped in 2010 due to donations to his cancer foundation and later made it back on the list. Rowling is well known for her charitable work and has supported the Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland, The Maggie’s Centres for Cancer Care, Doctors Without Borders, and more. She founded the Children’s High Level Group, known as Lumos, which works to ""end the systematic institutionalization of children across Europe and help them find safer, more caring places to live."" She has also contributed to various other charitable causes through her philanthropic trust, Volant. While Rowling wasn’t the first billionaire to fall of the list due to charitable donations, she was bumped off for doing so (along with paying high taxes), and is highly regarded for her philanthropic work.
