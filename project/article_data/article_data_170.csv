Roggensack says her Appeals Court caseload topped 2,400
","
Patience Roggensack’s campaign for re-election to Wisconsin’s highest court emphasizes her years on the bench as she competes against two lawyers with no judicial experience in the Feb. 19, 2013, primary.

The Supreme Court justice is airing a TV ad that puts some hard numbers on that selling point, reinforced by images of an NFL referee, a pilot and a surgeon on their nerve-racking early days on the job.

Roggensack appears on camera and says her 17 years of wearing a black robe is critical to doing her job. As she speaks, words appear on the screen:

""Supreme Court cases heard, over 550""

Then: ""Appellate cases heard: over 2,400.""

The first figure didn’t jump out at us -- after all, Roggensack is approaching 10 years on the high court.

But her Wisconsin Court of Appeals stint in Madison-based District 4 lasted only seven years (1996-2003). Did Roggensack really hear about 340 cases a year on average in that time?

When we asked Roggensack’s campaign for backup, its opening argument was unimpressive. We were told the number in the ad probably was off.

Campaign consultant Brandon Scholz said he came up with the 2,400 figure himself without a full understanding of court statistics. After a couple days of consulting with experts, though, he presented us with a number -- 2,500 -- based on an extrapolation from one year of case termination statistics from the whole of District 4.

The campaign could not provide a record of how many opinions Roggensack wrote, or orders she issued. Instead, it attributed to her a caseload figure that any of the five judges in District 4 would have had if cases were distributed equally among the judges.

Not a promising start, but we don’t render a verdict until all the evidence is in.

So we gave it our own review.

To evaluate her formula, we went over caseload figures for her entire tenure at District 4 and got up to speed on the appeals process.

Cases are randomly assigned and judges are given an equal number of cases to screen each month, we found, so it is reasonable to attribute a share of the district caseload to her in order to arrive at an educated guess.

And the cases come in droves, we found. During Roggensack’s tenure, she and the other four judges in District 4 disposed of about 7,400 cases. (Her tenure doesn’t match up to calendar years so the number is not precise.)

We concluded that Roggensack’s estimate is based on a reasonable formula that apportions her a share of the overall district caseload.

But there’s another way to do this: use the court’s internal record-keeping system to come up with a more precise count of cases she handled, rather than a pure estimate.

We asked for help from Judge Richard Brown, the chief judge of the Appeals Court.

Brown ran a report on how many case opinions Roggensack wrote or supervised. The final result still involved a bit of extrapolation, but we think it’s a harder count than the estimate provided by Roggensack’s campaign.

Brown’s count: 2,186 -- a figure that is in the ballpark with Roggensack’s general ""over 2,400"" claim.

The reality is there’s no indisputable count available.

Finally, it’s worth noting that Roggensack describes her workload as cases she ""heard."" That’s not a legal term, and it’s therefore a subjective matter to decide what it covers. But there are nuances here that require some clarification.

Roggensack counts several types of cases to get to ""over 2,400.""

She included cases in which the judges review legal briefs by the parties, decide the case, and then author or contribute to signed opinions.

And she counted cases in which judges decide but turn over the writing to staff attorneys, typically when decisions are deemed obvious and noncontroversial.

A large majority of the cases she takes credit for hearing are the type in which staff attorneys, not the judges, write the final legal ruling under judicial supervision.

There’s another nuance. About half of cases not authored by the judges result in orders known as summary dispositions, not full-blown written opinions.

For some perspective, we turned to Charles Dykman, a judge who served with Roggensack in District 4, which covers 24 counties in western and central Wisconsin. Dykman was presiding judge for much of Roggensack’s tenure there, which means he was actively involved in managing caseloads.

Dykman, who retired in 2010 after 32 years on the appeals bench, told us the only number he kept track of was majority opinions he authored -- about 1,900 over 32 years. That’s a much narrower way to view it than Roggensack chose.

Dykman said it was ""foolishness"" to equate complex cases heard by three-judge panels with minor summary disposition cases in which the appeal often lacked merit.

Still, Dykman said Roggensack could reasonably claim having ""heard"" those types of cases.

Finally, we note that the number Roggensack used did not include a relatively large category of decisions that appeals court judges make in motions that fall short of full-blown appeals. Some of those decisions are fairly complex and time-consuming, said Paul Lundsten, the current presiding judge in District 4.

Those, however, are not separate cases.

Our rating

Roggensack’s TV ad says she ""heard"" more than 2,400 cases as a Wisconsin appeals court judge. That’s over a seven-year span.

The figure turns out to be an estimate, not an actual count. A harder count put the number at 2,186, though it, too, includes some assumptions.

The count includes minor and major cases, and a large number in which the judge’s decision is written up by staff attorneys. But they are all cases reviewed and decided by the judge -- in essence ""heard"" -- and Roggensack made no claim that her number involved only judge-authored opinions.

So with the clarifications noted, we rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F91500>],/factchecks/2013/feb/17/patience-roggensack/roggensack-says-her-appeals-court-caseload-topped-/

Cory Booker says more minorities born in 2012 than racial majority
","
The growing diversity of America’s melting pot just may have made history, according to Cory Booker.

Newark’s mayor described the milestone during a Feb. 1 appearance on the ""Bill Maher Overtime"" show, where he was a guest panelist.

Booker claimed that 2012 was the ""first year in American history that more minorities are being born than people in the majority.""

It’s clear that the United States is a more diverse country than in the past, but Booker’s claim of history being made in 2012 is inaccurate.

Let’s first look at data from the U.S. Census Bureau and then the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics.

It’s important to note that each agency tracks data differently: the Census Bureau tracks population by race, but not births by race. The National Center for Health Statistics tracks births in whole numbers and percentages, and breaks down those numbers in multiple categories, including race.

In May 2012, the Census Bureau confirmed the milestone Booker referenced, but for the year 2011 -- not 2012.

""Last year we said (in a news release) 50.4 percent of our nation’s population younger than age 1 were minorities as of July 1, 2011,"" Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein told us. ""This is up from 49.5 percent from the 2010 census taken April 1, 2010. But in the news release we didn’t … look at the period any time before 2010, so we can’t confirm with 100 percent certainty that this is the first time ever so it may very well be true, that statement, but we can’t confirm that based on our written publication.""

Population and birth data for 2012 from the Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics won’t be available for several months, spokespeople for both agencies said.

Next, let’s look at birth data by race for the majority race of non-Hispanic whites and these minority groups: non-Hispanic black, American Indian or Alaska native, Asian or Pacific Islander, and Hispanic.

We looked at Vital Statistics Reports birth data going back to 2000 and found that the highest number of minority births – 2,005,890 – occurred in 2007. But that wasn’t more than the number of non-Hispanic whites that year: 2,310,333.

After 2007, the four years with the highest number of minority births, in order, occurred in 2008, 2006, 2009 and 2005, according to the data. Births of non-Hispanic whites, however, were still higher than minority births in each of those years.

We contacted Booker’s press office three times and asked for the source of his data, and we also shared our findings in an e-mail with his press office. We received no response, other than two e-mails acknowledging our requests for comment.

Our ruling

Booker claimed on ""Bill Maher Overtime"" that 2012 was the ""first year in American history that more minorities are being born than people in the majority.""

Since 2000, the highest number of minorities born in the United States was in 2007, at 2,005,890 – but there were 2,310,333 non-Hispanic whites also born that year. After reviewing 11 years worth of data, there was no other year in which the number of minority births was higher than that of the majority, non-Hispanic whites.

Looking strictly at population breakdowns by race, the Census Bureau said 2011 was the first time a majority of people in the United States younger than age 1 were minorities. Booker’s claim referenced that milestone, but with the wrong year. The mayor said it happened in 2012, but the Census Bureau said it occurred in 2011. Since Booker’s statistic was partially correct we rate his statement Half True.

Rep. Brian Patrick Kennedy suggests employers and schools are banned from monitoring workers in their cubicles and students in their dorm rooms
","
These days, it can be hard to figure out what is private and what is not.

At the same time people are concerned about the type of information collected by companies when they go on the Internet, people are also posting a lot of very personal information online via Facebook, Twitter and blogs.

State Rep. Brian Patrick Kennedy, a Democrat from Hopkinton, R.I., wants to put some limitations on how much private information you must reveal if you apply for a job or enroll in a school.

He is proposing legislation that would prohibit employers or schools from requesting social media information, including an applicant's personal username or password. For example, it would be illegal for an employer or education official to ask to be added to the applicant's Facebook friend's list.

It was this sentence in his news release that caught our eye, particularly the reference to employer rights: ""Employers and schools have no more right to this private information than they do in providing surveillance of a dorm room or a worker's cubicle.""

We were under the impression that employers had every right to keep an eye on you while on the job. If you use a company-owned computer on a company-owned network, for example, the company has the right to track every e-mail, every web-page visit, and even every keystroke you make on that machine.

So we decided to investigate.

We made two phone calls over two days to Kennedy asking him for his source. He never responded.

But if such monitoring is illegal, as Kennedy maintains, a lot of companies are already doing it.

We found a 2007 survey of 304 U.S. companies conducted by the American Management Association in which 7 percent said they use video surveillance to track employee's performance on the job.

But 48 percent reported that they use video monitoring to some degree to look for theft, violence and sabotage. Most of the time workers are informed of the surveillance, but not always.

Is it legal to monitor workers that way?

""In some workplaces, the answer is pretty clearly yes,"" said Michael Yelnosky, who specializes in labor law at Roger Williams University School of Law. In a private workplace with no union, placing a surveillance camera is no different from having a supervisor sit behind the worker and watching everything, he said.

""It might come out differently if there's a union in place,"" he said. ""The employer would have to bargain that issue before he went ahead and unilaterally made that change"" because it would be a change in working conditions.

The rules are a bit different if the employer is the government, he said. ""The Supreme Court has said you have some protections in the workplace against your public employer that you wouldn't have from your private employer because the Constitution prohibits some state invasions of privacy where it doesn't say anything about private employers.""

And there are other limitations. Rhode Island has an overall privacy law, passed in 1980, that protects against ""unreasonable intrusion upon one's physical solitude or seclusion,"" the ""appropriation of one's name or likeness,"" ""unreasonable publicity given to one's private life,"" and publicity that ""places another in a false light before the public.""

There is also a state law that deals specifically with privacy in the workplace; it has special rules regarding areas of the workplace where people might expect an extra degree of privacy, such as a bathroom or locker room.

In general, video monitoring of workplaces is allowed, but there are restrictions if you want to add sound to that surveillance.

""You have to give your consent to personal conversations,"" said Robert Ellis Smith, publisher of Privacy Journal, a 38-year-old monthly publication. ""If The [Providence] Journal were to install microphones in the city room, they can overhear business-related conversations. But once they turned personal, then the employer is not supposed to listen in. Rhode Island law pretty well tracks federal law [on this matter]. Courts have said employers have latitude to listen in on conversations, but they must be business related.""

The Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union's pamphlet on ""Your Rights to Workplace Privacy in Rhode Island,"" agrees that in most private workplaces, video surveillance is legal. But it is not legal if it's done to monitor employee activities related to the exercise of collective bargaining rights or the forming of a labor union.

While Rhode Island may not have a specific law about monitoring a cubicle or dorm room, said Steven Brown of the ACLU, the state’s general ""right to privacy"" law would apply.

Smith, of Privacy Journal, also said there is no ban on monitoring in dormitory rooms.

""They're the landlord,"" he said.

Installing a camera might be permissible, said Smith, however, ""there could be a lawsuit if it picked up nudity, near-nudity, and sensitive areas but there's no law on it either way. It goes to the content of what's being picked up and how sensitive it is.""

Audio surveillance in a dorm room would not be allowed without permission. ""It's only employers who have that latitude,"" said Smith.

We also checked with Brown University, where spokesman Mark Nickel said the university's lawyers are ""not aware of any legislation that either permits or forbids surveillance in dorm rooms. As a matter of well-established practice, Brown does not allow surveillance in private areas like dormitory rooms, and the general counsel's office is unaware of any college or university that does.""

Our ruling

State Rep. Brian Patrick Kennedy said: ""Employers and schools have no more right to this private [social media] information than they do in providing surveillance of a dorm room or a worker's cubicle.""

Kennedy didn’t return our phone calls seeking backup for his claim.

One could read his statement two ways. In one reading, Kennedy could be giving an opinion that employers shouldn’t have rights to that type of surveillance. PolitiFact doesn’t rule on opinions.

But in our reading of his news release, Kennedy is asserting a fact -- that employers and schools don’t have such rights.

From that standpoint, it is clear that state and federal law does not prohibit schools and employers -- with some important restrictions -- from monitoring workers and students on their property, although we can't imagine anyone, other than students wanting to be in some sort of reality TV series, being willing to move into a dorm where school officials can watch you in your room.

Kennedy’s statement has some element of fact -- there are existing protections in the law. But it ignores important facts that would give a different impression -- the right of employers and landlords to monitor workplaces and living spaces. We rate his claim Mostly False.

Do one in eight Oregon children and one in 18 adults suffer from mental illness?
","
Oregon Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem, doesn’t tend to throw his personal weight behind many public bills. That’s why the Oregon Capitol stood at attention when Courtney called for more money -- new money, dedicated money -- to pay for a game-changing boost in mental health services for children and adults.

In an accompanying press release, his office noted that: ""Statistics indicate that one in eight children, and one in 18 adults in Oregon suffers from mental illness. The Oregon Health Authority also reports that the state is currently serving less than half the adults and slightly more than one-third of the young people who need treatment.""

PolitiFact Oregon was skeptical. Those stats seem high.

The Senate president’s office directed us to the Oregon Health Authority. People there sent us to the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute, and specifically, to its State Data Infrastructure Coordinating Center. These people take census figures annually and apply a standard formula developed in the late 1990s to determine how many people have a ""serious mental illness"" or ""serious emotional disturbances.""

We thought the number of diagnosed cases might drive the statistic, but that’s not the way it works. Instead, the research institute applies a percentage to the civilian adult population -- in this case, 5.4 percent -- to derive the estimated number of people 18 years and older with a ""serious mental illness.""

The low side of the estimate is 3.7 percent and the upper side is 7.1 percent. In Oregon, 5.4 percent translates into more than 162,000 people out of 3 million adults. That translates into one in 18.5 adults.

Let’s move on to the claim that one in eight children suffers from mental illness.

Children are treated differently. The institute takes census numbers and applies a poverty formula, so a state that’s considered ""high poverty"" is calculated to have more children with a serious mental illness -- or in technical terms, ""serious emotional disturbances"" -- than states considered ""low poverty."" Oregon is a mid-poverty state.

The percentages do not vary dramatically among the types of states, 9 percent to 11 percent of children for a low poverty state and 11 percent to 13 percent for a high poverty state. In Oregon, an estimated 10 percent to 12 percent of children ages 9 to 17 have a serious emotional disturbance.  

Ten percent of Oregon children is one in 10. Twelve percent is one in 8.3. The average -- 11 percent -- is one in 9.1 children. Again, this is just for children ages 9 to 17, so the calculation doesn’t capture the entire range of children. Remember that Courtney’s claim is one in eight.

Now what do we mean by a serious emotional disturbance? Or rather, what do the experts mean?

We spoke with Dr. Ronald Manderscheid, executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors. He’s the person who developed the federal algorithm used to estimate the number of adults and children with mental illness or emotional disability. In other words, he’s a solid expert.

There is an assessment scale used routinely by mental health professionals. The spectrum spans from 1 to 10 to 91 to 100, and assesses how well a person functions. A child in the top bracket would be ""superior"" in every facet of life, and have a healthy sense of confidence and take problems in stride. The scale also applies to adults.

Anyone in the 51 to 60 bracket, or lower, is considered to have a serious emotional disturbance or mental illness.

Adults in this bracket would exhibit ""moderate symptoms,"" such as occasional panic attacks, or ""moderate difficulty"" in social, work or school settings. Children in this group would have ""sporadic difficulties or symptoms"" in several but not all social areas. Symptoms would appear in times of distress.

People in the 41 to 50 range would show ""serious symptoms,"" including frequent shoplifting or severe obsessive rituals, or ""serious impairment"" in social, work, or school settings. This person might have no friends or be unable to keep a job.

Children in the 41 to 50 bracket would show serious impairment in one area or moderate problems with functioning in most social areas. Children may have frequent anxiety attacks or have an unhealthy preoccupation with suicide.

The ""one in eight"" statistic cited by Courtney applies to children who top out at 60.

How many children do we have in Oregon, in that age group? An estimated 437,053 in 2011. Just to give you an idea, that means about 48,000 kids in the age bracket who fall within the accepted definition. Again, that’s an average of one in 9.1 kids.

We also talked with Bill Bouska, children’s mental health system manager, and Jon C. Collins, manager of health programs analysis and measurement, both at the Oregon Health Authority. We asked why go with the higher percentage?

""There’s not a lot of difference between 11 and 12 percent. These numbers are meant to be very general numbers, and to guide states,"" Collins said. ""They’re not meant to be precise figures, so picking something on the high side is a little bit safer than picking a number on the low side, since they are estimates.""

Let’s go to our ruling. Courtney’s office relied on national statistics to claim that one in 8 children and one in 18 adults suffer from mental illness in Oregon. We found those statistics and talked to the person responsible for calculating the federal formula used to derive those statistics.

We understand this is all about estimates, but if we’re going to boil it down to percentages, let’s see what they are. A 5.4 percent rate translates into one in 18.5 adults who suffer from a mental illness that makes functioning moderately difficult. Manderscheid, our national expert, says the percentage used now is 5.8 percent, which is one in 17.2 adults, so Courtney’s statement still rings true.

(The number of adults who suffer from a mental health disorder in a given year is much higher -- one in four -- but they take medication or receive treatment so condition doesn’t affect their ability to function.)

With children, we find that the one-in-eight statement is slightly more alarming than the average would indicate. The average in Oregon is one in 9.1 with a high of one in 8.3. It’s also important to understand that the statistic applies to a narrower subset of children, and that the statistic covers children who show sporadic difficulties in several but not all social areas..

Still, all in all, it’s hard to argue with a nationally accepted standard, so we find these details to be additional information missing from an otherwise accurate statement.  We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A71280>],/factchecks/2013/feb/16/peter-courtney/do-one-eight-oregon-children-and-one-18-adults-suf/
"['Alcohol', 'Rhode Island', 'Children', 'Drugs', 'Marijuana', 'Edith Ajello']","
Rhode Island State Rep. Edith Ajello says studies indicate minors find it easier to get marijuana than alcohol
","State Rep. Edith H. Ajello, D-Providence, recently said legalizing and regulating marijuana in Rhode Island would make it tougher for young people to get the drug, in part by cutting off the underground market that sells to minors and flourishes while marijuana is outlawed.

In a Feb. 6, 2013, Providence Journal story about her bill to legalize marijuana, Ajello said that after years of making marijuana illegal, ""Lots of studies seem to indicate that minors find it very easy to get marijuana, easier than to get alcohol.""

Ajello’s proposal calls for allowing people 21 or older to carry an ounce or less of marijuana and would require regulations for selling, growing and taxation of the drug.

We wondered if it’s really true, as Ajello says, that it’s easier for young people to get marijuana than alcohol.

After we contacted Ajello, we heard from Mason Tvert, an advocate for regulating the use of marijuana rather than prohibiting it. He referred us to various studies.

But we had already found the annual National Survey of American Attitudes on Substance Abuse, which reports that in each of the past three years, young people reported that  it was in fact easier to get alcohol than to get marijuana -- the opposite of what Ajello said.

The most recent edition of that survey, which is conducted by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, and released in August 2012, said ""teens have readier access to alcohol than prescription drugs or marijuana within an hour and within a day.""

Tvert mentioned the same study, noting that from 2002 through 2009 it found that teens thought it was easier to buy marijuana than beer. But, in 2010, the survey changed the wording of the question, asking teenagers whether it was easier to get marijuana than alcohol -- the wording Ajello used.

From 2010 through 2012, the survey states, 26 to 27 percent of teenagers said they could get beer within an hour while 13 to 15 percent of teens said they could get marijuana within an hour.

During the same three-year period, the range for teens who said they could get beer within a day was 46 to 50 percent, while for marijuana within a day it was 29 to 31 percent. (More teens also said they could illegally get prescription drugs within an hour or a day than marijuana).

Why did the wording change?

""Research suggested that teens frequently get substances including tobacco, alcohol and drugs from friends and families,"" rather than buying them, said Emily Feinstein, program director, Policy to Practice, at the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.

Indeed, another study, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, states that 7.7 percent of people ages 12 to 20 in 2011 said that they purchased the alcohol themselves the last time they drank. A little more than 30 percent of that age group said they paid for the the last alcohol they drank. (The study didn’t ask teens about the ease of purchasing marijuana.)

And the Monitoring the Future study, which is conducted at the University of Michigan and has surveyed about 50,000 8th, 10th and 12th graders in the United States yearly since the 1970s, has found that alcohol access is consistently reported by students in all three grades to be the number-one substance that is ""fairly easy"" or ""very easy"" to get.

Monitoring the Future’s 2012 survey found:

* Nearly 58 percent of 8th graders said it was fairly easy or very easy to get alcohol compared with 37 percent saying the same of marijuana

* More than 78 percent of 10th graders said alcohol was fairly easy or very easy to get while just shy of 69 percent said the same of marijuana.

* Almost 91 percent of 12th graders said alcohol was fairly easy or very easy to get compared with nearly 82 percent saying the same for marijuana.

Monitoring the Future found that students in the three grade levels said every year that alcohol was more easily available than marijuana. According to the Monitoring the Future survey figures, availability of alcohol has decreased since the 1990s -- but so has marijuana availability.

Other studies suggested by Tvert did not address directly teens’ ease of access to marijuana or alcohol. Those studies did say that in the past few years there has been an increase in marijuana use among teenagers, after a period in which use had declined.

Our ruling

Rep. Edith H. Ajello said, ""Lots of studies seem to indicate that minors find it very easy to get marijuana, easier than to get alcohol.""

The verb choice and timing of Ajello’s comment proved crucial here. If she’d referred to how easily young people could purchase one or the other, and she’d said it in 2009, there would be more support.

But all the most recent, credible, national studies we found showed that teenagers report it’s easier to get alcohol than marijuana.

We rate the claim as False.

Ted Cruz said he has repeatedly praised Chuck Hagel's public service
","
U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who has drawn fire from Democrats for his questions of Chuck Hagel, maintains that critics overlook his positive references to Hagel, the former two-term Nebraska senator nominated for secretary of Defense.

At Hagel’s confirmation hearings, Cruz employed video clips of Hagel being interviewed by Al-Jazeera to suggest the nominee espoused views hostile to Israel, Politico summarized Feb. 14, 2013, and during a committee vote, Cruz criticized Hagel’s failure to reveal details of his personal compensation from 2008 to 2010, asking whether North Korean sources may have funneled $200,000 to the defense nominee.

The senator’s questions are not attacks, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier later said, according to a Feb. 14, 2013, post on the Dallas Morning News’ Trailblazers blog. Frazier continued: ""Sen. Cruz has repeatedly praised Chuck Hagel’s character, patriotism, bravery, and personal service defending our nation — at the confirmation hearing, in writing, and at the committee hearing casting his vote on Senator Hagel’s nomination.""

He has?

President Barack Obama announced his nomination of Hagel, a Vietnam War veteran and former newscaster who served as a Republican senator through early 2009, on Jan. 7, 2013.

The Morning News report opened by saying that Cruz, a freshman Republican, was being likened by critics to Joe McCarthy, the late Wisconsin senator whose crusade against communists in government devolved into doubts about his legitimacy.

On Feb. 12, 2013, as the Senate Armed Services Committee approved Hagel’s nomination on a 14-11 party line vote, the News said, Cruz suggested that Hagel had taken money under the table from adversaries. ""We do not know, for example, if he received compensation for giving paid speeches at extreme or radical groups,"" Cruz said before the committee vote. ""It is at a minimum relevant to know if that $200,000 that he deposited in his bank account came directly from Saudi Arabia, came directly from North Korea.""

Cruz demanded financial disclosures from Hagel covering five years, three more than required, the News reported, and the Texan said that without that, the ""only reasonable inference"" is that ""there was something in there that they did not want to make public.""

At the hearing, Politico reported, Sens. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and John McCain, R-Ariz., rebuked Cruz for ""what they considered an unfair line of questioning allegedly impugning Hagel’s patriotism.""

Nelson chastised Cruz for violating standards of ""comity and civility that this committee has always been known for….To question in essence whether somebody is a fellow traveler with another country, I think is taking it too far….You basically have impugned the patriotism of the nominee.""

Subsequently, the News said, left-leaning pundits compared Cruz’s statement to those aired during the 1950s Red Scare – intimidation by insinuation. Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., referred to Cruz’s assertions as ""innuendo"" that lacked factual basis. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., made an allusion to McCarthy, recalling a time when senators would make insinuations by claiming to have a speech someone once made in his pocket, casting aspersions without producing evidence. ""It was reminiscent of some bad times,"" she said, according to the News.

By email, Frazier told us that Cruz’s praise of Hagel shows up in video of the committee proceedings, committee transcripts and published articles by Cruz.

Cruz’s Jan. 7, 2013, USA Today opinion column opens by calling Hagel a ""war hero and public official who has served America honorably. However,"" it continues, ""his views on foreign and defense policy are out of the mainstream, and he is not a good fit for secretary of Defense."" The remaining 280 words give reasons not to back Hagel.

A Cruz opinion column posted by Politico on Feb. 1, 2013, opens: ""Chuck Hagel is a decorated Vietnam veteran with an honorable history fighting for his country, and I commend his personal valor and sacrifice."" The rest of the 800-word article covers Cruz concerns about the nominee.

Cruz praised Hagel in two moments during meetings of the Armed Services committee.

On Jan. 31, 2013, according to a hearing transcript, Cruz prefaced his questioning of Hagel by saying: ""I want to begin by thanking you for your honorable service to our nation, for your personal sacrifice that you have put in to standing and fighting for this country."" And on Feb. 12, Cruz prefaced his echo of a newspaper saying Hagel’s foreign policy views put him on the Senate’s fringe by saying: ""And Sen. Hagel, although I very much respect his personal heroism and character and service, putting his life on the line defending this nation,"" according to a transcript.

Cruz separately issued press releases questioning Hagel’s nomination on Jan. 7 and Feb. 14, 2013. The combined 324 words include no praise.

Our ruling

Cruz’s office says he has ""repeatedly praised"" Hagel’s ""character, patriotism, bravery, and personal service defending our nation.""

We found four instances, but in each one--and in others where he aired no praise--Cruz hammered what he calls Hagel’s shortcomings so much so that some colleagues cried foul. The missing context of this claim is that every time, Cruz's praise has been overshadowed by pointed questions and/or critiques.

Barack Obama says the 12 hottest years on record have come in the last 15 years
","
During his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama touted the country’s progress in reducing carbon pollution emissions but added that recent advances in fuel efficiency and renewable energy have not done enough to curb climate change.

""For the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change,"" Obama said. ""Now, it’s true that no single event makes a trend. But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods – all are now more frequent and more intense.""

In 2012, the country experienced severe weather threats including drought, a devastating Hurricane Sandy and severe thunderstorms. We decided to fact-check whether the 12 hottest years on record have all come since 1998.

The White House directed us to NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which tracks global surface temperatures. The institute concluded that 2012 was the ninth-warmest year on record, with 2010 and 2005 being the all-time highs.

For the contiguous United States, 2012 was the country’s warmest year yet. It beat the previous record by one degree Fahrenheit. (Science nerds can read more about how these temperatures are calculated here and here.)

Reto Ruedy, a program manager at the Goddard Institute, told PolitiFact that the institute’s data produces the following ranking of hottest years. Items on the same line are statistically tied.

1-2: 2010, 2005
3-8: 2007, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2009
9-12: 2012, 2011, 2001, 2004
13: 2008
14: 1997
15: 1995

This analysis shows that 13 of the warmest years have occurred in the past 15 years. Alternately, one could say that 12 of the warmest years came in the last 13.

We see a few other issues to note.

• The NASA data set isn’t the only one available. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also analyzes global surface temperatures using its own methodology. The two measurements diverge somewhat -- NOAA considers 2012 the 10th-warmest year on record since records began in 1880, rather than the ninth.

However, NOAA’s data for land and ocean temperature anomalies shows that 14 of the past 15 years were the hottest on record.

• There are other ways one could measure ""hottest years."" Kevin Trenberth, a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, agreed with the 13-of-15 calculation. But he added that the NASA and NOAA values refer to global mean surface temperature. ""One could define ‘hottest’ in other ways, such as by how much Arctic sea ice there is,"" he said.

Our ruling

Obama said, ""The 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15."" Data from NASA shows 13 of the hottest years on record have come in the last 15, and by a different data set produced by NOAA, 14 of the hottest years on record have come in the last 15.

Wisconsin regulations ranked ""worst in the world"" for mining, business group says
","With the prospect of thousands of jobs being created in northern Wisconsin, Republican legislators and business leaders are once again leading a push for changes to the state’s mining laws.

Gogebic Taconite has continued to express interest in spending $1.5 billion to open an iron ore mine in far northwestern Wisconsin. Before it proceeds, the company wants lawmakers to write new laws specifically for iron mining that would relax some environmental rules and provide greater certainty about the regulatory process.

A bill to accommodate Gogebic narrowly died in 2012 and with Republicans back in control of both houses and the governor’s office, a renewed campaign to secure passage is under way. Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business group, has aggressively pushed for the bill’s approval.

In interviews and public hearing testimony, the group’s chief lobbyist, Scott Manley, has spent months trying to put Wisconsin’s mining laws into perspective. At a Jan. 23, 2013, public hearing before a joint legislative committee considering mining legislation, Manley had this to say about the need for mining legislation:

""A recent survey of 500 mining companies throughout the world by the Fraser Institute … found alarming evidence that Wisconsin’s environmental regulations and regulatory framework discourage investment in mining jobs.

""For example, of the 79 states and countries analyzed in the survey, Wisconsin’s environmental regulations ranked the worst in the world for mining investment.  Eighty-five percent of the respondents characterized Wisconsin’s environmental laws as either a ‘strong deterrent to investment’ or ‘would not invest due to this factor.’ The Fraser Institute survey diagnoses a significant problem with Wisconsin’s mining laws.""

Manley has made similar statements in the past, including a Nov. 30, 2012, interview with talk show host Charlie Sykes, and in a Nov. 24, 2012, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel opinion piece.

So, is Wisconsin really worst in the world for mining investment?

Let’s start with the study.

Since 1997, the Fraser Institute, an independent Canadian think tank, has taken a look at the state of the mining industry around the world. The group says it conducts ""an annual survey of metal mining and exploration companies to assess how mineral endowments and public policy factors such as taxation and regulation affect exploration investment. Survey results represent the opinions of executives and exploration managers in mining and mining consulting companies operating around the world.""

The survey Manley cites is Fraser’s 2010-11 report. The results were gathered between Oct. 19 and Dec. 3, 2010. That time frame overlapped the election for governor won by Republican Scott Walker, but  was well before discussion on mining legislation heated up.

There have also been two reports issued since then -- and those reports don’t include Wisconsin. So, Manley is picking an outdated report to make his point.

What’s more, it is a survey. The results are determined by whoever chooses to respond. It is not scientific. So, the conclusions you can draw from it are limited.

In the survey in question, Fraser sent it to 3,000 mining and exploration firms and executives, and received responses from 494, or about 16.5 percent.

All told, the responses addressed the economic and political climates for mining in 79 regions around the world. That underlines how the results are dictated by who responded, not by any effort to represent all states or countries in a proportional way. Nor does it require any particular knowledge of how one state’s regulations compare to, say, another country’s regulations.

The findings, when listed as the top 10 and bottom 10 geographic regions, were pretty grim for Wisconsin.

""The bottom 10 scorers are Indonesia, Zimbabwe, Wisconsin, Madagascar, India, Guatemala, Bolivia, DRC (Congo), Venezuela, and Honduras,"" the report said. ""Unfortunately, except for Wisconsin these are all developing nations which most need the new jobs and increased prosperity mining that can produce.""

The report included two comments about Wisconsin. In each case, the respondent is described only in vague terms.

""Make everyone do without any mining products for a month or a year in Wisconsin. Outlaw all mining materials.
— Producer company with more than US $50M revenue, Senior management""
           
""Wisconsin properly evaluates the economic impact of mineral development to job growth and economic stability.
— Consulting company, Consultant""

So how did Wisconsin wind up so low on the list?

Fraser conducts its surveys anonymously, and keeps most of the raw data secret. However, there are indications that few of the responses pertained to Wisconsin. And the responses received about Wisconsin were strongly negative about the economic and policy climate for mining in the state.

Some examples:

-- One key question -- asking for a rating for regions that had the ""most/least favorable policies toward mining"" -- received only 13 responses about Wisconsin. That is based on a  raw number (one of the few provided) that was included in a spreadsheet accompanying the report. Wisconsin received no ""most favorable"" votes, and 13 ""least favorable.""

That compares with 116 responses for Quebec, deemed the most favorable region, and 68 for Venezuela, the least favorable.

-- Fraser dropped Wisconsin from its two subsequent surveys, for 2011-12, as well as the soon-to-be-released 2012-13 study, according to the group’s survey coordinator, Alana Wilson. Regions are dropped when there are fewer than 10 respondents for that area.

-- Asked about ""uncertainty concerning the administration, interpretation and enforcement of existing regulations,"" 88 percent said Wisconsin’s situation was negative for investment in mining, while 12 percent said state rules were either a mild deterrent or no deterrent to such investment.

In short, the responses about Wisconsin were heavily negative and appear to have come from as few as 13, or 2.6 percent, of the 494 responses received by Fraser in 2010. (A spokesman said executives from Gogebic did not participate in the survey.)

Manley said in an interview he was unaware of the details about the Fraser survey, other than that it was sent to about 3,000 mining industry officials. He said he didn’t know about the small sample size or that Wisconsin was dropped from subsequent surveys.

""The people that they are asking are the people who are interested in making that investment or not"" in mining, Manley said. ""I can’t think of another survey that has the breadth of taking the pulse of the mining industry.""

Manley said the survey results were consistent with the situation in Wisconsin, at least in terms of mining regulations, and history.

He said that the current state law, in effect since 1998, amounts to a ""mining moratorium"" because it sets unreasonably high standards for establishment of a new mine. Also, he said, only one mine has received a permit under the existing state law. Dating to 1974, the Flambeau mine near Ladysmith that operated for a short time and is now closed. (Lead miners were active in the 1800s, including some before the state was established. Besides Flambeau, other mines operated but not under modern regulations.)  

Manley said the Fraser report puts Wisconsin in the same group as developing countries and ""from our standpoint it underscores the need for reform.""

Our rating

WMC says Wisconsin is among the ""worst in the world"" for mining investment, according to a study by a Canadian think tank. To be sure, the state landed in the bottom 10, along with numerous developing countries and no other U.S. states.

But the methodology behind the report illustrates the flaws in using it to make sweeping comparisons. A small number of people familiar with Wisconsin answered -- so small that the state was dropped from subsequent surveys.

We rate the claim Mostly False.

"['Georgia', 'Paul Broun']","
Broun touts pinning 'socialist' label on Obama
","U.S. Rep. Paul Broun has never been known as a wilting flower. During his time in the U.S. House, the Georgia Republican has become known for his strong, conservative opinions and controversial statements involving evolution.

Those strong positions were on full display in a recent fundraising letter to donors that surfaced this week. In soliciting funds for his run for the Senate seat being vacated by Saxby Chambliss, Broun criticized President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and alleged their policies are ruining the country.

""I was the first member of Congress to call him a socialist who embraces Marxist-Leninist policies like government control of health care and redistribution of wealth,"" Broun says of Obama in the letter.

PolitiFact Georgia sets the bar high when someone says they’re the ""first"" to make a particular statement, so we researched the claim to see if Broun’s bar should be lowered.  

Stories about Broun’s letter were published earlier this week by other news outlets and political pundits across the state.

The conservative political blog Georgia Tipsheet called the letter ""a predictably confrontational fundraising appeal"" and noted that Broun was among the earliest to attach the (socialist) barb to Obama. The liberal blog Daily Kos called Broun’s letter ""crackpot haiku.""

In August 2009, Broun told an audience at North Georgia Technical College that Obama -- along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Reid -- were members of a ""socialist elite,"" while deriding Obamacare (what critics call the national health care law). Then, in January 2011, after Obama delivered his State of the Union address, Broun said in a Twitter post that the president did not believe in the Constitution, and instead ""You believe in socialism.""

Broun compared Obama’s policies to those of Hitler or a Marxist dictator in November 2008, but apologized a week later for making the statements. ""The point I tried to make is that he is extremely liberal, he has promoted a lot of socialistic ideas, and it just makes me concerned,"" Broun told an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter at the time.

Obama’s socialist moniker doesn’t stop with Broun.

In October 2008, then-Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain accused Obama of pursuing a ""socialist"" agenda for telling blue-collar worker Joe the Plumber during a campaign stop that spreading the wealth around is good for everybody. That same month, then-Ohio U.S. Sen. George Voinovich told a newspaper reporter, ""(Obama) is left of Teddy Kennedy. With all due respect, the man is a socialist.""

PolitiFact has examined before whether Obama is a socialist, a claim made by Texas Gov. Rick Perry. We ruled that claim Pants on Fire.

But we’re ruling on a different claim here: whether Broun was the first to place the ""socialist"" label on the president. So was Broun’s claim accurate?

We called and emailed questions about the letter to Broun’s staff for comment, but received no response.

PolitiFact Georgia found that Broun’s socialist name-calling goes back to 2009 when he said the president was a member of the ""socialist elite,"" and in 2011 said the president believed in socialism. But one of Broun’s congressional colleagues, Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio, called Obama a socialist in October 2008; and Sen. John McCain of Arizona criticized Obama’s ""socialist"" agenda during that same month.

Based on our research, Broun was not the first member of Congress to specifically call Obama a socialist. In November 2008, Broun did compare Obama’s policies to those of Hitler or a Marxist dictator. Philosopher Karl Marx is described historically as a revolutionary socialist, and Hitler was head of the National Socialist German Workers Party.

But even that criticism was made a month after other congressional members lobbed their socialist charges.

Congress consists of both the U.S. House and U.S. Senate, and Obama was called a ""socialist"" by an Ohio senator a year before Broun actually used the term ""socialist.""

We rated Broun’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097704F40>],/factchecks/2013/feb/15/paul-broun/broun-touts-pinning-socialist-label-obama/
"['Labor', 'Workers', 'Texas', 'Sacramento Bee Editorial Board']","
Sacramento Bee editorial says Texas is last in workers’ compensation coverage
","
Taking umbrage at Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s campaign to lure California businesses, the Sacramento Bee swiped at Texas in an editorial stating that among its shortcomings, Texas is last in workers’ compensation coverage.

Workers’ compensation coverage ensures employees get paid if they’re injured on the job, or that in work-related deaths, their families receive benefits. Before states started passing such laws in 1911, workers’ main recourse was to sue their employers, who usually won in court.

Stuart Leavenworth, who edits the Bee’s editorial page, offered as a basis for this claim a February 2011 report, ""Texas on the Brink,"" issued by a Texas House caucus called the Legislative Study Group. The basis for the report’s ranking on ""workers’ compensation coverage"" was 2006 data on the percentage of workers covered in each state that came from the National Academy of Social Insurance, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit group that researches such issues.

And herein lies an important anomaly: Texas is the only state that does not require all employers to obtain workers’ compensation coverage. Experts we consulted agreed this is the reason why Texas consistently ranks last and well behind other states in the proportion of workers covered.

There are exceptions; the National Federation of Independent Business says in an online comparison of such state laws that those include government construction contracts. In those cases, workers can file compensation claims, a right that employees usually give up in workers’ compensation agreements, ""if they think they have a genuine case and the employer is still refusing to pay monetary benefits,"" the summary says. And other states exempt certain employers.

The academy’s most recent data on the percentage of workers covered in each state comes from 2010. As charted in an August 2012 report, it shows that while Texas had 78.6 percent of workers covered, no other state had less than 94.9 percent covered. Thirteen states -- including California -- had 100 percent covered.

Amy Lee, a Texas Department of Insurance expert on workers’ compensation at the Texas Department of Insurance, told us by email, ""The 2012 estimate is that 19 percent of private Texas employees do not have (workers’ compensation) coverage,"" citing her agency’s 2012 analysis of employer participation in the Texas workers’ compensation system.

Next, we wondered if there were other ways to rate states on their workers’ compensation coverage. Distinctions can include types of injury covered and differences in benefits paid. And going by some of them, Texas is not last in the nation. For example, division executive for state relations Lori Lovgren of the National Council on Compensation Insurance, which gathers and analyzes data on workers’ compensation, emailed us a 2012 report showing Texas ranked 38th in the business-friendly ranking of lowest cost to employers.

Jennifer Wolf, executive director of an association representing state and provincial workers’ compensation systems in the U.S. and Canada, told us by email she would say there can be ""quite a bit of difference"" between states, especially ""when you are comparing different types of benefits (temporary, permanent partial, permanent total)."" Wolf’s group, the International Association of Industrial Accident Boards and Commissions, is based in Madison, Wis.

Wolf and Lee said that most states’ systems have gradually come into line with a set of federal recommendations issued in 1972. Wolf said the most recent check on compliance with those guidelines was a Jan. 1, 2004, report from a branch of the U.S. Department of Labor. States averaged compliance with 12.83 of the 19 recommendations, the report said; Texas’ compliance was slightly below average, at 12.5.

So the most significant difference between the states that we found is Texas’ voluntary system, under which 81 percent of private-sector workers get coverage not dissimilar to that across the country.

Of the 19 percent in Texas that do not have government-mandated coverage, Lee said, ""most have access to some sort of occupational benefits plan by their employer. The rest have no coverage.""

Rick Levy, legal director of the Texas AFL-CIO labor federation, said the alternative coverage offered by employers not subscribing to Texas’ system can offer ""far inferior"" benefits. ""The fact that so many workers lack coverage at all really sets us apart from everybody.""

Our ruling

The Bee said Texas is last in workers’ compensation coverage. Under state law, Texas remains the only U.S. state in which such coverage isn’t mandatory for all employers. And in 2010, 81 percent of Texas workers had such coverage, while nearly all workers were covered in the other states.

The editorial’s statement is True.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama says health care law is already slowing down Medicare costs
","In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama warned those who love Medicare that changes to the program are needed, because rising health care costs for seniors are ""the biggest driver of our long-term debt.""

If changes aren’t made, Obama warned, ""our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations.""

Obama said he was open to changes such as asking wealthier seniors to pay more, and paying hospitals and doctors to be more efficient. But he also took credit for his signature health care law.

""Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs,"" he said.

From our previous fact-checking, we know that many of the major provisions of the 2010 health care law have yet to take effect. So how can the law already be slowing the growth of health care costs? We decided to check it out.

Slowing spending

As Obama made his speech, the White House posted slides on its website to back up Obama’s key points.

For his health care comment, a chart showed Medicare spending projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, both before the passage of the Affordable Care Act and afterward. The chart shows the future growth noticeably slowing after the law’s passage. (View the chart here.) The numbers were part of the CBO's regular update on the country’s economic outlook and the federal budget. We reviewed the latest numbers, which were released on Feb. 5, 2013, as well as news coverage of the findings.

In its report, the CBO says that health care spending has grown much more slowly in recent years, both for federal programs and overall, than it did in previous years. In response to that slowing growth, the CBO reduced its projections for future Medicare spending. Since March 2010, the CBO has lowered its projections for Medicare spending in 2020 by roughly 15 percent, the report said.

However, the CBO did not specifically credit the Affordable Care Act as the reason for lowering the projections. Some aspects of the law, the report said, will slightly increase federal outlays in Medicare and Medicaid.

But the CBO did say it was revising estimates based on actual reduced growth in health care spending since at least 2010.

Health care law phasing in

As we noted above, the health care law isn’t fully in effect yet. A new requirement for Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty won't take effect until 2014, for example.

For the Medicare program, the law includes both spending and cost savings.

Beneficiaries can now receive expanded prescription drug coverage and preventive care without co-pays under the law; but those benefits increase costs.

On the other hand, the law has also put in place limits on payments to private insurance companies that operate the Medicare Advantage program, which saves money. Changes in payments to hospitals have also already started. That means financial incentives for hospitals that are more efficient and penalties for those that are not.

When we asked White House staff for more evidence to support Obama’s comments, they pointed us to a January memo from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which specifically pointed to limits on Medicare Advantage and changes to hospital payments.

Finally, a controversial Medicare payments commission -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- would make recommendations to make payments more efficient, reducing spending. But that board hasn’t yet convened, and it may never convene if Medicare meets pre-determined budget targets.

Trends in health care spending

Getting back to health care costs, it’s clear that the growth in spending is going down, both for overall health spending and Medicare. But what’s driving it? We found that experts consider it something of an interesting puzzle.

Some blame the recession and the economy. When people feel poor, they don’t spend as much, even on health care. Under this scenario, health care spending will rebound when the economy is better.

Others say the overall health care system is changing, moving away from payments for each procedure and test, and moving toward payments for better overall outcomes. The health care law includes provisions to encourage that switch. If this is the case, reduced spending growth should become permanent.

We found a diversity of opinion on what’s going on here, and whether Obama’s comment was accurate.

""Medicare spending slowed down in 2010-12, so this is not just a projection,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. ""Much of the law is not yet implemented, yet some Affordable Care Act provisions to control Medicare spending -- like changes in what Medicare Advantage plans are paid -- are already in effect, and were expected to produce savings during 2011-12.""

Other experts are dubious that the law is having much effect at all, such as Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a domestic policy staffer on health care issues for President George W. Bush.

""The reduction in overall health costs has had above all to do with the weak economy, and while CBO does suggest that its projections of the effects of the Affordable Care Act have changed in a few ways since it passed in 2010 (causing both upward and downward revisions of the effects on costs), those are all projections for after 2014, when the key substantive provisions of the law will take effect,"" he said. ""None of them could be used to suggest that ‘already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.’""

The Obama administration argues that it’s more than a weak economy driving reductions in spending. ""The economic recession may have contributed to the 2010-12 decrease in growth in per beneficiary spending as consumers use less care due to its cost,"" says the HHS memo. ""However, as almost all Medicare beneficiaries have supplemental coverage and thus face relatively low out-of-pocket costs, it seems unlikely that consumer behavior alone is responsible for the slow growth in Medicare spending.""

Deborah Chollet, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research, said the health care system is responding to the new law already. Insurance companies and other payers know about the new payment methods the law supports, and they are planning accordingly, she said.

""It’s really not at all a situation of the lights turning on Jan. 1, 2014. The lights have been on for the past six months,"" she said.

Still, determining causes behind the spending slowdown is no easy task, warned Bradley Herring, professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University.

""I think most people think the slowdown we’ve seen in health care spending over the last three years has been due to the recession. But no one’s 100 percent sure why that happened,"" he said.

Things will get even more complicated for health policy researchers as the law deploys changes to payments and other pilot programs. Researchers will have to hypothesize how much costs decline compared with if the law had not passed.

""Those are going to be difficult things to measure,"" Herring said.

We’ll close with comments from Douglas Elmendorf, head of the Congressional Budget Office. He spoke to reporters when the office released new numbers on Feb. 5:

""So, health spending has grown slowly over the past few years, both in federal programs and in the rest of the health care systems. We think that part of that owes to the recession and the loss of income in wealth, but we think that a significant part of that probably does not stem from the recession, probably arises from structural changes in the health care system.

""The critical question is, whether those structural changes are very transitory changes or whether they will persist. We're doing analysis to that question. We're talking with outside experts who are also investigating the same question. I think the short summary of that is that we don't know.""

Our ruling

Obama said, ""Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.""

He’s right that health care costs are slowing, but there’s not conclusive evidence that the law is helping. The nonpartisan reports from the Congressional Budget Office don’t specifically say that, and some aspects of the health law translate to increased spending.

Among health care experts, we found debate over how much the Affordable Care Act is contributing to an overall slowdown in health spending. Some argue that the recession is making people spend less on health care. Others say the health care system is changing to become more efficient. Many say that more study is needed.

Obama says he and Romney agreed on indexing minimum wage
","
In his State of the Union address this week, President Barack Obama proposed an increase to the federal minimum wage, from the current $7.25 an hour to $9.

And lest anyone hasten to cast that as a partisan proposal, Obama claimed to have support on the idea from an unlikely source: former presidential rival Mitt Romney.

""Working folks shouldn't have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up, while CEO pay has never been higher. So here's an idea that Gov. Romney and I actually agreed on last year: Let's tie the minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on,"" Obama said.

We know from last year’s dogged fight for the White House that Obama and Romney agreed on very little. But what about the minimum wage? We decided to check it out.

Running for Senate

Romney first expressed support for the idea of an indexed wage increase back in 1994, when he ran for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts against Ted Kennedy.

(Indexing the minimum wage means pegging it to a common measure of inflation, such as the Consumer Price Index. The idea is that when prices overall go up, the minimum wage would go up, too. Obama used the term ""the cost of living"" to refer to inflation, but the concepts here are the same.)

Kennedy criticized Romney for opposing a 30-cent increase to the minimum wage, which was then $4.25 an hour. In defense, he said he favored increasing it even more by tying it to inflation.

""I think the minimum wage ought to keep pace with inflation. I think the minimum wage is a good thing to have in our economy and I think it ought to be updated. We've had some inflation since the time it was set at $4.25 in April 1991, so I think an inflationary increase is appropriate,"" he said at the time.

Inflation had risen about 11 percent over the previous three years, so Romney's plan would have boosted the minimum wage by about 45 cents.

 As Massachusetts governor

In 2006, Romney vetoed a bill passed by the Massachusetts legislature to raise the state’s minimum wage to $8 an hour over two years. Again, he defended the decision by asserting that the wage should increase modestly and regularly and be indexed to inflation.

He sent the plan back to lawmakers with a proposal to hike the minimum wage from $6.75 to $7 an hour, and study further increases every two years.

His spokesman told the Boston Globe, ""The governor is not opposed to a minimum-wage increase, but he thinks it should be in line with inflation, so that's what he has put on the table. This is logical and consistent with what the governor has supported in the past.""

Running for president

At a New Hampshire campaign event in January 2012, Romney was asked about his stance on raising the minimum wage.

""My view has been to allow the minimum wage to rise with the CPI (Consumer Price Index) or with another index so that it adjusts automatically over time,"" he said.

The interviewer followed up, asking, ""So you’d support that as president?""

""I already indicated that when I was governor of Massachusetts, and that’s my view,"" he responded.

He confirmed in February that his opinion had not changed, which drew quick criticism from conservative players such as Steve Forbes, the Wall Street Journal editorial page and the Club for Growth.

Romney’s positioned shifted a bit after that. In a March interview on CNBC he conceded that the timing wasn’t right to raise the minimum wage during an economic recovery:

""On a regular basis, I said in the proposal I made (as governor of Massachusetts), every two years, we should look at the minimum wage, we should see what’s happened to inflation, we should also look at the jobs level throughout the country, unemployment rate, competitive rates in other states or, in this case, other nations.

""So, certainly, the level of inflation is something you should look at, and you should identify what’s the right way to keep America competitive. So that would tell you that right now, there’s probably not a need to raise the minimum wage.""

Our ruling

Obama said that tying the minimum wage to the cost of living is something he and Romney ""actually agreed on.""

As far back as 1994, Romney favored this approach. He reiterated it in 2006 while governor of Massachusetts, and again as the Republican nominee for president last year. Under criticism on the national stage, he did back away slightly from that position given the fragile economy in 2012.

None of this is to say that Romney would support Obama’s current proposal to boost the minimum wage to $9 an hour. But Obama was on firm ground claiming that at least for most of Romney’s political career, the former rivals were in agreement on indexing the wage. We rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ACFE80>],/factchecks/2013/feb/14/barack-obama/obama-says-he-and-romney-agreed-indexing-minimum-w/

Florida sheriff says state association 'unequivocally' supports the ‘stand your ground’ law
","Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law has been controversial both statewide and nationally since the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager. But Florida legislators show no sign of backing away from it. The Florida House Criminal Justice Subcommittee rejected a repeal of the law during a five-hour meeting Nov. 7, 2013. The hearing was led by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, who had previously vowed not to change ""one damn comma"" of the law. At the hearing, supporters and critics lined up to speak about the law. Among the supporters are sheriffs, said Okaloosa County Sheriff Larry Ashley. ""Florida sheriffs unequivocally support this, the right to stand your ground,"" said the sheriff from northwest Florida. Ashley said that the ""stand your ground"" law expanded the ""castle doctrine"" -- the right for people to defend themselves at home -- to other places, including their neighborhood and the mall. ""Florida sheriffs stand behind this law and oppose the repeal of it,"" said Ashley, who served on the task force formed by Gov. Rick Scott to examine the law after Trayon's death. The dictionary defines ""unequivocal"" as ""admitting of no doubt or misunderstanding; clear and unambiguous."" Ashley’s statement could leave listeners with the impression that Florida sheriffs’ have no doubts about the stand your ground law. Is that correct? Sheriffs association vote on ‘stand your ground’ The ""stand your ground"" law, which was approved overwhelmingly by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005, allows people to use deadly force when they believe their life is at risk. Trayvon, of Miami Gardens, was shot in Sanford on Feb. 26, 2012, by George Zimmerman, a white-Hispanic neighborhood watchman. The ""stand your ground"" law was cited in the jury instructions, and in July 2013, the jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder. The law became a touchstone in the debate about Trayvon's death. About a month after the acquittal, the Florida Sheriffs Association issued a press release expressing support for the law. ""The right to self-defense is well-established in law,"" stated the Aug. 9 press release. ""The Florida Sheriffs confirmed this position by voting unanimously, at the 2013 Florida Sheriffs Association Summer Conference, to support the 'stand your ground' law as it is currently written. Our current judicial system is comprised of multiple checks and balances to ensure fair and equitable application of all laws, including 'stand your ground.' "" Ashley, who participated in the vote, told PolitiFact Florida that none of the sheriffs voiced opposition to the law during the association’s meeting at Marco Island in August. ""As with any issue you can only measure support or opposition to a position when it is voiced at the time of its measurement,"" Ashley told PolitiFact Florida in an email. But some news reports about the association’s announcement questioned whether it was accurate to describe the vote as ""unanimous."" For starters, it was unclear how many sheriffs voted. The association reported that 57 of its 66 sheriffs registered for the conference, but the association didn’t record the number who participated in the vote -- some may have left before the vote or didn’t participate in it. ""It was a large number of sheriffs,"" Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, the association president, told PolitiFact Florida. ""I can’t tell you if it was 57, 52, 55. It is a well-attended session because that’s where we discuss things among ourselves that are of some importance."" News reports indicated that some sheriffs -- including from large urban counties including Broward, Hillsborough and Orange -- didn’t participate in the vote and that a few sheriffs had some reservations about the law. Judd told PolitiFact that there was no written agenda that notified sheriffs ahead of time that they would take a vote on the ""stand your ground"" law. Judd said that sheriffs had heard that House Speaker Will Weatherford wanted input from law enforcement about the law, and that that’s what prompted the vote. Judd couldn’t recall for certain if he was the sheriff who brought up the topic, but he added that it might have been him. (Judd was elevated to the group’s presidency during the conference.) There was no written motion about the vote, but Judd said the wording was essentially: ""Do you support Florida’s 'stand your ground' law?"" ""It was a unanimous vote and there was not a voice in opposition,"" Judd said. Judd said he was frustrated that news reports questioned his description of the vote as ""unanimous."" ""Some reporters say ‘you didn’t have 100 percent of Florida sheriffs.’ You are missing the issue. We had 100 percent vote of the ones in the room that voted. ... It’s kind of like election day -- you don’t show up and vote, your vote doesn’t count."" Judd said the association’s vote doesn’t stop any individual sheriffs from advocating for their personal views about the law. Sheriffs could weigh in again at their conference in February shortly before the legislative session. Some sheriffs have raised concerns about the law The vote is one thing; subsequent comments by sheriffs are another. We found news reports about seven sheriffs, a mix of Democrats and Republicans, who either raised concerns about the law or whose position about the law was unclear. In some cases, these sheriffs didn’t participate in the association’s vote. PolitiFact Florida contacted spokespersons for those sheriffs. Here’s a summary of our findings: Broward County: The Sun-Sentinel reported that Sheriff Scott Israel wasn’t at the Florida Sheriffs Association conference due to National Night Out events in Broward. Israel told the Sentinel in August that had he attended, ""I would have voted against the FSA statement on the 'stand your ground' law. I support an individual's right to use armed self-defense when faced with the immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury, and without requiring any duty to retreat in one's own home. However, if there is a safe opportunity in other settings to retreat and de-escalate potentially deadly violence, it should be done. For this reason, I support legislative changes to more narrowly restrict the use of the 'stand your ground' defense."" Israel expressed support for ""fixing serious flaws"" in the law in an October op-ed in the Sun-Sentinel. Pinellas County: Sheriff Bob Gualtieri told PolitiFact Florida in an email, ""I was unclear as to exactly what was being asked in the motion,"" at the association meeting. ""I did not verbalize a response when the voice vote was called."" Gualtieri said that he ""unequivocally"" supports the broad concept of the ""stand your ground"" law. However, he said there is room for discussion about some adjustments. ""I do not support the application of SYG immunity in circumstances where the person against whom deadly force was used was totally unarmed with any type of weapon when the force was used,"" Gualtieri said. ""I also do not believe that someone deemed to be a 'primary aggressor' should be able to assert SYG — one does not get to pick the fight and then end it with deadly force."" Hillsborough: The Tampa Tribune reported that Sheriff David Gee attended the conference but left before the vote. (We confirmed that directly with a spokeswoman.) He said he ""wouldn't have voted that way without hearing the state attorneys out on that issue.""   In July 2012, Gee sent a response to an NRA questionnaire in which he declined to provide his personal opinion about self defense. ""The Legislature has spoken on this issue,"" he wrote. ""HCSO deputies always follow the law."" Orange: A spokesman for Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told PolitiFact Florida that Demings attended the meeting but had to leave early to attend National Night Out events. The spokesman sent us a previous statement by Demings: ""Had I been present, I likely would not have supported the vote. As a member of the Citizen Safety and Protection Task Force appointed by Governor Scott last year, I stand by the recommendations of the Task Force."" Volusia and Flagler counties: The News Service of Florida reported that the sheriffs in Volusia and Flagler counties expressed reservations about the law. A spokesman for Volusia Sheriff Ben Johnson told PolitiFact Florida in an email that Johnson was in the room for the vote but did not participate in it. Johnson, a past president of the association, stands behind the association’s position on the law, but added that ""his personal position differs slightly from that of the association. The sheriff supports the right of citizens to employ deadly force with no duty to retreat in order to defend themselves while in their homes or vehicles. However, when out in the open and facing a threat, the sheriff believes citizens should attempt to retreat if possible before using lethal force. He has consistently stated this position and supports the law, but believes it would be improved with the addition of three words (retreat if possible) as it relates to locations other than homes or vehicles."" Meanwhile, Flagler County Sheriff Jim Manfre, according to the News Service of Florida, ""said the association's take doesn't exactly match his personal view. Manfre said he thinks the castle doctrine should remain on the books and the rest be repealed."" (Manfre had no additional comment for PolitiFact Florida, his spokesman said.) Miami-Dade: Miami-Dade is the most populous county in the state and home to Trayvon, but J.D. Patterson -- the county’s appointed police director, the equivalent of an elected sheriff -- does not appear to have commented publicly about ""stand your ground."" According to Huffington Post, a spokesperson for Patterson confirmed that he attended the conference but couldn’t say if he voted. ""Director J.D. Patterson was there and he does not wish to discuss the issue,"" Det. Alvaro Zabaleta told PolitiFact Florida in an email. Our ruling During a legislative hearing about Florida’s controversial ""stand your ground"" law, Okaloosa Sheriff Larry Ashley said ""Florida sheriffs unequivocally support this, the right to 'stand your ground.' "" The Florida Sheriffs Association did take a voice vote in August that the association reported was unanimous in support of the current ""stand your ground"" law. But no more than 57 of the state’s 66 sheriffs voted (and quite likely fewer) and a number of sheriffs, including those representing some of the state’s most populous counties, have spoken publicly or to PolitiFact Florida about their reservations about the law. Ashley’s comments left readers with the impression that the support among Florida is ""unequivocal,"" or unambiguous, but that’s not the case.

Sen. Ted Cruz says gun prosecutions down under Obama administration
","After leading the charge for a government shutdown to defund President Barack Obama’s health care law, freshman Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, hasn’t shied away from the spotlight. On Nov. 8, 2013, Cruz was a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Long before he got to the obligatory joke about reading Green Eggs & Ham during a lengthy Senate speech, he addressed gun policy. ""Do you target violent criminals, or do you try to take away the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens?"" Cruz said. After the senator criticized Obama for focusing on the latter at the expense of the former, he praised predecessor George W. Bush’s efforts. ""Under President Bush, prosecution of gun crimes was 30 percent higher than it is under President Obama,"" Cruz said. ""They’re not targeting bad guys."" We decided to see how the numbers differed under the two presidents. Ways to read the data Let’s break down the number of federal prosecutions by year. We’ll start with fiscal year 2002, since that represents Bush’s first full year in office. Fiscal year 2012 is the most recent year we have data for. There are two different sets of statistics we can look at. Cruz’s spokeswoman referred us to the Transitional Records Access Clearinghouse, a Syracuse University data-gathering organization. This data tracks federal gun prosecutions by the lead, or most serious, charge. On the other hand, the Department of Justice’s United States Attorney’s Office tracks all charges, a more inclusive category of prosecutions. Their data set includes everyone who was charged with a gun crime. The lead charge category only includes people whose most serious offense was gun-related, a distinction that omits thousands of charges each year. Cruz’s spokeswoman also told us that Cruz’s claim didn’t take into account numbers for Bush’s entire term: He used 2004, the high-water mark for lead gun prosecutions during the time period, as his starting point. We’re left with four ways to calculate the percent change: • Lead charges from 2002 to 2012, which gives us a 2.2 percent decrease • Lead charges from 2004 to 2012, which gives us a 29.4 percent decrease • All charges from 2002 to 2012, which gives us a 10.3 percent increase • All charges from 2005 (the high-water mark of this data set) to 2012, which gives us a 10.2 percent decrease This makes clear how Cruz got his 30 percent decrease. However, that’s not the only, or necessarily the best, approach. None other than TRAC’s co-director, Susan Long, told PolitiFact that her organization’s use of lead charges isn’t as comprehensive as using all charges. She also called Cruz’s 2004 start date misleading, since it amounts to cherry-picking. The most reliable number may be the 10.3 percent increase in gun prosecutions between fiscal years 2002 and 2012. This rate actually indicates the trend moving in the opposite direction from what Cruz asserted. Who’s responsible? In addition to highlighting a numerical difference in federal gun crime prosecutions, Cruz specifically suggested that Obama’s policies are responsible for the decrease. But how much influence does the president really have on the issue? Experts say: not much. ""The Bush administration was all over the map,"" Long said. ""Those trends really are being driven by something other than presidential policy,"" since the peaks and valleys don’t coincide with presidential terms, she said. As we’ve noted in a previous fact check, the president, as the head of the executive branch, can order changes to prosecutorial priorities. For instance, following the Newtown, Conn. school shooting in December 2012, Obama did call for the need to ""maximize enforcement efforts to prevent gun violence and prosecute gun crime."" We don’t yet have data that reflects prosecutions in the aftermath of Newtown. But it’s important to note that Obama’s priorities are not the only factors at play in these decisions. Any presidential shift in policy must filter down to the attorney general, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field offices, and front-line attorneys, said Ronald Frandsen, grants administrator for the Regional Justice Information Service. U.S. attorneys can decline to prosecute gun cases for a variety of reasons, as outlined by TRAC. So Obama is responsible for setting the broad policy approach to gun prosecutions, but he isn’t micromanaging individual cases. Much of the decision-making occurs at a lower level. Our ruling Cruz said prosecution of gun crimes under the Bush administration was 30 percent higher than it is under Obama. It’s possible to get a decline that big by cherry-picking the data, but the most inclusive method actually produces an increase. Cruz also overstates the role of the president in determining prosecution rates. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DD0240>],/factchecks/2013/nov/15/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-gun-prosecutions-down-under-obama/

Rep. Jim McDermott says a minimum wage job doesn't get you half way to poverty line
","A recent Gallup poll showed that an overwhelming 76 percent of Americans want the minimum wage increased to $9. There hasn’t been a minimum wage increase in four years, and the prospect of an increase -- particularly in the Republican-controlled House -- looks dim. But that hasn’t stopped advocates of a higher minimum wage from making their case. In a recent interview with the Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC, Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., said that at its current level, the minimum wage is inadequate for making an acceptable living. ""The minimum wage at the federal level has been frozen for four years at $7.75,"" he said on Nov. 12, 2013. ""In the state of Washington, we’ve raised it to $9.15 and people there took it in their own hands and said, let’s go to $15 because people have gotten fed up with Washington, D.C. They don’t expect a thing to come out of Congress. … On $7.75 you can’t even make half the poverty level. You’ve got to have two jobs. You have to work 80 hours a week."" We wondered: Is it true that if you are paid $7.75 an hour, ""you can't even make half the poverty level?"" First off, we need to correct one aspect of McDermott’s claim.While he’s right that the federal minimum wage has been static for the past four years, it’s $7.25 an hour, not $7.75. But because he was specific about the dollar amount, we’ll use that to make our calculations. If you earned $7.75 an hour for 40 hours a week and 52 weeks a year, you would earn $16,120. For this to be less than half the poverty level, the poverty level would have to be at least $32,240. Is the poverty level that high? For most households, no. The federal poverty level is actually a matrix of different dollar amounts. It depends on the size of the family, with larger families having a higher threshold. The poverty level only exceeds $32,240 for families with at least seven people -- say, two parents and five children, or one parent and six children. (For a seven-person household, an income of $35,610 is right at the poverty level.) If we were to use the actual minimum wage of $7.25, the yearly income would be less than half of poverty for a six-person family, rather than seven. It’s worth noting that seven-person households are a small fraction of all households. According to the Census Bureau, only 9 percent of households have even three children, and the number with five (or six, if it's a single-parent household) is even smaller. Extrapolating from 2006 data, we estimate that about 2 percent of households have at least five children. So, McDermott’s claim would be wrong for 98 percent of households. And this may even understate how wrong he is. Under the federal Earned Income Tax Credit -- which provides a refundable tax credit to working people with low incomes -- a poverty-level household with two adults and two children would be eligible for $5,372 in tax credits, noted Michael Wiseman, a professor of public policy and economics at George Washington University. That would make McDermott’s scenario even more far-fetched. A spokeswoman for McDermott acknowledged that he ""misspoke,"" both about the amount of the federal minimum wage and about how far that wage would go. ""The point he was trying to make was that the current minimum wage is nowhere close to a livable wage,"" said spokeswoman Amber Macdonald.  Our ruling McDermott said that ""on (the federal minimum wage of) $7.75, you can’t even make half the poverty level."" He’s wrong about what the federal minimum wage is -- it’s $7.25. And for about 98 percent of households, he’s wrong that a year of working at that wage rate wouldn’t even get you to half of the poverty level. We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DE7740>],/factchecks/2013/nov/15/jim-mcdermott/rep-jim-mcdermott-says-minimum-wage-job-doesnt-get/
"['Health Care', 'PunditFact', 'Ellen Qualls']","
Is the ACA the GOP health care plan from 1993?
","If there’s one thing conservatives might hate more than Obamacare, it’s hearing that Obamacare springs from Republican ideas. The Heritage Foundation, the granddaddy of the right-wing think tanks, fumed when President Barack Obama said it was the source of the concept of the health insurance marketplaces where people could shop for the best deal. (We rated Obama's claim Mostly True.) Squaring off with Sean Hannity on his Fox News Channel show, Democratic public relations consultant Ellen Qualls could barely get these words out: Qualls: History lesson. This was the Republican plan ... Hannity: This was not the Republican plan. Qualls: … in the early '90s. Hannity: No Republican supported it. Not one Republican voted for this. Qualls: Yes, in the '90s ... Hannity: That’s a lie. Qualls: … during the Clinton administration, this was the ‘Let’s fix the private insurance system ... Hannity: No. No. Qualls:  … and make it work’, instead of making it a government system. Time out! Is the Affordable Care Act really the same as ""the Republican plan in the early '90s?"" Short answer -- sort of. There was a Republican bill in the Senate that looked a whole lot like Obamacare, but it wasn’t the only GOP bill on Capitol Hill, it never came to a vote and from what we can tell, plenty of conservative Republicans didn’t like it. Qualls told PunditFact that she was thinking of the Senate bill. 1993: Health care takes center stage President Bill Clinton took on an ill-fated effort to reform health care in 1993. As the president’s task force (led by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton) worked behind closed doors to craft solutions to ever-rising health care costs and a growing number of uninsured families, Republicans scrambled to forge an alternative. Republican Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island was the point man. The bill he introduced, Health Equity and Access Reform Today, (yes, that spells HEART) had a list of 20 co-sponsors that was a who’s who of Republican leadership. There was Minority Leader Bob Dole, R- Kan., Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, Richard Lugar, R-Ind., and many others. There also were two Democratic co-sponsors. Among other features, the Chafee bill included: An individual mandate; Creation of purchasing pools; Standardized benefits; Vouchers for the poor to buy insurance; A ban on denying coverage based on a pre-existing condition. ""You would find a great deal of similarity to provisions in the Affordable Care Act,"" Sheila Burke, Dole’s chief of staff in 1993, told PunditFact via email. ""The guys were way ahead of the times!! Different crowd, different time, suffice it to say."" That said, the Senate plan from 1993 was not identical to the health care law that passed in 2010. The Republican bill did not expand Medicaid as Obamacare does, and it did have medical malpractice tort reform, which the current law does not. In contrast to the current employer mandate, the Chafee bill required employers to offer insurance, but they were under no obligation to help pay for it. Policy differences aside, health care scholar and former Clinton adviser Paul Starr at Princeton University said the Affordable Care Act is distinct in one other important way. ""The Chafee plan did not spell out how increased coverage would be financed,"" Starr said. ""It was more of a symbolic bill than an actual piece of legislation."" In fact, after the bill was introduced, the Senate never took it up again. Conservative pushback Even before Chafee brought his bill forward, some conservatives were trying to scuttle it. More hard-line senators such as Phil Gramm, R-Texas, House Republicans and the Heritage Foundation saw the Chafee bill as an unacceptable compromise. What they wanted was outright defeat of the president’s approach. No single alternative emerged, but there were a variety of Republican proposals. One in the House drew more co-sponsors than any other, 72 of them. It was called the Action Now Health Reform Act, but its scope was limited. Much of it focused on insurance for small businesses and the self-employed. It offered some protections for people with pre-existing conditions and included changes in medical malpractice law. There was a smorgasbord of other House Republican bills. Like Chafee’s bill, none of them went anywhere. Our ruling Qualls said the Affordable Care Act ""was the Republican plan in the '90s."" The bill she had in mind did have a strong roster of Republicans behind it, and it did share many major features with the Affordable Care Act. There were some significant differences but in a side-by-side comparison, the similarities dominate. However, to call it the Republican plan, as though a majority of Republicans endorsed it, goes too far. The House Republicans took a different path, and there was opposition from more hard-line members of the Republican coalition. It is telling that the Chafee bill never became a full blown bill and never came up for a vote.

"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says he turned $3.6 billion deficit into a $500 million surplus
","Barely weeks old, the 2014 governor’s race already is producing a downpour of conflicting claims about Gov. Scott Walker’s budgeting record. He turned a big deficit into a surplus! No, he turned a surplus into a big deficit! Walker makes the first claim early and often in his new book, ""Unintimidated,"" at one point writing that ""the $3.6 billion deficit we inherited has turned into more than a half-billion-dollar surplus."" Meanwhile, Democrat Mary Burke, Walker’s lone challenger so far, tells reporters: ""You've seen where we're now going from a $700 million surplus to getting into the next biennium with almost a $750 million deficit."" Is one or both correct? Are they both all wet? Today, we’ll just look at the claim by Walker. We’ll examine Burke’s another day, but here’s a partial spoiler alert: Burke and Walker are talking about budgets from different years. The governor’s $3.6 billion number is one of his favorites. We fact checked it in February 2011, when Walker pointed to the big budget hole as he prepared to unveil a budget covering mid-2011 to mid-2013. We rated False a claim by Democratic state Rep. Mark Pocan, who is now a member of Congress, that Walker’s $3.6 billion estimate was ""a bogus figure."" Outside experts agreed that Walker’s number was reasonable. What about the second figure cited by Walker -- the ""more than a half-billion-dollar surplus""? A footnote in ""Unintimidated"" indicates Walker relied on a media account of a January 2013 report by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which predicted that Walker’s first budget would end with a $484 million surplus. The surplus number actually grew after Walker submitted his book (it’s due out Nov. 19, but we obtained an advance copy). An October 2013 memo from the same source documented an official surplus of $759 million in the state’s main account at the end of Walker’s first two-year budget (June 30, 2013). This memo was not available when Walker submitted the book, a spokeswoman for the publisher, Penguin Group, told us. So, Walker’s numbers are on target or close, based on what he knew when he wrote that passage. But there’s a problem lining them up next to each other and suggesting a positive swing of more than $4.1 billion. Fruit salad The two figures measure different things. It’s a classic case of apples and oranges. The $3.6 billion ""deficit"" is actually not a deficit at all in a concrete accounting sense. It’s a pre-budget estimate designed to illustrate the size of the shortfall or challenge the governor faces when putting together a budget. ""Actually, it's more like apples, oranges and coffee beans,"" Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance president Todd Berry said. ""The term 'deficit' has been used to describe multiple fiscal conditions, past, present, and future, that are actually quite different from one another. Both sides of the aisle know this and will interchangeably use these various definitions to spin things any way they want."" The pre-budget ""shortfall"" is a soft number, Berry noted, in that it includes state agency spending wish lists, many of which are destined for the circular file. In any event, here’s bottom line #1: That $3.6 billion shortfall that preceded Walker’s first budget is best compared to the projected shortfall Walker faced in his second budget. That number was actually a positive one -- $177 million, according to Walker administration reports. That underscores Walker’s success at reducing budgeting tricks in the first budget. So, the swing isn’t more than $4.1 billion, it’s more like $3.77 billion. The apples-to-apples view still favors Walker, just not quite as much as he portrayed. Our rating Walker says in his book that ""the $3.6 billion deficit we inherited has turned into more than a half-billion-dollar surplus."" There’s some truth here, in that Walker cites accurate or close-to-accurate numbers that show a turnaround from red to black in two years.

"['Georgia', 'Lynn Westmoreland']","
Westmoreland says he's no big spender
","U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, who prides himself on being a fiscal conservative, made an interesting claim about his frugality in one recent article. The Coweta County Republican said his office ""runs on as little money as possible to properly serve my constituents, and for that reason I have returned money every year since taking office."" The Citizen newspaper reported the comments. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Westmoreland, who’s been in Congress since 2005, is correct about his penny-pinching ways. Westmoreland was responding to questions about staff spending during that October partial government shutdown we’d all like to forget. Westmoreland’s spokeswoman, Leslie Shedd, said the congressman’s claim was correct and sent us an annual breakdown of how much money he has returned to the federal government. Congressional spending has attracted more scrutiny since the shutdown. Two Georgia congressmen, Hank Johnson, D-Lithonia, and Tom Price, R-Roswell, are spending $5,000 or more a month on office space, well more than their colleagues, according to a recent WXIA-TV investigation. Each year, each member of Congress gets between $1 million and $1.9 million from the federal budget to pay their staff and for office space, travel and other expenses. The allocations are called Member’s Representational Allowance, or MRA. The House of Representatives decreased the MRA budget by 5 percent in 2011 and by slightly more than 6 percent in 2012. Westmoreland has received an annual average of nearly $1.4 million. The overwhelming majority of Westmoreland’s spending was on his staff. Here’s Westmoreland’s breakdown of the money he said he’s returned: Year        Amount 2005        $53,034 2006        $15,969 2007        $52,570 2008        $41,818 2009        $179,462 2010        $150,005 2011        $143,970 2012        $120,077 The total, Shedd noted, is $756,905. ""As a note, as of right now, we plan to return money once again in 2013 -- even though we are dealing with sequester and budget cuts,"" the spokeswoman said. The House of Representatives keeps track of MRA spending in quarterly reports on its website dating to 2009. Prior spending is recorded in small, thick books kept in some local libraries. PolitiFact Georgia examined Westmoreland’s spending online and looked at some of those books at Emory University’s Woodruff Library. In each year, we found Westmoreland’s expenses were less than his MRA budget. Our calculation showed Westmoreland spent less than his office told us. Experts told us that some office spending in December may not have been included by the end of the year, thus, the difference. The quarterly reports do not include a detailed breakdown of when each expenditure was made. So what happens with the unspent money? ""Any unexpended MRA appropriated balance remaining at the end of the fiscal year is available for two additional fiscal years before being returned to the U.S. Treasury as part of returned FY appropriations,"" according to the House website. We took a look at the other members of Congress from Georgia and each one of them had spent less money in 2012 than was budgeted. Westmoreland spent less than most of his Georgia colleagues in 2012. To sum up, Westmoreland said he has returned money from his allotted budget each year he’s been in office. The numbers he sent -- and that we independently reviewed -- show he makes a good point. Our rating: True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4A3440>],/factchecks/2013/nov/15/lynn-westmoreland/westmoreland-says-hes-no-big-spender/

MSNBC contributor Goldie Taylor says national debt is at its lowest point since World War II
","MSNBC contributor Goldie Taylor joined the Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC’s PoliticsNation on Tuesday to criticize former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for comparing the national debt to slavery. Sharpton said Palin’s comments were not only offensive but wrong on the facts, as the national debt ""has been reduced every year for the last five years under this president."" Taylor responded, ""You know, our national debt is as low as it has been since World War II. And so the notion that our national debt is growing at some astronomical rate really is a misnomer."" We thought their claims were ripe for a PunditFact review. We rated Sharpton’s comment False, and for a pretty basic reason. Sharpton mixed up the deficit with the debt. The budget words sort of sound alike, but they’re not interchangeable. The deficit is a yearly measure of revenues against spending, and the debt is the sum of all past deficits minus any annual surpluses. Taylor made a similar mix-up as she misconstrued a larger talking point we’ve heard from the Obama administration this year. The deal with debt Taylor’s statement is off no matter how you slice it. * In raw dollars: Gross federal debt is at an historic high of $17.1 trillion, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. When President Barack Obama took office in 2009, it was $10.6 trillion. (The debt grew by $4.9 trillion under President George W. Bush. Under Obama, it is poised to double.) * As a percentage of the national economy, commonly measured as the Gross Domestic Product: The debt as a percentage of GDP reached 103 percent in 2012 after a steady climb since 2009, according to tables from the White House Office of Management and Budget. The debt as a percentage of GDP had not been that high since 1947, when it was 110.3 percent. The story is the same for the 2012 federal deficit, which fell to 7 percent of GDP but was larger than any year since the end of World War II. In fact, as University of California Berkeley law professor Alan Auerbach pointed out, the federal government had budget surpluses while Bill Clinton was president. ""Whether you look at the debt or the deficit, it is clearly false that the figures are smaller than anything since WWII,"" said Princeton University economist Harvey Rosen. ‘What I should have said’ On Twitter, Taylor told us she should have said, ""The deficit is falling at its fastest rate since WWII."" That statement, borrowed from Obama team talking points, would have been more accurate. PolitiFact previously reviewed Obama’s claim that ""our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years"" and rated it True. The deficit was 10.1 percent of GDP in 2009, but fell in 2012 to 7 percent -- a decline of 3.1 percentage points. The period between 1946 and 1949, when the deficit as a percentage of GDP fell 7.4 percentage points, produced the only bigger decline. Experts have criticized Obama’s point as misleading. The recent drop is happening because the deficit was so large to begin with that it had more room to fall. The government ran the largest budget deficits relative to the GDP during 2009 and 2012 than since 1946, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and this is causing the debt ""to soar."" The debt’s long-term growth ""is very worrisome given the risks it poses and the time needed to reverse the upward trajectory of debt,"" said Jason Peuquet, research fellow at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. And for all of the crowing about the reduced deficit, CBO expects it to increase again in the next decade due to spending on programs for our aging population, health costs, new subsidies to offset the cost of health insurance, and larger interest payments on the debt. Our ruling Taylor said, ""Our national debt is as low as it has been since World War II,"" which is plainly incorrect. The debt is as high as it’s ever been, in terms of real dollars, and it ticks up by the second.  Taylor acknowledged her flub, tweeting us that she will work on ""slowing things down a bit to make sure I get it right."" Her statement on PoliticsNation rates False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096799880>],/factchecks/2013/nov/14/goldie-taylor/msnbc-contributor-goldie-taylor-says-national-debt/

New Jersey Medicaid expansion was small, given already large program, Christie says
","In a victory lap following his landslide re-election Nov. 5, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, hit four of the five major Sunday morning talk shows. On ABC’s This Week, host George Stephanopoulos talked about 2016 Republican primary prospects with Christie. Stephanopoulos flagged Medicaid as a potential source of criticism from Christie’s own party. ""You didn't set up an exchange, but you did accept the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare,"" Stephanopoulos said. ""And some of your potential rivals like Ted Cruz are going to come after you on that. What's your answer?"" Christie’s response was in line with his standard ""Jersey-first"" approach to discussions of national politics. ""I do what's best for the people in the state of New Jersey every day,"" he said. ""And expanding Medicaid in the state of New Jersey, given how expansive our program already was, it was a relatively small expansion. But it's going to mean a lot. And it's also going to benefit New Jersey's budget."" We wondered if Christie was right in saying that New Jersey only needed a minor Medicaid expansion to comply with Obamacare. (Christie’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this story, but we did hear from the New Jersey Department of Human Services.) What the law says First, some background on the law. The Affordable Care Act expands the pool of individuals who could be eligible to receive Medicaid, a health insurance program for low-income U.S. residents. Previously, most of the people who were eligible were pregnant women, parents and children in low-income households. The law expands coverage to people 65 and under who have income up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. This year, the poverty level is $11,490 for an individual. Each state can individually decide whether or not to participate in this expansion, which the federal government will fully fund for the first three years. How does New Jersey stack up? To evaluate Christie’s claim, we sized up New Jersey’s Medicaid program against those of other states. Leighton Ku, a Medicaid expert and professor at George Washington University, said it’s not enough to look at a list of how much money each state appropriates for Medicaid funding, because most of the money states appropriate go toward plans for the elderly and disabled -- groups for which Obamacare isn’t expanding Medicaid. New Jersey now covers parents with incomes up to 200 percent of the poverty level and childless adults at up to 23 percent of the poverty level, according to table 3 of the Kaiser Family Foundation report. Under Obamacare in 2014, that would expand to cover childless adults up to 138 percent of the poverty level. New Jersey’s current Medicaid coverage puts it among the most generous states for Medicaid. For coverage of parents, Minnesota comes in first nationally at 215 percent of poverty, with New Jersey and two other states just behind. For childless adults, only 17 states offer any eligibility at all, so New Jersey’s 23 percent isn’t as restrictive, relatively speaking, as it might seem. A 2011 Rutgers University study estimates that 100,000 more New Jersey residents will be eligible for Medicaid in 2014, which currently covers about 1.3 million people. That’s about a 7.7 percent increase in people eligible. How does that compare to other states? We don’t yet have access to uniform, comprehensive, state-by-state data for the number of people who could benefit from Medicaid eligibility expansions, said Chris Lee, a Kaiser Family Foundation spokesman. In all, 24 states (plus the District of Columbia) chose to expand Medicaid. However, we could only locate data for nine other states. For these nine states, we divided the potential increase by the number of people already enrolled in Medicaid. This is an imperfect calculation, because the most recent numbers Kaiser provides are from fiscal year 2010. But it gives a rough sense of the scale. Of the nine states, only Minnesota had a lower projected eligibility increase than New Jersey (3.7 percent). The other eight had a higher percentage. And, of course, many states aren’t expanding eligibility at all. Our ruling Christie touted New Jersey’s ""expansive"" Medicaid program. Because New Jersey was already generous in its Medicaid eligibility guidelines compared to other states, the potential increase in Medicaid enrollments due to Obamacare is relatively small. Only one out of the other nine states for which we found data had a lower percentage increase in the Medicaid-eligible population due to Obamacare. So Christie’s comment appears accurate, though the uncertainty due to the missing data leads us to rate it Mostly True. Correction, Nov. 18, 2013: This report was corrected to note that New Jersey's current Medicaid coverage is 23 percent, and that would expand under Obamacare in 2014 to up to 138 percent of the poverty level.  The rating is unchanged. Also, this item was updated shortly after publication to make clear that the New Jersey Department of Human Services did respond to our inquiry.

UPDATED: During flood, Austin's Onion Creek flowed up to 34 percent faster than Niagara Falls on average
","On a recent day of fatal flash floods, a Southeast Austin creek ran so quickly, it outpaced Niagara Falls in a way, the City of Austin said. A Nov. 6, 2013, city press release said that according to the U.S. Geological Survey, water ""levels at Onion Creek at U.S. 183 reached its record height of 41 feet during the Oct. 31,"" 2013 ""storm, when the U.S. 183 water gauge rose 11 feet in 15 minutes between 6:15 a.m. and 6:30 a.m."" Also, the release said, available ""records show that water levels never before exceeded 40 feet at this location and only exceeded 35 feet during three other years: 2001, 1921 and 1869."" Flooding in Southeast Austin damaged or destroyed about 660 structures and at least five lives were lost, three of them in the Onion Creek area, the Austin American-Statesman later reported. The city’s press release continued: ""The Onion Creek’s highest flow rate during Oct. 31 was 120,000 cubic feet per second, which is nearly double the average flow rate of Niagara Falls."" Flow rate is the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per unit of time, the release said. Do both ends of this flow-rate claim hold water? By telephone and email, officials later told us they based the reference to the Onion Creek flow rate on USGS information on the creek’s flow at U.S. 183 on Austin’s southeastern edge. They said the cited average flow rate of Niagara Falls, the international tourist site in New York state and Canada, came from Wikipedia, the collaboratively edited, multilingual free Internet encyclopedia. By email, city spokeswoman Wendy Morgan sent what she described as a Nov. 4, 2013, printout of the service’s Onion Creek flow measurements showing even higher flow rates. The USGS figures indicate that the creek’s Oct. 31 flow rate was 126,000 cubic feet per second at 8:43 a.m and 134,000 cubic feet per second at 9:45 a.m. The printout shows no flow readings at 10 a.m. and 10:07 a.m. with the flow rate being 130,000 cubic feet per second at 10:20 a.m. and decreasing, mostly, over the next 80 minutes. Morgan said the press release relied on older ""provisional"" USGS flow-rate figures. And what of Niagara Falls? Paul Yura, a National Weather Service meteorologist based in New Braunfels, noted by phone that the Wikipedia entry for Niagara Falls includes a statistical box (absent a listed source) stating Niagara Falls has an average flow rate of 64,750 cubic feet per second. Yura said he and other officials responding to the situation and trying to convey the significance of the creek’s rise ""were trying to find some quick numbers"" to show the flow’s surge. Morgan said separately: ""We were trying to find an analogy that conveyed the force of the water flow."" Toward lining up an authoritative indication of the average flow of Niagara Falls, we reached an Albany-based USGS hydrologist, Gary Firda, who pointed out by phone that the falls are on the Niagara River, which connects Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. According to a Sept. 21, 2012, USGS report, the river’s average 2011 flow rate at the head of the river at Buffalo, about 17 miles above the falls, was 201,400 cubic feet per second while the average flow rate from 1926 through 2011 was 204,400 cubic feet per second. And has the average flow of the falls themselves been considerably less? Firda said he didn’t know, suggesting that we reach out to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the federal body with some jurisdiction over the river on the border with Canada. A Corps web page states that the flow of the 36-mile-long Niagara River changes based on factors including narrowing and widening along the way, diversions into channels and canals and islands in its path. Significantly too, the U.S. and Canada divert water for power generation. ""The first production of electrical power dates from 1877. Since then, there has been a continuous growth, which is now limited only by the control imposed by the Niagara Treaty of 1950,"" the web page says. ""This treaty, between the governments of Canada and the United States, requires a minimum flow over the falls of 100,000 (cubic feet per second)"" from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. April through mid-September every year and from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. from mid-September through October each year.  ""A minimum flow of 50,000 cfs is required at all other times (non-tourist hours),"" the district says. Mandated minimum flows aren’t the same as an average flow, we heard from Corps officials including George Cotroneo, who heads the Lower Great Lakes Hydraulics and Hydrology Branch in the agency’s Buffalo district. By phone, Cotroneo said the government doesn’t track the average flow rate over the falls. But generally, he said, that rate varies based on the time of day and year and factors including how much water is diverted upstream to generate electricity. All that aside, Cotroneo said he estimates the average flow rate over the falls at 100,000 cubic feet per second, or about half the average flow of the river upstream at Buffalo. ""It’s not necessarily 100,000 cubic feet per second going over the falls during tourist season,"" Cotroneo said, though he said he considers that the average because it’s the minimum flow rate when tourists make their visits. ""It could be more, depending on diversions to"" power plants. He said, too, that heavy winds can cause the falls to plunge even faster. We asked Cotroneo if he was familiar with the average flow-rate figure posted on the Wikipedia page. He said he wasn’t before speculating that the figure was calculated based on the time periods and minimum flow rates stipulated by the 1950 treaty. ""I wouldn’t do that,"" he said. We later reached a Chicago-based official with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, John W. Kangas, who doubles as U.S. secretary for the International Niagara Committee, a body created under the 1950 treaty to determine the amount of water available for the falls and power generation. Kangas said by email that he devised an equation based on the flow requirements in the treaty that supports an average minimum flow rate at the falls of 66,600 cubic feet per second. Kangas agreed that the flow rate is 100,000 cubic feet per second when summer tourists flock there. Our ruling The city said Onion Creek’s highest flow rate of 120,000 cubic feet per second during a recent flood nearly doubled the average flow of Niagara Falls. We didn’t find a time-stamped, ribbon-wrapped figure for the average flow rate of Niagara Falls. But the city’s declared ""highest"" flow rate of the creek was 20 percent greater--not nearly double--the average flow rate of the falls as estimated by a federal expert who based his assessment on the flow rate in tourist season. The creek’s actual highest flow rate that day, of 134,000 cubic feet per second, was 34 percent greater. This claim has an element of truth; the creek briefly ran faster than Niagara Falls on average. But the press release understated the creek’s highest flow and also gave an unsourced figure for the average flow of the falls. We rate the statement as Mostly False. CLARIFICATION, 1:30 p.m., Nov. 18, 2013: We amended this article to clarify that an official's estimate of the flow rate of Niagara Falls was based on the flow when tourists are typically there. We also added information collected after we published this article indicating that there is an equation supporting the idea that the falls' minimum average flow rate is about 66,000 cubic feet per second. Our rating did not change. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Elections', 'Florida', 'Ken Detzner']","
One of the 'main functions' of the Department of Homeland Security’s SAVE database is 'checking voter registration citizenship status,' Ken Detzner says
","Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner has been on a public relations mission to defend his plan to use federal Homeland Security data to search for noncitizens on the voting rolls. The key to the revamped process is using a federal resource of data, called the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE. Detzner defended the use of SAVE for voter registration purposes during a Nov. 4 hearing before the Senate committee on ethics and elections. He said using SAVE to check voter registration is one of its primary uses. ""In fact, Homeland Security’s ‘benefit categories’ lists checking voter registration citizenship status as one of its main functions. The federal government allows SAVE to be used and check legal status as part of an ensuring the eligibility of registered voters."" Detzner said SAVE is used nationwide to verify citizenship for entitlement programs (such as Medicaid), so he argued that the state should be confident that it will provide credible information for elections officials. ""SAVE has really been a game-changer when it comes to (voter) list maintenance,"" he said. We wanted to check this part of Detzner’s claim: Does Homeland Security list checking voter registration citizenship status as one of its main functions? Is voter registration one of the main purposes of SAVE? A document from the Department of Homeland Security lists reasons that government agencies routinely use SAVE to check citizenship status, and the list includes voter registration purposes. Implemented in 1987, SAVE was originally intended to verify eligibility for government benefits, programs and licensing, including Medicaid or welfare, driver’s licenses, government education loans, unemployment compensation, housing assistance or tax exemptions. Over the years, the uses have expanded. SAVE is intended to show if someone is not a citizen, but it does not contain a database of people who are U.S. citizens. That’s why some voting rights groups have argued that SAVE is not a foolproof method to clean up the voter rolls. We wondered what the data said on how often SAVE was used to check voter registration. SAVE includes a query code number for each type of benefit, and agencies are also assigned individual codes. For fiscal year 2013, SAVE had 13,220,774 queries nationwide. The most common query was for driver’s licenses -- that represented about one-third of the queries, or about 4.5 million. Another big category was queries relating to Social Security; those added up to more than 3.5 million. DHS compiled the number of nationwide queries for voter registration and found 13,100 -- so less than 1 percent of the 13 million queries. (In fiscal year 2013 in Florida, there were about one million SAVE queries by Florida agencies, and the majority were for driver’s licenses and health and social services.) We sent Detzner’s spokeswoman a summary of our nationwide findings and asked for any documentation to support that one of the main functions of SAVE is to check voter registration. ""The secretary’s comment was about the primary functions of SAVE,"" said Brittany Lesser in an email. ""The document you reference and the DHS quote both verify SAVE’s purposes, which includes checking voter registration. Most of the current uses of SAVE pertain to benefits or licenses. One category pertains to ""badging agencies"" that need to determine eligibility to access certain facilities. The list also includes ""agencies that check citizenship status for voter registration."" Voter registration was listed second to last on the list, but DHS spokesman Steven Blando told PolitiFact Florida that the order of uses has no significance. We asked Blando does DHS consider voter registration to be a ""main function"" of SAVE? ""The SAVE database was not designed for this purpose and does not contain information about citizens born in the United States,"" Blando said. ""It is not a main function by volume or number of agencies."" Not all states use SAVE to check voter information. In 2005, Maricopa County, Ariz., was the first agency to enter into an agreement with the SAVE Program for voter registration, and a few other counties in Arizona were added later, according to DHS spokesman Christopher Bentley. By 2013, Florida, Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina had reached similar agreements. States with pending applications to use SAVE for voter lists include Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon, Tennessee and Virginia. Our ruling  Detzner told state legislators that one of the ""main functions"" of the Department of Homeland Security’s SAVE database is ""checking voter registration citizenship status."" A federal document lists voter registration as one of the benefits that SAVE data can be used for to check citizenship status. However, we found no documentation to support Detzner’s claim that voter registration is one of its ""main functions."" SAVE is primarily used for agencies to check citizenship status for public benefits or driver’s licenses. Using SAVE to check voter registration eligibility is a more recent use, and only in effect in four states, plus a few Arizona counties. For fiscal year 2013, voter registration queries equaled less than 1 percent of the searches. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F91BC0>],/factchecks/2013/nov/14/ken-detzner/main-functions-save-database-department-homeland-s/
"['Debt', 'PunditFact', 'Al Sharpton']","
Al Sharpton criticizes Sarah Palin for comparing slavery and national debt
","The Rev. Al Sharpton used his MSNBC show PoliticsNation Tuesday to criticize former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for recently likening the national debt to slavery. But in doing so, Sharpton and pundit Goldie Taylor made a common mistake -- confusing the national debt with the deficit. Here’s what Sharpton said: ""I mean, first of all, slavery in the American context was based on race. So you can’t talk about slavery in American context without talking about race,"" said Sharpton, reacting to Palin’s defense that her comparison is not racist. ""But second of all … the debt … by the way has been reduced every year for the last five years under this president."" Taylor then chimed in, ""You know, our national debt is as low as it has been since World War II. And so the notion that our national debt is growing at some astronomical rate really is a misnomer."" In this case, Sharpton’s specific claim is wrong. The debt has risen each year in terms of dollar amount and as a share of the economy since 2007. And it will continue to increase this year, said Jason Peuquet, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget research fellow. On Jan. 20, 2009, when Obama took office, the country’s total outstanding debt was $10.6 trillion. It stood at $17.1 trillion as of Nov. 8, 2013, according to the Treasury Department’s ""Debt to the Penny"" calculator. What Sharpton likely meant to say is that the deficit ""has been reduced every year for the last five years."" The deficit is the difference between what a government collects in revenues and spends in any one year. The debt is the accumulation of annual deficits minus any annual surpluses. We’re not letting Sharpton off the hook for his words, especially because he should know the difference, but if he had said deficit he’d be closer to the truth. The country started running a deficit instead of a surplus in 2002, at $159 billion. The recent run of deficits peaked in 2009 at $1.4 trillion, Obama’s first year in office. Since then, it’s come down, and there are a couple of ways to count that. One way is in sheer dollars, through historical tables from the White House Office of Management and Budget and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office: 2008: $458.6 billion deficit 2009: $1.413 trillion deficit 2010: $1.294 trillion deficit 2011: $1.299 trillion deficit 2012: $1.087 trillion deficit 2013*: $642 billion deficit * estimated In this view, the deficit fell in 2010, 2012 and 2013, but increases in 2011. By another measure -- the deficit as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product -- the deficit did fall four consecutive years. Not five, as Sharpton tried to indicate. Unlike in the current-dollar method, the deficit as a measure of GDP between 2010 and 2011 because GDP grew faster in that year, said Alan Auerbach, a University of California economics and law professor. The deficit as a percentage of GDP shot up from 3 percent in 2008 to 10.1 percent in 2009. We turn again to data from White House Office of Management and Budget to look at the trend. 2008: 3.2 percent deficit 2009: 10.1 percent deficit 2010: 9 percent deficit 2011: 8.7 percent deficit 2012: 7 percent deficit 2013*: 6 percent deficit *estimated Projections from the Congressional Budget Office show slightly different percentages, but the trend remains the same for those years. CBO, however, estimates the deficit will fall through 2015 but tick up again in 2016 and beyond. ""So, the deficit fell between 2009 and 2012,"" said Harvey Rosen, Princeton University economics professor, by email. ""However, both figures are much bigger than anything since the early 70s (and I suspect since the late 1940s.)"" Our ruling Sharpton said that the national debt ""has been reduced every year for the last five years."" Sharpton confused the downward trend in annual deficits with the debt, which is what he said on air and what Palin controversially likened to slavery.

""During my eight years as county executive, we cut the number of county workers by 20 percent, and turned a $3.5 million county deficit into a surplus,"" he wrote.

Did his county administration downsize the county’s staffing ranks by 20% in eight years? The number checks out, we found. Annual county budget books document the number of full-time equivalent employees in Milwaukee County’s operating departments. The count dropped in every budget approved in Walker’s era, which covered nine budgets from 2003 to 2011. The year before he took office after a 2002 special election, the workforce stood at 7,047. His first year it was 6,703, and when he left it was 5,336. That’s a drop of 1,367, or 20.4%, by our math. Every category of county operations saw a decrease. County parks, general administration, transportation and public works saw the deepest losses of staff on the county payroll, county records show. Private contractors were hired, in some cases, to do the work of county employees. Two final notes. Downsizing is nothing new at the county. The county workforce fell 22 percent in the nine budgets prior to Walker’s arrival, slightly outstripping his trimming efforts. The biggest factor was the 1995 sale of the county-owned Doyne Hospital. During Walker’s last term, the state of Wisconsin stripped Milwaukee County of its role in administering food aid, child care and medical assistance programs, citing county mismanagement. Walker had proposed something similar, saying the state could do it less expensively. That reduced the county workforce by more than 300. But because the workers didn’t become state employees until 2011, the reduction does not affect the employee tally during Walker’s county time, which ended in December 2010.

Edinburg candidate is at least the second Latina to run for governor of Texas
","Edinburg journalist and activist Miriam Martinez said on her campaign website that she’s ""the first Latina to run for governor of Texas."" ¿De veras? Martinez, who recently filed her candidacy for the 2014 Republican gubernatorial nomination, told us by telephone that she based her self-description, which we saw on Nov. 11, 2013, on research into other Texas women to run for governor. She said Democrats Ann Richards, who won in 1990 and lost in 1994, and Miriam ""Ma"" Ferguson, who ran five times from 1924 through 1940, were not Latinas. Martinez further noted that Republican Debra Medina, who like then-Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison challenged Gov. Rick Perry in the 2010 primary, married into her Latina surname after growing up near Beeville as Debra Parker, as the Austin American-Statesman reported in a Feb. 12, 2010, news story. Toward gauging Martinez’s ""first,"" we tallied all the women to run for governor from 1845 through 2010. Our sources were the 2004-05 Texas Almanac plus historical election results posted online by the Texas Secretary of State’s office. Our sift--which got us to 15 women--yielded one pre-Martinez candidate clearly identified as Latina. (Skip ahead if you must.) After Ferguson made her bids, suffragist leader Minnie Fisher Cunningham sought the 1944 Democratic gubernatorial nomination, drawing 48,039 votes and placing second to Coke Stevenson in the nine-candidate field. Frances Farenthold ranks among the best-known woman to run for governor. Farenthold, who was a legislator, reached a runoff for the Democratic nomination in 1972 and also ran in the 1974 primary, losing both times to Dolph Briscoe. Other hopefuls fared less well. Benita Louise Marek Lawrence of Brenham ran in the 1950 Democratic primary and Johnnie Mae Hackworthe, also of Brenham, who reportedly once unsuccessfully offered three Jersey cows in lieu of the $1,000 candidate filing fee, was in the 1968 Democratic primary ultimately led by Preston Smith. In 1972, the Socialist candidate for governor was Deborah Leonard; the same party ran Sherry Smith for governor in 1974 and Sara Jean Johnston in 1978. Sheila Bilyeu ran in the 1986 Democratic gubernatorial primary, finishing second to last in the six-person field. The 1986 Libertarian nominee for governor was Theresa Doyle. When Richards led the Democratic field in 1990, other contenders included Theresa Hearn-Haynes. And what of Latinas? San Antonio physician Alma Ludivina Aguado garnered 19,273 votes in the seven-person 2010 Democratic gubernatorial primary carried by Houston Mayor Bill White. In a Jan. 4, 2010, press release, Aguado referred to herself as potentially the first Hispanic woman physician to serve as governor. The release said Aguada was born in Eagle Pass on the Texas-Mexico border. Footnote: Several Latinos have run for governor. Henry B. Gonzalez of San Antonio sought the Democratic nod in 1958 before he went on to win repeated U.S. House terms. Laredo businessman Tony Sanchez became the Democratic nominee for governor in 2002 after besting then-Attorney General Dan Morales and others in the primary. Also, La Raza Unida nominees lost for governor in the general elections of 1972, 1974 (that’s no typo; governors through ‘74 had two-year terms) and 1978. Separately, Alonso Veloz was a Democratic candidate for governor in 1968 and Democrats Gary Espinosa and Felix (Rodriguez) Alvarado ran in 1994 and 2010, respectively. By phone, Martinez told us she had not heard of Aguado. Martinez then said that she is the first Latina to run for governor as a Republican. ""Perhaps I have to stress that,"" she said. When we looked a day later, her campaign website newly referred to her as the first Republican Latina to run for governor. Our ruling Martinez said that she’s the first Latina to run for governor of Texas. Election results indicate she is at least the second Latina aspirant behind Aguado, a Democrat who ran in 2010. We rate this claim, since amended on Martinez’s website, as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

"['Oregon', 'Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Jeff Merkley']","
Has the new health care law helped Oregon reduce the number of unisured by 10 percent?
","News that hundreds of thousands of Americans would not actually be able to keep their exact health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act has buffeted Washington. President Barack Obama and aides have had to repeatedly defend themselves against cries that they lied to the public. Obama isn’t alone, either. Anger about this revelation has turned into fodder for attacks on a number of Democrats including Oregon’s own Sen. Jeff Merkley. The Republican National Committee recently announced it had launched robocalls against the senator -- along with 10 other Democrats up for re-election -- accusing them of lying about the new law. The claim: In response, Merkley’s spokesman told The Oregonian that the law had already been extremely successful. ""Merkley spokesman Matt McNally responded with a statement saying that the new law has already reduced the number of uninsured people in Oregon by 10 percent,"" politics reporter Jeff Mapes wrote. We’d heard that number from the Oregon Health Authority and Gov. John Kitzhaber, as well. Plus, The Oregonian had reported on it (which is where Merkley's staff got it). Given that the online application system for Cover Oregon -- the state’s health exchange under the new law -- isn’t running, we were a little suspicious. We decided to take a closer look. The analysis: Our first call was to the Oregon Health Authority, where the 10 percent figure originated. Spokeswoman Patty Wentz broke down the math for us. Some background first, though: In 2011, the Oregon Health Authority conducted an exhaustive survey that found that nearly 15 percent -- or some 560,000 Oregonians -- did not have health insurance. When the Affordable Care Act passed, Oregon was one of several states that opted to expand its Medicaid program using federal dollars. To help enroll people in this expansion, the Oregon Health Authority looked at the people receiving food stamp benefits and determined who among them would be eligible for the expansion. Under a fast-track enrollment program, those folks were prequalified. Near the end of September, about 260,000 Oregonians received a letter informing them of their eligibility along with a mail-in application. As of Oct. 18, about 56,000 Oregonians had returned the applications -- that’s about 10 percent of the total uninsured. These days, the number is closer to 70,000. Of course, we thought it was important to know whether these new enrollees would have been eligible without the Affordable Care Act. Wentz checked and explained that while a segment of those newly enrolled in the Oregon Health Plan might have previously qualified, there’s no way all of them would have been accepted into the plan because of budgetary constraints. Oregon used to have a lottery to join the plan because it had too few slots for all the folks eligible. That lottery is now gone because the slots are unlimited; if you qualify, you get in. So, it is fair to say the Affordable Care Act -- or more specifically the Oregon Health Plan expansion it enabled -- is the reason these folks will be insured come 2014. Something else occurred to us, however. If this enrollment figure was Merkley’s defense of folks not being able to keep their insurance plans, was there anybody out there who might be losing their insurance as result of the ACA? Could that number offset these gains? Cheryl Martinis with the Oregon Insurance Division filled us in on those details. She told us Oregon has about 168,000 people with individual insurance. Of those, 23,000 will keep their grandfathered plans. However, 145,000 will see their insurance plans change to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. That said, none of them will find him or herself without insurance. Instead, they’ll be moved automatically to a new plan that most closely resembles whatever it was they had before the new law. This might not be ideal, of course, but it won’t leave them without a plan. One group could be out of luck, though. Some insurance companies offer what is called a portability plan. These plans are for people who lose or drop their employer-sponsored insurance. Basically, it’s an individual policy through the same insurance company, though they generally have different benefits than what was covered under the employer’s program. Nearly 14,000 people in Oregon are on these plans, and they will not necessarily automatically be switched to new ones. So, in effect, at least some of them will be forced back into the marketplace to look for insurance.   The ruling: Even if you count all of them as having lost their insurance, though, when Merkley’s staff referenced the 10 percent figure on Nov. 4, some 70,000 had received coverage through the fast-track program. That means you still have a net gain of 56,000 people covered. Put another way, Oregon had reduced its uninsured by 10 percent. We rate this claim True.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz says U.S. has averaged 0.9 percent growth over past four years
","He may have served in the Senate for less than a year, but Sen. Ted Cruz. R-Texas, has already made enough waves to secure a guest appearance on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. During the interview, Cruz took aim at the nation’s low rates of economic growth in recent years. ""You know,"" Cruz said, ""in the last four years, our economy has grown on average 0.9 percent a year. It’s not working."" We knew that in recent years, economic growth has been weaker than usual. But has it really been as low as Cruz said? Economic growth is measured by the change in gross domestic product (GDP) -- the sum of all economic activity for a nation -- over a given period of time. The two most common time periods for measuring GDP growth are over the course of one year and over the course of one quarter. (Quarterly growth measurements are typically multiplied by four so they can show how fast the economy would have grown if that expansion had continued all year long.) We turned to the official data for the nation’s gross domestic product, which is compiled by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. Whether Cruz is correct depends -- heavily -- on what time frame is used. One method uses data from the four most recent calendar years for which full-year data is available -- the full-year figures for 2008 through 2012. The percentage change in inflation-adjusted GDP was -2.8 percentage points in 2009, +2.5 points in 2010, +1.8 points in 2011, and +2.8 points in 2012. If you average these, it works out to a 1.1 percentage-point increase per year. Cruz is fairly close, but he’s still understating growth by more than one-fifth. Moreover, we have access to more current data. We now have quarterly data taking us through the first three-quarters of 2013. Measuring from the third quarter of 2009 through the third quarter of 2013 actually hews more closely to Cruz’s words -- ""in the last four years."" Calculating it this way, inflation-adjusted GDP increased, on average, 2.3 percent per year over the last four years -- almost two and a half times as fast as what Cruz indicated. When we checked with Cruz’s office, a spokeswoman explained that the figures they used ""are calculated using annual data, which is the most accurate way to compare growth year to year. The updated info you refer to is quarterly data, which is a small snapshot in time and doesn't reflect an accurate picture when compared to annual data from a previous year."" Several economists we checked with, however, disagreed, saying the difference between using annual figures and quarterly figures would be minimal, limited only to possible changes in the final quarter as soon as the current number, which is preliminary, is adjusted to account for late data. The economists we asked said that any change from using an adjusted figure for one quarter would be small, drowned out by data from the other 15 quarters used in the calculation. A much bigger factor is the time frame used. To use annual figures means that the calculation includes the disastrous first half of 2009, when the recession was still under way. By contrast, using the quarterly data replaces those three weak quarters of 2009 with three quarters of modest but positive economic growth from 2013.   Given the stark differences between the two methods, there’s a temptation to choose the method that bolsters your own preferences. However, the experts said that, given these two choices, the most appropriate way to calculate data for ""the last four years"" would be to use data that’s current, not nine months old. And this data shows growth of 2.3 percent. The one implication of Cruz’s comment that seems solid is that even 2.3 percent growth is low by historical standards, which has been a little more than 3 percent. Our ruling Cruz said that ""in the last four years, our economy has grown on average 0.9 percent a year."" Cruz has a point that economic growth has been below historical standards in recent years, but his estimates are low compared to both the calculations we did -- slightly low in one case, significantly lower in the other. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809727FF80>],/factchecks/2013/nov/13/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-us-has-averaged-09-percent-growth-ov/
"['Health Care', 'PunditFact', 'Sean Hannity']","
Sean Hannity says government predicted massive loss of health care
","There is a once-obscure government report that Obamacare’s critics don’t seem to be able to resist misquoting. Sean Hannity made this mistake on his Fox News show Monday. ""In July 2010 the government said small businesses -- 60 percent -- will lose their health care, 45 percent of big business and a large percentage of individual health,"" Hannity said. ""That's not 5 percent. That’s half of America. That's 128 million Americans, by their math, not mine."" Fox News told us that Hannity drew upon an article in Forbes that projected about 93 million people would not be able to keep their current plans under Affordable Care Act regulations. That article, plus a report from NBC, relied upon a government analysis from June 2010. It drew very little attention when it was published in the Federal Register. That has since changed. In this fact-check, we’re going to walk you through the report -- and why it doesn’t say what Hannity says it does. The 2010 federal report As part of the health care law, the federal government said people could keep the health insurance they had so long as the plan was in place before the health care law was passed in 2010. That’s the so-called ""grandfather"" provision. But if the plan changed -- sometimes even in ways people might consider minor -- people would have to purchase health insurance that meets new minimum standards. For some people, that could mean purchasing additional coverages for maternity and mental health care, which in turn could mean higher premiums. Back in 2010, three federal departments (Labor, Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service) tried to determine how many plans would change to the point that they would need to meet the new minimum standards. They looked at the historical patterns of insurance plans pre-Obamacare and tried to project what would happen in an Obamacare world. What they found is that many plans indeed would make the changes to trigger the new minimum standards. How many people would be affected? By the end of 2013, government analysts said half of all group or employer-based plans would change to the point that they would need to meet the new standards -- which is about what Hannity said. When combined with the number of people in the individual insurance market facing the same fate, government officials concluded that the health care plans of about 93 million to 99 million Americans would need to now meet the minimum standards created by the health care law. (Hannity said 128 million, which we’ll address shortly.) So why is Hannity wrong? The problem for Hannity is that the government analysts did not try to determine how many of those millions of Americans are in health insurance plans that already meet the minimum standards. That’s an important distinction because if plans already meet the minimum standards, the health care law has a modest impact. Robert Kaestner, a professor at the Institute for Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois, told us that most large employers already do what the law demands. ""The requirements are not that binding because many of these plans adhere to the requirements already,"" Kaestner said. A 2013 survey by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans backs up Kaestner’s point. It found that about three-quarters of the employer-sponsored health plans it contacted already meet the criteria of the health care law. The survey included both large and small employers and was based on 966 responses from human resource officers and benefits consultants. While we don’t know exactly how many plans already meet the new minimum standards and how many don’t, there’s nothing in the government report to suggest that the reality is close to the 128 million that Hannity claimed. The difference between a changed plan and no plan at all Hannity said a total of 128 million Americans will lose health care. This is quite similar to a mistake Glenn Beck made, and we repeat this key point: A change in a plan is not the same as losing health coverage. One of the highest estimates of how many people will see their plans change comes from Christopher Conover, a researcher at Duke University and an adjunct scholar with the American Enterprise Institute. (The American Enterprise Institute and its scholars have generally been critical of the health care law.) Fox News noted that Hannity had interviewed Conover and relied on his work. But even Conover doesn’t back up Hannity’s claim. Conover estimated that as many 135 million people would see their plans affected, although his mid-range figure was 129 million. But Conover draws a line between seeing your plan change and losing your health care. ""Let me clear that I am not predicting that 135.8 million Americans have or will have their policies canceled due to Obamacare,"" Conover wrote. Scott Harrington, professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, was equally emphatic. ""Losing grandfathered status does not mean that you lose your health insurance,"" Harrington said. Our ruling Citing a government report, Hannity said ""small businesses -- 60 percent -- will lose their health care, 45 percent of big business and a large percentage of individual health."" The government report did not say that. The report attempted to quantify the number of insurance plans that -- through the normal ebbs and flows of the market -- would change to the point that they would trigger new minimum standards. Put another way, government analysts tried to quantify how many plans would lose their grandfathered status. But they didn’t look at the coverage those plans offered. In those terms, many of the plans that will lose their grandfathered status already met the new minimum standards. We rate Hannity’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809727F980>],/factchecks/2013/nov/13/sean-hannity/hannity-says-government-predicted-massive-loss-hea/

Did Medicare Part D have the same rollout problems as the Obamacare online marketplaces?
","Democrats are pleading for patience as they try to reassure the country that the online insurance marketplaces critical to President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul can be fixed. Big programs have seen rocky rollouts only to achieve success later, they say. Their top example: the 2005 launch of Medicare Part D, President George W. Bush’s prescription drug benefit plan. ""Things went wrong with the Medicare prescription D plan that George Bush rolled out,"" Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., told MSNBC on Nov. 6. ""When things go wrong, there are two things we can do as a country. We can spend all our time figuring out who to blame, or we can spend all our time figuring out how to fix it."" Eight years after it went live, Medicare Part D is now widely popular among the seniors who use it. Were there major problems with the rollout of Medicare Part D? And were they comparable to the challenges facing Obamacare? We decided to take a more a detailed look at its implementation. Strangely similar Let’s play a quick game: who made this statement? ""This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal is the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches."" A Democrat in 2013? Wrong! Actually, it was Rep. Joe Barton, a Texas Republican who chaired the House Energy and Commerce Committee, about Medicare Part D in 2006. The similarities between the two health care programs, both heralded as the signature domestic achievements of the presidents who signed them into law, are at times eerie. Supporters of the laws asked for time and promised a quick fix. Critics did not mince their words. Even the lingo -- words like ""glitches"" -- has been recycled. A report documenting the history of Medicare Part D was released earlier this year by a group of health policy experts at the Center on Health Insurance Reform at Georgetown University. It highlighted several areas where Medicare Part D struggled in its implementation that sound extremely familiar. For one thing, the Bush administration faced a difficult political battle to get the bill passed in 2003. That damaged public opinion of the law, making it a challenge to educate 43 million seniors on its nuances. Enrollment in the law was set to begin in late 2005. In April of that year, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that only 27 percent of respondents understood the law, while only 21 percent favored it. (In a comparable Kaiser poll in April 2013, 35 percent viewed the Affordable Care Act favorably and less than half felt they were well-informed of its details.) The Medicare site, meant to help seniors pick benefit plans, was supposed to debut Oct. 13, 2005, but it didn’t go live until weeks later in November. Even then, ""the tool itself appeared to be in need of fixing,"" the Washington Post reported at the time. ""Visitors to the site could not access it for most of the first two hours. When it finally did come up around 5 p.m., it operated awfully slowly,"" the Post reported. (Sensing a pattern?) Once seniors began to enroll, problems persisted. According to the report, the online tools had ""accuracy problems,"" and local organizations designated with assisting seniors ""reported problems getting necessary and accurate information."" Call centers provided by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services underestimated ""the needed capacity to ensure that reliable answers could be provided"" and ""service representatives were not knowledgeable or failed to provide accurate information."" The Georgetown experts anticipated similar hiccups with the Affordable Care Act, noting that the country’s experience with Medicare Part D suggested ""the experience will be far from perfect"" and ""problems were not always addressed as quickly or as thoroughly as critics would have liked, but fixes were usually found."" These days, nine in 10 seniors who utilize the program report they are satisfied with it. ""There’s really a striking amount of similarity even though this time it’s a far larger and daunting task. It’s a fair comparison,"" said Jack Hoadley at the Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute and one of the authors of the study. ""Once something works its way through the problems, you forget the problems."" Still different But there are important differences between Medicare Part D and the Affordable Care Act that make the challenges facing the exchanges different. Because it was aimed at seniors and e-commerce was still relatively young, Medicare.gov was not intended to be the main hub for people to purchase and review plans, said David Brailer, the first National Coordinator for Health Information Technology under Bush. ""The issue with Medicare Part D is there were choices of 70 to 100 plans,"" Brailer said. ""People were overwhelmed with the choices, with the options available and didn't know how to navigate and pick one. I don’t remember a conversation at all blaming any IT people. This was about how do you really navigate through all these choices."" Meanwhile, most people who logged on to healthcare.gov in the opening weeks couldn’t even get far enough to review what options were available. Also, prescription drugs are a relatively small and easy-to-understand part of health care. Shopping for an insurance plan is more complicated. ""For those who did choose to enroll (in Medicare Part D) online, they checked out their options by typing in drugs they used, and once you did, you got an estimated out-of-pocket cost to make your comparisons. In the exchange world you have a full health care benefit to buy,"" Hoadley said. ""The drug cost is relatively predictable, certainly a lot more predictable than overall health costs. The challenge for this website is a lot greater, probably by a significant amount of magnitude."" And there’s the political climate as well. When Medicare Part D passed, Democrats were not happy with the final bill and were critical of its botched rollout. But even then, they were generally supportive of its intended outcome and worked with constituents who had difficulty signing up or utilizing their new benefits. When Medicare Part D faced early troubles, many blue states came to its rescue. The New York Times reported in 2006 that ""about 20 states, including California, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and all of New England, have announced that they will help low-income people by paying drug claims that should have been paid by the federal Medicare program."" By contrast, not a single Republican voted for the Affordable Care Act, and in the years since it passed, the party has made its repeal a top priority. In the states, many Republican governors have bucked the Medicaid expansion and rejected offers to build their own insurance marketplaces, putting greater pressure on the federal government. Henry Aaron, a health policy expert at the Brookings Institute, said the opposition from Republicans has forced the Obama administration into a ""two-front war"" Bush did not have to fight. ""On the one hand, one must and should address the administrative problems that no one denies is plaguing the problem,"" he said. ""But you’re also waging a war of public opinion against the hysterics of its critics."" Our ruling Israel said, ""Things went wrong with the Medicare prescription D plan that George Bush rolled out."" There definitely were problems, and in some cases, the parallels between the prescription benefit program’s introduction and the Obamacare marketplaces are strikingly similar. While we also found some serious differences in the laws, we can’t find fault with Israel’s fairly general statement. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809772EF40>],/factchecks/2013/nov/13/steve-israel/medicare-part-d-and-obamacare-health-care-gov/
