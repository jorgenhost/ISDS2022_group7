Did Luke Messer and Mike Braun raise taxes in Indiana?
","In Indiana’s Republican primary, no candidate for U.S. Senate wants to be accused of hiking taxes. So when U.S. Rep. Todd Rokita called out his fellow challengers, U.S. Rep. Luke Messer and Mike Braun, for raising taxes in the April 23 debate, we budgeted some time for a fact-check. ""I am the only one onstage who has never voted to raise your taxes,"" Rokita said. ""These two, each, a billion dollars worth of votes to raise your taxes."" Is that the case? The answer depends on what defines a tax increase. Through one lens Rokita may have a point. Through another, his comment can be seen as misleading. Whether these actions are turn-offs for conservative voters May 8 is for them to decide: The Braun and Messer tax hikes were approved by a Republican-controlled Legislature and a Republican governor. Rokita, Indiana’s former secretary of state, has only been in a position to raise taxes since he was elected to Congress in 2010. Congress has been under partial or total Republican control since that time, preventing votes on direct tax increases. (More on that in a minute.) Unlike his competitors, he did not serve as a state legislator. Rokita joined the Indiana secretary of state’s office in 1997 as general counsel, later becoming deputy secretary of state. He won two terms as secretary of state before moving to Washington in 2010. As secretary of state, Rokita had no budget-adopting or tax-approving authority. ""It is usually easier for someone who has served less time in legislative bodies to make the argument being made by Rokita,"" said Paul Helmke, a professor at Indiana University’s School of Public and Environmental Affairs. Braun and Messer, on the other hand, are associated with a couple of tax hikes from their time in the state Legislature. Messer’s team argued that Rokita’s record of no tax votes is not so clear. Messer’s campaign pointed to the FAST Act, a transportation bill that tied customs user fees to inflation, increasing funding for highway spending by $5.2 billion over 10 years. But the transportation bill also won the vote of Messer, elected to Congress in 2012. Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, said this qualifies as a tax, because the government is imposing new charges on private market transactions. The same reasoning would apply to a bipartisan 2012 tariff on imports that Rokita supported. Helmke, on the other hand, didn’t consider the fee a tax hike because it was not assessed on the general population, as most people are not direct customs users. And while tariffs can lead to increased costs, he didn’t consider a vote to give the Commerce Department authority to impose a tariff as a vote for a tax hike. To understand Rokita’s point against Braun, you have to hit the road. Rokita pointed us to road funding legislation supported by Braun and signed into law by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb in 2017. It came with a 10 cent per gallon gas statewide tax increase. The measure’s Republican sponsors said the tax hike would raise an average of $915 million a year in each of the next seven years. That’s pretty close to the $1 billion figure Rokita lobbed. The nonpartisan Indiana Legislative Services agency estimated the tax increase would bring in roughly $5 billion over a seven-year period. The main sponsor of the measure, GOP Rep. Ed Soliday, insisted it was not a tax hike but an adjustment to restore the state's buying power lost to inflation. Others called it a user fee, which affects only users of a service. But Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University, didn’t mince words. ""Most people would say the gas tax is a tax and pretty hard for us to avoid,"" Hicks said. Rokita, however, previously supported the same tax hike when he was secretary of state. ""There’s already been 19 or 20 states that have raised their gas tax, because the federal government won’t, and as a result are going to have a better infrastructure,"" Rokita told Indianapolis radio host Abdul Hakim-Shabazz in 2015. ""And by the way, I don’t know of a politician that’s been unelected for that yet. So, I encourage all those in elective office — from the federal, to the state, to the local level — to look at these ideas."" The call to action followed a month-long emergency closure of an interstate bridge that sank several inches in Rokita’s district in August 2015. Experts had a tougher time calling Messer’s legislative actions tax hikes. The first half of Messer’s tax hikes come from a 2005 bill to finance a new Colts Stadium in Indianapolis, signed into law by Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels. The bill didn’t directly raise taxes, but authorized local governments to do so. That included taxes on food, beverages, hotels, motels and auto rentals. Much of the tax fell on tourists, Hicks said. And it was at the behest of the local governments. ""It was an increase that the legislators from the affected counties all asked for,"" Hicks said. ""It’s inaccurate to say this was a tax hike the state was responsible for. The local governments didn’t have to do it."" In effect, Messer voted to allow certain counties to raise taxes by close to a billion dollars, according to the principal and interest payments on the bonds that financed the stadium. The other half of the attack on Messer comes from a 2005 budget that affected property taxes. The budget included language that reduced a state credit to local governments for property taxes. Without the credit, more taxes fell on property owners. It also altered the way property taxes were assessed, raising taxes for properties that had been previously undervalued by assessors. Statewide property taxes increased by an average of 24 percent, according to Larry DeBoer, agricultural economics professor at Purdue University, though some surprised homeowners received rebates that helped ease the burden. ""But back then a taxpayer group threw tea bags into an Indianapolis canal in protest — perhaps we can claim the first modern tea party movement here in Indiana, for better or worse,"" he said. Hicks said it was irresponsible to consider this hike without considering the large property tax cuts that followed, in 2008. But Messer was out of the state House by then. Rokita said, ""I am the only one onstage who has never voted to raise your taxes. These two, each, a billion dollars worth of votes to raise your taxes."" There is some truth in that Rokita has never voted to raise taxes in Indiana. As secretary of state, he did not have that power. In Congress, neither Rokita nor Messer have voted for direct tax increases. But Rokita voted for bills that raised user fees and import tariffs, which affected some taxpayers. (Messer, too, voted in favor of the user fees.) Braun indeed voted to increase taxes by almost $1 billion annually in a 2017 road funding law. Left unsaid by Rokita: He supported the gas tax from the sidelines, because it would lead to better infrastructure. Rokita also left out important context for Messer’s two 2005 votes that indirectly raised taxes by over $1 billion. One allowed local governments to increase taxes to fund the Indianapolis Colts football stadium. Another cut subsidies and changed the way property taxes were assessed. Overall, we rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC63BFC0>],/factchecks/2018/apr/30/todd-rokita/did-luke-messer-and-mike-braun-raise-taxes-indiana/

Were Diamond and Silk paid by the Trump campaign?
","Pro-Donald Trump activists Diamond and Silk insisted in sworn congressional testimony that they never received payment from Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.

Richardson explained the money was reimbursement for travel expenses the sisters incurred for airfare to a 2016 event called Women for Trump. The reference to ""field consulting,"" she said, may have been a mistake on the Trump campaign’s part. Bradley Crate, the treasurer for Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., sent PolitiFact an email that corroborated the sisters’ claim about reimbursement: ""The issue regarding Diamond and Silk is merely one of semantics, resulting from a reasonable misunderstanding of the Campaign’s reporting obligations. The Campaign’s payment to Diamond and Silk for field consulting was based on an invoice they submitted reflecting their costs for air travel to a Campaign event. The invoice was not supported by accompanying receipts, so as a technical matter, could not be reported as a reimbursement even though its purpose was to make them whole for their out-of-pocket costs."" Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at Public Citizen, a progressive consumer rights advocacy group, said, ""The payment sounds like a reasonable reimbursement of travel costs."" But he noted because the payment was not accompanied with receipts and was thus declared as payment for services by the Trump campaign, the activists ""are obligated to declare it as income and pay taxes on it."" That said, reasonable people can disagree about whether reimbursement for travel expenses constitutes ""pay"" or not.

"['Elections', 'Public Safety', ""The 2018 California Governor's Race"", 'California', 'Guns', 'Gavin Newsom']","
Gavin Newsom’s False claim he was ‘first to take on the NRA and win’
"," In 2016, the Democrat and frontrunner in the race for California governor led the passage of Proposition 63. The voter-approved measure imposed background checks on ammunition purchases and required a state license to sell ammunition, among other provisions. Gun rights groups opposed it. But did that effort qualify Newsom as ""the first to take on the National Rifle Association and win""? That’s one of the claims in a new TV ad that aired statewide this week and was paid for by Newsom’s campaign.  Here’s the full text: ""The LA Times called Gavin Newsom ahead of the pack, from gay marriage to gun control. The first mayor to recognize marriage equality. The first to provide healthcare to every resident. The first to take on the National Rifle Association and win. The one candidate with a record of bold leadership and bold results. It’s why Kamala Harris, teachers, nurses and firefighters support Gavin Newsom for governor. Courage for a change."" In an article earlier this week, we took a broad look at the claims in Newsom’s TV ad, a 30-second spot called ""First."" We also examined claims in a separate TV ad supporting former Los Angeles mayor and candidate for governor Antonio Villaraigosa. With this fact check, we’ll take a deeper look at the claim Newsom was ""the first to take on the National Rifle Association and win."" Haven’t other California politicos taken on the NRA and won? 'Hardly the first' In a column for CALmatters, Dan Morain summarized efforts by other Californians who pushed for gun safety measures — decades before Newsom. We used that summary as a guide and inspected additional gun control efforts in the state. As noted by Morain, Newsom was ""hardly the first California big city politician to take on the NRA."". Sherry Bebitch Jeffee, professor of public policy at USC, added the claim about Newsom being ""first,"" doesn’t hold up to the facts. ""California’s been at the forefront of the gun control movement for a very long time,"" Jeffee said. Here’s a look at earlier efforts by prominent California politicians: Dianne Feinstein In 1983, then-San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein defeated an NRA-supported recall, Morain noted. The recall started after Feinstein backed a failed statewide initiative to regulate handguns. Feinstein’s signature gun control measure came two years into her career in the U.S. Senate. She introduced and helped pass the now-expired 1994 federal assault weapons ban, which was also opposed by the NRA. Tom Bradley In 1989, then-Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley signed a city ordinance that banned the sale or possession of semi-automatic weapons. Morain described that as ""as a landmark bill at a time when the NRA was able to win elections in California."" Antonio Villaraigosa Villaraigosa also has gun control credentials. In 1999, then-Assembly Speaker Villaraigosa helped pass a statewide assault weapons ban, though he did not author it. ""The time is now to ban assault weapons,"" he was quoted as saying in a San Francisco Chronicle article at the time. ""It is time to use the power of the Legislature to say with one loud voice that we should all move beyond Columbine."" Luis Vizcaino, a spokesman for Villaraigosa’s campaign for governor, described the former LA mayor’s gun control efforts in a statement to PolitiFact California: ""Mayor Villaraigosa has been taking on the NRA throughout his career. Under his speakership, California passed some of the boldest gun control measures in the country, including what was at the time the toughest assault weapons ban in the nation and greater oversight of gun shows -- all of which was vigorously opposed by the NRA."" More from Newsom Newsom’s gun control history isn’t limited to 2016. During his time as San Francisco's mayor, Newsom signed into law the voter-approved Proposition H in 2005. It outlawed citizens from possessing handguns and prevented the manufacture, sale and distribution of guns and ammunition in the city. However, it was struck down by a San Francisco Superior Court judge less than a year after it was passed. In a phone interview earlier this week, Newsom’s campaign spokesman Nathan Click expanded on the claim that Newsom was ""the first to take on the National Rifle Association and win."" He clarified that it was intended to show Newsom was the ""first person in California history to propose and pass a statewide ballot measure strengthening gun safety laws."" As the claim is made in the ad, text appears showing a headline ""Newsom Fights The NRA Over Gun Control."" This appears to be a reference to an October 2017 Los Angeles Times news article with a similar headline. It describes Newsom’s request that a federal judge lift an order that blocked Proposition 63’s ban on large-capacity ammunition magazines. We didn’t find any information in the article or elsewhere showing Newsom’s argument swayed the judge to lift the order. ""When you’re trying to convey a series of ideas in 30 seconds, you’re limited by the format,"" Click added. He said the ad did not intend to discount earlier accomplishments by other California politicians. While that’s helpful, PolitiFact places ratings on the original statements, not revisions or clarifications. Our ruling A TV advertisement by the Gavin Newsom for Governor campaign claimed Newsom was ""the first to take on the National Rifle Association and win."" The claim, however, ignores major gun control measures passed by California politicians from U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein to former Los Angeles mayors Tom Bradley and Antonio Villaraigosa, in the face of NRA opposition. Newsom’s campaign spokesman said the claim in the ad was meant to convey a more specific accomplishment, showing Newsom as the first to push through a statewide gun safety ballot measure. We’re not challenging that statement. But we rate the original claim as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

"['National', 'Iran', 'Nuclear', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump says Iran got $150 billion and $1.8 billion in cash. That's Half True
","In a wide ranging phone call to Fox & Friends, President Donald Trump repeated his objection to the 2015 nuclear agreement that rolled back Iran’s nuclear program. ""The past administration made a horrible deal giving $150 billion,"" Trump said April 26 on the Fox News morning show. ""Giving $1.8 billion in cash — in actual cash carried out in barrels and in boxes from airplanes."" Of the two numbers he gave, $150 billion and $1.8 billion, the first is dodgy and the second is slightly exaggerated. And there’s no evidence that barrels and boxes were involved. We reached out to the White House and will add their response when it arrives. The 2015 agreement freed up Iranian assets that had been frozen under sanctions. Called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the deal included Iran and the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. The agreement only affected sanctions imposed to punish Iran for its nuclear program. Iran has other assets that remain frozen. Some conservatives have put the amount released after lifted sanctions as high as $150 billion, which is the highest of estimates we have seen. Another estimate from Iran’s Central Bank topped out at about $29 billion in readily available funds, with another $45 billion tied up in Chinese investment projects and the foreign assets of the Iran’s Oil Ministry. After talking with officials at Iran’s Central Bank, Nader Habibi, professor of economics of the Middle East at Brandeis University, believes the actual total is between $25 billion and $50 billion. In July 2015, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told lawmakers Iran would gain access to $56 billion. It’s important to know that little of that money was under the control of the United States or any U.S. bank. Most of it, Habibi said, was in central and commercial banks overseas. Furthermore, it was Iran’s money to begin with, not a payment from any government to buy Iran’s cooperation. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, reviewed this cash transfer in a 2018 report. It gave a total of $1.7 billion. That was the amount that U.S. and Iranian negotiators settled on to resolve an arms contract between the United States and Iran that predated the Iranian revolution in 1979. Iran had paid for military equipment, and it was never delivered. As of 1990, there were $400 million in that account. Negotiators agreed that accrued interest would add $1.3 billion to the amount, which is a lot of money — but 25 years is a long time for interest to build up the balance. The United States sent the money to Iran in euros, Swiss francs and other currencies. Trump embellished when he mentioned barrels and boxes. Reports at the time said the money was packed and loaded onto pallets, similar to how other bulk goods are shipped. Trump said that the nuclear deal with Iran gave the country $150 billion, including $1.8 billion from the United States in cash. The $150 billion is the highest estimate we've seen, and the one with the least evidence to support it. The high-end estimate from the U.S. Treasury Department in 2015 was $56 billion, and outside analysts believe the number could be lower. The $1.8 billion is reasonably accurate. The official amount is $1.7 billion. However, there’s no evidence that barrels and boxes were involved.

Yes, $1 million from Mitt Romney’s failed White House bid is fueling his Senate run
","A Democratic candidate for Utah’s U.S. Senate seat claimed Republican opponent Mitt Romney is using $1 million of leftover donations to his unsuccessful presidential run to finance his Senate bid. ""The former Governor of Massachusetts is taking yet another short cut to the Utah Senate Seat,"" Nickie Titus, campaign manager for Democrat Jenny Wilson, said in a press release. ""Mitt certainly does things his way — moves to Utah from California (and) uses a million of his presidential campaign dollars to finance his Utah senate race."" It turns out Wilson’s campaign is right: Romney is using $1 million from his failed presidential bid to fuel his Senate campaign. Experts told us this is common in politics, though the practice has come under criticism. Romney’s failure to reach the White House in 2008 and 2012 is not without a silver lining. It elevated Romney’s public stature, gave him staying power in Republican politics and left him with a substantial — and flexible — bankroll. Campaign finance rules have long allowed a candidate to hold on to surplus campaign funds indefinitely, said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at the group Public Citizen, a progressive consumer rights advocacy group. Under the Federal Election Campaign Act and Federal Election Commission rules, candidates can also make unlimited transfers of funds between campaigns, Holman said. ""It happens all the time,"" said Michael J. Malbin, the executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute, a campaign finance policy think tank. ""House members take their bankrolls to run for the Senate, senators to run for president. As long as the money was raised for a federal office under federal contribution limits, it's okay."" Holman argued just because the practice is widespread doesn’t mean it’s fair. He said the policy can create an uneven playing field and permits candidates to use funds in a way that’s contrary to donors’ intentions. ""A donor may have supported Romney’s presidential campaign against the Democratic nominee, but not support Romney’s new campaign for Senate in the primary or general election,"" Holman said. ""Yet, under the law, Romney has the authority to use those donors’ funds without getting their approval."" At the beginning of 2018, Romney for President, Inc., the nonprofit organization that supported Romney’s failed 2012 presidential bid, had roughly $1.3 million cash on hand. On Feb. 5, the organization transferred $1 million to Romney for Utah, Inc., according to an FEC filing.   To the chagrin of Romney’s opponents, the transfer from Romney’s presidential campaign to his Senate run comprises donations made mostly by non-Utah residents, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. ""The $1 million is indicative of what we’re seeing from Mitt Romney. He’s bringing in national money to make this a national-profile race,"" Wilson told the Tribune. ""I’m a Utahn running for Utahns."" The April 15, 2018, FEC filing, which covered the first three months of the year, shows the organization also made smaller disbursements for consulting work, email services and bank fees. At the end of the reporting period, Romney for President, Inc., had $222,755 cash on hand. Wilson’s campaign said Romney is using ""a million of his presidential campaign dollars to finance his Utah senate race."" The nonprofit organization that collected money for Romney’s 2012 campaign transferred $1 million to Romney’s bid for Utah’s Senate seat. We rate this True.

"['Immigration', 'Wisconsin', 'Ron Johnson']","
Sen. Ron Johnson says people walk up to U.S. border, say a few words and are let in
","A caravan of Hondurans and other Central Americans fleeing poverty and gang violence by heading north through Mexico triggered a tweet storm from President Donald Trump. On April 2, 2018, Trump tweeted: ""The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our 'Weak Laws' Border, had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!"" The president continued to tweet about building a wall and securing the southern border of the United States as the White House announced a plan to deploy National Guard troops. In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker said he is committed to sending troops from the state's National Guard to the Mexican border if asked by the Trump administration. Meanwhile, the caravan that started off with more than 1,000 people had diminished a week later, with many migrants planning to remain in Mexico but some determined to continue their journey all the way to the U.S. border to apply for asylum in this country. On Friday, according to National Public Radio reports, the Central American migrants were gathering near the U.S. border and said they plan to request asylum from the U.S. government on Sunday. Into the midst of it all stepped U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, who declared during an April 3, 2018, interview on The Jeff Wagner Show on WTMJ radio (620 AM): ""We need to fix our horribly broken legal immigration system."" The senator went on to say: ""We have laws on the books where people can walk right up to our ports of entry, say ‘I have a credible fear of persecution,’ and we bring them in. We don’t send them back."" Is Johnson, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, correct? Is it that simple to get into the country? And to stay here? The evidence When asked for backup for the claim, Johnson’s staff pointed to a variety of situations and scenarios, including legal precedents (the 1997 Flores settlement); the Homeland Security Act; and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. An email from Johnson’s office also pointed to the issues of unaccompanied minors, immigration court capacity and hearings on border security, as well as ""credible fear"" claims. Let’s sort this out. It’s important to note Johnson’s claim focuses on those seeking asylum status. That is different than those who may seek to enter the country as refugees or other immigration channels. For example, the difference between asylees and refugees is procedural, according to AllLaw.com, a website that includes links to legal information, forms, and news. A person who requests asylum in the United States is called an asylee. A person who requests protection while still overseas, and then is given permission to enter the U.S., is called a refugee. An asylee, or a person granted asylum, is authorized to work in the United States, can apply for a Social Security card, can request permission to travel overseas and can petition to bring family members to the United States. Asylees may also be eligible for federal or Office of Refugee Resettlement benefits, such as Medicaid or Refugee Medical Assistance. After one year, an asylee may apply for permanent resident status (i.e., a green card). Once the individual becomes a permanent resident, he or she must wait four years to apply for citizenship. Testimony from border patrol agents and federal officials at Senate Homeland Security Committee hearings has included first-hand testimony from border agents and federal officials on the migrants presenting themselves at the border, citing fear of being accosted, forced into or killed by Central American gangs. Others have claimed they cannot return to their country of origin because of fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a political social group, or political opinion. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website details a variety of guidelines on how to proceed when migrants arrive at the border seeking asylum, including details on the definition for ""credible fear of persecution or torture"": Q.   What is a Credible Fear of Persecution? A.   A ""significant possibility"" that you can establish in a hearing before an Immigration Judge that you have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of your race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion if returned to your country. Q.   What Is a Credible Fear of Torture? A.   A ""significant possibility"" that you can establish in a hearing before an Immigration Judge that you would be subject to torture if returned to your country. Asylum denials Contrary to what Johnson’s claim suggests, denials of asylum by immigration judges have been rising. As of the end of September 2016, overall asylum denial rates for fiscal year 2016 had risen to 57 percent. The total number of asylum denials from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2016 was 125,066, or 49.8 percent, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse TracImmigration. Among the number of Immigration Court asylum cases decided during fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2016, Mexico had the highest number of denials, with 12,028, or 89.6 percent. Others with high rates of denials include El Salvador with 11,546, or 82.9 percent; Honduras with 7,350, or 80.3 percent; Haiti with 1,599, or 80.1 percent; and the Dominican Republic, with 407 denials, or 87 percent.   A 2017 analysis by Reuters illustrated that the difference between an asylum seeker being granted residency or ordered deported depends largely on which judge hears the case, and where. Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TracImmigration), confirmed that report. The median level of asylum decision disparity that asylum seekers face is now over 56 percentage points. That is, the assignment of the judge for the typical asylum seeker could alter the odds of receiving asylum by this magnitude. For example, while the specific ranges differed by court, the typical asylum seeker might have only a 15 percent chance of being granted asylum all the way up to a 71 percent chance depending on the particular judge to whom their case is assigned. In addition, Johnson’s argument that ""we don’t send them back"" comes with a major caveat. Under international law, the United States can’t simply ""send them back,"" according to a Yale Law School report: Summary removal procedures put the United States at risk of violating the principle of non-refoulement, which forbids states from forcibly repatriating individuals who have legitimate claims for international protection. To satisfy its obligations under the Refugee Convention, the United States must provide arriving noncitizens a genuine opportunity to pursue asylum claims prior to their removal. A Trump directive calls for expediting eligibility claims of those attempting to stay in the United States and promptly deporting those whose claims are rejected. Unaccompanied minors Things work somewhat differently when children -- ""unaccompanied minors,"" in immigration parlance -- arrive at the border themselves. Those procedures are covered by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. In those cases, the children are screened and may be placed in the care of a sponsor – usually a parent, relative, or family friend – who can care for them while their immigration cases proceed. If the child fails to show up for a hearing, he or she can be ordered deported. However, deporting unaccompanied minors who are no shows in court is no easy task, because some do not stay at the addresses provided to the government and disappear into the general population. Expert opinion We also turned to Fatma E. Marouf, a professor of law and director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Texas A&M University School of Law, who made it clear it’s not as simple as saying the right words and being allowed to stay. ""If they pass the credible fear interview, they will be placed in removal proceedings and have an opportunity to apply for asylum in immigration court. If their case is denied, they will be deported,"" he said. ""In some cases, (authorities) may choose to parole the person into the country instead of keeping him or her detained, but that is very much the exception, not the rule."" Our rating Johnson said ""We have laws on the books where people can walk right up to our ports of entry, say I have a credible fear of persecution, and we bring them in. We don’t send them back."" His claim is problematic on two fronts. First, those who make a ""credible fear"" claim are not simply brought into the United States. Rather, there is an extensive review process and, in some cases, asylum cases can take years. Second, statistics show that many have their cases rejected and are sent back -- including nearly 90% of those from Mexico. That said, the scenario Johnson lays out can happen with unaccompanied children who arrive at the border -- for example if they fail to show up for their hearing and disappear into the country instead. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA97040>],/factchecks/2018/apr/27/ron-johnson/sen-ron-johnson-says-people-walk-us-border-say-few/

Perry, the Republican former governor, often offers the ""blueberry"" characterization of the Democrat-dominant capital. On the program, a contestant correctly answered ""Austin"" for $600. Next, Adler said in his tweet, accompanied by a photo of the Jeopardy clue: ""What is the safest big city in Texas with an unemployment rate under 3% that has been named the best place to live in the entire United States two years running?"" Is all of that true about Austin? Not all: In 2017, we found Half True an Adler reference to Austin as the state's safest big city. Not for the first time, we noted then that the FBI advises against using crime data it collects to declare one city ""safer"" than another. That said, such statistics at the time suggested both that the five-county Austin region in 2015 had a lower violent-crime rate than other Texas regions and that El Paso had a lower violent-crime rate than Austin in the first half of 2016. Seeking mayor’s factual backup The morning after Adler posted his comment, which was retweeted more than 200 times, we reached mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford. Stanford advised by phone that Adler didn’t have fresh information to offer in support of his 2018 ""safest big city in Texas"" statement. He suggested we check federal statistics to confirm Austin’s jobless rate and told us that U.S. News had consecutively named Austin the nation’s best place to live. Checking Austin’s unemployment Our search for Austin’s jobless rate on the Texas Workforce Commission website showed that from January through March 2018, the latest month of available data, the city's jobless rate ran shy of 3 percent. We also fetched a longer view showing the city’s jobless rate mostly staying below 3 percent from January 2017 on (all the rates not seasonally adjusted). Austin's unemployment rate was last above 3 percent, according to the TWC, when it was 3.1 percent in August 2017. The Austin rate's 15-month low, 2.5 percent, occurred in December 2017:                  SOURCE: Website, ""Unemployment,"" Texas Labor Market Information, Texas Workforce Commission (search completed April 26, 2018) Austin ranked best place to live two times in a row On April 10, 2018, U.S. News announced that for the second straight year, the online publication found Austin the best place to live in the United States among the country's 125 largest metropolitan areas; Colorado Springs, Colo., placed second. The rankings were based on affordability, job prospects and quality of life, U.S. News said, and on surveying thousands of U.S. residents ""to find out what qualities they consider important in a home town. The methodology,"" U.S. News said, also factored in data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the FBI and the Bureau of Labor Statistics--plus U.S. News rankings of the country’s high schools and hospitals. Austin, the self-proclaimed Live Music Capital of the planet, earned a score of 7.7 out of 10 for the 2018 rankings, U.S. News said, with even its few downsides having upsides. The story says: ""The median sale price for a single-family home in Austin is well above the national median."" Then again, the story says, ""Austinites' pocketbooks benefit from no personal or corporate income tax, and a low state and local tax rate."" Another semi-warning in the story: ""Summers in Austin take some getting used to, with temperatures often scorching."" Though, the story says, the ""metro area experiences mild weather throughout the rest of the year, though temperatures have been known to drop in the winter."" The story also notes: ""Austin is among the nation's worst metro areas for traffic congestion."" But, the story says, that ""can be addressed with flexible work schedules, due diligence when choosing a neighborhood and, for those wanting to get in some exercise while commuting, using public transportation, walking and biking."" Our ruling Adler referred to Austin as the ""safest big city in Texas with an unemployment rate under 3% that has been named the best place to live in the entire United States two years running."" Hizzoner was right about Austin’s jobless rate of late and Austin getting named the city’s best place to live two years in a row though it’s worth clarifying that the rankings considered only the country’s 125 largest metro areas. Whether Austin is the safest big Texas city rests on interpreting crime data the FBI counsels against using to compare communities. This said, we previously found that the five-county Austin region in 2015 had a lower violent-crime rate than other Texas regions while in the first half of 2016, El Paso had a lower violent-crime rate than Austin. On balance, we rate this Adler claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Fact-checking the Donald Trump, Kanye bromance
","President Donald Trump took to the airwaves to tout his budding bromance with rapper Kanye West. The hosts of Fox & Friends asked Trump during an April 26 telephone interview about the enthusiastic tweets exchanged between the two men, such as this one. my MAGA hat is signed 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/DrDHJybS8V Trump turned his sudden friendship with West into a commentary about the economic results on his watch. Trump said, ""Kanye looks and he sees black unemployment at the lowest it’s been in the history of our country. He sees Hispanic unemployment at the lowest it’s been in the history of our country. He sees (women’s unemployment) the lowest it’s been in now almost 19 years."" Trump has previously made claims of this sort, but it’s been a few months, so we thought we’d take a new look at the numbers. In March 2018, the African-American unemployment rate stood at 6.9 percent. That’s not a record low, but it’s close — and the record low was 6.8 percent in December 2017, also on Trump’s watch. Here’s the full data for the black unemployment rate since the statistic was first calculated in 1972: The Hispanic unemployment rate was 5.1 percent in March 2018. That’s not a record either, but once again, it’s close. The Hispanic unemployment rate was as low as 4.8 percent three times in 2017, in June, October and November. Those low points all occurred on Trump’s watch. Here’s the full historical data: Currently, the unemployment rate for women is 4.0 percent. It was slightly lower during an earlier point in Trump’s presidency — 3.9 percent in October 2017. The women’s unemployment rate was lower still in December 2000, when it hit 3.8 percent. That falls within the 19-year windowTrump cited. Here’s the full run of data: Economists agree that presidents don’t deserve either full credit or full blame for the unemployment rate on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles. And to the extent that a president does deserve credit for low unemployment, Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, deserves at least as much as Trump does. As these charts show, the unemployment rate for blacks, Hispanics, and women declined dramatically on Obama’s watch as the country pulled out of the Great Recession. Black unemployment peaked at 16.6 percent in April 2010, when Obama was president. It then fell by more than half to 7.8 percent by the time Obama left office in January 2017. Hispanic unemployment, meanwhile, peaked at 13 percent in August 2009, then fell to 5.9 percent at the end of Obama’s term in January 2017. And unemployment among women peaked at 9 percent in November 2010, before falling to 4.8 percent by the time he left office in January 2017, a drop of nearly half. Trump said, ""Kanye looks and he sees black unemployment at the lowest it’s been in the history of our country. He sees Hispanic unemployment at the lowest it’s been in the history of our country. He sees (women’s unemployment) the lowest it’s been in now almost 19 years."" The unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanics have hit all-time lows in recent months on Trump’s watch, and the rate for women was recently the lowest it’s been in more than 18 years. But it’s worth remembering that,to the extent that presidents deserve any credit for economic conditions on their watch, the heavy lifting in getting rates that low occurred before Trump became president.

Did Gov. Rick Scott sign a bill that could make most beaches private?
","Confusion about what a new law means for Florida beaches is prompting fears and political attacks. Advocacy group For Our Future Florida used HB 631 as a wedge in the U.S. Senate race, where Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson is facing a challenge from Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who signed the bill into law in March. ""On #EarthDay, we want to thank @SenBillNelson who has always fought for and defended the health of Florida’s coastlines and environment, while @FLGovScott just signed a bill that could make most of Florida’s beaches private,"" For Our Future Florida tweeted April 22. On #EarthDay, we want to thank @SenBillNelson who has always fought for and defended the health of Florida’s coastlines and environment, while @FLGovScott just signed a bill that could make most of Florida’s beaches private. pic.twitter.com/73MsfRdg49 Please pause before cancelling your summer vacation. This claim needs a fact-check. In reality, more than half of Florida beaches are already privately owned. The new law, opposed by many environmental groups, affects the procedure for local governments that want to make private beaches public. Starting July 1, any city or county that wants to enact an ordinance to make private beaches public will have to go through the courts. The sound bite from For Our Future Florida rests on the notion that private beach owners will use the law to limit public access. But we don’t know how those owners will react. The law Scott signed isn’t going to turn beaches that are public now over to private ownership. What it will do is make it harder to guarantee public access on beaches that were already privately owned. Before the new law, local governments could adopt ordinances guaranteeing the public’s access to privately owned beach property. Those ordinances stemmed from a legal principle known as ""customary use."" ""Customary use"" refers to the public’s historic access to the dry sand portion of the beach that may belong to a private property owner. ""The idea and custom goes all the way back to ancient Rome and falls under the same set of ideas as the sea belongs to everyone and all have an equal right to use it,"" said David Cullen, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, which opposed the bill. For example, the owners of an oceanfront estate in South Beach may decide they do not like that beachgoers are setting up camp on the shoreside portion of their property. They install a fence and ""no trespassing"" signs to tell the public to stay away. The Florida Supreme Court ruled that if a private property owner tries to do this, then the local government could enact an ordinance guaranteeing the public’s use of that land under ""customary use,"" following their usual notice and hearing process. If landowners wanted to challenge the ordinance, they would have to sue the local government. Lawmakers drafted HB 631 to put more of the onus on the government and to establish a uniform process that includes all the stakeholders. A situation in the Panhandle’s Walton County, which passed ordinances based on this ""customary use"" doctrine in 2016, illustrates why some lawmakers supported the bill. After the ordinance was passed in Walton County, some beach property owners filed lawsuits to overturn it. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida upheld the county’s ordinance, but landowners appealed that decision.   ""Without the courts involved on the front end, individual property owners could and did sue to challenge county ordinances around the state,"" said Rep. Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast, in a letter to the editor for the Palm Coast Observer website. ""The taxpayers were on the hook for legal fees to defend every individual case against the county and pay any damages awarded if the county got it wrong."" Starting July 1, local governments that seek to adopt an ordinance that is premised on customary use rights must first notify all the owners of land that might be implicated, and then file a proceeding in court. The court will decide the question of whether the public has customary use rights in that specific area. The Sierra Club’s Cullen predicts the law will embolden people to stick fences and ""no trespassing"" signs on their properties. If that happens, local governments will have a bigger legal hurdle to clear before guaranteeing the public’s access to that area. That said, the new law does not affect any property or beach use rights. It doesn’t affect the rights the public had to use the dry sand beach before it was enacted, nor does it affect landowners’ rights. Law experts and leaders in the beach communities emphasized that the public should not feel compelled to change patterns of historic beach usage as a result of the law’s passage. ""If the public has customary use rights in a given area, the statute doesn’t change that in any way,"" said Alyson Flournoy, a University of Florida Levin College of Law professor. ""Those common law rights exist, whether or not there is an ordinance and whether or not there has been a judicial decision. The rights may be contested, but that doesn’t mean they are any more or less valid after July 1, 2018."" For Our Future Florida said that Scott ""just signed a bill that could make most of Florida’s beaches private."" The law does benefit private beach owners in a way. But this is a poor explanation that obscures critical facts. The law Scott signed would not result in turning more public beaches into private ones. In reality, when the law takes effect, it will make it harder for local governments to guarantee public access to beaches that are already private by throwing in a new judicial obstacle. It’s unclear at this point how the law will change private beach access, because that depends on the actions of local governments and private beach owners. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC71C800>],/factchecks/2018/apr/26/our-future-florida/did-gov-rick-scott-sign-bill-could-make-most-beach/

No, California bill would not ban Bible sales
","Freedom of religion and speech are fundamental to American life, and some conservatives warn that a California bill threatens both. ""California State Assembly bill would BAN the Bible!"" said the April 19 headline on the Oath Keepers website. ""Whatever happened to Free Speech and Religious Freedom? Of course, this is the People’s Republic of California, so such things are to be expected. They are so far down the totalitarian, Globalist path that they are oblivious to any sane, sensible ideas."" The controversy is over California bill AB 2943, a measure that puts strict limits on programs that aim to change a person’s sexual orientation. The legislation, which passed out of the state assembly and over to the Senate, bans any ""advertising, offering to engage in, or engaging in sexual orientation change efforts with an individual."" The bill does this by amending the state’s consumer protection law, which covers such things as false advertising, selling defective goods and the like. So, the prohibition would only apply when money changed hands. Someone needs to be selling and someone needs to be buying a service called ""sexual orientation change efforts"" for this bill to apply. The Oath Keeper headline (since changed) spoke of a complete ban on the Bible with no mention of selling. But in the video interview that went along with the post, the Oath Keeper host asked, ""Would this prohibit the sale of the Bible?"" We’re checking whether the law would ban the sale of the holy book.  While the odds are remote, some legal scholars said the law as written could lead to issues. Even some opponents to AB 2943 argue that it likely wouldn’t ban the sale of Bibles across the board. ""It is virtually impossible that California will immediately attempt to ban the sale of the Bible itself,"" wrote Robert Gagnon in the Federalist. ""But citations of Bible verses in the context of declaring homosexual practice and transgenderism to be morally debased could indeed get one into serious trouble with the law if it comes in the context of selling or advertising a product or service."" Concerned Women for California of America, a group that ""promotes biblical values"" through prayer and advocacy, told lawmakers that the bill ""puts in question the sale of books, participation in events, and related activities."" So from opponents, the impact on Bible sales is a question, not a certainty. By one estimate, Americans buy about 25 million Bibles each year. Based on population, about 3 million would be sold in California. UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh dismissed the idea that simply selling the Bible would be affected, because people buy Bibles for many reasons that lie outside the bill. ""The ordinary sale would not be an effort to change sexual orientation,"" Volokh said. But on the other hand, Volokh can imagine circumstances when things would get muddy. ""There needs to be a practice that seeks to change the person's behavior,"" Volokh said. ""A Bible sold with an eye to that could be affected by this law."" Paul Horwitz at the University of Alabama School of Law said there’s a serious question that the law ""could include books arguing that one should refrain from homosexuality lest one be condemned or damned, and thus could include the Bible, at least as some read it."" Apart from any impact on Bible sales, the core ban on any program sold to change someone’s sexual orientation might itself fail on constitutional grounds, according to Jefferson Powell at Duke Law School. The bill fails to define what it aims to block, he said. ""The law can’t constitutionally apply to many forms of speech that have the purpose of persuading people not to act on, or enabling them not even to feel, same-sex attraction,"" Powell said. ""But the bill’s language displays no concern to tailor its scope to avoid those situations."" If the bill failed to pass constitutional muster, then the whole thing would be thrown out, along with any possible impact on the sale of Bibles. The legal dispute we found centered on whether the Bible itself argues for changing one’s sexual orientation and whether every paid effort to dissuade a person from homosexuality meets the legal definition of a sexual orientation change effort. Before all else, said University of Miami law professor Caroline Corbin, the Bible as a book lies outside the bill’s reach. ""The bill prohibits the provision of certain services and advertisements of those services, and the Bible is neither of those things."" But what if the Bible were part of some sort of sexual orientation conversion program? Douglas Laycock at the University of Virginia said ""no judge is that stupid"" to view the Bible so narrowly. ""The Bible is a vast collection of books,"" Laycock said. ""Only a few brief passages say anything about same-sex sexual conduct, and those don't say anything about sexual orientation, or about changing it."" In short, the Bible by itself is not a how-to kit for sexual orientation conversion. George Washington law professor Catherine Ross echoed that point and emphasized that simply calling homosexuality a sin would not meet the definition of a ""sexual orientation change effort."" ""A person selling or promoting the Bible could say that in this book you will discover what is good and bad and the book will tell you that to be LGBT is really bad,"" Ross said. ""But even that doesn't take the next step, and say that when you are convinced by reading this, the next step is to get into a Sexual Orientation Change program. And the statute is only triggered when a person promotes or advertises the Sexual Orientation Change Effort solution."" Ross also noted that the proposed law regulates commercial speech, which she said the Bible is not. ""The brief passages in the Bible that concern homosexuality would keep the book as a whole well below the standard for triggering the statute,"" Ross said. ""An offer to sell a Bible would not bring the content of the Bible itself into the definition of commercial speech."" The Oath Keepers group said that a California law would ban the sale of the Bible. We found that even some opponents of the bill don’t go that far. The general consensus is that the Bible covers a lot of ground and the proposed law would have no effect on the ordinary sale of Bibles. If the law had any impact at all, it would be on those occasions when a Bible is sold in conjunction with a program to change someone’s sexual orientation. This is a point where legal scholars differ. Some say the law could touch the sale of a Bible, while others believe the Bible lies outside the scope of the law. But even assuming the law might have an impact, with millions of Bibles sold in California, the weight of evidence suggests the bill might only touch a fraction of them. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC67780>],/factchecks/2018/apr/26/oath-keepers/no-california-bill-would-not-ban-bible-sales/

Dennis Kucinich said he didn't hide payment from Syria speech
","When Dennis Kucinich amended his financial disclosure to show that he was paid by a pro-Syrian government group, it set off a firestorm in the Democratic primary for Ohio governor. Former Gov. Ted Strickland, who supports Kucinich’s main rival Richard Cordray, accused Kucinich of trying to hide the $20,000 payment. ""The fact that Dennis intentionally omitted his ties to these despicable individuals speaks volumes, I think, and it shows he knew these relationships were problematic,"" Strickland said during a conference call with reporters arranged by the Cordray campaign. In 2017, Kucinich was paid by the Association for Investment in Popular Action Committees to give a speech in England at an event hosted by the European Centre for the Study of Extremism. The California-based association is the parent of the Syria Solidarity Movement, which says it takes no sides about Bashar Hafez al-Assad but appears sympathetic to the Syrian president. Kucinich disputed Strickland’s characterization that he hid anything in an interview with Cleveland radio talk show host Mike Trivisonno. ""There was no hiding,"" Kucinich said April 10. ""I released it,"" adding, ""I released the information. There’s no hiding here. I’ve never hid anything in my life."" Time for PolitiFact to weigh in. Did Kucinich hide who paid him for a $20,000 speech about Syria? Kucinich’s speech has become a hot topic in the crowded Democratic May 8 primary for governor. On his April 9  financial disclosure form, Kucinich listed ""paid speeches."" Ohio Ethics Commission Executive Director Paul Nick sent Kucinich an April 13 letter asking him to identify the source of the paid speeches. Most filers must list every source of income and briefly describe the services they provided, according to the instructions. Kucinich provided additional information to the commission showing that he was paid $20,000 by the Association for Investment in Popular Action Committees. He also wrote that he received $10,000 from Nexus Earth and $3,000 from author Marianne Williamson. Kucinich said he went beyond the disclosure requirements. ""I instantly not only said who I spoke to but I also said what the amount was, which I wasn’t required to do,"" he said in the radio interview. The amount of income is only required in some cases, such as if they were providing services to a lobbyist. Kucinich said that he should have included who paid him on his first filing. ""I made a mistake,"" he said. ""It was an omission. It was an error, but it wasn’t deliberate."" Kucinich has said that the conference was about peace. He posted an abstract of his 2017 speech, in which he said the West can’t impose its will on Syria. ""The Syrian people, who are not unanimous on the question of President Assad, are resolute in protecting their way of life, which includes free education and free health care, while supporting the Assad government from a military overthrow which would destroy Syria.""   Paul Larudee, a steering committee member of the Syria Solidarity Movement, told PolitiFact that it doesn’t support Assad or any candidate. ""We have no position on whether Assad should remain in power, and neither should the U.S. or your organization or anyone who is not Syrian,"" he said. ""This is for Syrians to decide without interference or outside pressure."" The Syria Solidarity Movement tries to cast doubt that Assad used a chemical attack and suggests the majority of Syrians support the Assad government. It includes articles with headlines such as ""Voices from Syria: Assad is Essential for Syria’s Unity & Security."" It calls for the West to not intervene and accuses human rights groups such as Doctors without Borders and Amnesty International of false allegations about the government in Syria. Robert S. Ford, former ambassador to Syria during the Obama administration and a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, told PolitiFact he is certain that the Syrian government used chemical weapons. Ford said the Syria Solidarity Movement appears to be""vehemently pro-Assad government, denying regime war crimes."" ""They are trying to discredit the harder-line opposition (secular and Islamist both) while recommending that the world accept the Russian-mobilized Succhi dialogue process,"" he said.  ""That process aims to keep Assad now in return for promise of reforms at some later date."" Kucinich has faced criticism in the past for meeting with Assad in 2017. His spokesman said that he held ""fact-finding missions to find a way to end the violence."" While in Congress, he opposed entering into war in Iraq and other military incursions. In April, Trump ordered a missile attack on Syria following reports that Assad’s regime used chemical attacks. Kucinich criticized that attack, stating that it ""puts the U.S. on a path of military escalation with Russia, which opens wide the possibility of further miscalculations, errors or accidents that can ignite a world war."" Regarding his $20,000 speech about Syria, Kucinich said, ""there was no hiding. I released it."" But Kucinich initially listed ""paid speeches"" on his campaign financial disclosure form with no further detail. When the Ohio Ethics Commission asked him to identify the source of payments, Kucinich provided the commission with a list of the entities that paid him to give speeches, including $20,000 from the Association for Investment in Popular Action Committees. So Kucinich initially omitted the information, but disclosed it when asked to do so by a state commission. He also admitted that he made an error by not initially disclosing the source of who paid him for the speech.

How much have Republicans cut EPA budget, staff in two years?
","The Environmental Protection Agency is not very popular among West Virginia Republicans, who see the agency as threatening the state’s mining jobs through overregulation -- at least until President Donald Trump took office. So, during an April 23 debate between Republican primary candidates for a U.S. Senate seat, it was not surprising to hear the agency criticized. One of the candidates, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins, boasted about his efforts to rein in the agency. ""I’ve cut a half a billion (dollars) out of the EPA just in the last two years. We’ve cut 3,000 jobs out of the EPA,"" he said. (It’s around 29:30 in the video.) We’ll look at the two parts of this statement separately -- first, the agency’s budget, and second, its employment level. Jenkins would have been more accurate if he’d said ""we’ve"" cut half a billion dollars, as he did in the second part of his statement. Obviously, in our constitutional system of checks and balances, individual U.S. House members cannot cut an agency’s budget on their own. On the more substantive question, however, Jenkins was on target. In fact, he lowballed it a little. Historical data from the Office of Management and Budget, shows spending by the EPA at $8.725 billion in 2016; $8.165 billion in 2017; and an estimated $7.916 billion in 2018. The two-year difference between 2016 and 2018 is $809 million, which is more than half a billion dollars, or a 9.2 percent reduction over that two-year span. The actual amount allowed by the omnibus spending bill passed after OMB made its estimate is slightly higher for 2018 -- $8.058 billion. But even at that higher level, the two-year decrease exceeds the half-billion-dollar figure Jenkins cited. Here’s a chart showing EPA’s budget going back to 2009: So Jenkins’ budget number appears solid. For employment, we used a data tool created by the federal Office of Management and Budget called FedScope, which federal employment gurus consider the most accurate information available. FedScope provides detailed employment data on a quarterly basis; the most recent quarter available at the time of Jenkins’ comment was September 2017. For simplicity, we took note of EPA employment in September of every year. In September 2015, EPA employed 15,445 people; in September 2016, it employed 15,634; and in September 2017, it employed 15,058. Over this two-year period, EPA employment fell by 387 people -- well short of the 3,000 Jenkins cited. The only way you can achieve a decrease of 3,000 EPA employees is by comparing the September 2017 level to the September 2012 level -- a five-year period that started before Jenkins was even in Congress. Moreover, EPA employment in 2012 was boosted by spending through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- more commonly known as the stimulus bill signed by President Barack Obama. So a chunk of the jobs lost since then were always intended to be temporary. This chart shows EPA employment every September going back to 2009, according to FedScope: When we asked the Partnership for Public Service, a group that studies federal employment, to look at our math, they agreed that it was accurate. Jenkins’ campaign said the candidate was referring to a news release from the House Appropriations Committee that mentioned a decline of 3,106 jobs at the EPA since 2010 -- a longer period than a listener would have assumed hearing Jenkins’ comments at the debate. When more recent data is released, it may show additional decreases in employment at EPA. An EPA plan for a government shutdown in December 2017 said the agency had a staff of 14,449, which was down from the prior shutdown plan in April, which cited a staff size of 15,219, according to the liberal website ThinkProgress. That’s a decline of 770, but it’s still not as high as the 3,000 Jenkins noted. Jenkins said, ""I’ve cut a half a billion (dollars) out of the EPA just in the last two years. We’ve cut 3,000 jobs out of the EPA."" Setting aside his choice of ""I"" rather than ""we,"" Jenkins has a point about the decrease in the EPA’s budget; in anything, his estimate is actually low. On employment, though, 3,000 jobs shed is an overzealous estimate. To get a number that large, you have to go back at least to 2012, before Jenkins was in Congress.

New York may raise wages for tipped workers. Here's what happened when Maine tried
","New York state leaders are thinking about raising the minimum wage for workers who earn tips in addition to their hourly rate. Sen. James Tedisco, a Republican from Schenectady County, says that idea didn’t work when it was tried in Maine two years ago. ""The state of Maine passed an initiative that abolished the tip credit,"" Tedisco wrote in a blog post, ""but less than a year later reversed that decision due to restaurant employees organizing en masse against the measure after they saw a significant decrease in earnings."" The state Department of Labor will decide later this year whether to end a practice that allows employers to pay tipped employees less than the state’s minimum wage. Tedisco is against the idea, saying it could do more harm than good for the state’s restaurant industry. He says restaurant workers in Maine were able to reverse an identical proposal in their state. Is he right about what happened? What’s happening in New York state The state Department of Labor is holding hearings across the state through June to consider raising the minimum wage for tipped workers. The proposal would not ban tipping. Tipped workers currently make between $7.50 and $10.85 an hour without tips depending on where they live and the industry they work in. The minimum wage for everyone else varies between $10.40 and $13.50 based on location and industry. Tips are meant to make up the difference between what tipped workers earn and the statewide minimum wage. Employers have to fill the gap if tips do not. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo believes the proposal may help employees who struggle to make the minimum wage with tips. If the Department of Labor agrees, the agency can raise the minimum wage for tipped employees without approval from voters or the state legislature. They already did once in 2015. What happened in Maine Maine tried to do the same thing in 2016 — sort of. In a 2016 ballot initiative, Maine approved increasing the state’s minimum wage as well as gradually raising the minimum wage for tipped workers until it reached $12 in 2024. The measure passed by a slim margin. By the time the new minimum wage took effect at the start of 2017, restaurant workers had already organized a campaign to restore the lower wage for tipped workers. They argued that a higher wage would give patrons less incentive to leave a tip. Fear became reality for many workers, according to Joshua Chaisson, a server in Portland, Maine, who co-founded Restaurant Workers of America to oppose the wage increase. ""Individuals were coming into our restaurant and simply asking us, ‘You make minimum wage, do you still think I should tip the same percentage?’ "" Chaisson said. He was one of hundreds of restaurant owners and workers who showed up at the state capitol in Maine that April for a public hearing on the wage increase.  ""Several of us had brought pay stubs forward from the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 showing we had actually lost money in the same identical quarter from year to year,"" Chaisson said. In June 2017, the Maine legislature passed a new law making the minimum wage for tipped workers half of the regular minimum wage. One of the bill's sponsors, Sen. Roger Katz, gave credit to restaurant workers for the new law.  ""Hundreds of restaurant workers have spoken, and we have listened,"" Katz said in a statement. ""Over the session it has become abundantly clear that those working in the restaurant industry overwhelmingly favor the tip credit system."" Our ruling Tedisco said the measure raising the minimum wage for tipped workers in Maine was reversed in less than a year. Tedisco is right. Voters in Maine raised the minimum wage for tipped workers through a ballot initiative. State lawmakers reversed that decision less than a year later after pressure from restaurant workers who were against the wage increase. We rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB82B80>],/factchecks/2018/apr/26/james-tedisco/ny-may-raise-wages-tipped-workers-heres-what-happe/

Donald Trump says people who went to school with Obama never saw him
","
Donald Trump began a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 10, 2011, by announcing that he is ""thinking about"" running for president. Too often, Trump said, successful people don't run for president because they don't want to be ""scrutinized or abused."" As a result, he said, we get presidents like Barack Obama.

""Our current president came out of nowhere. Came out of nowhere,"" Trump said. ""In fact, I'll go a step further: the people that went to school with him, they never saw him, they don't know who he is. It's crazy.""

The line drew big applause from the conservative audience. We tried unsuccessfully to reach Trump to see if he was suggesting that Obama led an unremarkable life during his school years, or if it was a wink to the conservative legions who are not convinced that Obama is a natural-born American citizen.

In any case, Trump's comment harkens back to an attack line that dogged Obama throughout the 2008 presidential campaign -- that he had a shady background that didn't add up.

First, we'll set the stage with a brief outline of Obama's academic career. Obama began his schooling in Indonesia (where his mother and step-father had moved from Hawaii), attending Besuki Public School and St. Francis of Assisi School, both in Jakarta, from ages 6 to 10. Obama then returned to Honolulu, Hawaii, to live with his maternal grandparents and attended Punahou School, a private college preparatory school, through high school. Obama began his college career at Occidental College in California in 1979. After two years, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City, where he studied political science and graduated with a B.A. in 1983. Obama later went to, and graduated from, Harvard Law School.

We'll start in the middle of Obama's post-secondary education, his two years at Columbia, because that has been the nexus of previous ""None-of-his-classmates-knew-him"" claims. As Snopes.com points out in an October 2009 article debunking the claim, it appears to have roots in two sources. The first is a 2008 Wall Street Journal editorial about ""Obama's Lost Years"" at Columbia which states, ""Fox News contacted some 400 of his classmates and found no one who remembered him."" About the same time, Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee Wayne Allen Root -- who attended Columbia at the same time as Barack Obama -- told Reason: ""I think the most dangerous thing you should know about Barack Obama is that I don't know a single person at Columbia that knows him, and they all know me. I don't have a classmate who ever knew Barack Obama at Columbia. Ever!""

In a 2005 interview in an alumni magazine, Columbia College Today, Obama said that while at Columbia he was somewhat involved with the Black Students Organization and participated in anti-apartheid activities, but otherwise kept a fairly low profile.

""Mostly, my years at Columbia were an intense period of study,"" said Obama, who lived off campus. ""When I transferred, I decided to buckle down and get serious. I spent a lot of time in the library. I didn’t socialize that much. I was like a monk.""

So he wasn't BMOC. But he wasn't entirely invisible either.

A May 15, 2008, story by the Associated Press, ""Old friends recall Obama's years in LA, NY,"" quotes the recollections of an old roommate of Obama's in New York, Sohale Siddiqi.

And former roommate and friend, Phil Boerner, has shared his recollections of Obama's time at Columbia with several reporters and is quoted in David Remnick's Obama's biography, The Bridge. The New York Times did an extensive interview with Boerner for a Jan. 20, 2009, story.

And Politico posted online an article Obama wrote for Columbia's weekly magazine, The Sundial, which ran under the headline, ""Breaking the War Mentality"" on March 10, 1983.

After FactCheck.org ran a story about the Columbia classmate's claim, another former classmate e-mailed to say she, too, remembered Obama.

So we called her.

Cathie Currie, who currently teaches social psychology at Adelphi University, recalled Obama joining her group occasionally to play pick-up soccer games on the lawn outside the library. She was a graduate student at the time, and Obama was an undergrad.

He was a good soccer player, she said, even though basketball was his primary athletic passion. Obama also made an impression with his maturity and wisdom, she said. He talked about things like government for all the people, she said. In fact, Currie assumed because of Obama's heady conversation that he was a graduate student as well.

Currie isn't surprised that he was not widely-remembered by fellow Columbia classmates. ""My sense of it was that he was keeping a low profile,"" Currie said.

He seemed like someone who had made a decision to prioritize his studies, she said. ""We'd ask him to go out with us for beers after soccer,"" she said. ""He seemed like he wanted to, but then he'd step back and say, 'Sorry, I'm going to the library.'""

We're not going to spend too much time on Obama's time at Occidental and Harvard Law. Dozens of former classmates and teachers from those schools have publicly shared their recollections (and photos) of Obama. Obama was the president of the prestigious Harvard Law Review journal, for goodness sake.

But here's a few stories chock full of classmates' recollections:

New York Times, ""In Law School, Obama Found Political Voice.""

Boston Globe, ""At Harvard Law, a unifying voice: Classmates recall Obama as even-handed leader.""

The Weekly Standard, ""The Real Obama."" For this story, reporter Dean Barnett contacted dozens of Obama's classmates at Harvard Law School. ""Also noteworthy is that virtually everyone seemed to know Obama,"" Bartnett wrote.

YouTube.com even has this video of classmate Hill Harper talking about Obama.

In fact, many of Obama's former classmates volunteered for his presidential campaign, and Politico ran a story about some 20 Harvard classmates who were members of his transition team. The story ran under the headline ""School buds: 20 Harvard classmates advising Obama.""

As for Occidental, lots of former classmates and teachers have come forward to talk about the Obama they remember from his two years on campus there. For example, see the Los Angeles Times' Jan. 29, 2007, story, ""Occidental recalls 'Barry' Obama.""

Trump casts a wide net with the statement ""people that went to school with him."" So we did a little digging to see whether there have been any classmates from elementary and high school who recall Obama.

Plenty.

A comprehensive story on Obama's childhood by the Chicago Tribune should put this to rest. By our count, it names -- and quotes -- more than a dozen former classmates and teachers from Obama's youth.

Among those quoted are two students from each of the two schools Obama attended in Indonesia, as well as several of Obama's grade school teachers. They related stories of how Obama was teased because of his race, how he struggled with learning the Indonesian language, how he drew cartoons and even wrote an essay about how he wanted to be president one day.

The story also quotes several classmates and teachers at Punahou School in Hawaii, a private school Obama attended in Hawaii through high school. Among them are some of Obama's closest childhood friends, as well as teachers. In his senior year, Obama's basketball team (he was not a starter) won a state championship in 1979. The Chicago Tribune notes that Obama was nicknamed ""Barry O'Bomber"" by teammates due to his accuracy on long jump shots.

David Remnick's Obama biography The Bridge is sprinkled with quotes from former classmates and teachers of Obama in elementary and high school.

We could get deeper into this but it seems like overkill. It's abundantly clear that there are lots and lots of former classmates who remember Obama at every level of school. It's true that Obama's two years at Columbia are relatively undocumented. And far fewer classmates have publicly shared recollections of Obama from that period, as opposed to other school years before and after. At Columbia, Obama was a transfer student, he lived off campus and by his and other accounts he buried himself in his studies and didn't socialize much. But even so, there are several students who recall Obama at Columbia.

In short, media accounts and biographies are filled with on-the-record, named classmates who remember Obama. Trump is certainly right that presidential candidates are heavily scrutinized. As even a basic online search confirms, Obama's school years were, too. Trump's claim that people who went to school with Obama ""never saw him, they don't know who he is"" is ridiculous. Or, to borrow Trump's phrase, it's crazy. We rule Trump's statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC39440>],/factchecks/2011/feb/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-people-who-went-school-obama-nev/

Doonesbury strip says 270,000 Americans have been killed by guns since 9/11
","
In the Sunday, Feb. 13, 2011, installment of the comic strip Doonesbury, Mark Slackmeyer -- a longtime character in the strip who is a liberal radio host -- makes a point about gun violence.

""What are we like as a people?"" Slackmeyer muses to himself in his studio. ""Nine years, ago we were attacked -- 3,000 people died. In response, we started two long, bloody wars and built a vast homeland-security apparatus -- all at a cost of trillions! Now consider this. During those same nine years, 270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home. Our response? We weakened our gun laws.""

At that point, a whirring sound comes from off-panel. In the final panel, we see that his guest is a space alien, who says, ""Fail. Cannot Comprehend."" To which Slackmeyer cracks, ""Well, you may be a little jet-lagged.""

A reader asked us to fact-check it. So we’ll look at whether since Sept. 11, 2001, ""270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home.""

We began by contacting Garry Trudeau, the cartoonist who has drawn Doonesbury for more than four decades. He got back immediately with a summary of his methodology.

""The final figure lacks precision, because it's extrapolated,"" Trudeau wrote us, noting, correctly, that the most recent data for gun deaths from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is from 2007. 
""What I had were six years -- 2002-2007 -- of a remarkably stable number, around 30,000"" gun deaths per year, Trudeau wrote. ""So in my judgment, multiplying 30,000 times nine yielded a figure reasonable and accurate enough for rhetorical purposes without using hyperbole. If anything, it may be slightly on the low side."" 
We found that Trudeau was basically right. We went to the same CDC database he used -- the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (or WISQARS for short) -- and got virtually identical numbers. Our number came out slightly higher -- 281,757 -- because we not only extrapolated out through the end of 2010 in our calculations but also included the final three months of 2001.

We should note the details of Trudeau’s definition of gun deaths, which is also the definition we would have used if we’d been starting from scratch. It includes the following categories:

• Suicides: 102,002 between 2002 and 2007
• Homicides: 73,148 between 2002 and 2007
• Accidental: 4,185 between 2002 and 2007
• Legal shootings: 1,999 between 2002 and 2007
• Undetermined: 1,427 between 2002 and 2007

-- Total: 182,761 between 2002 and 2007

So on the numbers, Trudeau’s methodology was accurate.

The only thing that threw us was how the strip had described where the deaths occurred -- ""270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home"" (our emphasis).

Initially, we took that to mean that 270,000 Americans were literally killed in or near their homes. And we knew that couldn’t be right, because the number both we and Trudeau calculated included all gunfire deaths, wherever they had occurred.

When we asked criminologists for guidance on what percentage of gun deaths occur at home, they said the statistics on that question are scattershot. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, provided data on Chicago homicides from an amicus brief he wrote for a Supreme Court case. Since 1965, the ratio of outside-the-home handgun homicides in Chicago to those occurring at home has tended to bounce around from about two-to-one in the 1970s to about five-to-one in the 1990s.

So if one interprets ""at home"" to mean in or near someone’s home, the numbers Trudeau calculated wouldn’t be correct.

When we raised this point with Trudeau, he said that wasn’t what he meant: ""I didn't say ‘in the home,’ I said ‘at home’ as opposed to abroad, where the wars are. Failure to communicate clearly, I guess. Rats.""

Reading through it again, we think Trudeau’s explanation sounds reasonable. But we decided to mark Trudeau down slightly because we think it’s also reasonable for people to make the same initial assumption we did, that ""at home"" means in or near one’s home. So we’ll rate the comment Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB3F4C0>],/factchecks/2011/feb/14/doonesbury/doonesbury-strip-says-270000-americans-have-been-k/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Pundits', 'Cenk Uygur']","
Hatch once supported an individual mandate, said Cenk Uygur
","With Keith Olbermann's recent departure from MSNBC, the cable news channel has re-shuffled its liberal talk show hosts and added a new pundit, Cenk Uygur (pronounced Jenk You-grr).

Uygur recently ripped Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, for courting the tea party movement. First, Uygur showed video of Hatch saying that he, like the tea party, was opposed to the health care law.

""I was the one who raised the issue about the job-killing employer mandate, and of course the unconstitutional employee mandate,"" Hatch said. ""I've been all over the world for our country. Everywhere we go, people have always been amazed by America. And yet, we're in danger of losing the greatest country in the world. So we've got to fight back.""

""Here's what I'm amazed by -- Orrin Hatch,"" Uygur said. ""You're going to tell me you're tea party? There's no one who's more Republican establishment than Orrin Hatch, who's been there for approximately 800 years. ... By the way, did you hear him putting dirt on the mandate? He said, oh, I can't put a mandate. I'm totally against that. Did you know that Hatch co-sponsored the 1993 bill that had an individual mandate? ... It's unbelievable.""

We knew Uygur was joking about Hatch serving in the Senate for 800 years. (Hatch was elected in 1976, not 1210.) But we were interested in Uygur's comment that Hatch had once sponsored a health care bill that included an individual mandate. We wondered if that were actually the case, so we decided to check it out.

Our search took us back to the health care debates of the early 1990s, when President Bill Clinton tried to shepherd through a national health care plan with help from First Lady Hillary Clinton. The Clinton plan required employers to pay for insurance and then closely regulated both insurers and health care providers through cost controls and purchasing groups.

To counter that, the late Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., introduced a plan that avoided the employer mandate and cost controls. Chafee's plan, one of several Republican alternatives, created a universal tax deduction for health insurance and gave the poor vouchers to buy policies. It also required everyone to buy insurance -- an individual mandate.

Chafee's plan was backed by a group of Republican senators, including Hatch, according to news reports from the time. When the plan was formally introduced as legislation, Hatch was one of the co-sponsors. Two other current senators also co-sponsored the plan: Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.

We examined the old legislation, which we found in the THOMAS legislative database. The individual mandate in that proposal appears to work the same as the mandate in the new law. The main difference is how the fines work for those who don't buy insurance. The new law sets a dollar amount; the older proposal set the fee at 120 percent of average premium limits, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

We contacted Hatch's office to ask for an explanation for Hatch's change of position, but we didn't hear back. Last year, Kaiser Health News interviewed former Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., who had also co-sponsored the plan. Durenberger said that it was Republicans who had changed in the years since 1993, backing away from policies on health care they once supported.

Uygur asked, ""Did you know that Hatch co-sponsored the 1993 bill that had an individual mandate?"" We didn't, but we checked the record. Hatch was the co-sponsor of a Republican-backed bill that included an individual mandate. We rate Uygur's statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE10D40>],/factchecks/2011/feb/14/cenk-uygur/hatch-once-supported-individual-mandate-said-cenk-/

Rick Scott says health care law is biggest tax increase in U.S. history
","
Florida Gov. Rick Scott's new job isn't getting in the way of his old hobby -- criticizing the federal health care law.

Scott, who in 2009 formed Conservatives for Patients' Rights to oppose health care reforms being proposed by President Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress, has continued to fight the health care reforms from his new perch as governor of Florida.

The multimillionaire former hospital chain CEO promises to support lawsuits seeking to declare the law unconstitutional, and on Feb. 3, 2011, called on Obama to repeal the tax provisions of the health care law. In a speech to tout the release of his first state budget, Scott challenged Obama to repeal or roll back taxes and fees increased to help pay for the increased coverage the health care seeks to provide. Scott said Obama should follow Florida's lead -- where Scott was planning to cut state school property taxes and the corporate income tax.

The federal health care law is ""a massive tax increase, probably the biggest tax increase ever in the history of our country,"" Scott told about 100 Chromalloy employees during a tour of their aerospace manufacturing plant in Tampa. ""Those tax increases, they are taking money out of your pocket. They are taking money out of your company's pocket. They are taxing things that you buy. All that is taking money out of our economy and throwing more money at the federal government, which makes no sense.""

Scott spent more than a year fighting the passage of the health care bill, so he certainly knows the legislation. But does he have the line right about being the ""biggest tax increase ever?""

The health care law certainly is, on the whole, a tax increase.

Major tax provisions 
The federal Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants, provided members a detailed breakdown of tax impact from 2010-2019.

• Starting in 2013, Medicare payroll taxes increase 0.9 percentage points for people with incomes over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly). Also, people at this income level would pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. The 10-year cost: $210.2 billion.

• Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called ""Cadillac plans"" (over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families), kicks in. That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019.

• Starting in 2011, there's a new fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers. That's expected to raise $27 billion over 10 years.

• Starting in 2013, a 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices starts. The 10-year total: $20 billion.

• Starting in 2014, a new annual fee on health insurance providers begins. Total estimated 10-year revenue: $60.1 billion.

• Starting in 2013, the floor on medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns will be raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income. That's expected to bring in $15.2 billion over the next 10 years.

• Starting in 2011, a 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. That's expected to bring in $2.7 billion over the next 10 years. 
There also is money in the law going the other way. The plan includes government money, in the form of tax credits, to subsidize the cost of health insurance for lower-income people who don't get insurance through their employer. For the record, many Republicans and tax experts argue those shouldn't count as tax cuts. And there is a tax cut for some very small businesses that allows them to write off a portion of the cost of providing insurance to their employees.

Combined with various other revenue-generating provisions, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the health law will bring in more than $437.8 billion by 2019. The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the additional revenues coming in to the government to be $525 billion between now and 2019.

Does that translate to the biggest tax increase in American history?

Comparing tax impacts of legislation

First, we need to set some goal posts. There are many ways to define or measure the size of a tax increase, and not all tax increases have been measured the same way over time. The health care tax provisions, for instance, take effect between 2011 and 2018, meaning the full effect of the legislation won't be felt until near the end of the decade. On top of that, it doesn't make sense to compare 2019 dollars to 1985 dollars. You have to adjust for inflation, or express the amount as a total of Gross Domestic Product at the time, which is a way to measure the relative impact of a tax provision at the time it was enacted.

To make matters even more complicated, there are tax cuts that are direct results of tax increases, and vice-versa. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), for example, was passed largely to reverse revenue losses from the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA).

For our comparison, we used a method perfected by Jerry Tempalski, an analyst in the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In 2006, Tempalski tried to determine the relative impact of major tax revenue bills from 1940-2006. He used revenue estimates from Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation and calculated the impact as a percentage of GDP.

For 1940-1967 calculations, he used a single-year snapshot of the revenue impact of the tax legislation. For more recent tax bills, from 1968-2006, Tempalski used a two-year average of the revenue effects. Tempalski wrote: ""The comparison of tax bills for the first period should be examined with some caution, because the revenue estimates are from different sources and are not completely consistent. The comparison for the second period can be viewed with more confidence, because the estimates are relatively consistent.""

As a percent of GDP, here are the top five tax increases from 1940-2006, according to Tempalski:

1. Revenue Act of 1942: 5.04 percent of GDP;

2. Revenue Act of 1961: 2.2 percent of GDP;

3. Current Tax Payment Act of 1943: 1.13 percent of GDP;

4. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP;

5. Excess Profits Tax of 1950: .97 percent of GDP;

And here are the top five tax increases from the ""modern"" era of 1968-2006:

1. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP;

2. Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982: .8 percent of GDP;

3(t): Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980: .5 percent of GDP

3(t): Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993; .5 percent of GDP;

5: Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990; .49 percent of GDP.

The 2010 health care law

The list obviously does not include the health care law, which passed in 2010, and a spokeswoman for the Department of Treasury says it hasn't been updated. So we calculated our own percent of GDP figure. We used 2019 as our baseline because that's when all of the tax provisions of the law will be in effect. In 2019, the CBO estimates, the government will see increased revenues of $104 billion. We then divided that number into the projected GDP for 2019, which according to the CBO economic forecast is $21.164 trillion. That would mean the tax increase provisions of the health care law would amount to .49 percent of total GDP.

Depending on your rounding, that would mean the tax increases resulting from the health care law would be about the size of tax cuts proposed and passed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter, in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush and in 1993 by President Bill Clinton.

The health care-related tax increases are smaller than the tax increase signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1982 and a temporary tax signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. And they are significantly smaller than two tax increases passed during World War II and a tax increase passed in 1961.

The tax increases in the health care legislation do reverse a trend of federal tax cuts and represents the first significant tax increases since 1993. But for Scott to suggest they are the largest in U.S. history is inaccurate. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB57AC0>],/factchecks/2011/feb/14/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-health-care-bill-biggest-tax-incre/
"['Energy', 'Virginia', 'Jim Webb']","
Sen. Jim Webb says Iraq war is major reason for oil price increases
","
Jim Webb campaigned for Senate in 2006 in strong opposition to the war in Iraq, always wearing his deployed son’s combat boots.

The Democrat, who announced Feb. 9 that he would not run for re-election, recently discussed the war and its impact on oil prices while questioning James Jeffrey, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq.

""We were worried, and were saying so at the time, that this endeavor would harm the country's economy--that it would blow the top off the price of oil,"" Webb said during a Feb. 3 hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""I recall when the Congress voted to go to war in Iraq, oil was $24 a barrel.  It went up to $143. Today, it's about $102.""

Each trip to the gas pump in recent months has been a stark reminder that oil is more expensive than it used to be. We wondered if the U.S. invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq was a major factor in blowing ""the top off the price of oil.""

Congress authorized President George W. Bush to use force against Iraq on October 11, 2002. On that day, the spot price for a barrel of European Brent crude oil was $28.18, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude was $29.36 per barrel that day, according to the EIA.

We are relying on the spot price, which refers to the price a trader would pay for an immediate settlement of a trade, rather than prices from futures contracts -- another widely-used method of purchasing oil -- because the EIA keeps exhaustive spot price archives.

During November 2002 the spot price of Brent crude fell to and below the $24 per barrel threshold mentioned by Webb. It bottomed at $22.82 on Nov. 14, 2002. WTI crude fell to $25.28 the same week.

Brent prices fluctuated above and below $30 per barrel in early 2003, hitting $34.16 the week before the U.S. invasion but falling to $28.00 on March 20, the day U.S. forces began their assault on Iraq.

Brent went below $24 per barrel at the end of April 2003 and stayed below $40 until July 2004. Costs trended higher through the rest of 2004 and into 2005, raising up to $66 per barrel. Prices reached as high as $78 per in August 2006, but it wasn’t until the summer and fall of 2007 that oil really took off.

The $80 per barrel threshold was breached in September 2007, and in November of that year prices for Brent crude moved above $90. The closing price hit $100  on Feb. 29, 2008.

Most of us remember the spring and summer that followed. Crude prices soared higher, and tabs at the pump followed. Brent peaked at $143.95 on July 3, 2008. Two weeks later the price was down to $129.34, and by early-December, as the global economy spiraled deep into a severe recession, prices dived below $40 per barrel. They’ve been climbing since the start of 2009, and Brent nudged above the $100 mark on Feb. 1 as protests in Egypt continued to build.

So how does Iraq fit in to this roller coaster?

Webb’s comments on oil prices closely mirror those of Joseph Stiglitz, a Columbia University economist and Nobel Prize winner. In a September 2010 op-ed for The Washington Post, Stiglitz and co-author Linda Bilmes noted the increase in oil prices during the past several years. They wrote that ""not only was Iraqi production interrupted, but the instability the war brought to the Middle East dampened investment in the region.""

The two said the ""war’s impact on prices works out to at least $10 per barrel,"" an estimate they called ""still conservative,"" but up from their 2008 appraisal of a $5 per barrel increase caused by the war.

We spoke to David Kreutzer, a research fellow in energy economics and climate change at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to ask what drove oil prices so high in recent years.

""It is all about supply in the long run,"" he said. ""The war shut down what production Iraq had in the first place and raised shipping costs in the [Persian] Gulf over the short term. But in the long run Iraq is a factor only to the extent it was not producing as high as it could. The insurgency did attack pipelines but growing demand from China and India were the key story.""

According to the EIA, China used 4.9 million barrels of oil a day in 2001. In 2009, the last year for which data is available, it consumed 8.3 million barrels a day. India’s daily consumption during that time went from 2.2 million barrels to 3.1 million. Global demand went from 77.8 million barrels a day to a peak of 86.0 million in 2007. During 2009 the world used  84.4 million barrels a day. Of that, the United States consumed 18.8 million barrels.  

In 2001 Iraq was the world’s 12th-largest oil producer, pumping out 2.4 million barrels a day, according to EIA data. That fell to 1.3 million barrels per day in 2003 and hovered near 2.0 million barrels per day from 2004 through 2006. Only in 2008 and 2009 did the country return to its 2001 production levels.

The EIA says Iraq has the world’s fourth-largest proven petroleum reserves, trailing Saudi Arabia, Canada and Iran. The group also says ""Iraq may be one of the few places left where vast reserves, proven and unknown, have barely been exploited.""

Charles Ebinger, the director of the Energy Security Initiative at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, said rising demand goes beyond China and India, and beyond instability in Iraq.

""There is no doubt that the Iraq crisis led to near-term upward movement of prices, particularly after invasion,"" he said. ""But the far more dynamic pressure has been rising demand in Asia. China of course, but also Indonesia, Thailand and Pakistan, even Bangladesh.""

These price increases also came at a time when the global economy was booming, Ebinger noted. The Dow Jones Industrial average peaked above 14,000 in October 2007 and was still above 12,000 as late as June 2008.

""The perception was it would continue driving commodity prices up,"" he said. ""China was taking lots and lots of commodities and that was having a psychological impact on the markets as well.""

So where does that leave us on Webb’s claim that the war in Iraq helped ""blow the top off the price of oil?""

The government’s energy data collection unit tracked a sharp decrease in Iraqi oil production during the aftermath of the U.S. invasion. And two experts on oil production said the war had a short-term impact on prices. But both also said higher demand in China and other emerging economies, along with a surging global economy before the 2008 recession, were far more important factors.

Global demand for oil has increased by 7.6 million barrels a day over the last decade -- more than three time Iraq’s peak output during that period.

Webb is correct that the Invasion of Iraq had an effect on oil prices, especially immediately after the invasion. But rising demand from China and other developing nations played a far more important role over the course of the past eight years. We find his statement is Barely True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB76880>],/factchecks/2011/feb/14/jim-webb/sen-jim-webb-says-iraq-war-major-reason-oil-price-/
"['Candidate Biography', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Chris Abele']","
Milwaukee County executive candidate Chris Abele says opponent Jeff Stone = Scott Walker
","
A doppelganger is a ghostly double of a living person. In German it means ""double walker.""

In the case of a new TV ad from Milwaukee County executive candidate Chris Abele, it would be ""double Scott Walker.""

Naturally, state Rep. Jeff Stone -- Abele’s opponent in the April 5 election -- is the alleged double.

In a new TV ad with B-movie special effects, Abele presents Stone and the new Republican governor as scary, bleached-out phantoms in ideological lockstep on the ""unfair"" state budget repair law. Stone, the ad claims, will copy a Walker agenda that has ""mismanaged"" Milwaukee County government.

""I thought he was Scott Walker’s twin,"" a man identified as David Crowley of Milwaukee County says into the camera. Later, he adds: ""Jeff Stone is Scott Walker.""

Last fall in the governor’s race, we looked at the Republican primary ad Scott Walker used to equate opponent Mark Neumann with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. We labeled Walker’s claim -- ""Mark Neumann = Nancy Pelosi,"" for shorthand -- and found it False.

Here, Abele’s ad essentially equates Stone with Walker.

So: Does Stone = Walker?

Of course, depending on where a voter sits, the degree of similarity could be considered a good thing or a bad thing.

But it’s worth evaluating, because both sides have made Stone’s ties to Walker a theme -- Stone ran as Walker’s logical successor for most of the race, and Abele is now pointing that out in a negative sense.

We asked the Abele campaign to back up the claim. They provided an analysis of voting records and pointed us to public statements and other evidence.

""They are overwhelmingly similar, and Jeff would represent a continuation of Scott Walker’s approach to governing,"" said Brandon Lorenz, Abele’s spokesman.

We’ll look at Walker and Stones’ statements about each other, as well as their voting histories, common causes, priorities, styles and backgrounds.

Walker and Stone have been linked closely because both are conservative Republicans from suburban Milwaukee communities who scored rare victories to succeed Democrats in office. They served in the Legislature together for about four years -- even carpooling together -- with Walker taking the higher profile.

Walker is seven years younger, at 43, but they got into elected politics within a year of each other. Stone started locally, as a Greenfield city alderman. Walker, from Wauwatosa, won a state Assembly seat.

Both considered the Milwaukee County exec’s job in 2002 after a pension scandal forced out F. Thomas Ament; only Walker jumped in. Stone helped Walker get elected. Now Stone wants to take over for Walker, and the governor says Stone -- whom he has endorsed and raised campaign money for -- would be a crucial local ally in reducing spending.

Stone and Walker’s statements:

Walker touted Stone in February 2010 as a worthy successor, saying he was ""interested in pursuing some of the same reforms and ideas"" that Walker has backed. That confirmed the impression at the Courthouse, dating back years, that Stone was the GOP’s candidate in waiting.

Stone has consistently praised Walker.

It should be noted though that from the start of his campaign he has said that his small-business experience would make him more focused on job creation than Walker, who Stone said was focused primarily on reforming county government after the pension scandal.

Are they close ideologically and by temperament?

Stone said in March 2011 that he and Walker share ""similar aspirations"" and ""a similarity in how we go about things. He urged a conservative audience: ""Vote for the person who’s going to move Milwaukee County forward along the lines of what Scott Walker has.""

Stone’s pre-primary campaign literature implored voters to back him to preserve gains being made during Walker’s tenure.

At times since Walker’s budget attracted massive protests in Madison this winter, Stone cautiously has tried to separate himself. He has said he will be less confrontational.

""I voted for the budget, but I'm not Scott Walker,"" said Stone. ""I'm Jeff Stone. I have a very different way of managing and doing business.""

Stone voted for Walker’s controversial budget-repair law, but later signaled he would not have tried to sharply curtail union bargaining rights if it had been up to him -- a position that earned him a Half Flip.

He voted for the business tax cuts Walker pushed in January’s special session.

Common Assembly voting history:

Stone and Walker overlapped in the Assembly from 1998 to 2002, when Walker was elected county executive. Stone has operated closer to power during his legislative career than did Walker (1993-2002). Stone served on the Legislature’s  budget-writing Joint Finance Committee. Walker made his mark mostly on law enforcement issues.

Research by Abele’s camp on more than 1,400 common votes shows Stone and Walker agreed 96 percent of the time. Stone doesn’t dispute that number.

There’s a limit, though, to how much insight comes from examining a mass of votes by two members of the same party, because most lawmakers vote the party line most of the time, and so many votes are minor.

So we looked at some ratings by a sampling of special interest groups on key legislation. The verdict: Stone and Walker have remarkably similar profiles, though not identical ones. 
Top priorities:

On the issues, Stone has adopted Walker’s signature anti-tax stance and similarly endorses smaller government. Stone and Walker jointly have proposed various tax cuts over the years. Like Walker, Stone has long been an active supporter of a photo ID requirement for voting.

The most notable difference: public transit.

Walker has been cool to expanding public transit for years, while Stone has made a regional transportation approach his signature issue.

""He’s been a great transit advocate for a decade,"" Kerry Thomas, interim executive director of Transit Now, a southeastern Wisconsin advocacy group, said of Stone.

There are limits to Stone’s support of new transportation options; he has spurned light rail, and he agreed with Walker’s stance against federal help for a high-speed train.

But Stone was a leading force behind creation of the Regional Transit Authority focused on commuter rail, and he has backed buses, and some -- but by no means all -- proposals for new funding options for public transit. Walker has taken a much tougher line against transit and new taxes or fees to pay for it. Stone is pledging an end to bus cuts seen under Walker and Ament.

Stone, like Walker, has backed freeway expansion.

Experience:

Stone emphatically says he is his own person and is going to ""do it my way.""

We asked him for examples of where he has broken with Walker -- and how his voting record compares.

He offered no criticism of Walker and pointed to no particular votes where they parted. But he notes correctly that he’s made a priority of regional transit, in contrast to Walker.

Their biggest difference, Stone said, is ""vastly different life experiences and what we’ve done in our career."" Stone has run a small printing company, while Walker worked briefly in the private sector before winning election.

He suggests that he will be more pragmatic and collegial than Walker.

""I have a very different way of managing and doing business that Scott Walker,"" he said at a candidate forum.

Stone has made a point of saying he will try to get along with the County Board and work with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

Let’s review.

Abele’s strongest evidence comes from Stone himself, who has aligned himself closely with Walker’s agenda and politics. Their voting histories are very similar, and they win very similar ratings from interest groups.

They are not indistinguishable, though: The transit issue illustrates Stone’s willingness to step out from Republican orthodoxy and work behind the scenes in a bipartisan fashion -- neither of which are Walker trademarks. Stone’s business experience is a notable biographical difference.

In the end, Abele’s equation (Stone = Walker) scores out as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9B2340>],/factchecks/2011/mar/30/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-chris-abele-s/

Texas group says over 8,000 gay couples raising children in Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio
","
A Texas group promoting plans by gay couples to seek marriage licenses on Valentine’s Day issued a Feb. 9 press release suggesting it speaks for many urban parents. ""Between Austin, San Antonio, Houston and Dallas over 8,000 same-sex couples are raising children,"" said Michael Diviesti, state coordinator of GetEQUAL TX, part of a self-described national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights group advocating legal and social equality.

Says who?

In response to our query, Diviesti told us most of his parental count was drawn from reported research by Gary Gates, a scholar at the University of California-Los Angeles. He pointed us to a Jan. 25 article on Gates’ work in the Dallas Voice, a gay-oriented newspaper, featuring a chart stating there are 3,178 gay couples raising children in Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, 2,458 in Houston-Sugarland-Baytown and 1,180 in San Antonio-New Braunfels, accounting for 6,816 couples in those metropolitan statisical areas. The chart doesn’t specify what year it covers nor the number of gay couples raising children in the Austin area.

The article says the study was highlighted in a New York Times news article. That story, published Jan. 18, quotes Gates saying that survey data gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau indicates there were about 581,000 same-sex couples in the United States in 2009.

The Times’ story says Gates has concluded that child rearing among same-sex couples is more common in the South than in any other region of the country and that gay couples in states such as Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas are more likely to be raising children than their counterparts on the West Coast, in New York and in New England.

One factor, the story says, is that a large number of gay couples, possibly a majority, previously had children with partners in heterosexual relationships.

Some 34 percent of same-sex couples in San Antonio are raising children, Gates is quoted saying, placing the city No. 1 nationally.

Separately, Diviesti also noted a January 2008 online post by the Williams Institute, a UCLA School of Law think tank that says it advances sexual orientation law and public policy through independent research. The post states that according to census data, some 20 percent--or 10,000--of almost 50,000 same-sex couples in Texas were raising children as of 2005. The same year, the post says, an estimated 17,444 of Texas’s children were living in households headed by same-sex couples.

In response to our inquiry about how many gay couples are raising children in Austin, Diviesti said that in compiling numbers for the press release, he mistakenly used a 2000 census figure for same-sex couples in Travis County--2,984--for his Austin number.""I was in a rush to find the statistic,"" Diviesti said. He said his error probably makes his figure of more than 8,000 about 1,000 too high.

Next, we contacted Gates, who said the information in the Times’ story came from his analysis of annual census survey numbers. Gates added via e-mail: ""These are not statistics that the Census Bureau provides on its public website. Instead, they are my own analyses of Public Use Microdata Samples that are made available each year. The analyses combine data from 2005-2009 in order to get sufficient samples sizes of the same-sex couples.""

Gates told us his latest review suggests there are 945 same-sex couples raising children in the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos metropolitan statistical area. We added that to his reported estimates of same-sex couples raising children in the three other Texas areas, and got 7,761.

We asked Gates if he did, or could, narrow his area-wide estimates to the cities singled out by the Texas group. He said he did not and that it would be difficult to do so. One factor that complicates the calculation: ""There likely is a meaningful difference as I believe that city residents (generally and among same-sex couples) are less likely to be raising children than suburban couples.""

All told, it appears that 7,761 same-sex couples--not more than 8,000--are raising children in metropolitan statistical areas that include Austin, San Antonio, Houston and Dallas. That total is even lower if referencing the cities alone, as the statement does, though by how much is hard to say.

We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACCF200>],/factchecks/2011/feb/14/get-equal-texas/get-equal-texas-says-over-8000-gay-couples-raising/
"['Oregon', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'Dan  Lucas']","
Did John Kitzhaber raid schools for human services?
","
Money for schools is always a hot topic, even more so as the Legislature starts tackling the budget for 2011-13. Earlier this month, Gov. John Kitzhaber released his proposal, including $5.558 billion for K-12 schools. That figure, charges former Oregon House candidate Dan Lucas in an online post, sacrifices schools for the Department of Human Services and the Oregon Health Authority.

""Governor’s proposed budget raids K-12 school funds to grow DHS again"" is the title of the piece, posted on the conservative-minded Oregon Catalyst. Lucas explains that Kitzhaber not only takes $225 million out of the State School Fund but that he gives the money to human services, which is growing by $333 million.  

Since the budget is set anew every two years, it’s hard to trace one agency’s growth to the demise of another. But we wanted to know if Lucas’s numbers were accurate. Is K-12 losing money from the previous two-year period? Is social services growing? How much is one to blame for the other?

Kitzhaber’s proposal calls for schools to get $5.558 billion of state general fund and lottery dollars. He proposes that human services -- which includes the fairly new Oregon Health Authority and the traditional Department of Human Services -- get $3.8 billion.

Naturally, we want to know, what do schools and social services receive now?

According to Oregon’s Budget and Management Division , the Legislature approved $5.782 billion for K-12 schools in 2009-11. A $1 billion revenue shortfall prompted two rounds of budget reductions in June and September of 2010, which dropped the K-12 figure to $5.38 billion. After add-backs, however, schools now are on track to receive $5.705 billion for the period that ends June 30. The governor’s proposal is indeed $225 million less than what was allocated originally, and about $147 million less than what was allocated for 2009-11 with reshuffling.

Let’s turn to social services. The Oregon Health Authority, which oversees health care, is scheduled to receive $1.74 billion of the $3.8 billion for human services. The Department of Human Services, which handles welfare, food stamps and protective services, will get the remaining $2.05 billion.

For 2009-11, the department is on track to receive $3.55 billion in state money. So human services, under the governor’s proposal, will receive $250 million more in state money in 2011-13 than in this period.

Now that the numbers are clear, can we say that K-12 shrank to grow Human Services? No, and here’s why: Lots of other areas were whittled in the governor’s proposed budget:
  
Community colleges: $473.6 million in 2009-11 (legislatively approved, general fund and lottery) and $445.5 million in 2011-13. Difference: Down $28.1 million.   
Oregon University System: $775 million in 2009-11 and $743.2 million in 2011-13. Difference: Down $31.8 million. 
Oregon Youth Authority: $265.2 million in 2009-11 and $231.7 million in 2011-13. Difference: Down $33.5 million. 

On the other hand, the Department of Corrections went from an allocated $1.252 billion this biennium to a recommended $1.404 billion in 2011-13. That’s a $152 million increase. You could argue that K-12 was cut to give more money to prisons.

But Linda Gilbert with the budget and management division says you can’t even say that -- because Kitzhaber did no pitting of agencies. ""He started them all at flat funding and then added revenue back to some. Addback decisions for each agency or program area were made in isolation. So, it would not be true to say that a shortfall in K-12 funding exists to fund corrections,"" she wrote.

Basically, Lucas has a problem with growing Human Services, and he wishes the state would do a better job making its case to the public as to why. He has a problem with the amount of money going to schools, as do House Democrats.

We give him credit for getting his numbers correct. But the direct line cause and effect just isn’t there. To say that the governor is ""raiding"" schools to fund human services contains just an element of truth -- K-12 going down, DHS going up -- and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

We rate the claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC99CAC0>],/factchecks/2011/feb/14/dan-lucas/did-john-kitzhaber-raid-schools-human-services/
"['Environment', 'Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Suder']","
Majority Leader Scott Suder says a letter from four Assembly Democrats “scored a death blow to northeast Wisconsin’s economy”
","
The potent combination of the Green Bay Packers, jobs and the great outdoors formed a fine kettle of fish in Madison.

The Journal Sentinel revealed Jan. 13, 2011, that outdoors retailer Bass Pro Shops was part of a development that businessman John Bergstrom was planning for a small piece of land near Lambeau Field in Green Bay.

That proposal, however, was hung up because part of the site had been designated a wetland. Environmental groups had raised objections, prompting an administrative review that could tack months onto the process.

As the Jan. 13 story noted, Gov. Scott Walker stepped in and had drafted an unusually specific piece of legislation that exempted the parcel from the environmental review.

As a vote neared, four Democratic members of the state Assembly sent a letter Jan. 26, 2011, to Bass Pro Shops founder Johnny Morris asking for a compromise on the project that would protect wetlands and the state’s fish population.

Two days later, Bass Pro Shops issued a short statement that said the company does not build stores on wetlands. A spokesman said the chain had held discussions with Bergstrom but said there was no deal.

All pretty straightforward.

Later that afternoon, Rep. Scott Suder (R-Abbotsford) let fly with two statements on the topic -- a news release and an e-mail blast.

The headline on the news release said ""Dems Kill Hundreds of Jobs in NE Wisconsin."" The release went on to say: ""Liberal Democrats in Madison scored a death blow to northeast Wisconsin's economy by winning a battle for the far left agenda.""

That gives a lot of credit to the out-of-power Democrats, who were using the old tactic of writing a letter -- and releasing it to the media -- to gain attention.

So, did the letter from the Dems scare off a national retail chain with 50 stores in 26 states?

We asked Suder for evidence that the company had made its decision -- essentially overnight -- in response to the letter.

""Certainly, the letter that was sent caused Bass Pro Shops to hesitate,"" Suder said, though he acknowledged he had no contact with the retailer about the matter.

Let’s fish out some details on the project: 
The author of the letter was state Rep. Brett Hulsey (D-Madison). He said he had met Morris -- the Bass Pro Shops founder -- years ago, when Hulsey worked for the Clinton administration.

""I could not imagine Johnny Morris and Bass Pro building on a wetlands because of the company’s core conservation principles,"" said Hulsey.

He said a Bass Pro Shops executive called him the day after the letter was sent and said the company was interested in Wisconsin but did not build on wetlands.

Despite the company’s position, the Legislature passed the bill exempting the parcel from the water quality review and Walker signed it Feb. 3, 2011.

Walker said that in the past the ""bureaucracy got in the way"" and his administration wanted to send the message: ""You can conserve and protect wetlands while having an economic project move forward.""

However, some believe the action will make the location less desirable, at least from a public relations point of view.

Said Hulsey: ""It’s been contaminated by this bill.""

Indeed, the fact wetlands were an issue may have had a special impact with Bass Pro Shops, which has no Wisconsin locations.

""For an outdoor retailer, that’s a more sensitive subject than for another one,"" said Neil Stern, senior partner with McMillan Doolittle, a company that advises retailers. His firm previously worked for Cabela’s, a Bass Pro Shops competitor.

""They want an arm’s length from any controversy,"" he said of Bass Pro Shops.

In its statement, Bass Pro Shops noted the company ""has a long and proud tradition of our conservation efforts and is a very conservation minded company. We have been recognized many times by conservation organizations across America for those conservation efforts. We were unaware of any wetlands issues and have not and will not be in favor of doing anything to harm wetlands wherever they might be.""

Let’s return to Suder’s statement, which said the letter by the Democrats torpedoed hundreds of jobs and was the death knell for the region’s economy.

That’s a huge overreach.

Had the store opened it would have created about 300 retail jobs. State records show that the Green Bay area in December had about 161,000 jobs. And the region is a much broader area than that.

OK, let’s pull this fish into the boat and see what we’ve got.

Suder charges that by sending a letter to Bass Pro Shops, four Democrats killed the project -- and with it, hundreds of jobs in Green Bay, dealing ""a death blow to northeast Wisconsin’s economy."" That’s one heck of a poison pen.

But there was no agreement between the developer and Bass Pro Shops and the wetlands objections had been raised by DNR staffers and environmentalists long before the Democratic lawmakers weighed in. Indeed, Walker and the Legislature were already moving to address the concerns about the wetlands issue slowing the project even before the letter. What’s more, the number of jobs in question -- welcome as they would be -- certainly doesn’t rate as a death blow to an entire region’s economy.

Suder’s pen is filled with red, flame-colored ink. Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC954DC0>],/factchecks/2011/feb/13/scott-suder/majority-leader-scott-suder-says-letter-four-assem/

Austin school district task force co-chair says 25 percent of the schools are ""underutilized""
","
Speaking to an Austin school task force’s exploration of possible Austin school closures, the volunteer group’s co-chair recently applauded alternative ideas yet warned that campus shutdowns aren’t off the table.

Janet Mitchell told the Austin American-Statesman for a Jan. 20 news article: ""The reality is that the (Austin school) district has a long-term inefficiency in utilization of school buildings. We have 25 percent of our school buildings that are underutilized. At some point... the community is going to need to decide whether we continue to invest in under-enrolled schools or whether we need to save those dollars to invest in teachers and programs.""

One in four schools--underused?

We left a message for Mitchell, then asked the school district for elaboration.

Joe Silva, assistant director for planning services, provided a spreadsheet listing each of the district’s 100-plus schools and whether each one is operating at, under or over the student capacity for which it was designed.

Silva said the district has historically considered a campus under-enrolled if its school buildings, not counting portables, are at 75 percent capacity or less. He said the citizens task force set an under-capacity threshold of 85 percent.

By the 85-percent threshold, 34 schools -- 31 percent -- are under-enrolled. By the usual district threshold, 22 schools -- 20 percent -- are under-filled. The calculations count both students who live in a school’s attendance zone and those attending via transfers.

According to the spreadsheet, the district’s least-crowded school is Pearce Middle School, at 31 percent of capacity. The school normally serves more students; sixth grade wasn’t offered this year. Also least-crowded, according to the spreadsheet, are Becker Elementary, at 40 percent, and Blackshear Elementary, at 41 percent.

Silva said that four of Becker’s permanent classrooms serve students shifted temporarily from their home schools to the disciplinary Alternative Center for Elementary Students. Those students aren’t counted in Becker’s enrollment calculation, he said, because the district can place the program at any location. Mary Saul, ACES’ director, told us that up to 36 students in the program occupy permanent classrooms at Becker.

Silva initially told us that the district would describe under-enrolled schools as under capacity, not underutilized. That is, he said, many schools not filled with students still use their available space to offer add-on programs for students, families and the community. Also, he said, the district’s central administration places administrative and other staff in space available in the schools.

He passed along campus survey results indicating that in 2009-10, 29 of the district’s 2,425 elementary classrooms, 1 percent, were used by principals for ""discretionary"" purposes, with others used for instruction, student and parental support or by district administrative staff.

""Very few campuses are underutilized,"" Silva said. ""But many are under capacity.""

Bumfuzzled? So were we, until Mitchell told us she’d said ""underutilized"" after seeing the term in a presentation to the school board.

The 15-page presentation, ""Facility Master Plan, Board Update,"" was shown to the board Jan. 10. It includes a page titled ""Current Facility Inefficiencies"" with this subhead: ""Utilization (Permanent Capacity/Enrollment)."" The page says the target utilization for the district is 85 percent to 105 percent; 27 schools -- or 25 percent -- are below the bottom target figure and 55 schools are above it. Silva later told us the results differ from the breakdown he gave us because the presentation used 2009-10 enrollment totals and ours had more recent enrollment totals.

So, 25 percent or so of the schools are below target capacity for students, but that’s not to say most of their space isn’t being used.

In fact, a key consultant on the master plan, Carolyn Staskiewicz, president of Ohio-based DeJong-Richter, told us in an interview that ""utilization"" -- a term reflecting the students enrolled in a school divided by the school’s capacity--could give the erroneous impression that the schools aren’t fully used.

At her suggestion, we poked into the term--underutilization--by contacting the Arizona-based Council on Educational Facility Planners International. Spokeswoman Barbara Worth pointed us to Ron Fanning, chairman of the board of Ohio-based Fanning/Howey Associates, Inc., among the nation’s largest school architecture firms. Fanning agreed with Staskiewicz’s definition of utilization, but said it’s not the only factor to weigh in judging a school’s value: ""You really have to look at each individual building"" on its merits, ""what it can hold, based on the programs being taught at that school... You can’t do a broad-brush statement.""

Stefan Pharis, who has a child at Barton Hills Elementary, told us the facilities task force has yet to take into account a comprehensive state measure of schools’ efficiency. According to online posts by the state comptroller’s office, the Financial Allocation Study for Texas (FAST), as ordered by the 2009 Legislature, reflects how districts and campuses spend their money -- and how the spending translates into student achievement.

""There’s an implication when you say (a school is) underutilized, that somehow they’re wasteful in terms of spending,"" Pharis said. According to the comptroller, he said, ""Some of these schools... excel academically and they do it at a cost-effective price.""

Our take: Mitchell’s statement accurately echoes the consultant-endorsed characterization of under-enrolled schools as being below their ""target"" utilization.

Mark Daniels says Oregon’s proposed paper bag fee is a tax
","
Opponents have raised a number of arguments to make their case against Senate Bill 536, which would ban plastic shopping bags and require retailers to charge a nickel per paper bag: It’s the elimination of choice at the checkout. It’s based on lies by the environmental community. And yes -- they went there -- it’s a tax on sacks.

At a public hearing, Mark Daniels, a vice president from Hilex Poly Co., said the proposal would force consumers to ""pay a tax on paper bags."" To that, bag-ban champion Sen. Mark Hass, D-Beaverton, jumped in and said the nickel charge is not a tax, and pointed to a Legislative Counsel opinion showing so. The next day, the Taxpayer Association of Oregon, which is opposed to the bag ban, accused Hass of trying to censor speech.

So, we wanted to know, is a nickel charge on a paper bag a tax? Is it a de-facto tax?

A tax has a very specific definition in Oregon government. It’s so specific that the state constitution calls for a higher number of votes-- three-fifths of each chamber -- to pass a tax than to pass a fee, which only requires a simple majority. Voters approved the change in May 1996, embedding the provision into the Oregon Constitution. In any case, to be a tax, it must raise revenue for the general treasury.

Former legislative counsel Greg Chaimov agrees with the current Legislative Counsel opinion that the nickel provision is neither a tax nor a fee. ""It’s whatever the grocers want to call it. For constitutional purposes, a fee or a tax is at issue only if it is bringing money into the government.""

Dexter Johnson, the current legislative counsel, said the bag charge would be most similar to the bottle bill deposit, also known as the ""container deposit law."" In Oregon and in other states, you have to pay a nickel extra for beer, soft drinks and bottled water; that money stays with distributors unless you return the bottle to the grocer for your nickel.

And here’s another charge that doesn’t count as a tax or a fee. In 1999, state lawmakers ordered utility companies to assess a ""public purpose charge"" on electricity and gas bills. Much of the money goes to the nonprofit Energy Trust of Oregon, with some proceeds going to weatherize schools and low-income homes. Again, it doesn’t ""raise revenue"" because the money doesn’t go into state coffers -- even if the government dictates how the money should be spent.

Back to the bag charge. The state doesn’t get any of that money. Grocers can spend the money however they want. And shoppers -- and this is critical -- don’t need to pay a nickel for a paper bag. They are free to bring in their own carrying devices, from gym bags to multi-use plastic bags to previously used paper bags. There is no constitutional right to a disposable sack.

Anna Richter Taylor, a lobbyist representing Hilex, argues that for Oregonians who have never before had to pay for a supermarket bag, this is a tax. ""The Legislature can call it what they want, but government -- and not grocers -- is forcing consumers to buy a reusable bag or a paper bag,"" she said.

PolitiFact Oregon doesn’t like paying for something that once was free. But remember, television used to be free. Bottled drinks were once 5 cents cheaper. Utility companies used to not charge 3 percent extra for energy programs. Frankly, we think it’s easier to avoid the 5 cent charge on bags than it is to bypass bottled drinks or the public purpose charge on utility bills.

We rate the claim False.

Ocean State Policy Research Institute says Rhode Island's estate tax is the most significant reason people leave the state
","
With Rhode Island facing a projected $295-million deficit in the next fiscal year, the last thing we need is to have rich taxpayers fleeing the state.

But the Ocean State Policy Research Institute contends that's exactly what is happening, thanks to Rhode Island's estate tax.

OSPRI, which analyzes policy issues ""based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, and traditional American values,"" released a report on Jan. 20 asserting that much of the state's wealth is leaving -- mostly for Florida, which no longer has a state estate tax.

""The most significant driver of out-migration is the estate tax, especially considering that the number one destination state for former Rhode Island residents is Florida, a state with no estate tax (or individual income tax),"" the report asserted.

The lack of an estate tax is what sends people to Florida? Not the lower overall tax burden, including no income tax? And why not the warmer weather?

Nonetheless, OSPRI contends in its 20-page report that people are fleeing in droves and Rhode Island's estate tax is a big part of that.

We decided to take a look.

First, a bit of background.

Rhode Island's estate tax, sometimes called  a ""death tax,"" applies to estates worth over $859,350, a limit indexed to inflation. (There is a proposal in the General Assembly to raise that limit to $1 million.)

The actual tax rate is based on a complicated formula -- isn't it always? -- with a rate that increases as the size of the estate increases. For example, a $1-million estate is taxed at 3.32 percent; a $10-million estate is taxed at 4.98 percent.

The impact, OSPRI contends, has been huge. While the state collected $341.3 million from the tax from 1995 to 2007, OSPRI says the state lost $540 million in other state and local taxes because people left Rhode Island.

The report was paid for by Alan Hassenfeld, a board member and former CEO of toymaker Hasbro, who says he knows high-income people who have left the state, in part because of the estate tax.

The first question is, are more people leaving the state than coming in?

The simple answer is yes. The OSPRI study cites a Census Bureau report showing that from April 1, 2000, to July 1, 2009, Rhode Island's population increased by 4,894. But that was because in-state births far outweighed in-state deaths.

When you look at net migration in and out of the state, we lost 44,649 residents.

The study says it’s the rich who are leaving, but the report makes you wonder.

The adjusted gross income of the average taxpayer leaving the Ocean State from 1996 to 2007 was virtually identical to the income of the taxpayer coming into the state ($45,455 versus $45,742). In 7 out of the 12 years, the income of taxpayers leaving was actually lower than the income for taxpayers coming in.

So if Rhode Island is losing revenue, it's because more taxpayers are departing, not because the emigrants are, on average, wealthier.

The study also says the ""migration of income"" to Florida -- the top destination for Rhode Islanders leaving the state -- was especially pronounced ""in the years after the elimination of Florida's estate tax.""

""Between 1995 and 2003, the average income out-migration from Rhode Island to Florida was $84,570,000 annually; whereas in 2004 and beyond the average income out-migration jumped by 77 percent to $149,702,000 annually.""

So beginning in 2004, according to the study, the Rhode Island estate tax sent taxable income fleeing to Florida.

But the Florida estate tax was still in effect in 2004.

In addition, the number of taxpayers migrating to Florida increased in the years before that tax was eliminated -- not what you would expect if the estate tax was supposed to be keeping them away.

Not only that, during the first year the tax disappeared, the number of people moving from Rhode Island to Florida dropped by 13.6 percent. The decline continued in 2006 and 2007, the last two years examined by the institute. Once again, not what one might expect if the lack of an estate tax was driving movement to Florida.

And the average income of people moving to Florida from Rhode Island plummeted by 29 percent after the Florida estate tax was eliminated. It rebounded in 2006 but by 2007, it was 36 percent lower than when the estate tax was in effect.

J. Scott Moody, the author of the report and a tax policy economist, offered an explanation.

Moody said the rich were moving to Florida in record numbers while the estate tax was still in place in anticipation of its disappearance in 2005. ""Moving is not an instantaneous process,"" he said. ""You have to prove you changed domicile and move all your relationships to Florida. That's usually a yearlong process.""

And once the tax was gone, he said, movement to the state began the steady decline because the rich knew Florida's estate tax was scheduled to reappear in 2010. (It didn't happen.) Thus, his analysis lumped 2004 into the no-Florida-estate-tax category even though the tax was still in effect.

We asked Moody if any published study documented this type of anticipatory behavior when it comes to the estate tax. He said he didn't know of any but predicted that it would be proven in the coming years.

We have other reasons for skepticism.

Moody's study makes an attempt to gauge the different factors that send Rhode Islanders to other parts of the country. It ranks the estate tax at the top; population density is second, and lower income taxes is virtually tied for third place with -- and this struck as particularly odd -- the amount of union membership.

It doesn't prove that people are migrating to a state for a specific reason, Moody said, ""but  people vote with their feet.""

OSPRI's director of policy and organizing, William J. Felkner, who has called for eliminating the estate tax, was even more direct: ""There's no doubt that the estate tax is the most influential.""

The OSPRI study cites just one scholarly report, coauthored by Moody himself:  ""The County-to-County Migration of Taxpayers and Their Incomes, 1995 to 2006"" by The Center for Applied Economics at the University of Kansas School of Business. The paper mentions estate taxes only twice, citing other studies. One of those studies says estate taxes can ""generate out-migration of wealth."" In contrast, the other found that such taxes ""appear to exercise no significant influence over state migration patterns.""

Outside experts we consulted had doubts of their own.

One expert was Kail Padquitt, staff economist for The Tax Foundation, a think tank that studies federal and state tax policies, who said he hasn’t seen any proof that the prospect of paying estate taxes drives people to move.

""You can see people are leaving a state, but (determining) why they are leaving is hard,"" Padquitt said. ""Florida has sunshine, low taxes and warmth. Why wouldn’t people move there?""

In 2006, the National Tax Journal published ""State ‘Death’ Taxes and Elderly Migration -- The Chicken or the Egg?""  The authors, Karen Smith Conway of the University of New Hampshire and Jonathan C. Rork of Vassar College, found no evidence that the elderly are responding to changes in estate taxes.

""We overwhelmingly find no effect of estate taxes once you look over time,"" Conway told us in an e-mail.

Moody said he was unaware of the study.

In summary:

* IRS data cited by OSPRI shows that Florida was increasingly attractive to Rhode Island taxpayers in the years when it had an estate tax. The flow slacked off significantly when the tax was eliminated. That runs contrary to the trend OSPRI claims to have proven.

* OSPRI tries to support its argument by including a year when the tax was still in place. We do not find Moody's ""anticipatory moving"" explanation persuasive.

* OSPRI does not mention other scholarly research reporting that the estate tax has little or no impact on the flow of people from one state to another.

Are some of the people moving from Rhode Island because of the estate tax? Probably.

Is it ""the most significant driver"" as OSPRI claims? They could not prove their case.

We rule their claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC65B340>],/factchecks/2011/feb/13/ocean-state-policy-research-institute/ocean-state-policy-research-institute-says-rhode-i/

Dick Greco says parking expansion didn't raise rates
","
In his run for a fifth term as Tampa’s mayor, Dick Greco often holds up a 75-page report as proof of his track record and experience. 
The report, titled ""Mayor Greco’s Status Report: A Report of the 1995-2002 Accomplishments and Achievements,"" was produced by the city in May 2002. It since has been reprinted and distributed as a paid political advertisement by Greco's campaign for mayor. 
In a department-by-department breakdown of projects and programs, it offers this statement on page 47 under public works: ""Financed the largest parking expansion program without a rate increase."" The expansion added capacity to the Fort Brooke garage and built three new garages, one for police headquarters and two in Ybor City. 
We decided to check the statement that the city managed a multimillion-dollar expansion of its parking system without increasing rates. 
We found that soon after Greco left office, the city had to raise rates partly to repay the debt that financed the expansion. Moreover, those debt payments are more than the parking system can repay from its own revenues, so the city is taking money from its general fund to help make bond payments. 
In September 1997, when Greco announced plans for a $49 million parking system expansion, the St. Petersburg Times reported that ""revenue from the city's parking system would provide the money to repay the bonds, and city officials do not anticipate that the expansion would force them to raise parking rates."" 
But the day after she was elected to replace Greco in 2003, Pam Iorio learned otherwise in a meeting with Greco and his senior staff. 
""That was one of the first things they said,"" Iorio recalled. ""They said, 'You're going to have to raise parking rates.' … It was just a situation that was presented to me that it was something that had to be done."" 
Told of the Iorio's recollection, Greco said, ""I don't remember meeting with her and saying you’ve got to raise parking rates."" 
Iorio requested a 20 percent parking rate increase in 2003, though the City Council approved less than half that. That increase was needed partly to repay the money the city borrowed in the bond market to build new garages during the Greco administration, said Bonnie Wise, the city's chief financial officer. 
That debt has continued to burden the city's parking fund, which is supposed to support itself, as well as the general fund, which pays for things like police, fire and parks, officials say. 
In 2008, the Times reported that the city said it had about $60 million in outstanding debt on parking garages, including one the city built near the Marriott Waterside Hotel in 1995. 
Over the years, however, the parking system has not generated enough revenue to meet its operating costs and cover its bond payments, which total about $6.5 million a year. 
This year, the parking division's $13.5 million in revenue would not cover its annual operating expenses of $14.2 million, let alone make the annual bond payment. 
The economy, of course, plays a role. Fewer workers in downtown Tampa means less revenue. To reduce expenses, Iorio has cut the number of full-time positions in the parking division from 188 to 100, and turned more to automation. 
The city also converted a valuable asset to cash. In 2005, it sold the parking garage on Davis Islands to Tampa General Hospital for $29 million. Of that, $6 million went into the parking division's fund balance, in essence, its reserves. The city used the other $23 million to pay down five years' worth of parking fund debt payments in advance. 
That decision reduced the parking debt payments from $6.5 million to $2.7 million a year from 2005 through 2010. But now that the money from the fund balance has been exhausted, and the bond payments are rising back to $6.5 million a year. 
To cover the parking fund's debt payments this year, the city used the money that remained in the department's fund balance, about $5.4 million, and kicked in another $1.9 million from the city's general fund, according to the city's budget. 
Next year, city officials expect the parking division's fund balance to be empty. That means the city will have to find an estimated $7.3 million from somewhere else, most likely the general fund, to cover the parking division's operating deficit and debt payments. 
The city could have decided not to sell the Davis Islands garage. On the campaign trail, Greco has noted that it was making money. 
But the Davis Islands garage did not make enough to cover the debt payments. In early 2005, the Times reported that its revenues exceeded expenses by $1.2 million a year, not enough to make a $6.5 million bond payment. 
Greco also makes a larger point that the expansion of the city's parking system was not only necessary but helped drive a broader economic expansion. 
Once the city bought the former SunTrust Bank building across from City Hall to serve as a police headquarters, the Police Department needed parking nearby. The expansion of the Fort Brooke garage gave the facility more revenue-generating capacity at a time when it had a long waiting list for available parking spaces. 
Likewise, Greco said, the Ybor City garages, one of which helped facilitate the development of the Centro Ybor retail and entertainment complex, led the way for tens of millions of dollars in other economic activity in Ybor, including the construction of the Kforce staffing company headquarters, the development of the Camden Apartments and the expansion of Hillsborough Community College's campus. 
One thing the Ybor City garages have not done is help the parking division's bottom line. As part of the deal to build Centro Ybor, Greco agreed to charge $1 per car for the first three hours of parking. By comparison, most other city garages charge up to $1.60 per hour. An estimated 80 percent of the cars that park in the Centro Ybor garage pay only a dollar. 
Meanwhile, HCC contributed land and a state grant for the garage built near its campus, and it gets to use most of the spaces in that facility for free. 
True, Greco said, garages cost money, but they bring the city money through economic development and increased property tax revenues. 
""Without parking garages, without some of the things that were done there, you could never have accomplished some of the things that were accomplished,"" he said. 
Greco makes a valid point about building parking garages to stimulate economic development. Other Tampa mayors used other garages for similar purposes. The deal to build the St. Petersburg Times Forum in downtown Tampa came together partly because the city agreed to guarantee the Tampa Bay Lightning about $1.2 million a year from the South Regional parking garage. Similarly, part of event revenues from the William F. Poe parking garage go to a capital improvement fund for the David A. Straz Jr. Center for the Performing Arts. 
But the Greco campaign's statement that under his last administration the city ""financed the largest parking expansion program without a rate increase"" fails to mention the rate increase that took place immediately after he left office. Also, the funding problems since then can't be overlooked. They are a direct result of the expansion, so we rate this statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB07840>],/factchecks/2011/feb/12/dick-greco/dick-greco-says-parking-expansion-didnt-raise-rate/

John Oliver of Daily Show says Rep. Joe Straus is the first Jewish speaker in the Texas House
","Are Jewish Republicans in Texas as rare as a pork rib on a prairie mule? John Oliver, a correspondent for Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, says so, but we noticed a more testable observation he made after his January ""pilgrimage to Tejas."" Two years ago, Joe Straus, R-San Antonio, ""became the first Jewish speaker of the"" Texas House, Oliver said during a segment on the House speaker’s race that aired Feb. 3. ""But that meant trouble when he came up for re-election."" In January, Straus withstood Republican challengers backed by GOP activists who said Straus wasn’t conservative enough to repeat as speaker, especially after Republicans dominated November’s elections, upping their House majority to 101 of its 150 seats. Oliver’s report falls short of demonstrating that Straus’s religion put a drag on his political fortunes. Yet the spoof features people praying for a ""godly, humble leader of the Texas House."" And it closes with schoolchildren marking a new ""high holiday"" in Straus’s honor with a celebratory song that opens with a reference to anti-Semites. Out-of-state humor aside, we wondered if Straus is indeed the first Jewish Texas House speaker. An Austin American-Statesman news article from January 2009, just before House members elevated Straus to the speaker’s post, said he appeared poised to become ""the first Jewish speaker of the Texas House since statehood."" Before Texas was a state, the article says, David Kaufman served as speaker of the House in the Congress of the Republic of Texas from 1839 to 1841. Kaufman was of Jewish descent, ""but historians have found no evidence he was a practicing Jew and he did not receive a Jewish burial, said Hollace Ava Weiner, editor of ‘Lone Stars of David: The Jews of Texas.’"" Rabbi Jimmy Kessler of Temple B’nai Israel in Galveston told us that ""usually a person of the Jewish faith will buried in a Jewish cemetery."" He also pointed to the 1990 book, ""Deep in the Heart: Lives and Legends of Texas Jews: A Photographic History,"" which says that Kaufman ""was of Hebrew descent but not a practicing Jew."" Finally, Bryan Stone, an associate history professor at Del Mar College in Corpus Christi and author of the book, ""The Chosen Folks,"" about Jewish Texans, told us: ""There have been many Jewish members of the Texas Legislature going back to early statehood, but Straus is definitely the first Jewish speaker."" We rate Oliver’s statement as Mostly True. CORRECTION, 12:30 p.m., Feb. 12, 2011: The story below has been amended to remove a description of a 19th century speaker of the Texas House as the sole Jewish member of the Texas Legislature until the 1970s.

"['Oregon', 'Health Care', 'Peter DeFazio']","
Peter DeFazio says Oregonians pay extra to cover the uninsured
","
Don’t look now, but the health care debate, in all its high-decibel, combustible glory is revving up again. The House has already approved a bill calling for the 2010 law to be repealed. The Senate considered a similar proposal but Democrats defeated it.

And now, Rep. Peter DeFazio is stepping into the battle with legislation that would dismantle a central element of the law -- the so-called ""individual mandate"" that requires every American to carry health insurance.

DeFazio says doing away with the requirement would end legal challenges questioning its constitutionality and save people money.

""Congress can quickly resolve the issues of constitutionality and the limits of the federal government by reforming the individual mandate with an opt-out clause that allows for full personal responsibility. I believe buying insurance should be a choice, not a matter of federal coercion,"" DeFazio writes in a Feb. 1, ""Dear Colleague"" letter.

Money, though, is a central element of his pitch. ""Oregon families pay an extra $1,400 a year ... on higher insurance premiums to cover those who do not have insurance,"" DeFazio wrote in his letter.

The clear inference is that if a person voluntarily decides to live without health insurance, the rest of us are off the hook if something bad happens.

""If they waive their right to the federal health care backstop, then they alone are burdened with their future health care costs,"" DeFazio writes.

It’s a clever device that accentuates the emotional argument while conveniently side-stepping some important nuances.

First is the question of cost. DeFazio’s claim that the average Oregonian with insurance absorbs a $1,400 surcharge to cover those without insurance is correct. The practice is called cost shifting and it means that those who have insurance pay higher rates than necessary to cover the cost of those who do not.

DeFazio’s letter suggests, but does not explicitly say, that people’s health insurance premiums would cost less if the mandate is removed. The reason, he says in the letter, is that anyone who makes the choice not to carry insurance would have to sign an affidavit and agree to pay all medical costs.

Multiple studies over the years have analyzed the practice. Most agree that nationally, the cost of health insurance for a family is $1,100 higher as a result of the uninsured. (Politicians from both sides have used the figure, including President Barack Obama.)

One of the first studies came in 2005 from the interest group, FamiliesUSA, which calculated the cost to a family would be $992. Ironically, the group cited that surcharge as a reason for requiring everybody to have insurance since that would spread the cost -- and the coverage -- over a larger population.

As the health care debate intensified, the 2005 work was updated. In 2008, the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress calculated that the ""hidden tax"" jumped, on average, to $1,000. It also provided state-by-state estimates, with the surcharge in Oregon calculated to be $1,400.

""This ‘hidden tax’ on health insurance arises from a failure to continuously cover all Americans and accounts for roughly 8 percent of the average health insurance premium. This cost-shift amounts to $1,100 per average family premium in 2009 and $410 per average individual premium,"" the center said in a 2009 report.

So it’s well established and mostly beyond debate that premiums for those with health insurance are higher to absorb some of the cost for those who don’t have it.

But things break down for those like DeFazio, who try to draw a straight-line cause and effect.

""We do not necessarily assume that the private revenues used to subsidize care to the uninsured inevitably cause higher private payments and insurance premiums,"" the Kaiser Family Foundation study found.

""In particular, the Families USA approach omits the possibility that providers who treat substantial numbers of uninsured people have lower profits. In fact, we are highly skeptical that the high and growing cost of private insurance is strongly related, if at all, to the amount of uncompensated care delivered by private providers or to the growing number of uninsured people,"" Kaiser analysts concluded.

DeFazio’s claim about the ""hidden tax"" is based in fact but he fails to provide sufficient nuance to a complex and emotionally wrought question. For that reason, we rate his claim Mostly True.

Mitt Romney tells CPAC that Canada created more jobs in January than the U.S. did

At the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual pep rally for the political right, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney complained that the economy had not recovered under President Barack Obama. He said, ""Today there are more men and women out of work in America than there are people working in Canada. And in the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did."" 
We’ll look separately at these two claims, which came from his CPAC speech on Feb. 11, 2011. In this item, we’ll analyze the claim that ""in the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did."" 
We found the relevant data for Canada at the website of Statistics Canada. For the month concluding in January 2011, Canada created a net 69,200 jobs.

For the U.S. numbers, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found Romney is correct. Over the same period, the U.S. created a net 36,000 jobs. So the U.S. created about half as many jobs even though it is nine times larger than Canada.

It's worth noting that U.S. job growth was substantially stronger than Canadian job growth in each of the previous three months. In October, the U.S. economy created 171,000 jobs, compared to just 3,000 for Canada. In November 2010, the U.S. economy created 93,000 jobs, compared to 15,200 for Canada. And in December 2010, the U.S. created 121,000 jobs, compared to 22,000 for Canada. But on a per capita basis, in recent months U.S. job creation exceeded Canada's only in October. 
January happened to be a month when U.S. job creation was especially low and Canadian job creation was especially high, but it is the most recent month and it reflects the general pattern when you account for population.

Mitt Romney tells CPAC that more are out of work in U.S. than employed in Canada
","
At the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual pep rally for the political right, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney complained that the economy had not recovered under President Barack Obama. He said, ""Today there are more men and women out of work in America than there are people working in Canada. And in the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did.""

We’ll look separately at these two claims, which came from his CPAC speech on Feb. 11, 2011. In this item, we’ll analyze the claim that ""today there are more men and women out of work in America than there are people working in Canada.""

We began by looking at the number of people employed in Canada. According to the most recent Canadian government statistics, there were 17.2 million Canadians with either full- or part-time employment.

South of the border, the number is a bit harder to pin down.

If you use the official unemployment level as determined by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Romney is clearly wrong. In January 2011, there were 13.9 million Americans who were unemployed -- well below the 17.2 million who have jobs in Canada.

But there’s a way to enlarge the U.S. number. There’s a separate BLS data category for workers who are ""marginally attached to the labor force."" According to the official definition, that means people who ""currently want a job, have looked for work in the last 12 months (or since they last worked, if they worked within the last 12 months), and are available for work.""

For January 2011, a total of 2.8 million people fell into that category. (There’s a well-known subset of this category called ""discouraged workers,"" who are not currently looking for work for one of a variety of reasons. But this group is part of the 2.8 million rather than a separate category.)

So, if you add the 13.9 million unemployed to the 2.8 million who are marginally attached to the labor force, you get 16.7 million people who can be broadly considered ""out of work."" And that’s still a smaller number than the 17.2 million employed in Canada.

So Romney is wrong by both of these counts. Is there a way to calculate the numbers that makes his comment correct?

We contacted Romney’s office, and a spokesman explained how they calculated the statistic.

For the Canadian number, they used the figure for the ""labor force"" (18.7 million, which actually includes both employed and unemployed Canadians) rather than the 17.2 million employed Canadians. This error hurts Romney’s case because it actually raises the bar for making its comparison correct.

As for the U.S., Romney cited statistics from a paper by economist Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal, labor-backed think tank. Shierholz wrote that there are 25.1 million Americans ""who are jobless, have given up looking for work, or who have settled for part-time work but actually want to work full-time."" (Romney’s fact sheet actually said, mistakenly, that the number Shierholz cited was only 21.9 million, but this error also isn’t one that bolsters the accuracy of Romney's claim.)

We think that Romney is inaccurately describing the data in Shierholz's paper. Using the 25.1 million number assumes it is correct to include 8.4 million Americans who are working part-time for economic reasons. While these people are certainly suffering in the current economy, we don't think it's appropriate to call them as ""out of work,"" as Romney does, since they are indeed working and earning income. 
We sought comments on Romney's statement from a conservative economist, the Heritage Foundation's J.D. Foster, and a liberal economist, the Brookings Institution's Gary Burtless, and both of them said Romney's comparison had serious flaws. 
Both economists agreed that it would be incorrect to count part-time workers as ""out of work."" As Foster put it, ""These folks may not be doing what they want and getting paid what they want, but if they are working then they are not out of work."" 
Both also questioned the value of the comparison. 
""Frankly, I don't see that Romney's comparison makes much sense, whether it can be backed up or not,"" Foster said. ""No doubt the total number of people out of work in the United States exceeds the total workforce of Luxembourg. The U.S. and Canada have similar land masses and languages, but otherwise, the comparison strikes me as, let's be diplomatic, ill-chosen."" 
Foster suggested one remote scenario that the comparison might be correct: if you add the number of Americans who have left the work force involuntarily to the ranks of the unemployed. The problem is that there is no official count of involuntary work force departures. He did a rough calculation that it is 4.4 million, which could produce a total of 18.3 million ""out of work"" Americans -- higher than the 17.2 million employed Canadians.

However, not only did Romney not use this calculation, it’s also an unofficial estimate with an unknown margin of error. It could just as easily be 3 million as 4.4 million. So we are not persuaded. 
Ultimately, Romney’s comparison doesn’t work for the official unemployment figure, nor for the numbers that include Americans who are marginally attached to the labor force.
