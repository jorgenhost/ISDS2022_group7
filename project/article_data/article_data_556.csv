Report that Megyn Kelly has been fired from NBC is fake news
","A fake news story falsely said Megyn Kelly’s move from Fox News to NBC is already over, even as the ink on her contract is drying. ""NBC just fired Megyn Kelly before her new show begins,"" reads the headline on a March 8, 2017, article on USPostman.com. The story says that while Kelly left Fox News to be ""a white version of Oprah Winfrey on NBC,"" she has terminated her contract because she didn’t want to do puff pieces and celebrity interviews. We attempted to contact USPostman.com through their Facebook page (the website has no contact information) but did not receive a response. USPostman.com is registered to an address in Macedonia, a known hotbed of fake news websites. PunditFact examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as ""not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism, and everyday life."" It was flagged by Facebook users as being fake. Kelly announced in January 2017 she was leaving Fox News six months before her contract was up. She is moving to NBC, where she reportedly will be hosting a morning show starting in May as well as a Sunday night news magazine. She reportedly gave up an offer of $20 million per year to stay at Fox, where she had accused former CEO Roger Ailes of sexual harassment. A closer reading of the USPostman.com post raises suspicions. It quotes both her supposed new NBC producer Hugh McGovern and NBC Universal CEO Maxwell Seawald as saying unflattering things about her desire and ability to be a journalist. It doesn’t appear these are real people; NBC Universal’s CEO is actually Steven Burke. USPostman.com cites SGSNews.com as the source of its story, but the true source is TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which published its article on March 8. It’s common for fake news websites to appropriate content from other websites. But TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked, admits it makes up its stories. While there isn’t an indication on the post itself, TheLastLineOfDefense.org says on its About Us link that ""all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney."" There’s no such admission on USPostman.com, but the story is still made up. Kelly has not been fired from NBC.

Georgia didn’t ban Muslim culture, as Macedonian websites claimed
","A post that appears to have originated from fake news purveyors in Macedonia used a real news item from months ago to falsely say the U.S. state of Georgia has outlawed ""Muslim culture."" A March 13, 2017, post on USANewsPost.us carried the headline, ""Georgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values.""   Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fake, as part of the social media giant’s efforts to remove fake news from news feeds. PolitiFact Georgia examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as ""not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life."" The story cited an actual event — a Peach State lawmaker had introduced a bill in November 2016 in the Georgia General Assembly that would have banned the wearing of burqas, niqabs and veils. The story trumpeted the bill as being ""about keeping the American people safe."" But the post did not indicate that the legislation never became law. State Rep. Jason Spencer on Nov. 15 filed HB 3 for the 2017 legislative session. The bill aimed to expand the scope of a state law passed in 1951 that made wearing a mask a misdemeanor (unless it was for celebrations, work, sports or emergencies). The original law aimed to prevent Ku Klux Klan members from wearing their hoods. Spencer’s bill could have prevented Muslim women from wearing any kind of head covering while driving, or possibly even while on public property. It also prevented people from wearing veils in driver’s licenses and government-issued IDs, a rule the state already had. ""This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us,"" Spencer told Atlanta’s WSB-TV. The quote is cited in the USANewsPost.us article, which made an inference that if the bill passed, Georgia would have stopped ""Muslim culture"" in a way no other state had. (For the most part, the wearing of religious headcoverings is protected by the First Amendment.) But the bill didn’t pass the General Assembly, because Spencer withdrew the measure just two days later. ""After further consideration, I have decided to not pursue HB 3 in the upcoming 2017 legislative session due to the visceral reaction it has created,"" he said in a statement. ""While this bill does not contain language that specifically targets any group, I am mindful of the perception that it has created. My objective was to address radical elements that could pose a threat to public safety. However, further consideration dictates that other solutions will need to be considered. In conclusion, anti-masking statutes have been upheld as constitutional (State vs Miller, 1990), and HB 3 would withstand legal scrutiny, but not political scrutiny."" The Miller case to which Spencer refers involved a Klan member who challenged the Anti-Mask Act and lost. USANewsPost.us cites DailyUSAUpdate.com as the source of the post, and that site in turn says the post came from OpenMagazines.com. The story also has been shared on Facebook, across several other websites, tens of thousands of times. We contacted OpenMagazines.com via email to ask them about the misleading headline but didn’t hear back. BuzzFeed has previously reported that both OpenMagazines.com and DailyUSAUpdate.com are registered to owners in Macedonia. The former Yugoslav republic became a hotbed of fake news during last year’s presidential election. Buzzfeed found that teenagers in the town of Veles operated at least 140 websites that published fake political news in the United States to draw in advertising dollars. USANewsPost.us also is registered to an administrator and address in Veles. Our ruling Bloggers said in a headline, ""Georgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values."" The post misrepresents the outcome of a months-old and short-lived legislative proposal from November 2016 that could have prevented Muslim women from hearing veils and headscarves. Muslim culture was not banned, although it did appear to briefly be under attack. We rate the headline False.",/factchecks/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/georgia-didnt-ban-muslim-culture-macedonian-websit/

Fake news: Next Star Wars movie seeking alien extras near Houston
","This just in from WBN12: A Star Wars movie seeks Texans to appear as alien extras southwest of Houston. But don’t decamp just yet. This seeming news post proved as fake as a Wookiee. PolitiFact Texas looked into this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as ""not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism and everyday life."" We were suspicious of the Texas-tied call for extras from launch because there’s been no legitimate report out of Hollywood that a Star Wars movie is going to be shot in Texas. It didn’t help that the WBN12.com post is undated or that it’s identical, except for the place name, from a post saying the same about Las Vegas, Nev., that was debunked by Snopes.com--in 2016. Another sign the claim lacks validity? The WBN12 website includes a disclaimer stating: ""wbn12.com is a satirical and fantasy website. None of the articles on wbn12.com should be considered true and are simply works of satire or fantasy meant for entertainment purposes."" The 'call' for Texas extras The post, which came to our attention through PoiltiFact’s fake-news-spotting partnership with Facebook, is datelined Rosenberg, which is home to more than 30,000 people on U.S. 59 nearly 30 miles southwest of downtown Houston. It opens: ""Reports out of Hollywood this morning are confirming that a portion of the next Star Wars movie will be filmed near Rosenberg, Texas. The undisclosed location near Rosenberg will represent a previously unknown planet in the Star Wars universe."" The post continues: ""No details were released as to exactly when production would take place in the Rosenberg area but they stated that it should begin no later than this fall. A casting call for extras will be announced well before that time period, however."" The post goes on to say local fans (no one identified by name) are excited at the prospect and that producers (no one named) said in a statement: ""We think that Rosenberg is a great place to find the hundreds of extras for our alien population and we’re very excited about filming here."" No evidence for a Texas casting call We didn’t reach anyone directly connected to the Disney-owned Star Wars movies. Otherwise a web search turned up a Dec. 22, 2016, post on the moviecastingcall.org website describing casting calls for a Han Solo anthology film including mention that filming is to take place in 2017 ""at the Pinewood Studios in London, England among other undisclosed locations in the United Kingdom,"" pretty far from Texas. Under the subhead ""Extras Casting,"" that post says: ""Casting calls and registration for extras will be posted here as they become available."" We heard back next from the owner of moviecastingcall.org, Alan Baltes, who emailed: ""My website posts accurate information"" about Disney and Marvel casting and auditions. Baltes, noting WBN12’s disclaimer, described its post about casting for Star Wars extras near Rosenberg as one of several that’s surfaced about the next Star Wars film getting shot in Texas. ""The same hoax has been posted over the years, making the same claim, but stating filming would take place in other areas of the United States,"" Baltes wrote. In Rosenberg, a city spokeswoman, Jenny Pavlovich, said by phone that before our inquiry, she hadn’t heard of local Star Wars shoots. A Fort Bend County official, Beth Wolf, said people around the courthouse had heard the Star Wars rumor though she hadn’t encountered confirmation. Wolf said by phone: ""You know, we don’t have that many movies being made here."" Our ruling A web post said extras are being sought to participate in a new Star Wars movie being shot near Rosenberg, Texas.

Did a Florida sheriff say 'blacks should learn to act like white people in order to stay alive?'
","Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan has shared controversial thoughts on race, crime and African-American culture in a couple of videos. But he didn't go as far as some blogs would have you believe. The video clips have circulated across the Internet for years under this headline: ""Florida Sheriff: Blacks should learn to act like white people in order to stay alive."" We noticed the headline on Aazah, a news and entertainment website for LGBTQ persons of color. Facebook flagged a post with the misleading headline as part of its efforts to identify fake news. In this case the headline is misleading, but the contents of the story are not necessarily fake. The spliced video clips of Morgan first circulated about four years ago, said Amber Southard, a spokeswoman for Morgan, who was re-elected to a third term in November 2016.   ""Nowhere in the video does he say"" what the headline says, she said. Morgan has been in the news for controversial statements or practices involving African-Americans, but the claim that he did made the statement in the headline is wrong. We didn’t hear that statement in the videos, and we searched for it in Nexis and found no evidence that Morgan said it. We attempted to reach someone at the website where we saw this headline and were unsuccessful. We can’t fully evaluate Morgan’s comments because they appear to stem from partial videos and not full speeches. However, here is a summary of what he did say in the clips with some added context from other news accounts. PolitiFact Florida examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as ""not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism, and everyday life."" ‘Let me take issue with the title of African-American' In the first video clip, Morgan appears to be speaking in a sheriff’s office. ""First off, let me take issue with the title of ‘African-American,’"" Morgan begins. ""We’re Americans."" Morgan then explains that he is ""fourth-generation Welsh"" and doesn’t refer to himself as a ""Welsh-American."" ""I was not born in Wales and the blacks that currently reside in the United States of America are not from Africa,"" he says. ""Those sorts of terms that society has come to use are divisive in nature."" Morgan then says many issues in the minority community in Escambia County are real while ""most of them are perceived."" Morgan then says that not that many years ago, the thought of an African-American president would have been unthinkable but Barack Obama won election twice by getting the votes of people of various races -- not just blacks. ""If we’re such a racist nation, why do we currently have an African-American president?"" he says. The video shows Morgan offering his critique of the black community: ""We have unfortunately in the black community embraced a thug culture -- one that aggrandizes,  again, foul language, shooting cops, abusing women and if you don’t think those things have an effect on our children, you need to get a grip."" Cites black-on-white crime incidents One of the video clips appears to come from part of a speech that Morgan made at a Rotary Club meeting in August 2013. His speech followed an incident in which two white Escambia deputies shot an unarmed black man who was looking for cigarettes in his mother’s car parked in his driveway. The deputies fired multiple rounds and two bullets struck 60-year-old Roy Middleton, shattering his leg. The deputies were responding to a burglary call. (A grand jury later found insufficient evidence to prosecute the officers but called for more intensive training for deputies.) The video clip circulating on the Internet shows Morgan recounting three violent crime incidents that involved black perpetrators and white victims. ""Last night we had four black male teenagers attack a 77-year-old white man,"" he said. ""Where is the public outrage in that?"" He also recounted a homicide in which he said three black people beat a white woman to death and a time a black man shot an unarmed white man ""execution style."" Morgan then calls for ""equality across the board"" and calls for working together with families, schools and churches to bring back ""character and integrity to our communities."" He says that criminologists have identified the ""rise of the superpredators"" -- people who are ""not tethered to faith, family, religion or community."" ""It's about me, it's about my personal wants, needs and desires to the exclusion of anyone and everything and most assuredly institutions,"" he said. We read news articles about other portions of Morgan’s speech that were not included in the video clips. ""I'll share with you a political axiom that I think is appropriate today for what the Escambia County Sheriff's Office is currently facing,"" he said, according to the Pensacola News Journal. ""When forced to swallow (excrement) ... it is recommended to swallow it whole and for God's sake, don't chew it. We've been handed a couple of these here recently, and I'm doing my best to choke them down."" (Slate wrote that the word Morgan used was ""turds."") The audience laughed, and Morgan then discussed the apparent ""lack of race relations"" in the county. ""I was of the opinion, until just recently, that we have built some bridges in the community, and obviously we have not,"" he said. ""No one is more appalled by this than I ... I will also tell you that we intend to stay the course."" Our ruling A headline that appeared on many websites quoted a Florida sheriff as saying ""blacks should learn to act like white people in order to stay alive."" The articles include video clips of Escambia Sheriff David Morgan giving a Rotary Club address about black-on-white crime and the local outrage over the shooting of a black man by two white police officers. The stories use real quotes from Morgan, but not the one given most prominence in the headline. We listened to the clips and did not hear Morgan make that particular statement.

No, South African officials didn't order a firm to lay off white workers
","Facebook users set the fake news flags waving when a 2015 news item resurfaced recently. The headline from a website with the URL conservative-headlines.com said, ""South African firm ordered to lay off 3,389 white employees."" ""A South African utility company has been given an ultimatum to reduce its number of white employees by 44.3 percent over the next five years,"" the article said. ""This means 3,389 whites have to go. It is part of the Federal ‘Black Empowerment’ program."" The headline misses the mark on its main points, but behind it lie real events. PolitiFact Global News Service examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as ""not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life."" The conservative-headlines.com website, which features images of the Confederate flag and an op-ed in favor of a white ""ethnostate"" in South Africa, took its story from a prominent Afrikaans language news site Netwerk 24. Netwerk 24 was reporting on the affirmative action plans of Eskom, South Africa’s public electric company. South Africa operates under the Employment Equity Act, which says ""employers must make sure designated groups (black people, women and people with disabilities) have equal opportunities in the workplace."" Netwerk 24 reported the 3,389 figure based, it said, on documents Eskom had submitted to three unions. One of the unions, Solidarity, describes itself has having ""a close relationship with the Afrikaner community."" Solidarity opposes ""reverse racism,"" and regularly tangles with the government over affirmative action. The factual part of the claim is this: In November 2014, the South African Labor Department sent Eskom a report telling it to set numerical targets so that the makeup of its workforce would more closely match that of the country at large. The company had to submit a plan to reach those targets by 2020. The report itself doesn’t give a number. But if Eskom didn’t come up with a plan and implement it, then the Labor Department could bring a case against it in the government’s Labor Court and seek to impose a fine. We asked the Solidarity union where it got the figure of 3,389 whites and spokesman Francois Redelinghuys told us ""this number was derived from the employment equity plan Eskom submitted whereby it was envisioned that by 2020 they aim to reduce the amount of white workers as part of their affirmative action strategy."" Redelinghuys didn’t tell us how the number was derived. Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe told us, meanwhile, that ""there is no such plan"" to layoff white workers. In Eskom’s 2016 annual report, the company lays out the workforce makeup it hopes to achieve by 2021. For example, the fraction of black employees in senior management is slated to rise from about 61 percent to 89 percent. It would seem likely that blacks would gain at the expense of whites, but there is no way to translate those changes into absolute numbers. Adding to the complicated picture, the company plans to downsize across the board by about 20 percent. How this all would shake out racially is unclear. In May 2015, Solidarity said in a press release that in the coming year, Eskom planned to cut 1,689 blacks from its rolls, and 1,080 whites. In other words, blacks would be the bigger losers. The company distanced itself from those figures, saying they had been part of a draft plan than was never adopted. But in any event, the numbers don’t bolster the broader claim that whites will suffer more than blacks. If the numbers in the headline are dicey, so is the idea that the government had ""ordered"" Eskom to lay off white workers. Solidarity spokesman Redelinghuys told us that ""we only said that said amount (of) white worker jobs would be reduced. The media made the article about laying off workers."" Professor of labor law Christoph Garbers at Stellenbosch University told us that ""the (government’s) report/ recommendation clearly does not say what the article says."" Garbers said the Labor Department told Eskom to take demographics into account, but ""that is a far cry from interpreting this to mean that Eskom now has to dismiss people."" Garbers also said that by law and precedent ""you can’t justify dismissal on the basis of affirmative action."" Eskom’s spokesman told us that to date, not a single worker has been ""retrenched,"" or as we would say in American English, laid off. Our ruling A Facebook post said that the South African government ordered a company to lay off over 3,000 white workers. The source of the figure remains unclear. While the government did tell the state utility company Eskom to increase the fraction of black workers in various job categories, it did not specify a number. And while the government could take Eskom to court if it failed to adopt a higher goal, it did not order the firm to fire anyone. On that point, even the union most closely identified with white workers agreed. Furthermore, even if that many whites did lose their jobs, the figure alone says nothing about whether more blacks might lose theirs. Eskom plans to downsize and in one plan leaked from the company, that’s exactly what could have taken place. Lastly, South African law bars a company from laying off a worker in order to meet affirmative action goals, an expert told us.

Many of his books are set in North Carolina, and a few of the film versions have been shot here, too, including ""A Walk To Remember,"" ""Safe Haven"" and ""The Longest Ride."" The state’s official tourism bureau even has a guide for a three-day trip around eastern North Carolina, which it calls ""A Nicholas Sparks Tour of the North Carolina Coast."" And Sparks has written a sequel to The Notebook, which is called The Wedding and hasn’t been made into a movie – yet. The stars seemed to align for this rumor. But sadly, it’s fake news. ' A quick search online led to something almost as good as a real movie announcement – a video clip of Conan O’Brien and Ryan Reynolds reenacting The Notebook’s famous kissing-in-the-rain scene, which they jokingly claimed was a trailer for The Notebook 2. This sequel, they said, would be starring Reynolds in the place of Ryan Gosling and O’Brien in the place of Rachel McAdams. So we were pretty sure his Notebook 2 announcement was a joke. But the article circulating about Jacksonville and the film was not nearly so satirical. It correctly named the director of the first film and the place in South Carolina where it was filmed, it gives a brief outline of the plot and has several quotes from unnamed producers from the unnamed company that was allegedly behind the film. The website does contain a disclaimer that it’s a satirical site, but it takes an extra click or two to find and isn’t immediately obvious. And just in case the website had accidentally stumbled onto the truth, we checked with the people who would know if there actually are plans for this movie in the works. Alas, they say, there’s no Notebook 2. ""We have not been contacted by this production,"" said Johnny Griffin, director of the Wilmington Regional Film Commission in eastern North Carolina. He would know; his office was in charge of collecting resumes from local crew members the last time a Sparks movie actually filmed in the area – which was ""The Longest Ride"" in 2014. And the N.C. Department of Commerce, which oversees the N.C. Film Office, said there was no Notebook 2 project anywhere in the state. ""The Film Office is not working on/with any ""Notebook 2"" project,"" Commerce Department spokesman David Rhoades said in an email. Our ruling No, there isn’t a sequel to The Notebook being filmed in North Carolina. Not everything that looks like legitimate news actually is. Even if it’s a story about your long-lost love repairing the home he once promised would be yours, be sure to double-check if it’s true. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!

Will the federal government require devices to slow down motorcycles?
","Springtime in New Hampshire means motorcyclists are itching to hit the state’s scenic, winding roads. But if they trusted a widely distributed news article last year, they might think they need to install a device that limits their motorcycle to 75 mph – per a federal government regulation – before they can ride. Since the Granite State has the second-highest motorcycle ownership rate nationwide – one bike for every 17 people – a mechanical requirement imposed by the federal Department of Transportation would hit the state especially hard. An estimated $35 price tag for the speed governors would cost New Hampshire’s motorcycle riders more than $2.5 million to bring all 73,000 bikes registered statewide into compliance. It would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to bring the 8 million-plus motorcycles across the United States into compliance, based on the article published by Associated Media Coverage. Despite the alarm, there was never any such rule proposed, much less mandated. The apparent news story with the headline """"New regulation requires motorcycle owners to install 75 MPH governor by January 2017,"" wasn’t true. There was no requirement to install speed governors, and the article’s lone quoted source, James Littleton, a purported representative of the DOT, doesn’t appear to exist. Nevertheless, it reached nearly 10,000 people – perhaps more though social media – within a matter of days, according to a cached version of the article, which was subsequently removed. Maybe those readers – 5,500 of whom clicked the like button on the Associated Media Coverage website – should have slowed down. In addition to removing the article, the website Associated Media Coverage appears to have rebranded itself. Its old URL now redirects to a page called The Seattle Tribune. It also adopted a marginally less-confident tagline: its old motto ""News You Can Trust"" is now simply ""Informing the Nation."" The Seattle Tribune describes itself as ""a news and entertainment satire web publication … Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental."" It has no association to the 126-year-old newspaper, The Seattle Times. PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to examine this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as ""not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life."" The motorcycle claim – and its apparent intent to irritate motorcyclists – is the type of story that made up this fake news outlet’s bread and butter. The hoax-debunking website Snopes, which found the claim to be false, made this comment about the ""fake news"" Associated Media Coverage article: ""The sensational claim was one of several hoaxes recently promulgated by the Associated Media Coverage fake news site, the most popular of which pertained to purported laws that would affect specific subsets of the population (such as motorcyclists or e-cigarette users),"" Snopes wrote. If its goal was to rile up one of those subsets – and thereby drive clicks to the website – it worked on at least one motorcycling forum, DungBeetleBikers.com. A user called Prickle posted the verbatim article two days after it first appeared July 31, 2016. An Australian user called Roo promptly responded to the made-up spokesman’s reasoning that the speed limits would promote safety: ""Per capita exposure to road trauma on a motorcycle is always going to be much higher than say that of cage drivers,"" Roo wrote, referring to non-biker motorists as ""cage drivers"" and continuing indignantly, ""So, cages are exempt? That makes sense, dunnit?"" It turns out speed limiters, or governors, are a real thing. You can buy them online for cars, motorcycles and ATVs, but the cost is usually a few hundred dollars, not the ""subsidized cost"" of $35 as the article states. The article goes on to make a couple of other assertions that are easily disproved. The first tries to peg the number of annual motorcycle fatalities: ""... each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States."" Actually, 4,693 motorcyclists died in the U.S. last year, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which analyzed data from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fatality Analysis Reporting System.The peak years for motorcycle fatalities in 1980 and 2008 never topped 5,112. The second assertion is that 73 percent of motorcycle fatalities ""are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds."" Wrong again. Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that only 33 percent of all motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were speeding, according to an analysis by the Insurance Information Institute. In both cases, the figures cited in the article are nearly double the numbers put forth by authorities. When Snopes assessed this claim last August, it noted that Associated Media Coverage, unlike the Seattle Tribune, didn’t identify itself as ""fake news"" or a satirical website. ""While many fake news sites include disclaimer notices informing readers that their content is not credible, Associated Media Coverage does not. As such, many of the less ostentatious claims (such as the 75 MPH motorcycle speed governor one) spread on social media amid a targeted audience,"" Snopes wrote. Bottom line: The only thing bikers need to worry about if they go over 75 mph is a speeding ticket. Our ruling The website Associated Media Coverage claimed the federal Department of Transportation was forcing motorcycle owners to install speed governors on their motorcycles that would limit their max speeds to 75 mph. That assertion was never true and was sourced to a made-up federal government official. Supporting statistics that the phony spokesman cited also exaggerated the number of motorcycle fatalities each year and the propensity for speeding among people killed in those crashes. The website did not identify itself as a purveyor of fake news, and some motorcyclists took the bait.

Yet we don’t recall a headline like this one in any mainstream news source: ""BREAKING: President Trump Just Told Paul Ryan ‘You’re Fired.’"" (""You’re fired"" was Trump’s catchphrase on the show.) The headline was on an article posted on TheLastLineOfDefense.org on March 14, 2017 (10 days before the Republican plan to replace Obamacare collapsed, with some conservatives blaming Ryan).

The article, which doesn’t spell out what precipitated Trump’s alleged statement, ends by stating that Trump approached Ryan at a luncheon and told him: ""Mr. Speaker, you’re fired.""

‘Uspoln’ puts rape pregnancy words in ex-US Sen. Rick Santorum’s mouth
","Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum has been a pro-life stalwart throughout his political career. He’s regularly said he would oppose abortion in all cases -- even incidents of rape and incest. But did he recently go so far as to say, ""Sometimes pregnancy is God’s way of comforting rape victims?"" According to Uspoln, a ""U.S. political news"" site with 23,000 Facebook likes (and some of the weirdest ""you may also like"" links of all time), Santorum made the comment on ""Piers Morgan Live"" in mid-February. It uses that quote as a headline and then presents further comments about abortion attributed to Santorum.       Here’s the thing: Santorum didn’t give most of these comments in the way Uspoln presented them, and he certainly didn’t say them this year. Uspoln published the article Feb. 18, 2017. Its article states Santorum spoke to Piers Morgan ""last Friday,"" which would have been Feb. 17. That is not possible. Morgan has been off the air since 2014. He is currently working as an editor for the Daily Mail.   Now, during his time on CNN, Morgan did once host Santorum. During Santorum’s presidential run in 2012, he and his family appeared on the show, and Morgan asked him about abortion in cases of rape and incest.   Uspoln’s article partially paraphrases and partially directly quotes Santorum. It says, ""sexual assault victims should ‘accept this horribly created’ pregnancy because it is ‘nevertheless a gift in a very broken way’ and that, when it comes down to it, a victim ‘just has to make the best out of a bad situation.’"" Uspoln also quotes Santorum and Morgan having an exchange in which Santorum compares a pregnancy through rape to a suicide bombing.    This is the full statement Santorum made to Morgan, according to a transcript from the show: ""As horrible as the way that that son or daughter and son was created, it still is her child. And whether she has that child or doesn't, it will always be her child. And she will always know that. And so to embrace her and to love her and to support her and get her through this very difficult time, I've always, you know, I believe and I think the right approach is to accept this horribly created -- in the sense of rape -- but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way, the gift of human life, and accept what God has given to you. As you know, we have to, in lots of different aspects of our life. We have horrible things happen. I can't think of anything more horrible. But, nevertheless, we have to make the best out of a bad situation."" According to the transcript, the conversation between Santorum and Morgan about suicide bombing and a pregnancy from a rape did not occur.      Santorum’s remarks did lead to some backlash in 2012. An opinion writer for The Guardian, for instance, wrote a critical story on Santorum with the headline, ""Rick Santorum thinks pregnancy through rape is God’s gift? Seriously?""   Uspoln did not respond to an interview request. The site appears to regularly twist and embellish the words of famous politicians and then publish or re-publish the articles months after the comments were made. For example, after a Sarah Palin Facebook post about Black Lives Matter caused controversy last summer, Uspoln ran an article falsely claiming Palin said, ""I’m sick of being called a racist. If it’s dangerous for blacks here, they can go back to Africa."" Our ruling The website Uspoln claimed Rick Santorum said, ""Sometimes pregnancy is God’s way of comforting rape victims"" and also made other comments comparing suicide bombing and pregnancies because of rape in February 2017 on a TV show with Piers Morgan. ""Piers Morgan Live"" has not been on television since 2014 and in a 2012 interview with Morgan, Santorum made no such comments. Though he did say pregnancy from a rape should be ""approached...as a gift in a very broken way,"" Santorum did not say pregnancy was ""God’s way of comforting rape victims"" and made no comparisons to suicide bombing.   We rule the claim False.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/217c286c-c3a4-4b7a-94f0-202ed85b3329",/factchecks/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/uspoln-puts-rape-pregnancy-words-ex-us-sen-rick-sa/

Does the U.S. have about as many military band members as diplomats?
","President Donald Trump is meeting bipartisan resistance to his plan to trim about 30 percent from the State Department and foreign aid to help pay for a big boost in defense. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle on the House Foreign Affairs Committee pushed back against such hefty cuts at a March 28 hearing. They asked one witness, former ambassador Nicholas Burns, what he thought of them. Burns served in the administrations of Bill Clinton and both Bushes. He cautioned that ""the only place to cut in the State Department is personnel."" ""You're going to have to make some cruel choices,"" Burns continued. ""The State Department is not big. As Bob Gates said when he was secretary of defense, there are about as many members of the Armed Forces marching bands as there are American diplomats."" That certainly gave the trade-off between ammo and diplomacy an unusual twist. We thought we’d dig into the numbers. The result? This comparison is a bit off key. There’s no question that the Pentagon keeps thousands of musicians on hand. A fact sheet on the 2017 Defense appropriations bill said ""the Defense Department currently fields more than 130 military bands worldwide, composed of more than 6,000 musicians."" In 2016, Politico reported that the total number of trombone, trumpet, keyboard and other instrument players stands at about 6,500. That’s a lot of Souza marches, but the State Department fields a bigger squad of diplomats. There are 8,106 Foreign Service officers, according to a State Department report. (The State Department has about another 5,700 people to support the diplomats, but they don’t do direct diplomatic work.) Still, there are a good 1,600 more diplomats than musicians. Among that slender subset of the population that talks about the State Department budget, this is a popular comparison. Burns, as he said, was citing Gates, who in turn had borrowed the line from former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Although, reading Gates’ words from 2010, it sounds as if he thought Rice was speaking a bit over the top. ""Condi Rice used to say, 'We have more people in military bands than they have in the Foreign Service.' She was not far wrong,"" Gates said. Hillary Clinton used a permutation of this talking point in her 2009 confirmation hearing for secretary of state. She said ""there are more members in military bands than there are Foreign Service officers serving overseas."" (Our emphasis.) All of them used the quasi-stat to underscore that Congress finds it easier to fund the Defense Department than the State Department. We shared our findings with Burns; he said it was helpful to know it wasn’t accurate. ""In any case, the Foreign Service is quite small in comparison to DOD and Homeland Security,"" he said. ""The Trump proposal to cut State/USAID by 31 percent is reckless."" Making the comparison department-wide, Burns is on firmer ground. Including support staff, the State Department has about 14,000 people in the Foreign Service. The Defense Department has about 1.3 million active duty soldiers. On that scale, the 1,600 person advantage that diplomats hold over band members is a rounding error. For close readers, we note that Burns added the ""marching"" part. We don’t know how many military musicians walk and how many sit. From the military bands’ websites, it does seem they do a lot of marching. Our ruling Burns said that there are about as many members of military marching bands as there are diplomats. In plain numbers, there are about 6,500 military musicians and about 8,100 diplomats. So, in fact, the diplomats have about a 1,600 staff advantage. But in the sense that diplomats are the backbone of the Foreign Service, while musicians, as important as they might be for morale, play a lesser numerical role in defending the nation, the numbers are closer than simple math would say. It’s time to retune this talking point, but on balance, we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/mar/31/nicholas-burns/are-there-more-military-band-members-diplomats/

The truth behind a GOP gov. hopeful’s Wolf nickname: ‘Thomas the Tax Engine’
","A businessman without political experience using his outsider status to rise to power: It worked for President Donald Trump, and now Western Pa. Republican Paul Mango — a Harvard-educated veteran and former healthcare consultant — will attempt to use it to take the governor’s mansion in Harrisburg. Mango kicked off his campaign in May, running in part on an anti-tax platform. At an event at Lackawanna College in mid-May, Mango called Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf ""Thomas the Tax Engine,"" according to The Scranton Times-Tribune. ""He has never met a tax he doesn’t like,"" Mango continued to reporters. ""He has requested almost $6 billion in taxes in the years he’s been in office. We cannot afford any more of Tom Wolf."" Mango has repeatedly used that nickname for Wolf, including in a campaign video posted to YouTube on May 18. What’s changed, however, is Mango’s estimate for Wolf’s proposed tax increases: from $6 billion to more than $8 billion during the governor’s time in office. ""Governor Wolf is refusing to accept a revenue plan unless it includes tax increases,"" a July 24 post on Mango’s campaign Facebook page states. ""As Governor, Wolf has already proposed more than $8B in tax increases."" Has Wolf earned the Tax Engine sobriquet? When contacted about the $6 billion claim in May, a Mango campaign advisor, Matthew E. Beynon of consulting firm BrabenderCox, shared a spreadsheet that showed $5.7 billion in estimated revenue from tax increases and modifications for budget years 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18. The sources listed were Wolf’s executive budgets. While the revenue estimates for years 2016-17 and 2017-18 matched those under the heading ""PROPOSED TAX AND REVENUE MODIFICATIONS"" in Wolf’s proposed budgets, the estimate for 2015-16 did not. Mango’s campaign estimated 2015-16 revenue at $1.9 billion, while Wolf’s own budget showed the revenue estimate at $4.6 billion. The bulk of that — an estimated $2.4 billion — would have come from an increase in the personal income tax rate and an additional $1.6 billion from a higher and expanded sales and use tax. When asked about the discrepancy, Beynon said, ""We based our initial numbers by taking the most conservative estimates that we found."" The campaign revised the numbers, he said, to project $8.6 billion in ""tax increases"" during Wolf’s time in office. That $8.6 billion figure appears to come from combining the positive revenue estimates from tax changes proposed in Wolf’s first three budgets. It falls to an estimated $8.3 billion when tax cuts and modifications that would have resulted in a revenue reduction in budget years 2015-16 and 2016-17 are included. Gina Diorio, director of media relations for the Commonwealth Foundation, said the conservative think-tank would use that $8.3 billion number as the estimate for Wolf’s tax increase requests during his time in office. However, Marc Stier, director of the nonpartisan Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, says it is misleading to look at the proposals cumulatively. Proposed tax changes from Wolf's first budget did not pass and were modified and carried over to the second. The same goes for Wolf's second and third budget proposals, although to a lesser degree. In budget year 2016-17, Wolf proposed $2.7 billion in tax changes. Stier said that’s practically what Wolf asked for during his first budget year when one takes into account the $2.1 billion in property tax relief it would have provided. ""That is a tax shift,"" he said. Hypothetically, if Wolf’s requests for tax increases would have been granted during the first year, there would be no deficit today and therefore no need to increase taxes. ""If the General Assembly had enacted [Wolf’s] tax proposals from the first or the second year, there would be no need to enact any taxes this year,"" Stier said in a follow-up email. ""We have a two-year deficit (this year and next year) that approaches $4 billion. If we raised $2.7 billion (or a bit more with inflation) this year and next, we would have $5.4 billion more revenue over two years. Thus there would be no need for new tax revenues."" The Commonwealth Foundation’s Diorio said she couldn’t ""conjecture what might or might not have been introduced had certain tax proposals passed."" When asked about Mango's tax claim, Beth Melena, communications director for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, said Wolf was working to restore $1 billion in education cuts and was dealing with ""a massive budget deficit"" when he proposed his first budget. The statement did not directly address the number. Our ruling Mango asserted at a campaign kickoff event that Wolf has requested ""nearly $6 billion in taxes"" since taking office. His campaign revised that estimate to more than $8 billion, which is approximately the total revenue estimate from tax changes in Wolf’s three budgets combined. But one expert says looking at the proposals cumulatively is misleading, as proposed changes that did not pass were modified and carried over from one year to the next.

Headline states Debbie Wasserman Schultz headed to mental hospital, but that's not true
","U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been criticized for waiting to fire an information technology employee who did work for her office until his recent arrest. While many other Democratic members fired Imran Awan months ago when news reports stated he was under investigation, Wasserman Schultz waited until July 25, the day after his arrest for bank fraud. (Awan was a shared employee among multiple House members.) For all of the questions about how Wasserman Schultz handled the situation, there have been unsubstantiated attacks on the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman from Broward County. The website US Daily News 24 compiled various news reports, blogs and tweets about the Awan investigation in a July 28 post. However, the clickbait headline of the story is totally unsupported. It states: ""Wasserman Schultz going to mental hospital after what she did overnight desperate to escape arrest."" There is no evidence that Wasserman Schultz is headed to a mental health facility. In fact, other than the headline, the article itself makes no mention of her going to a mental hospital or facing arrest -- and it’s unclear what the author is alluding to that she did ""overnight."" Instead, the article contains some sweeping statements about her alleged state of mind with no evidence, such as there are reports that Wasserman Schultz ""has been an absolute wreck since Imran’s arrest"" and an unsourced text posted on twitter alleging that she was spotted berating her daughter about buying a $2 purse. We found no contact information for US Daily News 24, although we left a comment in the comments section asking for evidence. We found the same post on Freedom Daily and used their contact form but did not get a reply. The article does correctly state that Awan was picked up by police at the Dulles International Airport while he was attempting to leave the country. The criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., states that on July 24 Awan had purchased a flight to Qatar and then to Lahore, Pakistan, with a return flight in January. He was arrested on one count of bank fraud related to allegations that he provided inaccurate information when applying for a home loan. He pleaded not guilty. The criminal complaint makes no mention of allegations reported since February by Buzzfeed, Politico and The Daily Caller that Awan and other relatives were under investigation related to a procurement scam and theft of equipment and data. The articles we read attributed key information to unnamed sources. There is no evidence that Wasserman Schultz faces arrest. Eva Malecki, a spokeswoman for the United States Capitol Police, told the Miami Herald, a PolitiFact Florida news partner, on Feb. 8 that ""no members are being investigated"" related to the actions of the House IT support staff. Unrelated to this fact-check, the Miami Herald asked Wasserman Schultz’s spokesman David Damron on July 28 if she had scheduled any public events for the August congressional recess. Damron said that she planned to spend some time with family out of town during the first couple of weeks and would do district events later during the recess. The A. Philip Randolph Institute, an AFL-CIO group, also announced that Wasserman Schultz will speak at the group’s education conference in Broward on Aug. 3. Through Damron, Wasserman Schultz told PolitiFact that the website is a ""false story."" A US Daily News 24 article headline states ,""Wasserman Schultz going to mental hospital after what she did overnight desperate to escape arrest."" While there are some statements in the article itself which are accurate -- including that a man who did IT work for her was arrested -- there is no evidence to support the headline. The article contains no information to prove that she is going to a mental hospital, only allegations that she is an ""absolute wreck."" There is also no evidence in the article that she has tried to escape arrest. The U.S. Capitol Police said in February that no members were under investigation.

Is Wisconsin offering to pay more than it will collect in taxes to land giant Foxconn plant?
","Amid the euphoria over the announcement that a company promising $10 billion and 13,000 jobs will set up shop in Wisconsin, questions have been raised about whether the state is giving away too much in incentives in order to close the deal. ""Diligence Required on Foxconn Job,"" warned a headline on a July 28, 2017 blog post from One Wisconsin Now, a liberal advocacy group that claims 96,000 online supporters. But the post itself went further, opening with this salvo: Gov. Scott Walker wants state taxpayers to dole out up to $250 million annually in incentives to Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn to lure a manufacturing plant to Wisconsin that he claims will generate $181 million in tax revenue.

Think about that. Gov. Walker proposes we pay about $70 million more a year in incentives to a foreign corporation than will flow back to our state coffers. Does that sound like a good deal to you? So is that really the deal: Taxpayers pay up to $250 million a year to get the manufacturing plant, but get back only $181 million a year in tax revenue? This claim is essentially correct on the two numbers, but it leaves out a big part of the equation. The deal Two days before the blog post, Walker joined President Donald Trump and other officials at the White House to announce that Foxconn, after considering several other states, had decided to put the first liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturing facility in North America in Wisconsin. The displays would be made for computer screens, televisions and the dashboards of cars. Walker tweeted that the company, perhaps best known for making Apple’s iPhone at factories in China, would be bringing 13,000 jobs to the state. We rated his claim Half True. Foxconn itself has said only that the plant will create 3,000 jobs, ""with the potential to grow to 13,000 new jobs."" Much hinges on the company’s pledge to invest $10 billion, in exchange for $3 billion in incentives from the state. The numbers To back its statement, One Wisconsin Now pointed us to reports from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that said the $3 billion in incentives could be doled out at a rate of $200 million to $250 million per year over 15 years; and that the state expects to collect $181 million in state and local tax revenue annually. But it stands to reason the state wouldn’t approve a losing deal without expecting something more. And that’s what we heard from the economic and tax experts we talked to. They agreed that Walker is making the deal not only to get the Foxconn plant, but the many other businesses, jobs and related economic activity that is expected to be triggered by such a massive development. The Walker administration estimates ""at least 22,000 indirect and induced jobs throughout the state"" and an economic impact of least a $7 billion per year. The massive development is expected to generate other new businesses, new housing and other economic activity that will, in turn, produce even more tax revenue. ""That’s what the state is banking on,"" Marquette University economics professor Abdur Chowdhury said, referring to what some call the ""multiplier effect."" Whether Foxconn follows through in full on its promises, and to what extent it will generate other economic development in Wisconsin, of course, remains to be seen. Chowdhury cited Foxconn’s promises in other places that didn’t come to pass. And two other experts -- Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., and Steven Deller, interim director of the  Center for Community and Economic Development at the University of Wisconsin Extension -- told us they think estimates on the Foxconn multiplier effect are too rosy. But whether Wisconsin is making a good deal isn’t part of this fact check. Our rating One Wisconsin Now says Walker ""wants state taxpayers to dole out up to $250 million annually in incentives"" to Foxconn ""to lure a manufacturing plant to Wisconsin that he claims will generate $181 million in tax revenue."" Walker does want to offer $200 million to $250 million per year over 15 years in incentives in order to get Foxconn to put its plant in Wisconsin, and the estimate is that the project will produce $181 million per year in tax revenue. But what’s left out of the statement is that Walker and others are pursuing the deal in large part because the massive development is expected to generate other new businesses, new housing and other economic activity that will, in turn, produce even more tax revenue.

Have corporations 'never made as much money' as now, as Donald Trump tweeted?
","In what has become a regular occurrence, Donald Trump took to Twitter to tout the nation’s economic performance on his watch. In a tweet on the morning of Aug. 1, 2017, Trump praised some of the commentary about the Trump-era economy on Fox & Friends: "" ‘Corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now.’ Thank you Stuart Varney @foxandfriends Jobs are starting to roar,watch!"" ""Corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now."" Thank you Stuart Varney @foxandfriends Jobs are starting to roar,watch! We thought the remark about corporate profits was worth a closer look. The White House did not respond to an inquiry. The details of this are a bit complicated given the fact that Trump is implying he deserves some credit. That’s because the most recent data is from January 2017, which predates Trump taking office. In January 2017, corporate profits totaled $1.81 trillion on an annualized basis, according to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. That’s the highest in history in raw dollars. But the high profits Trump is touting came during President Barack Obama’s tenure. And as we always point out in these cases, this is not due solely to Trump (or Obama). For better or for worse, presidents have a modest impact on the economy. Cyclical factors, the international economy, demographics and technology all play important roles, and they tend to be beyond the control of any president. Second, experts say measuring raw dollars is not as illustrative as analyzing corporate profits as a percentage of overall gross domestic product. That analysis, it turns out, paints Trump’s claim in a less impressive light. As the chart below shows, the January 2017 data point, while impressive, is far from unprecedented. That’s due in large part to the reality that the economy tends to grow over time, with corporate profits not necessarily outpacing the overall growth level. The current level of corporate profits as a share of GDP was exceeded once during Harry Truman’s presidency, five times under President George W. Bush, and a 14 times under President Barack Obama. In fact, that’s almost half of the quarters during Obama’s tenure (44 percent). Now let’s take a step back. What do these numbers actually mean? Economists say that measuring corporate profits is useful -- up to a point. On the one hand, ""prosperity is ordinarily good news for both business owners and workers,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ""It is certainly fair to cite high business profits as an indicator the economy is doing well."" However, Burtless added that when corporate profits are historically high, they might be crowding out wage or salary increases for workers, which ends up curbing how widely the prosperity spreads through the rest of the economy. Economists offer divergent views on how stark this tradeoff is. Dan Mitchell, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed that ""capital and labor compete for shares of income in the short run."" Over the long term, however, ""there is no tradeoff between corporate profits and labor income,"" he said. But Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, countered that ""high corporate profits are good for people who own lots of stock -- that’s about it."" In fact, Baker said, the historical record suggests that high levels of investment -- in people and otherwise -- doesn’t necessarily move in tandem with high profits. Either way, one conclusion does seem clear: The share of the economy devoted to wages has been decreasing over the long term. Here’s a chart showing employee compensation as a share of gross domestic product since the end of World War II. Trump tweeted that ""corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now."" In raw dollars, corporations are making more money as of January 2017 than ever before. It’s worth noting that the data isn’t in for a Trump-only quarter. And as a share of the broader economy, corporate profit levels are not unprecedentedly high -- in fact, for almost half of the quarters under Obama, the share was even higher.

Rauner's Chicago schools ""bailout"" claim rooted in political histrionics, not numbers
","The sequel to Illinois’ historic budget standoff is rapidly coming to a head in Springfield, with millions of schoolchildren caught in the middle of poisonous relations between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Chicago Democrats. The dispute, at the center of a new special legislative session called by Rauner, holds the potential to block billions of dollars of state funding for elementary and secondary schools across Illinois just before a new school year is set to begin. At issue is a catch built into the state budget that became law on July 6 over Rauner’s objections. It says that no school funding can be issued anywhere unless a separate measure containing an ""evidence based"" funding model, such as that contained in Senate Bill 1 (SB1), also becomes law that overhauls the formula for distributing general state aid to give a bigger share to districts with more low-income students. SB1 passed the General Assembly in May with almost exclusively Democratic votes but was in parliamentary limbo until July 31 when it landed on Rauner’s desk and he mulled carrying through on a threat to use his amendatory veto power to strike tens of millions of dollars for the financially beleaguered Chicago Public Schools. (Update: The next day, August 1, Rauner carried through on his amendatory veto threat.) Rauner telegraphed his action in a July 20 press release. ""As written, the bill includes a bailout of Chicago’s broken teacher pension system,"" Rauner said,arguing that the measure rewarded Chicago at the expense of suburban and Downstate districts. Democrats beg to differ. As the numbers fly and hyperbole grows, we decided to take a closer look at Rauner’s ""bailout"" claim. Believe it or not, there is one thing on which Illinois politicians of all stripes have agreed for years: The state’s system for funding public schools largely through local property taxes is woefully unfair. While low-income districts scramble to provide classroom basics, more affluent districts can afford to create some of the finest educational facilities and programs in the nation. A 2015 report by The Education Trust put it starkly: In Ohio, the highest poverty districts receive 22 percent more in state and local funds per student than the lowest poverty districts; in Illinois, the poorest districts receive 20 percent less. To address this inequity, Rauner last year formed the bipartisan Illinois School Funding Reform Commission. In February, it issued a report recommending an ""evidence-based"" formula in which financial and academic need would become the main determinant of how state education dollars are distributed. The formula should be applied so that no school district loses funding, the report also said, a goal only met with an increase in overall state school spending. That led to SB1, which won passage with only a single Republican vote in the House and none in the Senate. No school district gets less state money under the bill, but many low-income districts get more. With low-income students accounting for 80.2 percent of its enrollment, CPS is among the latter group. While dismissing SB1 as a Chicago ""bailout,"" Rauner hasn’t said how he wants to change it. Nor has he addressed the inconsistency in arguing that the Chicago pension system is undeserving of state help because it is ""broken"" when it is still in healthier financial shape than the state-run pension system for all other teachers in Illinois.    The governor is clearly irked that SB1 includes $221 million in state funding to help CPS cover the employer share of pension contributions for Chicago teachers. The provision is designed to remedy an historical quirk in which the state subsidized the costs of teacher pensions for every school district in Illinois except Chicago. Mayor Rahm Emanuel complained the arrangement meant Chicago taxpayers were double-taxed, first to pay for teacher pensions in the city and then to contribute to the cost of teacher pensions everywhere else in Illinois. The Chicago based Center for Tax and Budget Accountability estimates that in fiscal year 2016, about $230 million in individual income taxes collected in Chicago were used for suburban and downstate teacher pension payments. In a July 25 interview with WHBF Channel 4 in the Quad Cities, Rauner said he objected to SB 1 because it gave Chicago pension relief while also letting it keep other current funding. ""It’s unfair to Illinois taxpayers and to our kids that they get both. They can either choose a block grant or the pension but they can’t do both,"" Rauner said. School districts in Illinois get state funding through two channels. ""General"" state aid is distributed based on a formula that factors in each district’s property tax resources. They also get funding through ""mandated categoricals,"" which are per pupil grants for specific purposes including special education, transportation and free lunch programs for low income students. CPS receives its categorical funding in a ""block grant"" that is determined using a formula developed in 1995 when the district had many more students than it does today. The block grant was created to ease administrative red tape for CPS, but declining enrollment means it also has led to a windfall for city schools. The most recent report from the Illinois State Board of Education showed that CPS received $478 million in categorical funding in the 2015-2016 school year but would have received only $226 million under the system imposed on other districts.   Even so, Stand for Children, an education reform group that became active in Illinois six years ago at then private citizen Rauner’s urging, sees as flawed the governor’s claim that the SB1 financing package is skewed to favor Chicago. Rauner’s own reform commission recommended that any new funding formula ensure no district get less this year than last, Stand for Children points out. As for the state pension pickup, the group says SB 1 only puts CPS on equal footing with the rest of the state. Rauner’s complaint about Chicago’s block grant constituting a bailout ignores one of the most important aspects of SB 1: After the first year  -- in which no district would receive less funding -- Chicago’s special block grant goes away. CPS is then required to abide by the same formula for calculating the size of categorical grants imposed on other districts. ""The main principle going into this ‘evidence-based model’ conversation that everyone acknowledged was we can’t take money from districts, we can’t pit districts against each other, we can’t create winners and losers,"" said Jessica Handy, government affairs director for Stand for Children Illinois. ""With block grant funding, you can’t say, ‘No district loses except we don’t like this thing so we’ll take it away from Chicago.’"" In another analysis of SB 1, the liberal-leaning Center for Tax and Budget Accountability said cutting the current block grant for CPS would undercut the very purpose of the governor’s commission. ""Not cutting funding CPS already receives is rational -- given that CPS’s current level of funding is some $2.1 billion less than what the evidence shows is needed to educate its students,"" a CTBA report concluded. ""The goal after all is to move all districts forward towards adequacy."" Both Stand for Children and the CTBA cite another statistic to bolster their argument that SB 1 is fair: CPS educates roughly 20 percent of the state’s children and figures to be in line for roughly 20 percent of all new school funding if the bill’s evidence-based formula kicks in. It’s also worth noting that Rauner has for more than a year been open to the idea of sending pension relief to CPS in exchange for other pension reforms. He vetoed a bill that would have given CPS $215 million for pensions in December, not because he opposed the idea but because he said Democrats reneged on a deal that tied CPS pension relief to approval of a broader pension reform plan for all state workers. Some, but not all, of Rauner’s pension wish list was included by majority Democrats in the $36 billion state budget they enacted on July 6 over the governor’s veto. Attempting to parse a political buzzword like ""bailout"" might be impossible if not for the clear direction provided by Rauner’s own Illinois Education Funding Reform Commission. It called for an ""evidence-based"" school funding formula but also recommended a ""hold harmless"" provision that would ensure no district received less this year than last. By that dictate alone, CPS should not be in line this year for a cut in the size of its block grant. What’s more, SB1 does do away with the CPS block grant starting with the 2018-19 school year, poking a major hole in Rauner’s ""bailout"" claim. The bill’s Chicago pension component can’t be called a ""bailout"" or even a perk because it only gives CPS what every other school district already has. And Rauner clearly had sought previously to bargain CPS pension help for other, statewide pension reforms. He got a major one in the budget lawmakers enacted July 6. Numbers are sure to fly fast and furious as Rauner and lawmakers duke this out in Springfield in the days ahead, but we find Rauner’s  generalization that SB 1 is a ""bailout"" for Chicago schools to be False.  ",/factchecks/2017/aug/01/bruce-rauner/rauners-chicago-schools-bailout-claim-rooted-polit/

In the case of Dontre Hamilton, did Milwaukee police shoot a man for resting in a park?
","On the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on June 29, 2017, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, declared: Dontre Hamilton ""was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee."" Is that what happened? The incident can be viewed in at least two different ways. Literally speaking, Hamilton was not killed simply for resting on a bench. He was shot after striking an officer with the officer’s baton. But in making a rhetorical point, Moore is correct that Hamilton had done nothing to attract the attention of police but fall asleep in a park. And the fatal shooting occurred after two other officers had twice observed Hamilton and determined he was doing nothing wrong.   Moore’s comments Moore took to the House floor to promote a bill she introduced three days earlier. Under the measure, states and localities receiving certain federal grants would have to require their law enforcement officers to undergo training on ""de-escalation techniques to assist in reducing the need for the use of force"" by officers. She made her claim about Hamilton after arguing that her bill should be made law before summer ends, saying: We know that kids are out of school and that the tensions in our streets are high. Police on alert, and far too many of us are distrustful of the police due to the painful and frightful memories of how many deadly encounters have dominated headlines -- close to a thousand in one year.  How can this Congress recess for the summer and not take up this bill? Yes, the Affordable Care Act is a big issue here before us in Congress. But if you live in communities of color around the country, the immediate health care issue for you is being shot by a police officer who has been sworn to protect you.  If you die at age 12, like Tamir Rice, who was shot by police for playing with his sister on a playground in Cleveland, how can you be concerned with the Medicaid? If you’re killed at 31 years old like Dontre Hamilton, who was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee, nursing home care is not your priority. You won’t have the fortune of living that long.   Her office did not respond to our requests for information for this fact check. The Hamilton incident Hillary Clinton injected the Hamilton incident into the 2016 presidential campaign. At a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders in Milwaukee, she said Hamilton was ""unarmed"" when he was killed. Our rating was Mostly True. Hamilton, a 31-year-old diagnosed with schizophrenia, had a history of contacts with Milwaukee police, but no convictions for any violent crimes. He was shot to death by Christopher Manney, a Milwaukee officer who worked in the downtown area, on April 30, 2014. Manney was fired -- not for the fatal shooting itself, but for the way he approached Hamilton, which led to a scuffle. Here’s a summary of the incident from our Clinton fact check, based on a report by the Milwaukee County district attorney: First call: Shortly before 2 p.m., an employee at the Starbucks located in Red Arrow Park downtown called police about Hamilton, who was sleeping in the park. The call was classified as a ""welfare check"" -- in other words, to check if Hamilton was OK. A desk sergeant called Manney’s cell phone and left a voicemail message, saying he wanted Manney to go to the park about ""a homeless guy sleeping"" there. Two officers respond: Because Manney didn’t immediately respond to the voicemail, the Starbucks call was referred to a dispatcher, who then dispatched two other officers to the park. They found Hamilton lying on his back with his eyes closed. They nudged Hamilton, he got up and provided identification and said he was taking a nap and was all right. The officers left. Second call: About 2:10 p.m., another call to police about Hamilton came from Starbucks. The two officers returned and told the employees that Hamilton was not doing anything wrong. The officers left shortly before 3 p.m. Manney responds: Just before 3:30 p.m., about 90 minutes after the first call, Manney listened to the voicemail. He called dispatch and asked if there was an assignment for Red Arrow Park. Told there was not, Manney asked ""that he be recorded as responding to a trouble with subject"" call, and he went to the park. He apparently was not aware the other officers had preceded him.

Fight occurs: Manney approached Hamilton, who was lying down, helped him up and then began to pat him down. Hamilton resisted. Witnesses told police that Manney, who was yelling commands at Hamilton, struck Hamilton one or more times with his baton before Hamilton took the baton and struck Manney with it one or more times.

Manney shoots Hamilton: The witnesses said Hamilton was holding the baton -- one said menacingly -- when Manney fired his service weapon. He fired 14 times, resulting in 15 gunshot wounds to Hamilton. In announcing Manney’s firing, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said Manney decided Hamilton was dangerous ""based solely on observations of apparent mental illness, absent any overt actions on the part of Mr. Hamilton."" Our rating Moore says Hamilton ""was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee."" Two officers twice responded to calls about Hamilton sleeping in the park and allowed him to continue sleeping there and left. He was still resting there when a different officer later and arrived and began patting him down. That triggered a physical altercation, with the officer hitting Hamilton with his baton and then Hamilton taking the baton and striking the officer. The officer then fatally shot Hamilton 14 times. In short, Hamilton was not shot simply for resting on a park bench. But the shooting occurred only because of a physical altercation that was sparked by the way the third officer began patting Hamilton down -- after two officers who came to the park twice decided Hamilton wasn’t doing anything wrong. In fact, the officer was fired for the way he approached Hamilton. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.   Hamilton shooting aftermath Manney fired: In October 2014, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn announced he had fired Manney -- not for use of excessive force when he shot Hamilton, but because he did not follow department rules for dealing with emotionally disturbed people in the moments leading up to the shooting. $2.3 million settlement: In May 2017, more than three years after Hamilton’s death, the Milwaukee Common Council approved paying $2.3 million to Hamilton’s young son to settle a federal civil rights lawsuit. Use of deadly force fact check: Flynn said in June 2016 that Milwaukee police use deadly force at a rate that is ""among the lowest"" in the country. Our rating was Half True. The best data available then showed Milwaukee police killed one person in 2015. But 2015 was the only full year for which data were available on a national level, so it wasn’t known how Milwaukee’s rate would compare in prior years.",/factchecks/2017/aug/01/gwen-moore/case-dontre-hamilton-did-milwaukee-police-shoot-ma/

Donald Trump says 'business spirit' is highest it's ever been, but proof is lacking
","Right after swearing in his new chief of staff, President Donald Trump once again touted some of the economic accomplishments during his six months in office. This time, Trump included a metric he referred to as ""business spirit."" ""Business spirit is the highest it's ever been, according to polls,"" Trump said. ""If you look at the polls, (it’s) the highest it's ever been in the history of these polls."" Never having heard of a measurement called ""business spirit,"" we asked the White House for the name of the poll or polls in question. The press office did not get back to us. However, we found a few polls that seem to fit the bill, so we’ll use those to analyze Trump’s statement. The Business Roundtable, a group of corporate CEOs, has released a CEO Economic Outlook Survey on a quarterly basis since the fourth quarter of 2002. The survey is ""designed to provide a picture of the future direction of the U.S. economy by asking CEOs to report their company’s sales expectations and plans for capex spending and hiring in the next six months,"" according to the group. Here’s the historical data:  The index’s current level is reasonably high at 93.9. But the survey has shown a higher rating in 16 earlier quarters, or about 29 percent of the quarters since the survey began. So using this data, it isn’t accurate to say that the business outlook is ""higher than it’s ever been."" The National Federation of Independent Business has been releasing its index of small-business optimism on a monthly basis since 1986. The survey questions selected small business owners who belong to the organization. The current index level is 103.6. Here’s the data since 1986:  The chart shows that while the index is relatively high at the moment, it was higher for periods in 2004 and 2005. It has also fallen since Trump took office. It peaked at 105.9 in January 2017, right as Trump was taking office and has fallen consistently. The survey data, the group said, indicates that ""economic growth in the first half of this year will be about the same as we have experienced for the past three or four years, no real progress. There isn’t much euphoria in the outlook for the second half of the year."" The Institute for Supply Management surveys purchasing executives at some 300 companies on a monthly basis. The number for June was 57.8, which was up 2.9 points since May. However, you don’t have to look too far in the past for a number higher than June’s -- in August 2014, the measurement registered 57.9 percent. YPO is an organization of 24,000 CEOs that publishes studies of business confidence around the world. Here is the data for its survey of the United States since 2009:  This is probably the strongest piece of evidence for Trump’s assertion, as the current level is essentially the highest the survey has found since 2009. However, today’s level is not unprecedented -- it hit essentially the same level three times under President Barack Obama. These four surveys all broadly fit the category of business surveys. There’s another kind of survey, as well -- consumer confidence surveys, which are asked of ordinary Americans rather than business owners. These don’t fit Trump’s description, but it’s worth taking a look. They describe how ordinary Americans feel about the economy. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index is probably the most widely tracked study of consumer confidence, published either monthly or quarterly since 1967. The current level of 121.1 is relatively high, but it was exceeded for almost all of the stretch between May 1997 and November 2000, when Bill Clinton was president, as well as a stretch between 1967 and 1969, when Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon were president. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is similar in format to the board’s consumer confidence index and its results are similar. Here is the data going back to 1978. Finally, the polling firm Gallup surveys approximately 1,500 adults nationally to come up with its Economic Confidence Index. Confidence did peak under Trump in this survey, but as with other measurements, it has fallen during his time in office.    ""Though Americans remain optimistic about the state of the economy, this sentiment is not as strong as it was in the weeks just before and after Donald Trump's presidential inauguration,"" Gallup wrote July 25. In addition to pointing out the difference between business confidence and consumer confidence, we should make clear that high levels of confidence are not the same thing as high levels of economic activity. Surveys that measure either business or consumer confidence measure something intangible -- how someone feels and what they think they will do in the future. It’s not necessarily dependent on past or current performance, and confidence levels can go up or down untethered to actual economic results. Trump said, ""Business spirit is the highest it's ever been, according to polls."" Current levels of business confidence, as measured by regular surveys of executives, are relatively high at the moment, but they are not the highest ever -- and in several that are taken on a monthly basis, they have fallen since Trump took office. The statement is a significant exaggeration, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/jul/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-business-spirit-highest-its-ever/

J.K. Rowling falsely accuses Trump of not shaking disabled boy's hand

Trump invited the family of 3-year-old Monty Weer to the White House on July 24, 2017, while the president gave a speech on health care reform. Monty Weer has spina bifida, a birth defect in which the spinal cord is not completely formed. He is confined to a wheelchair and requires medical treatment, but Trump said the Weer family’s options were limited because there is only one choice of health insurance provider where they live in South Carolina. Trump said there weren’t more options because of the Affordable Care Act. (The family also has acknowledged parts of the law have helped them, too.) A video circulated on the Internet after Trump’s speech, showing Trump not shaking Monty Weer’s hand as Trump walked by. The original has since been deleted, but you can watch a similar video here: Rowling saw the video and retweeted it, then tweeted several more times about her anger over the apparent snub.

Except that the unedited White House video showed that Trump did greet the boy, bending down to speak to him as he walked up to the podium (starting at about 2:18 in the video below): Twitter users attacked Rowling for her ire, demanding she delete the tweets and apologize to Trump, whom she regularly attacks on the social media site.

We tried to contact her through her publicist’s email but did not get a response. (Editor's note: After publication, Rowling deleted the tweets and apologized to the boy and his family. See the After the Fact below for more.) British journalist Piers Morgan was one of the more outspoken critics, posting numerous times that Rowling had lied about Trump. (He also attacked Chelsea Clinton, who had been fooled by the same edited video but later acknowledged her mistake.) Morgan posted an image being spread on the Internet of a Facebook status attributed to Monty Weer’s mother, Marjorie Weer, addressing Rowling and saying ""Trump didn’t snub my son & Monty wasn’t even trying to shake his hand."" The image said ""hand shaking is not his thing"" because he’s so young and that ""he was showing off his newly acquired secret service patch."" We traced the image to a July 30 Reddit post, but couldn’t independently verify that Marjorie Weer had actually written it on Facebook. Rowling said Trump was seen ""looking deliberately over a disabled child's head, ignoring his outstretched hand."" Her tweets were based on an edited video of a White House press conference that had circulated online. The full video of the event showed Trump did greet a 3-year-old boy with spina bifida.

N.H. governor calls New York, California the biggest polluters
","Gov. Chris Sununu says he’s proud of his state’s record of environmental stewardship. The Republican says New Hampshire will take care of its natural resources with or without a demand from Paris or Washington, D.C. When he was asked whether he’d sign onto the United States Climate Alliance – a state-level agreement to uphold the objectives of the Paris climate accord developed after the U.S. withdrew from the latter – he bristled. In an interview with New Hampshire Public Radio, Sununu said the climate alliance is ""quasi-meaningless"" and ""more of just a political statement than anything."" He specifically called out its founders, the governors of California and New York, saying their motive in championing the U.S. Climate Alliance was to distract from their states’ shortcomings. ""That piece of paper that folks wanted me to sign – think about where it came from,"" Sununu told the public radio station. ""It came from the governors of New York and California, the two biggest polluting states in the country."" PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to take a closer look at the biggest polluting states in the country. Clarifying the statement Sununu made the statement in response to a listener’s question about climate change and the Paris accord, which suggests that his ""biggest polluting states"" remark was a reference to carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions. But he also discussed other types of pollution. Before he was the CEO of a ski mountain or the governor, Sununu received a degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in civil and environmental engineering and worked as an environmental engineer cleaning up waste sites. He said he brings ""more environmental experience to the governor’s office than any governor in the history of the state."" His work cleaning up hazardous waste sites in California showed him first-hand, he said, ""It’s deplorable what they’ve done in parts of that state – or New York up in some of those rivers."" So what exactly is the measure he’s using to define the ""biggest polluting states?"" Carbon dioxide? Greenhouse gases in general? Other air pollutants? Water pollutants? We asked his press secretary, Ben Vihstadt, for data to support the claim. Vihstadt cited a study by the Energy Information Administration, a division of the U.S. Department of Energy, that specifically looks at energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. The data The study that Vihstadt cited shows state-by-state data collected as recently as 2014. In his email, he softened the governor’s original claim, saying instead that the study showed California and New York ""are two of the top polluting states in the country"" – not the top two. With its 642 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted in 2014, Texas is head and shoulders above the rest of the country. It was responsible for 11.9 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions covered in the study. And Texas had nothing at all to do with the Climate Alliance letter. California, one of our subjects, comes in at No. 2 with 358 million tons, or 6.6 percent of the total. New York is No. 9 with 170 million tons, or 3.1 percent. By comparison, New Hampshire is 46th on this list, with a measly 15 million tons that represent less than 0.3 percent of the total. It’s worth noting that California and New York have been effectively reducing their carbon dioxide emissions over time, according to the EIA study. Texas’s annual emissions are 14 percent higher than they were in 1990, but California and New York each emitted lower amounts of carbon dioxide in 2014 than they did in 1990. New York’s 2014 emissions were 21 percent lower than the state’s 2004 peak. So both the states we’re investigating are near the top on this scale. But we reached out to a handful of researchers and professors in environmental science who urged us to consider the question in other ways. ""In general, California and New York are among the largest states, so the absolute numbers will be large for them,"" said Sergey Paltsev, a senior research scientist for the MIT Energy Initiative and MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. Brian Soden, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Miami, suggested analyzing carbon dioxide emissions per capita or per gross domestic product to equalize population and production differences between states. Per capita The same Energy Information Administration study also breaks down the data on a per-capita basis, as the scientists recommended. In this view, California and New York – the first and third most populous states – are at the complete other end of the spectrum. Of the 51 states, including Washington, D.C., California and New York have the second and third lowest per-capita energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. The EIA study notes: ""Many factors contribute to variation in the amount of emissions per capita, including climate, the structure of the state economy, population density, energy sources, building standards and explicit state policies to reduce emissions."" Wyoming earns its No. 1 per-capita rank by being the least populous state and the second-largest energy producer, the EIA study says. New York, on the other hand, had fewer than one-tenth the carbon dioxide emissions per-capita compared with Wyoming. ""A large portion of the population is located in the New York City metropolitan area where mass transit is readily available and most residences are multi-family units that provide efficiencies of scale in terms of energy for heating and cooling. The New York economy is oriented towards low-energy-consuming activities such as financial markets,"" the study says, adding, ""New York's energy prices are relatively high ... which in turn encourages energy savings."" In addition to being low carbon dioxide emitters per capita, California and New York are also among the lowest carbon dioxide emitters relative to gross domestic product. New Hampshire, by comparison, is the 12th lowest emitter on a per-capita basis and 11th lowest relative to GDP. Our ruling Sununu said California and New York are ""the two biggest polluting states in the country."" His press secretary tried to soften the claim, but no matter how you look at it, that’s not accurate. In terms of absolute carbon dioxide emissions, California and New York rank No. 2 and No. 9. Texas is No. 1. Adjusting for population and GDP, California and New York are actually among the most effective states at reducing their impact on the atmosphere – beating even Sununu’s home state of New Hampshire. It turns out, Sununu was just blowing smoke. We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/jul/28/chris-sununu/nh-governor-calls-new-york-california-biggest-poll/

Fake tweet said Obama hoped McCain would die from brain tumor
","A fake news story that claimed former President Barack Obama tweeted that he wanted U.S. Sen. John McCain to die from a brain tumor originally came from a parody website looking to troll conservatives. The headline on a July 20, 2017, post on DailyThings.world read, ""Barack Obama tweets sick attack on John McCain, says he should have died."" Facebook users flagged the story here and on NewsFeedHunter.com as being potentially fabricated, in an effort to cut down on fake news. The story included an image of a July 19 tweet from Obama that read, ""John McCain is NOT a war hero. If there were any God in heaven, he would have died from that brain tumor."" The post said Obama quickly deleted the tweet. The story came on the heels of the announcement that McCain, R-Ariz., was diagnosed with a brain tumor called a primary glioblastoma. The American Brain Tumor Association said that a 2009 study showed almost 10 percent of patients may potentially live five years or longer. The 80-year-old is considering treatment options. McCain returned to the U.S. Senate for votes on Republican health care reform, most recently casting a deciding vote against a last-ditch ""skinny repeal"" bill to end the Affordable Care Act. But let’s be clear: This story is completely fake. There was no such tweet for Obama to delete. It was no doubt the product of any number of websites that allow you to create a fake tweet that appears to come from another account. The only thing Obama tweeted on July 19 were words of encouragement for McCain, whom Obama defeated in the 2008 presidential election. ""John McCain is an American hero & one of the bravest fighters I've ever known. Cancer doesn't know what it's up against. Give it hell, John,"" Obama wrote.

The Inland Empire: Second only to San Francisco in California job growth?
","California’s workforce of 19 million is spread across distinct metro regions, from tech-heavy Silicon Valley to the agricultural powerhouses of Fresno and Bakersfield, to the movie studios of Los Angeles. Less talked about are the nearly two million who work in the state’s Inland Empire. It’s home to more than 4.5 million people in sprawling San Bernardino and Riverside counties east of Los Angeles. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democratic candidate for governor, recently claimed this region of high desert and valley communities is among the leaders in California job growth. The Inland Empire is ""the second fastest growing region"" in California, Newsom said in an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on July 12, 2017.  ""It’s about logistics, warehousing, transportation.""  Newsom makes his claim at about the 2:00 minute mark above.  We took Newsom’s statement to mean the Inland Empire has the state’s second fastest job growth rate because the lieutenant governor went on to talk about statewide job growth immediately after making this claim. Newsom’s comments follow Gov. Jerry Brown’s recent claim on NBC’s Meet the Press that California’s Central Valley and Inland Empire ""are experiencing tremendous job growth."" We examined that claim and rated it Mostly True. Still, we wondered whether Newsom was right. We set out on a fact check. Our research Asked for evidence to support the claim, Newsom’s spokesman cited research from John Husing, chief economist with the Inland Empire Economic Partnership. The industry group advocates for jobs creation in the region. The spokesman specifically pointed to a section of Husing’s April 2017 report that found the Inland Empire’s ""3.47% growth rate in 2016 was second to San Francisco (4.16%)."" The report went on to say the region added the second most total jobs of any in the state, 47,500, behind Los Angeles’ 109,000 and ahead of San Francisco’s 43,800. These figures back up Newsom’s claim. His statement also holds when looking at job growth rates over the past five years. In April 2017, Jeffrey Michael, director of the Center for Business and Policy Research at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, compiled data showing job growth rates by metro area. The Inland Empire had the fastest job growth rate over the past year at that time, 3.2 percent, and the second fastest rate, 22.3 percent, over the past five years. The economists analyzed data from the California Employment Development Department.  Types of jobs Newsom’s claim about the rapid pace of job growth appears on the money. But what about the type of jobs he described: ""logistics, warehousing, transportation"" ? Husing told us this description was also on the right track. With the explosion of e-commerce, developers have seized on the Inland Empire’s vast and affordable stretches of land to build warehouses for products shipped through ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach. More than 60,600 distribution and transportation jobs have been added in the Inland Empire since its rebound from the Great Recession in 2010, Husing said. In addition, nearly 46,000 construction jobs; about 25,000 healthcare jobs and 15,000 manufacturing positions have been created. Logistics, transportation and construction ""are overwhelmingly the sectors that are driving the growth,"" the economist said. Husing described most of these positions as ""blue collar jobs."" In April, Husing described in more depth the Inland Empire’s wage picture. He said it had a lower share of high-paying administrative jobs compared with the state as a whole. But, he said, the region was outperforming the state in its share of middle-class jobs that pay between $45,000 and $60,000. Our ruling Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently claimed the Inland Empire is ""the second fastest growing region"" in California. We took Newsom’s claim to mean it has the second fastest job growth rate. Data compiled by two leading economists back up Newsom’s assertion. It shows the Inland Empire’s nearly 3.5 percent jobs growth rate in 2016 was second only to San Francisco’s 4.16 percent. Figures over the past five years show the Inland Empire grew jobs at 22.3 percent, again second only to the San Francisco market.   The lieutenant governor was also correct to describe these Inland Empire jobs as based in the transportation and distribution sectors, based on data from the economists. We rate Newsom’s claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

Scott Walker says Foxconn 'bringing' 13,000 jobs to Wisconsin -- what exactly does that mean?
","Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker could perhaps be excused for over-exuberance when it comes to Foxconn Technology Group, the Taiwan-based company that describes itself as the world's largest electronics manufacturing services provider. Indeed, the typically composed Republican governor seemed almost giddy when he joined President Donald Trump, Foxconn founder Terry Gou and other officials at the White House on July 26, 2017. The occasion: Foxconn was announcing that, after considering a number of states, it had decided to build a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel manufacturing plant in southeast Wisconsin. Not just any plant, but a $10 billion facility that is envisioned as becoming part of a high-tech ""ecosystem.""     So, in all the excitement, did Walker go too far in stating how many jobs are coming? In a tweet the same day, he declared: Foxconn is bringing 13,000 high-tech jobs to Wisconsin -- the biggest jobs announcement in our state’s history! Leaving aside the term high-tech, we wondered about the figure. We found that the 13,000 is something more than a goal, though -- at this stage -- considerably less than actual jobs. What Foxconn says At the White House, Gou made no reference to the number of jobs the facility would create. And in a news release, Foxconn was notably more measured than Walker was, using the word ""potential"" in saying the plant would ""create 3,000 jobs with the potential to grow to 13,000 new jobs."" Trump used the same word, saying 3,000 jobs would be created ""at a minimum, with the potential for up to 13,000 jobs in the very near future."" Indeed, in an interview on the day of the announcement, Walker himself qualified the 13,000 figure as less than certain in discussing $3 billion in incentives Wisconsin is offering Foxconn. ""If there’s something less than the 13,000 jobs, they don’t get as much of an incentive,"" he told WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee.   (Walker repeated that point in three broadcast interviews the next day, making it clear the company would not get the full $1.5 billion jobs portion of the incentives unless 13,000 jobs are created.) It’s fair to say that the 13,000 is something more than a goal, given that Foxconn is entering into a written agreement with the state. ""Is there an absolute guarantee that there will be 13,000 jobs? I don’t know how Foxconn could guarantee that,"" said Tom Still, president of the Wisconsin Technology Council, a nonprofit that advises the governor and the Legislature. ""But is there a strategic plan to grow to that level? Absolutely."" At the same time, much must occur before any help wanted postings are made. It’s worth noting that in 2013, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett announced that Foxconn planned to invest $30 million in a ""high-end technology manufacturing facility"" with 500 jobs. The company has a small research operation in Harrisburg, Pa., but the factory was never built. And by way of comparison, on the same day of Foxconn’s Wisconsin announcement, Amazon made a more firm jobs announcement. It said it would hold a job fair on Aug. 2, 2017, at 10 of its shipping sites around the country as part of an effort to fill more than 50,000 U.S. jobs. Our rating Walker said: ""Foxconn is bringing 13,000 high-tech jobs to Wisconsin."" Leaving aside the term high-tech, the Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer is a long way from even breaking ground on a plant that was only announced the same day Walker made his statement. And the company itself has been more measured, saying the planned plant initially will create 3,000 jobs, ""with the potential to grow to 13,000 new jobs."" But the 13,000 is more than talk. Foxconn is pledging a $10 billion investment and the state is offering $3 billion in incentives, with $1.5 billion aimed at the creation of 13,000 jobs. Walker’s statement is partially accurate, but needs clarification -- our definition of Half True.",/factchecks/2017/jul/27/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-foxconn-bringing-13000-jobs-wisc/

Is it a felony to leak a financial disclosure form, as Anthony Scaramucci said?
","Anthony Scaramucci, the new White House communications director, called for a full-blown federal investigation of leaks in a tweet. ""In light of the leak of my financial disclosure info which is a felony,"" he wrote on Twitter, ""I will be contacting @FBI and the @TheJusticeDept #swamp @Reince45"" He later deleted the tweet. The White House did not provide information for this fact-check. First, it’s important to note that the financial disclosure was a public record, not secret information. Second, Scaramucci’s financial disclosure form wasn’t leaked. It was available upon request from Scaramucci’s former employer, the Export-Import Bank, as of July 23, 2017, or 30 days after it was filed. This is how Lorraine Woellert, the Politico reporter who broke the story, got it. ""My source for @Scaramucci financials was Ex-Im Bank. Period."" My source for @Scaramucci financials was Ex-Im Bank. Period. https://t.co/seNUtnwQoz The Export-Import Bank confirmed Woellert put in a request to their ethics office and said that any reporter was welcome to put in the same request. When the New York Times asked Scaramucci why he thought the report had been leaked, he said, ""They aren’t in process yet,"" but didn’t elaborate. He did not respond when told the form could be released as of July 23. Scaramucci’s claim the leak was a felony would be off even if, as he seemed to believe, the 30-day period had not yet ended. Law experts told us that criminal statutes apply only to those who leak nonpublic national security information, like classified information or the identity of undercover agents, for theft of government property. The government has pursued such cases multiple times. However, Scaramucci’s financial disclosure forms were not of relevance to national security. There are also laws on computer privacy that aren’t limited to classified information. According to James Hoopes, Murata Professor of Business Ethics at Babson College, it may have been a felony if the financial disclosure form was obtained by hacking a computer, which it wasn’t. There are also statutes that criminalize certain disclosures, such as the disclosure of tax returns, enacted after President Richard Nixon used these to go after his political enemies. But there’s no such statute for financial disclosure forms. Disclosures of personal information could potentially form the basis of a civil suit for violation of the Privacy Act, according to Kathleen Clark, a legal ethics expert and law professor at Washington University. The Privacy Act says that agencies can’t disclose records that are contained in a system of records without the consent of the individual. But even that wouldn’t constitute a felony, and the time the record was to be contained had expired. Scaramucci acknowledged the weakness of his original legal claim to Chris Cuomo on CNN, but he stayed on message with regards to leaks. ""I understand the law. I know that there was a public disclosure mechanism in my financial forms,"" Scaramucci said. ""What I'm upset about is the process and the junk pool, the dirty pool, Chris, in terms of the way this stuff is being done, and the leaking won't stop."" Some reporters posited that Scaramucci’s inclusion of White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus’ handle in the tweet was an accusation of having produced the leak. After deleting the original tweet, Scaramucci wrote another tweet to correct the record and again tagged Priebus. ""Wrong! Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks. @Reince45"". Wrong! Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks. @Reince45 pic.twitter.com/AB0reseuX1 Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores responded to Scaramucci’s original tweeted request that the Justice Department launch a federal investigation into leaks. ‘We have seen an astonishing increase in the number of leaks of classified national security information in recent months,"" Isgur Flores said in a press release. ""We agree with Anthony that these staggering number of leaks are undermining the ability of our government to function and to protect this country. Like the Attorney General has said, ‘whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail,’ and we will aggressively pursue leak cases wherever they may lead."" The FBI did not respond to our request for comment on Scaramucci’s call to action, but directed our question of whether a leak of financial disclosure forms constituted a felony to the Justice Department. The Justice Department did not respond. Scaramucci called the leak of his financial disclosure form a felony in a tweet that he later deleted. He was incorrect in calling the publishing of his form a leak, as it was a public document provided to the Politico reporter by the Export-Import Bank after the required 30 days of his filing. Even if it had been provided earlier, though, experts told us the leak of financial disclosure information wouldn’t be considered a felony, unless someone had hacked the system to obtain it.

Was Barack Obama's best economic year worse than Bill Clinton's weakest?
","How bad was the economy under President Barack Obama? Pretty bad, argues former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. In economic growth, ""Obama's best year was slower than Bill Clinton's worst year,"" Gingrich told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on July 23, 2017. ""That's astonishing."" We’ve previously looked at why it’s so hard these days for the United States to sustain 3 percent annual economic growth — a benchmark President Donald Trump says the country can again reach with his leadership. But we wondered whether the difference in economic performance under the two most recent Democratic presidents was so stark. We found that Gingrich’s talking point is correct, though he leaves out some important context. Annual economic growth is typically measured by the change, up or down, in gross domestic product from year to year, after adjusting for inflation. This data is collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a federal office. As it turns out, Clinton had two years tied for last place -- 1993 and 1995. In both years, GDP grew by 2.7 percent. As for Obama, his best annual showing came in 2015, with 2.6 percent. In the following chart, the worst Clinton years and the best Obama year are marked in blue. So by the primary measure, Gingrich’s statement is correct. However, it’s worth noting that a related statistic shows the record on Obama’s watch in a somewhat more favorable light. Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said that GDP growth depends on two major factors -- how productive workers are, and how many workers there are. And Clinton was blessed with a worker population that was growing much faster than it later would under Obama. When Clinton was president, Burtless said, the population between the ages of 15 and 64 increased by 1.2 percent a year. Under Obama, the increase was just 0.6 percent. ""So it seems to me a bit absurd to compare overall GDP growth in the two administrations without somehow accounting for the different rates of growth in the population,"" Burtless said. It’s possible to use a variant on our previous metric — GDP growth per capita — that lessens this problem. Here’s what that measurement looks like: Using this measurement, Obama exceeded Clinton’s worst annual performance during four years (2010, 2012, 2014, 2015). In other words, while Clinton still did better overall when population growth is taken into account, the Obama administration had a better experience using this metric than is implied by Gingrich's statement, Burtless said. Gingrich’s office did not reply to an inquiry. Gingrich said that in economic growth, ""Obama's best year was slower than Bill Clinton's worst year."" Measured by the annual change in inflation-adjusted GDP -- the typical measurement -- Gingrich is correct. But it’s worth noting that if you strip out the impact of population growth, the Clinton-Obama comparison is more mixed. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/jul/27/newt-gingrich/was-barack-obamas-best-economic-year-worse-bill-cl/

Beto O'Rourke claims near-uniqueness in not taking corporate or PAC contributions
","U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, the punk rocker turned Democratic politician from El Paso, vowed to go against ""politics as usual"" in Washington while spreading the word about his quest to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in the 2018 elections. O’Rourke, addressing Dallas supporters at a March 2017 campaign kickoff event, provided some detail as to what that means to him. Toward the end of his remarks, he asked for personal campaign donations, adding to cheers and applause: ""I’m one of two members of Congress out of 535 that takes no corporate cash, no political action committee money. I don’t want you worried that when I’m taking a vote, making a decision, writing a bill, looking at an amendment, that I’m listening to anyone but you, the people that I want to serve and that I want to represent."" Nobody seeking federal office can legally accept direct corporate or union donations, the Federal Election Commission notes. Yet political action committees--open to anyone’s contributions or founded and run by individuals working for corporations or affiliated with labor unions, membership organizations or trade associations--routinely fuel campaigns. In the 2016 elections, PACs gave $472.7 million to congressional candidates, according to the campaign finance tracking website OpenSecrets.org run by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. According to the site, PAC donations accounted for 35 percent of campaign funds for House Democrats, 39 percent for House Republicans, 15 percent for Senate Democrats and 27 percent for Senate Republicans. O’Rourke amends We inquired into the basis of O’Rourke’s claim to near-uniqueness for not taking PAC money. By email, O’Rourke replied that he’d revise what he says going forward. ""What I should have said,"" O’Rourke said, ""is that there are only two members of Congress who do not take PAC money and who also do not have a leadership PAC (which gives PAC contributions to other members), myself and Ro Khanna,"" a California Democrat. In a March 2017 press release, Khanna said he and O’Rourke had introduced legislation barring members of Congress and aspirants from accepting PAC donations. That release grouped Khanna and O’Rourke among six House members who didn’t accept PAC donations in the run-up to the 2016 elections. That count was  based, the release said, on a December 2016 breakdown of candidate finance filings posted by Colorado-based CleanSlateNow, which focuses on changing how campaigns are funded. O’Rourke’s reply to us included a different count attributed to information on the OpenSecrets site. O’Rourke wrote: ""There are four members of Congress (based on the Open Secrets website) who did not take PAC money in the last cycle (either to their Congressional campaign or to their leadership PAC if they had one) -- myself, Ro Khanna, John Sarbanes and Francis Rooney. Both Sarbanes and Rooney have PACs themselves that make PAC contributions to other candidates."" Reviewing web posts and records Information on the OpenSecrets site indicates that into May 2017, Cruz had raised more than $1.9 million from PACs with the contributions accounting for 2 percent of more than $117 million he’d raised starting from his 2012 election to the Senate. The comparable entry for O’Rourke doesn’t show a zero for his PAC donations. It indicates instead $297,969 in PAC contributions to O’Rourke campaigns, amounting to 5 percent of O’Rourke’s $6.3 million in contributions since 2011, the year before his initial election to the House. We asked O’Rourke’s campaign about the tallied PAC contributions. A senior adviser, David Wysong, said by phone that O’Rourke accepted such donations through his first couple of House elections but stopped doing so before seeking his third term in 2016. By email, Wysong provided a document he described as a February 2015 form letter from O’Rourke to possible PAC contributors after which, Wysong said, O’Rourke accepted no PAC donations. From O’Rourke’s letter: ""Starting with this election cycle, I plan to no longer accept PAC contributions. I've made this decision in an effort to focus more of my campaign efforts on bringing new, smaller and local donors into the campaign."" Wysong also emailed an example of O'Rourke turning back such such aid--an October 2016 letter from O’Rourke’s campaign manager, Brianna Carmen, returning a donation from the Treasury Employees PAC. Wysong noted too that according to an FEC summary page about O’Rourke’s Senate finance report filed in July 2017, the candidate raised more than $2 million from April through June 2017, none of that from PACs. Banana peels With help from the center’s research director, Sarah Bryner, we confirmed from the OpenSecrets site and FEC filings that O’Rourke did not bank any PAC contributions as he sought re-election in 2016 or in the first months of his Senate bid. But this proved a slog to confirm because PAC names repeatedly appear in O’Rourke’s contribution reports. His July 2017 filing with the FEC separately shows $14,580 in contributions from other candidate committees. How unique? Our first focus was on gauging the accuracy of O’Rourke’s claim to being one of two members not accepting PAC aid. After identifying each current senator and House member on the U.S. Congress website, we checked the OpenSecrets site for PAC contributions to each member; the site provides a summary page for each member showing her or his contributions by cycle and over the years. Candidate contributions are further broken down by categories including individual contributions, PAC contributions and self-financing. Here’s the site’s entry for O’Rourke covering the 2016 election cycle: SOURCE: Summary for Beto O’Rourke, OpenSecrets.org (accessed May 10, 2017) From OpenSecrets posts, we identified five House members who did not get PAC contributions before the 2016 elections: O’Rourke; Khanna; Sarbanes, D-Md.; Jared Polis, D-Colo; Rooney, R-Fla--with Polis, Khanna and Rooney also fielding no PAC aid in their House careers. A conflict we didn't settle: CleanSlateNow previously identified Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., as not getting PAC help in his 2016 re-election bid. In contrast, Roe’s OpenSecrets summary page for Roe indicates he got $6,000 in PAC donations before that election. Next, we eyeballed FEC-posted information, focusing on campaign filings by House members’ principal campaign committees for 2015-16. These records confirmed Khanna did not get PAC contributions that cycle. Otherwise, the records showed, Rooney received a $10,296 PAC contribution from Rooney Victory on Dec. 30, 2016; Sarbanes received donations from the VoteSANE PAC; and Polis logged contributions attributed to JStreetPAC, AmeriPAC and ActBlue. Similarly, our FEC search suggested that O’Rourke’s campaign in 2015-16 received $110,721 attributed to PACs (including ActBlue, JStreetPAC and the New Democrat Coalition PAC). Of this total, $74,400 in contributions were designated for the 2018 Democratic primary. So, candidates including O'Rourke took PAC aid? Not so, we found, in that the donations were almost uniformly made by individuals whose personal contribution were routed through supportive ""conduit"" PACs--a phrase we hadn’t heard before. It looked to us like the donation to Rooney came from a committee devoted to his candidacy. On the FEC site, the respective 2016 donations marked as ""PAC"" to Sarbanes, O’Rourke and Polis were each accompanied by a column describing the donations as a ""conduit total,"" with a note stating the donation was ""earmarked through this organization."" We sought more information about ActBlue, the largest aggregator of individual contributions among the PACs linked to O’Rourke. The group says on its web site that it offers tools to help Democratic candidates but it’s not a traditional PAC that rounds up donations and obscures specific donors. ActBlue says it ""acts as a conduit federally and in most states, which means we provide the infrastructure for campaigns and organizations to fundraise online, but we don’t fundraise on behalf of anyone. Unlike groups that spend large sums of cash from undisclosed sources, ActBlue offers grassroots donors a way to give fully disclosed donations to the candidates and causes they choose,"" the group says.

Negative, Bryner told us, saying the charts summarizing O’Rourke’s Senate contributions were erroneous and would be rectified. Significantly, Bryner also showed us how to query an FEC site that provides detailed files about all candidates, parties and other political committees. From the site, we fetched a July 23, 2017 commission list itemizing more than 45,000 PAC contributions to congressional candidates in the 2017-18 election cycle. That list showed no PAC contributions to O’Rourke. Experts concur We asked campaign finance experts to guide us to documentation distinguishing donations through conduit PACs from traditional PAC contributions. Judith Ingram, press officer at the FEC, showed us that in quarterly filings, ActBlue donations present an individual name as a line item below each listing of ActBlue as a donor, along with a text field that explains the individual donation is part of a conduit total. Ingram further confirmed that the JStreet PAC contributions reported by O’Rourke were made by individual donors employing the PAC as a conduit. Stephen Spaulding, chief of strategy at the nonpartisan watchdog group Common Cause, echoed Ingram’s comments--that groups such as ActBlue act as intermediaries by processing payments that ""can be attributed to an actual donor, a human being."" If a donation was a traditional PAC contribution, Spaulding explained, the listed contributor would be the PAC alone, and there wouldn’t be a specific individual’s name linked to it. Our ruling

O’Rourke said: ""I’m one of two members of Congress out of 535 that takes no corporate cash, no political action committee money."" Unsaid: no candidate can take corporate cash; that’s illegal. Otherwise, we found, O’Rourke was one of at least five (not two) House incumbents to keep no PAC contributions in the run-up to the 2016 elections. He also hasn’t accepted PAC aid into 2017 though he drew on about $297,000 in PAC donations in his House bids of 2012 and 2014--actions not recapped in his Dallas call for contributions. We rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Dan Patrick says 32 percent of Texas public school spending goes to teacher salaries
","Dan Patrick framed his case for ordering Texas schools to shift money toward higher teacher salaries by suggesting that less than a third of school spending currently reaches teacher pocketbooks. The Republican lieutenant governor, addressing reporters before the July 2017 start of a special legislative session called by Gov. Greg Abbott, said: ""Of all the money we spend on education, less than 32 percent goes to teachers."" By email, Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia offered as the basis of Patrick’s claim a state publication presenting statistics such as student enrollment. We did not spot information in the document speaking to what Patrick said. Texas Education Agency figures But when we reached out to the Texas Education Agency, spokeswoman Lauren Callahan responded by pointing out state-posted figures for the 2015-16 school year, the latest year of audited spending totals. That year, according to the agency, state government recorded receipts of $58,796,907,294 related to public schools from state, local, federal and other revenue sources. The same year, according to another agency web page, 347,328 teachers were paid combined base salaries of $18,023,516,741, averaging $51,892. That $18 billion breaks out to 31 percent of the nearly $59 billion in total receipts. Some more money went to teachers, though, in nearly $1 million in stipends such as what’s paid to teachers that oversee extracurricular activities, Callahan told us. The resulting total teacher compensation, $19,005,561,634, divides out to 32 percent of the total education receipts. Additional money goes into other salaries. According to the agency, Texas schools in 2015-16 paid more than $24 billion to 68,699 teacher support staff — broken out by TEA into more than 20 job categories including counselors, school nurses and athletic trainers — plus 237,460 administrative, professional, paraprofessional and auxiliary staff — with spending on all employee salaries accounting for more than 70 percent of school-related receipts. Keep in mind, though, Patrick singled out the share of all spending solely devoted to teacher pay. School district advocates When we asked finance experts who advocate for school districts if the equation based on TEA data holds up, we heard back that the math works, but the total-spending figure folds in spending deserving of an asterisk. In emails, Joe Wisnoski, a former TEA finance administrator who advises and lobbies for school districts, and Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials each suggested it’s unfair to compare the $18 billion spent on teacher salaries to total receipts, which count money that doesn’t play into school employee salaries, each expert wrote. Wisnoski suggested it’s more appropriate to compare spending on teacher salaries to operating expenditures, which means not judging the teacher salaries against any money districts raise in bond proceeds or what’s spent on capital projects such as buildings or to pay off debt. Wisnoski noted that none of those funding streams would be available to could be diverted to salaries anyway. According to the TEA’s posted figures for 2015-16, 2015-16 ""all funds"" operating expenditures for schools totaled nearly $49.5 billion --of which the spending on teacher salaries accounted for 36.4 percent, Wisnoski said and we confirmed. ""There are lots of ways to include or exclude things in the world of school district finances,"" Wisnoski said, ""and what is most appropriate somewhat depends on the person making the point and the specific point being made."" Canby called the equation that got us to 32 percent of all spending going to teacher salaries a misleading ""apples divided by oranges calculation."" He said he would gauge the share of spending on teacher salaries, starting from 2016 actual expenditure totals he said he fetched from the state’s Public Education Information Management System. Those figures suggest that teacher salaries cost $19,131,375,774 with benefits adding $3,429,356,293. The resulting $22,560,732,067 accounted for 47.7 percent of $47,303,105,584 in operating expenditures statewide, Canby noted. Canby also emailed us a web link to a July 2017 commentary by TASBO’s executive director, Tracy Ginsburg, stating that the group had been unable to verify numbers aired by Patrick indicating that of $163,000 spent per classroom, $52,000 is paid to classroom teachers. Ginsburg encouraged readers to consider a June 2017 report by Moak, Casey & Associates, the lobbying and consulting firm whose associates include Wisnoski. That report says that in 2015-16, Texas school employee salaries and benefits absorbed 79 percent of $46.4 billion spent on ""basic educational costs."" The share of that spending on teacher salaries alone doesn’t appear in the report, which states that ""instruction"" accounted for 61 percent of basic costs, taking into account some 333,000 teachers plus 63,700 education aides. The ""instruction"" entry in the report says: ""Also included here are the salaries and benefits costs of 4,500 librarians as well as the books and other materials that can be found in Texas school libraries. The cost of instructional materials and staff development are also included in this category as instructional costs."" Our ruling Patrick said: ""Of all the money we spend on education, less than 32 percent goes to teachers."" This percentage, we found, aligns with the simple comparison of total teacher salaries to all funds spent on public schools. But it’s worth clarifying that not all funds can be diverted to teacher salaries. You could also say that close to half of available school spending in 2015-16 went to teacher salaries. We rate the statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Marco Rubio says Florida mandates coverage of more conditions than Obamacare
","Republicans attempting to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, have been met with concerns about whether health insurance will still offer comprehensive coverage under new rules. But U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio says Florida law mandates that insurers cover more essential health benefits than the federal law. ""In Florida, essential health benefits aren't just what the federal government requires, it is what state law requires,"" Rubio said on Facebook Live July 20. Then he continued ""under state law, in order to sell insurance in Florida, there are over 40 separate individual conditions that must be covered. In essence, you cannot sell a health care plan in Florida if you don't cover these things -- far beyond the essential health benefits included in Obamacare. Irrespective of what we do in federal law, we still have to follow the state law, and these plans will still have to go through the state. My point is much of what health insurance in Florida will look like will be determined by the state Legislature. That’s the way it should be."" In Florida, are insurers required to cover more conditions than under President Barack Obama’s signature legislation? A reader emailed the Truth-O-Meter and asked us to check it out, so we did. Rubio has a point -- Florida did have a long list of health care mandates before the federal law passed in 2010. But multiple experts told us that comparing the number of state mandates to the number of essential health benefits in the federal law is not an apples-to-apples comparison. In some ways, the federal protections are more sweeping. Understanding what the laws say about coverage requires reading the fine print. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, every state had its own mandates. Some states had a longer list of mandates than others -- Florida’s list of mandates was long, said Timothy Jost, emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law and a supporter of the federal law. The Affordable Care Act took a different approach: It set 10 coverage ""essential health benefit"" categories for plans sold on the individual and small group markets nationwide. The categories were: Ambulatory patient services; Emergency services; Hospitalization; Maternity and newborn care; Mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; Prescription drugs; Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; Laboratory services; Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and, Pediatric services, including oral and vision care. The federal law is a minimum standard -- states are allowed to provide greater benefits. For example, Florida law requires coverage of adult student dependents until age 30, with some caveats, while the federal law only requires such coverage until age 26. The 10 categories were intentionally broad so states could have flexibility to apply them. As part of the federal law, each state sets a benchmark plan which defines the essential health benefits. While the federal law sets 10 broad categories, Florida lists specific benefits. The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation directed PolitiFact to the benchmark plan, a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan which shows about 34 covered benefits. The first thing we noticed is that the list of benefits has some overlap, so it doesn’t mean that the 34 benefits are three times more than the broader 10 required categories in the federal law. For example, in the federal law, mental health and substance use is one category, but in the Florida benchmark plan, that’s broken down into four benefits for inpatient and outpatient mental health and substance abuse. A spokesman for Rubio sent us a chart showing about 50 mandates and their accompanying state statutes. About half of the statutes related to health conditions or procedures such as newborn hearing screening, emergency room services and a mastectomy. The remainder were related to covering services by certain health providers, such as acupuncturists, or types of people covered such as dependent adult children. In the laws Rubio cited about providers, many don’t actually require that insurers cover certain services. For example, a statute Rubio cited about massage therapists states that if a policy covers massage, it must cover the services of a person licensed to practice massage if it has been prescribed by a physician. But the numbers alone don’t tell us much about the actual coverage patients receive -- we have to read the fine print to see who would get certain types of coverage under Florida’s laws, said Justin Giovannelli, an expert at Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute. For example, Rubio’s list references laws on substance abuse and mental health treatment, but state laws don’t require coverage for those services for the individual market. However, since the federal law supersedes state law, the Obamacare plans must cover those services. Rubio also cited a Florida law about maternity care. That statute isn’t a blanket requirement that insurers cover maternity care. Instead, it contains a few provisions that explain if a policy provides maternity care, here are the particular requirements -- for example, it must cover post-delivery services. Once the federal law defined maternity care as an essential health benefit, then all individual plans had to include coverage for that benefit -- regardless of existing state laws. (Before the law, some consumers purchased riders.) ""So whereas the ACA requires an insurer in the individual market in Florida to offer coverage that includes these benefits, if the ACA went away, an insurer would not be obligated by federal or state law to provide coverage of these benefits,"" Giovannelli said. Joe Antos, a health expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says it’s not surprising that Florida law lists more than 10 benefits. ""The tradition among insurance commissioners in most states is to be more precise about what has to be covered,"" he said. But comparing the number of state benefits with the ACA’s required essential health benefits isn’t the point, he said. ""The number really doesn’t matter. What matters is, what is the economic impact on the premiums?"" he said. ""When most people talk about this, they seem to think there are huge savings from cutting out things like maternity coverage and mental health. The reality is maternity coverage is very small percentage of the total for a comprehensive plan. Mental health would be expensive, but Medicaid picks up vast majority of mental health expenses."" Rubio has a point about the state legislatures having the power to set health care laws -- something it had before the ACA and will continue to have. Richard Cauchi, a health insurance expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said that nearly half of Florida’s health care related laws were enacted before 1989 and only six in the last 10 years. The federal health care law has had a role in expanding the types of conditions covered in Florida. As a result of the Affordable Care Act, Florida Blue added pediatric services for dental, vision and habilitative services, said Doug Bartel, Florida Blue spokesman. Rubio said, ""In order to sell insurance in Florida there are over 40 separate individual conditions that must be covered. ... far beyond the essential health benefits included in Obamacare."" Rubio’s spokesman pointed to a list of about 50 state mandates, about half of which pertained to health conditions. But many of the state mandates only apply if an insurer chooses to cover a condition. The federal protections are more sweeping and put more requirements on insurers to cover a broad range of services. Rubio’s comparison omits that state laws alone would leave Floridians on the individual market without certain types of coverage that are mandated by the federal law. He also ignores that state categories are defined more narrowly. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/jul/27/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-florida-mandates-coverage-more-co/
