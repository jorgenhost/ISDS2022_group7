Black and Latina women carried the brunt of job loss in December
","When the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued its latest job numbers, the Jan. 8, 2021, release brought a jaw-dropping number to light – from November to December the U.S. economy lost 140,000 jobs. Then came another jaw-dropper: As a group, only women lost jobs. Then came this claim, from Wisconsin Treasurer Sarah Godlewski. On Jan. 9, 2021, she tweeted a link to a CNN article about the job losses among women with this comment: ""This headline is hiding something from you. It wasn’t all women that lost jobs, it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment. Any response we have to this pandemic and economy has to also address structural inequality."" Did Black and Latina women carry the brunt of job loss nationally, while white women gained employment? When asked for a source, Godlewski’s office pointed to the CNN article, dated Jan. 8, that she retweeted. That article noted the U.S. economy lost 140,000 jobs overall, with women losing 156,000 jobs, while men gained 16,000 jobs. Her office also pointed to this paragraph in the article:  Black and Latina women disproportionately work in some of the hardest-hit sectors in the pandemic, often in roles that lack paid sick leave and the ability to work from home. As schools and day cares closed, many were forced to make hard trade-offs between work and parenting. ""Those sectors are less likely to have flexibility, so when employers are inflexible or women can't come to work because of caregiving responsibilities — they have to exit the workforce,"" said Nicole C. Mason, president and CEO of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. We did our own check of the BLS numbers, and the preliminary November and December numbers reflect what was in the CNN article. But Godlewski’s claim was specifically on the difference in outcomes for Black and Latina women, as groups, when compared to white women. The BLS conducted a separate survey known as the Current Population Survey, which  measures employment for Black, Hispanic or Latina, and white women ages 20 and older. This data was part of the Jan. 8 release of the December jobs numbers. Participating households respond to the survey in the week of Dec. 6. That data, which is not seasonally adjusted, indicates the number of employed Black women decreased by 82,000 from November to December, and the number of Hispanic or Latina women employed decreased by 31,000.  Meanwhile, the number of employed white women increased by 106,000 in the same time span.  The overall number of women in the labor force has been fluctuating since the March-to-April numbers, which marked the first full hit of the pandemic. There was a decrease from July to September. Laura Dresser, an economist with the Center on Wisconsin Strategy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said prior economic declines were led by male-dominated fields, such as construction and manufacturing. The pandemic-driven decline, she said, has strongly affected areas – such as the restaurant and education industries – with a high number of women workers. ""And those jobs are low-wage jobs,"" Dresser said. ""They're held disproportionately by women. They're held disproportionately by people of color."" With a link to a news article, Godlewski claimed: ""It wasn’t all women that lost jobs, it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.""  Federal statistics show that, as a group, women accounted for all of the job loss from November to December. What’s more, the number of employed white women increased during that time frame, while the numbers for Black and Hispanic or Latina women fell. We rate this claim True.    ","[('Sarah Godlewski, Twitter, Jan. 9, 2021.', 'https://twitter.com/SarahforWI/status/1347927993470087170'), ('Annalyn Kurtz (CNN), The US economy lost 140,000 jobs in December.

Viral photo shows Lauren Boebert in Colorado, not US Capitol
","U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., spent her first weeks in Congress arguing against the House impeachment vote against President Donald Trump, making false claims about the presidential election, objecting to new metal detectors in front of House chambers, and insisting that she could carry her handgun around the Capitol.  But there are some false claims being spread about the freshman congresswoman, too. In the days following the Capitol raid, viral captions have been shared alongside a photo featuring Boebert that claim it shows some of the rioters and was taken the day before the attack.  ""Congresswoman Lauren Boebert took this group on a guided tour of the Capitol one day before the insurrection. Three of the people participated and knew exactly where to go…"" one post reads. But the image wasn’t taken on the steps of the U.S. Capitol in January 2021. It dates back to December 2019 and was captured outside of the Colorado State Capitol. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The image first appeared in a Dec. 9, 2019, Colorado Times Recorder story about a rally against the state’s ""red flag"" law, which allows guns to be taken from people deemed a threat to themselves or others. The newspaper reported that Boebert attended the event and had just launched her campaign for Congress. ""Organizers of the ‘We Will Not Comply’ rally included Rally For Our Rights activist Lesley Hollywood, conservative Facebook personality Sheronna Bishop, and gun rights activist Lauren Boebert, who just launched her campaign for Colorado’s Third Congressional District, where she will challenge incumbent U.S. Rep. Scott Tipton in the Republican primary,"" the Times Recorder wrote.  In the image, Boebert is standing with members of the ""Bikers for Trump"" group, as well as ""American Patriots II%,"" which is listed as an anti-government extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Some people in the photograph appear to be displaying a white supremacist symbol. Facebook posts claim a photo of Boebert shows her standing with Capitol rioters before she gave them a tour of the building ""one day before the insurrection."" This isn’t accurate. Boebert is seen with members of an extremist group in the image, but it wasn’t taken recently, or on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. It’s from a December 2019 rally at Colorado’s Capitol.

No evidence that antifa incited Ashli Babbitt shooting
","Some conservative news sites have latched onto a speculative analysis to blame antifa for provoking the fatal shooting of Ashli Babbitt by Capitol Police.  ""Analysis concludes Antifa provoked shooting of Ashli Babbitt at Capitol,"" read the Jan. 12 headline of an article published by news site WorldNetDaily.  ""HUGE! Analysis of video of Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt death in the Capitol shows antifa's actions led to shots being fired,"" read the headline of an article published by the Gateway Pundit.  The articles were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The stories cite a video interview conducted by the Epoch Times, a Trump-supporting news outlet. On Jan. 13 in response to fact checks published by AFP and Lead Stories, WorldNetDaily issued a correction to the article and updated both the headline and subheadline.  PolitiFact has already examined baseless claims that antifa, a broad left-wing coalition of anti-fascist activists, was behind the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol. But we wanted to look more closely at this ""analysis"" that was getting a lot of attention on social media. The headline of the Epoch Times video does not directly mention antifa, but it suggests that ""coordinated actions"" resulted in Babbitt’s death. (It also misspells Ashli Babbitt’s name.) In the Epoch Times interview, Masako Ganaha, who is described as an independent journalist in Japan, discusses an analysis she did of two videos that documented the shooting of Ashli Babbitt. Babbitt was a U.S. Air Force veteran and Trump supporter from California who died after being shot Jan. 6 by Capitol Police as she joined rioters who overtook the Capitol, disrupting the congressional effort to certify electoral votes in the presidential election. The U.S. attorney’s office has announced that it has opened a federal excessive force investigation into her death.  In the video, Ganaha points out what she considers to be signs of antifa involvement. Shortly before Babbitt’s shooting, Ganaha says, one rioter, who is wearing a yellow flag like a cape, hands a helmet to another rioter, who uses it to begin to smash the glass on the door to the Speaker’s Lobby. Ganaha says that the hand-off of the helmet illustrates that the two rioters are antifa activists working together to incite the crowd. After Babbitt is shot, the person who handed off his helmet is filmed running down a flight of stairs toward police officers and putting an article of clothing in a backpack, Ganaha says.  ""He was leading the crowd and communicating with the other guy, and he was changing his appearance. How would a Trump supporter do that?"" Ganaha says.  Ganaha does not provide any hard evidence for her assertions that the two rioters are antifa provocateurs. We reached out to her but haven’t heard back.  Ganaha also points to John Sullivan, a controversial activist who filmed one of the videos, and describes him as a member of antifa who helped incite the crowd after the Babbitt shooting by repeatedly exclaiming that Babbitt was ""dead."" PolitiFact looked into claims about Sullivan and found that while Sullivan was at the Capitol, he does not identify as antifa nor as a Trump supporter. Rather, he appears to be a polarizing figure on both sides of the political spectrum.  Sullivan has told a number of news outlets, including PolitiFact, that he attended the Jan. 6 riot to document what happened. He has used anti-Trump and anti-police hashtags in Twitter posts, and he has been filmed using incendiary language in the past. However, Jade Sacker, a documentary filmmaker working on a project about Sullivan, and Sullivan himself have both denied claims that he is antifa-affiliated or that he led the charge on the Capitol.  The claim builds off the unfounded conspiracy theory that antifa drove the attack on the Capitol.  The rumor flies in the face of substantial reporting and documentary evidence. The march to the Capitol was weeks in the making, with plans indicating the potential for violence drawn up in the open on social media forums and pro-Trump websites. Video and photographs from the scene show Trump-branded paraphernalia and flags, and well-known far-right personalities and GOP politicians were filmed participating in the riot. Some even broadcast their involvement on live-streams.  The FBI’s assistant director in charge of the FBI Washington field office, Steven D’Antuono, said in a Jan. 8 call with reporters that there was currently ""no indication"" that antifa activists had disguised themselves as Trump supporters and carried out the Capitol riot. An analysis claims that antifa provoked the shooting of Ashli Babbitt. The analysis consists of a series of speculative claims and inferences based on video of the Babbitt shooting.  Those claiming that the pro-Trump mob at the Capitol was incited by antifa have provided no hard proof of their assertions. The claims ignore substantial reporting and documentary evidence that the crowd contained Trump supporters.  We rate this Pants on Fire! ​","[('John Sullivan on Twitter, accessed Jan. 8, 2021', 'https://twitter.com/activistjohn'), ('Jayden X on Twitter, accessed Jan. 8, 2021', 'No link'), ('Jayden X on YouTube, ""Shooting and Storming Of The US Capitol In Washington DC (View Discretion Is Advised),"" Jan. 7, 2021', 'https://twitter.com/thejaydenxander'), ('Buzzfeed News, ""The FBI Says There\'s No Evidence Of Antifa Involvement In The Capitol Mob,"" Jan. 8, 2021', 'No link'), ('Buzzfeed News, ""The Rioters Who Took Over The Capitol Have Been Planning Online In The Open For Weeks,"" Jan. 6, 2021', 'https://youtu.be/PfiS8MsfSF4'), ('CBS News, ""West Virginia lawmaker records himself storming the U.S. Capitol: \'We\'re in!,\'"" Jan. 7, 2021', 'No link'), ('Epoch Times, Video: Analysis of Ashli Babbit video suggests coordinated actions–interview with Masako, Jan. 11, 2021', 'https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/fbi-no-antifa-capitol-mob'), ('NBC News, ""Trump loyalists push evidence-free claims that antifa activists fueled mob,"" Jan. 6, 2021', 'No link'), ('New York Times, How the Epoch Times created a giant influence machine, Nov. 12, 2020', 'https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/trump-rioters-planned-online'), ('Newsguard, The Epoch Times', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Face-painted man in horned fur cap at Capitol riot supports Trump and QAnon, not antifa,"" Jan. 7, 2021', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/derrick-evans-west-virginia-us-capitol-video/'), ('PolitiFact, ""High-Ranking California Republican Lawmaker Pushes Misinformation About Storming of U.S. Capitol,"" Jan. 6, 2021', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""No, facial recognition didn’t confirm antifa infiltrated Trump supporters at the Capitol,"" Jan. 7, 2021', 'https://www.theepochtimes.com/mkt_app/video-analysis-of-ashli-babbit-video-suggests-coordinated-actions-interview-with-masako_3652783.html'), ('PolitiFact, Facebook posts wrongly claim left-wing activist, antifa ‘incited’ US Capitol mob, Jan. 8, 2021', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Mo Brooks pushes baseless claim that antifa orchestrated Capitol riots,"" Jan. 7, 2021', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/trump-loyalists-push-evidence-free-claims-antifa-activists-fueled-mob-n1253176'), ('PolitiFact, ""There’s no proof antifa stormed the Capitol.

Image of Pramila Jayapal without mask is out of context
","Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., blamed her Republican colleagues after she and two other House Democrats tested positive for COVID-19 in the days following the U.S. Capitol mob, which forced lawmakers into close quarters as they took shelter from the violence. ""I just received a positive COVID-19 test result after being locked down in a secured room at the Capitol where several Republicans not only cruelly refused to wear a mask but recklessly mocked colleagues and staff who offered them one,"" Jayapal wrote in a Jan. 12 tweet. Several Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has supported the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, were seen on video refusing to wear masks while members of both chambers waited out the siege from the secured room. But some social media users say photo and video evidence shows that Jayapal also didn’t wear a mask as the rioters breached the building and halted congressional proceedings. ""There’s pictures and videos of (Jayapal) not wearing a mask that day,"" says one tweet reposted on Jan. 12 to Facebook, which shows an image of Jayapal from the day of the riot. Posts sharing the same photograph on Facebook and other platforms were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The image — a screenshot from a longer video taken as the mob moved inside the Capitol — purports to show Jayapal maskless in the balcony of the House chambers. But the image is missing context. Jayapal said in a subsequent tweet and later in a Jan. 13 interview on ABC’s ""The View"" that she had taken off her face mask to put on a gas mask.  ""We were then under siege,"" Jayapal said, explaining that she was trapped in the gallery with about 12 other lawmakers. ""The Capitol police told us at that point to get off of our chairs, to get on the floor, to take off our masks, and to actually be ready to put on our gas masks. So if you look at those pictures, I am holding in my right hand a gas mask."" ""We were specifically told to take off our masks, because you can’t breathe within the gas mask if you have the other mask on,"" she continued. ""So all of us had been wearing masks. We took off our masks. We held our gas masks. And we were down on the floor."" The full video footage from which the photograph was captured supports Jayapal’s explanation. As Snopes reported, the video shows Jayapal with her gas mask in hand. The video shows another person, seated on the floor a row above Jayapal, with the gas mask already on.  ""You can see the gas mask in her right hand in the photo,"" said Jayapal spokesperson Chris Evans. Evans said Jayapal tested negative for COVID-19 on Jan. 5, a day before the Capitol siege. Jayapal criticized Republicans for refusing masks while lawmakers were ""locked down in a secured room at the Capitol."" The out-of-context photograph shows Jayapal in the House chambers, before she had been ushered to that secured location. A Facebook post says a video screenshot shows that Jayapal was not wearing a mask in Congress during the Capitol mob.  The post is missing critical context: Jayapal and other lawmakers taking shelter in the balcony of the House chambers were instructed to take off their masks and prepare to put on gas masks.

Jacobs overstates election issues
","Rep. Chris Jacobs, a Republican who represents suburbs around Buffalo and Rochester, said in a statement that he voted against certifying the electoral college vote because of election irregularities, and said states made changes to election processes that sowed distrust. In an interview with WKBW, he told reporter Hannah Buehler: ""There’s been a lot of questions about election integrity, but I was going in terms of my constitutional role,"" he said. ""When you look at the Constitution of the United States, it gives specific power to state legislators to control, run and dictate the terms of elections in their states. There were several states where outside actors dramatically changed the rules of the road, so to speak, two weeks out, one week out, on how elections would be run.""  We wondered about whether ""outside actors"" changed election procedures one or two weeks before the election.  Competitive states We reached out to Jacobs’ spokesperson, who said that the ""outside actors"" Jacobs referred to are courts and officials outside of state legislatures. Spokesman Christian Chase referred us the U.S.  Constitution, which states, in Article 1, Section 4: ""The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.""  Jacobs was referring to situations in Pennsylvania and Arizona, Chase said.   In Pennsylvania, the State Supreme Court extended by three days a deadline that had required ballots to be received when the polls closed, Chase said. This happened Sept. 17. Mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania had begun to be delivered in some counties in late September, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.  He also said the Pennsylvania Secretary of State ""waived a requirement in state law"" that required signature verification on mail-in ballots. This guidance was issued on Sept. 11, and was upheld by the state Supreme Court, which found that the guidance was not in conflict with state law.  Jacobs’ spokesman also said that Pennsylvania ""allowed for unequal curing of ballots by different jurisdictions."" Factcheck.org found that there were inconsistencies when it came to curing ballots, or the process of allowing voters to correct mistakes so their ballots will be counted. Some counties did, and some did not. While the guidance from the state, which was issued close to the election, was uniform, it was applied inconsistently, the site found.   In Pennsylvania, the secretary of state is the state’s ""chief election official,"" and is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate.   In Arizona, Jacobs pointed to changes to the registration deadline by federal courts.  We asked election and voting experts about procedures in swing states.  The laws that were in place for the general election were in place for months, often years before the election, said David Becker, executive director and founder of The Center for Election Innovation & Research, a nonprofit organization that promotes election security and increased voter participation. In states where lawsuits were brought -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin -- the changes were made by legislatures dominated by Republicans, Becker said.  The rules were set in advance, but there was some pre-election litigation, and voters had to rely upon whatever the final rules were, Becker said.  ABC News published a story less than a week before Election Day regarding state election officials who had to deal with the impact of last-minute litigation and the resulting court rulings. County election officials in Michigan and Wisconsin told the network that differing directives from courts had been confusing.     The U.S. Supreme Court also issued rulings affecting election procedures in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, in the days before Election Day. In Pennsylvania, on Oct. 19, a little more than two weeks before Election Day, the court allowed a three-day extension to count ballots to remain in place.  Amber McReynolds, chief executive officer of the National Vote at Home Institute, a nonpartisan organization that promotes voting by mail, told PolitiFact that secretaries of state are responsible for providing guidance and direction to local election officials, so it’s natural for them to provide guidance, especially in emergency situations.  States have different ways of administering elections, and legislatures can formalize these policies in statute, according to The National Conference of State Legislatures.   ""State legislatures, with input from their governors, can make state laws about the administration of elections and make or initiate election administration amendments to their state constitutions,"" according to a 2019 Congressional Research Service report. ""State laws and constitutions can also delegate or defer responsibility for decisions about the administration of elections to other state or local officials and to voters."" Jacobs said that he voted against certifying the Electoral College vote because he looked at the Constitution and it gives state legislatures authority over elections, but that he saw that ""outside actors dramatically changed the rules of the road"" within two weeks of the election.  State laws regarding election procedures were in place months, or years, before Election Day. There were some legal challenges and guidance from state election officials near the election. But secretaries of state and other state and local election officials have duties related to running elections and are not ""outside actors."" Courts are the place to hear legal challenges to election rules.  It's questionable that three-day registration deadline extensions, extending the deadline for ballots to be received, and offering voters opportunities to correct their ballots are ""dramatic"" changes to election procedures, as Jacobs states.  We rate this claim Mostly False.   ","[('Rep.

No, Efforts To Recall California Gov. Newsom Are Not ‘A Coup’
","In remarks described by political observers as both factually wrong and politically foolish, California Democratic Party Chairman Rusty Hicks called the growing effort to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom as ""the California coup."" ""This recall effort, which really ought to be called ‘the California coup,’ is being led by right-wing conspiracy theorists, white nationalists, anti-vaxxers and groups who encourage violence on our democratic institutions,"" Hicks said Tuesday at a press conference meant to condemn the endeavor, which remains in the signature-gathering stage.  Sherry Yang, a spokesperson for the Democratic party, kicked off the event by also calling the recall a ""coup."" Hicks provided no evidence linking the recall to the groups he cited. Nor did he explain how the recall effort, which is a legal process to remove a local or state elected leader and has been allowed by the state constitution for more than a century, was akin to a coup — which it clearly is not.  We’re aware that Hicks was using partisan rhetoric to cast the recall effort in a negative light when he referred to it as ""the California coup."" He later said the party wasn’t challenging the legality of the campaign. Still, words matter and not everyone who heard or read his comments will fully understand what they mean. So we decided to explore the monumental differences between the two actions in this fact check. What Is A Coup?  Keith Smith, a political science professor at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, said the actions aren’t in the same ballpark. ""A coup is usually defined as a violent effort to overthrow a legitimately- elected and legitimately-installed government, to somehow by the use of force take power in a government,"" he said.  Other scholars contend that a coup must involve some portion of the state military, police or security forces, who work to overthrow the government.  What Is A Recall Campaign? The recall effort, on the other hand, ""is not that at all,"" Smith said. ""It’s people signing petitions that are being circulated around the state to put something on the ballot, which is a perfectly legitimate and prescribed process in democratic government,"" the professor added. To qualify the recall for a future ballot, the campaign must submit approximately 1.5 million signatures of registered voters to county elections officials by March 17, all of which must be verified. Proponents said last week they had gathered more than 1 million signatures.  A recall ballot has two parts: A yes or no vote for recall and the names of replacement candidates. When asked at the press conference whether Democrats would list a replacement candidate, Hicks said ""Anything and everything is on the table.""  History Of California Recalls California voters approved the recall process in 1911. Since then, there have been 165 attempts to recall state elected leaders, according to the Secretary of State’s Office. Nine of them collected enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, and of those, the elected official was recalled in five cases.  The most notable was the recall of Democratic Gov. Gray Davis in 2003 in favor of Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. The recall effort was the first successful recall of a California governor, and only the second recall of a state governor in American history, according to Ballotpedia. Wrong Term And Political Mistake? Regarding the use of ""California coup,"" some political observers say Hicks was both factually off base and committed an unforced political error.  ""I don’t think that it’s politically smart. I don’t think it’s civically appropriate,""  said Wesley Hussey, a political science professor at Sacramento State University who wrote about Davis’ recall.  Of the current recall effort, Hussey said ""the (state) Constitution very clearly lays out this is an avenue of recourse for people unhappy with an elected official at the local, legislative and executive level in the state."" In California, proponents do not need to cite a specific reason for recalling an elected official, he added. Our Ruling California Democratic Party Chairman Rusty Hicks described the effort to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom as ""the California coup.""  Even in the bounds of political rhetoric, his remarks are far off base and wildly inaccurate. A coup is a violent overthrow of a government. A recall is a legally sanctioned effort to vote an elected official out of office midway through their term. It’s been part of California’s constitution for more than a century.  We rate Hicks’ statement Pants On Fire.  PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.  ","[('Rusty Hicks, chairman, California Democratic Party, remarks at press conference, Jan. 12, 2021.', 'https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/recalls/recall-history-california-1913-present'), ('Wesley Hussey, political science professor, Sacramento State University, interview Jan. 12, 2021.\xa0', 'No link'), ('Keith Smith, political science professor, University of the Pacific, interview Jan. 12, 2021', 'https://ballotpedia.org/Gray_Davis_recall_(2003)'), ('California Secretary of State, Recall History In California, accessed Jan. 13, 2021.', 'No link'), ('Ballotpedia, Gray Davis Recall (2003), accessed Jan. 13, 2021.', 'https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2021/01/08/california-democrats-try-to-tie-newsom-recall-movement-to-capitol-attack-1353675'), ('Politico, California Democrats try to tie Newsom recall movement to Capitol attack, Jan. 13, 2021.', 'No link'), ('Washington Post, column, Was the U.S. Capitol riot really a coup?

Don't fall for rumors about a Trump-led military takeover, emergency alerts
","The warnings across social media are plentiful. Alarmist claims advise people to stock up on food, water, medicine and weapons. In the days following the Jan. 6 riots on the U.S. Capitol, online message boards and social media platforms are filled with assertions that a nationwide military takeover is coming.  Most versions of the rumor say the plan is being implemented by President Donald Trump, the final step in an elaborate scheme to release damning information about his enemies that will land them in jail and allow him to remain in office for another four years. But these lengthy and detailed narratives simply are not rooted in reality. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Most variations of the rumor, like this Facebook post, claim without evidence that ""military takedowns"" and arrests will begin soon and continue up to Jan. 20, Inauguration Day: ""Everyone will be getting emergency alerts on their phones, tv's, radios & internet. It will override all other broadcasts and could last for several hours at a time."" ""DO NOT travel to any large cities (especially Philadelphia) for the rest of the month. Military operations will be taking place in many of the major corrupt cities,"" the post continues. ""...The implementation of the Insurrection Act began after the raid on the Capitol and was marked by Trump's broadcast to the people to disband and return home. This broadcast wound up being blocked, for the most part, by the media. Nevertheless, his address fulfilled the requirements to initiate the Act."" It went on to claim that the Federal Communications Commission told media organizations they can’t ""block the flow of intel"" and concluded that Trump has no plans to concede and that he will remain in office for another four years.  But Trump has not invoked the Insurrection Act, and the military is not being sent to take over ""major corrupt cities,"" by him or anyone else. There are no planned nationwide emergency alerts, and Trump signaled he will support a smooth transition of power, adding that he would not be attending President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration. Any ramp up in military responses in the coming days is directly related to securing the inauguration, military officials told PolitiFact. ""From the Department of Defense’s perspective, we are not taking any stance or position, or moving people anywhere to address any of those concerns,"" said DOD spokesperson Christopher Sherwood. ""Other than supporting the National Guard for the inauguration on Jan. 20, the DOD is not taking further action as far as I am aware."" The Defense Department encompasses the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force. There is also no evidence that U.S. citizens will soon receive emergency alerts on their devices.  The notion that the Federal Communications Commission told media organizations they can’t ""block the flow"" of the alleged intel is a severe misreading of a routine advisory that was published on Jan. 7, an FCC spokesperson said. ""Our Enforcement Bureau periodically issues advisories to promote compliance with FCC rules and, as detailed in the first paragraph, this advisory was informed by the results of the 2019 nationwide Emergency Alert System test,"" spokesperson Will Wiquist wrote in an email, characterizing this particular advisory as ""very routine.""  Some of the speculation about the advisory may have come from a portion of the document that states that presidential messages must be transmitted in national emergencies. But this does not mean that the FCC was warning broadcast and other communications providers against blocking an incoming Trump message.  The Emergency Alert System is a national public warning system that the FCC, FEMA and the National Weather Service are charged with maintaining. It is commonly used by state and local authorities to deliver important emergency information, such as weather and AMBER alerts. It also enables the president to communicate via live audio transmission to the public during a national emergency.   The conspiracy theory was initially pushed by QAnon accounts, which are banned on Facebook and Twitter but have found ways to persist. The original posts were turned into forwarded text messages before morphing back into more widespread social media posts.  The overarching theme relies on the belief that Trump’s campaign will culminate in a sort of judgment day when he will unmask and punish his enemies. Q, the anonymous internet persona behind QAnon, has predicted that this would happen on several different days, none of which panned out.  Viral social media posts say Trump has ordered the military to take over ""corrupt major cities"" in order to stay in office and that U.S. citizens will receive emergency alerts on their devices. The rumor was created by known conspiracy theorists and has no basis in truth. Military and federal communications officials both rejected the claims and Trump signaled he would support a peaceful transition to a ""new"" administration. We rate it Pants on Fire!

How bipartisan was the vote to impeach Donald Trump, in historical context?
","How bipartisan was the second impeachment of Donald Trump? CNN anchor Jake Tapper said it was the most bipartisan presidential impeachment in history. Trump’s second impeachment was ""not just bipartisan —  it’s the most bipartisan impeachment in American history,"" Tapper said moments after the vote was taken on Jan. 13, 2021. While the second House impeachment of President Donald Trump was largely approved on party lines, it did attract a higher level of bipartisan support compared with past presidential impeachment efforts. Ten House Republicans sided with Democrats in voting to impeach Trump. That’s more than the number of Republicans who supported the first impeachment of Trump in 2019, which was zero. It’s also higher than the five Democrats who voted to impeach President Bill Clinton on both successful counts in 1998. And it was more bipartisan than the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson, which did not receive any Democratic support. (We’ll address President Richard Nixon, who resigned under threat of impeachment, as well.) The article of impeachment considered by the House on Jan. 13 cited Trump’s false claims about the election results, including at the rally of his supporters on Jan. 6. By having ""incited"" the crowd, the article said, Trump ""gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government. He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of government."" The final vote was 232 to 197, with 10 Republicans joining all Democrats in voting for the sole article of impeachment. The Republicans who broke ranks and voted to impeach were Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican; John Katko of New York; Adam Kinzinger of Illinois; Fred Upton and Peter Meijer of Michigan; Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse of Washington; Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio; Tom Rice of South Carolina; and David Valadao of California.  Here’s a rundown of past presidential impeachments, including some committee votes. When Johnson was impeached in 1868, no Democrat in the House supported the overall floor vote to impeach. In that vote, all but two Republicans voted for impeachment. The House went on to pass 11 specific articles of impeachment, along largely party-line votes. The impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998 attracted less bipartisan support for the two of the four articles approved by the Judiciary Committee that went on to win approval on the House floor.  The first article that won approval from the full House was Article 1, which said that Clinton had ""willfully provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony"" to the grand jury related to the Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky sexual harassment cases."" This article passed the committee on a party-line vote. On the floor, the article was approved 228-206, with five Republicans voting against it and five Democrats voting for the article. The other one to pass the House, Article 3, said that Clinton had obstructed justice related to the lawsuits against him. This article also passed the committee on a party-line vote, and it passed the full House by a 221-212 margin, with 12 Republicans voting against it and five Democrats voting for the article. Two articles passed the committee but failed on the floor. Article 2 involved perjury during Clinton’s answers in depositions. In committee, this was a party-line vote, except for one Republican defection — then-Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. On the floor, it failed, 205-229.  And Article 4, which addressed obstruction of Congress, passed the committee on a party-line vote before failing on the floor, 148-245. Article 1 against Trump in 2019 addressed abuse of power, focusing on Trump’s alleged efforts to strong-arm Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden. The article passed the Judiciary Committee on a party-line vote. Article 2 focused on Trump’s efforts to block cooperation with Congress on its impeachment inquiry. This passed the Judiciary Committee by an identical party-line vote. On the House floor, no Republican voted for either article. Two Democrats voted against Article 1, Reps. Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey. (Van Drew later switched his affiliation to the GOP.) Peterson and Van Drew were joined in voting against Article 2 by Democratic Rep. Jared Golden of Maine.  The impeachment of President Richard Nixon in 1974 didn’t make it to the House floor because Nixon resigned first. So it’s not directly comparable. But we can look at what happened in the House Judiciary Committee when it approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon. Article 1, which focused on obstruction of justice, won support from six Republican committee members as well as all Democrats. That was about one-third of Republicans on the committee. Article 2, which focused on abuse of power, also secured the support of six Republican committee members in addition to all Democrats.  Article 3, which focused on obstruction of Congress, received less bipartisan support, even though it passed the committee. This article saw two Democratic defections and only two Republicans joining with the Democratic majority. Such votes make Nixon’s impeachment the previous high-water mark for bipartisanship, though again it’s not a case of apples-to-apples since we’ll never know what the floor vote would have looked like. That said, the number of committee Republicans joining Democrats for the Nixon impeachment was smaller than the number of overall House Republicans backing Trump’s second impeachment. Tapper said the second impeachment of Donald Trump was ""the most bipartisan impeachment in American history."" Trump’s second impeachment attracted more Republican support — 10 GOP floor votes in favor — than the impeachments of Andrew Johnson or Bill Clinton, or Trump’s first impeachment. We rate the statement True.","[('Article of impeachment against Donald Trump considered on Jan. 13, 2021', 'https://cicilline.house.gov/sites/cicilline.house.gov/files/documents/ARTICLES%20-%20Final%201030%20-%20011121.pdf'), ('U.S. Senate, ""The Impeachment of Andrew Johnson (1868) President of the United States,"" accessed Jan. 2021', 'No link'), ('Congressional Research Service, ""Congressional Resolutions on Presidential Impeachment: A Historical Overview,""\xa0 Sept. 16, 1998', 'https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Impeachment_Johnson.htm'), ('PolitiFact, ""How the impeachment articles against Trump are similar to, and different from, Clinton and Nixon,"" Dec. 10, 2019', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2021/jan/13/jake-tapper/how-bipartisan-was-vote-impeach-donald-trump-histo/

Nunes falsely claims ‘Republicans have “no way to communicate” without Parler
","Tech companies are cracking down on accounts and services that they believe violate their terms of service or spread extremist messages and misinformation. Parler, a social media platform popular with conservatives, was kicked off Amazon Web Services following the violent riot Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol. Google and Apple deleted the Parler app from their stores. Twitter suspended 70,000 accounts affiliated with the QAnon conspiracy theory and booted the @realdonaldtrump account, while Facebook said it would remove ""stop the steal"" messages claiming election fraud and suspended President Donald Trump at least through Joe Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration. Google’s YouTube video service also barred Trump at least until the inauguration. U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., says the actions have left Republicans with ""no way to communicate."" Here’s what he said in an interview on Fox News’ ""Sunday Morning Futures"" show: ""There is no longer a free and open social media company or site for any American to get on any longer, because these big companies, Apple, Amazon, Google"" destroyed Parler. ""Poof — it’s gone."" He added: ""Republicans have no way to communicate. And it doesn't even matter if you're a Republican or conservative. If you don't want to be regulated by left-wingers that are at Twitter and Facebook and Instagram, where you get shadowbanned, nobody gets to see you."" Nunes said he has 3 million followers on Parler. ""Tonight, I will no longer be able to communicate with those people,"" he said in the segment. Amazon cited violent content when it shut off Parler’s access to its cloud service. Parler sued Amazon, saying the decision showed ""political animus."" With Parler’s future uncertain, we fact-checked Nunes’ claim that Republicans have no way to communicate and found it to be a gross exaggeration. Nunes has lost one tool in his toolbox to communicate with constituents, but he and other Republicans still have many others, both on social media and other methods. In the past, it was Nunes who was pushing social media companies to restrict speech that he objected to. He filed several defamation lawsuits against media companies and critics, including one against Twitter over a parody account purporting to represent a fictitious Nunes-owned dairy cow. We contacted a spokesperson for Nunes to ask about his latest criticism of social media regulation, but did not get a response.  Some users on Twitter found it ironic that Nunes was making his claim on Fox News, the most watched cable network, and a favorite medium for Republicans to communicate. ""This reminds me of that Lisa Kudrow character on that Netflix mockumentary where she repeats ‘conservative voices are being silenced’ on multiple TV shows, interviews, book titles etc.,"" replied one Twitter user. And long before social media, members of Congress had several venues to communicate with constituents, including some unfiltered ones. ""There is a full time media press corps in the Capitol all day, every day — members of Congress have almost open access if they want to get something out,"" Brendan Buck, a former staffer to Republican House Speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner, told PolitiFact. ""Each one of them has their own website and are able to post whatever they want.""  House members can communicate via press releases, send out mass emails or paper mail to constituents, or host phone-in or online town halls. Capitol Hill has places where members can hold in-person press conferences or satellite interviews with media outlets back home or national outlets, or record a video message to email to their constituents. Republicans can give interviews to local media outlets, conservative radio or TV shows that welcome conservative points of view.  ""There is no shortage of places for a member of Congress to communicate through traditional media, and still more through direct channels to constituents,"" Buck said. When members go home to their districts, they speak at gatherings such as chamber of commerce luncheons, civic and religious groups and community fairs (though some such events are done remotely now amid the pandemic). Nunes’ own congressional website includes links to his official Twitter and Facebook pages, accounts he still can use, although they have fewer than the 3 million followers he said he had on Parler. He also has a personal Twitter account that has 1.2 million followers. Nunes’ website also shows he has press releases, and people can subscribe to his emails. Nunes uses Rumble, a video streaming service that is seen as the conservative alternative to YouTube. House members get an allowance of taxpayer funds to pay for staff and supplies, including communications. Separately, lawmakers’ campaign operations receive donations that help fund their communications with voters. Buck described social media as a tool that supplements the other ways members communicate with their constituents. But some former staffers said it became a crucial tool to communicate quickly and directly with constituents without having to involve reporters.  ""It is the best way, but it is not the only way,"" said Rusty Roberts, who was chief of staff for U.S. Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., from 1992 to 2011. ""It’s immediate communication."" Nunes said that ""left-wingers"" at Twitter and Facebook and Instagram regulate users and decide what content is violent and who gets shadowbanned, a practice that limits someone’s reach on the web. Twitter and Facebook have policies that allow them to remove accounts or posts that violate their terms of service. For example, Twitter prohibits tweets that threaten or glorify violence and Facebook removes harmful misinformation about COVID-19, including about the vaccines, and says it doesn’t allow threats. While Trump lost his access to Twitter and Facebook under these rules, other Republicans, including Nunes, still have broad access to various communication channels.  ""As Rep. Nunes was on Fox when he said this, he seems to have ways to communicate,"" said Rebecca Jeschke, a spokesperson Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group which promotes free speech and digital privacy. ""Not to mention that these suspensions didn't hit anywhere near all the Republican politicians or voters in the country.""   Nunes said ""Republicans have no way to communicate"" after recent actions by tech companies. Trump has been blocked from the major social media networks, and Parler is not available for now. But Nunes is wrong to say Republicans have no way to communicate.  They can use other social media platforms — if they follow the rules — as well as their websites, email and regular mail. Lawmakers can also grant interviews with local and national reporters from mainstream or conservative media outlets and hold constituent forums in their districts (albeit remotely for now). For now, Nunes has lost what appears to be his preferred method of communication, but he has other options, and so do his Republican peers. We rate this claim False. RELATED: U.S. Rep.

","As the House weighs a second impeachment of President Donald Trump following the U.S. Capitol mob attack, Newsmax TV host Greg Kelly argued against removing Trump from office and called for the impeachment of someone else: President-elect Joe Biden. Kelly’s justification for impeaching Biden, who takes office Jan. 20, involves a video that the Newsmax TV host presented out of context. ""You know, if I were in Congress, I would launch an impeachment effort against Joe Biden for election fraud in 2020, and I would call him as a witness,"" Kelly said in the Jan. 11 segment. ""I already found this. It’s a very interesting clip that I found in a dark corner of the internet."" Kelly played a short clip of Biden’s Oct. 24 interview on ""Pod Save America,'' a liberal podcast. It showed Biden saying: ""We have put together, I think, the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization."" ""I think that was a confession,"" Kelly said, laughing. ""Could you do anything with that? How would you defend about that? There are credible allegations of voter fraud. He’s admitting to it. What would you say? ‘Oh, well that was a brain lapse.’ Or was that a Freudian slip?"" The clip that Kelly played on air, however, was not a ""confession"" of Biden ""admitting to"" voter fraud. It was shown out of context, much like a similar clip that White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany shared on Twitter months earlier. PolitiFact rated McEnany’s claim that Biden admitted to voter fraud False. Kelly’s claim is similarly inaccurate. Newsmax declined to comment. The full-length interview shows that Biden was responding to a question from host Dan Pfeiffer, a former staffer of President Barack Obama. Pfeiffer asked what Biden would say to people who had not yet voted or did not have a plan to vote. Biden’s answer was long and winding. (The full transcript is here.)  While Biden used the words ""voter fraud organization,"" he was describing a project to help people learn where and how to vote legally. The full context makes it clear that Biden was not encouraging widespread voter fraud or claiming that Democrats were guilty of it. ""It can get complicated,"" Biden said of voting. ""Because the Republicans are doing everything they can to make it harder for people to vote, particularly people of color to vote."" ""We have put together, I think, the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics,"" he continued, referencing the system Democrats had in place for people that ran into trouble casting their ballot because of long lines or other problems. He described the system, telling listeners a number they could call for help and information ""if, in fact, you have any problem."" ""We have over a thousand lawyers, over a thousand of them answering the phone,"" he said. ""If you think there’s any challenge to your voting, go to 833-DEM-VOTE. Dial those letters on your phone. That will get you the assistance that we have already put in place."" Biden’s campaign clarified his remarks by saying Biden had the ""most robust and sophisticated team in presidential campaign history to confront voter suppression."" Biden had talked about the same voter protection effort during a speech in August and an interview in September. Despite Kelly’s mention of ""credible allegations,"" there remains no evidence that widespread voter fraud affected the election, which Biden won. Dozens of judges in courtrooms across the country rejected the legal challenges brought by Trump and his allies. Kelly said that Biden is on video ""admitting to"" election fraud in a ""confession."" That’s wrong. The full-context video shows Biden was describing an effort to prevent voter suppression and help people vote when he misspoke.  We rate Kelly’s statement False.","[('Newsmax, ""Greg Kelly Reports,"" Jan. 11, 2021', 'https://www.newsmaxtv.com/Shows/Greg-Kelly-Reports/vid/1_ghn44y14'), ('Mediaite, ""Newsmax’s Greg Kelly Demands Joe Biden’s Impeachment for ‘Election Fraud’ Based on Debunked Clip,"" Jan. 12, 2021', 'No link'), ('Crooked Media, Pod Save America, ""We Got Joe!""

No, State Department didn't issue statement saying Trump's term had ended

Pelosi is still speaker of the House. Viral video shows standard pro tempore procedure
","Nancy Pelosi was re-elected speaker of the House for the 117th Congress on Jan. 3. Despite a shrinking Democratic House majority, Pelosi won 216 votes to retain her leadership post. A handful of Democrats broke ranks to support someone else or vote present and all House Republicans voted for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Now a viral, 28-second clip from a Jan. 11 House session is being misconstrued on social media. The Facebook user who shared the video inaccurately claims that it shows Pelosi is ""no longer speaker of the House"" as of that date. That’s a complete misreading of the clip: Pelosi is still the House speaker. The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The clip shows the opening of a pro forma session when representatives were asked for unanimous consent to consider a resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence to activate the 25th Amendment to remove President Donald Trump from office. A pro forma session is a short period of time when either the House or Senate is technically in legislative session but when no votes are held and no formal business is typically conducted.  The video shows House clerk Joe Novotny, reading a letter from Pelosi that appoints Rep. Deborah Dingell, D-Mich., as ""speaker pro tempore,"" a short-term assignment that is normal procedure when the usual presiding officer is absent. The assignment is temporary and does not indicate that the speaker of the House has been removed or resigned. Chapter 34, Sec. 6, of the House Practice guide to the Rules, Precedents and Procedures of the House says: ""The Speaker may appoint a Speaker pro tempore. Such an appointment may not exceed three legislative days, except that in the case of illness the Speaker's appointment may extend to 10 days with the approval of the House.""  A video of the full session is available on C-SPAN, which says in its description that Republican Rep. Alex Moone of West Virginia objected to the request for unanimous consent to take up the 25th Amendment resolution, thus blocking the action for now.  A Facebook post including a video of a Jan. 11 House session claims that it shows that Pelosi is no longer House speaker. This is wrong. The clip showed the opening of a pro forma session when the presiding officer, in this case Pelosi, was absent and appointed a ""speaker pro tempore."" This is standard procedure and doesn’t indicate that Pelosi resigned as speaker eight days after being re-elected to the position. We rate this False.

No, Juneteenth National Independence Day doesn't replace Fourth of July
","Two days before the nation celebrated Juneteenth, the bipartisan bill that recognized June 19 as a federal holiday achieved near unanimous passage as it was voted on in the House.  Among its dissenters was Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Montana, who joined 13 other  members in voting against the bill. After casting his nay vote, Rosendale stated is rationale on Twitter: ""I voted against a bill that would make Juneteenth National Independence Day a federal holiday. One of 14 Republicans to do so. ... (The left’s) intent is to replace the Fourth of July with this new day, one that will inevitably focus on America's darkest moments,"" Rosendale tweeted.  Hours later, the sentiment was echoed on Fox News by Tucker Carlson, who said on his June 16 show that ""starting this Saturday, our country will get a new Independence Day, to supplant the old one.""  Carlson then took a shot at U.S. Sen. John Cornyn for sponsoring the bill, calling Cornyn a ""supposedly conservative senator from Texas"" and saying that the bill contributes to ""radical social change.""  The Juneteenth National Independence Day Act was carried by Cornyn and U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston. But despite its Texas origins, the bill drew opposition from some of the state’s own Republicans. Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Amarillo, said he doesn't support ""more days off for federal employees."" Rep. Chip Roy, a Hays County Republican, voted against the bill arguing that the name should be Juneteenth National Emancipation Day — not Juneteenth National Independence Day.   ""This name needlessly divides our nation on a matter that should instead bring us together by creating a separate Independence Day based on the color of one’s skin,"" Roy argued.   Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Houston, did not cast a vote.   Arguments of divisiveness aside, does the bill that recognizes Juneteenth as a federal holiday ""replace"" or ""supplant"" the Fourth of July Holiday, as Rosendale and Carlson claim?  A spokesperson for Fox News didn’t respond to our questions asking for rationale behind Carlson’s statement.  Rosendale’s spokesperson pointed to one example: a photo published by the Billings Gazette showing a Black man wearing a shirt the read ""Juneteenth 1865"" beneath ""July 4th"" crossed out in red ink. ""Thanks for proving my point,"" Rosendale said in a tweet highlighting the photo.   Another photo showing the full text of the man’s shirt shows that it also read, ""Because my ancestors weren’t free in 1776.""  Here is a photo of Mr. Robert Brown's entire shirt for context. Fact is, Mr. Brown's ancestors were not free in 1776. Why are you disrespecting this Veteran, @RepRosendale? #MTPol #MTNews #Juneteenth @billingsgazette @mtfreepress @democracynow pic.twitter.com/czPNPCIphD Writing for the Washington Examiner, Rosendale also pointed to a second example proving his replacement theory. He said that the city of Evanston, Ill. ""has canceled its Fourth of July parade and replaced it with a gay pride parade and Juneteenth parade.""   The event's official website says that the Trustees of the Evanston Fourth of July Association voted to cancel July Fourth celebrations ""based on concern for public health due to the unpredictability of the pandemic’s impact, vaccination rates, and in cooperation with our local authorities.""  One trustee told a local news station that the decision to cancel was made in March.   ""We made the decision in March based on the information that we had at that time,"" Trustee Jamie Black told Fox 6-TV. ""There are deadlines for permits and to secure the fireworks, as well as taking applications for the parade that happen early in the year.""  Nowhere in the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act does it mention replacing the Fourth of July federal holiday. The single-page act amends a section of Title 5 of the U.S. Code by inserting ‘‘Juneteenth National Independence Day, June 19"" after Memorial Day.  ""The bill has nothing to do with the federal holiday on July 4th and doesn’t address it legislatively in any way. It only designates June 19th as ‘Juneteenth National Independence Day,’ in addition to the other existing federal holidays. In other words, it simply adds a holiday; it does not supplant or eliminate an existing one at the same time,"" Cornyn’s spokesperson Drew Brandewie said. In a tweet, Cornyn also called the rationale behind Rosendale’s opposition to the bill ""kooky.""  The U.S. Senate passed the bill unanimously. Rosendale said in a June 16 tweet that the intent of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act is to ""replace the Fourth of July."" His claim was later echoed on Fox News by Tucker Carlson who said that the act will create ""a new Independence Day, to supplant the old one.""  The act only creates a new federal holiday on June 19 — the day that Union soldiers arrived in Galveston in 1865 to spread the news that slavery had been abolished.

Fact-checking a false Instagram post about Eric Trump, St. Jude fundraising
","An Instagram post highlighting Eric Trump’s charitable giving claimed that the second son of former President Donald Trump raised nearly $30 million for pediatric cancer treatment and research.  The bulk of the post appears to quote Eric Trump as contrasting media coverage of the Trump family with that of Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden. According to the post, Eric Trump said, ""As a person who raised nearly $30 million for children dying of cancer at St. Jude before the age of 30 (with the lowest expense ratio of any charity in the country), I am utterly disgusted by the way the media continues to portray me and my entire family as villains."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We wanted to find out if the quote was both authentic and accurate in its claim about Eric Trump’s fundraising. While we did not find a record of him using those exact words, Trump did author two tweets in September 2020 that appear to be the basis for the Instagram post. On Sept. 7, Trump responded to a journalist’s criticism of his charity, tweeted, ""We raised nearly $25 million for St Jude before the age of 30 at one of the lowest expense ratios of any charity in the United States (9.2% to be exact)."" About two weeks later, he tweeted, ""Raised nearly 25 Million Dollars by +/- age 30 for sick children at St. Jude Yet we are the ones attacked, subpoenaed & blundered while crooked Hunter [Biden] is ignored by all.""  In 2016, Trump said his foundation had raised a lower amount: $16.3 million.  Trump established the Eric Trump Foundation in 2007 as a public charity to raise money for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Tennessee. In 2016, Trump, then 32 years old, announced that he would cease ""all fundraising efforts"" for the foundation. This was a voluntary decision to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest during his father’s presidency, he said.  Trump at the time said his charity since its establishment had raised $16.3 million for St. Jude. In 2016, St. Jude officials confirmed this figure in a letter sent to Trump’s charity and provided by Trump to the New York Times. The newspaper reported that the letter said Trump’s foundation had raised or helped raise through affiliated groups $16.3 million. Publicly available tax records from 2007 to 2016 list that the charity itself directly donated $8.7 million. The discrepancy — between $16.3 million and $8.7 million — may be attributed to the direct donations made by the charity and the funds received by donors in connection with the charity’s fundraising efforts.  In 2017, Trump’s foundation restructured and rebranded as Curetivity. It has continued to raise money for St. Jude. None of its seven current board members are part of the Trump family.  Curetivity’s website says that the foundation has raised $25 million for St. Jude, which includes $14 million in direct contributions and the remainder in donors’ contributions connected to the foundation’s fundraising efforts.  The Curetivity Foundation did not respond to our requests for more information, nor did Trump when we tried to reach him through the Trump Organization. An Instagram post claimed Trump said he ""raised nearly $30 million for children dying of cancer at St. Jude before the age of 30.""  We found no evidence that the post accurately quoted Trump. The statement itself is also not accurate —  according to both Trump and St. Jude officials, the Eric Trump Foundation actually raised closer to half of that before Trump stepped down from his leadership role when he was 32.  The restructured foundation, Curetivity, remains in operation and has continued to raise money for St. Jude.​ We rate this claim as False. ","[('Instagram post, June 10, 2021', 'https://www.instagram.com/p/CP8OAwJAcVM/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=bde4d6cb-4975-4148-ae37-a30dcb27d186'), ('Twitter post, September 8, 2020\xa0', 'No link'), ('Twitter post, September 25, 2020', 'https://twitter.com/EricTrump/status/1303136208076312577'), ('ProPublica NonProfit Explorer, The Curetivity Foundation', 'No link'), ('Forbes, ""How Donald Trump Shifted Kids-Cancer Charity Money Into His Business,"" June 28, 2017', 'https://twitter.com/EricTrump/status/1309525992256548870'), ('Forbes, ""New York Attorney General Looking Into Eric Trump Foundation,"" June 9, 2017', 'No link'), ('Forbes, ""New Filings Show Donations To Eric Trump’s Foundation Plunged Amid Scandal,"" January 8, 2019', 'https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/208669454'), ('Charity Navigator, ""The Curetivity Foundation""', 'No link'), ('The Eric Trump Foundation', 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2017/06/06/how-donald-trump-shifted-kids-cancer-charity-money-into-his-business/?sh=526775686b4a'), ('Curetivity Foundation', 'No link'), ('The Curetivity Foundation, IRS 990 Tax Form, 2017', 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2017/06/09/new-york-attorney-general-looking-into-eric-trump-foundation/?sh=20bf240c1075'), ('New York Times,\xa0 ""Hospital Confirms Eric Trump Helped Raise $16.3 Million for It,"" January 6, 2017', 'No link'), ('Associated Press, ""Eric Trump’s charity remains under investigation,"" June 15, 2018', 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2019/01/08/donations-to-eric-trumps-foundation-plunged-amid-scandal/?sh=56b9d94a4f4d')]",/factchecks/2021/jun/25/instagram-posts/fact-checking-false-instagram-post-about-eric-trum/

Republicans mislead in welfare attack on Raphael Warnock
","A voting rights bill authored by Democrats includes a provision — to provide public financing of campaigns in some circumstances — that Republicans have derided as ""welfare."" After the For the People Act failed to proceed in the Senate, the National Republican Senatorial Committee launched an ad attacking Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., for supporting the legislation. (Warnock won his Senate seat in a special election this year and would be up for re-election in 2022.) ""He voted for welfare for politicians plan,"" says the narrator. ""Up to $25 million of government money for Warnock’s own political campaign."" A slip of paper resembling a receipt includes the text ""SR1"" — the only clue that the ad refers to the For the People Act.  The NRSC didn’t respond to our queries seeking evidence, but it looks like they are referring to a provision that provides public matching to small dollar donations to Senate campaigns. (There is a similar counterpart in the House legislation.) The law isn’t ""welfare,"" and the $25 million estimate is based on a maximum match. The For the People Act combines proposals for voter registration, absentee voting, in-person voting, campaign finance and ethics related to federal elections. The House passed the bill earlier this year. The Senate voted 50-50 along party lines on a motion to proceed on the bill June 22, falling short of the needed 60 votes to move ahead. Technically that was a procedural motion and not a vote on the bill itself, but it’s fair to call Warnock a supporter, because he is a co-sponsor of the previous version of the legislation. Although the bill is dead for now, politicians in both parties are continuing to talk about voting laws in advance of the midterms. Democrats want federal legislation to expand voting rights, while Republicans have argued that state lawmakers are the best equipped to set election laws for their states. One goal of the For the People Act is to reduce the power of big donors. The legislation includes a provision for small dollar financing of Senate election campaigns, which would provide a six-to-one match for each donation in aggregate under $200. For example, if a person donated $100 to a candidate, that would result in $600 in matching funds. The idea is to reduce the role of wealthy large donors in financing political campaigns. Senate candidates who want to participate would opt in and have to meet certain criteria, such as not accepting other donations over $1,000. The matching dollars would come from a new ""Freedom From Influence Fund"" — which would come from 4.75% surcharges on federal criminal offenses and settlements. If the amount in the fund comes up short, such matching dollars would be provided on a pro-rata basis. The legislation states: ""No taxpayer funds may be deposited into the fund."" The matching program would not start until 2028, which means that Warnock isn’t eligible to get any money from it for his 2022 election. Experts on the bill or campaign finance didn’t generally object to the math. The legislation includes a formula and caps that would determine how much a Senate candidate could get in matching dollars. This amount varies state by state because it takes into account the state’s size based on how many congressional districts it has.  The Brennan Center for Justice, a group that supports the legislation, did the math for Georgia and found it would add up to about $23.8 million — but if a candidate also got the enhanced matching funds, that would result in an extra $2.1 million, said Dan Weiner, deputy director of the Brennan Center’s Election Reform Program. But this includes the assumption that in 2028 the race would be competitive and that Warnock would raise the maximum amount.  Warnock hasn’t said if he would participate in the public financing program. Warnock raised about $124 million for his 2020 campaign, about half from small donors. If such legislation passes in the future, his opponents could use it, too. ""Both Republicans and Democrats have developed robust networks of small dollar donors, and both parties could use the program to amplify the voices of those grassroots supporters,"" said Brendan M. Fischer, director of the federal reform program at the Campaign Legal Center, an organization that supports the legislation. The NRSC called the program ""welfare"" in the ad attacking Warnock, who is Black, but not in a similar ad against Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H, who is white.  Generally the term ""welfare"" is used to refer to government dollars given to low-income people to help them pay for rent, clothes, food or other basic living expenses. A small dollar matching program to encourage candidates to focus on donations from average Americans rather than millionaires isn’t comparable to welfare. ""I do not think the ‘welfare for politicians’ phrase is accurate,"" said Michael Malbin, a University at Albany political scientist and expert on campaign finance. ""This is a subsidy to enhance the value of small-dollar donors. It is not meant to, and would not, benefit politicians directly."" The idea of small donor matching programs is not new — and it is not only for Democrats.  Presidential candidates from both major parties used a presidential public financing program between 1976 and 2008 until it became outdated, said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, an organization that promotes democracy. That includes former President Ronald Reagan, a Republican. ""If they are claiming this is welfare for politicians, they are claiming Reagan was a beneficiary of welfare for politicians, because he used the system run in 1976 when he lost and in 1980 and 1984 when he won,"" Wertheimer said. Wertheimer was involved in crafting the public financing law in the 1970s, as well as the provisions in the For the People Act. For decades, multiple states have provided their own campaign public financing programs. For example, Florida voters in 1998 approved a constitutional amendment for matching funds for statewide campaigns. In 2018, Republican Ron DeSantis, who won the governor’s race, received more than any other candidate in matching funds, nearly $3.23 million. His opponent, Democrat Andrew Gillum, received $2.62 million from the program. The NRSC ad says Warnock ""voted for welfare for politicians plan. Up to $25 million of government money for Warnock’s own political campaign."" It’s inaccurate to call the public financing for political campaigns ""welfare."" The goal of public campaign finance is to reduce the influence of rich donors and give more power to average Americans who want to donate to campaigns. That’s not comparable to ""welfare"" programs designed to help poor people with basic living expenses. Also, unlike programs associated with welfare, the public financing program would not come from tax dollars but surcharges on legal cases and settlements.  The claim is also speculative. Warnock hasn’t said if he would choose to opt into the program, which wouldn’t go into effect until a 2028 campaign cycle. Warnock first has to win re-election in 2022 under existing campaign finance rules.  We rate this statement False.

There's no Trump cease-and-desist order against vaccines
","TikTok users are sharing an audio recording of a woman telling people to share false information about former President Donald Trump. According to the audio, ""a lot of stuff went down over Memorial weekend"" — including the installation of a new (yet familiar) president and a halt to the nation’s vaccination effort. ""The main thing that I want to let you know, and I want y’all to share it and get the information out there — President Trump, and we know he’s the legal president. He was acknowledged by General Flynn and the military as the Commander in Chief of the United States republic,"" the audio says.

(Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with TikTok.) The recording makes ridiculous claims. First, Biden won the election and is the ""legal"" president. Biden remains in power since his January inauguration. Biden won 306 electoral votes in total to Trump’s 232, which is less than the required 270 or higher needed to win. Congress formally certified the electoral results on Jan. 6, despite the storming of the Capitol that day by rioters who supported Trump’s false claims of fraud. A Defense Department duty officer refuted the first portion of the TikTok claim, stating that Biden is the commander in chief.  We looked and did not find any record of Trump issuing such an order against COVID-19 vaccines, when he was president, or since.

Anthony Fauci did not privately back hydroxychloroquine to family while questioning it publicly
","Some social media users are seeking to tar Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as a hypocrite for how he handled his high-profile role as a scientific expert during the coronavirus pandemic. A June 21 post claimed to have found a smoking gun in a batch of emails that Fauci sent early in the pandemic that were obtained by BuzzFeed and the Washington Post through a Freedom of Information Act request and published June 1. According to the text of the Facebook post, ""One of Fauci's most incredible emails is the one in which he advises a family member to use hydroxychlorichin (sic) and antibiotic therapy, the same evening in which in a press conference he attacked (President Donald Trump) on the usefulness of hydroxychlorichin (sic) to fight the virus.""   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We looked through the searchable database of Fauci’s publicly released emails and found some references to hydroxychloroquine, but nothing that matched the duplicity alleged in the Facebook post. All told, we found no indication that Fauci’s private comments were inconsistent with his public views of the drug, including what he said at White House press briefings. The post was referring to hydroxychloroquine, a drug that’s well-established in the treatment of lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and malaria and which attracted attention early in the pandemic as a possible treatment of COVID-19.  In early 2020, two small trials, including one that used hydroxychloroquine along with the antibiotic azithromycin, reported that the virus was essentially gone in five days. But the research society that published that article later renounced it, saying it didn’t meet its standards. Then-President Donald Trump championed the drug, despite skepticism from many medical experts, including Fauci, who cautioned that the evidence of the drug’s efficacy was anecdotal and needed to be confirmed by high-quality studies, especially since the drug carries a particular risk for people with heart problems, as well as other possible side effects. A clinical trial was conducted by the National Institutes of Health to see whether the drug could be used as a treatment for COVID-19. The study was halted in June 2020 after it found hydroxychloroquine was ""very unlikely to be beneficial to hospitalized patients with COVID-19."" Soon after, the Food and Drug Administration revoked a three-month-old emergency use authorization for the drug for the treatment of COVID-19. The FDA said taking the drug could potentially lead to serious side effects including ""serious cardiac adverse events"" and that any potential benefits ""no longer outweigh the known and potential risks."" Hydroxychloroquine was specifically mentioned almost three-dozen times in Fauci’s emails, usually due to someone asking Fauci for his thoughts on the drug. At no point in any of the publicly available emails sent by Fauci did he conclude that hydroxychloroquine was an effective treatment, much less urge a close relative to start using it.  On Feb. 24, 2020, a pharmacologist at the federal Food and Drug Administration asked Fauci whether there was any proof to back up a claim from China about hydroxychloroquine being able to ""decrease COVID-19 infections and lung disease."" ""There are no data in this brief report and so I have no way of evaluating their claim. There are a lot of these types of claims going around. I would love to see their data,"" Fauci responded. In several subsequent emails asking about the drug, Fauci acknowledged the existence of anecdotal accounts about hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness but said he was waiting on high-quality studies, like the one NIH was conducting. On April 23, 2020, NIH press staff sent Fauci an email seeking to finalize language for a press release that said in his name, ""Although there is anecdotal evidence that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin may benefit people with COVID-19, we need solid data from a large randomized, controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes.""  In his response to the email, Fauci wrote that the draft language ""looks fine."" Fauci’s emails echoed statements he made publicly about the drug, which were to withhold any official position until a controlled clinical trial was complete. His most extensive comments on hydroxychloroquine from the White House briefing room were in March 2020. At the time, a reporter asked Fauci about whether there was evidence that hydroxychloroquine might be effective against the coronavirus.  ""The answer is no,"" Fauci responded, adding that the reporter was talking about anecdotal evidence that ""was not done in a controlled clinical trial, so you really can't make any definitive statement about it.""  Fauci’s remarks the following day, March 21, took the same approach: ""The president is talking about hope for people. And it's not an unreasonable thing: to hope for people. So when you have approved drugs that physicians have the option and a decision between the physician and the patient, are you going to use a drug that someone says, from an anecdotal standpoint, not completely proven, but might have some effect? There are those who lean to the point of giving hope and saying, ‘Give that person the option of having access to that drug.’  ""And then you have the other group — which is my job, as a scientist — to say my job is to ultimately prove, without a doubt, that a drug is not only safe, but that it actually works. Those two things are really not incompatible, when you think about that, particularly when you're in an arena where you don't have anything that's proven."" A Facebook post said that one of Fauci's ""most incredible emails is the one in which he advises a family member to use (hydroxychloroquine) and antibiotic therapy, the same evening in which in a press conference he attacked (Trump) on the usefulness of  (hydroxychloroquine) to fight the virus."" We found nothing in Fauci’s publicly disclosed emails that supports the claim that he urged a close relative to use hydroxychloroquine. To the contrary, Fauci in his emails was consistent in arguing, both publicly and privately, that anecdotal evidence supporting hydroxychloroquine’s efficacy in the pandemic would need to be demonstrated in a controlled clinical trial before its use could be recommended. We rate the statement False.

The WHO did not reverse its position on kids and COVID-19 vaccines
","A social media post on Instagram claims that the World Health Organization recently flipped its policy recommendation about children receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. ""The WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION recently reversed its stance on children getting the Covid vaccine. Sorry to all those dumb parents who rushed out to get their 12 year olds vaccinated. Oops you injected your kids with poison and it’s no longer recommended. Personally no one should but at least save the children!,"" the post reads. A photo posted alongside the caption is a screenshot from the World Health Organization’s website, with the words circled in red: ""Children should not be vaccinated for the moment."" The screen grab also shows the following paragraph with the words underlined in red: ""There is not yet enough evidence on the use of vaccines against COVID-19 in children to make recommendations for children to be vaccinated against COVID-19."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (Read more about PolitiFact’s partnership with Facebook.) Others have been spreading similar messages on social media about this alleged change in the WHO’s stance on COVID-19 vaccines for children, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). The topic also dominated vaccine-related Google searches on June 22, according to Google Trends data. The screen grab posted on Instagram was indeed taken directly from the WHO’s webpage and the text had not been altered. The purpose of that specific webpage is to give the public advice on who should receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The webpage stated, ""Children should not be vaccinated for the moment."" However, this was not new guidance from the WHO. The organization first posted this guidance on April 8, according to our analysis of the webpage through the Wayback Machine, an internet archive service, and First Draft, a nonprofit group that analyzes misinformation on the web. When we reached out to the WHO on June 22 to ask officials about the webpage’s wording and whether they had reversed their stance, a spokesperson sent the following statement: ""Children and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults, so unless they are part of a group at higher risk of severe COVID-19, it is less urgent to vaccinate them than older people, those with chronic health conditions and health workers. ""More evidence is needed on the use of the different COVID-19 vaccines in children to be able to make general recommendations on vaccinating children against COVID-19. ""WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has concluded that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is suitable for use by people aged 12 years and above. Children aged between 12 and 15 who are at high risk may be offered this vaccine alongside other priority groups. Vaccine trials for children are ongoing and WHO will update its recommendations when the evidence or epidemiological situation warrants a change in policy. ""It's important for children to continue to have the recommended childhood vaccines."" The WHO updated its webpage June 23, replacing the language, ""children should not be vaccinated for the moment,"" with the precise language sent in the statement above. Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at KFF, said she reached out to a WHO contact who told her this updated language was added to reflect the latest advice from the WHO’s June 15 meeting of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts, which said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can be given to those age 12 and older. The WHO’s chief scientist, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, explained in a June 11 video why the WHO was not prioritizing COVID-19 vaccines for children. ""So, the reason that today, in June 2021, WHO is saying that vaccinating children is not a priority is because children, though they can get infected with COVID-19 and they can transmit the infection to others, they are at much lower risk of getting severe disease compared to older adults,"" Swaminathan said. ""And that is why, when we started prioritizing people who should get the vaccination when there are limited supplies of vaccines available in the country, we recommend that we start with health care workers and front-line workers who are at very high risk of exposure to the infection. Also elderly, the people who have underlying illnesses that make them at high risk to develop severe disease."" Dr. Rachel Vreeman, director of the Arnhold Institute for Global Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital, confirmed that the statements on WHO’s webpage were focused on whom to prioritize most urgently in getting COVID-19 vaccines. ""They are not saying that children should not be vaccinated against COVID or that the vaccines currently approved for use in children 12 years old and above are not safe,"" Vreeman wrote in an email. ""The WHO is saying that the global priority should be on getting more adults vaccinated, since older adults are at the highest risk of serious complications and death from COVID-19."" ""In the face of massive inequities in who has access to COVID-19 vaccines globally, the WHO advises that those at highest risk — older adults — be prioritized first,"" Vreeman wrote. It’s also important to consider that supplies of the COVID-19 vaccines are no longer limited in the U.S., as they are in other parts of the world. So, having to ration the vaccine for only health care workers or those who are older or at higher risk for severe disease does not apply here. Remember, the WHO is a global organization, so its recommendations need to be applicable to countries worldwide. In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone age 12 and over should receive a COVID-19 vaccine. In the U.S., the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been authorized for emergency use in children ages 12 through 18 and adults of all ages. The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends that children age 12 and up receive a COVID-19 vaccine. So does Vreeman, who is a pediatrician. ""As a pediatrician in the United States, in a setting where the COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, I whole-heartedly recommend that children 12 years old and up receive the COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible,"" Vreeman wrote in an email. ""The data show that the vaccines are safe and effective for this age group, and we want to prevent the risks that COVID-19 does present to children."" An Instagram post and other posts across social media falsely claimed that the WHO recently reversed its stance on children receiving a COVID-19 vaccine because the vaccines were ""poison"" and would be dangerous for children. The WHO first posted its guidance for children and COVID-19 vaccinations on April 8. That guidance did include the wording, ""Children should not be vaccinated for the moment."" But, that wording was a reflection of the WHO saying that children should not be prioritized for vaccinations over other groups because in many countries supplies of vaccine are limited and health care workers, front-line workers, the elderly and those with high-risk medical conditions should have first dibs. There’s no evidence the WHO ""reversed"" its position on childhood COVID-19 vaccination in the way the viral social media posts allege.

Trump’s Pants on Fire distortion about Georgia’s voter rolls
","Former President Donald Trump distorted Georgia’s plans to remove ineligible voters, wrongly suggesting that the state failed to keep the voter rolls up to date before the 2020 election and that therefore, he won. Trump’s claim alludes to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s announcement that the state plans to remove 101,789 people from its voter rolls, largely those who have since moved. While that effort is routine, Trump cast it as suspicious. ""But what about the last election? Why wasn’t this done prior to the November 3rd presidential election where they had us losing by a very small number of votes, many times less than the 101,789 figure?"" Trump said in a June 22 statement from his Save America PAC. ""This means we (you!) won the Presidential Election in Georgia.  Trump ended with a familiar refrain: ""The 2020 presidential election was rigged!"" Trump’s repeated statements that he won the presidential election in Georgia or nationally or that it was rigged are Pants on Fire wrong.  Trump’s latest claim, that the removal of more than 100,000 people from the voter rolls suggests something nefarious about the 2020 election, ignores the reality. State officials nationwide are in the process of removing ineligible voters. ""This is happening across the U.S. in every state, and it is focused on voters who literally did not vote in 2020,"" said Amber McReynolds, CEO of Vote at Home Institute. ""So, Trump clearly does not understand federal law or election processes or procedures.""  We asked Trump’s Save America PAC for evidence to back up his statements and did not get a reply. Nationwide, voter rolls constantly change. New people register to vote or people are removed after they move away, die, or in some states, after they are convicted of certain crimes.  State election officials have programs in place to keep voter rolls up to date. These efforts aren’t perfect — sometimes states make errors. But states have gotten better at working together on this front — many, including Georgia, are members of the Electronic Registration Information Center, which shares information about voters. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires states to complete a program to remove ineligible voters who have moved not later than 90 days before a federal election. Some removals can still take place within the 90-day window, such as voters who have died. Georgia election officials removed dead voters throughout 2020. Due to the 90-day rule, states generally avoid mass removals during federal election years. ""Many states, including Georgia, do these activities in odd-numbered years, as this also means that if anyone was inadvertently removed, they have plenty of time to re-register before the next federal election,"" said David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research. Raffensperger announced in June that most of the people slated for removal from Georgia’s voter rolls had moved — they had submitted a change of address form to the post office or had election mail returned. These individuals had no contact with elections officials in the past two general elections.  Election officials plan to send people a notice that they will be removed and give them 40 days to respond. People who are eventually removed can re-register if they are eligible. The number of voters flagged for removal is smaller than previous years. In 2019, the state removed about 290,000 voters, and in 2017 about 670,000.  Additionally, about 18,000 people who have died are being removed from the voter rolls. Trump is wrong to claim that these removals of voters means that he won the election in Georgia. Raffensperger and Gabriel Sterling, also a Republican and a state elections official, stand by Georgia’s election procedures, which affirmed Joe Biden’s victory in the state. The roughly 5 million ballots cast in Georgia were counted three times, including once by hand. The hand recount uncovered more than 2,600 uncounted votes, most of which favored Trump, in Floyd County. But election officials said the mistake was due to human error, not voter or election fraud. In the end, the certified results showed Biden beat Trump by 11,779 votes in Georgia. Congress accepted the results Jan. 6.  Trump said Georgia didn’t update its voter rolls prior to the 2020 presidential election and ""this means we (you!) won the presidential election in Georgia."" Trump is wrong on both counts. Federal law requires states to establish programs to keep voter rolls up to date. To comply with the law, Georgia and other states routinely handle such removals in non-federal election years. In 2019, the state removed about 290,000 voters. In 2021, the state is on track to remove about 100,000 voters. The removal of voters who have moved, died or are otherwise ineligible is a routine occurrence, and it doesn’t change this fact: Georgia election officials certified the results showing that Trump lost.

Despite popular misconception, Supreme Court 9-0 rulings aren’t that rare
","In one of the final decisions of its current term, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled against the National Collegiate Athletic Association in a closely watched case, concluding that the NCAA could not prevent certain payments to college athletes, thus putting the longstanding amateur model of college sports in jeopardy. After the ruling was announced, Trey Wingo, a former ESPN host and commentator, sent a tweet that sought to encapsulate how stunning the Supreme Court’s 9-0 decision was. ""A 9-0 Supreme Court ruling is the equivalent of finding a unicorn and a Yeti at the same time under a rainbow with a pot of gold and they’re both speaking 3 languages,"" Wingo tweeted on June 21. A 9-0 Supreme Court ruling is the equivalent of finding a unicorn and a Yeti at the same time under a rainbow with a pot of gold and they’re both speaking 3 languages https://t.co/o9LGdOcE1C That’s quite a way to say that something is ""rare."" But the reality is the opposite: 9-0 rulings are the most common types of Supreme Court rulings, year after year. While 5-4 rulings attract the most attention from the public and the media, there’s a good chance that a larger number of cases you never heard about were decided on a unanimous basis. Wingo’s tweet ""reflects the common misperception that the court is hopelessly split,"" said Ilya Shapiro, a vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute and a Supreme Court watcher. ""The cases that make the front pages, or the digital-era equivalent, aren’t the 9-0 rulings on bankruptcy law or personal jurisdiction but rather the culture-war controversies that do tend to be 5-4."" Wingo did not respond to an inquiry via Twitter.  Experts told us that the most complete data on Supreme Court decisions is tallied by the publication SCOTUSBlog. We looked at their data since 2008 for 9-0 rulings, 5-4 rulings, and other ruling combinations. Between 2008 and 2019, which is the last year for which SCOTUSBlog has published the data, the percentage of all Supreme Court rulings that were 9-0 ranged from a low of 36% and a high of 66%. (Technical note: These figures include rulings in which justices voted with the majority but may have written their own opinions to explain their reasoning.) By contrast, the percentage of 5-4 rulings ranged from 5% and 29%. And the percentage of rulings with any other numerical breakdown ranged from 20% to 51%. In the term that ran from the fall of 2018 to the summer of 2019, the breakdown was 36% 9-0 rulings, 21% 5-4 rulings, and 43% any other ruling. Put a different way, in most years, the share of 9-0 rulings amounted to a plurality. Even in the years when it wasn’t a plurality, 9-0 rulings accounted for 30% to 40% of decisions. Legal experts said Wingo’s misconception is understandable. ""The close splits may be fewer, but they are more often in high-profile cases with a broader impact and that affect the rights of more people,"" said Sarah E. Turberville, director of the Constitution Project at the Project On Government Oversight. Indeed, there’s a bit of circular logic feeding the misunderstanding. ""High-profile cases tend to be high-profile precisely because they are about divisive issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, affirmative action, and church-state relations,"" said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Volokh added that the 9-0 decision in the case involving the NCAA may have been surprising because it was a high-profile issue but one on which there was not a lot of legal disagreement. ""It involved a question that’s of practical interest to the public, but not because it involved some deeply felt legal divide,"" he said. ""It’s thus unsurprising that the justices agreed on the legal question."" Another high-profile 9-0 decision from June was Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, which held that Philadelphia violated constitutionally protected religious freedom when it refused to contract with Catholic Social Services for foster care services unless the group agreed to certify same-sex couples as foster parents.  The Fulton case offers another example that even high-profile rulings do not necessarily fall ""on clear partisan lines,"" said Anthony Marcum, a resident fellow at the R Street Institute, a right-of-center think tank. Wingo said, ""A 9-0 Supreme Court ruling is the equivalent of finding a unicorn and a Yeti at the same time under a rainbow with a pot of gold and they’re both speaking 3 languages."" In truth, 9-0 rulings aren’t rare at all. In the past decade, they accounted for a plurality of rulings and never fell below 36% of all rulings. They are more common than 5-4 rulings. Experts said it’s easy to understand why this misperception is so common, since many of the 9-0 rulings are on technical cases that don’t receive as much attention as the more dramatic 5-4 splits.

No, the WHO isn’t trying to ban women ages 18-50 from drinking alcohol
","A proposed global action plan on alcohol consumption put together by the World Health Organization is being criticized after some believed the health agency was effectively trying to ban women ""of childbearing age"" from being able to drink alcohol. ""World Health Organization wants to BAN all women aged 18-50 from drinking alcohol,"" reads the headline of a June 17 article by the Irish Post. The WHO defines ""reproductive age"" as 15-49. This is a distortion of the report’s purpose. It argued for heightened attention to alcohol intake among pregnant women and women of childbearing age, as well as other groups, but it did not propose any strict alcohol ban, nor could it enforce one  The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The WHO released the first draft of the report on June 15, titled the ""Global alcohol action plan 2022-2030."" The campaign aims to help lessen the harmful effects of certain levels of alcohol consumption around the world. The report only mentions pregnancy and women of childbearing age one time, and it’s in the context of raising awareness about alcohol-related issues:  ""Appropriate attention should be given to prevention of the initiation of drinking among children and adolescents, prevention of drinking among pregnant women and women of childbearing age, and protection of people from pressures to drink, especially in societies with high levels of alcohol consumption where heavy drinkers are encouraged to drink even more."" It also notes that, ""one of the most dramatic manifestations of harm to persons other than drinkers is prenatal alcohol exposure and the development of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders."" The WHO released a statement to fact-checking organization Full Fact to clarify the report, saying its goal is to bring attention to the consumption of alcohol while pregnant, even when the pregnancy is not known. ""The current draft of WHO's global action plan does not recommend abstinence of all women who are of an age at which they could become pregnant,"" the statement says. ""However it does seek to raise awareness of the serious consequences that can result from drinking alcohol while pregnant, even when the pregnancy is not yet known."" The report includes other groups, like children and adolescents, and lays out eight action areas and aims to raise awareness about alcohol-related issues, with proposed initiatives like a ""World no alcohol day/week"" to focus and reinforce public attention. An article headline claims that the WHO is trying to ban all women between the ages of 18 and 50 from drinking alcohol. This is an exaggeration of the WHO’s draft report. The report suggested more monitoring of alcohol consumption in some women due to the deleterious effects it can have on a fetus. But the organization did not propose that women between those ages should be banned from drinking alcohol entirely, neither could it enforce such a ban. We rate this claim False.

Manipulated video distorts Greta Thunberg’s comments on climate change
","With a little video manipulation, you can make someone appear to say something they never meant. That’s what the Instagram user Republican Party News did with a clip of teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg. Thunberg — the Swede that Time Magazine named 2019 Person of the Year — was interviewed March 7 on Mehdi Hasan’s MSNBC show. A June 21 Instagram post from Republican Party News (which is not the official GOP party account) wrote this caption for its cut of the video: ""Greta says climate change doesn’t exist."" The video quickly garnered nearly 165,000 views. In it, Hasan asks Thunberg what she would tell President Joe Biden to do. ""I would just tell him to tell the situation as it is,"" Thunberg says in the clip. ""Since the climate crisis doesn’t exist, how can we expect people to want climate action?"" A careful viewer would notice Thunberg’s image jump ever so slightly between the two sentences. Because that’s where one of two edits occurred. What Thunberg actually emphasized was the need for leaders to tell voters that the climate crisis is an existential threat. Here is the transcript of Thunberg’s complete answer. Marked in bold are the sentences that the Instagram post cut out. Hasan: ""Is there a specific policy goal if he rang you up and said Greta, what should I do? I can wave a presidential magic wand, what should I do that I’m not? What would you say?""  Thunberg: ""Nothing because that's not democratic. I mean, an elected leader cannot do anything without support from voters. And I would not want anyone to do anything that would not have the support, because that would be undemocratic and democracy is the most precious thing that we have and we must not risk that. ""So, what we need now is to raise awareness. To create public opinion. To treat the crisis like a crisis. Because if people are not aware of the crisis that we face, of course, they won’t put pressure on the elected leaders. So, I would just tell him to tell the situation as it is. Because I mean, yes, you could say, I meet with a lot of world leaders and they say ‘I can't do anything because I don't have the support from voters.’ Well, how can you expect support and pressure from voters if you aren’t treating the crisis like a crisis — since the climate crisis doesn’t exist, how can we expect people to want climate action?"" You can compare the videos for yourself. Here’s the manipulated video: Here’s the actual video: An Instagram user edited an interview to make it seem that Thunberg said that ""the climate crisis doesn’t exist.""

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) People who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Mutations of the virus have also become more easily transmissible and can cause more severe symptoms among unvaccinated people. A surge in Oregon among the state's unvaccinated population is a result of the Alpha variant, while Colorado has seen the Delta variant account for 40% of the state’s new infections in populations with low vaccination rates. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a June 8 briefing it was vital that people in the United States get vaccinated against COVID-19 to prevent a surge of the Delta variant similar to the one being experienced in the United Kingdom. The U.K. surge is due to its unvaccinated population, particularly children and young adults, according to him. ""In the UK, the Delta variant is rapidly emerging as the dominant variant — greater than 60%,"" Fauci said. ""The transmission is peaking in the younger group of 12- to 20-year-olds — mainly that group that we’re concerned about here, about making sure they get vaccinated."" Around 45% of people in the United States have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and about 53% of the population has received their first dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the number of new cases, hospitalizations and deaths related to COVID-19 has been on a steady decline on a national level since mass vaccinations began earlier this year, the same can’t be said if vaccinated people were completely out of the equation. A study by the Washington Post found that among unvaccinated people, the national death rate has remained the same since April, and the hospitalization rate is still just as high as it was in March. On a state-by-state level, places like Florida and New Jersey have a 50% higher death rate for unvaccinated people, according to the Post. In Washington, D.C. and Michigan, unvaccinated people are twice as likely to be hospitalized because of the virus. Although no vaccine is 100% effective, the protection provided by the three vaccines currently being used in the United States significantly reduces the risk of serious infection from the virus.  There have been some instances where people got COVID-19 after being fully vaccinated. These ""breakthrough"" cases are expected, the CDC said, ""especially before population immunity reaches sufficient levels to further decrease transmission."" However, despite these breakthrough infections, the CDC has said the vaccines still ""offer protection against most variants currently spreading in the United States."" A Facebook post claims, ""the unvaccinated have escaped every single strain or 'variant’"" of the coronavirus. Unvaccinated people are highly susceptible to contracting COVID-19, including from emerging variants.  We rate this claim False.","[('Facebook post, May 15, 2021', 'https://www.facebook.com/rob.oosterom.75/posts/2924457034479230'), ('Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC COVID Data Tracker, accessed June 21, 2021', 'No link'), ('The Washington Post, ""The unseen covid-19 risk for unvaccinated people,"" May 28', 'https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations'), ('USA Today, ""People hospitalized with COVID-19 now have one overwhelming thing in common.

Yes, Gov. Newsom Has the Authority to Continue California’s State of Emergency, Legal Experts Say
","Amid a game show backdrop, Gov. Gavin Newsom said early this month that California’s state of emergency is here to stay for now, even as the Golden State moved forward with its reopening plans. Days after the announcement, a prominent anti-mask activist from Orange County questioned whether the governor has the power to keep the emergency declaration in place. A video on Facebook from Peggy Hall, a former teacher who runs the anti-mask and anti-vaccination website The Healthy American, claims that Newsom ""has no power or authority"" to extend the state of emergency and that the measure expired on May 6, 2020, 60 days after the governor first made the emergency declaration.  A screenshot from The Healthy American website.  The video, which was initially posted live from Hall’s account, refers to Newsom — who’s running in a recall election — as ""the Gavinor"" and ""the soon-to-be ex-governor of California."" More than 8,000 people have viewed it on Facebook, which flagged the video as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.)  So does Newsom have the legal authority to extend California’s state of emergency, even with restrictions loosening across the state? We decided to find out. The state of emergency in California Newsom first declared a statewide emergency over the COVID-19 pandemic on March 4, 2020. The announcement came hours after California’s first confirmed death from the virus, although public health officials later linked several earlier deaths to COVID-19. Put simply, a state of emergency is a government declaration that allows public officials to change usual operations and order actions to respond to an unfolding crisis. The declaration also helps the state government access federal aid, unlock certain state resources and work with county and local officials to coordinate emergency responses on a regional level. When Newsom initially declared California’s state of emergency over the coronavirus, he said the measure would help the state prepare a robust healthcare response to the virus and curb outbreaks. He used the declaration and the state’s public health authority to make face coverings mandatory within California and change government rules to allow things like to-go cocktails. Later in the pandemic, Newsom used the emergency declaration to set up the state’s tiered reopening system, color-coding counties based on their number of active coronavirus cases and positivity rate. He also used it to award more than 100 no-bid contracts, including some to companies that donated to his campaign, according to a CapRadio investigation. How a state of emergency ends The rules surrounding state of emergency declarations are described in the California Emergency Services Act. According to the law, a state of emergency can be declared when ""conditions of disaster or of extreme peril"" exist. The law specifically classifies an ""epidemic"" as grounds for a state of emergency to be called. ""The authority to protect the public in times of health and safety threat has long been acknowledged and granted by the Supreme Court,"" said Michele Goodwin, a professor of law at UC Irvine and director of the Center for Biotechnology and Global Health Policy. Section 8629 of the act, titled ""Termination of state of emergency,"" states that the declaration should be ended at ""the earliest possible date that conditions warrant.""  Leslie Jacobs, a professor of constitutional law at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento and director of the Capital Center for Law & Policy, said the decision to end a state of emergency is ""largely left to the discretion of the governor."" But she also noted that a state of emergency can be ended in two ways: by the governor or by concurrent resolution in the state Legislature. The latter is a type of legislation that is typically used to resolve issues or express the sentiments of both the California State Assembly and Senate. ""The governor does not have absolute power to determine when to terminate the emergency because section 8629 states the emergency may be terminated by concurrent resolution of the Legislature declaring it at an end,"" Jacobs said. ""So, the two elected branches of the state government must agree that the emergency should continue."" There is also a check on Newsom’s power in the form of public opinion. Newsom has been criticized heavily by state Republicans for his response to COVID-19, fending off a lawsuit from two state lawmakers, and he will face a recall vote this year. In her video, Hall cites section 8627.5 of the California Emergency Services Act, which states that ""the temporary suspension of any statute, ordinance, regulation or rule"" will remain in effect until the suspension is rescinded by the governor, the state of emergency is terminated or a period of 60 days has passed, ""whichever occurs first."" Hall said in an email to PolitiFact that there are ""no grounds for the emergency according to law."" But that section of the law specifically refers to ""nonsafety regulations"" dealing with the delivery of food, pharmaceuticals and other necessities. Essentially, the section limits the amount of time Newsom can override local, county and state rules related to how supplies are distributed across the state – not how long a state of emergency can last. Jacobs said a state of emergency can last far longer than 60 days provided Newsom feels that crisis conditions persist and a majority of the state Legislature agrees. Why is Newsom keeping the state of emergency? Newsom’s announcement that he will extend California’s state of emergency while simultaneously taking steps to loosen restrictions and reopen the state might seem counterintuitive, but experts say there are a number of reasons it might be advantageous for him to do so. Jacobs said keeping the state of emergency allows Newsom to ""remain nimble and able to respond to changes"" as the pandemic progresses. Although vaccinations are now available for all California residents over the age of 12, roughly 45% of all Californians have yet to be fully vaccinated as of June 14.  If cases spike as the state reopens, the state of emergency will allow Newsom to reimpose restrictions if necessary. ""We’re still in a state of emergency,"" Newsom said on June 3. ""This disease has not been extinguished."" A state of emergency declaration also helps public officials use state assets and acquire federal aid to address issues that arise during reopening and help California recover from the pandemic. Sometimes, emergency declarations last years while an area recovers from a disaster — for instance, a state of emergency from the 2018 Camp Fire is still in effect today as affected localities rebuild. ""A number of declarations of emergencies related to fires and floods in recent years have extended beyond 60 days,"" Jacobs said. Our ruling A video on Facebook posted by a prominent Orange County anti-mask activist  claimed that Gov. Gavin Newsom doesn’t have the authority to extend California’s state of emergency. It further claimed that the state of emergency declaration ended on May 6, 2020, 60 days after it was initially announced. The video cited the California Emergency Services Act, which does set forth rules surrounding state of emergency declarations. However, the video cites a section of the law that is not relevant to the termination of the entire emergency declaration. Instead, the section deals with nonsafety regulations pertaining to the delivery of necessities. Under the correct portion of the California Emergency Services Act, section 8629, Newsom has broad discretion to decide when the state of emergency should be lifted in California. Under the law, a state of emergency should be lifted at ""the earliest possible date that conditions warrant."" It can be ended by Newsom or by concurrent resolution in the state Legislature. Legal experts say that many emergency declarations in recent years have lasted well beyond 60 days. According to experts, extending emergency declarations can help an area recover from a crisis because it enables state officials to continually adjust restrictions as needed and access state assets and federal aid. It’s clear that Newsom has legal authority to extend California’s state of emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.","[('Facebook video, June 7, 2021', 'https://www.facebook.com/peggy.hall1/videos/10222824602076499/'), ('CapRadio, California Coronavirus Updates, June 4, 2021', 'No link'), ('CapRadio, California Releases More Details On June 15 Reopening Plan, May 21, 2021', 'https://www.capradio.org/articles/2021/06/13/california-coronavirus-updates-june-2021/#wontliftstate'), ('Email interview with Leslie Jacobs, professor of constitutional law at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento and director of the Capital Center for Law & Policy, June 11, 2021', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Michele Goodwin, a professor of law at UC Irvine and director of the Center for Biotechnology and Global Health Policy, June 16, 2021', 'https://www.capradio.org/articles/2021/05/21/california-releases-more-details-on-june-15-reopening-plan/'), ('Email interview with Peggy Hall, founder of The Healthy American, June 11, 2021', 'No link'), ('California Office of the Governor, Governor Newsom Declares State of Emergency to Help State Prepare for Broader Spread of COVID-19, March 4, 2020', 'https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/04/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-to-help-state-prepare-for-broader-spread-of-covid-19/'), ('Cornell Law Library Legal Information Institute, State of emergency', 'No link'), ('San Francisco Chronicle, 1st US COVID-19 death was 57-year-old Santa Clara County woman, probe finds, April 24, 2020', 'https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/state_of_emergency'), ('Los Angeles Times, Essential Politics: California’s reopening confusion, June 7, 2021', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, Yes, Gov.

Liberty U. confuses its Kennedys: Louisiana senator, not ex-president talked tough on immigration
","John Kennedy was an eloquent orator whose quotations live on to this day. You probably remember some of them. ""If not us, who? If not now, when?"" ""Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country."" ""Do not pray for easy lives, pray to be stronger men."" And, of course, who could forget: ""There are people in Washington, D.C., in positions of power to whom the border is just a nuisance, and I think some of them believe that illegal immigration is a moral good. It is not.  Wait, what about that last one? A liberal lion who died nearly 60 years ago talking with a decidedly conservative tone? Yep, says a post from the Standing For Freedom Center, which meme-ified the quote with a picture of the former president. It added this caption: ""Illegal immigration is just that: illegal. It undermines what it means to be an American citizen and it threatens the well-being of the Americans already in our borders. We must not believe the left when they say that illegal immigration is good for our country."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Standing for Freedom Center is part of Liberty University, a conservative college in Virginia. In this case, the center could have used a class in fact-checking. The quote is definitely Kennedian … just not that one. It was made by U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, in 2019 during an interview with Fox News. The video is still attached to this story, so you can see it for yourself. The Louisiana Kennedy is not related to the former president.  As for John F. Kennedy, immigration was an important issue to him. His final book, published posthumously, was called ""A Nation of Immigrants."" In it, he writes, ""Everywhere immigrants have enriched and strengthened the fabric of American life."" The Standing for Freedom Center has the wrong man.
