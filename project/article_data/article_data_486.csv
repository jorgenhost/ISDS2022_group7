Council candidate errs about incumbent's resume
","An Atlanta City Council hopeful is attempting to raise his own profile by suggesting the incumbent is nowhere to be found at City Hall. Worse yet, she’s done little in her 12 years on the council. ""Where’s CARLA? Everyone’s present at City Hall, except CARLA,"" read a glossy flier by Bill Powell, who’s running for the District 1 seat on the council, currently represented by three-term veteran Carla Smith. Powell criticized Smith’s actions on some issues in the district and included a claim that seemed ripe for a fact check. ""This 12 year council ‘Seat-warmer’ has never chaired, vice chaired, or led a single Council committee meeting,"" Powell’s flier says. PolitiFact Georgia saw the flier earlier this week. The flier makes Smith appear to be a do-nothing councilwoman who needs to go, but the facts tell a vastly different story concerning whether or not she’s ever served as committee chair. The Atlanta City Council has seven committees to review legislation before it goes to a vote before the entire council. The committees typically meet twice a month at City Hall and listen to questions, concerns and criticism from residents about city services and pending legislation. The committees are community development/human resources, finance, public safety, transportation, utilities, zoning and the Committee on Council, which deals with council administrative issues. Each committee has a chair and a vice chair. The positions are appointed by the council’s president and serve throughout a calendar year. Committee chairs hold some power because they can allow or deny legislation to come up for a vote. In short, they’re important positions. Smith was first elected to the council in 2001. Her east Atlanta district includes neighborhoods such as Grant Park, Lakewood and Peoplestown as well as citywide attractions, Zoo Atlanta and the Atlanta Cyclorama & Civil War Museum. She’s seeking a fourth term on the council. Powell, a self-employed transportation consultant, is one of two candidates running against Smith. The third candidate in the race is Robert Welsh, budget manager for the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities. In 2002, Smith said she was vice chair of the council’s transportation committee. In December of that year, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Council President Cathy Woolard appointed Smith to chair the Committee on Council. ""I'm thrilled and excited,"" the AJC quoted Smith in December 2002. ""I couldn't be more pleased. I'm going to do the best job I can. It will be a fun committee to chair."" Smith held that post for two years, she said. In 2003, Smith was picked to lead a committee that looked into the city’s policy on street name changes, in response to the flurry of paperwork City Hall was receiving to honor civic and political leaders, such as the late Mayor Ivan Allen. In 2006, Smith was chair of the council’s zoning committee. The committee grappled with a temporary ban on some residential construction in four northeast Atlanta neighborhoods. The following year, Smith was chair of the council’s utilities committee, which primarily deals with water and sewer issues. Smith led that committee for three years. Smith was quoted in several AJC articles in her capacity as chairwoman. Clearly, Smith chaired some council committees. So how could Powell’s flier be so off-base? The candidate said he was given inaccurate information from someone at City Hall when he went there to research Smith’s positions. ""I was informed that she did not ever chair or vice chair during her 12 years,"" Powell said in an email. ""I find this most disturbing as it was never my intention to mislead the voters on the facts."" Powell apologized and said he planned to issue a retraction. Smith, who said she had not heard from Powell, said the flier contained several inaccurate claims about herself as well as Welsh. ""He is the candidate,"" she said. ""He should check and double-check all of his information."" Powell could have done more research, such as reading Smith’s biography on the City Council’s website. It has information about committees she has chaired. He admitted the error. This claim, obviously, is False.",/factchecks/2013/oct/11/bill-powell/council-candidate-errs-about-incumbents-resume/

Louie Gohmert linked George Washington and Egyptian general
","In her Oct. 3, 2013, opinion column, Gail Collins of the New York Times referred to U.S. Rep.

Collins wrote that this cast includes Gohmert, who had an ""exciting time"" with Republican Reps. Steve King of Iowa and Michele Bachmann of Minnesota ""in Egypt on a recent fact-finding tour during which ... Gohmert compared the current general-in-charge, Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, to George Washington."" By email, Collins’ research aide, Isabella Moschen, pointed us to a New York Times news article posted online Sept. 8, 2013, describing a Cairo news conference featuring Bachmann, King and Gohmert. The Times story said Gohmert ""compared the leader of the military takeover, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, to George Washington."" The visiting Americans vowed to defend the $1.3 billion in annual American military aid to Egypt, according to the story, so its army could continue its fight against what Gohmert called ""the bloodthirsty Muslim brothers."" ""Stand strong, Egypt,"" Gohmert was quoted as saying. ""Stand firm."" We checked Gohmert’s wording by watching a 15-minute YouTube video of part of the press conference. Here’s the relevant quote by Gohmert from the video: ""George Washington, doing what no one had ever done before him, led a military in revolution, won the revolution and then resigned and went home. No one had ever done that. And we met in Gen. el-Sisi, a man who’s the leader of the military, who might have a shot at being elected president, but who’s more concerned about giving his life to help his country, Egypt."" So, Gohmert did liken el-Sisi’s situation to that of Washington after his Revolutionary War victory. Our ruling Collins said Gohmert compared the current general-in-charge in Egypt to George Washington. Gohmert linked the Egyptian general and Washington. But this statement could benefit from the clarification that Gohmert’s comparison was limited to each figure’s desire to put his country ahead of himself; he did not compare other aspects of their characters or achievements. We rate this claim, which would have benefited from clarification, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Texas congressman mentioned attacks on Christian beliefs and Colorado shootings but did not blame one for the other
","In her Oct. 3, 2013, oped column, Gail Collins of the New York Times referred to U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Tyler as among a couple dozen ""unhinged"" House Republicans keeping the government from being funded unless the Obamacare law is unplugged. Collins wrote that this cast includes Gohmert, ""who blamed the mass shooting at a movie theater in Colorado on ‘the ongoing attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs.’"" By email, Collins’ research aide, Isabella Moschen, said Collins’ reference to Gohmert blaming the Colorado shootings on attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs traced to a CBS News report posted online the day of the shootings July 20, 2012, headlined: ""GOP Rep. links shooting to ‘attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs.’"" The story said that in a radio interview that day, Gohmert had associated the mass shooting with ""attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs."" The story said he made the comment on ""Istook Live!"", a program produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation. Initially, CBS News said, the show’s host, Ernest Istook, asked Gohmert, ""What is your experience with the way that we have too many twisted minds in our society?"" Gohmert responded: ""Some of us happen to believe that when our founders talked about guarding our virtue and freedom, that that was important. Whether it's John Adams saying our Constitution was made only for moral and religious people... Ben Franklin, only a virtuous people are capable of freedom, as nations become corrupt and vicious they have more need of masters... We have been at war with the very pillars, the very foundation of this country."" The congressman then said: ""And... what really gets me as a Christian is to see the ongoing attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs and then some senseless crazy act of a derelict takes place."" A web link in the CBS News story led us to audio of the interview as posted that day by the Huffington Post. According to the recording, after Gohmert’s mention of Judeo-Christian beliefs, the show’s host replied: ""Now in this case, we don’t know much about the individual…"" Gohmert said: ""Don’t misunderstand my statement by saying it’s terror. I’m not saying that at all. It could be anybody. We know that. ...But it is a terror act when you go in and start terrorizing people like this, no matter what your background is."" The host said the attack wouldn’t have to have been by an Islamic terrorist. ""Right,"" Gohmert said, before criticizing attempts he described as keeping God from being invoked at an off-campus school event in Florida. ""I mean, that kind of stuff? Where is God? Well, what have we done with God?"" Gohmert said. ""We’ve told him we don’t want him around. And I kind of like his protective hand being present."" We asked Gohmert about Collins’ claim and didn’t hear back. We noticed, though, that his House office issued a Gohmert statement later July 20, 2012, stating in part: ""This tragedy is not only heartbreaking –it is incomprehensible."" The congressman’s response was accompanied by his transcript of the Istook interview. Gohmert prefaced his statement by saying: ""Some of my comments in this interview have been taken out of context."" Separately, we asked Collins if she had other evidence of Gohmert blaming attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs for the shootings. Moschen replied by email that Collins’ reference to Gohmert laying such blame was a ""fair comment."" Our ruling Collins said Gohmert ""blamed the mass shooting at a movie theater in Colorado on ‘the ongoing attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs.’"" On the day of the shootings, Gohmert aired concern about attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs and referred, in the same breath, to the shootings. He also said later that day that some of his comments were taken out of context. We agree. Gohmert reflected on attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs, but did not blame the shootings on such attacks.

Steve Lonegan claims violent crime is up in Newark; also pans city's unemployment, high school dropout rates
","Violent crime higher now than eight years ago, unemployment well into the double digits, and more than half of Newark’s high schoolers forgoing their education. Are things that bleak in the Brick City? Republican Steve Lonegan, who is challenging Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a Democrat, for a vacant U.S. Senate seat on Oct. 16, addressed those issues during a Sept. 23 interview with radio host John Gambling on WOR 710 AM. ""Violent crime is up since the last year of Sharpe James’ administration,"" Lonegan told Gambling. ""This year it’s higher. … The unemployment rate is almost 15 percent. The high school dropout rate is over 50 percent."" Those statistics offer a troubling view of the city and while there’s some accuracy to the claims, they leave out critical details. Let’s first address violent crime, then go to unemployment and education. Lonegan campaign spokesman Will Gattenby said in an e-mail that the violent crime claim is based on numbers from the FBI’s annual detailed report on crime statistics known as the Uniform Crime Report. Lonegan’s camp compared UCR data from 2005 and 2012. The FBI’s UCR defines violent crime in four categories: murder and nonnegligent homicide; forcible rape; robbery; and aggravated assault. The number of violent crime offenses in Newark last year totaled 3,219. The 2005 total was 2,821. James Allen, Booker’s communications director, said it would be ""a fair benchmark"" to use 2006 to measure violent crime since James, also a Democrat, left office that year and Booker succeeded him on July 1, 2006. The results are the same, though. When compared with 2012 UCR data, overall violent crime is up, as Lonegan claims, but he fails to note that offenses in three categories have fallen: homicides and manslaughters, rapes, and aggravated assaults. Here's a look at Newark's violent crime statistics, according to the data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report: VIOLENT CRIME TOTAL MURDER/NON-NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE Sources: FBI website, Crime In The United States (Uniform Crime Report), 2005, 2006, 2012 Robberies are driving that category's increase, according to Allen, who said the stealing of iPhones and smartphones represents a significant number of those crimes. ""While the rise of smartphones over the last five years has made them increasingly prevalent targets for robberies, the generic UCR classification of ‘violent crime’  gives equal weight to a smartphone robbery and a first-degree murder -- despite the vastly different nature and frequency of those crimes,"" Allen said in an e-mail. Next, unemployment. Newark’s unemployment rate has largely been stuck between 14 percent and 16 percent for much of Booker’s tenure as mayor, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. It’s worth noting, however, that Booker’s tenure also bookends the recession, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. BLS data shows a sharp uptick in the city’s unemployment rate during the recession and after it ended. Comparatively, Newark’s unemployment measured as a percent change is lower than unemployment increases for the state and nation, according to BLS data. Finally, let’s look at Newark’s dropout rate, which Lonegan said exceeds 50 percent. ""The number of students who start 9th grade and graduate within four years via HSPA is 32.2%,"" Gattenby told us. That methodology has been cited by Gov. Chris Christie, who has claimed multiple times that the graduation rate for an incoming Newark freshman who finishes high school in four years is 23 percent. The Truth-O-Meter handed Christie a Pants on Fire for repeating the claim. Like Christie, Lonegan looks only at one group of students -– those who graduate by passing the High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA), a state standardized test. But there are other routes to graduation, including the Alternative High School Assessment. Also, some students are exempt from testing. In total, 55 percent of students graduated from Newark’s high schools in four years, according to data from the 2009-2010 school year, PolitiFact New Jersey determined in January 2012. Jarrad Toussant, Booker’s senior education adviser, told us that the district’s graduation rate for June 2012 was 68 percent. The remaining 32 percent either graduated after more than four years or dropped out, he said. The Newark School District, which Toussant said tracks dropout data, did not respond to our request for comment. Our ruling Lonegan said, ""Violent crime is up since the last year of Sharpe James’ administration. This year it’s higher. … The unemployment rate is almost 15 percent. The high school dropout rate is over 50 percent."" Overall violent crime is up whether measured from 2005 or 2006 to 2012, but the increase is skewed by a sharp uptick in robberies, according to UCR statistics. Violent crime is down in other categories. Unemployment during Booker’s tenure has hovered between 14 percent and 16 percent, but the impact of the recession on those figures can’t be disregarded. Lonegan’s claim about Newark dropouts is based on students who graduate following a standardized testing route, but that doesn’t consider all of the district’s high schoolers. There are other routes to graduation. Each claim has a varying degree of accuracy to it, but each claim also leaves out important details and context. That’s why we rate the overall claim Half True.

GOP says Mary Burke, candidate for governor, has tax-and-spend record as school board member
","The quiet but steady buildup to Democrat Mary Burke’s campaign for governor gave the Wisconsin Republican Party time to pounce. On Oct. 7, 2013, the day Burke announced her candidacy by video, the state GOP launched MaryBurke.com, a site that denigrates the former Trek Bicycle Corp. executive and state commerce secretary as a liberal millionaire and a killer of jobs. The party also uses the site to attack Burke’s tenure on the Madison School Board, declaring: ""Mary Burke is simply more of the same – as she has proven on the Madison Board of Education. (She) voted to increase taxes by the maximum amount under state law by voting to approve the 2012-’13 Madison (Metropolitan) School District final budget on Oct. 29, 2012. Rather than work to make government more efficient, she voted to raise taxes and increase spending. She would do the same as governor – and we’ve come too far to go backward now."" We can’t predict, of course, what Burke would do if she is elected governor in November 2014. But we can check her taxing and spending record -- scant, though it may be -- since she was elected to the Madison School Board in April 2012. Three votes Burke has taken part in three school board votes on two budgets for the Madison Metropolitan School District. In Madison, property taxes make up about 60 percent of the school district’s funding. The school board has relatively little control over the rest of its revenue, which comes from the state, the federal government and local sources such as student fees. (Statewide, as of 2011-’12, school districts got an average of 43 percent of their revenue from property taxes, although the range was 14 percent to 93 percent, according to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.) To back its claim against Burke, the Republican Party cited not only property tax levies but total budget figures, so we’ll examine both. 1. Preliminary 2012-’13 budget Burke joined the majority on the school board in a 6-1 vote on June 18, 2012, to approve the school district’s preliminary budget for 2012-’13. It would have raised the property tax levy by 4.95 percent. The school district’s portion of the property tax bill for the average Madison home, valued at $232,000, would have increased $91. 2. Final 2012-’13 budget Burke joined in a 7-0 vote on Oct. 29, 2012, that gave final approval to the 2012-’13 budget. It included a smaller levy increase than the preliminary budget -- 1.75 percent. That meant an $8 increase on the property tax bill for the average Madison home. The size of the total budget, taking into account all sources of revenue, rose by 4.3 percent. So, for her first annual budget, Burke voted twice in favor of raising property taxes and the size of the total school district budget. 3. Preliminary 2013-’14 budget On Aug. 26, 2013, the school board voted 6-1 to to approve a preliminary budget for 2013-’14. A final vote is scheduled for Oct. 28, 2013. Burke was the lone dissenter. The property tax levy would increase nearly 4.5 percent, boosting the property tax bill by $119 on a typical Madison home. Despite her no vote, Burke indicated she was open to a property tax increase. Several weeks before the preliminary vote, she told The Capital Times regarding property taxes: ""I think in an environment where we’ve seen real wages in Dane County decrease, and a lot of people are on fixed incomes, we have to work as hard as possible to limit any increase to the inflation rate."" As for the total budget, it would actually decrease, by less than half of a percentage point; but, again, Burke voted no. So, for her second budget, Burke expressed being open to a relatively small property tax hike, but voted against a preliminary plan that would carry a larger levy increase but a smaller total budget. Our rating The Wisconsin Republican Party said Burke ""has proven on the Madison Board of Education"" that she supports raising taxes and spending. Burke voted for a larger total budget, which included a property tax increase, for 2012-’13. In a preliminary vote for 2013-’14, she opposed a property tax increase that was larger than she advocated; that was part of a proposal that actually reduces the size of the total budget. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give the state GOP a Half True.

Was C.W. Bill Young ever the only Republican in the Florida Senate?
","U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young announced he will not seek re-election in 2014, setting off tributes from Florida politicos to the Pinellas County Republican’s 53-year career in public office. One tweet about Young’s early years caught our eye. ""Many don’t know that Bill Young was once the minority leader in the Florida Senate,"" tweeted Chris Latvala, a Republican running for the Florida House and son of Sen. Jack Latvala, ""because he was the only Republican senator."" It’s an interesting claim, if for no other reason than the Senate for the past decade has been dominated by Republicans. We did not have to go far to confirm Latvala’s tweet. All it took was a trip to the Tampa Bay Times library, which keeps records on local candidates and officials and state handbooks from way back in the day. Young identified himself as the minority leader of the Florida Senate in an undated questionnaire that includes this key line: ""In 1960, at age 29, elected as the youngest Senator and the only Republican Senator in Florida."" Young was elected to the Democrat-controlled Senate in 1960 and was the sole Republican member. He was re-elected in subsequent years, serving through 1970 when he won his first congressional election. Senate records from the time don’t list party affiliation -- a sign of how powerful Democrats were -- but we confirmed the party affiliation of senators by combing through the State Library and Archives of Florida. It’s also not clear Young had the official title of minority leader -- the records we found were silent on the point -- but as the only GOP senator until 1963, he offered the lone voice of party dissent. Young’s 1960 election to the Senate set into motion a GOP resurgence in that chamber, said Curt Kiser, a lawyer-lobbyist who represented Pinellas County in the state House in 1972 and the Senate in 1984. ""He was the minority leader because he was the only one,"" Kiser said. ""That was the beginning of the modern history of the Republican Party."" Young gained more GOP company as the ‘60s rolled on, starting with Warren Henderson of Venice in 1963. By 1967, 20 Republicans served in the Senate. (The Senate back then had 48 members; today it has 40.) The increase reflected Florida’s evolving demographics, with conservative Democrats in the northern part of the state switching parties and new residents moving from conservative states casting votes for GOP candidates and running for office themselves. Democrats remained in control of the Senate until Republicans took over in 1994. Latvala’s tweet is accurate. We rate it True.",/factchecks/2013/oct/09/chris-latvala/did-cw-bill-young-serve-only-republican-florida-se/

Can 6 to 20 bicycles fit into a single car-parking space?
","U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer has been associated with many causes during his 17 years in Congress. Bow ties come to mind, as does his support for protecting public lands. As founder and co-chair of the Congressional Bicycle Caucus, Blumenauer has been a leading voice in trying to establish the bicycle as a viable form of urban transportation. On the ""Bike and Pedestrian Issues"" page of his official website, he says that cycling improves health, is good for the environment and reduces transportation costs. One assertion in particular jumps out. It says, ""Between 6 and 20 bicycles can be parked in the space required by one car."" PolitiFact Oregon wondered whether that’s true. At first glance, the notion of up to 20 bicycles jammed into a single parking space seems a little much. To get an explanation, we called Blumenauer’s Washington, D.C., office and talked with spokesman Patrick Malone. Malone said the figure came from a paper published in 2011 by researcher Thomas Gotschi. ""Costs and Benefits of Bicycling Investments in Portland, Oregon"" was published in the Journal of Physical Activity & Health. A close reading does not reveal statistics addressing how many bicycles fit into a parking space. One section includes a sentence reading, ""The millions of miles traveled by bike reduce road and parking capacity demand, which is much more costly to provide for cars than for bikes."" It’s followed by a footnote, which took us to a second study, published this summer by the Victoria (B.C.) Transport Policy Institute. That 59-page study, written by Todd Litman, states, ""10-20 bicycles can typically be stored in the space required for one automobile."" Malone also referred to the bike corrals scattered around downtown Portland that hold 12 bicycles each, all in the amount of room needed to park a car. Then, noting two-tiered indoor bike parking available at Portland State University, he added, ""If you took the bike corrals we have now and put in double-decker parking with locks and lift assists, you could double that."" Scott Cohen, the Portland Bureau of Transportation’s  transportation demand management specialist, said Portland has 99 bike corrals. The portion that holds bicycles is 17 feet long and accommodates up to 12 bikes. A standard marked car-parking space is 20 feet long and about 10 feet wide. None of the corrals is the two-tier type mentioned by Malone. So 12 is the highest number of bicycle anyone will see in an area the size of a parking space. Two-tiered bike racks are available online but are primarily designed for commercial storage and retail bike storage and display. Several commercial racks hold as many as 20 bikes in 20 feet, but they need to be mounted to a wall or ceiling and aren’t really designed for outdoor use. Portland-based Alta Planning & Design, which has rolled out its Bicycle Share program in eight cities in the U.S. and abroad, says its racks fit about 10 bicycles in the length of a parking space. What if people simply stood their bikes next to one another or heaped them in a pile? Could 20 bikes fit inside a parking space then? Probably, but those options seem highly unlikely in the United States, and Malone didn’t mention them. Twelve bicycles can be locked safely in downtown Portland bike corrals, but 20 stretches the limits of anything in use -- in Portland and nationwide. The Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center says streetside bike corrals should accommodate 10 to 12 bikes. The Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle Professionals recommends spacing so that no more than 12 fit into a parking spot. As for the mechanical lifts available at PSU: Those won’t be showing on city streets anytime soon. City policies allow only one-tier corrals, and businesses that already pay the city $2,600 to install one seem unlikely to want to pony up more. Blumenauer’s office does cite a study with a footnote leading to another study that says 10 to 20 bikes can fit into a single parking spot. The congressman’s website also gives a range of 6 to 20 bikes, while 12 can commonly fit in corrals. So we find his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2013/oct/09/earl-blumenauer/can-6-20-bicycles-fit-single-car-parking-space/

Dan Patrick isn't alone among candidates to oppose in-state tuition for illegal immigrants
","Dan Patrick wasn’t an elected official when lawmakers and Gov. Rick Perry agreed to authorize in-state college tuition for certain children of illegal immigrants living in Texas. Now, the Houston state senator says in a campaign ad that he is ""the only candidate for lieutenant governor to oppose in-state tuition for illegal immigrants."" Patrick is among Texans jockeying for the GOP nomination to fill the post overseeing the Senate. The others are third-term incumbent David Dewhurst, state Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson and state Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples. In 2001, when the law came to be, neither Patrick, Dewhurst or Patterson had direct says on it. Dewhurst was then the state land commissioner and Patterson was a former state senator. Staples was an East Texas senator and among the vast majority of legislators who voted for House Bill 1403, which became the law that lets undocumented students who have graduated from a Texas high school and lived in Texas for at least three years qualify for in-state tuition — if they sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they're able to do so. Through August 2011, 38,656 non-U.S. citizens and permanent residents had attended Texas colleges or universities at in-state tuition rates, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. And as we noted in a 2011 article, only five of 181 Texas House and Senate members voted against the legislation. The Texas House passed the measure 142-1 before the Senate approved an amended version by 27-3, with Republicans Mike Jackson of La Porte, Jane Nelson of Flower Mound and Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio in opposition. Staples was among a dozen Republicans voting ""aye,"" according to the Senate Journal entry for that day. The House went along with the Senate version with Rep. Jerry Madden, R-Richardson, pushing the legislation’s total tally of ""no"" votes to five. In 2011, Sen. Brian Birdwell, R-Granbury, filed a proposal to repeal the tuition law, but it never made it past the four Republicans and three Democrats who comprised the Senate Higher Education Committee, the Austin American-Statesman said in a Sept. 28, 2011, news article. Birdwell then offered an amendment on the Senate floor that was intended to keep illegal immigrants from qualifying to pay in-state tuition. A document posted online by Patrick’s campaign on behalf of his ad notes that Patrick was among four Republican co-authors of that amendment. According to the Senate Journal showing that May 9, 2011, action, Birdwell withdrew the amendment without the Senate voting on it. According to the Senate’s video of Birdwell’s presentation of his floor amendment, Patrick did not speak during the 30-minute floor discussion; seven other senators asked questions or made statements. Legislative records also indicate that Patrick filed his own repeal proposal in the 2009 regular session; it did not get a hearing. So, is Patrick the only one among the four candidates ""to oppose"" in-state tuition for illegal immigrants? He’s not the only one who opposes it. Staples has said he favors repealing the law. Dewhurst has said that if had been governor in 2001, he would not have signed it into law. And Patterson has said he opposes the benefit, stressing that the issue of legal residency status should be dealt with first. By email, Staples’ campaign spokesman Kent Sholars provided a statement from Staples saying: ""I oppose giving benefits to those who have violated our nation’s entry laws. If that bill came up for a vote today, it would not pass, and I support its repeal."" Sholars also provided a video excerpt of Staples referring to the 2001 legislation during an Oct. 3, 2013, candidate forum in Houston. Staples, who left the Senate in early 2007, said that the measure ""that created in-state tuition was predicated on the assumption that those students would correct their status. That has not been enforced. And it should be repealed."" Good reminder. In 2010, we reported that neither the Texas Education Agency, the coordinating board or the University of Texas at Austin was checking on whether students had applied for permanent residency as they were promising to do in the required affidavits. Institutional officials told us that no law required such follow-ups. By email, board staff spokesman Dominic Chavez recently told us that state law remains silent on designating an agency to check on students seeking legal residency, but the board now has rules requiring affected colleges and universities to retain student affidavits indefinitely or until a student documents compliance. Also, Chavez said, the board has instituted a policy requiring institutions to annually counsel students about their responsibilities in accord with the affidavits. The document from Patrick’s campaign points out that Dewhurst made his opposition to the law clear in 2011--which was at a time Perry was getting pummeled in GOP presidential debates for standing behind the law. Dewhurst said in a September 2011 interview with WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas: ""If we're not going to give fellow Americans who live in Louisiana or Oklahoma or New Mexico the ability to come into Texas and have in-state tuition and save, then is it fair to give that break to people who are not citizens here? So, I would not have signed that law."" Dewhurst did not say in that interview whether the law should be repealed, according to a Sept. 26, 2011, Dallas Morning News news article. By email, Dewhurst campaign spokesman Travis Considine told us Dewhurst has always opposed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. News stories we found using the Nexis service show no signs that Dewhurst tried to repeal it. A Sept. 27, 2011, Associated Press news story said that at the time, Dewhurst's political rivals, including Ted Cruz, who was then scrambling to overtake the better-known Dewhurst for the 2012 Republican U.S. Senate nomination, ""blamed him for not doing more to repeal the law as leader of the Texas Senate."" The AP story quoted Matt Hirsch, spokesman for Dewhurst’s Senate campaign, as defending Dewhurst’s legislative record. ""The overwhelming majority of the Senate favored the in-state tuition benefit,"" Hirsch said, and Perry ""has been firm in his support of the law. In light of Gov. Perry's veto pen, it was clear that any attempt to repeal this benefit would not be signed into law."" Earlier, a May 10, 2007, Fort Worth Star-Telegram news story quoted Dewhurst as saying that if a House proposal to repeal the 2001 law had reached the Senate, its chances of passage would have been slim. ""We'd take a look at it, but historically the Senate has been in favor of providing in-state tuition for everyone living here,"" Dewhurst said then. The September 2011 American-Statesman news article recapping Dewhurst’s statement that he would not have signed the 2001 legislation into law also noted that Dewhurst and state lawmakers had shown little appetite for repealing it. The story said ""there is little evidence to suggest"" that Dewhurst had tried to repeal the law since becoming lieutenant governor in 2003. ""In fact,"" the story said, ""a 2005 piece of legislation clarifying the policy passed the Senate with a 29-0 vote. (The lieutenant governor does not vote.)"" In a June 20, 2012, news story, the Texas Tribune said: ""Dewhurst has said he opposes it but never pushed for the Legislature to repeal it because the votes weren't there."" Regarding Patterson, Patrick’s camp asserted that in a February 2013 interview with the El Paso Times, Patterson said both that he did not support in-state tuition ""for illegals"" and that he supports the idea of ""fixing"" the legal residency status of undocumented immigrants attending Texas colleges and universities. In a telephone interview, Patterson said he was trying to stress the importance of federal immigration reform. After the Times asked Patterson his position on the tuition law, he replied: ""I don't support the idea of saying, ‘We're going to ignore the law and let you do that.’ I support the idea of fixing their status as opposed to trying to just sweep the status under the rug. I would not support an in-state tuition bill for illegals. I would support a method of providing them a lawful status where in-state tuition for illegals wouldn't be a problem. We're Band-Aiding."" Patterson told us federal immigration reform would presumably resolve the legal status of many residents. He also said the Texas law should be repealed. On Patterson’s campaign website, Patterson listed 10 positions he has on immigration, followed by No. 11: ""Unlike others in this race, I didn’t vote for and I would have never voted for or supported in-state tuition for illegal aliens."" Patterson’s campaign manager, Chris Elam, told us by telephone that No. 11 was added after the candidates sparred Oct. 3 in Houston. We told Patrick’s campaign manager, Logan Spence, that Patrick doesn’t appear to be alone among the candidates in opposing the law. Whoa, Spence basically replied, stressing in an email that Staples voted for the measure making the law, Dewhurst failed to let repeal measures clear the Senate and Patterson’s reply to the Times suggests he wants a ""sanctuary"" state. In contrast, Spence said, Patrick proposed a repeal measure and co-authored the Birdwell amendment. ""You don't see a distinction?"" Spence wrote. Our ruling Patrick said he’s ""the only candidate for lieutenant governor to oppose in-state tuition for illegal immigrants."" He is the one candidate who has filed specific proposals to repeal the law. But each of the Republican candidates was public about opposing the law before Patrick debuted his ad while it leaves the impression that other candidates favor the law or have taken no position on it. That’s just not so. We rate Patrick’s statement as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Tom Cotton says Mark Pryor voted to give Congress a special subsidy for health care
","Republicans have high hopes that they will topple Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas in 2014. The campaign of U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., poses a real threat in a state that has gone Republican by ever wider margins in the last four presidential elections. In 2012, President Barack Obama got just 37 percent of the vote. Cotton’s ads aim to tie Pryor to Obama, and the latest one titled ""Good for the Gander"" focuses on Obamacare. The tone is jaunty with geese popping up on the screen, but the message is sharp. Here’s the text: What’s good for the goose ought to be good for the gander. But not in Washington. Mark Pryor cast the deciding vote to make you live under Obamacare. But Pryor votes himself and everyone in Congress special subsidies so they’re protected from Obamacare. Exceptions and special subsidies for Mark Pryor. Higher insurance premiums for you. Mark Pryor. Voting with Obama. Voting against Arkansans. Like you. The charge that this or that Democrat cast the deciding vote for the Affordable Care Act has shown up before. In June, a conservative group leveled it at Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla, (PolitiFact Florida rated that Mostly False), and in 2012, a Republican challenger made the same claim about Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio (PolitiFact Ohio rated that False). The reality is that if any Democratic senator deserves the distinction of clearing the way for the health reform law, it is Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska. As was widely reported at the time, Nelson delivered the 60th vote needed to send the bill to the floor for a vote. We spoke with Cotton’s staff and they didn’t actually say that Pryor played a unique role. They hold Pryor accountable because, ""All of the votes were critical."" But Pryor’s support for the Affordable Care Act was known well before the final vote. However, in this fact check, we wanted to look at the weightier claim that Pryor voted to give everyone in Congress a special subsidy to protect them from Obamacare. Not so special The ""special subsidy"" has its roots in a wrinkle in the Affordable Care Act. The law has a provision, pushed by Republicans, that requires members of Congress and their staff to buy health coverage through the government marketplaces that opened for business on Oct. 1. This clause treats lawmakers and congressional workers unlike any other workers in the country. At least three-quarters of Americans get insurance through their jobs, with employers paying part of the insurance premium. For the most part, Obamacare doesn’t touch that relationship. The clear exception is lawmakers and congressional workers. They must drop their current coverage and find something equivalent from insurance companies participating in the Marketplaces. But within the marketplaces, there is no explicit provision for the federal government to continue to pay the share of the premiums that it had before. The full cost would fall on the congressional workers with a price tag of thousands of dollars for each person. Even the National Review, the conservative magazine that is none too fond of Obamacare, recently wrote that the provision treats lawmakers and staff ""particularly badly...People who happen to be paid by the federal treasury don’t deserve to have the entire value of their existing coverage stripped away, as almost no Americans will experience."" As a fix, the Office of Personnel Management, the agency in charge of federal worker benefits, ruled that it would take the same money that it would have spent on the government’s old health insurance and spend it on whatever lawmakers and their staffs purchased on the Obamacare marketplaces. In other words, it would do what every other employer does. Continuing that cost-sharing is the ""special subsidy"" the Cotton ad refers to. What Pryor voted for Republicans in the House and Senate proposed language that would block the federal government from splitting the cost of the premiums with congressional workers.The measure passed in the House but died in the Senate on Sept. 30 on a straight party-line vote. Pryor voted with all the other Democrats to table the House legislation. Cotton’s office told us that by blocking the Republican measure, Pryor was allowing Congress to do something that other employers can’t do until 2017. They cited a provision in Obamacare. ""Sec. 1312 (f)(2)(B)(i) specifically prohibits large businesses from doing so until 2017 and does not provide an exception for anyone to do so before that date,"" Cotton’s staff said. ""Following OPM's ruling, only members of Congress and their staff can receive an employer contribution from a large business on the small business exchange in 2014."" That interpretation is questionable. The law says, ""Beginning in 2017, each state may allow issuers of health insurance coverage in the large group market in the State to offer qualified health plans in such market through an exchange."" Timothy Jost, professor of law at Washington and Lee School of Law and a national expert on the text of the health care law, said Cotton’s office misreads the law. ""The provision doesn’t say large employers can't contribute,"" Jost said. ""It says large group insurance through the exchange won’t be offered to them."" Another specialist in health care law, Mark Hall at the Wake Forest University School of Law, is equally emphatic. ""This provision does not prevent the Office of Personnel Management or the federal government contributing to government worker’s premiums on the exchange prior to 2017,"" Hall said. ""And doing so does not give them a special exception beyond what the ACA allows."" Jost said in one place, the Affordable Care Act tells Congress to offer members of Congress and staffers insurance through the marketplace, and in another, it blocks states from offering large group insurance plans through the marketplaces for several years. ""The two are completely unrelated,"" Jost said. Our ruling Cotton said Pryor voted for ""special subsidies"" for lawmakers and staff in congress ""so they’re protected from Obamacare."" The subsidy referred to is the government continuing to share the cost of insurance premiums as is standard practice in every establishment that offers insurance to its workers. There is nothing special about that. The only thing special about Obamacare and Congress is that the law treated Congress and its workers differently than any other group of workers. Cotton relies on an interpretation of the law that independent experts say is wrong. The assertion falls wide of the facts, and we rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2013/oct/09/tom-cotton/cotton-says-pryor-voted-give-congress-special-subs/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Technology', 'Tom Cotton']","
The health care marketplaces have 'no privacy protections,' Cotton says
","When it comes to Web design, everyone’s a critic. The Affordable Care Act’s new online marketplaces certainly aren’t an exception. But some Internet complaints directed in President Barack Obama’s general direction go beyond cosmetics, attacking security, too. Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who opposes Obamacare, was particularly vocal on MSNBC about the issues he saw with the new system. He said lawmakers now realize some of the downfalls of the system, including technical concerns. ""They realize that the websites aren't ready, that there's no privacy protections, that there's likely to be data breaches,"" he said. Now, it’s clear that there are lots of bugs in the online marketplaces where consumers browse and purchase health care plans. There have been reported issues with the live chat function, registration process and speed of service, among other things. It’s not even clear how many people have been able to buy insurance, but it doesn’t seem like very many. Cotton, though, said that the websites have no privacy protections and are therefore likely to be hacked. We decided to look into it to determine just how vulnerable consumer information is. Where does your personal data go? As users navigate healthcare.gov, they get pointed toward the marketplace websites appropriate for their specific states. To apply for health insurance, they have to submit some sensitive information, including a Social Security number and last year’s income. The site itself routs responses through a data hub, so that the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration can verify customers’ identities and confirm eligibility for subsidies to buy health insurance. This information isn’t stored in the hub itself, though, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the online marketplaces. So information isn’t sitting there waiting to be stolen. There are baseline privacy standards for the marketplaces that come directly from the health care reform legislation itself and previous health privacy laws. All the information collected must be relevant to determining eligibility and enrollment, said Christopher Rasmussen, a Health Privacy Project analyst at the Center for Democracy & Technology. The information is submitted through secure protocols that government websites have long followed, said George Smith, an expert in the technology and science of cybersecurity. The U.S. Department of Commerce developed a cybersecurity framework (that we would link to, if not for the government shutdown) that includes guidelines and best practices for organizations to secure their IT systems, designed to complement risk management already in place. Scott Borg, CEO of the U.S. Cyber Consequences unit, a nonprofit institute that researches the economic consequences of possible cyber attacks, said the marketplaces are more secure than most popular e-commerce sites because they’re less complicated. ""We can expect the health insurance industry websites after the Affordable Care Act is fully operating to be simpler, less numerous, and more like each other,"" Borg said.  ""This will make them easier to secure and, in general, should improve their cyber security."" Potential data breaches When we asked Cotton’s office about his statement, his staff pointed us to an August report indicating that government agencies pushed back some early security testing deadlines. This is true, but CMS reported later that the security testing was completed in September. That includes security testing done by an independent organization. The final security authorization for the marketplace websites were completed on Sept. 6, two days behind the original timeline and several weeks before the marketplaces opened in October. We also looked at an incident of a state website leaking personal data that a spokeswoman from Cotton’s office referred us to. MNsure, the Minnesota marketplace, accidentally emailed a spreadsheet identifying 2,400 insurance agents to an insurance broker’s office. But that didn’t involve consumer data, and it happened prior to the opening of the MNsure marketplace on Oct. 1. Also, MNsure reported that this was due to human error, not an IT glitch. Can the marketplace websites be hacked? Data isn’t lying around for federal employees to take, but we also wanted to see how easy it might be for hackers to access.  ""In general, it is very difficult to assess whether any website has adequate data security without conducting an internal security audit or attempting an attack from the outside,"" said Anton Dahbura, the executive director of the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute. However, we found no evidence that the healthcare.gov webpages are any more vulnerable to to attack than other websites associated wtih traditional e-commerce. ""These are actually going to be more secure than most government sites need to be,"" Borg said. Our ruling Cotton claimed that there are no privacy protections in the new online health care marketplaces. However, we found federal privacy regulations in the Affordable Care Act that keep the system’s data hub from storing user data. The cybersecurity experts we spoke with said that the security precautions in place on healthcare.gov are at least as strong as secure e-commerce websites consumers are already accustomed to using. No one we spoke with raised concerns about privacy. The most relevant complaints we saw remain that the websites are slow, not that consumer information is vulnerable. We rate Cotton’s statement False.",/factchecks/2013/oct/09/tom-cotton/aca-marketplaces-have-no-privacy-protections-cotto/
"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Mary Burke']","
Mary Burke says Wisconsin had 84,000 more jobs when she was Commerce secretary
","Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s bashing of his predecessor’s record on job creation was on Mary Burke’s mind when the Madison Democrat officially announced her 2014 gubernatorial candidacy. Unsurprisingly, Burke was not content to let Walker tag her as responsible for the 133,000 jobs lost during Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle’s second term. The former Trek Bicycle executive was Doyle’s commerce chief from February 2005 to November 2007, overlapping Doyle’s two terms. In her announcement, Burke pointed to where Wisconsin stood at the end of her Commerce tenure compared to where it stands now, after two years with Walker at the helm. ""After Trek, I spent a few years as Wisconsin’s Commerce secretary, focused every day on creating jobs,"" Burke said in a video on Oct. 7, 2013. ""We reopened the mill in Park Falls, brought Uline to Kenosha and helped entrepreneurs and new businesses start up and grow."" She concluded: ""All in all it meant 84,000 more Wisconsin jobs than we have today."" Burke brought up the number to claim that politicians in Madison (she didn’t name Walker) are more hung up on arguing than solving problems. As she begins a campaign that no doubt will focus on Walker’s promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs, let’s examine her 84,000-job claim. To check state employment figures, we’ll use the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, a thorough jobs count used by economists and state and federal jobs officials. The figures are gathered by the state, then adjusted and published by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. A technical note: Because the quarterly jobs data is not seasonally adjusted, it’s not useful to compare the jobs picture for Burke’s last month (October 2007) to the latest-reported Walker month (March 2013). But we can look at three different apples-to-apples measurements. --The annual averages for 2007 (Burke’s last year) and 2012 (the most recent full year under Walker) show Wisconsin’s total employment was 85,520 persons higher in 2007 than in 2012. Note: Burke used total public and private employment, while Walker’s pledge is for private-sector jobs, but that distinction made little difference in this instance, we found. -- Comparing December 2007 to December 2012, the gap is 81,912. -- The gap when comparing October 2007 (Burke’s last month) to the same month in 2012 is 79,436. So Burke’s 84,000 figure fits in that range. How is it possible that 133,000 jobs were lost in Doyle’s last term, but the total employment figure in 2012 under Walker is lower than the 2007 figure cited by Burke? The answer lies in what happened in the last three years of Doyle’s term, which essentially ended in December 2010. Until mid-2008, monthly employment in Wisconsin was rising, as it had for years. In June 2008, seven months after Burke departed, the total employment count started a big slide that was part of the Great Recession that swept the United States. The slide ended in mid-2010 in Doyle’s final year, and the monthly gains that started then have generally continued under Walker. Who gets the credit? Part of Burke’s claim is that her actions as Commerce secretary and those of the Doyle administration explain why employment was higher then than now. Burke highlighted two major instances when her agency provided state help in adding jobs. The paper mill in Park Falls she mentioned, Flambeau River, reopened in 2006 with millions in aid from Burke’s Commerce Department under Doyle. It had closed earlier in the year, a victim of the digital era that has meant hard times in the printing business, the Journal Sentinel reported. Historical note: As the Journal Sentinel reported, the loans to Flambeau River were the largest among more than $12 million in loans to state businesses that Walker’s new jobs agency failed to track systematically, forcing major changes at the agency. The other firm Burke mentioned, Uline Inc., was offered millions in incentives and aid from Wisconsin to move its headquarters from northern Illinois and build a major new distribution center in Pleasant Prairie. There were other factors, though, behind both success stories. The paper mill was rescued by a local buyer with high financial incentive to rescue the plant. At Uline, a company official said at the time that Wisconsin got the nod because it had a ""huge shovel-ready site"" that was close to an expressway and to Uline's existing Waukegan headquarters. Burke campaign aide Joe Zepecki told us that Burke deserves credit for economic success because her job was to focus on creating jobs. As we’ve noted in past items, though, a chief executive such as a governor has influence over jobs, but so do a host of other factors, such as national trends, that are beyond a governor’s control, much less a Commerce secretary’s. ""The economy is a big thing and it is ridiculous for one person to take sole credit, or to be assigned sole blame, for anything that happens,"" Brian Jacobsen, an economist at Wells Fargo Bank and lecturer at Wisconsin Lutheran College, told us. ""They can help or hurt matters, but we should really evaluate the merits of the policies they propose to implement."" Looking at the numbers, Wisconsin’s private-sector grew more slowly than the nation’s under Doyle before the recession, including in the 2005-2007 period Burke refers to, the Journal Sentinel reported. So that further limits how much credit Burke can claim. Similarly, the 2012 jobs total under Walker was necessarily affected by the same recession that dragged job growth well into negative numbers in Doyle’s last term. Subsequent growth under Doyle in 2010 beat the U.S. average, while the growth rate has lagged that mark under Walker. Finally, we note that in 2007, shortly before announcing she would resign, Burke issued a harsh criticism of her agency. She said the Commerce Department, which ought to be among the state’s most influential economic players, has sat on the sidelines while other states vie to recruit new businesses. ""We are not out there selling the state and attracting the companies,"" Burke said in 2007. Our rating Burke said her years as Wisconsin commerce secretary meant the state brought ""84,000 more Wisconsin jobs than we have today."" The numerical part of the claim is on target -- Burke’s tenure was pre-recession and despite gains Wisconsin has not yet rebounded to 2007 levels. But Burke overstates the credit that she and Doyle deserve for the 2007 figure, and skips past the recession that helps explain the statistical truth. We rate her claim Half True.

Deal's rival says 'bed tax' renewal flawed
","Dalton Mayor David Pennington is one of the well-known candidates challenging incumbent Nathan Deal for governor. Pennington, along with fellow GOP challenger and State School Superintendent John Barge, have been traveling the state getting out their campaign messages. For Pennington, that message is limited government and limited spending. During one recent campaign stop in the city of Carrollton, before the Carroll County Tea Party, Pennington sought to distinguish himself from Deal by noting some of what he perceived as the governor’s missteps. One example was the extension of the hospital bed tax, legislation pushed by Deal and approved by the General Assembly earlier this year. By shifting the fee collection to an unelected health board, lawmakers subverted the law that governs how tax bills are passed, Pennington said. ""This is clearly unconstitutional,"" Pennington said during the meeting, which was reported by the Times-Georgian. ""Any tax law has to start in the House and this one was started in the Senate."" Was this levy extension a violation of the law and we missed it? We wanted to determine whether Pennington was correct in his assessment, so we did some research. We asked Pennington about his source for the claim. The mayor said he relied on an article by longtime Capitol reporter Tom Crawford and confirmation of his claims by several legislators who also criticized the bill and process for getting it passed. ""The constitution is clear that any tax has to come from the Legislature, but they passed that (responsibility) on to another department,"" Pennington told us. Since 2010, hospitals have paid a Medicaid provider fee, a 1.45 percent tax on their total patient revenue, which was used to attract federal matching funds for Medicaid. The fee, also known as a ""bed tax,"" was set to expire June 30. The ""bed tax"" had traditionally been imposed by the General Assembly. The measure passed this year, which began as a Senate bill, would transfer that duty to the board of the Department of Community Health, and extend the fee another four years. Critics said it was an end run to keep lawmakers from having to vote on what they deemed a tax measure. Tracking the bill’s history through the Georgia General Assembly records shows that the legislation did begin in the Senate, where it was introduced on Jan. 14, the first day of the session. Two days later, a Senate committee approved the bill, and the following day, the full chamber passed the bill. It was signed into law a month later. Some lawmakers questioned the constitutionality of the Senate’s actions. By starting the bill in the Senate instead of in the House, ""you’re inviting a lawsuit where it can be overturned,"" Senate Minority Leader Steve Henson, D-Tucker, said at the time. Georgia law requires that ""all bills for raising revenue, or appropriating money, shall originate in the House of Representatives."" But because the fee would be collected by a board and not by state tax collectors, supporters said the measure did not have to follow the procedure required for tax bills. And why didn’t the criticism get more publicity? Because the lawmakers who were the critics were Democrats, the minority in the Legislature, so they really didn’t have a say in the matter, reporter Tom Crawford told us. Also, the General Assembly’s lawyers said the path through the Senate was acceptable. ""From a strict legal perspective the bill does not require that the (community health) department impose any fee but rather gives the department complete discretion as to whether or not to assess a fee,"" said the Legislative Counsel opinion, issued Jan. 13. ""... because the bill only authorizes the imposition of a fee, but does not actually impose a fee, the bill would not be considered a revenue bill"" and would not have to originate in the House. Thus far, there have been no challenges to the bills, Henson said. And a favorable ruling in the matter would be difficult based on state law. In other court challenges, the Georgia Supreme Court has held that if an act has been passed by both houses of the Legislature, signed by the governor and recorded, the court has determined that the act was passed in a constitutional manner. So is Pennington correct in his assessment of the hospital ""bed tax"" extension passed during the most recent legislative session? Pennington said the hospital ""bed tax"" extension bill was a tax bill and should have started in the House, instead of the Senate as it did. The mayor and gubernatorial candidate is correct that tax laws must begin in the House of Representatives. But because the bill called for a state agency -- and not lawmakers -- to levy the fee, a legislative law opinion deemed the approval process acceptable. Also, challenges to the bill’s constitutionality would be difficult because the Georgia Supreme Court has not overturned legislation that has been duly passed by both houses and signed into law. Pennington and others may not agree with the process, or how the hospital levy is classified, but the law appears not to be on their side. We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/oct/09/david-pennington/deals-rival-says-bed-tax-renewal-flawed/

Rep. Dennis Ross says U.S. spending has fallen two straight years for first time since Korean War
","U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Lakeland, is one of a small group of Republicans calling for an end to the government shutdown. After all, Republicans have succeeded in reining in government spending, Ross wrote in an op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times (the parent of PolitiFact), on Oct. 7, 2013. ""In the few years since I was elected to Congress in 2010, we have achieved huge savings and taken monumental steps. For the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row,"" Ross wrote, adding, ""That is why I would support a continuing resolution that funds the government at sequestration levels for one year."" A reader asked us whether Ross was correct that, ""for the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row."" We thought the claim was interesting, and we decided to check it out. By the most basic measure we found that Ross is right. The Korean War was an active conflict through the signing of a truce on July 26, 1953, so we counted starting in 1953. Between 1953 and 1955, federal spending fell each year, from $76.1 billion to $70.9 billion to $68.4 billion, according to the Office of Management and Budget. By 1956, spending had edged up again, to $70.6 billion. After that, spending almost always went up every year, at least until recently. It fell for one year between 1964 and 1965, and then once again between 2009 and 2010. But the only time it fell two years in a row was between 2011 and 2013. In 2011, federal outlays were $3.60 trillion. Outlays fell to $3.54 trillion in 2012, and the Congressional Budget Office projects the figure to fall to $3.46 trillion in 2013. We should note that this is not the only way to measure a claim like this. Sometimes, raw dollars aren’t an especially useful measurement for analyzing long periods of history, especially when talking about things that are growing. Inflation, population growth and economic expansion almost inevitably make the most recent year the largest ever. However, in this case, we think that using raw dollars is an acceptable measurement. That’s because reductions in spending mean swimming against the tide of inflation and growth. Our rating Ross said that, ""for the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row."" Since the 1950s, spending fell one year between 1964 and 1965, and then once again between 2009 and 2010. But the only time it fell two years in a row was between 2011 and 2013.

Attorney in same-sex marriage case says ‘very few men outlive their own fertility’
","
Kids are at the center of marriage, argue supporters of California’s same-sex marriage ban. 
But infertile opposite-sex couples can get married, opponents point out — so why not same-sex pairs? 
Men stay fertile till their deathbeds, said an attorney arguing against rights for same-sex couples. 
Confused? 
Consider the actual debate before the Supreme Court on March 26, 2013, in Hollingsworth vs. Perry. 
Justice Elena Kagan compared a ban on marriage licenses for couples over age 55 with a ban on marriage licenses for same-sex couples. Couples over 55 are unlikely to produce children, she pointed out. Yet it would be unconstitutional to deny them a marriage license. 
So, she asked, what’s the difference between that couple and a same-sex couple that can’t naturally conceive? 
Attorney Charles Cooper, arguing in favor of California’s ban, said, ""With respect to couples over the age of 55, it is very rare that … both parties to the couple are infertile."" 
A bit later, he clarified: ""Very few men outlive their own fertility."" 
He explained that the state’s interest in marriage extends to older couples, because preserving the ""marital norm""  — with its obligations of fidelity and monogamy — discourages ""irresponsible procreative conduct outside of that marriage."" (He meant old guys having affairs with young mistresses.) 
It’s settled science that most women over 55 can’t naturally conceive. But we wondered — apart from what it may mean for the constitutionality of same-sex marriage — what does science say about men’s fertility in their declining years? 
Do ""very few men outlive their own fertility""? 
What studies say — and don’t say 
We spoke with a range of fertility experts, combed through their research, and can tell you this: Science doesn't yet tell us how many old men can make babies. 
Especially if we’re talking about natural conception of the variety that might take place if a 70-year-old is seeing a 25-year-old on the side. The kind that requires, you know, sex, and enough sperm that move vigorously enough to reach and penetrate an egg. 
(One expert told us some couples who visit fertility clinics don’t realize sex is required to make babies. We’re going to assume here that you generally get how this process works.) 
We do know that roughly 10 to 20 percent of couples generally are infertile, with the man’s fertility a factor in about 40 percent of those cases. 
But evidence is tricky when it comes to fertility as men age. 
Cooper’s office sent us links to two studies that note men make sperm late into life. But one happens to document age-related decline in sperm quality and the other notes that studies suggest men contribute to reduced fertility beginning in their early 40s. 
Here’s a roundup of points on both sides. 
Signs of late-life fertility: 
• There’s no ""cliff"" as with menopause around age 50 in women, where fertility drops off dramatically. 
• Most men still make sperm into old age, studies say. (This is different from women, who are born with all the eggs they will ever have — no making fresh ones.) 
• Sperm count, one of the most important measures of male fertility, isn’t as sensitive to age as other factors, said Andrew La Barbera, scientific director for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. 
• We’ve all heard of guys old enough to be great-grandfathers fathering kids. Or, as Justice Antonin Scalia joked in court, about the late Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who fathered four children in his late 60s and early 70s. 
Points that give pause: 
• While there’s no menopause-like fertility cliff for men, sperm quality, amount of semen and fertility do appear to decline with age. Older men may be more likely to make sperm that’s strangely shaped and doesn’t swim well. ""These data suggest that men may become progressively less fertile as they age,"" said a 2003 study cited by Cooper’s office. 
• The timing of fertility decline may vary dramatically from person to person — but there’s a need for more research to explain the variation. 
• There’s no clear research that shows how many older men may be capable of impregnating a woman in a year of regular sex, the clinical definition of fertility. 
""We don’t have data on men as they age ... not men who are in their 60s and 70s,"" said Harry Fisch, clinical professor of urology and reproductive medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College and author of The Male Biological Clock. ""Very few men in these studies are older."" 
""If it’s true, then let me ask you: Where’s the data?"" 
That point was echoed by researchers who explained the limits of current studies. 
""It is rather difficult to give a precise estimate of (men’s) fertility by age because very few are still trying to have children beyond 60 or 65 years,"" said Henri Leridon, an expert in human reproduction who headed research at France’s National Institute for Demographic Studies. 
An Israeli fertility researcher, Eliezer Girsh, told PolitiFact that not only does fertility decline in men after age 50, but that just 20 to 40 percent of men are ""still fertile in advanced age."" 
Other experts said that, frankly, there’s a need for more research. 
But anecdotes sometimes overshadow the lack of data. 
The oldest scientifically documented case of fatherhood: a 94-year-old. 
Our ruling 
Cooper argued before the Supreme Court that ""very few men outlive their own fertility."" Experts we consulted generally agree that men — or at least some men — may still father children well into their advanced years. But whether that’s most men or a minority isn’t yet supported by research. Meanwhile, emerging studies document declining fertility as individual men age, and studies don’t yet confirm how many men remain fertile their entire lives. Given the sweeping nature of Cooper's claim, and the lack of unequivocal evidence, we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/28/charles-cooper/attorney-same-sex-marriage-case-says-very-few-men-/
"['Ohio', 'Debt', 'Economy', 'Jim Jordan']","
Rep. Jim Jordan says the national debt is “larger than our entire annual economy.”
","
Budget-cutting is a favorite theme for Champaign County Rep. Jim Jordan, a former Republican Study Committee chairman with the most conservative voting record of any Ohio Congress member. Jordan has frequently opined that the controversial sequester budget cuts implemented on March 1 are a positive step toward reining in out-of-control government spending. 
On March 19, the House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs, Stimulus Oversight and Government Spending that Jordan chairs held a hearing on how several government departments decided where to make cuts required by the sequester. At the hearing, Republicans and Democrats  blamed each other for the $85 billion in cuts to government programs that were implemented after Congress failed to agree on an alternative. 
Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's representative to Congress, rattled off the list of cuts to agencies testifying before the hearing: $2 billion to the Agriculture Department, $551 million to the Commerce Department, and $17 million to the Federal Communication Commission and concluded: ""This hearing really should be entitled: 'Sequestration Oversight; What Were House Republicans Thinking.'"" 
Jordan responded to her speech by saying: ""The reason we support reducing spending in sequestration is because we have a debt larger than our entire annual economy. We do have to cut some spending around this place and we’re finally taking some modest first steps."" 
Jordan’s point about the national debt being larger than the entire U.S. annual economy is becoming a familiar GOP talking point.  A few days before Jordan spoke at the hearing,  House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan made a virtually identical statement in a speech at Washington, D.C.’s Conservative Political Action Conference, saying  ""Our debt is already bigger than our economy."" 
PolitiFact has examined that statement and several other similar ones, noting that the politicians’ government debt tally included IOUs between government agencies, which don’t affect the wider economy and credit markets as much as publicly held debt, which totals 75 percent of GDP.  
To find the size of the economy, PolitifFact national cited a Feb. 28, 2013 news release from The Bureau of Economic Analysis that put the GDP at just over $15.8 trillion. The government defines the GDP -- gross domestic product -- as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within the country. 
As for the debt, the U.S. Treasury is the go-to source. As of March 14, 2013, total outstanding public debt was $16,708,225,460,175.14. That’s broken down into two categories: debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings. 
Here are those dollar figures:  
Debt held by the public: $11.9 trillion 
Intragovernmental holdings: $4.8 trillion 
To explain the difference, we’ll borrow from our PolitiFact Texas colleagues’ handiwork. 
Intragovernmental debt refers to money owed by agencies within government to other agencies -- basically an internal accounting issue. An example: Social Security surpluses that the government uses for other federal operations. Such money will have to be repaid, it’s presumed, but the demand is less pressing right now and it doesn’t affect credit markets. 
In contrast, public debt reflects money borrowed from outside sources -- giving it more of a connection to the economy, Josh Gordon, an analyst with the anti-deficit Concord Coalition, told PolitiFact Texas. ""If your problem with the national debt is that you think it’s affecting the economy or interest rates or something like that, the only part of the national debt that affects the economy is the debt held by the public. That’s where the (U.S.) Treasury is borrowing money on the open market."" 
Paul Van de Water, an economist with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, further explained why that matters.    
""Debt held by the public is important because it reflects the extent to which the government goes 
into private credit markets to borrow. Such borrowing draws on private national saving and 
international saving and therefore competes with investment in the nongovernmental sector (for 
factories and equipment, research and development, housing, and so forth). Large increases in such borrowing can also push up interest rates and increase the future interest payments the federal government must make to foreign lenders, which reduces Americans’ income. Achieving a stable debt-to-GDP ratio is a key test of fiscal sustainability,"" Van de Water wrote in a memo. 
So, if we just consider debt held by the public -- which is what most affects the economy -- it totals about 75 percent of GDP -- which is not larger than the entire economy, as Ryan and Jordan stated. 
But the pair aren’t entirely off-base, especially since partisans tend to disagree about the importance of intragovernmental holdings. 
""When you dig a bit deeper, you hit a partisan debate about the portion of the debt not held by the public, most of which is held by the government in trust funds. Republicans say that the trust funds are filled with IOUs, which eventually will have to be redeemed with other funds. Democrats say that the trust funds represent binding promises that government has made to tens of millions of Americans. They’re both right,"" said William Galston, an expert with the Brookings Institution who was an adviser to President Bill Clinton. 
When we asked Jordan’s press secretary if there was additional information that PolitiFact Ohio should consider in evaluating her boss’ assertion, she replied: ""The facts are correct behind Rep. Jordan’s statement: economy - $15.8 trillion, debt - $16.7 trillion."" 
Jordan claimed ""we have a debt larger than our entire annual economy."" If you count debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings, the debt is roughly 105 percent of the economy, which makes his statement accurate. But the debt held by the public is more relevant to discussions about federal spending and the economy. 
With that clarification, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/28/jim-jordan/rep-jim-jordan-says-national-debt-larger-our-entir/
"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Barbara Buono']","
Barbara Buono claims New Jersey unemployment ranks higher than national average, 2 other states
","
There may be various theories about New Jersey’s improving economic climate, but for Barbara Buono, the state’s unemployment rate is the real story. 
Unemployment nationwide and in neighboring states seems to be improving, so why is New Jersey’s unemployment rate stagnant, Buono asked recently. 
""While the United States has seen its unemployment rate steadily decline, New Jersey’s remains nearly two percent higher than the national average and more than a point higher than Connecticut and New York, "" she said in response to a state Labor Department employment report released March 18. 
There are differing opinions about how unemployment should be measured but based strictly on the unemployment rate, Buono’s three points appear to be valid. 
Before reviewing the three elements of Buono’s statement, let’s define some important details. 
First, we need to know how to measure unemployment. 
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics spokeswoman Stacey Standish said it’s best to look at the unemployment rate versus the number of jobs because the rate takes population into account. 
A disproportion becomes evident when citing geographically different areas because the number of jobs lost is going to be higher in the area with a denser population, she said. 
""The unemployment rate is a better measure,"" Standish said. 
Kevin Roberts, a spokesman for Gov. Chris Christie, disputed the value of comparing rates. He said the state looks at a business survey to get a broader picture of unemployment, while the BLS uses a monthly household survey to assess unemployment and determine the rate. 
""What jobs were added, where were jobs added, in what sectors,"" Roberts said about the business survey. ""You can drill down and get a much better composite picture of what’s happening in the state, rather than the unemployment rate."" 
Now let’s look at Buono’s statement. 
The national unemployment rate was 9.8 percent in February 2010. It briefly climbed to 9.9 percent but then trended downward, lingering at 9 percent for six months of 2011. By February of this year it had fallen to 7.7 percent. So Buono is right that the U.S. unemployment rate has declined steadily. 
Next, is New Jersey’s unemployment rate nearly 2 percent higher than the nation’s? It is, but only since about July 2012, according to BLS data. 
Finally, how does New Jersey’s unemployment rate stack up against Connecticut’s and New York’s? 
Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner said Buono’s remarks cover the timeframe that Christie has been in office. Accordingly, we reviewed BLS data going back to February 2010 – Christie’s first full month in office. 
BLS data shows that New Jersey’s unemployment rate was at least 1 percent higher than Connecticut’s rate throughout 2012 and this past January. 
New Jersey’s unemployment rate was 1 percent higher than New York’s for a 22-month period from February 2010 to this past January. 
Here’s a breakdown of unemployment rates for the three states: 
New Jersey’s rate was 9.7 percent in February 2010 and 9.5 percent this past January. 
Connecticut’s was 9.2 percent in February 2010 and 8.1 percent in January. 
New York’s was 8.1 percent in February 2010 and 8.4 percent in January. 
Our ruling 
In response to unemployment numbers released in January by the state Department of Labor, Buono said, ""While the United States has seen its unemployment rate steadily decline, New Jersey’s remains nearly two percent higher than the national average and more than a point higher than Connecticut and New York."" 
Buono has varying degrees of accuracy on her three points, looking strictly at unemployment rate: the national unemployment rate has declined steadily while Christie’s been governor; the country’s unemployment rate has been nearly 2 percent below New Jersey’s, but only for about six months; and New Jersey’s unemployment rate has been more than 1 percent higher than New York’s and Connecticut’s for the bulk of the time Christie has been in office. 
Given the varying degrees of accuracy, as well as the state measuring unemployment differently from the BLS, we rate Buono’s claim Mostly True.

Ted Cruz: Democrats threatened to close Catholic Church hospitals and charities over their beliefs
","Democrats are ""fighting a war on religious liberty,"" U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz told the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 16, 2013. In his keynote speech at the event (commonly known as CPAC) held annually by the American Conservative Union, the Texas Republican equated current events to Democrats telling the Catholic Church, ""Change your religious beliefs or we'll use our power in the federal government to shut down your charities and your hospitals."" Reading that as a reference to the administration of President Barack Obama, we asked Cruz’s office for backup information. Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton, saying Cruz also was referring to congressional Democrats who voted for the health care overhaul known as Obamacare, emailed us links and articles from conservative and religious sources criticizing government decisions on how churches and affiliated organizations are to comply with the law’s mandate that insurance plans cover preventive care -- including an administration interpretation that this includes birth control without employees paying any out-of-pocket costs. None of the articles Rushton sent, though, showed Democrats or the government saying they would shut down churches’ hospitals or charities for failing to comply. A Feb. 10, 2012, PolitiFact story gave the backdrop: 2010’s health care overhaul required most health plans to cover recommended ""preventive health services"" without co-pays or deductibles. But the law left to the administration to decide which women’s health services to include. In August 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services ruled that insurance plans would have to cover sterilization and all birth control approved by the Food and Drug Administration, from condoms to hormone shots to ""morning-after"" pills, starting in August 2012 at the earliest. But according to Catholic precepts, contraception is against moral law. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops says that if contraceptives must be offered without a co-pay, that means the cost is spread among employers and all insured employees -- meaning that Catholics would end up paying for birth control. Those rules were finalized in 2012, and more changes have been proposed as of 2013, amid much public debate. In the 2012 rules, which are still in force, the government exempted some religious employers and gave them a year’s grace period before the requirements took effect. To qualify for the ""religious employer"" exemption, a group had to be a nonprofit that served and employed people who shared its religious tenets and had as its purpose inculcating religious values. But the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the governing body of the Catholic Church in this country, said that definition was too narrow because it ruled out many universities, hospitals and charitable groups, such as those that serve non-Catholics. Changes that the government proposed Feb. 1, 2013, would widen the definition of ""religious employer"" and, according to a Reuters news story posted that day, require that arrangements be made for people who work for self-insured religious organizations to get contraception coverage through private insurers. Rushton said the proposal did not go far enough and sent us material from the conservative Heritage Foundation including a Feb. 9, 2013, article saying that the ""so-called fix would only apply to certain religious nonprofit organizations, leaving many others — such as business owners, individuals, and non-religious nonprofits — without any recourse from the mandate."" Bishops’ spokeswoman Sister Mary Ann Walsh told us by email that ""massive fines for non-compliance"" would force some groups to close, and the proposed changes would not fix the situation. ""If they fail to provide coverage for contraception or sterilization in their health plans,"" Walsh wrote, ""they’re subject to an assessment of $100 a day per employee. ... And if they drop their health plans to avoid the mandate, they’re subject to an annual penalty of $2,000 per employee,"" she wrote, citing the sections of U.S. law that spell out the fines: 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(b) and 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(a), (c)(1). ""For a lot of nonprofit entities, such fines could run in the millions of dollars and would render their operations unsustainable,"" Walsh said. She did not give instances of the government threatening to directly close an institution. We searched for such communication to the church and came up empty. New York’s archbishop, Timothy Dolan, said in a Feb. 9, 2012, ""CBS This Morning"" interview that Obama had backed down from promises made during a November 2011 meeting at the White House. For his part, Obama said his administration sought to protect religious freedom with its rules for carrying out the mandate. The president said in a Feb. 10, 2012, press conference: I spoke directly to various Catholic officials, and I promised that before finalizing the rule as it applied to them, we would spend the next year working with institutions like Catholic hospitals and Catholic universities to find an equitable solution that protects religious liberty and ensures that every woman has access to the care that she needs. … The result will be that religious organizations won’t have to pay for these services, and no religious institution will have to provide these services directly. Dolan wrote in a March 2, 2012, letter to fellow bishops that ""the (p)resident announced that the insurance providers would have to pay the bill, instead of the (c)hurch’s schools, hospitals, clinics, or vast network of charitable outreach having to do so.... since a big part of our ministries are ‘self-insured,’ we still ask how this protects us."" White House staff, Dolan wrote, told bishops’ conference staffers that reconsidering the mandate and widening the exemption were off the table. Cruz’s spokesman, Rushton, said companies facing similar contraception-providing requirements have sued and gotten injunctions delaying their fines. But once those delays and the religious groups’ grace period expire, he said, ""unless they win in court or the mandate is changed, these institutions will be fined out of existence."" When we inquired, White House spokesman Eric Schultz didn’t speak directly to Cruz’s claim that government shutdowns had been threatened, but he emailed materials including a Catholic Health Association release issued Feb. 13, 2013, that said the group of nonprofit health systems was pleased with the new definition of ""religious employer"" and called the changes ""substantial progress."" Schultz also sent a Feb. 1, 2013, press release from the nonprofit advocacy group Catholics United that said the changes were a victory for the Catholic church. Alternately, Rushton said, ""The idea is, such organizations may choose to cease certain activities rather than violate their conscience."" He sent us a Feb. 28, 2012, news story from the conservative Cybercast News Service that quoted the Chicago archbishop, Cardinal Francis George, predicting his area’s Catholic hospitals and health care institutions would close within two years. At that time, George said, he saw four choices: turn secular, pay ""exorbitant"" fines that are ""not economically sustainable,"" sell out to a non-Catholic operator or shut down. Our ruling Cruz, alluding to Obamacare’s contraception insurance coverage mandate, said Democrats told the Catholic Church they would use federal powers to shut down its charities and hospitals if the church doesn’t change its beliefs. We found no sign of such a statement -- or anything close. The Catholic bishops have said that potential accumulated fines resulting from refusals to carry out the contraception mandate will cause some institutions to shut down. Perhaps. However, such prospects do not reflect a direct threat from Democrats or the government. To the contrary, the administration has moved to widen the mandate’s exemption for religious employers and provide a workaround for those who act as their own insurance providers -- with the goal of allowing affected parties to continue their work without violating or changing their beliefs. This claim proved both incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2013/mar/28/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-democrats-told-catholic-church-theyl/

Scott Henson says Texas has 11 different felonies you can commit with an oyster
","Scott Henson of Austin, who writes the Grits for Breakfast blog on criminal justice policy and politics, told the Austin Post, an online community newspaper, that Texas and the nation have ""criminalized far too much of public life."" ""I think we have somewhere in the range of 2,500 or so felonies on the books in Texas,"" Henson said in an interview posted online Feb. 25, 2013. ""There are 11 different felonies you can commit with an oyster."" That cracked our interest, partly because the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation likewise said about a month earlier that Texas has 11 felonies (not a dozen, dang it) related to harvesting oysters. Felonies are considered the most serious criminal offenses. By email, the center’s Marc Levin, director of its Center for Effective Justice, pointed out a January 2012 publication, the ""Current Offense Severity Rankings List,"" written by the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles. Henson told us by email that Levin was his source for the count when he initially wrote about the topic in 2007. He also said he would check his claim against the state’s ""offense severity"" list. Among the state-listed 2,324 felonies, Levin said, some are rather similar or are enhancements of lesser offenses, though the agency ""presumably uses a consistent methodology to delineate each separate offense."" He said the tally of oyster-related felonies aired by the foundation ""allows for some that the parole board counts as separate offenses which some might consider to be essentially the same offense."" We spotted 16 oyster-connected felonies on the list but pruned three that appeared to be duplicates. Also, as Levin noted, two felonies appeared distinct from others only because they take into consideration repeat offenses. Theft of oysters from a private bed is a felony, as is theft of oysters from a private bed and having two or more previous convictions. Similarly, harvesting oysters in a restricted area is a felony, as is oystering in a restricted area with a previous conviction. Adjusting for the seeming duplications and near-similar felonies knocked the oyster-tied felonies in state law to 11: theft of oysters placed on a private seabed; interfering with an oyster buoy or marker with two previous convictions; oystering in a restricted area as designated by the state; night dredging of oysters; night dredging in a restricted area with a previous conviction; night dredging in a polluted area; not having an oystering license; harvesting oysters for non-commercial purposes without a license; harvesting oysters without a commercial license; selling sport oysters; and violating oyster regulations. By telephone and email, a Texas Parks and Wildlife Department official confirmed the felonies, though Brandi Reeder, the agency’s fisheries law administrator, stressed that a person could be charged with each felony only if they have been convicted of similar misdemeanor violations in the previous five years--sometimes just once, in other cases two or more times, according to the relevant statutes. At our request, Reeder reviewed our identified 11 felonies, later saying by email that she would say there are seven distinct oyster-related offenses or crimes. Broadly, Reeder said, the oyster felonies are in place for a reason, to deter nefarious, potentially risky activities. ""An oyster can kill you,"" Reeder said, referring to the possible presence of viruses, bacteria and parasites in raw shellfish. ""That’s why we take it seriously."" But Texans rarely face oyster felony charges, Reeder said, because nearly all offenders stop after being charged with a misdemeanor. Statewide in the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 2012, according to the agency, no such felonies were charged. By telephone, neither Henson nor Levin expressed surprise that no oyster felonies were charged in a recent year or that no one can be charged with such a felony without a prior misdemeanor conviction. With a laugh, Henson said: ""I guess the laws worked. They stamped out oyster crime in Texas."" Henson and Levin each said, too, the oyster felonies demonstrate regulatory issues--such as having a license or fishing in restricted waters--being placed inappropriately into criminal statutes. Levin said there is an opportunity to shrink the number of state crimes starting from a Texas House proposal to create a commission that would recommend changes in advance of the 2015 legislative session. Our ruling Henson said there are 11 Texas felonies one can commit with an oyster. He could have said 16, according to the state’s breakdown of felony offenses, though Parks & Wildlife suggests such  oyster-related crimes break down to seven distinct offenses. Significantly, too, these felony charges are rare. No one can even face one without having previously been convicted of at least one related misdemeanor.

"['Ohio', 'Debt', 'Taxes', 'Rob Portman']","
Sen. Rob Portman says the national debt breaks down to $140,000 per household
","
You might not realize this but you, as American taxpayers, are deeply in debt, maybe even more deeply than your indebtedness on your mortgage. 
  
That’s one way, at least, to look at the size of the government debt that some economists say could hinder the economy for years. Rob Portman, the Republican U.S. senator from Ohio, shares that view, and on the floor on the Senate on March 21 said, ""I’m worried about where we’re headed. Our debt now is about $140,000 per household."" 
Portman was speaking in support of a Republican budget proposal, and his comments had a political flavor. We’re not here to weigh the merits of Republican or Democratic budget proposals, especially since the Senate and House budgets as passed are little more than political wish lists. But we wondered if Portman was right about the size of the debt when measured in household terms. 
This required some simple math. The current gross debt -- the total of long-term obligations by the federal government -- was $16.750 trillion the day Portman spoke, according to the Treasury Department’s debt-to-the-penny website. 
The United States had 121,084,000 households in 2012, according to estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau, with whom we checked by phone and Internet. Divide the total debt by the number of households and you get $138,334, which is less than 1.2 percent off from Portman’s figure of $140,000. 
You can examine this other ways, using other Census Bureau data; it can differ depending on which census surveys and methodologies you examine. You can even factor in different debt figures, using the debt on the day Portman spoke or the debt on the last day of 2012.  Yet none of that makes much of a difference. 
To bring this up to date in 2013, you can even use an estimate for the number of households there will be this year, and weigh it against the amount of debt subject to the limit set by Congress, since that limit is expected to be hit within months. That’s what Portman’s office did. Doing so, the household average exceeds $140,000 figure by $786. 
In other words, the senator was on or near the mark in all these cases. If this represented the non-mortgage debt on every household, your credit limit, too, might be under duress. And Portman would be correct. 
This is a hypothetical way of expressing the debt, of course, because neither party proposes paying it off equally among households. As we and our PolitiFact partners have noted before, tax rates and payments vary depending on incomes, deductions and other factors. There is no universal sum -- $140,000 or some other figure -- that each of our households actually owes. 
Furthermore, a portion of this overall debt -- $4.85 trillion, to be precise -- represents obligations that one federal agency or account owes to another, and much of that money is available through agency transfers, ordinary operations and everyday tax transactions, at least for now. Growing federal obligations to retirees could create a demand for more borrowing in the future, but the situation is not dire this very moment and Congress could act before it gets that way. 
This is why a number of economists, and the Congressional Budget Office, tend to focus on the other portion of debt -- the roughly $11.9.trillion borrowed by the government and held by creditors such as investors and foreign governments. If you used only that portion of the debt, the household average would fall considerably. 
Where does that leave Portman’s claim? 
He spoke of ""our debt."" While not a precise term, it’s another way of stating overall or gross debt. A number of economists have told PolitiFact that they worry more about the portion of debt held by the public, and less about the borrowing between intragovernmental accounts. But they have also said that when describing the national debt, it can be reasonable to express it in terms of the gross debt. 
Portman was using an average to illustrate a point, not to say that each of us needs to take out a second mortgage. 
We rate his claim Mostly True.

Carlos Trujillo says 'top advisers' to Bill Clinton and Obama drafted parent trigger bill
","
Rep. Carlos Trujillo, R-Miami, says he doesn’t know why his ""parent trigger"" bill is creating a partisan fight in the Capitol. 
Yes, it’s supported by former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, but it’s also popular with supporters of President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton, he said. 
""This legislation was drafted by President Obama's top advisers. It was drafted by President Clinton’s top advisers,"" he said on March 18, 2013, during the House Education Committee hearing on his bill. ""Gov. Bush is a big supporter of this, so it’s not a partisan issue. I’m not sure why it’s turned into that."" 
We wondered if Trujillo was right about the roots of the parent trigger bill. Did state Democrats miss the bipartisanship memo? The bill in question is HB 867, ""Parent Empowerment in Education."" The law allows parents at failing schools to demand changes, including asking for public schools to be turned into charter schools. 
Opponents say this power already exists under state and federal law, and teachers unions don’t like that public schools could be turned into charter schools. Supporters, like Bush’s Foundation for Florida’s Future, said it gives parents at those schools a ""legal seat at the table"" in turning around a school. 
California became the first state with a parent trigger law in 2010, and states including Texas and Indiana have followed in its footsteps. The nonprofit group Parent Revolution launched the California initiative and is supporting Trujillo’s bill. 
Asked to support the claim, Trujillo’s legislative aide Alex Miranda pointed us to the executive director of Parent Revolution, Ben Austin. Austin played a role in drafting the original California legislation, which was introduced by California Democratic Sen. Gloria Romero. That legislation was used as a model for Florida. 
Austin’s online biography says he has worked on several Democratic presidential campaigns and inside Clinton’s White House ""in a variety of roles."" Plus, he was ""an early supporter of Barack Obama’s presidential campaign,"" the website states. 
We asked Parent Revolution for more details about Austin’s working relationship with the presidents, as well as seven other board members and staffers whose bios included Obama or Clinton ties. 
Parent Revolution spokesman David Phelps told us the group designed California’s legislation to help that state qualify for a grant under Obama’s Race to the Top initiative. But he also said ""the usual political definition of ‘top adviser’ "" would not apply to their board members and staff. 
""President Obama has spoken frequently (as has Education Secretary Duncan) about the need for parents to be full partners in the decision-making process around their children's education,"" Phelps said. ""Parent trigger and our work at Parent Revolution is a proactive response to those Obama administration calls."" 
Phelps was not aware of Obama or Clinton publicly endorsing the measure. He also stressed that Florida is not using a carbon copy of California’s parent trigger law, as each state ""has its own specific priorities and educational needs, and state legislators write bills accordingly."" 
We caught up with Pat DeTemple, Parent Revolution senior strategist. DeTemple winced a little when we told him Trujillo’s statement. ""I don’t want to speak for Rep. Trujillo,"" he said. He touched on Austin’s ""political"" role in Clinton’s White House and ticked off a series of Austin’s Democratic credentials. 
Okay, but does that make him a top adviser to either Clinton or Obama? 
""No, no,"" DeTemple said. ""I was a general election director for Barack, and I was not a top adviser to him either, you know? 
Still, Trujillo has a point about the law attracting national Democratic support, even if Florida Democrats aren’t into it, DeTemple said. He pointed to Newark Mayor Cory Booker and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa as examples of high-profile Democrats who support the concept, as well as Obama's former chief of staff, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. 
Opponents of the parent trigger movement, such as Orlando parent advocacy group Fund Education Now, say talking up liberal credentials is an attempt by supporters of parent trigger ""to blur political lines and to declare support from Democrats for this conservative free-market effort."" 
Kathleen Oropeza, co-founder of Fund Education Now, stressed the parent trigger law was picked up as model legislation by the conservative, pro-business advocacy group American Legislative Exchange Council after California’s parent trigger law survived a legal challenge. 
She called Trujillo’s Clinton/Obama claim an overreach. 
""Ben Austin and Mike Trujillo each worked on Obama and Clinton campaigns,"" she said. ""That does not mean that Obama asked to have the trigger law written, or that he supports it."" 
Our ruling 
In trying to persuade Democrats to support his parent trigger bill, Trujillo said, ""This legislation was drafted by President Obama's top advisers. It was drafted by President Clinton’s top advisers."" He makes it sound as if the legislation were written in the West Wing. 
Parent groups, unions and activists may disagree vehemently on the bill, but they sound in agreement on one thing: The concept was not drafted by ""top advisers"" to Clinton and Obama. The people who had a hand in creating the legislation would more accurately be described as supporters of Obama and Clinton, not ""top advisers.""

Does earning $500,000 in Manhattan make you middle class?
","
How much can you make and still be middle class if you live in Manhattan? 
Sal Albanese, a Democratic former city councilman running to succeed New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, raised eyebrows with his thoughts on the number during a televised forum on March 24, 2013. 
Albanese made the claim as he was criticizing a municipal tax proposal offered by one of his rivals, Bill Thompson, the former city comptroller. 
""I disagree with Bill's proposal to tax people even more in the city,"" Albanese said, at times interrupted by cross-talk. ""As I said, what's at stake -- in Manhattan, a half a million -- half a million more in Manhattan, believe it or not, is middle class."" 
At this point, an off-screen voice shouted, ""Half a million or more is not middle class!"" 
To some laughter, MSNBC’s moderator, Chris Hayes, said that people ""are really throwing things at the television when you say that."" 
We knew that the cost of living in the Big Apple is high. But is it really true that that an annual income of half a million dollars a year in Manhattan only makes you middle class? 
Unfortunately, there is no official definition of ""middle class."" In fact, the phrase has such a mom-and-apple-pie ring to it that politicians have been using the term expansively for generations. But we’ll look at a few methods. 
One is to define the upper boundary of the middle class as twice the median income. 
Using demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau, we found that for Manhattan, the median income for all households was a little more than $66,000. Using this definition, the upper limit of the middle class would be $132,000 -- well short of $500,000. 
The second way is to break the population into three broad categories. The bottom fifth would be lower-income, the middle 60 percent would be middle-income, and the top fifth would be high-income. 
Census data shows that the someone who makes $200,000 ranks in the top 16 percent of Manhattan earners. So a household could make it into the top 20 percent with roughly $180,000 -- which once again is well short of $500,000. 
Just to be sure that Manhattan wasn’t an unusual case due to its high cost of living, we also tried to factor the Big Apple’s famously high costs. We used a city cost-of-living calculator provided by CNNMoney.com that accounts for the costs of food, housing, utilities, transportation and health care in different cities. The calculator allowed us to determine what income in other cities was equivalent to $500,000 in Manhattan. 
We found a handful of cities in which $500,000 in Manhattan money worked out to roughly $200,000 in local income -- Birmingham, Ala.; Tulsa, Okla.; Tampa; Cincinnati; Detroit; Charleston, W.Va.; Salt Lake City; Des Moines, Iowa; and Phoenix. Using Census data, we found that in each of these cities, the percentage of local households earning $200,000 ranged between 1 percent and 5 percent. 
This confirms that in this far-flung sampling of cities, earning the local equivalent of $500,000 in ""Manhattan money"" puts you in the top 5 percent of local earners. Even by the most generous definition, that’s not close to middle-class status. 
When we contacted Albanese’s campaign, a spokesman backed off the claim. Todd Brogan said Albanese got carried away during the televised appearance and defined middle class in a way he normally does not. ""It was quite frankly, a gaffe,"" Brogan said. Brogan added that the campaign had not made its backtrack official until PolitiFact asked about it. 
Our ruling 
Albanese said that an annual income of $500,000 ""in Manhattan, believe it or not, is middle class."" In reality, the upper boundary of ""middle class"" in Manhattan is probably between $130,000 and $180,000, which is well short of the level Albanese cited (a level he later backed away from). We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2013/mar/27/sal-albanese/does-earning-500000-manhattan-make-you-middle-clas/

Does chicken claim pass inspection?
","
Before you finish eating that piece of chicken, you may want to read this article. 
A recent letter to a Georgia congressman made the birds sound downright unappetizing. 
""[A] 2009 USDA study found that 87 percent of chicken carcasses tested positive for generic E. coli, a sign of fecal contamination, just prior to packaging,"" the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine wrote. 
The letter was sent to U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, a Democrat from southwest Georgia who is co-chairman of the Congressional Chicken Caucus. Yes, there is a Congressional Chicken Caucus. 
The Washington-based PCRM wants more rigid chicken inspections after the birds have been defeathered and before they hit supermarket shelves. The letter made news in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other news outlets. 
PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the physician’s committee was correct or if it ran afoul of the facts about contaminated chicken. 
The PCRM is a nonprofit organization claiming 150,000 members that promotes a vegetable-based diet, preventive medicine and alternatives to animal research. The poultry industry dismissed its criticism. 
""This petition is the latest misleading attempt by a vegan advocacy group to scare consumers in hopes of advancing their goal of a meat-free society,"" Ashley Peterson, the National Chicken Council’s vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs, told the AJC. 
E. coli are bacteria found in the droppings and intestinal systems of some animals, particularly cattle, goats and sheep. Federal officials and food safety experts say the overwhelming bulk of chicken with high levels of E. coli is caught before it reaches the grocery store or restaurant. Most outbreaks in the United States have been associated with raw or undercooked food, even cookie dough. 
An estimated 100 Americans die each year from E. coli infections, primarily from a strain typically found in beef called O157:H7. Generic E. coli found in chicken carcasses are less dangerous and ""not the type to make you sick,"" said Michael Doyle, director of the University of Georgia’s Center for Food Safety. 
Georgia may be called the Peach State, but it is also the Poultry State. Georgia produces more chickens for meat consumption -- 1.3 billion a year -- than any other state, the AJC said last year in an investigative report on food inspection. 
  
The AJC reported that federal inspectors would have one-third of a second to examine slaughtered chickens for contaminants under new rules proposed by the federal government. The USDA is still reviewing the changes, an agency spokeswoman said. 
Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer food safety group, described the inspection process is ""antiquated."" DeWaal and Doyle also want better testing for salmonella and campylobacter, bacteria that may have a greater likelihood to cause food poisoning. The PCRM, through the letter to Bishop and his caucus co-chairman, is hoping to put pressure on Congress to prod the USDA to improve its inspection process. 
""For whatever reason, the USDA knows what’s going on, but it’s not doing anything,"" said the PCRM’s Mark Kennedy, who wrote the letter. 
USDA officials counter that they used data from this and other studies conducted about the same time to make several improvements to poultry inspections since 2006, such as the agency tightening performance standards for poultry establishments. 
The PCRM has tried publicity campaigns before. Last year -- of all things! -- it warned Buffalo Bills football fans to stay away from Buffalo wings. Critics say the PCRM is truly a vegan group, has very few doctors in its membership and exaggerates the harm of meats while not focusing on the potential dangers of bacteria in vegetables. Its president, Neal Barnard, was quoted as saying chicken is ""wrongly promoted as a healthful (food) choice"" and that it carries ""its load of fat and cholesterol.""   
Fecal contamination can land on chicken feathers while they are transported, since the animals are kept in close quarters. Chickens are cleaned during the defeathering process, but some fecal contamination can still remain. 
Inspectors are charged with removing any chicken from the assembly line if they see contamination or signs of disease or infection. A few times a month, other inspectors take small samples of birds and mail them to federal labs, where they are tested for bacteria such as salmonella and campylobacter. 
USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service researchers completed a report on E. coli in chicken that was released in April 2009. The report found 691 of 798 chickens studied tested positive for E. coli, which is 87 percent. The chicken came from 20 large slaughterhouses, and the research was done in 2005. 
In 2012, the PCRM conducted its own study of chicken from 15 grocery stores chains in 10 major cities. The study found that 48 percent of the chicken samples tested positive for fecal contamination. The National Chicken Council attacked the study, saying the sample study was too small and was not peer-reviewed. 
UGA’s Doyle said the more important number when it comes to E. coli testing is the amount per gram, not its mere existence. Higher concentrations of E. coli, he said, can lead to food poisoning. Doyle said the number of E. coli per gram has declined significantly in recent years. 
""The counts have gone way down,"" he said. 
Our conclusion: 
The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, as part of a campaign to reduce fecal contamination in the nation’s food supply, claimed that a 2009 USDA study found 87 percent of chicken carcasses tested positive for generic E. coli just prior to packaging. 
The organization’s claim is based on accurate data. But we believe there’s substantial context missing. Experts say  the amount of E. coli in chicken per gram has declined in recent years, a major improvement in food safety. 
Also, the USDA study cited by the committee represents a very small sample of the billions of chicken processed each year in the U.S. It’s difficult to draw broad conclusion from such a small sample.

Jack Reed says 51,000 a year visit Roger Williams National Memorial, spending $3.2 million
","
As the political debate over the automatic budget cuts in the federal budget imposed under the so-called ""sequester"" has unfolded, there’s been a lot of discussion on the potential havoc they will wreak on the military and social service spending. But other less visible agencies are being hit as well. 
Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed took to the floor of the U.S. Senate on Feb. 27 to make just that point, lamenting cuts to the National Park Service, and how those reductions could hurt local economies. 
Reed said even in a small state like Rhode Island, they would have an effect. 
""Even Roger Williams National Memorial in my home state of Rhode Island attracted nearly 51,000 visitors in 2011, with non-local visitors adding more than $3.2 million to the local economy,"" he said. 
Good things are supposed to come in small  packages, but does the 4.5 -acre Roger Williams National Memorial really pump $3.2 million a year (about $8,767 a day) into the economy? 
While you can buy any number of books on Williams and his era in the park’s gift shop, there’s no admission charge and even the dog poop bags are free. We decided to visit the memorial, and the issue. 
Reed’s office said it got the information from the National Park Service, which tracks how many people visit its parks and other sites and how those visits contribute to local economies. When we checked with the Parks Service, we confirmed that Reed had quoted the figures accurately.   
The service put the number of recreational visits to the Roger Williams Memorial at 50,909 for 2011, the year Reed cited. It also pegged recreational spending by those people at $3.1 million, though that was based on 2010 figures. 
But are those figures realistic? 
At other parks, such as Grand Canyon or Yosemite, counting visitors is as easy as tallying how many people drove through the main gate or how many admissions were sold. 
But at an urban location such as the Roger Williams Memorial, there is no main gate, no admission paid; you just walk across the park or into the visitors center. 
National Park Service Program Manager Butch Street said that to come up with attendance figures for such sites,  the agency takes the number of people who enter the visitors center -- tracked by staff there -- and multiplies it by 3.3.   
In 2011, the year Reed noted, 15,427 people entered  the Roger Williams Memorial visitors center. Multiply that by  3.3 and you get 50,909. That method has produced annual visitor totals of more than 50,000 since 2009. 
(We did our own, extremely unscientific sample late in the morning of March 14, when it was in the low 30s and windy. One person went into the visitor center while 23 people and 1 dog walked through the park.) 
Once the park service gets the total visitor number, it plugs it into what it calls a Money Generation Multiplier. That’s a formula specifically designed to estimate how much each visitor spent. 
The formula assigns values for average spending on lodging and other purchases. The latest economic impact figures the park service has are from 2010, when the attendance formula said 51,559 visitors came to Roger Williams. 
The park service’s formula assumed those visitors generated 7,017 motel stays at about $277 per day, for around $1.94 million in spending. It also assumed 10,907 day trips to the park, at around $77 per party, for about $840,000 of spending and 2,215 camping visits at $145 a day, for about $322,000. Combined, that’s about $3.1 million into the Providence region’s economy. 
The parks service cautions that the numbers for urban sites should be seen as having a wide margin for error. 
""Due to the high number of visits at these units, small changes in assumed spending averages or segment mixes can swing the spending estimates by substantial amounts,"" it said. 
Edinaldo Tebaldi, a Bryant University assistant professor of economics who specializes in the use of statistics to track economic activity, said they got that part right. 
Tebaldi said the park service’s basic methodology was sound, in that the multipliers it used to estimate spending were generally reasonable and applied in a way consistent with professional standards. But he said his question was with the starting assumptions. 
""The report relies on several strong assumptions that are debatable,"" he said. ""However, they make it clear that that is what they are doing, so they are transparent about it."" 
The problem, Tebaldi said, is that the park service’s overall visits figure is counting people walking through the park on their way to somewhere else as visitors. 
""This is unreasonable and deserves further consideration,"" Tebaldi said.  ""The scope and size of the park makes it unreasonable to assume that it is the single driver of that many visitors to Rhode Island."" 
Our ruling 
Sen. Jack Reed said Roger Williams National Memorial attracted nearly 51,000 visitors in 2011, ""with non-local visitors adding more than $3.2 million to the local economy."" 
Reed accurately quoted figures from the park service. 
We believe you can make a case for the number of visitors, considering how many local people walk their dogs in the park or just sit on benches in the shade for a quiet lunchtime read in the summer. 
But are families from out of state packing up the minivan, driving to Rhode Island and booking motel rooms -- or campsites -- just to see the park? Not likely. 
We find the statement Half True.

Former Rep. Steve LaTourette says spending during Bush and Obama years led to the government’s fiscal problems
","
Since retiring from Congress at the beginning of this year because he was frustrated by partisan gridlock, former Bainbridge Township GOP Rep. Steve LaTourette has become head of the Republican Main Street Partnership, where he has urged more centrism and cooperation between Republicans and Democrats.

In that capacity, LaTourette has dismissed Republicans who refuse to compromise with Democrats as ""chuckleheads"" who are hindering governance. In a March 17 segment on ""Fox News Sunday"", LaTourette debated those views with a leader of the Tea Party movement, FreedomWorks president and CEO Matt Kibbe.

Kibbe told LaTourette that ""the only reason we are talking about a balanced budget, the only reason that we’re having a serious debate about $16-plus trillion in debt, is because of the Tea Party class in 2010, and the folks we had in 2012.""

""We’re never going to fix the problem just by pretending that the process of bipartisanship somehow gets to real problems, because that’s how we got here,"" Kibbe said. ""This crisis was created by both Republicans and Democrats not willing to make tough choices.""

""That flies in the face of what we did in the 1990s,"" LaTourette responded. ""Bill Clinton was the president, John Kasich was the budget chair and Newt Gingrich was the speaker and we created the Balanced Budget Act in 1997. And quite frankly, it was during the Bush years of spending, multiplied now by the Obama years that we have this mess.""

LaTourette went on to tell Kibbe the Tea Party is an important part of the Republican Party, but he believes ""just saying no doesn’t get you anything, and it creates these false crises. And you can get past the false crises if you work something out.""

In light of Kibbe’s skepticism that bipartisanship can fix the nation’s budget problems, we thought it was worth examining LaTourette’s assertion that Republicans in Congress worked with the Democratic-controlled White House in 1997 to balance the budget, and ""it was during the Bush years of spending, multiplied by the Obama years that we now have this mess.""

According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was designed to shave $127 billion from the federal budget deficit between 1998 and 2002, largely by slowing the growth of the Medicare program. After that agreement, the federal government’s revenue exceeded its spending from 1998 to 2001. Throughout that period, Clinton controlled the White House and Republicans controlled the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. President George W. Bush took office in January 2001, after the 2001 budget had been assembled by Clinton and the GOP Congress. As noted by FactCheck.org, the debt the government owes to the public decreased during this period of surpluses, but was not erased.

In 2001, CBO predicted the government would run a total of $5.6 trillion in surpluses from 2001-11, including a surplus of nearly $900 billion in 2011 alone. It forecast that the federal government’s debt would be erased by 2006, and there’d be a $2.3 trillion surplus by 2011. Instead the federal government ran $6.1 trillion in deficits, including deficits exceeding $1 trillion in each of 2009-11. Numerous organizations have analyzed what went wrong.

In an April 2011 report, the nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts said a variety of factors are responsible for the growth in federal debt since 2001. Its fiscal analysis put two thirds of the blame on legislation adopted since January 2001 that enacted roughly three dollars of new spending for every two dollars in tax cuts. It traced 13 percent of the increased debt to tax cuts that were implemented from 2001 to 2003, 10 percent to spending caused by military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, 6 percent to the Recovery Act, 3 percent to tax legislation adopted in 2010, and 2 percent to establishment of prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries.

A different nonprofit, nonpartisan economic research organization called e21 says the projected surpluses did not materialize because forecasters made inaccurate projections, such as failing to predict ""the bursting of the 1990s dot-com stock bubble, which by itself eliminated the surpluses projected for 2002 and 2003."" It said that spending increases were responsible for nearly half of the evaporated surplus, that off-base projections caused about 27 percent, and tax relief caused 24 percent.

""One major factor that worsened the fiscal outlook was a large increase in federal discretionary spending,"" said the e21 report authored by former Bush administration economic advisor Charles Blahous. ""Much of this, of course, happened after the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001. The U.S. thereafter conducted major military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and also increased expenditures on homeland security. These policies were enacted with bipartisan support, including bipartisan decisions to add their costs to the federal deficit. Discretionary spending increases further accelerated in 2009-11.""

It is clear that federal budget surpluses disappeared after 2001 for a variety of reasons. During last year’s presidential contest, a great deal of political wind was expended over whether Bush or Barack Obama was more to blame for elevated government spending since 2001. Because LaTourette said they both left a mess, it’s not necessary here to dissect how much harm was done during each presidency.

It is worth noting that Bush had a Republican Congress to back his initiatives during most of his presidency. Partway through his first term, Democrats assumed control of the U.S Senate when Vermont’s Jim Jeffords left the Republican party and announced he’d caucus with Democrats. Republicans controlled all three branches of government from 2003 through 2007. During Bush’s last two years, Democrats controlled the House of Representatives and Senate.

Obama began his term with his fellow Democrats in charge of the House and Senate. Two years later, Republicans took charge of the House of Representatives, though Democrats retained control of the U.S. Senate. That scenario persists today.

LaTourette is correct that the federal budget was balanced in the 1990s, at a time when a Democratic president was forced to find common ground with Republicans who controlled Congress. He’s also correct that the nation’s budget woes have escalated since then. Spending is no doubt a major factor, but there are a variety of reasons. With that point of clarification, we rule that LaTourette’s statement is Mostly True.

Wayne LaPierre: Michael Bloomberg says ‘we can only have three bullets’ and ‘the NRA wants firearms with nukes’
","
Who makes ""ridiculous"" claims about guns? 
The other side, of course. 
National Rifle Association executive vice president Wayne LaPierre appeared on Meet the Press on March 24, 2013, after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. 
""It’s insane the stuff he says,"" LaPierre said of Bloomberg, a co-chair of Mayors Against Illegal Guns who’s spending millions on ads in support of stricter gun controls. 
""We have people all over, millions of people, sending us $5, $10, $15, $20 checks saying stand up to this guy that says we can only have three bullets, which is what he said,"" LaPierre told host David Gregory. ""Stand up to this guy who says ridiculous things like the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them."" 
We wondered: Did Bloomberg say ""we can only have three bullets"" and ""the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them""? 
‘Three bullets’ 
We asked Bloomberg’s office and the NRA about LaPierre’s comments, and searched news databases and the Web. 
We didn’t find evidence that Bloomberg said ""we can only have three bullets."" 
He publicly endorses a ban on ""military-style assault weapons"" and ""high-capacity ammunition magazines,"" such as in a Feb. 11, 2013 letter to lawmakers from Mayors Against Illegal Guns. 
Generally, that’s meant opposition to magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, the target of legislation making its way through Congress. 
Other folks in favor of stricter gun control have argued that magazines with more than three rounds ought to be banned, such as Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., in a December interview on MSNBC. 
Has Bloomberg? Close. But not quite. 
The NRA pointed us to a Nightline interview on Dec. 20, 2012, in which the mayor says if you need more than three bullets, you’re a lousy shot. 
Anchor Cynthia McFadden asked him about the challenge of defining an ""assault weapon."" 
""Well, if it can fire a lot of bullets very quickly, that's a good place to start, okay, and then you can argue about what a lot is,"" Bloomberg said. 
McFadden starts to interject, and the mayor continues: 
""Let's pick it. Let's say three. If you haven't hit the deer with three shots, you're a pretty lousy shot. The deer deserves to get away. Let's get serious here."" 
Later, he says: 
""If it's 30 bullets, or 20 bullets or 10 bullets before you run out, I would suggest, God wants that deer to live."" 
McFadden says: ""But according to gun owners, what you've just described would ban most guns used by hunters today."" 
Bloomberg: ""If that's what they're using, for God sakes, why aren't they using dynamite? Just make it easier. I mean, what's the sport?"" 
Did that interview constitute a proposal to ban more than three bullets? 
Not according to Bloomberg’s spokesman, John McCarthy, who shared the Bloomberg speech and letter supporting legislation to ban magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. 
""Everything we have proposed has been very public. We have never proposed that,"" McCarthy said.  ""We have been very clear about what we have wanted and have seven years' worth of public advocacy, reports, press releases and more. We have never called for that, nor did he in that interview."" 
‘Firearms with nukes’ 
Did Bloomberg say ""the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them""? 
Almost. 
He said the group would support the right to own them. 
Here’s what he told MSNBC anchor Mika Brzezinski on Dec. 18, 2012’s Morning Joe: 
""The U.S. Army has a rifle — they call it a rifle. I would call it a cannon. It’s attached to the front of a tank or a moving vehicle,"" Bloomberg said. ""It shoots a nuclear warhead. The NRA would say, ‘Oh, that’s a gun. And people have a right to have that.’ "" 
(We searched for a sign the NRA would indeed say such a thing. At the moment, the group pokes fun at the idea. Meanwhile, it once blessed a ban on fully automatic machine guns, much less ones with nuclear warheads. Still, soon afterward it said it supported ""the right of law-abiding individuals to choose to own any firearm, including automatic firearms."") 
Why did Bloomberg think the NRA would support a nuclear-armed populace? 
""The NRA used to support background checks, and now they don't,"" McCarthy said. ""The mayor was using a rhetorical device to point out that if you oppose every regulation, you will allow anything."" 
Our ruling 
LaPierre claimed that Bloomberg has said ""we can only have three bullets"" and ""the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them."" He’s partially right. 
Bloomberg suggested on MSNBC that the NRA would support the right to carry a cannon firing nuclear warheads — but his point was that the organization always supports gun rights, not that it was actively promoting nuclear weapons. And while he hasn’t formally proposed a three-bullet maximum, he does support banning magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and has said anyone who needs more than three is ""a pretty lousy shot.""

Do Portland Public Schools employees pick up their share of PERS?
","
A reader alerted PolitiFact Oregon to a Portland Public Schools Board newsletter from January highlighting actions Oregon’s largest school district has taken to reduce spending.  
""Our budget reflects years of rear-guard action to protect teaching positions from state funding cuts,"" read the letter signed by members of the school board. ""For example, we have reduced the cost of pensions for all employee groups – PPS employees have paid their own PERS contributions for many years."" 
  
The reader asked us to investigate this claim, as she was surprised to learn that Portland Public Schools employees pay into their retirement. Most public employers in Oregon pay the 6 percent employer share, as well as the 6 percent employee share, into the worker’s retirement plan.  
The ""employee pickup"" infuriates Republicans and others who say public employee retirement benefits in Oregon are too generous and put other public services at risk.  
The analysis: We shot off an email to the Portland Schools spokesman. He returned with this response:  
""Per Resolution #5745, board meeting held on 11/21/1994, contributions would be paid by employee effective for any wage payment made on or after 1/1/1995,"" wrote Matt Shelby. ""So, prior to 1/1/95 PPS did pick up the 6 percent PERS contribution. After that, it was on the employee."" 
Now, we should note that in November 1994, voters narrowly approved Ballot Measure 8, which required public employees pay their share into retirement. The proposal was later invalidated by the Oregon Supreme Court, but in response some government bodies made plans to increase workers’ pay to offset the pension pickup.  
  
That’s what happened in Portland schools. Employees started paying their own retirement contributions in 1995; in exchange they received a 6 percent salary increase. The district continues to pick up the 6 percent employer share.  
Portland Public Schools is in the minority when it comes to the pickup.  
According to a 2010 PERS report, about 70 percent of active workers have their share of the pickup paid by the employer. State government does that for 100 percent of its employees. Cities and counties for 85 percent of workers. School districts pick up the employee share for only 55 percent of its workers -- the lowest of any employer group.  
The ruling: Portland schools employees have paid the employee share of PERS pickup for years. They received a salary increase in order to do so. We rate the statement True. ",/factchecks/2013/mar/26/portland-public-schools/do-portland-public-schools-employees-pick-their-sh/

Michael Bloomberg: NRA used to support more background checks
","In back-to-back appearances on Meet the Press, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the NRA’s Wayne LaPierre went another round in their duel over proposed gun legislation.   Bloomberg is pushing for universal background checks on all firearm purchases. LaPierre opposes expanded background checks. Both are working hard to discredit the other.     During Bloomberg’s segment, he told host David Gregory that once upon a time, LaPierre was in favor of the background checks he’s now fighting.     ""In fact, if you go back to 1999, Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done,"" Bloomberg said.     We’re fact-checking statements by both Bloomberg and LaPierre from Meet the Press. Here, we’ll examine the New York mayor’s characterization of what LaPierre said back in 1999.     ‘We think it’s reasonable’     On May 27, 1999, LaPierre testified before the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime. The Columbine High School shooting, in which 12 high school students and one teacher were murdered, had happened a month earlier.     To rebut what he saw as a demonization of the NRA and its members, LaPierre listed a number of actions and laws he said were good policy.     First on that list:     ""We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone,"" he said. ""That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system. This isn't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to news interviews and press appearances.""     He also spoke in favor of preventing juvenile felons from ever owning guns, setting up instant background checks at gun shows and keeping schools gun-free.     Other evidence     New York magazine, in a January 2013 story, dug up the advertising campaign LaPierre mentioned in his testimony. Titled ""Be reasonable,"" the NRA ads that ran in national newspapers said, ""We think it's reasonable to provide for instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and pawn shops. But what's unreasonable is how the proposed Lautenberg legislation ignores the 250,000 prohibited people, like felons, who've walked away from gun stores — instead of being prosecuted for a federal felony for trying to buy a gun.""     We contacted the NRA for this story but did not receive a response about Bloomberg’s claim.   In January, NRA board member Sandy Froman told CNN, ""The NRA has changed its position, and the reason it's changed its position is because the system doesn't work.""   LaPierre himself acknowledged this change in a January 2013 Senate hearing in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., elementary school shooting.     ""I do not believe the way the law is working now, unfortunately, that it does any good to extend the law to private sales between hobbyists and collectors. … The fact is, the law right now is a failure the way it's working,"" he said.     Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then said, ""I understand, back in 1999, you said no loopholes anywhere for anyone. But now you do not support background checks for all buyers of firearms?""     LaPierre responded: ""I think the National Instant Check System, the way it's working now, is a failure. Because this administration is not prosecuting the people that they catch. Twenty-three states are not even putting the mental records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent into the system. Now, assume that if you don't prosecute, and they try to buy a gun, even if you catch them, and you let them walk away, to assume they're not going to get a gun -- they're criminals, they're homicidal maniacs, and they're mentally ill. I mean, we all know that homicidal maniacs, criminals and the insane ... don't abide by the law.""     The NRA’s website on March 12, 2013, posted its firm stance against expanding background checks:     ""The NRA opposes criminalizing private firearms transfers between law-abiding individuals, and therefore opposes an expansion of the background check system.""     Our ruling     Bloomberg said that in 1999, ""Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done.""     In congressional testimony following the Columbine High School shooting, LaPierre called it ""reasonable"" to conduct a background check ""for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone."" Subsequent statements by NRA officials acknowledge that the group’s position has since changed to opposition to more background checks.     We rate Bloomberg’s statement True.  ",/factchecks/2013/mar/26/michael-bloomberg/michael-bloomberg-nra-used-support-more-background/

Fuzzy use of data undercuts marijuana arrests claim
","Weed, pot, ganja, sticky icky, cannabis. Call it what you want, some statewide advocates want it called legal.   It was more than a month before 4/20 (Weed) Day, but supporters for legalizing marijuana were out in Atlanta recently making their case to rewrite the state’s marijuana laws.Georgia has spent billions of tax dollars enforcing ""draconian"" and ineffective prohibition laws against marijuana, the supporters said during Cannabis Awareness Day at the state Capitol.     ""In Georgia, more than 35,000 arrests occur for marijuana offenses each year. Eighty-five percent of those arrests are for possession, accounting for 55 percent of all drug arrests,"" James Bell, the director of Georgia C.A.R.E. (Campaign for Access, Reform and Education), said in a news release. ""Today, March 14, about 100 people will be arrested for possession of marijuana in Georgia.""     PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know whether that many people are actually being arrested each day.     For decades marijuana has been one of the most popular drugs in the nation, even for the most famous among us. Former President Bill Clinton admitted to smoking -- although not inhaling -- it while in college. And President Barack Obama supposedly ran around his high school with the Choom Gang of marijuana-smoking buddies.     In November, voters in Colorado and Washington state approved legislation legalizing marijuana for recreational use. The drug is already legal for medical use in 18 states. But marijuana remains illegal under federal laws, although Obama has said federal law enforcers have ""bigger fish to fry"" than chasing down marijuana users.     Georgia prosecutes marijuana offenses under its Controlled Substances Act, and it has various fines and punishments for growing, buying, selling and possessing the drug. (Georgia also passed its own medical marijuana law in 1980, but the law has never been implemented.)     Bell said his numbers are derived from estimates of FBI arrest data for the state of Georgia. Doing the math on his claim, 85 percent of the 35,000 annual arrests would equal 29,750 arrests for marijuana possession. Dividing that number by 365 days, equals about 81.5 possession arrests each day.     ""We’re fed up with the whole war on drugs,"" he said. His group wanted state lawmakers to consider revising the marijuana laws as part of criminal justice reform, but none of them sponsored any legislation.     We reviewed FBI crime data and found that marijuana accounted for 52.1 percent of all arrests for drug abuse violations nationwide in 2010. And 45.8 percent of those marijuana arrests were for possession. That marijuana arrests figure dropped a bit to 49.5 percent in 2011, with 43.3 percent of those marijuana arrests being for possession.     Marijuana policy researcher Jon Gettman forwarded to PolitiFact data he compiled from FBI data on the same subject. According  to that data, Georgia’s marijuana arrests were:     Year        All marijuana arrests        Marijuana possession arrests   2008            30,289                    26,978 2009            33,200                    28,892 2010            31,506                    28,091   Gettman, a criminal justice professor at Shenandoah University, has also been a past president and national director of NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.     But calculating arrests is a tricky undertaking, Robert Friedmann, a criminology professor at Georgia State University, reminds us. Arrest numbers are nebulous, he said, depending on the way they are counted: Are multiple arrests for a single person counted individually? Do the numbers include local, state and federal activities? Do all jurisdictions report arrests?     An explanation of arrest data on the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program states that the report counts one arrest for each separate instance in which a person is arrested, cited or summoned for an offense. Because a person can be arrested multiple times, the FBI report doesn’t reflect the number of people who have been arrested, but the number of times people are arrested.     So what’s the skinny?     Marijuana legalization advocate James Bell said about 100 Georgians are arrested each day on charges of marijuana possession.     Bell’s claim is based on FBI crime report arrest data. Using that data from the years 2008 through 2010, an average of about 28,000 possession arrests were recorded in Georgia each year. Dividing the average annual possession arrests by 365 days results in about 76.7 marijuana possession arrests each day.     Bell uses that arrest data to estimate the number of people arrested for the violation. But the FBI clearly states this type of estimation that Bell claims is not reflected in their numbers. Individuals can be arrested multiple times for the same infraction, so the FBI’s arrest data indicate the number of arrests -- not the number of people arrested -- for any particular infraction.     Based on this explanation, Bell’s claim seems to be up in smoke.     We rated Bell’s claim Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2013/mar/26/james-bell/fuzzy-use-data-undercuts-marijuana-arrests-claim/

A driverless car has gone 300,000 miles without an accident, says Jeb Bush
","
Imagine while fighting through traffic that you could paint your toenails, play the guitar or read a novel -- but safely, because the car would be doing all the driving. 
We’re not talking about a Jetsons make-believe scenario here: Several companies have autonomous or self-driving cars in the works. (Spoiler alert: the scenario we describe could be years away, and you might have to pay attention enough to grab the wheel.) 
Former Gov. Jeb Bush mentioned such cars as an example of technological innovations during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 15, 2013. 
""Driverless vehicles will flawlessly move people and products across our highways, never getting lost, never having accidents,"" said Bush, a potential Republican 2016 presidential candidate. ""Already, a prototype driverless car has traveled more than 300,000 miles in the crowded maze of California streets without a single accident."" 
Has a driverless car really traveled 300,000 miles on crowded California streets without a single accident? PolitiFact hit the virtual road to find out. 
A ride in a driverless car 
Several car companies are developing so-called autonomous or self-driving cars operated by computers. But they may not be publicly available for at least a decade if not longer. 
Among the challenges are the legal questions of who faces liability when a driverless crashes, as well as bringing down the $100,000 price tag for the technology. 
But the technology is cool. Check out this Google video of a blind man taking a ride in the driver’s seat to Taco Bell (""Look ma no hands!""). 
A recent Forbes story offered a good first-hand account of riding at 65 miles per hour around Silicon Valley in a Lexus equipped with Google’s technology. 
When a slow-moving truck merged onto the highway, the Google car hit the brakes on its own; the car also tracked a tailgater and a motorcyclist weaving in traffic. 
The article explained that Google engineers gather information about the route and add it to maps before the self-driving takes off. 
""When it’s the autonomous vehicle’s turn to drive, it compares the data it is acquiring from all those sensors and cameras to the previously recorded data,"" Forbes reported. ""That helps it differentiate a pedestrian from a light pole."" 
The car has limitations. A Google official said that the car can’t handle heavy rain and or snow-covered roads, and engineers are working on how to handle encountering a stalled car or a tire in the middle of the road. 
Florida, California and Nevada have all passed laws that allow testers to operate so-called autonomous cars. 
In 2012, the Florida Legislature passed a law that requires humans in the cars to intervene if necessary. Testers must submit proof of $5 million in insurance. As of March 21, no testers have registered, said Leslie Palmer, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. 
Bush’s spokeswoman referred us to an August 2012 Google blog: ""Our vehicles, of which about a dozen are on the road at any given time, have now completed more than 300,000 miles of testing. They’ve covered a wide range of traffic conditions, and there hasn’t been a single accident under computer control."" 
Of those 300,000 miles, Google co-founder Sergey Brin said: ""I think we’ve done 50,000 miles now without safety critical intervention. But that’s not good enough…The self-driving car is going to face greater scrutiny than any human would. And I think that’s appropriate."" 
A Google spokesman gave PolitiFact Florida a statement after Bush’s speech that the cars have actually driven over 500,000 miles on public roads. 
A Google car crash -- near headquarters 
Google did face scrutiny in August 2011 when several blogs and news reports highlighted a car crash involving such a car near Google’s Mountain View headquarters. 
""This photo of what looks like a minor case of Prius-on-Prius vehicular violence may actually be a piece of automotive history: the first accident caused by Google's self-driving car. Whose name should the cop write down on the ticket?"" wrote the Jalopnik blog. 
But Google said a human being was manually controlling the car when the accident occurred. 
Mountain View police referred PolitiFact Florida to a Mountain View Voice article which quoted a police spokeswoman: 
""Since it involved five vehicles, we wanted to make sure there were no injuries and facilitate the exchange of names. Essentially, it was five-car fender-bender. No one reported any injuries and so the officer simply facilitated the exchange of names. No case was taken."" 
The article also said that ""Google claims the Google car was in between tests and that the accident was on a road that had not been mapped previously to allow it to drive autonomously on that section of street."" 
Popular Mechanics wrote that it had no reason to doubt Google’s word that a human caused the crash but noted, ""With this accident, there's not much to go on besides Google's word."" The crash raised the question if companies will provide law enforcement full access to verify if a person was driving at the time of the accident. 
The only other report of a crash we could find was a New York Times 2010 story that said a Google car was rear-ended at a traffic light. Being rear-ended usually means the other driver is considered at fault. 
Experts raise some caveats about the cars 
We ran Bush’s claim by Bryant Walker Smith, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School, who wrote a paper on the legality of automated cars. (The center publicly discloses its donors, which include Google and some car companies.) He said driverless cars haven’t traveled enough miles yet to prove their safety. 
Based on the number of car crashes in the United States and the miles traveled, he concluded that Google's cars would need ""to drive themselves (by themselves) more than 725,000 representative miles without incident for us to say with 99 percent confidence that they crash less frequently than conventional cars. If we look only at fatal crashes, this minimum skyrockets to 300 million miles. To my knowledge, Google has yet to reach these milestones."" 
Smith said that Bush’s claim is a good faith summary of the media reports; however, it omits some caveats. 
""These are testers who are being closely supervised by highly trained drivers who do occasionally intervene in the operation,"" he said. ""That is very different from sending a vehicle unmonitored through a variety of road conditions. ... Although Google has logged impressive miles, and demonstrated other statistics that they are more safe than human drivers, that is not publicly documented at this point and there is an incredible amount of research required."" 
He also said we shouldn’t expect cars that function completely without human intervention of some sort. 
""‘Driverless car’ is probably not the right word for the kind of vehicle we are talking about,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. ""Driving will be shared with a computer either simultaneously or sequentially. A human may need to do some functions of the driver, and the computer may augment functions of humans depending on road conditions and kind of road."" 
Our ruling 
During his CPAC speech, Bush talked about technological innovations underway and that will occur over the next 100 years.   
""Already, a prototype driverless car has traveled more than 300,000 miles in the crowded maze of California streets without a single accident,"" Bush said. 
We don’t fault Bush for citing the 300,000 figure rather than the recent 500,000 figure, because that higher number only received publicity after the CPAC speech. 
But technically, Bush was wrong to say that the prototype car has driven in California ""without a single accident."" We found two accidents, but they both had mitigating factors. One car was rear ended, which suggests another driver was at fault. In another accident, a human was operating the car, at least according to Google. 
Still, we couldn’t find one incident where a driverless car operating under its own technology clearly caused an accident. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/25/jeb-bush/driverless-car-has-gone-300000-miles-without-accid/

Walker says Doyle cut education funding without giving districts a way to make it up
","
In his March 16, 2013 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Gov. Scott Walker criticized the way Wisconsin cut education funding before he took office. 
In blaming union rules and former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle for the layoff of an award-winning young English teacher in Milwaukee Public Schools, Walker explained: 
""You see, under my predecessor, they cut funding for education, but they didn't give them anything in return to make up for that. So what happened? When you have less money in those situations, even though she was named one of the best teachers in the state in her profession, what happened to her?"" 
Walker answered his own question: 
""She was one of the first to be laid off. Why? Because under the old system of collective bargaining, one of the last hires is the first fired."" 
We wondered about Walker’s claim that under Doyle, Democrats cut school funding but didn’t give districts ""anything in return to make up for that,"" resulting in ""less money"" for local districts such as MPS. 
Some background first. 
It may not have been well known to Walker’s audience, but as PolitiFact Wisconsin found, Walker and legislative Republicans enacted the biggest cuts to education in state history in his first budget. 
But Walker’s 2011-’13 budget also allowed many, but not all, school districts to at least partially offset the impact of those cuts by taking advantage of the union limits in his budget. 
Specifically, they could impose -- rather than attempt to negotiate -- greater cost-sharing from school employees for health insurance and pension benefits. The collective-bargaining curbs also ended protection for seniority, which partly explains the MPS layoff story Walker related. 
That freedom to cut costs is the something ""in return"" that Walker’s speech said Doyle did not provide. 
So let’s look at both the cost and revenue side of the equation as we judge Walker’s claim that Doyle cut school funding and did it in a way that didn’t give local school districts any way to make up for the lost aid. 
Reductions in state aid 
Let’s take the easy part first. 
It’s less well known, but still a fact, that Doyle -- facing a budget shortfall during the Great Recession -- cut state aid to schools in his final budget (2009-’11). The cut was about 3 percent in the first year of that Doyle plan, while in the second year school aids were basically flat. 
For the record, Walker’s cut was deeper, about 8 percent in year one of his 2011-’13 budget, followed by a 1 percent increase in year two. 
But state aid is just one of the big revenue streams for schools. The other is local property taxes. The state regulates how much state aid and property tax school districts can raise, in combination, by limiting the annual increase in the ""revenue limit"" for each district. 
That brings us to the guts of Walker’s claim. 
Doyle, while cutting state school aid, let the ""revenue limit"" rise. 
""Districts were allowed to replace the lost aid with additional property taxes,"" noted Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance.   
So Doyle, contrary to Walker’s claim, did offer something ""in return"" to districts -- though not every district might have been able or willing to levy enough new taxes to cover the difference. 
To be sure, Walker doesn’t think much of that approach. 
Walker took the opposite tack. He not only declined to raise the revenue limits, he actually reduced the amount districts could take in between taxes and state aid combined. 
The effect was property tax relief -- there was a small decline statewide in property taxes levied for schools in Walker’s first two years, compared with annual increases of 6 percent and 3 percent in Doyle’s last two years, state figures show. 
Less money for districts? 
The second major element of Walker’s claim was his suggestion that Doyle’s approach resulted in ""less money"" for districts, thereby forcing teacher layoffs. 
That’s off base on the revenue side, because while districts got less state money under Doyle, they could raise more local funds. Some even increased their spending because Doyle allowed them to raise more in property taxes. 
But there’s some truth to Walker’s phrasing if you look at the cost side of the money equation. 
Doyle’s last budget actually throttled back how large a property tax increase local districts could approve. 
So the effect was that districts could not raise taxes as much as they may have planned. And lacking the freedom that Walker would later give them, districts couldn’t cut benefits unilaterally to cover the difference because labor contracts were still in place. 
In some districts, MPS being one of them, they had to turn to staff cuts in the final year of the Doyle budget. The revenue cap, as well as growing costs and declining enrollment, contributed to the need for layoffs, MPS spokesman Tony Tagliavia said. 
We should note that Walker’s approach also led to staff reductions, including layoffs, and the cumulative reductions statewide were steeper in Walker’s first year than in Doyle’s last. 
Our rating 
Walker contended that under his Democratic predecessor, school funding was cut but the state didn’t give school districts ""anything in return to make up for that."" That, he said, resulted in ""less money"" for local districts. 
This is a mixed bag. Aid was cut by Doyle, and Doyle’s slowing of overall revenue growth by districts did squeeze some and force layoffs. But it’s not true that Doyle gave districts no way to address shortfalls; unlike Walker he allowed local property taxes to rise. 
On balance, we rate Walker’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/25/scott-walker/walker-says-doyle-cut-education-funding-without-gi/
