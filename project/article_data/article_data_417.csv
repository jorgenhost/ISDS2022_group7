Joe Biden overstates how well vaccines prevent person-to-person virus spread
","During a visit to a construction site near Chicago, President Joe Biden promoted his policies to increase vaccination rates, arguing that beating back the coronavirus is the best way to boost the nation’s economy. ""My administration is now requiring federal workers to be vaccinated,"" Biden said on Oct. 7. ""We’ve also required federal contractors to be vaccinated. ... We’re requiring active duty military to be vaccinated."" Biden then addressed vaccine requirements for medical workers: ""We’re making sure health care workers are vaccinated, because if you seek care at a health care facility, you should have the certainty that the people providing that care are protected from COVID and cannot spread it to you."" Some critics of Biden suggested that he had left an inaccurate impression — that if you're vaccinated, you can't spread the virus. Those critics had a point: Biden did overstate the degree to which vaccination curbs an individual’s ability to spread the virus to someone else. (The White House did not respond to inquiries for this article.) In fact, this is the stated position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In a discussion of the more readily transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus published on Aug. 26, the CDC wrote that ""fully vaccinated people with delta variant breakthrough infections can spread the virus to others.""  Experts contacted by PolitiFact agreed.  Biden ""should not be so firm"" in his phrasing, said Tara C. Smith, a Kent State University epidemiologist. ""Vaccination does significantly reduce transmission from vaccinated breakthrough cases but does not completely eliminate it."" Babak Javid, a professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco, said there are ""many examples of onward transmission from vaccines,"" even beyond the most well-known example, an outbreak in the summer of 2021 that included many vaccinated people in Provincetown, Mass. So Biden is exaggerating when he suggests that someone who is vaccinated ""cannot spread"" the virus. But scientists agree that vaccination does cut transmission of the coronavirus significantly, even for the delta variant. For starters, vaccination makes it less likely that someone will be infected with the virus in the first place. But even beyond that, vaccinated people who do contract the virus have been found to be infectious for a shorter time than those who aren’t vaccinated. For instance, a study from Singapore found that virus levels dropped quickly after infection among people who had been vaccinated. ""This makes sense, since the immune response from the vaccination is coming in to fight the virus,"" said Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco. And the shorter someone is at peak infectiousness, the less likely they are to transmit the virus to others. RELATED VIDEO   Here are some studies that show a reduction in transmission by vaccinated individuals: • An Oxford University study of contract-tracing data from 100,000 initial cases in the United Kingdom found that vaccination reduced transmission of the delta variant, despite similar viral loads between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects. Contacts who had received the Pfizer vaccine, which is also used in the United States, were 65% less likely to test positive than people who had not been vaccinated. The AstraZeneca vaccine, which is not approved for use in the United States, reduced positive tests by 36%. (The study did find that the effectiveness in preventing transmission waned with time.) • A study from Umeå University in Sweden found that people without immunity were at a significantly reduced risk of being infected if family members were vaccinated or had experienced a previous coronavirus infection. This reduction ranged from 45% to 97%, depending on how many other family members were infected.  • A study from the Netherlands looked at infections among more than 24,000 health care workers. It found that infectious virus shedding was lower among vaccinated individuals who had been infected than it was among those who were unvaccinated.  Biden said that people who are vaccinated for the coronavirus ""cannot spread it to you."" That’s overstating the case. Multiple studies show that a vaccinated person is significantly less likely to pass the coronavirus to someone else than an unvaccinated person is, but the transmission risk is not reduced to zero.

No, Pfizer didn't admit that its vaccine isn’t FDA-approved
","A recent blog post headline says that President Joe Biden is ""busted."" Why? Because, as the headline continues, ""Pfizer admits there’s no vaccine approved by FDA in the U.S.""  ""Joe Biden and his regime have stated that Pfizer’s COVID vaccine has FDA approval,"" the Oct. 10 post says. ""Someone recently recorded a call of Pfizer saying something completely different.""  A video of what appears to be a recording of a call with someone at the ""Pfizer customer response center"" is embedded in the post. During the purported call, a person tells the caller that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine hasn’t been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and that it’s only received the FDA’s emergency use authorization.  We don’t know if the recording is authentic, and if it is, when it took place.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine received FDA approval for people 16 and older on Aug. 23.  Before that, the vaccine was authorized for this group under an emergency use authorization. And the vaccine is still only available for 12-15 year olds under emergency use authorization because it hasn’t yet been approved by the FDA for people between those ages.  ""I can confirm that our vaccine has been granted FDA approval,"" Pfizer spokesperson Keanna Ghazvini told PolitiFact on Oct. 13.  She pointed us to two press releases, one from Pfizer on Aug. 23 announcing that the company had received ""full U.S. FDA approval for individuals 16 years and older,"" and one from the FDA the same day that said it had approved the first COVID-19 vaccine.  During public health emergencies, the FDA has the power to grant emergency use authorization to products that meet specific criteria when there’s no adequate, approved and available alternative to treat a disease — in this case, COVID-19.  When COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in early 2020, there weren’t any approved vaccines for it, so the FDA granted emergency use authorization in December 2020 to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and in February 2021 to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. All three were evaluated for their safety and efficacy before being authorized. The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines have not yet received FDA approval and remain under the emergency use authorization.  The recording in the blog post is described as a Pfizer customer service representative saying that the vaccine hasn’t been approved. If she said that after Aug. 23 about the 16-and-up group, she was wrong. But in any case, that doesn’t amount to the company admitting that the vaccine didn’t receive FDA approval.

Yes, Pentagon’s annual budget is twice the spending proposed to pay for Build Back Better Act
","Government spending is front and center in Washington D.C., where Congress narrowly averted a government shutdown and lawmakers continue to fight over increasing the nation’s debt ceiling and haggle over spending on infrastructure and the rest of President Joe Biden’s agenda. While the numbers are massive -- a trillion here, a trillion there -- U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, a Madison Democrat, tried to put some perspective on it all with this Oct. 3, 2021 tweet: ""The annual Pentagon budget hovers over $750 billion annually, twice that of the much debated Build Back Better Act that costs about $350 billion annually as currently proposed. And the Build Back Better Act is PAID for, unlike the Pentagon’s budget (which we don’t even audit!).""  For the purpose of this fact check, we’re going to focus on the first part of the claim.  Is the Pentagon’s budget really around $750 billion annually? And what would the proposed Build Back Better Act cost each year? First, let’s dig into the Pentagon budget.  When asked for backup, Pocan’s office sent us the House of Representatives summary of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2022, the most recent Pentagon funding approved. According to the document, for 2022, the Pentagon is slated to receive about $768 billion. His office also provided a link to the Senate-passed National Defense Authorization Act for 2022, which had a topline of nearly $778 billion.  For reference, in the 2021 bill passed by the House, nearly $732 billion was authorized, and the Senate authorized about $741 billion in spending.  So Pocan is on target on the military spending. There is some confusion about the many packages and measures at play in Washington, as Democrats -- who very narrowly control the House and Senate -- try to sort out what they can pass, and how to proceed. Build Back Better, of course, sometimes refers to Biden’s overall agenda. But in this case, Pocan is talking about a specific bill -- the one where Democrats have stitched together a wide range of proposals, from two free years of community college to cutting prescription drug prices, even measures to address climate change. This is sometimes referred to as the ""human infrastructure bill.""  Its fate is tied to that of a bill for more conventional infrastructure -- roads, bridges and the like -- that has already passed the Senate. There, it won support from 19 Republican senators, including U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, after negotiations to make it a bipartisan effort, according to the New York Times. It carried a price tag of $1 trillion.  Meanwhile, the so-called Build Back Better Act, the one mentioned earlier, carried a price tag of $3.5 trillion at the time of Pocan’s tweet. Since then, Democrats have been whittling the figure down, though it’s unclear precisely where it will land. But if the measure costs $3.5 trillion, isn’t Pocan way off? Not exactly. A little-discussed aspect of the plan is that the spending covers a 10-year period. So, to get to the $350 billion a year figure, Pocan is simply dividing by 10. Of course, because it has not been passed, it is hard to say just how the money will be apportioned -- that is, will it be split evenly year-to-year, or be front-loaded, or take some other format. Regardless, we think the average is a reasonable way to look at it. Of course, the amount of money the bill adds up to is likely to change, too. The plan is being scaled back again, to a top line of about $2.3 trillion, though that number could get even smaller in the weeks ahead, according to an Oct. 5, 2021 report from the New York Times. In a tweet, Pocan claimed the Pentagon’s annual budget is twice that of the spending that would be authorized under the Build Back Better Act being hammered out in Congress. Over the last several years, the Pentagon’s budget has hovered around $750 billion a year, while the piece of spending Pocan referred to -- the so-called ""human infrastructure"" bill was estimated at about $3.5 trillion at the time of his tweet. That spending, though, is for a 10-year period. To be sure, we don’t know how that spending would be broken down, year to year. But, when averaged out, it falls to the figure Pocan used.  We rate the claim True.

Deaths from abortions still happen, but they declined sharply after Roe v. Wade
","Texas’ new far-reaching anti-abortion law has renewed calls from abortion-rights advocates to protect Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that recognized a constitutional right to an abortion. An Oct. 7 Facebook post joined those calls, advocating for Roe on the grounds of safety. The post featured a picture of what appeared to be a yard sign that read: ""Roe wasn’t the beginning of women having abortions. Roe was the end of women dying from abortions."" The Facebook user posted a caption along with the photo that read: ""Tens of thousands of American women died while having unsafe back alley abortions before Roe v. Wade. We CAN’T go back.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Did Roe v. Wade put an end to abortion-related deaths in the U.S.? The answer isn’t so simple. The number of women dying from causes related to abortion had been declining in the decades before Roe, thanks to medical advances and changes in state laws, and deaths still occur. But deaths from illegal abortions plummeted to a few, if any, in most years since the decision, and the mortality rate from legal abortions has fallen substantially. Because of the historical stigma attached to getting abortions, there is limited data available about the number of women who died as a result of the procedure. ""Deaths for example were often coded as due to other causes to save families from shame, and we can only rely on estimates for illegal abortions,"" said Carole Joffe, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, who specializes in reproductive health and has extensively researched access to abortion services. ""No one was keeping careful track."" However, research suggests that even before the Roe decision, abortions were becoming less deadly than they had once been, with estimates of annual deaths dropping from the thousands in the 1930s to 260 in 1957. The discovery and popularization of antibiotics helped improve the safety of abortions, according to a 1948 study published in the American Journal of Public Health. That study also mentioned that the increased use of contraceptives had reduced the need for illegal abortions, leading to fewer deaths. A 1978 American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology study analyzed trends in abortion deaths in the U.S., and determined that from 1940 to 1950 and after 1965, ""deaths from abortion declined more rapidly than deaths from other causes associated with pregnancy and childbirth.""  The Food and Drug Administration in 1960 approved the first commercially produced birth control pill and in the three years before Roe was decided, abortion had become legally available in a handful of states. That study concluded that ""the introduction of more effective contraception, and increased availability of legal abortion"" were the two most likely explanations for the ""accelerated decline in abortion-related deaths."" By the early 1970s, abortion-related deaths had become relatively rare. In 1972 — the year before Roe was decided and the first year for which data for abortion-related deaths was available — 24 women died from legal abortions, and 39 died from illegal abortions, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (The CDC categorizes an abortion as legal when it is performed by a licensed clinician within the limits of state law.) The number of deaths related to illegal abortions decreased to 19 in 1973 and dropped further, to six, by 1974, CDC data shows. From 1979 to 2017, the number of women who died in a year was never higher than two. Meanwhile, as deaths from legal abortions fluctuated in subsequent years, mortality rates declined. A study by the Guttmacher Institute, a global research group that supports women’s access to abortions, determined that as legal abortion access increased after Roe, ""mortality due to abortion dropped sharply."" ""The trend was caused mainly by a decline in the absolute number of deaths from illegal abortion — especially after Roe v. Wade — from 39 in 1972 to two in 1976,"" the study concluded based on CDC data. ""After 1975, mortality due to legally induced abortion also fell — from more than three deaths per 100,000 abortions in 1975 to about one in 1976 and even fewer thereafter."" Studies show that abortion rates are similar, regardless of whether or not a country has legalized the procedure. Along with legal changes, medical advances play a role in reducing deaths.  In countries where abortions are illegal, they are less deadly today than they once were. One factor is the changing methods used to induce abortions. A relatively common and inexpensive drug, misoprostol, is commonly used to end pregnancies, for example. ""The same safe pills that one can get in an abortion clinic, one can order online,"" Diana Greene Foster, another UCSF professor specializing in reproductive health, told PolitiFact in an email. ""So the relationship between safety and illegality is likely less clear-cut now as long as pregnant people get the right pills."" A Facebook post claimed, ""Roe was the end of women dying from abortions."" A caption on the post alludes to deaths from illegal abortions in non-clinical settings. Deaths from abortions were already becoming relatively rare by the time Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, as a result of medical advances and legal changes at the state level. But studies and experts say increased access to legal abortion after Roe v. Wade sharply reduced the number of pregnant women who died because of illegal abortions.  CDC data shows that the number of women who died from causes related to illegal abortions was zero or close to zero for most years from 1979 to 2017. Mortality rates for legal abortions have declined over the same period. Roe was an important factor in reducing deaths from abortions, but not the only one.

"['Debt', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Joe Biden']","
Is Joe Biden right that debt limit increase ‘has nothing to do with new spending’?
","As a breach of the nation’s debt ceiling loomed earlier this month, President Joe Biden urged quick action by lawmakers. The nation’s debt ceiling approximates the credit limit on a credit card: It’s a dollar figure that constrains how much debt the federal government can carry at a given time in order to pay for its operations.  The nation was poised to hit its limit on federal debt in mid-October, imperiling all kinds of federal payments, especially interest on government bonds, which could have triggered a national and international financial crisis. On Oct. 6, Biden urged Republicans not to use procedural maneuvers to block an increase in the debt ceiling, arguing that too much would be at risk if the United States defaulted on its debts. ""Let’s be clear,"" Biden said. ""Raising the debt limit is paying our old debts. It has nothing to do with new spending or what may be coming this year or other years. It has nothing to do with my plans on infrastructure or Building Back Better, both of which are paid for but they’re not even in — in the queue right now."" Biden had a point about the most direct causes of the need to raise the debt ceiling; in fact, Republicans who said the immediate debt ceiling increase was needed because of new programs proposed by Biden were incorrect. However, Biden left out some important context. Here’s where Biden is on solid footing: His new spending initiatives are not to blame for the immediate need to raise the debt ceiling.  Neither his ""human infrastructure"" bill, which focuses on things like childcare, student aid, prescription drug prices and Medicare, nor his more traditional infrastructure bill addressing transportation and energy were the proximate cause of the debt limit increase he sought.  ""The president is correct that we are having to raise the debt limit because of past spending and revenue decisions,"" said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""The reason it has to be raised are for past decisions that are ongoing."" In fact, since the bipartisan infrastructure bill hadn’t yet been passed by the House — and since the text of the human infrastructure bill hadn’t even been nailed down yet by negotiators — there was no spending from either bill that would have required an urgent increase in the debt ceiling. While Biden’s future infrastructure bills were not related to the immediate call to raise the debt ceiling, they could have an effect should they become law.  If they are enacted, they would shift from theoretical plans to actual spending. This, in turn, would increase the fiscal pressure on the U.S. and add to the need to increase the debt ceiling in the future. There would be one way to relieve that pressure: The two bills backed by Biden could be written in a way that they’re fully ""paid for"" through new revenues that offset the new spending and tax cuts.. That’s theoretically possible, but it would not be easy. Biden projected that his budget proposal would be paid for over the first 15 years and would reduce annual deficits after that. But that was before he split his agenda into two bills, one of which hasn’t been fully assembled yet, so it’s impossible to know whether that’s feasible yet. And the only independent analysis of the bill that’s been completed so far — the bipartisan infrastructure measure — didn’t support Biden’s pledge. In isolation, the analysis found, the bipartisan bill would add to the federal debt. The Congressional Budget Office, which is Congress’ official budgetary scorekeeper, has determined that the bipartisan bill would add at least $256 billion to the debt over 10 years. Outside groups, after sifting through the CBO’s assumptions, have said the actual impact would be even higher. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscally conservative group, calculated that indirect spending increases contained in the bill would push that figure to just shy of $400 billion over 10 years. (There are additional revenue streams not considered in CBO’s analysis that could ease the fiscal imbalance, such as the reallocation of unused funds from coronavirus relief legislation or unused unemployment insurance.) The second piece of legislation, the ""human infrastructure"" bill, isn’t finalized yet, so it’s impossible to know whether it will end up fully paid for. But as challenging as it would be to fully pay for a bill estimated to cost between $1.5 trillion and $3.5 trillion, the second bill would actually have to include $400 billion in excess revenue if it is going to cover the revenue shortfall from the bipartisan infrastructure bill. If it doesn’t, then the bills collectively would add to the federal debt and require a debt ceiling increase, sooner or later. In addition, even if the bills are fully paid for over 10 years, which is the standard CBO yardstick, new spending may exceed new revenues for a portion of that decade before they end up in balance, Ellis said. It’s worth noting that, compared to the size of the federal debt, the additional pressure from even two big bills like Biden’s would be modest, said Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""This increase is small compared to the $12 trillion in debt that would be added in those years"" under existing obligations, Van de Water said. It’s also important to remember that, unless lawmakers get rid of the debt ceiling mechanism altogether, it will continue to crop up periodically based on ongoing spending requirements having nothing to do with Biden’s proposals. ""The debt ceiling will have to be raised periodically as long as the federal government continues to run deficits, which is likely to be for the foreseeable future,"" Van de Water said. Federal borrowing needs are determined by ""the underlying tax and spending legislation — almost all of which, like Social Security and Medicare, is already in place."" For this, both parties are responsible, experts say. Much of the recent growth in the debt stems from bipartisan coronavirus relief, while some came from the 2017 GOP-backed tax cut and some stemmed from the 2021 Democratic-backed American Rescue Plan. ""Neither party can credibly claim the debt is solely the other party’s fault or the other party’s responsibility,"" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote. Biden said, ""Raising the debt limit is paying our old debts. It has nothing to do with new spending."" New spending initiatives, such as the two bills Biden is currently backing in Congress, were not the immediate cause of the debt limit increase that Democrats in Congress enacted. But if they become law, they will likely increase the fiscal pressure on the U.S. and add to the need to increase the debt ceiling in the future.

That’s the exaggerated claim made in a viral image that says: ""How Many Citizens Are Actually Aware Under Part 2 Of The Infrastructure Bill, Upon Death The Entire Value Of Your Accumulated Wealth & Estate Will Be Taxed At 61%?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biden did make such a proposal — but it would have applied to few estates, only those worth nearly $12 million or more.  Moreover, the proposal is not currently included in a budget reconciliation bill being debated in Congress. Biden’s American Families Plan (not his infrastructure plan), which was released in April, included two proposals to end what it described as tax ""loopholes"" for the rich. They would have covered capital gains and estates. Capital gains taxes apply to the appreciation of an asset. A capital gain is the difference between the cost of the asset when you bought it and the value of the asset when you sell it.  Estate taxes apply to the value of an estate when the owner dies and the assets are distributed to others. Broadly speaking, the Biden proposals would have raised the top capital gains tax rate to match the rate on earned income, and changed the way capital gains are calculated on inherited assets, so that a greater share of investment gains would be subject to capital-gains and estate taxes.  But the two changes would have applied to very few estates — only those worth more than $11.7 million that also had unrealized capital gains worth more than $1 million.  On a $100 million estate, according to the Tax Foundation, the combination of the two Biden proposals would have resulted in a tax of $61 million, or an effective tax rate of 61%.  But the two proposals are not part of the budget reconciliation bill approved Sept. 15 by the House Ways and Means Committee.  And according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, ""there has been no discussion of including major portions of this proposal by lawmakers."" Currently, individual estates worth up to $11.7 million (about $23.4 million for couples) are exempt from the estate tax. Any amount above that is subject to the tax, which tops out at 40%.  The bill being considered would apply the estate tax to more estates — those worth about $6 million or more (about $12 million for couples), with estates worth less than that paying no estate tax, said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.  That bill would apply to only a few thousand estates, Gleckman said.  The Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation did not estimate how many estates Biden’s proposal would have applied to. But the number would have been far more than a few thousand, Gleckman said. A viral image stated: ""Under part 2 of the infrastructure bill, upon death the entire value of your accumulated wealth and estate will be taxed at 61%."" The claim wrongly suggests that this is an active part of legislation that would be broadly applied to the entire value of all estates. Biden did propose two tax changes that, according to the Tax Foundation, would have created an effective 61% tax rate on an example estate of $100 million, including capital gains and estate taxes. The proposal was not in his infrastructure plan, but in a separate plan. It would have applied only to very large estates.  However, the proposals are not currently included in a budget reconciliation bill now being debated in Congress.

Most of the Afghan refugees at Fort McCoy are not special visa holders
","Wisconsin is again at the center of a historic refugee resettlement.  The federal government has placed some 12,500 Afghan refugees at Fort McCoy in the wake of the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan as the oppressive Taliban overran the country, sending many scrambling to leave. It’s the largest influx of displaced people to Wisconsin since the end of the Vietnam War, which led to resettlement of Hmong refugees here and across the U.S.  The U.S. will resettle about 65,000 Afghans this year, the bulk of which are housed already at eight different military installations in the country.  Since the refugees arrived, groups of state and federal lawmakers have visited Fort McCoy, Republicans and Democrats alike, with each side then offering a different picture of the resettlement -- and a different list of concerns.  After an Aug. 25, 2021 visit by Republican lawmakers, the focus was on who the refugees are, what we know about them, and whether they present a threat to the nation as they are resettled.
  ""I think one of the biggest takeaways for me was finding out the vast majority of the folks coming into Fort McCoy is that they are not the SIVs,"" said state Sen. Patrick Testin, R-Stevens Point, in an Aug. 29, 2021 appearance on WKOW-TV’s ""Capital City Sunday"".  ""There are other individuals who are at risk, or in some cases have no documentation at all, which is why it’s going to be critical that these individuals are vetted properly.""  SIV refers to ""special immigrant visas."" In this case, that generally refers to a status for Afghans who helped the U.S., often as translators, during its 20-year war in Afghanistan that began after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. It can also apply to their family members.  So, is Testin right that ""the vast majority of the (refugees) coming into Fort McCoy are not the SIVs"" and some have ""no documentation at all""?  To be sure, the exact number of refugees with and without special immigrant visa applications at Fort McCoy -- and how many have no documents at all -- has not been publicly released. When asked to provide backup for his claim, Testin referenced a private briefing that Major General Darrell Guthrie of the U.S. Army provided Republican lawmakers during their visit. However, he said he did not have any notes or documentation he could share from the meeting. While Testin aide Jeff Schultz said the information wasn’t classified, officials at the Department of Homeland Security and Fort McCoy declined to provide information about the proportion of SIV to non-SIV refugees at the base.  ""DHS does not confirm number of entries in any specific category,"" Cheryl Phillips, Fort McCoy’s director of public affairs, wrote in an email.  So, we reached out to several people who were at the briefing and know what was said. Scott Bolstad, a staff member to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, told us that base officials said Fort McCoy is being used primarily for refugees not in the Afghan SIV program.  Meanwhile, state Rep. Tony Kurtz, R-Wonewoc, provided a time-stamped copy of his personal notes from the meeting that indicated the same. What’s more, Testin’s claim also tracks with media reports -- including more recent ones, as the breakdown has become clearer. On Aug. 23, 2021, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported refugees at Fort McCoy included some people with SIV applications as well as green card holders and other types of refugees. No current special immigrant visa holders are at the base, the Journal Sentinel reported on Sept. 3.  But the SIV applicants are far from the only ones evacuated. In addition, the U.S. military also evacuated green card holders, green card applicants, student or business visa holders, refugees and people seeking temporary safety under what’s called humanitarian parole, according to an Aug. 25, 2021 PolitiFact guide on the vetting process for Afghan refugees.  Humanitarian parole allows temporary passage into the U.S. for people who would otherwise be ineligible for admission under typical refugee status.  Immigration officials can bypass the visa process and allow people into the country under this program at their discretion for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. Refugees admitted under parole are not granted permanent residency.  Finally, reports from when the U.S. was withdrawing from Afghanistan noted that officials evacuated an estimated 7,000 people who had assisted directly with the war effort. So, nearly every last one of those people would have to be at Fort McCoy for Testin’s claim to be wrong. Given all of that, it’s fair to say Testin is on track with the first part of his claim. But did some of the refugees arrive with ""no documentation at all""? That is the second part of Testin’s claim. To be sure, many Afghans arrived at the Kabul airport with no documentation amid the chaos of the country’s collapse. And, almost without a doubt, some of them wound up at Fort McCoy. But in making the claim, Testin suggests there was no vetting done of the refugees at all. It’s important to note, every person that boarded an evacuation flight was screened at an international staging area, such as Qatar or Germany, and screened again upon landing in the United States, CNN reported on Aug. 25, 2021. The vetting process, even without proper paperwork, included biographic information and biometric data, such as voiceprints, face photos, palm prints and iris scans. Afghans only arrived at military bases, such as Fort McCoy, after they passed through both initial screenings. And now here, they also face additional vetting and scrutiny before they are resettled in communities across the country -- or even allowed off the base. Testin said ""the vast majority of the (refugees) coming into Fort McCoy are not the SIVs"" and some have ""no documentation at all."" While no official numbers have been released, Testin’s comment was corroborated by two people who attended the briefing and tracks with what is known about the refugees in general and at Fort McCoy in particular: Most do not fall into the SIV category.  What’s more, in the chaos of the evacuation, it’s certain at least some have no documentation. That said, Testin’s overall point is undermined by the fact he ignores the vetting that did take place -- and will continue to take place before any refugees are resettled.  That fits our definition of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2021/oct/13/patrick-testin/most-afghan-refugees-fort-mccoy-are-not-special-vi/

A video posted this week on a Mitt Romney website (for the moment dedicated to Rick Perry) shows tumbleweeds blowing across an empty highway behind headlines indicating the Texas economy is sinking fast with Perry at the state’s helm.

The video, titled ""The Facts,"" trumpets these eye-catching claims: 
These claims are traced in Romney’s video to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Fair enough. Information from the agency, a reliable source for job-related calculations, earlier helped us confirm that 1.04 million Texans were unemployed as of August 2011, the latest month for which such data were available.

Also correct, per the bureau: The state’s August 2011 unemployment rate, 8.5 percent, was the highest Texas had experienced since the 9.3 percent rate reached in November 1986, nearly 25 years before.

Finally, the unemployment rate has doubled during Perry’s governorship -- going from 4.2 percent in December 2000 to 8.5 percent in August 2011.

However, we rated a previous Romney claim to this effect Half True. Experts reminded us that governors have little to do with statewide job losses or gains that take place during their terms.

Stephen Sweeney blames Chris Christie for rising poverty rate, health care coverage levels
","
While Gov. Chris Christie is focused on meeting with wealthy supporters, New Jersey’s economy is struggling, according to Senate President Stephen Sweeney.

Just as election season was getting under way, Sweeney offered two examples in a Sept. 15 message on Facebook of the state’s deteriorating economic conditions during Christie’s tenure: the poverty rate and the number of residents without health insurance has increased.

""New Jersey's poverty rate has increased since this governor took office and the number of New Jerseyans without health insurance has risen,"" Sweeney, a Democrat representing a southwestern part of the state, said in the message. ""It's time this governor does something about the economy, other than veto things because they weren't his idea.""

Sweeney’s numbers are accurate, but PolitiFact New Jersey determined the senator’s wrong to solely blame Christie for those economic woes.

First, let’s talk about the poverty rate and the number of residents without health insurance.

Chris Donnelly, a spokesman for Sweeney, directed us to a news article regarding data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey.

According to that data, the number of Garden State residents living in poverty increased from 9.3 percent to 10.7 percent between 2009 and 2010. The Current Population Survey also shows that the number of uninsured individuals grew to about 1.3 million in 2010 from roughly 1.2 million in 2009.

The bureau’s 2010 American Community Survey shows a similar pattern. According to the ACS, the number of New Jerseyans below the poverty level increased from 9.4 percent in 2009 to 10.3 percent in 2010.

So, the latest federal statistics prove Sweeney’s point that the poverty rate and the number of residents without health insurance have increased since Christie took office in January 2010.

But after reaching out to three poverty experts, we learned that while state policy can impact the level of poverty -- such as a decrease in the State Earned Income Tax Credit -- the main driving forces include the recession and the level of unemployment.

""Most of the factors that determine a state's poverty rate are beyond the control of a governor in the short run,"" Sheldon Danziger, director of the National Poverty Center at the University of Michigan, said in an email.

Pennsylvania State University professor John Iceland, who wrote the book ""Poverty in America,"" said understanding the current level of poverty must come with the realization that recovery is fairly slow after such a sharp and deep recession across the country.

Austin Nichols, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, also noted how child poverty rates have increased in the last decade mainly due to the faltering labor market.

Due in part to unemployment across the country, Nichols added: ""This whole country is in bad shape. I think some increase in poverty in unavoidable.""

But two changes during Christie’s tenure could lead to rising poverty -- the reduction in the number of public-sector employees and the cut to the State Earned Income Tax Credit, Nichols said. The State Earned Income Tax Credit, which is awarded to low- and moderate-income residents, was reduced from 25 to 20 percent of the federal benefit in 2010. 
It's worth noting that New Jersey has seen an increase of approximately 50,000 private-sector jobs since Christie entered office. 
Donnelly refuted that Sweeney’s Facebook message blames the governor for these economic conditions.

""The point was to convey that while things have gotten worse, the governor spent his time at fundraisers with the Koch brothers (GOP fundraisers Charles and David Koch) and not dealing with economic issues,"" Donnelly said in an email. ""Your interpretation, frankly, deserves a ‘Pants On Fire’ rating.""

However, we told Donnelly that the tone of the message and marking the time frame as ""since this governor took office"" indicate that Sweeney is blaming Christie.

Our ruling

In a Facebook message, Sweeney said that since Christie took office, New Jersey has seen increases in its poverty rate and the number of people without health insurance.

Those statistics are backed up by census data, but a state’s poverty rate is largely dependent on labor market conditions. We rate the statement Half True.

Michele Bachmann hits Obama administration for ending long-term care program
","
Michele Bachmann continued to make the case against the health care law supported by President Barack Obama and most Democrats during the Republican debate in Las Vegas on Oct. 18, 2011.

""Obamacare is so flat-out unpopular that even the Obama administration chose to reject part of Obamacare last Friday, when they tried to throw out the CLASS Act, which is the long-term care function,"" Bachmann said.

""Secretary (Kathleen) Sebelius, who is the head of Health and Human Services, reported that the government can't even afford that part and has to throw it out. And now the administration is arguing with itself,"" she added. ""When even the Obama administration wants to repeal this bill, I think we're going to win this thing. We're going to repeal it! And I will!""

Here, we’re fact-checking Bachmann’s statement, ""Obamacare is so flat-out unpopular, that even the Obama administration chose to reject part of Obamacare last Friday, when they tried to throw out the CLASS Act, which is the long-term care function.""

Bachmann gets a few things right here, but she also gives a misleading impression that the overall law’s popularity prompted the administration’s decision.

But first let’s start with what the CLASS Act does.

The problem the CLASS Act tries to address is how to pay for either nursing home care or in-home care for people who are functionally limited but do not require hospitalization. Right now, Medicare -- the health insurance program for Americans over age 65 -- usually does not pay for long-term nursing home care, and families can struggle to find appropriate help.

The acronym stands for Community Living Assistance Services and Supports, and it was created as part of the health care law. It was intended as a stand-alone government-run program to help defray the cost of long-term care. In some ways, the program was intended to act like a traditional insurance program -- the insured people pay premiums and then draw the benefits only if they need them. (If you have the appetite for it, read this detailed analysis on the differences between CLASS and traditional long-term care insurance.) The late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., championed the program for years, and it was through his efforts that the program was attached to the health care law.

But the CLASS program looks to have fizzled.

As Bachmann stated, on Oct. 14, 2011, U.S.Secretary of Health Human Services Kathleen Sebelius announced the program was not going forward, because it could not meet a legal requirement that the program be self-sustaining. (The insurance industry's term for this is ""actuarially sound."")

""For 19 months, experts inside and outside of government have examined how HHS might implement a financially sustainable, voluntary, and self-financed long-term care insurance program under the law that meets the needs of those seeking protection for the near term and those planning for the future,"" Sebelius wrote in a letter to Congress. ""The work has been groundbreaking in many ways and has taught us a great deal ... But despite our best analytical efforts, I do not see a viable path forward for CLASS implementation at this time.""

The problem that the program ran into was that people wouldn't join the program unless they were likely to need benefits, which meant costs would have exceeded contributions, said Richard Kaplan, an expert on elder law at the University of Illinois who has studied the CLASS program.

""This was only going to appeal to people who were extraordinarily risk averse or who were already ill,"" he said.

The requirement that the program pay for itself was actually an amendment put into the law by then-Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. Gregg is now an adviser to the investment bank Goldman Sachs, but he gave an interview on the end of the CLASS Act to the Washington Post's Sarah Kliff on Oct. 18.

""I didn’t like the idea of setting up the program. But with this, it was either going to have to work or come down as a result of the amendment,"" Gregg said.

As for the Obama administration ending the program, ""I don’t think they really had a choice in the matter,"" Gregg said.

And indeed, all the other sources we consulted indicated the administration had to stop the CLASS program because it could not meet its legal requirements. Bachmann is wrong when she suggests the Obama administration voluntarily ended the program in the face of negative public opinion about the overall health law.

Which brings us to another point -- the CLASS program is not an integral part of the health care law, as some might think upon hearing Bachmann's comments.

Most of the health care law has to do with expanding the coverage of traditional health care insurance. The CLASS program was intended to stand as a totally separate program only designed to help with long-term care.

Even if the CLASS program ends, the rest of the health care law still stands.

Even Gregg agreed this was the case, telling the Post, ""This was not a core element of the overall bill. It was put in as a courtesy to Sen. Kennedy. I do happen to think the overall bill is going to massively fail on the fiscal side and probably fail on the substantive side too. But you can separate off the CLASS Act as not having an effect on the underlying bill, even though the underlying bill will also fail.""

Finally, Bachmann said the Obama administration is ""arguing with itself"" about whether the CLASS Act should be formally repealed. Actually, the Obama administration has said that the law should be left on the books, calling a formal repeal unnecessary and unproductive. The law’s advocates say it should be left so it can be modified at some future time.

That position has drawn scorn from Republican leadership.

""It defies logic for the White House to admit this part of their health spending bill would put an unsustainable burden on taxpayers, yet demand it stay on the books,"" said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, in comments to the Associated Press.

 Our ruling

Bachmann said, ""Obamacare is so flat-out unpopular, that even the Obama administration chose to reject part of Obamacare last Friday, when they tried to throw out the CLASS Act, which is the long-term care function."" She's right that the Obama administration announced the program was ending. But the Obama administration is being forced to scuttle the program because it can't meet the cost requirements the law sets out. It's not because the administration's support is folding in the face of unpopularity. Bachmann messes up so many of the details as to significantly misrepresent the situation.

Michele Bachmann says four simultaneous military deployments is 'historic'
","
During the Oct. 18, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas, Michele Bachmann noted what she suggested was a landmark moment in American foreign policy.

""We saw the president of the United States engage American troops in a fourth conflict in a foreign land. This is historic.""

Currently, the U.S. has active military deployments of varying types in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and central Africa. The last mission -- which could involve boots on the ground in Uganda, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- was announced just days before the debate by President Barack Obama.

According to the White House, this latest mission involves ""approximately 100"" combat-equipped U.S. forces to aid ongoing efforts by African nations to counter a long-running battle with the Lord's Resistance Army, a guerilla group infamous for killing families and forcibly conscripting the remaining children as soldiers.

We wondered whether Bachmann was correct that four simultaneous U.S. deployments represented a significant landmark for the use of U.S. forces abroad. So we turned to a report compiled by the Congressional Research Service, ""Instances of Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad, 1798-2006.""

Because of the start and end date of the document’s data, we don’t have full information on deployments through 2011. But there are more than enough instances throughout recent U.S. history to demonstrate that four deployments is not a high-water mark.

We found a few periods prior to 1990 in which the number of separate overseas deployments came close to reaching four -- including 1899, 1912, 1916 and 1919 -- but in each case we took a more cautious path because we couldn’t be 100 percent sure that the specific dates for those deployments overlapped.

But beginning in 1993, we found that it was almost always the default that U.S. troops were actively deployed in at least four separate locations.

We won’t overwhelm you with a torrent of dates and locations. Instead, we’ll list two periods -- the 1990s and the 2000s -- each with one list of nations where the U.S. had long-term deployments and another list of nations where the U.S. briefly committed troops, such as for a rescue of diplomatic personnel or American civilians. For the 2000s, we’ll also add a special category of nations for which the U.S. disclosed that it had dispatched troops for training and preparation for post-9/11 antiterrorism training and other operations.

Long deployments, 1993-2000

Bosnia / Macedonia
East Timor
Former Yugoslavia / Kosovo
Haiti
Iraq no-fly zone 
Short deployments, 1993-2000

Afghanistan (airstrike only)
Albania
Burundi
Central African Republic
Kenya
Liberia
Sierra Leone
Somalia
Sudan (airstrike only)
Tanzania
Yemen

Long deployments, 2001-06

Cote D’Ivoire
East Timor
Haiti
Lebanon
Liberia

 Global War on Terror deployments, 2001-06

Djibouti
Eritrea
Ethiopia
Georgia
Kenya
Phillipines
Yemen

According to our count, from 1993 to 2006, the number of simultaneous deployments dropped below four only for one year -- 1997. Otherwise, the U.S. was juggling at least four and sometimes eight or nine deployments at once.

Not all of these previous deployments were equal in scope. Some lasted years and involved ground troops; some lasted just a few days; some were primarily based on air power. But that's also true today. Afghanistan and Iraq are years-long operations with ground forces, while Libya has been a NATO operation in which the U.S. did not have large numbers of troops on the ground. The mission against the Lord’s Resistance Army, meanwhile, looks like some of the smaller operations from the past two decades.

To make sure we weren’t missing context, we asked military historians whether they thought our analysis was sound. The two who responded -- Ted Wilson, a history professor at the University of Kansas, and William W. Stueck, a historian at the University of Georgia -- agreed that Bachmann was wrong to suggest that four simultaneous deployments represented any kind of landmark.

Our ruling

A look through history suggests that, contrary to Bachmann’s claim, having four simultaneous military deployments is not only not a landmark, it’s actually become the norm for the U.S. since 1993.

Mitt Romney hits Rick Perry, saying 40 percent of Texas job growth went to illegal immigrants
","
During the Oct. 18, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas, Mitt Romney sought to undermine Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s argument that he’s presided over rapid job creation during his tenure.

""If you look over the last several years, 40 percent, almost half the jobs created in Texas, were created for illegal aliens, illegal immigrants,"" Romney said.

Romney was referring to a study titled, ""Who Benefited from Job Growth In Texas? A Look at Employment Gains for Immigrants and the Native-Born, 2007 to 2011,"" published by the Center for Immigration Studies, a research group that supports reducing illegal immigration.

The report analyzed U.S. Census Bureau data and found that immigrants, both legal and illegal, ""have been the primary beneficiaries"" of job growth in Texas since 2007, even though native-born workers accounted for 69 percent of the growth in the state’s working-age population over the same period.

Specifically, the report said that, of the jobs created in Texas since 2007, 81 percent were taken by newly arrived immigrant workers, both legal and illegal. In the meantime, the group estimated that about half of the newly arrived immigrants who took jobs in Texas beginning in 2007 were illegal.

As a result, the report estimated that about 40 percent of job growth in Texas since 2007 went to newly arrived illegal immigrants.

So Romney’s comment described the results of the study pretty faithfully, though it would have been more accurate if he’d referred to jobs ""given to illegal aliens,"" rather than ""created for illegal aliens."" The study doesn’t suggest that Texas employers were conspiring to create jobs specifically for illegal immigrants, only that illegal immigrants ended up filling them.

However, we see two additional issues that call into question the accuracy of the study itself:

The 40 percent figure uses gross numbers of immigrants rather than net numbers.

The report actually offered calculations using two sets of numbers -- one using the total number of immigrants coming into the state, and the other using that number minus the number of immigrant departures and deaths. Using the net immigrant figure -- the one Romney didn’t use -- results in a lower percentage.

The figure using net immigration is about 54 percent. And once you divide that by two to estimate the share for illegal immigrants, the relevant number is about 27 percent, not 40 percent.

So Romney has effectively cherry-picked the higher of two percentages offered in the report.

Both the 40 percent figure and the 27 percent figure are subject to a wide margin of error.

Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center, an independent research organization, said that ""there are lots of methodological problems with the CIS study, mainly having to do with the limitations of small sample sizes and the fact that the estimates are determined by taking differences of differences based on small sample sizes."" In addition, the assumption that 50 percent of immigrants are illegal is an educated guess, but still a guess.

Meanwhile, the Census data used in the report is a longitudinal survey, which means that Census employees check back periodically with the same participants. ""How many undocumented folks do you honestly think would be participating in that?"" asks Sarah Jane Glynn, a policy analyst with the liberal Center for American Progress.

Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, added that the report did not drill deeper into the data than ""working age.""

""Even within the working-age population, it might be the case that the immigrant population may have disproportionately grown in age groups -- say, ages 25-49 -- where employment rates are highest,"" he said. ""A really sophisticated analysis might show that, given the age distribution of net immigrant population growth and net native population growth, immigrants got exactly the proportion of new jobs a good forecaster would predict."" Given the data, though, we ""just don’t know,"" he said.

The report does acknowledge that ""no estimate of illegal immigration is exact."" But the methodological shortcomings also weaken the certainty of Romney’s statistic.

On balance, we think that both the report’s authors and its critics have reasonable points.

In the big picture, we agree with Chuck DeVore -- a conservative critic of the study -- that ""trying to draw conclusions about immigration and employment in Texas in isolation from other factors is problematic at best.""

But we also agree with Mark Krikorian, the Center for Immigration Studies’ executive director, that ""even if DeVore prefers a net-to-net comparison, immigrants still got a disproportionate share of new jobs.""

Our ruling

In the debate, Romney cited the report’s headline figure pretty accurately. But he failed to note, first, that it was an estimate subject to significant uncertainty, and second, that the report itself included an alternative -- and arguably more accurate -- measurement that produced a significantly lower figure.

That said, the lower figure, even when adjusted for uncertainty, still backs up Romney’s underlying point that illegal immigrants have gained a disproportionate share of new jobs in Texas. It’s just that the number probably isn’t as high as Romney said in the debate.

Rep. Matt Gaetz says ethanol study shows it's not worth the energy
","
Florida's ethanol mandate has been in place less than a year, and a Panhandle Republican plans to push for its repeal.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, who lives in the coastal community of Fort Walton Beach, argues corn-based fuel takes more energy to make than it generates.

""A Cornell University research study concludes that ethanol generates a 29 percent energy loss, meaning it takes more than a gallon of gasoline to produce a gallon of ethanol,"" he wrote in a recent Pensacola News Journal op-ed.

A PolitiFact Florida reader sent a link our way. We were curious: Has an Ivy League researcher found ethanol to be an energy loser?

We were especially curious because the U.S. Department of Energy says the majority of such studies about ethanol's ""net energy balance,"" especially more recent ones, show the opposite. So, of course, does the renewable fuels industry. 

First, a little background. The Florida law, passed in 2008, has required since Dec. 31, 2010, that most gasoline include 9 percent to 10 percent ""agriculturally derived"" fuel. Lawmakers said they wanted to boost renewable energy that would cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce reliance on foreign oil. 

But boaters in Gaetz's district were ready to ""get out the pitchforks,"" he said. The law doesn't apply to gas sold for small engines or boats. Still, some boaters who used the mix, known as E10, found it would rot out fuel lines and gunk up carburetors. Gaetz, propelled by angry constituents, did some research — and now has a file in his Tallahassee office to support legislation to turn back the mandate. He sent us a news release from Cornell News Service, ""Cornell ecologist's study finds that producing ethanol and biodiesel from corn and other crops is not worth the energy.""

That appears to give Gaetz's claim strong roots.

So does the study itself, which said ""to produce a liter of (corn) ethanol requires 29 percent more fossil energy than is produced as ethanol."" Researchers included all kinds of ""energy inputs"" required to produce fuel from corn — more than a dozen just to grow the corn in the first place, from production of pesticides and nitrogen fertilizer to construction of farm equipment to food for farmworkers. (The authors argue that government and industry studies don't take enough ""energy inputs"" into account, which is why they get a different result.) All the fossil energy, from natural gas to liquid fuel to coal, got totaled up and explained as ""gasoline equivalents.""

That's a little more nuanced than Gaetz's claim that a study said it takes ""gasoline"" to produce ethanol. But it's close.

Still, the study was from 2005. Did Gaetz quote an outdated statistic to make his point?

We chatted with one of the researchers, David Pimentel, an emeritus professor in agriculture and life sciences at Cornell. We read him Gaetz's claim. 
""Yeah, that's correct,"" Pimentel said. ""We have more up-to-date data, though. ...

""It would be 1.5 gallons of gasoline equivalents to produce 1 gallon of ethanol. So this is even worse.""

In other words, Gaetz cited an old number. But more recent work from the same researchers would have even better demonstrated his point. That's scarcely statistical malfeasance.

What about the fact that Pimentel's research flies in the face of government and industry studies? We would have preferred Gaetz note that in his op-ed, but Pimentel's a widely cited biofuel skeptic whose work is addressed by USDA researchers and weighed by other Ivy League energy experts. That makes Pimentel's work the subject of legitimate discussion. 
This fact-check doesn't attempt to evaluate the science itself, but whether Gaetz accurately characterized a scientific study when he wrote, ""a Cornell University research study concludes that ethanol generates a 29 percent energy loss, meaning it takes more than a gallon of gasoline to produce a gallon of ethanol.""

We found the study and talked with the Cornell researcher, who said Gaetz accurately cited him. Still, we're concerned readers might think it literally takes gasoline — rather than gasoline ""equivalents"" — to produce ethanol. Meanwhile, with the Ivy League appeal of Gaetz's statistic, it might appear to represent settled scientific consensus. In fact, researchers battle from paper to paper — and Pimentel's in the minority. So, the op-ed claim was accurate, but needs some clarification. That's our definition of Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2011/oct/19/matt-gaetz/rep-matt-gaetz-says-ethanol-study-shows-its-not-wo/
"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Mark Miller']","
Miller says nearly 14,000 Wisconsinites have lost their job since Governor Walker and the Republicans took over in January
","
In September 2011, Gov. Scott Walker responded to disappointing employment numbers by calling lawmakers back to Madison for the second special session on jobs in the nine months since he took office.

The Sept. 28, 2011 announcement  came after the Department of Workforce Development reported Sept. 15, 2011 that the state lost 800 jobs in August. That was on top of a loss of 10,800 jobs reported for the month before.

Promising a bipartisan effort, Walker urged lawmakers to pass some 30 bills by November.

But opponents said the session on jobs was little more than political posturing.

State Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller (D-Monona) joined the criticism, issuing a Sept. 28, 2011 news release that said: ""Nearly 14,000 Wisconsinites have lost their job since Governor Walker and the Republicans took over in January. In that time we’ve seen precious little action from Republicans to put people back to work.""

We’ve been tracking progress toward Walker’s promise of 250,000 new jobs in his four-year term, and remembered lots of upbeat numbers early on. (You can find the latest update on the Walk-O-Meter here).

Have 14,000 people really lost their jobs?

When asked for backup, Miller aide Michael Browne referred us to the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports on employment. Browne said Miller was not available for an interview on the subject. The bureau’s data shows that 239,916 Wisconsin residents were without a job in August, 2011, compared with 225,983 in January, when Walker took office.

The difference: 13,933.

Browne said that was the number of people who have lost work since Walker took office.

But is that what the number means?

We asked Andrew Feldman, director of BadgerStat, a nonpartisan nonprofit that provides online performance measures of Wisconsin to citizens and policy makers, for his take.

""Sen. Miller is right that the number of unemployed people in Wisconsin has increased by about 14,000 people since Governor Walker took office,"" he said. ""What we can't say for sure is what portion of those roughly 14,000 people became unemployed because they lost their jobs.""

Confused? Welcome to the world of counting jobs and the unemployed.

The bureau defines ""unemployed"" as people who are out of work but looking for a job.  (They’re counted). But some people are out of work and have given up looking. (They’re not counted.) And then there are folks who are out of work, gave up looking, but have now decided that they want to look for work again. (They are counted.)

""Both factors are likely at play here in Wisconsin,"" Feldman said. ""Some people have lost jobs during 2011 while others re-entered the labor market and started looking for work again.""

So, Miller would be off by ascribing the entire increase to folks losing jobs.

We asked the feds what their numbers mean.

They also said Miller is off in his interpretation

""BLS unemployment data are not gathered from the number of unemployment claims,"" said agency spokeswoman Stacey Standish.""BLS uses a monthly household survey to calculate labor force data. The unemployed are those that respond that they do not have a job, would like a job, are actively looking for a job, and are available to work.""

Standish said the figure means there were 13,933 more people unemployed -- by their measure -- in August compared to beginning of the year.

Let’s return to that jobs promise by Walker.

It covers the other side of the coin from unemployment, and offers some perspective on how the numbers can be used -- or misused.

The most recent state report said that in August the state lost 800 jobs. However, there has been an overall  increase of 29,600 jobs since Walker took office. That leaves 220,400 jobs remaining for Walker to reach his goal.

That is, the net number is what gets measured, not individual increases or decreases.

For instance, the August report says total private sector employment was down 800 jobs. The construction industry was down 3,000 jobs and the information sector was down 1,100 jobs for that month. Yet there were 800 jobs added in educational and health services and 2,000 in leisure and hospitality. For that month, the number of lost jobs outnumbered the number of jobs gained by 800.

In other words: it wasn’t 800 people who lost their job. It might have been more or less than that.

Consider what would happen if you applied the same approach Miller is using on the unemployment side of the ledger to the jobs side of it. State reports say there has been an increase in state employment for six separate months. If you added those months together, the total is 41,200 jobs. No one is claiming that many people found jobs.

The difference -- the net -- is a better reflection of where the state is at. That sum, right now,  is plus-29,600.

Experts and others who analyze the monthly data emphasize the numbers are estimates based on surveys, and useful as yardsticks of employment conditions. But they are simply estimates, not a measure of what happened to individual employees.

Our conclusion

Miller says 14,000 state residents lost their job since Walker took office, citing federal numbers as evidence. But those who gather the numbers say they can’t be used in the manner Miller is using them.

(It’s similar to an earlier fact-check, where Republicans were comparing the state job-growth numbers to the national ones.)

Miller has the right number for the increase of unemployed people. But it’s impossible to know how many lost their jobs this year vs. those who lost their jobs earlier and are now starting to look again.

"['Georgia', 'Environment', 'Hank Johnson']","
Going green helps bring in green, congressman says
","
A recent environmental flare-up in Congress drew the ire of one Georgia representative and an opportunity to dust off the Truth-O-Meter.

U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson recently used his website to voice his outrage about a bill called the TRAIN Act.

The bill passed the House of Representatives in late September with strong support by Republicans who said the act is needed to examine Obama administration environmental policies they say have resulted in higher oil, gas and coal prices. The bill, as of late last week, was in the U.S. Senate’s Committee on Environment and Public Works.

Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat, said the bill would block ""two of the most important, life-saving Clean Air rules in decades -- the mercury and air toxics rule and cross-state air pollution rule.""

The congressman then argued it’s false to claim strong environmental regulations hurt big business and used some numbers to back up his case.

""Since 1970, the Clean Air Act has reduced toxic and health-threatening air pollution by 60 percent while our economy has grown more than 200 percent,"" Johnson said.

So are Johnson’s numbers correct?

The congressman’s office said the information we wanted to check came from the American Lung Association. A spokesman for the association referred us to an Environmental Protection Agency report last year that found emissions for six common pollutants had declined by 63 percent since 1970. The EPA report also found the nation’s gross domestic product has increased by 204 percent in that same time frame.

Several experts we spoke with said the EPA’s numbers were on target and had no quarrels with the federal agency’s research.

""I think [Johnson] is on point,"" said Lynn Goldman, dean of the George Washington University School of Health Services.

On the economic growth part of the claim, two local economics experts we interviewed thought that number was on target, too. They both looked at GDP data that was adjusted for inflation. Christine Ries, who teaches economics at Georgia Tech, said gross domestic product is the measure most commonly used to measure economic growth.

Georgia State University economics department chairwoman Sally Wallace also found no problem with the math in Johnson’s statement. She did suggest we look at per capita income to examine the second part of the congressman’s claim. The growth in that category was also above 200 percent, from $19,167 in 1970 to the 2010 per capita income of $40,584.

Johnson’s statement seems to imply that the Clean Air Act did not hurt the economy or even helped it. Wallace wasn’t sure a direct correlation can be made.

She researched GDP 10 years before the Clean Air Act passed and the 40 years since and concluded that the average annual growth was greater before 1970. ""It’s kind of difficult to say it’s directly related,"" Wallace told us.

Two groups joined forces last year to research the economic impact of the Clean Air Act. The Small Business Majority, an advocacy group for the nation’s 28 million small businesses, and the Main Street Alliance, a national coalition of small business networks in 15 states, concluded in its 10-page report that about 1.3 million jobs were created between 1977 and 1991 as a result of environmental regulations from the Clean Air Act. Using some EPA data, they believe the Clean Air Act’s benefits far outweighed the costs. The report criticized congressional efforts to scale back the EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act.

For years, as a 2001 paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research noted, manufacturers have argued whether the act puts them at a competitive disadvantage globally. The report by the widely cited think tank looked at 15 years of data and concluded that the regulations ""retard industrial activity.""

Johnson is correct in his statement about the Clean Air Act’s impact on pollution. The rest of his argument was aimed at countering claims that strong environmental policies hurt business. The numbers the congressman used seem to be on target, but there’s some room for debate about the Clean Air Act’s impact on the economy.

Dave Yost says SB 5 would save Columbus $41M a year in pension costs
","
People on both sides of Senate Bill 5, the controversial overhaul of Ohio’s collective-bargaining law, are fond of general statements that amplify their positions but are hard to quantify.

SB 5, supporters say, will save public dollars. But, opponents warn, it will threaten public safety.

Rare is the specific number in this polarizing debate. So Ohio Auditor Dave Yost triggered PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity this month when he penned a guest column for The Plain Dealer.

Yost, a Republican, wrote in favor of Issue 2, this fall’s ballot referendum on SB 5. A ""yes"" vote would uphold the GOP-backed law. A ""no"" vote would repeal the changes.

In building his case, Yost noted that SB 5 would require government employees to contribute at least 10 percent of their salaries toward their pensions. The new rules ban ""pension pickups"" -- a perk in some contracts that calls for the public employer to cover a portion of those costs.

Under SB 5, Yost argued, ""the city of Columbus would save $41 million a year if employees had to contribute to their own, guaranteed-check pensions. That’s 500 cops and firefighters.""

The dollar amount is what caught PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. How Columbus might use the money is purely speculative. We wanted to know if such savings would even exist, especially since more general statements are sometimes made without taking into consideration the fact that many public employees already are contributing significantly toward their pensions.

Yost did not cite the source of his $41 million figure in the column. So we dialed up his assistant public affairs director and press secretary, Carrie Bartunek.

She referred us to story The Columbus Dispatch published March 6, several weeks before state legislators and Gov. John Kasich approved a final version of the plan. That story showed results of The Dispatch’s analysis on the impact of SB 5. Based on a survey, reporters concluded that, had SB 5 been in effect, central Ohio’s largest government entities would together have saved a $74 million in 2010.

Columbus accounted for the biggest chunk in The Dispatch analysis: $50 million. What’s more: ""The newspaper’s survey found that most of Columbus’ annual savings -- $41.2 million -- would come from ending the city’s practice of paying much of the employees’ share for pensions.""

Yost appeared to be right on the nose. But as much as we love it when public officials have faith in what they read in daily newspapers, PolitiFact Ohio decided to double-check The Dispatch’s numbers. That led us to Columbus Mayor Michael Coleman,  a Democrat and a fiery opponent of SB 5. Would The Dispatch’s figures hold up under his scrutiny?

The $41 million ""was accurate at the time the article was published (in March 2011),"" Coleman spokesman Dan Williamson said. ""We currently have $36.5 million budgeted for the pickup in 2011.""

Columbus picks up a portion of employee pension contributions under contracts with six unions. Topping the list are workers represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. They receive a 9 percent pickup, according to numbers Williamson shared. Workers in three other unions get an 8 percent pickup, one union gets 6.5 percent and another 5.5 percent.

So what explains the year-over-year decrease in funds budgeted for pension pickups? 

""In 2009, Mayor Coleman initiated a 10-year reform plan to gradually increase the amount employees pay into their health care and pensions,"" Williamson explained via email.

Bartunek said Yost used the most recent numbers to convey his point. ""We’re talking in real time,"" she told PolitiFact Ohio. ""People know that number won’t be the same in five years.""

Her point is not an invalid one. Contracts are subject to change and expiration, and if Columbus officials can’t negotiate terms more favorable to city coffers, Coleman’s downward projections might not hold. Coleman acknowledges in his 2011 budget that there are assumptions made based on the city’s goals.

But whether it’s $41 million, $36.5 million or some other figure, an annual pension pickup savings of $41 million is obviously no lock for Columbus taxpayers.

Yost understood such caveats, ""but when you’re writing a 500-word column, you’re not going to put all those pieces in,"" Bartunek said. ""There would have to be a lot of qualifiers.""

So what does that mean for Yost’s claim?

His statement is accurate. Columbus would have saved about $41 million had SB 5 been the law in 2010. 

But for PolitiFact, words matter. 

Yost’s description was that the city would save $41 million annually. Yost would have been more precise, and only slightly less compelling, had he simply noted that Columbus would have saved $41 million last year. That, in fact, is how The Dispatch referred to the savings.

And readers also would have been fully informed had he acknowledged Coleman’s efforts to reduce pickups; Yost’s implication was that without SB 5, the savings would not materialize otherwise. 

Those are needed points of clarification and additional information.

Property taxes at Newark's Prudential Center become issue in Bergen County Senate race
","
The Prudential Center in Newark is not in his legislative district or even one of the counties he's looking to represent in Trenton, but Republican State Senate candidate John Driscoll Jr. wants voters in parts of Bergen and Passaic counties to know the arena doesn’t pay property taxes.

For that exemption, Driscoll says voters can blame his opponent in the Nov. 8 general election, Democratic incumbent Robert Gordon. 
Looking to unseat Gordon in the 38th Legislative District, Driscoll, a Bergen County freeholder, recently put out a television ad lambasting the senator for allegedly raising taxes and chasing away jobs from Bergen County.

With cash flying from the image of a family superimposed over a photo of the Prudential Center, the narrator intones: ""Gordon cost us money, exempting the Newark sports arena from paying property taxes and sticking us with the bill.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Gordon did vote in 2008 to exempt the Newark Housing Authority, which owns the arena, from paying property taxes there. But that property tax exemption did not have a direct effect on voters in Bergen and Passaic counties, who are the target audience for the ad.

First, let’s explain the property tax exemption.

Gordon was one of 21 senators -- the minimum needed for passage -- to vote for a bill in 2008 exempting projects like the Prudential Center from paying property taxes. The bill was later signed into law by former Gov. Jon Corzine.

Without such an exemption, the authority would have had to pay $6 million in property taxes to the city, authority attorney Paul Sangillo said at the time.

So, Driscoll’s ad is right that Gordon supported an exemption for the Prudential Center, which means the city does not receive property tax revenues from the arena property. Otherwise, those tax revenues would go to the city, its school district and Essex County.

In a statement, Newark spokeswoman Anne Torres said the tax exemption is appropriate, because the arena property is publicly owned. The authority collects rent at the arena on behalf of the city, Torres said.

""If the property were not exempt, the NHA would likely have to expend federal or state funding or in other words ‘tax dollars’ to afford the taxes on the property,"" according to the statement. ""Without revisiting the original ownership structure, the exemption from that view potentially saved tax dollars.""

Former New Jersey Deputy Attorney General Robert Blau, who has an extensive background in real estate matters, also noted the impact of other tax revenue, such as sales taxes: ""There are certainly other taxes that Newark gets because of the existence of the center. It’s not just lost property taxes.""

OK, so Newark is not receiving property taxes from the arena property, but the ad claims the exemption ""cost us money."" Who is ""us?""

Driscoll spokesman Greg Volpe said ""us"" refers to taxpayers, and pointed to news articles showing that Newark has needed additional state aid both before and after that exemption was granted.

""The special exemption for (the) Newark Arena cost the city's bottom line millions of dollars in recurring revenue,"" Volpe said in an email. ""State Legislators were wrong to exempt one of Newark's revenue assets and the result is state taxpayers, including those in the 38th District, have continued to pick up the bill.""

But the ad doesn’t mention those additional state aid awards, giving viewers the impression that ""bill"" refers to the property tax exemption alone. The absence of those property tax payments only has a direct impact on Newark, its school district and Essex County.

""I’m not aware of any rationale by which it could be said that a Newark local property tax exemption could be said to impact taxpayers outside of Essex County,"" Joseph Ragno, an attorney with extensive experience in tax abatements, said in an email.

Our ruling

In a TV ad, Driscoll claims Gordon cost taxpayers money by ""exempting the Newark sports arena from paying property taxes and sticking us with the bill."" Gordon did support that exemption, and news articles show that Newark has needed additional state aid dollars over the years.

But the ad ties the ""bill"" to the property tax exemption, and the only entities directly affected are the city, the school district and the county -- not those voters in Bergen and Passaic counties.

Herman Cain says the 9-9-9 plan does not raise taxes on those making the least
","
Herman Cain has offered what he calls a simple tax plan to take the place of the current tax code, which he says is too complicated. Cain, a Republican candidate for president, touts a 9-9-9 plan: a 9 percent income tax, a 9 percent sales tax and a 9 percent business tax.

Cain’s plan has gotten more attention in recent days -- and more criticism.

At the debate for the Republican nomination in Las Vegas on Oct. 18, 2011, moderator Anderson Cooper of CNN summarized those concerns. ""Mr. Cain, a lot of prominent conservatives now are coming forward saying that your 9-9-9 plan would actually raise taxes on middle-class voters, on lower-income voters,"" Cooper said.

""The thing that I would encourage people to do before they engage in this knee-jerk reaction is read our analysis. It is available at HerrmanCain.com,"" Cain said. ""It was performed by Fiscal Associates. And all of the claims that are made against it, it is a jobs plan, it is revenue-neutral, it does not raise taxes on those that are making the least. All of those are simply not true.""

Here, we wanted to check Cain’s answer to Cooper’s question, that the plan ""does not raise taxes on those that are making the least.""

We’ve been looking at Cain’s plan as part of our ongoing work fact-checking the Republican nomination contest. Based on what Cain and his campaign have said about the plan, the only exemptions on the income tax will be for charitable deductions and for undefined ""empowerment"" zones that would encourage development in inner cities. The 9 percent sales tax would apply to all new goods but not to used goods. Payroll taxes on workers would go away. 

If you pay no income tax currently -- and about half the country doesn’t -- Cain’s plan means you would pay more income tax.  

The day of the debate, a new analysis was published examining Cain’s tax plan. The analysis was published by the Tax Policy Center, an independent policy analysis group that includes tax analysts who have worked in both Democratic and Republican administrations.

The Tax Policy Center analyzed Cain’s plan using the same type of models it has used to examine other national tax proposals.

The analysis found that Cain’s tax plan would result in tax cuts for many of the wealthiest tax payers and tax increases for the poorest tax payers.

The center found that 83.8 percent of tax filers would get a tax increase under Cain’s plan, compared with current tax policy.

On the other hand, most of the tax filers who make more than $1 million would get a tax cut under the Cain plan, about 95.4 percent of this high income group. And the average tax cut for millionaires would be $487,300.

The center also offered analysis of Cain’s plan by income level compared with current tax policy. Most people earning lower incomes would see a tax increase.
  
We should note that the Tax Policy Center said it had to make a few assumptions about Cain’s plan in order to analyze the plan according to its standard economic model. So it’s possible Cain may release more details that could cause these estimates to change. 
Cain said the 9-9-9 plan ""does not raise taxes on those that are making the least."" But it would raise income taxes on  people who now have low tax burdens due to exemptions and deductions. The Tax Policy Center analysis adds more detail and found that high percentages of lower-income tax filers would see tax increases. It’s true that Cain’s campaign may release more details on his plan that could change this picture.

Illegal immigrants did lawn care for Mitt Romney
","
Mitt Romney’s hiring decisions in lawn care continue to dog him.

The former Massachusetts governor, in an Oct. 18, 2011, Republican presidential debate, faced accusations from primary foe Rick Perry that he hired illegal immigrants to work at his home.

The two had this tense exchange:

Perry: ""Mitt, you lose all of your standing, from my perspective, because you hired illegals in your home and you knew about it for a year. And the idea that you stand here before us and talk about that you're strong on immigration is on its face the height of hypocrisy.""

Moderator Anderson Cooper: ""Gov. Romney?""

Romney: ""Rick, I don't think I've ever hired an illegal in my life. And so I'm afraid -- I'm looking forward to finding your facts on that, because that just doesn't --""

Then they proceeded to talk over each other, but Romney's claim was virtually the same as one we've checked before.

The first time Romney was running for president, in 2006, the Boston Globe broke a story about his hired help.

The Globe said Romney, for an entire decade, used a landscaping company that relied on illegal Guatemalan immigrants. Employees at the company, Community Lawn Service with a Heart, said its owner hadn't asked them to provide documents showing their immigration status. 
The workers said they were paid $9 to $10 an hour, in cash, for working sometimes 11 hours a day.

The newspaper sent a team of reporters to Guatemala after getting a tip that Romney had hired a landscaping company notorious for using illegal immigrants. They tracked down three former landscapers who claimed to have been in the United States illegally when they worked on Romney's lawn.

One of them, Rene Alvarez Rosales, said he worked for Romney eight years landscaping his lawn, occasionally getting a ""buenos dias"" from Romney himself. Others told the Globe of casual encounters with Romney over the years, during which he had never inquired about their status.

Romney’s first response to reporters’ questions about the matter: ""Aw, geez.""

Later, his campaign issued a statement that the governor knew nothing about the immigration status of the landscaping workers, and that his dealings were with owner of the company, a legal immigrant from Colombia. The owner told the Globe that Romney never asked him about the status of the workers.

When the Los Angeles Times followed up with another story, a Romney spokesman said, ""Gov. Romney has no information or knowledge to corroborate the Globe's allegations. He hired a legitimate lawn service company and he knows the owner as a decent, hardworking person who is a legal resident.""

When Romney said he ""did not"" have illegal immigrants working for him, we rated his statement Mostly False, given the credible evidence that undocumented lawn care laborers from Guatemala worked at his home for years, and his careful statements about his knowledge of their status.

Michele Bachmann says top income tax rate rose from 7 percent in 1913 to 70 percent in 1980
","
During the Oct. 18, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., said, ""When we got the income tax in 1913, the top rate was 7 percent. By 1980, the top rate was 70 percent."" 
Is she correct? 
We turned to the website of the Tax Foundation, which has a document that lists every tax bracket since the imposition of the federal income tax in 1913. 
It turns out Bachmann is right. 
In 1913, the federal tax code levied income taxes ranging from 1 percent to 7 percent, with the top rate of 7 percent levied on incomes of $500,000 and above (or the current equivalent of $11,332,304). At that time, there were no distinctions in filing status, such as individuals or married filing jointly. 
By 1980 -- just before Ronald Reagan ascended to the presidency -- the top rate was 70 percent for all filing categories. The top rate kicked in at $108,300 for individuals and $215,400 for married couples filing jointly, or $294,907 and $586,546, respectively, in today’s money. 
For comparison’s sake, the top rate today for all categories is 35 percent. And the top rate was actually higher before the 1980 level of 70 percent that Bachmann cited. For every year between1944 to 1963, the top tax rate exceeded 90 percent. 
Our ruling 
Bachmann has accurately presented the historical tax rates for the two years she cited. We rate her statement True. ",/factchecks/2011/oct/19/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-top-income-tax-rate-rose-7-p/

Rick Santorum has it wrong on Mitt Romney's book
","
Even though it’s printed in black and white, Mitt Romney keeps getting challenged on just what he said in his book.

In a Republican presidential debate on Oct. 11, 2011, Texas Gov. Rick Perry attacked Romney saying that in his book No Apology, Romney called the Massachusetts health care reform he enacted a model for the nation and said that he deleted the passage from the paperback version.

During an Oct. 18 debate in Las Vegas, it was Rick Santorum on the attack.

""It was in your book that it should be for everybody,"" the former Pennsylvania senator told Romney. ""You took it out of your book,"" he added.

Thus ensued a feisty back-and-forth between Santorum and Romney, who has repeatedly denied the charge, insisting he has never asserted that Massachusetts’ program should be taken to a nationwide level.

PolitiFact has checked this charge before.

Perry’s accusation arose from the difference between the first, hardcover edition of Romney’s book and the later paperback version. ""As a matter of fact, between books, your hard copy book, you said it was exactly what the American people needed, to have that Romneycare given to them as you had in Massachusetts. Then in your paperback, you took that line out.""

Here’s the text of each edition:

HARDCOVER: ""We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country, and it can be done without letting government take over health care.""

To:

PAPERBACK: ""And it was done without government taking over health care."" 
So why the change? 
The health care debate took a dramatic turn between the publication of the two editions of No Apology. His hardcover was written when the national health care policy supported by President Barack Obama included a public insurance option. So Romney's Massachusetts plan, by comparison, kept ""private insurance and personal choice intact,"" he wrote. 
Then the Democratic plan passed without the public option, and it very closely resembled Romney's plan. Both left in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. They both aimed to reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and offering tax breaks to help moderate income people buy insurance. And both included a requirement to buy insurance or else face a penalty, a provision called the individual mandate.

Suddenly, the line in the hardcover edition to ""accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country"" as Republican Romney had done for Massachusetts was uncomfortably close to what the Democratic president had done nationally. Hence the change to the more declarative, ""it was done without government taking over health care.""

So Perry was right that the words in Romney's book and even the meaning changed somewhat between editions. But he mischaracterized Romney’s words. When PoliltiFact looked at the section of the hardback from which the quote came, we found that Romney was not really saying ""it was exactly what the American people needed, to have that Romneycare given to them."" He was in fact presenting a defense of state-level choice — not a pitch for a mandatory national approach.  We rated Perry's comment Mostly False.

Now Santorum has said, ""It was in your book that it should be for everybody,"" and added that Romney took the assertion out in a later edition. That’s an exaggeration. We rate his statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/oct/19/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-has-it-wrong-mitt-romneys-book/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says illegal immigrant population rose 60 percent, while California, Florida were steady
","
During the Oct. 18, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney sparred with one of his rivals, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, over immigration. 
Over the last 10 years, Romney said, California and Florida have had ""no increase in illegal immigration. Texas has had 60 percent increase in illegal immigrants.... If there's someone who has a record as governor with regards to illegal immigration that doesn't stand up to muster, it's you, not me."" 
We’ll start our analysis by noting that counting illegal immigrants is a notoriously tricky task. The U.S. Census Bureau doesn’t ask for the legal status of the people it interviews, so independent groups need to approximate the numbers of foreign-born individuals who are believed to be unauthorized, based on factors such as gender, age, country of origin and year of entry into the U.S. 
According to experts we contacted, there are two sources that produce credible estimates: the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Immigration Statistics and the Pew Hispanic Center. Both of these organizations have produced numbers that are broadly similar to Romney’s claim. 
First, the numbers for Texas. The DHS estimated that Texas had 1,090,000 unauthorized immigrants in 2000, rising to an estimated 1,770,000 by 2010 -- an increase of 680,000, or about 62 percent, over the decade. 
Meanwhile, Pew estimated the numbers to be 1,100,000 in 2000 and 1,650,000 in 2010 (the midpoint of a range between 1,450,000 to 1,850,000). That’s an increase of 550,000, or exactly 50 percent. 
The difference between 50 percent and 62 percent is ""well within the margin of error of any of these estimates,"" said Jeffrey S. Passel, a senior demographer at Pew who helped assemble the estimate. So the 60 percent increase Romney cited is broadly supported by the best estimates available. 
What about the numbers for California and Florida over the same period? According to the DHS figures, California had a 2 percent increase, while Florida had a 5 percent decrease. So Romney’s slightly off when he claims that California had ""no increase,"" but he has a point that both states were broadly stable over the period. 
Meanwhile, when rating promises of these sort, we always try to look not only at whether the facts are accurate, but also whether the public official being credited or blamed for the statistic has significant authority over the issue. 
In the case of immigration, governors have limited influence. 
""There are certain trends with respect to illegal immigration that are beyond the ability of any single state policymaker to counteract,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications for the Migration Policy Institute, which studies immigration issues. In addition, she said, ""border enforcement is almost entirely in the federal realm, and only federal policymakers can set the parameters for who has legal status in this country."" 
Still, Mittelstadt added, some states in recent years ""have taken on a greater role in immigration enforcement and policymaking, and state and local executives play a significant role in determining how welcoming or hostile their jurisdictions are perceived to unauthorized immigrants."" For instance, she said that under Perry, Texas has ""asserted a growing role for itself at the border."" 
Meanwhile, Ira Mehlman-- the media director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that seeks to stop illegal immigration -- added that while Perry has focused on border enforcement in Texas, he has not gone as far as, say, Arizona in ""removing incentives to come [il legally],"" including access to jobs and benefits -- ""the most important factors in controlling illegal immigration."" 
Our ruling 
Romney is essentially correct on the numbers, but his strong implication that Perry is responsible is a significant stretch. On balance, we rate the claim Half True. ",/factchecks/2011/oct/19/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-illegal-immigrant-population-rose/

Mitt Romney says Massachusetts residents favor state health care law by 3-to-1 margin
","
Comments about Mitt Romney's support of the Massachusetts health care plan prompted a testy exchange during the CNN Republican debate in Las Vegas. 
It began with former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum making an aside that Romney's plan ""was the basis for Obamacare. Your consultants helped Obama craft Obamacare."" 
Romney said he had consistently said it was""crafted for Massachusetts. It would be wrong to adopt this as a nation."" That prompted a feisty back-and-forth with head-shaking and interruptions. 
When the dust settled, Romney said, ""It was something crafted for a state. And I've said time and again, Obamacare is bad news. It's unconstitutional. It costs way too much money, a trillion dollars. And if I'm president of the United States, I will repeal it for the American people."" 
ANDERSON COOPER: ""All right. Senator Santorum?"" 
SANTORUM: ""Mitt, the governor of Massachusetts just is coming forward saying we have to pick up the job left undone by Romneycare, which is doing something about cutting health care costs. 
""What you did is exactly what Barack Obama did: focused on the wrong problem. Herman always says you've got to find the right problem. Well, the right problem is health care costs. What you did with a top-down, government-run program was focus on the problem of health care access. You expanded the pool of insurance without controlling costs. You've blown a hole in the budget up there. And you authored in Obamacare, which is going to blow a hole in the budget of this country."" 
COOPER: ""Governor Romney, I'm going to give you 30 seconds."" 
ROMNEY: ""I'm -- I'm sorry, Rick, that you find so much to dislike in my plan, but I'll tell you, the people in Massachusetts like it by about a 3-1 margin."" 
Romney made a similar claim during last week's debate, so we checked it out. 
We found one survey conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health and the Boston Globe. Interviews with a sample of 537 respondents age 18 and older were conducted from May 24 to May 26, 2011.

The survey asked this question, among others: ""Given what you know about it, in general, do you support or oppose the Massachusetts Universal Health Insurance Law?""

The pollsters found that 63 percent supported the law, 21 percent opposed the law, 6 percent didn’t know, and 9 percent hadn’t heard of the law. The ratio of 63 percent support and 21 percent opposition is exactly 3 to 1, supporting Romney’s claim. (Support is actually up compared to a previous Harvard-Globe poll in 2009, when the breakdown was 53 percent to 25 percent, or slightly over 2 to 1.)

And such levels of support don’t appear to be unusual. An annual survey sponsored by the Urban Institute and the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation has somewhat different methodology but found similar levels of support. Between 2006 and 2009, support for the law was, respectively, 69 percent, 71 percent, 72 percent and 67 percent. (We don’t know the exact ratio of support to opposition because the survey did not release the percentages for those who opposed the law or who had no opinion.)

""There is no discussion here of repealing the law,"" said Jeffrey Berry, a political scientist at Tufts University in Medford, Mass. ""Romney has it right in the sense that residents in Massachusetts don't want to repeal the law.""

Our ruling

Romney has strong support for this claim. A recent survey by a credible pollster found the ratio of support to opposition for the Massachusetts law at 3 to 1, and other polls suggest levels of support even higher. So we rate Romney’s statement True.

Fred Karger says Mitt Romney would have to put loyalty to Mormon church over job as president
","
In a comment published in The Guardian, a British newspaper, little-known Republican presidential candidate Fred Karger took aim at Mitt Romney for his Mormon faith.

Romney is among the first Mormons to have a serious shot at winning the presidency. Karger -- a gay Republican who has attracted little support in the polls -- suggested that, as president, Romney would face a conflict between the duties of his office and Mormon religion, also known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS.

""My major concern with the Mormon faith is the basic tenet of obedience,"" Karger told the newspaper. ""If a President Romney got a call from the president of the LDS, he has no choice but to obey. It is obedience over family and country."" 
Karger's remarks brought to mind an earlier debate in 1960 over whether John F. Kennedy would put allegiance to the Pope first. Kennedy took those concerns head on in a Sept. 12, 1960, speech to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association and went on to win the election.

To make sure Karger wasn’t misquoted, we contacted his campaign. Spokeswoman Rina Shah confirmed the authenticity of the quote. She also provided an additional statement from Karger.

""I have researched the LDS church and many of its beliefs over the past three years,"" Karger said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""Obedience is absolute. I have been told this in no uncertain terms by many Mormons and ex-Mormons. This life is merely a test of that. Look into the recent church campaign to get Switzerland to not ban LDS missionaries from its country.""

(Here is a statement by the church and some of the news coverage of the dispute with Switzerland.)

So is Karger’s claim that Romney would have to obey church over state accurate?

First, we’ll note that the church takes up this issue explicitly on its website.

""The church’s mission is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, not to elect politicians,"" the site says. ""The church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is neutral in matters of party politics. This applies in all of the many nations in which it is established.""

The statement goes on to say that ""the church does not … attempt to direct or dictate to a government leader."" It adds, ""Elected officials who are Latter-day Saints make their own decisions and may not necessarily be in agreement with one another or even with a publicly stated church position. While the church may communicate its views to them, as it may to any other elected official, it recognizes that these officials still must make their own choices based on their best judgment and with consideration of the constituencies whom they were elected to represent.""

When we contacted the LDS church, spokesman Lyman Kirkland had a one-sentence reply: ""Mr. Karger’s assertions are simply ridiculous.""

We also reached three scholars of Mormon theology and history, and all agreed that Karger’s concerns were misplaced. Here are some of their reactions to Karger’s statement.

Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond and author of such books as People of Paradox: A History of Mormon Culture and By the Hand of Mormon: The American Scripture that Launched a New World Religion:

""There is no basis in fact for the claim that Romney would have ‘no choice but to obey’ if he got a call from the LDS church president. On the rare occasion when church presidents make pronouncements on issues with political implications, such as a statement against abortion, or against the MX missile system, church members are free to act in compliance or in disregard for such pronouncements. No member has been disciplined for his or her political conduct, as the distribution of both Mormon voters and politicians across the political spectrum proves.""

Laurie Maffly-Kipp, adjunct professor of American studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and author of Proclamation to the People: 19th Century Mormonism and the Pacific Basin Frontier:

""It is his own interpretation of what Mormons do, not a policy or doctrine in the church. Members are always reminded that the dictates of their own conscience are paramount. A good example of this was when Mitt Romney's father, George, as governor of Michigan in 1964, supported the passage of a civil rights bill even when leaders in the LDS church wrote to him advising against it. As the church elder admitted in the letter he wrote to Gov. Romney, ‘I cannot deny you the right of your position if it represents your true belief and feelings.’ ""(The letter is available here.)

Grant Hardy, professor of history and religious studies at the University of North Carolina (Asheville) and author of Understanding the Book of Mormon: A Reader's Guide:

""The statement attributed to Fred Karger is not true. … Mr. Karger's quote may come from a misunderstanding of the LDS temple. Mormon temples are only open to members of the church who have a current temple ‘recommend,’ and one of the questions that must be answered positively to receive a recommend is, ‘Do you sustain the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the prophet, seer, and revelator, and as the only person on earth who possesses and is authorized to exercise all priesthood keys?’ But the word ‘sustain’ does not mean ‘obey’ or even ‘agree with in every particular.’ There is a long tradition in Mormonism of valuing agency and individual conscience. Similarly, in the temple ceremony itself, Latter-day Saints make a covenant of obedience, but it is obedience to God rather than obedience to the prophet or to the church.

""So if a President Romney got a call from the president of the LDS church -- which I don't think would ever happen -- he would not be required by the tenets of his faith to put obedience to the church over his duty to his country or his office.""

Hardy offered as an example the battle over Proposition 8 -- a California ballot initiative that barred same-sex marriage in the state. It passed with 52 percent of the vote in 2008, thanks in part to the strong support of the Mormon church.

""The church was strongly involved in their vocal support of Proposition 8,"" Hardy said. ""A majority of active members responded to the church's call to action, but those who did not, or who opposed the measure, remain Latter-day Saints in good standing."" (Karger was the founder of Californians Against Hate -- an opponent of Proposition 8. In that capacity, he ""led four boycotts and filed formal ethics violation complaints leading to investigations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,"" according to Karger’s resume.)

Our ruling

We don't see any evidence that Karger is correct that ""if a President Romney got a call from the president of the (Mormon church), he has no choice but to obey. It is obedience over family and country."" The church itself says in no uncertain terms that that’s not the case, and three scholars of the religion agree.
