Few blacks picked for Georgia posts, lawmaker says
","
Before the Georgia Legislature ended its 2013 session last month, one senator took Gov. Nathan Deal to task for what the lawmaker said was a lack of racial diversity amongst appointees to various state boards and positions. 
""Less than 3 percent of appointees, since they’ve taken office, by the executive branch have been African-American,"" said Sen. Vincent Fort, an Atlanta Democrat who is African-American. 
Fort held a spreadsheet in his hand that he said documented the disparity. Just nine of some 200 appointments since Deal, who is white, was sworn in as governor in January 2011 were African-American, the senator said. Three of those African-Americans were appointed to the state’s Martin Luther King Jr. Commission, Fort said. 
""The point I’m trying to make is this,"" Fort told his Senate colleagues. ""You see a lack of diversity in the appointments to government. That’s not right."" 
About 30 percent of Georgians and the state’s registered voters are African-American, U.S. census figures and Georgia Secretary of State Office’s records show. 
PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know whether Fort’s claim was correct. 
It took us some time to do our own research, but we found African-Americans accounted for 7 percent of Deal’s appointments. 
Brian Robinson, the governor’s communications director, told PolitiFact Georgia that the governor’s office does not keep a breakdown of Deal’s appointments by race. Robinson said the governor wants racial diversity among his appointees. Robinson explained that anyone can apply to serve on a state board and applicants are not asked beforehand about their race. 
""The applicants do not report their race on the forms, though, and they don’t submit photos, so it would be difficult to guess the demographic breakdown of the governor’s appointees,"" Robinson said. 
Through a spokeswoman for Senate Democrats, Fort forwarded us the spreadsheet he cited on the Senate floor. It had 209 appointments, with the names of each person, the organization that person was appointed to, their race and gender, and where he or she lives. The spreadsheet had the race of all but eight appointees. PolitiFact Georgia, though, found Deal has made more than 800 appointments. 
The spokeswoman, Liz Flowers, explained the spreadsheet was based on a review of Deal’s executive orders. We looked through all of the governor’s news releases, which helped us to compile a more detailed list of Deal’s appointments. 
Deal, a former congressman from Gainesville, was elected with seemingly little support from African-American voters. Deal, a Republican, fared poorly in counties with large black populations in the 2010 general election against Democrat Roy Barnes. In Clayton County, where 72 percent of voters are black, Deal won 17 percent of the vote. In Dougherty County, where nearly 65 percent of registered voters are black, Deal won 30 percent of the vote. 
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution examined Deal’s appointments in May 2011, shortly after he took office. The findings: 83 of Deal’s 87 appointees -- 95 percent -- were white. Deal’s predecessor, Sonny Perdue, also a Republican, appointed whites at an 87 percent clip during his first year in office. 
In general, Georgia Republicans have had trouble gaining the support of black voters. In 2010, less than 3 percent of the state’s black voters cast ballots in the Republican primary, according to Emory University assistant political science professor Andra Gillespie. The professor cautioned that primary turnouts are typically low, so some black Republicans may have stayed home. She added that since Georgia has open primaries, some black voters who cast ballots in that primary may not typically side with the GOP. 
University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock estimated that 5 percent of black voters statewide cast their ballots for Deal. 
Flowers and some Democrats insist the lack of black support for Deal should not remove them from consideration for appointments. 
Some African-Americans on state boards told the AJC that they inquired about various positions even though they didn’t vote for the governor. Deal sought out others he knew and asked them to serve, the AJC reported. 
As the AJC did in 2011, PolitiFact Georgia used the AJC’s voter database, which comes from the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, as the primary source for our research. The database lists each Georgia voter, giving his or her full name, race, date of birth, gender and address. We also conducted detailed Internet searches to match the names of some appointees. It took us more than two weeks to compile our research. 
  
Fort’s spreadsheet went from the beginning of Deal’s term to the end of February 2013. We looked at appointments up to the date Fort made his comments. There have been some appointments since March 26. 
We examined appointments Deal made to state boards, commissions, councils and judicial positions. The appointments range from the state Board of Public Safety to the Board of Hearing Aid Dealers and Dispensers. 
Many appointees were small business owners. Nearly 70 percent of them were men. We counted 53 appointees who live in Gainesville, Deal’s hometown. Atlanta was the only city with more appointees on our list. Thirty-seven people were appointed to more than one board. 
And how many were black? Sixty-one of the 843, according to our count, or slightly more than 7 percent. 
A handful listed their race as ""other."" Fourteen were listed as ""unknown."" A small number listed their race as Asian or Hispanic. The remainder, nearly 90 percent of them, were white. 
Robinson defended the governor’s efforts toward racial inclusiveness. 
""[M]any agency heads hired by Governor Deal are African-American, and the governor recently appointed the state’s first Asian-American woman judge to sit on the Court of Appeals,"" Robinson said. ""The governor’s actions in the recent DeKalb County school case also provide a telling example. Our liaisons were a white man and a black man. Our nominating panel was majority African-American, and five of the six board members that he appointed are African-American."" 
To sum up, Fort said during a Senate session that less than 3 percent of the governor’s appointees are African-American. Our research showed it’s slightly more than 7 percent. 
The senator’s overarching claim that Deal has appointed a relatively low percentage of minorities has merit. But he was wrong by a handful of percentage points. It was based on an incomplete sampling of Deal’s total appointees. 
We rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/apr/23/vincent-fort/few-blacks-picked-georgia-posts-lawmaker-says/

State Rep. Linda Finn says that in Rhode Island, police who encounter a young person with a gun can’t legally take it from them
","
In the wake of the Newtown, Conn., shootings, the Rhode Island General Assembly is considering a package of bills intended to tighten the state’s gun laws, including restrictions on assault weapons and harsher penalties for gun violations. 
WPRI’s ""Newsmakers"" explored the topic on a program featuring state Rep. Linda D. Finn, D-Middletown, who has argued for more gun restrictions, and state Rep. Michael W. Chippendale, R-Foster, who has argued that laws already in place can address concerns if only they were properly enforced. 
At one point, Tim White, the show’s host, brought up one of the proposed bills, which would make it illegal for anyone under 18 to possess a gun, aside from exceptions such as hunting, rifle ranges and competitive target shooting. 
Chippendale called the proposal ""well intended, but poorly drafted,"" saying it would contradict another law on the books that provides for licensed hunting by young people. 
Finn countered that the proposal is intended for police on the streets of Providence and other cities when they come upon a minor with a firearm. 
""Because right now, if they [the police] come across a [young] person with a gun, they really don't legally have the right to take it away from them,"" Finn said. 
We wondered whether Finn’s statement was accurate. 
The legislation in question is actually an amendment of Rhode Island statute 11-47-33. 
The statute currently says ""possession and use"" of certain firearms by someone under age 18 is prohibited in Rhode Island unless he or she has had a permit issued -- under 11-47-34 -- by the Rhode Island State Police or by a local police chief. And that permit can only be issued, the law states, ""upon satisfactory proof of being engaged in a course of training in the use of firearms at a regular and recognized camp or rifle range, and provided that the person has the written consent of a guardian."" 
The bill in the legislature calls for dropping the words ""and use"" from 11-47-33. 
The reason? According to Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin’s office, the bill was filed because ""currently, for a minor to be guilty of possession of a firearm they must possess and use the firearm."" 
Steven M. Pare, the Providence public safety commissioner, said police chiefs support the revision of statute 11-47-33 that would remove the words ""and use,"" making it illegal in most cases for juveniles simply to possess a firearm. 
Despite Finn’s assertion the the police can’t take guns away from minors, Pare, said that police can and do charge young people with possession of handguns, using another statute, 11-47-8, which prohibits minors from obtaining a carry/conceal permit. 
But there’s another issue in current law, that gives some credence to Finn’s claim. 
The Attorney General’s office says that due to what it calls a loophole, the law does not cover shotguns, rifles and other long guns, Kempe said, which could include such weapons as an AK-47, AR-15 and an M-16 -- so long as those are not fully automatic. (Possession of automatic weapons is illegal in all cases.) 
In other words, if the police see a juvenile carrying such a weapon, they can’t confiscate it under current law. 
Kempe said the ""long guns"" at issue are rarely something the police encounter on the streets involving minors; pistols and revolvers, which are already covered under current law and for which the police can arrest and seize the guns, are much more common, she said. 
Our ruling 
State Rep. Linda D. Finn said that if the police come across a young person with a gun, ""they really don't legally have the right to take it away from them."" 
Under current law, police can seize handguns from juveniles, the weapons most commonly used in street crime. But they can’t seize rifles and other so-called long guns. 
New legislation could change that. 
But for now, we rate Finn’s claim Half True.

Carlos Gimenez says Miami Dolphins are the only property tax payer in the NFL
","
The Miami Dolphins are attempting to score what would be an incredibly fast political touchdown: a one-month campaign to convince Miami-Dade County voters to sign off on a stadium construction deal. 
After nearly around the clock negotiations at the stadium and county hall, fueled by frequent runs for Cuban cafecito, County Mayor Carlos Gimenez hammered out a deal with the Dolphins. 
During the county meeting on April 10, 2013, when commissioners signed off on the referendum, Commissioner Sally Heyman asked if the stadium would continue to pay property taxes. During the negotiations, the Dolphins proposed turning over the stadium ownership to the county. The team had also appealed their property taxes two years in a row but then dropped the appeals. 
Gimenez replied: 
""Commissioner, as far as I know the Miami Dolphins are the only professional team in the state of Florida that actually pays property taxes. And, as far as I know, the Dolphins are the only NFL team in the entire nation that pays property taxes. This does not change."" 
At PolitiFact Florida, our ears perk up when we hear that something is the ""only"" one in the country. Are the Miami Dolphins the only NFL team to pay property taxes? 
For the $350 million stadium deal to go forward, the tax-weary Legislature must sign off on some of the financing before the session ends May 3, and then Miami-Dade voters must approve it in a May 14 referendum. By May 22, the NFL will decide whether to award the 50th Super Bowl in 2016 to Miami or San Francisco. 
Focusing on property taxes is just one piece of the finances of a stadium. Nearly all NFL stadiums have received public financing of some sort. 
""No property taxes on stadiums is a part of the negotiation between the team and the relevant government entities – the trade-off very likely is a bigger subsidy coupled with property taxes, or smaller subsidies and property tax exemptions,"" Robert Baade, a business of sports professor at Lake Forest, told PolitiFact Florida in an email. 
Dolphins property taxes 
In making his statement, Gimenez was repeating something he heard from Dolphins owner Stephen Ross during negotiation meetings, County spokeswoman Suzy Trutie told PolitiFact Florida. 
""We’re the only team in the country that doesn’t have any public dollars with our stadium. We pay full real estate taxes. We’re the only team in Florida and the only team in the NFL that pays full real estate taxes,"" Ross was quoted in the Miami Herald in March. ""We’re not looking to be relieved of that ... ."" 
Dolphins spokesman Eric Jotkoff said Ross’ statement refers to the land and the stadium, although the land is owned by the county. 
Trutie said that the $3 million in real estate taxes is for ""the building and the land, even though the county owns the land.""   
The Dolphins tax bill for the stadium itself was about $3.6 million in 2012 -- that includes about $3 million in real estate taxes and the rest was for tangible personal property and local business taxes, Miami-Dade tax records show. The tax bill for the parking lots is about $368,000. 
Washington Redskins and Carolina Panthers pay stadium property taxes 
We contacted multiple NFL teams and found two in addition to the Dolphins that pay property taxes on their stadiums: the Washington Redskins and the Carolina Panthers. Spokespersons for the teams as well as local government officials confirmed for PolitiFact that the teams pay property taxes on the stadiums. 
The Redskins own FedEx Field in Landover, Md. The Redskins paid about $3 million for in 2013 -- most of that is for property taxes and includes a small fee for solid waste collection, according to Prince George’s County. The amount of business personal property taxes for a related stadium entity was $406,230.24. 
The Carolina Panthers paid about $1.7 million in property taxes on the Bank of America stadium in Charlotte for 2011, the year of the most recent valuation, according to Eric Anderson, deputy director in the Mecklenburg County assessor’s office. 
The Panthers lease the city-owned land for $1 a year. The team paid a tax on the lease, which was about $346,246 for 2011. The team also paid business personal property tax of about $313,800. 
The Panthers have had some battles in the past with Mecklenburg County about the taxes. During a revaluation of the property in 2003, the county raised the value. 
""The county gave you a huge break on this, if you want to know the truth,"" Ham Wade, the county's attorney, told the team's appraiser at one point during that battle. 
Payments in lieu of taxes 
In some cases, stadiums don’t pay property taxes but they do make a payment in lieu of taxes -- and that payment can be substantial. Take for example the town of Foxborough, population 17,000, that gets about $2 million for payment in lieu of taxes from the New England Patriots. That payment is about 40 to 60 percent less than the amount would be if the team paid property taxes, estimated the town’s finance director Randy Scollins. 
The payment plan is controversial, but Scollins told PolitiFact ""I see the wisdom in it. The theory is that wouldn’t we be so lucky as to have an economic engine in your back yard."" 
The New York Giants and the New York Jets don’t pay property taxes on their shared MetLife stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. (However, the borough is in negotiations and in court about whether the Giants should pay $1.5 million in property taxes on a training facility within the same sports complex as the stadium.) 
The city receives a payment in lieu of property taxes -- about $7.2 million through the New Jersey Sports & Exposition Authority. A portion of that comes from the stadium, East Rutherford mayor James Cassella told PolitiFact. 
""Technically they don’t pay property taxes, but they do pay money to the municipality,"" he said. 
Our ruling 
Gimenez said during a county meeting that the Miami Dolphins ""are the only NFL team in the entire nation that pays property taxes."" 
That’s not accurate: two additional NFL teams pay property taxes on their stadiums. For the most recent year available, the Carolina Panthers paid about $1.7 million while the Washington Redskins paid about $3 million. 
Some teams pay some sort of other payment in lieu of property taxes. Technically, those aren’t property taxes, but in the case of the New England Patriots, the $2 million payment to the town of Foxborough isn’t too shabby. 
Gimenez exaggerated when he said that the Dolphins are the only NFL team in the country that pays property taxes. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2013/apr/22/carlos-gimenez/carlos-gimenez-says-miami-dolphins-are-only-proper/

Sen. Dianne Feinstein says every national poll this year shows support for assault weapons ban
","Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told fellow senators before they voted down her renewed ban on assault weapons that the American people sided with her. What’s more, she told them: Every poll said so. ""In poll after poll, that support is there,"" she remarked from the Senate floor on April 17, 2013, the same day broader gun control legislation failed. ""In no poll — even with all the discussion, even with the mobilization of gun owners and the NRA, a majority in every single national poll done shows that the majority want controls over assault weapons. I know of no poll done this year that shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons."" A 1994 assault weapons ban, written by Feinstein, lapsed in 2004. After a gunman killed 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012, she proposed the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 — a renewal and expansion of the original ban. Senators, who considered it as an amendment to a broader bill, voted 40 to 60 against it. Did they vote against a majority of Americans? ""No poll done this year ... shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons,"" Feinstein said. We went in search of polls. ‘Assault weapons’ We combed through 18 polls with questions about assault weapons conducted between Jan. 9 and April 7. Nearly half of them occurred in January, both before and after President Barack Obama released his plan to reduce gun violence. He called for ""banning military-style assault weapons."" Feinstein’s bill, introduced a week after the president’s plan, proposed blocking the future manufacture, possession, sale and importation of 157 specific ""semiautomatic assault weapons,"" such as AK-47s and UZIs, along with any other weapon with a detachable magazine and at least one ""military characteristic,"" such as a pistol grip or barrel shroud. Pollsters used a range of phrases to describe firearms as they asked Americans about their support or opposition to a ban, from ""assault rifles and semiautomatic weapons"" to ""military-style assault weapons."" Here's a quick look at the results: Poll Date Question Support for ban Reason-Rupe Jan. 17-21, 2013 ""Do you think people should be prohibited from owning assault weapons, or should people be allowed to own them?"" 44% CNN/ORC International April 5-7, 2013 ""Please tell me whether you would generally favor or oppose each of the following proposals which some people have made to reduce the amount of gun violence. ...

In 15 polls, conducted by organizations from ABC News/Washington Post to Quinnipiac University, the idea of a ban on such weapons got support from 54 percent to 69 percent of respondents, depending on the timing and phrasing of the question. In two, from CNN/ORC International and Fox News in April and March, support was 51 percent — with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. That means the polls reflected support between 48 percent and 54 percent, perhaps a majority and perhaps not. In other words, the ""majority"" wasn’t statistically significant. And one poll, from the libertarian Reason Foundation, asked the question in a distinctly different way, and got a different result. Most pollsters asked whether people supported or opposed a ban on assault weapons. Reason asked: ""Do you think people should be prohibited from owning assault weapons, or should people be allowed to own them?"" They found that just 44 percent of respondents thought people should be prohibited from owning assault weapons. We’ll note that the question goes beyond Feinstein’s legislation. Nothing in the bill would have prohibited people who already owned such weapons from keeping them. Still, argued Emily Ekins of Reason, ""response variability across polls demonstrates support for an assault weapons ban is not as clear cut as some may have previously thought."" Indeed, a USA Today/Gallup poll from December, in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shootings, also showed only 44 percent support for a law similar to Feinstein’s. Meanwhile, polls showed a partisan divide. In a January poll from Pew Research Center, for example, 55 percent of respondents favored an assault weapons ban. But just 44 percent of Republicans did. And a separate poll from Quinnipiac University in February showed that nearly half of Republicans might be less likely to vote for a member of Congress who voted for a ban on the sale of assault weapons — in addition to a third of independents and 11 percent of Democrats. That lack of support was most pronounced in the West. So, while national support was generally strong, as Feinstein said, individual lawmakers faced a different reality. Our ruling Feinstein claimed that a majority of the American people supported her bill, saying ""no poll done this year ... shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons."" She's largely accurate, though the ""majority"" in two national polls wasn’t statistically significant, and a poll by a libertarian foundation showed less than majority support for prohibiting assault weapon ownership. Meanwhile, limiting her statement to ""this year"" excluded a USA Today/Gallup poll from December that undermined her point. Still, the libertarian poll went beyond Feinstein’s proposal, which didn’t prohibit ownership of assault weapons by those who already own them. Otherwise, two polls teetered on the edge of majority support, while 15 others unequivocally supported her claim.

1000 Friends says demand for public transit at all-time high in Wisconsin
","
The environmental group 1000 Friends of Wisconsin sees at least 10 reasons to change the way the state Department of Transportation spends money. 
The Madison-based group opposed the cut in state funds for public transit in Gov. Scott Walker’s first budget, which simultaneously boosted aid for highways. In the end, state lawmakers moderated Walker’s 10 percent cut  by adding to the funding for transit for disabled riders. 
Now, with Walker’s second two-year budget awaiting action, 1000 Friends is pushing state lawmakers to restore the 2011-13 transit cuts. 
""We should allocate more funds for transit to respond to the increase in demand and ridership,"" the group said in an April 11, 2013 press release. ""Transit ridership in America is at its highest in 50 years and demand for public transportation is reaching record levels in Wisconsin, yet transit systems in the state are in jeopardy of disappearing due to lack of state support."" 
The group’s claim that  ""demand for public transportation is reaching record levels in Wisconsin"" got our attention. 
Let’s take this one for a spin. 
  
Record ridership? 
When asked for backup, 1000 Friends pointed to a mix of ridership statistics and state and national demographic and lifestyle trends. 
Officials with the group reference a ""substantial increase"" in transit trips over the last decade in Wisconsin -- not including Milwaukee County -- based on the National Transit Database. That database covers fixed-route buses, van and taxi service for the disabled, trolleys, light rail and other forms of public transit in Wisconsin, excluding Amtrak passenger rail. 
The trend ""shows that demand is going up,"" 1000 Friends executive director Steve Hiniker said. 
Maybe so. But up to ""record levels""? 
We ran the numbers with help from the Federal Transit Administration’s National Transit Database and found a 37 percent jump in transit trips outside Milwaukee County from 2002 to 2012.  In 2011, Madison reported its highest bus ridership since the late 1980s, La Crosse its highest in 30 years and Valley Transit in the Fox Cities its highest since 1995. 
And the group correctly cites U.S. figures showing that national transit ridership, including trains, has grown since the 1960s, driven mostly by strong interest in light rail and heavy rail. Bus ridership has remained mostly flat. The trends were reported in 2012 by the American Public Transportation Association using the national database. 
But two others sets of numbers provided by the group, and confirmed by PolitiFact Wisconsin, paint a much different picture. 
Once you include Milwaukee County -- the largest transit agency in the state by far -- the trend becomes a drop of 8 percent in rides comparing 2002 to 2012. 
Three of the last four years show decreases. 
The Milwaukee County Transit System’s bus service has steadily lost ridership -- nearly 30 percent by one estimate -- since 2002 as it has cut routes and eliminated stops due to funding shortages. Fares have increased 50 percent in 11 years. 
The Milwaukee County numbers are enough to put the statewide trend into the negative. 
The bottom line: Trips statewide totalled more than 71 million in 2012, down from about 77 million in 2002. 
That puts a dent in the group’s claim about ""record levels"" in Wisconsin. 
Transit cuts 
Hiniker argues that the statewide figures don’t tell the whole story on demand for transit in Wisconsin because funding cuts have led to higher fares and made transit less available, while other states have added service. 
Outside of Milwaukee, total transit ridership dipped in 2012 after the transit cuts in Walker’s first budget, according to figures from the national database. The city of Racine, for example, reported a double-digit drop in 2012 bus rides after raising fares 33 percent following the budget cut. A year earlier, ridership had jumped 10 percent. 
""Most of my clients are on a fixed income,"" said Al Stanek, Racine’s transit manager. ""Our customers just end up riding less while spending the same amount of money on transportation."" 
Demand can be up, or remain steady, even as ridership declines, Stanek and Hiniker said. 
Researchers cite funding levels -- and their impact on fares and convenience -- as among the many factors that influence ridership demand. 
So funding cuts can help explain why ridership is not higher. 
But that lack of supply is not evidence that demand is reaching ""record levels."" 
The group also argued that demand is a function of lifestyle and demographic trends at the state and national level, as well as U.S. ridership trends. 
Wisconsin’s over-60 population is growing, and that ""has implications for ... expanded transit services for drivers who transition from cars to public transportation or paratransit services,"" the state’s Commission on Transportation Finance and Policy concluded in a January 2013 report. 
The same state report found that  ""young people are waiting longer to apply for driver licenses."" That, along with national surveys showing more young people are turning to transit supports an inference that young Wisconsinites do too, Hiniker said. 
Hiniker conceded, though, that ""sloppy"" work explained why the group’s press release asserted that demand was at an all time high in Wisconsin. 
The intended statement, which is on the group’s website, said simply that demand was up nationwide, without mentioning Wisconsin, he said. 

Our rating 
1000 Friends of Wisconsin, arguing for restoration of transit aid, claimed that ""Demand for public transportation is reaching record levels in Wisconsin."" 
The group can point to hot spots where ridership in 2011 reached heights unseen for many years, and makes a decent argument that transit cuts have suppressed demand. 
But its claim goes well beyond that, suggesting a quantifiable statewide trend at ""record"" levels -- and hard evidence of that is lacking.

Congress away too often, Georgia lawmaker says
","
Congress has received record-low approval ratings in recent years, thanks largely to the oceanlike divide on issues such as federal spending, taxes and gun control. 
One Georgia congressman offered another reason for public scorn. 
""On January 3rd, a new Congress convened with a mandate from voters all across this country to work together. Unfortunately, very little has changed. Too many in Congress are unwilling to compromise and do what’s necessary to get this country moving,"" said John Barrow, a Democratic House member from Augusta. ""Sixty-six out of the first 100 days of this Congress have been spent in recess. That’s shameful. While I'd much rather be in Georgia meeting with folks across the 12th District, we have a lot of work to do in Washington."" 
Barrow, who’s reportedly entertaining a run for the U.S. Senate, went on to say in the letter that he hasn’t been letting the grass grow under his feet during these many absences. 
""During those 66 days of recess, I’ve been busy meeting with folks all across the 12th  District.  I’ve visited with folks and held events in all 19 counties of the 12th Congressional District,"" Barrow said. 
PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Barrow’s claim about Congress being in recess an average of two out of every three days was accurate, or is he trying to score some political points at the expense of his colleagues. 
Barrow spokesman RIchard Carbo forwarded us a calendar prepared by the staff of one of the most influential Democrats in the House of Representatives, Steny Hoyer of Maryland. It notes in red each day Congress is scheduled to have votes this year. 
As Barrow wrote, the first day of the 113th Congress was Jan. 3, 2013. April 12 would have marked 100 calendar days since this Congress was convened. Hoyer’s calendar shows Congress held sessions to vote on 34 of those 100 days. 
We reviewed a Library of Congress calendar and found it had 41 days that Congress had been in session. Carbo explained that the Library of Congress calendar includes ""pro forma"" days, days when the House met for just a few minutes to conduct procedural matters. 
""There are lots of 10-minute sessions where there is no one around,"" said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar with the American Enterprise Institute who has done extensive research on the machinations of Congress. 
Carbo also asserted ""pro forma"" sessions are held by the House’s Republican leadership to prevent President Barack Obama, a Democrat, from making appointments while Congress is in recess. 
The Congressional Record website shows that the House met for two to five minutes all of those days. The Senate, by our review of the Congressional Record’s information, met 33 of the first 100 days it was in session. Hoyer’s calendar does not include Jan. 21, in which both chambers of Congress were in a special session for the president’s public inauguration. 
We wondered whether the number of days Congress was in session the first 100 days of 2013 was disproportionate to past years. PolitiFact Georgia went back 20 years, looking at each odd year since those were years a new Congress was sworn into office. This year was in the middle. 
Here is the Library of Congress breakdown, not excluding possible ""pro forma"" days: 
1995: 58 days 
2007: 49 days 
2009: 48 days 
2011: 46 days 
2003: 42 days 
2013: 41 days 
2001: 35 days 
2005: 33 days 
1999: 33 days 
1997: 33 days 
Donald Wolfensberger, who worked 28 years for several Republican members of Congress with an expertise in parliamentary rules, offered one reason for the seemingly low number of days this Congress has been in session. 
""New Congresses take time to get committees organized and then for them to start cranking out legislation. Slow starts are not unusual,"" said Wolfensberger, a senior scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. 
Ornstein, a columnist who co-wrote a book called ""The Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failing America and How to Get It Back on Track,"" said he has long pushed for a congressional schedule of three weeks in session and one week off. Ornstein had a few ideas why Congress, particularly the Republican-led House, is not interested in meeting much in Washington. 
""They have an adversarial relationship with (Obama) and less in common,"" Ornstein said. 
Ornstein offered another reason members of Congress, regardless of party affiliation, may want to spend less time in session: It’s tougher to raise the large sums of money now necessary to stay in office, and being in session takes time away from fundraising. 
To sum up, Barrow said Congress spent 66 of the first 100 days of the current session in recess. There were a few additional days the House was in session, albeit very, very short meetings. With that bit of context, we believe Barrow’s claim is Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/apr/22/john-barrow/congress-away-too-often-georgia-lawmaker-says/
"['City Budget', 'Water', 'Virginia', 'Dwight Jones']","
Dwight Jones says his budget would lower water bills for half of Richmond homes
","
Richmond Mayor Dwight Jones sees his plan to overhaul the city’s water and wastewater rates as a glass half full. 
His plan cuts in half the base rates that all customers pay simply to have access to the city’s water system. It also more than doubles a second charge to customers based on the amount of water they use and flush into the sewer system. 
""Through this rate structure change, an estimated 50 percent of our residential households will see a decrease in their water and wastewater bills,"" Jones said in a March 12 news release announcing the plan. 
We wondered if the mayor was correct. 
Under his plan, the monthly base rate charged to all customers for water and wastewater service would drop from $49.40 to $26.11. Meanwhile, the second monthly payment based on the volume of water used would rise from $4.22 to $9.03 for every 100 cubic feet that comes into their taps or leaves their home as wastewater. That 100 cubic feet, listed as a ""ccf"" on a resident’s water bill, amounts to about 750 gallons -- roughly 15 bathtubs full. 
The new rates are part of Jones’ proposal for a Richmond budget that is scheduled for a City Council vote May 13. Jones said his rates are not aimed at generating more revenues but were designed to shift more of the burden of supporting the utility to the residents who use the most water. 
Tammy Hawley, a spokeswoman for the mayor, sent us a Department of Public Utilities chart breaking down the number of residential customers by their water use. The chart showed that 25,904 customers were billed for using 400 cubic feet or less each month in the 2012 fiscal year, the most recently completed budget cycle. 
That comes to about half of the city’s 51,832 residential customers. 
Another chart Hawley sent shows that anyone charged for using 400 cubic feet or less would see lower bills. That’s because the increase in their volume fee would be less than the savings they would get from the halving of the base rate. 
People right at that 400 cubic foot threshold now pay $66.28 a month. The new rates would drop their monthly bills to $62.23 -- a savings of $4.05. The less water they use, the greater their savings. 
For example, customers who use 200 cubic feet  would save $13.67 each month. Their monthly bills, now $57.84, would drop to $44.17. 
City charts show that the biggest savers would be the 13.7 percent of customers who use ""0 ccf"" a month. That doesn’t mean these households don’t use water, just that they consumed less than the 750 gallons threshold necessary to trigger a volume charge, said Angela Fountain, a spokeswoman with the Richmond Department of Public Utilities. So these users, who only pay the base rate, would save $23.29 a month. 
But 750 gallons is precious little water to use in a month. Such a household would be limited daily to a 5-minute shower, one tooth brushing, one hand washing and several toilet flushes and monthly to two loads of laundry and several dish washings, according to estimates from the U.S. Geological Survey. We wondered if some of those households might be properties where no one is living but where someone still pays a water bill, such as a vacant apartment. 
Fountain said no one knows. 
""If we’re sending them a bill, then we believe the property is occupied, that someone is using water there,"" she said. ""We can’t tell you how many people, how often they’re there. We just don’t have that information."" 
So the mayor is correct that his plan cuts water and wastewater rates for half the city households. The unsaid part, of course, is that it raises rates for the other half -- those billed monthly for using 500 cubic feet or more. 
We should note that the average residential household uses 600 cubic feet in water and wastewater each month, according to Raftelis Financial Consultants, a group that examined the Richmond’s utility pricing in a March 2013 report. Such customers will see their bill rise from $74.72 to $80.29 -- a $5.57 increase. 
Our ruling 
The mayor said that under his plan, half of the city’s residences would see a drop in water bills. 
His carefully worded statement is accurate. The unspoken part is that 50 percent will see their bills increase. The mayor also omits that his proposal would lead to a modest rate hike for the average water user. 
The mayor is correct, but his statement benefits from additional information. 
We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/apr/22/dwight-jones/dwight-jones-says-his-budget-would-lower-water-bil/

Ohio Public Defender’s Office says sex offender registry doesn’t improve public safety
","
Ohio will begin tracking arsonists this summer through a new registry similar to the one used to track sex offenders. 
A law passed last year by the General Assembly will require people convicted of arson-related offenses to register at their local sheriff's office each year for at least 10 years. Failing to register will be a felony. 
Supporters tout the measure as a tool for law enforcement. Critics argue, among other points, that the registry will be a burden for sheriffs already charged with keeping the sex-offender registry. 
""The sex-offender registry has been around for a long time, and the research that's out there says that it has no positive impact on the public safety,"" Amy Borror, spokeswoman for the Ohio Public Defender's Office, told The Plain Dealer. ""And, if anything, it might have a negative impact on public safety because it creates this administrative burden."" 
The registry has been around for almost 20 years and has been public for more than 15. The Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children Act, enacted by Congress in 1994, required convicted sex offenders to record their address with local law enforcement. Megan’s Law, added in 1996, allowed the information to be given directly to the public. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), passed in 2006, set registration standards that widened the reach of registration for the entire nation. 
PolitiFact Ohio knew the subject could be an emotional one. We asked Borror how the claim is supported that the registry does not improve public safety. 
She referred us first to the website of the Public Defender's Office, which links to a number of reports, and to a special issue of the peer-reviewed journal Criminal Justice and Behavior, from May 2010, which was dedicated to sex offender issues. 
Criminal Justice and Behavior published 10 academic studies related to sex offenses, focusing 
on the question of whether public policies concerning sex offenders enhance the safety of children and communities. 
The journal found that the subject is consistently one of the leading policy issues on legislative agendas. It concluded, however, that ""sex offender policies are often inconsistent with empirical evidence about sex offender risks, recidivism, reintegration and supervision.... 
""Legislators cite the news media and the views of their constituents -- not research evidence -- as their primary sources of information about sex offenses and offenders,"" the journal said. 
  
One of the published studies, by criminologists with the University of Massachusetts, Lynn University and the Colorado Division of Criminal Justice, focused on Ohio and Oklahoma, two of the first states to meet federal guidelines set by SORNA. Those guidelines classify offenders into one of three categories determined by solely by convicted offense. (Previously, judges determined what risk offenders posed and assigned them to one of three registration categories.) 
Drawing on data from more than 28,000 cases in Ohio and from other research, the study’s conclusions  ""shed doubt on the public safety utility of the SORNA classification system.""  It found that a disproportionate number of offenders were classified as high risk, placing greater burdens, perhaps unnecessarily, on law enforcement personnel and budgets. 
""From a public safety perspective,"" the study found, the SORNA classification guidelines hurt the ability of the system ""to effectively discriminate between those who pose a substantial risk to society and those who pose minimal risk,"" and also contradict evidence about the risk of repeat offenses for both adult sex offenders and juveniles. 
Another report, from the Minnesota Department of Corrections, studied sexual offenders who were jailed for failing to register with local law enforcement agencies. It found that the failure to register was not a predictor of repeated crime, other than future failure to register. 
An analysis of adult arrest data from 1990 to 2005 in South Carolina found that sex offender registration laws did have a deterrent effect on first-time adult offenders, but no effect on juveniles and no effect on recidivism. 
Borror also pointed us to a 2009 study from the state of  New York’s Office of Mental Health that specifically compares a risk-based classification system (which Ohio used to have) to the offense-based registration system, which Ohio has now. 
It concluded that the current system ""falls short of increasing public safety,"" citing five earlier studies that found registration and notification laws were ""ineffective methods of reducing sexual victimizations."" 
It also noted there is evidence that such laws actually lead to more criminal behavior by aggravating the factors linked to it -- an unintended consequence of reducing or denying employment, educational, social and housing opportunities. 
""Although well intended, such laws have done little (if anything) to increase public safety and may in fact be lowering it,"" the study said. 
(A 2007 report by the non-government organization Human Rights Watch detailed the harassment of registered offenders because of online community notification.) 
We looked further and found a 2008 report funded by the U.S. Justice Department examining the original Megan's Law in New Jersey. 
""Despite widespread community support for these laws,"" it said, ""there is virtually no evidence to support their effectiveness in reducing either new first-time sex offenses (through protective measures or general deterrence) or sex re-offenses (through protective measures and specific deterrence). 
""Given the lack of demonstrated effect of Megan’s Law on sexual offenses, the growing 
costs may not be justifiable,"" it said. 
Another study, by J.J. Prescott of the University of Michigan Law School and Jonah Rockoff of Columbia Business School and the National Bureau of Economic Research, examined data from 15 states over more than 10 years. 
They found that registering sex offenders does reduce sex crime, especially among victims with a personal connection to offenders, most likely because of better police monitoring.  They also found, however, that making the registry information available to the public has the opposite effect and increases crime. 
""There is little evidence of a decrease in crimes against strangers,"" the study said. ""We also find evidence that community notification deters crime, but in a way unanticipated by legislators. Our 
results suggest that community notification deters first-time sex offenders, but may increase recidivism by registered offenders by increasing the relative attractiveness of criminal behavior. This finding is consistent with work by criminologists showing that notification may contribute to recidivism by imposing social and financial costs on registered sex offenders and, as a result, making non-criminal activity relatively less attractive. 
""We regard this latter finding as potentially important, given that the purpose of 
community notification is the reduction of recidivism,"" the authors concluded. 
The federal Government Accountability Office evaluated the effects of SORNA in a report issued earlier this year. 
The GAO noted that law’s purpose is to protect the public from sex offenders, but found ""analysis of the act’s effect on public safety has been limited."" 
Positive effects included ""improved monitoring of registered sex offenders"" and better information sharing between law enforcement agencies. 
Negative consequences found by the GAO included a lack of consideration of the risk of repeating sexual offenses in classifying offenders; a disproportionate increase in the workload of law enforcement agencies, and increased problems for registered sex offenders to find work or housing. 
What conclusion can we draw about Borror’s statement for the Ohio Public Defender’s Office,  that research shows the sex offender registry has no positive impact? 
We found that research has been done generally on the effectiveness of sex offender registration and notification laws.   
We found that studies indicate the laws have no clear effect on recidivism, or repeat offenses, which is their intended target, and are ineffective in assessing and managing risk. 
Although there is some indication that registration and community notification may deter first-time adult offenders, the studies find that the deterrence doesn’t extend to juveniles -- and that community notification likely increases repeat sex crimes and other crimes. 
With that information needed for clarification, we rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/apr/22/ohio-public-defenders-office/ohio-public-defenders-office-says-sex-offender-reg/

Abraham Lincoln backed slavery measures, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan says
","
Over the years, PolitiFact has verified some interesting trivia about Abraham Lincoln. 
A claim that wrestling was one of Lincoln’s favorite sports he’s in the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, it turns out) was rated True. So was a claim that Lincoln once slipped out a window in an attempt to prevent vote in the Illinois Legislature. 
Now comes a more serious claim -- that the Great Emancipator once supported slavery measures. 
U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., made the statement in a speech April 11, 2013 to the Susan B. Anthony List, a group that seeks to elect pro-life women to Congress. 
The potential 2016 presidential candidate invoked Lincoln in arguing that abortion opponents should try to appeal to ""the broadest audience"" by working, when possible, with abortion rights supporters. 
""Our forebears knew to strive for perfection, not to expect it -- because mankind is flawed. Progress takes time. It takes work. And it takes common sense,"" Ryan said midway through his speech, entitled ""Building a Coalition for Life."" 
""Take Lincoln. He hated slavery as much as anyone. But he defended a law that preserved it. He supported the Compromise of 1850, which prohibited slavery in California but allowed it in New Mexico. He even backed a law to return runaway slaves to their owners."" 
Lincoln agreed to compromises, Ryan asserted, ""if they brought him closer to his goal -- even in just a small way. We all know what happened. After years of turmoil, he helped pass the Thirteenth Amendment, which ended slavery for good."" 
We’ll check the two specific parts of Ryan’s claim -- that Lincoln supported an agreement that allowed slavery in New Mexico ""and a law to return runaway slaves to their owners."" 
Ryan’s position 
Asked to back Ryan’s statement, his press secretary, Kevin Seifert, cited this passage from Lincoln, a biography by historian David Herbert Donald: 
Lincoln ""did not call for the elimination of slavery in all national territories; he stood pledged to the Compromise of 1850, which allowed New Mexico and Utah to tolerate or to forbid slavery. He accepted the Fugitive Slave Act, though he suggested it should be modified so that it would ‘not in its stringency, be more likely to carry a free man into slavery, than our ordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one.’"" 
Seifert also cited a document that notes that the Compromise in 1850, which admitted California into the Union as a free state and allowed New Mexico, then a territory, to decide whether to allow slavery. 
To dig further, we consulted eight Lincoln experts. They generally agreed Ryan’s statement is partially accurate, but lacks key details. 
New Mexico and slavery 
While Ryan said Lincoln ""supported"" the Compromise in 1850, Lincoln was actually semi-retired from politics at the time, having left Congress a year earlier (he wasn’t elected president until 1860). 
At the time of the compromise Lincoln did not express support  for it, according to several experts, including Lincoln biographer Ronald C. White Jr.; Michael Burlingame, a Lincoln scholar at the University of Illinois-Springfield; and Columbia University historian Eric Foner. 
As president, Lincoln did agree to a proposal that would have admitted New Mexico as a state, said Lincoln biographer James McPherson. So in that sense, he could be said to have supported the Compromise of 1850, in that New Mexico had opted to approve a slave code. On the other hand, McPherson said, no slaves were counted in New Mexico in the 1860 census, which indicates slavery had not taken hold there. 
Fugitive Slave Act 
Similarly, Lincoln as president held that the federal government needed to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act, mandating for the return of runaway slaves, given that it was the law of the land. But, McPherson noted, Lincoln wanted legislation to give alleged fugitive slaves a trial before they could be returned. 
""He did feel there was no choice but to defend the legality of the Fugitive Slave Act once it became law, and even said so in his first inaugural address -- but here some context is needed, too,"" said Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer. ""He refused to oppose so-called ‘personal liberty laws’ that were passed by northern states to justify disobedience to the Fugitive Slave Act. 
""So, in sum, Lincoln always opposed slavery,"" said James Cornelius, curator at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library & Museum. ""But he also held, privately and out loud, that federal law must be obeyed."" 
Our rating 
Ryan said Abraham Lincoln supported an agreement that allowed slavery in New Mexico ""and a law to return runaway slaves to their owners."" 
He goes too far. Lincoln backed an agreement that allowed New Mexico to decide whether it would allow slavery. And Lincoln held that the federal government needed to abide the return of runaway slaves, given that was the law of the land, but he didn’t support it. 
Ryan’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. That fits our definition for Half True.",/factchecks/2013/apr/21/paul-ryan/lincoln-backed-slavery-measures-us-rep-paul-ryan-s/

R.I. State Rep. Michael Chippendale says guns don't increase the risk of suicide because suicidal people will find a way to kill themselves
","
More than 60 percent of the 31,000 gun deaths in the United States each year result from suicide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
One of the arguments used by supporters of gun control is that restricting access to guns could prevent some of those suicides. 
Some gun-control opponents dispute that, arguing that suicidal people will simply find another way to kill themselves. 
Those opposite positions were expressed when WPRI-TV taped a debate April 12 on ""Newsmakers"" featuring two state representatives -- Republican Michael Chippendale of Foster and Democrat Linda Finn of Middletown. 
Finn said gun-related suicides are ""primarily young adults, young men having access to firearms and killing themselves."" 
""If an individual is under enough emotional or psychological distress where they’re going to commit suicide, the availability of a gun is not a factor,"" Chippendale responded. 
He went on to explain, ""There’s bridges to jump off. There are drugs to take. There are plenty of ways, if one is in such a state of mind to dispatch their own lives, where they will do it. The availability of a gun is not what makes a person commit suicide, mental illness is. A firearm is a tool."" 
We were interested in Chippendale's assertion that the availability of a gun is not a factor in whether a person commits suicide because suicidal people just find other ways to end their lives, a phenomenon researchers refer to as ""substitution."" 
Chippendale sent us to two studies to support his claim. 
The first, done in Australia and published in 2010 in the Medical Journal of Australia, compared suicide rates before and after the country instituted strict gun restrictions and a gun-buyback program. After one fifth of the guns were taken out of circulation, gun-related suicides decreased but suicides by hanging increased, suggesting that at least some people were switching to that method. (The low rate of gun use in Australia made it difficult to be definitive.)   
The other study was published in 1992 by the New England Journal of Medicine. Chippendale highlighted a chart saying that although having a gun in the home made it 4.8 times more likely that a successful suicide would occur, there were other factors such as whether someone was using illicit drugs, or had been hospitalized due to drinking, or was taking mental illness medication. But it didn’t address the substitution issue. 
The chief author, Dr. Arthur Kellermann, now a senior policy analyst at the Rand Corporation, said he published a more-relevant study in 1990 that compared suicide rates in Seattle and neighboring Vancouver, similar cities with different gun cultures. 
That analysis found that while the risk of gun suicide was more than twice as high in gun-friendly Seattle, that was offset by the fact that non-gun suicides were 1.5 times more common in Vancouver. 
""There is evidence of substitution,"" but it's far from universal, he said. It's mostly likely in cases where someone is hell-bent on killing themselves. ""For younger groups and suicides that are more impulsive, I think that ready access to a highly lethal means does make a difference. In many of those cases, if they survive the attempt, they are grateful they didn't die and have a chance at getting their act together."" 
In contrast to the few studies Chippendale offered to support his statement, we found several more that didn't. In addition, other suicide experts with whom we spoke said bluntly that Chippendale is wrong because suicide is usually an impulsive act, and having a gun available dramatically increases the chance that any attempt will be successful. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of those who use a gun die, compared with 3 percent to 6 percent of those who try by another means, according to various studies. Most people who survive one attempt don't try again. 
""If you are determined, you will eventually find a way to die. What people don't understand is for many suicidal people, that period of intense suicidality doesn't last that long,"" said Catherine Barber of the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center. 
Among people interviewed after they nearly died from a suicide attempt, 71 percent said they had only felt suicidal for one hour or less before they tried to take their lives and only 13 percent said it was a day or more. 
And other data suggest that most people don't look for other means of suicide if a gun isn't handy. 
A soon-to-be-released Harvard study found that in 16 ""high-gun"" states where 50 percent of the households have a firearm, the total number of suicides in 2008 and 2009 was 11,889. In six ""low-gun"" states with a comparable population, there were half as many suicides -- 6,038. The reason: the rate of firearm suicides was a whopping 77 percent lower than in the ""high-gun"" states. 
The same trend is clear in earlier data from 1999 to 2007. 
And it's not because people are less-prone to suicide in ""low-gun"" states. In fact, the estimated number of suicide attempts was 23 percent higher in the low-gun states. 
So, Barber asked, if Chippendale were correct, ""why wouldn’t we simply see more non-firearm suicides in the low-gun states and roughly equal suicide rates across the two groups?"" But you don't. 
Other studies also suggested that Chippendale is wrong. 
In Israel, the Israeli Defense Force had a high suicide rate that dropped by 40 percent once the troops were prohibited from taking their guns with them when they went home for the weekend. 
In Great Britain, where putting your head in the oven was once a common way to kill yourself, the suicide rate dropped by a third when the country started using a less-toxic form of natural gas. 
In Sri Lanka, where the preferred method of suicide was poisoning with pesticide, the rate dropped by half once the country switched in 1995 to pesticides that are less toxic to humans. 
If Chippendale were correct, the suicide rate in those countries wouldn’t have gone down because these were people intent on suicide, Barber said. 
Said David N. Miller, a professor of psychology at the State University of New York at Albany and and president-elect of the American Association of Suicidology: ""Restricting the means of suicide in one area (for example, restricting access to guns) does not inevitably lead to an increase in suicide by other methods, as the politician suggests. In fact, this often does not occur."" 
Our ruling 
State Rep. Michael Chippendale said, ""If an individual is under enough emotional or psychological distress where they’re going to commit suicide, the availability of a gun is not a factor."" 
There is evidence that such substitution takes place, but it is limited and contradicted by other data. 
Most experts told us the real issue is impulsiveness. Some people determined to kill themselves are locked into that decision and will find another method if a gun isn't handy. 
But research suggests that most suicide attempts are not the result of such premeditation. Their determination is spur-of-the-moment. Thus, the presence or absence of a firearm can play a big role in whether the person is successful. 
Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

"['Oregon', 'Public Health', 'Water', 'Clean Water Portland']","
Do numbers put Multnomah Co. on par with 15th lowest cavity rate in the country?
","
  
Portland residents will vote in May on whether to add fluoride to the city’s drinking water. This is a long-running, divisive and emotional issue for people on both sides. Supporters say fluoridated water is the best way to strengthen teeth, especially for vulnerable children who lack access to regular dental care. Opponents say we should leave the city’s pristine drinking water alone.  
Opponents claim supporters are using misleading figures to make a case for fluoridating water in Portland. For example, the percentage of children who had or have a cavity is much higher in the rest of Oregon than it is in the Portland-metro area -- 70 percent compared with 54 percent among children, according to a 2007 state survey.  
""In fact, if you compare the Portland Metro area to the CDC’s statewide cavity rates fluoridation supporters rely upon, the Portland Metro area would actually rank as having the 15th lowest cavity rate in the U.S,"" reads a yellow flier distributed by Clean Water Portland, the key campaign opposed to Measure 26-151.  
  
Obviously, a metro region is not a state, and it feels sloppy to mix the two in ranking anything. Still, we were surprised enough by the claim to want to dig deeper. Does the Portland area already boast enviable oral health statistics? Are the numbers cited even comparable?  
The Clean Water Portland campaign cites Oregon’s 2007 Smile Survey in part to back up its claim.  
The percentage of first-, second- and third-graders in Multnomah County, which includes Portland, who had or have a cavity was 56.3. The percentage in Clackamas and Washington counties was 52.5. Combined, the percentage was 54, as shown on page 12 of the report. Statewide, the percentage was 64 and outside the tri-county area, 70 percent.  
Now, how does the Clean Water Campaign determine that Multnomah County is comparable to the No. 15 spot nationally? Here, we turn to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as does the campaign.  
The CDC posts all sorts of statistics related to dental health, including what the organization calls ""experience with caries,"" also known as having had a cavity. The percentages for children are broken down by elementary grades, and by participating state.  
Opponents say that the Portland-metro percentage of 54 is close to the percentage in New York state, which is 54.1. Opponents say since New York has the 15th lowest ""experience with caries,"" the tri-county area must do pretty well on the cavity front, too.  
Here’s the problem with that kind of thinking. In 2007, Multnomah County was at 56.3 percent, counting three grades of students. The New York number comes from 2001-2003, and it’s limited to third-graders. Even more important than all of that is this: Seven states do not report the information and of the remaining ones that do, the years cited are all over the map, some as dated as 1998-99.  
In other words, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not rank New York as having the 15th lowest cavity rate in the United States. There’s no baseline year. Subsequently, it’s even more unlikely that anyone could describe the Portland-metro area as having the 15th lowest cavity rate in the United States.  
""You cannot directly compare state data to city data,"" unless it’s contained within a state, wrote CDC spokeswoman Linda S. Orgain in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. ""We also do not generally compare states to other states in (the oral health surveillance system) because we have different time periods for each state.""  
Shanie Mason, oral health unit manager for the Oregon Health Authority, echoed the sentiment. ""We have never compared to other cities. We have only compared ourselves against neighboring states with a similar methodology,"" she said.  
We understand, however, that voters may want to get at the larger point behind the claim: How does Portland and Multnomah County fare when assessing cavities in children?  
Again, in 2007, about 56.3 percent of Multnomah County children in grades 1, 2 and 3 had a cavity, compared with 64 percent statewide. Preliminary figures for 2011-13 show numbers have dropped. The percentage of students in all three grades who had a cavity is 52. In Multnomah County for all three grades, it is 50.8. (For third-graders only, the new percentage statewide is 57.5 percent, down from 66.3 in 2006. We offer the various numbers to give readers a sense of how they differ based on the grade or grades included.)  
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is not aware of city-specific data for comparison purposes, said Orgain. She also said the most recent national statistic for cavities in children is from 1999-2004, and it was 53.2 percent for children ages 6 to 8 years old. That provides a national statistic by which readers could measure the county’s more recent percentage, but keep in mind it is old.  
Mason, who hopes to release the 2012 survey before the May 21 election, said one of the reasons the tri-county area does better than the rest of the state is that ""Multnomah County has a pretty strong oral health infrastructure, and has for a much longer period of time than any other areas of the state.""  
Physical therapist Kellie Barnes, a parent and volunteer with the Clean Water Campaign, defends the statement, saying that they were utterly transparent in telling voters the comparison was of the county to another state. Barnes also said fluoride supporters have repeatedly used the CDC state figures to rank Oregon, even with the varying years and ages tested. 
The larger point, Barnes said, is that fluoride advocates should not use statewide cavity statistics to indicate a dental crisis in Multnomah County or in Portland.  
But her arguments don’t make the statement any more correct. It’s certainly accurate to say that Multnomah County generally has better cavity numbers than the rest of the state. However, fluoride opponents went further, and said the Portland-metro area ""would actually rank as having the 15th lowest cavity rate in the U.S.""  
The numbers relied on by fluoride opponents do not show that New York has the 15th lowest cavity rate in the country. There is no national ranking of state cavity statistics because not all states have reported numbers, states may differ on sampling, and states report numbers for different years.  
Oregon’s numbers for Multnomah County include three grades, compared with one grade for the aged New York statistic cited. Public health experts we interviewed say it is not appropriate to compare a county percentage to the percentage of another state. We rule the statement False.

Barack Obama says a “wide majority of NRA households"" supported gun legislation
","
After the Senate failed to advance an amendment that would expand federal requirements for background checks on gun purchasers, President Barack Obama took to the White House’s Rose Garden to denounce the vote, calling it ""a pretty shameful day for Washington."" 
Flanked by relatives of some of the slain children from Newtown, Conn., and assassination survivor Gabby Giffords, Obama emphasized how broadly Americans support expanded background checks for gun purchases. 
At several points in his remarks, Obama invoked his gun-policy adversary, the National Rifle Association. ""To the wide majority of NRA households who supported this legislation, you need to let your leadership and lobbyists in Washington know they didn’t represent your views on this one,"" Obama said. 
We found two independent polls have attempted to take the pulse of the NRA’s membership on universal background checks, the linchpin of both the failed compromise amendment sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa, and the underlying bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. Here’s how the data stacks up. 
• One poll was done by CBS News and the New York Times. The survey, conducted Jan. 11-15, 2013, found that 85 percent of those living in a household with an NRA member favored background checks for all potential gun buyers. 
• The other survey, by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, was taken Feb. 13-18, 2013. It found that ""people in NRA households overwhelmingly favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks: 74 percent favor this proposal while just 26 percent are opposed."" 
These results verify that rank-and-file NRA members and those who live with them favor universal background checks by margins of between 74 percent and 85 percent. 
Still, there’s a problem with Obama’s phrasing. He said that a ""wide majority of NRA households ... supported this legislation."" While the percentages supporting universal background checks in the latter two polls qualify as a ""wide majority"" in our book, each of these polls were taken before either of the two relevant pieces of legislation were filed in the Senate. Reid’s underlying bill was submitted on March 21, while the Manchin-Toomey amendment was submitted on April 11. 
So while the polls do demonstrate strong support for background checks -- a key element of both Senate measures -- it’s a bit of a stretch to say that NRA members polled supported ""this legislation."" The legislation in question hadn’t even been introduced yet. 
Our ruling 
Obama said a ""wide majority of NRA households ... supported this legislation."" Two fully independent polls showed that NRA members or households support expanded background checks, but the polls couldn’t have asked about the ""legislation"" Obama referred to because those measures had not been introduced yet.

Immigrants would get free cell phones under new proposal, bloggers claim
","
Have you heard of Obamaphones, cellphones for people on welfare? Now there’s a new catchphrase going around conservative circles: Marcophones. 
It’s a hard jab at U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who’s supporting immigration legislation put forward by a small group of senators called the Gang of Eight. 
The group recently released a draft of the legislation. Now bloggers have seized on the bill to make the claim that it gives free cell phones to illegal immigrants. 
""Move Over ‘Obama Phone,’ Say ‘Hola!’ to the Marco Rubio Immigration Phone, AKA MarcoPhone,"" said The Shark Tank, a conservative South Florida website. 
""According to the newly filed bill, immigrants who are allowed to enter the United States under a work visa, will be ‘granted’ a taxpayer funded cellular phone,"" it continued. 
""Immigration bill contains Marcophones,"" repeated the conservative website Breitbart. 
Soon, the story was zipping around the Internet, in one case even sent out by a staff member of U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who opposes the legislation. 
It prompted Marco Rubio to take to Twitter in protest of the rumors. ""Report that claims #immigrationreform gives immigrants free cell phones is false & reckless,"" he said. 
We were immediately dubious that the legislation said any such thing. The old ""Obamaphones"" rumor, for example, has been widely debunked. President Barack Obama never started a program to give out free cell phones to his supporters. Instead, he inherited a longstanding federal program that subsidizes phone service for the poor, including cellphone service. And the Federal Communications Commission under Obama’s watch has moved to put more restrictions on the program to prevent fraud and waste. 
So it was an easy call to take a look at the legislation and check out the ""Marcophones"" rumor for ourselves. 
One quick clue that the rumor was off-base: The section that allegedly authorizes the free phones, Section 1107, is part of the bill’s Title I, which has to do with border security. 
The bill authorizes a program to ""improve emergency communications in the Southwest Border region."" It creates grants for people who can prove they work and live in the region and are ""at greater risk of border violence due to the lack of cellular service at his or her residence or business and his or her proximity to the Southwest border."" 
The bill specifically mentions grants should be for satellite phones that ""provide access to 911 service and are equipped with global positioning services."" 
After the blogosphere lit up with the rumor, Rubio said in a statement that the program was put forward in response to the death of an Arizona rancher, Robert Krentz. Intruders attacked Krentz on his property near the U.S.-Mexico border in 2010. His murder remains unsolved. 
""Attempts to track Krentz's location using GPS from his cell phone were unsuccessful. Verizon had trouble getting a ‘ping' signal possibly due to sparcity of cell towers in the area,"" said a report from News 4 Tucson. 
In the weeks after Krentz’s death, then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., sent letters to the major wireless carriers asking them to improve cell phone service in the border area. 
""It is evident that the lack of reliable electronic communications is a factor in the growing public safety problem faced by area residents,"" Giffords wrote on April 9, 2010. ""It also contributed to a delay in the search for Mr. Krentz once he was reported missing and in the coordination of an immediate hunt for his killer who was able to escape into Mexico."" 
PolitiFact reached Javier Manjarres, managing editor of the Shark Tank blog. He said the blog highlighted the communications grants because the language of the bill seemed ambiguous. 
""Obviously, the bill doesn’t say only immigrants are getting them. We’re saying it because, hey, it could happen down the road, and the bill is so vague,"" he said. 
It’s true that the bill authorizes the program in broad outlines and doesn’t set out specific criteria. But the bill also says the program will be administered by the secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the governors of the Southwest border states. This means the secretary would have the authority to set up eligibility criteria. And that criteria would have to promote the goal of border security, not welfare for new immigrants. 
Our ruling 
Bloggers charge that new immigration legislation includes ""a taxpayer funded cellular phone"" for new immigrants. Their evidence is based on something else entirely: a public safety program aimed at beefing up border security. 
The bill includes grants aimed at helping American ranchers and others in remote locations along the border get satellite phone service so they can be in touch with authorities. And Rubio can point to a well-documented case in which a rancher was killed on his property, and authorities said better phone service would have made a difference in speeding up their response to the case.

Rauner veers off course in claiming Pritzker proposed a mileage tax
","In his re-election bid, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has sought to convince Illinois taxpayers that electing his Democratic opponent J.B. Pritzker spells trouble for their bottom line. In a recent campaign ad, the first-term incumbent doubled down on that narrative with several claims about Pritzker’s tax plan. The 30-second spot features a woman identified as Denise Smith who describes herself as a lifelong Illinoisan who says she may leave Illinois if Pritzker is elected because of his tax policies. While the ad contains no direct narration from the campaign, it features the following text: JB PRITZKER’S TAX PLAN
INCOME TAX HIKE
NEW TAX PER MILE YOU DRIVE
WITH GOVERNMENT TRACKING DEVICE   Rauner has long maintained policies Pritzker has said he supports would sock the middle class with an income tax hike. Last winter, we rated that claim Mostly False.  Rauner’s mileage tax hit, on the other hand, is new. But the evidence isn’t in his favor there, either. Most of the dollars Illinois puts toward road work come from a 19-cent-per-gallon tax drivers pay at the gas pump. But as cars become ever more fuel-efficient, fill-ups get less frequent, and that translates into less money collected by the state to fix roads. Some states have responded to the spread of hybrid and electric cars by launching experiments that study ways to record and tax miles traveled instead of gallons purchased. Part of the theory behind this is that electric cars, hybrids and other newer vehicles put the same wear and tear on highways as do gas guzzlers, but pay little to nothing for road repairs because their owners buy less fuel. Last January, during an interview with the Daily Herald editorial board, Pritzker said a vehicle mileage tax was an idea worth testing, but didn’t commit to any wide-scale implementation. Here’s what he said at the time about a VMT, or vehicle miles traveled tax, according to a video recording of his appearance posted by the newspaper: ""You talked about a gas tax … We're challenged to come up with the dollars that we need for our highway system and for our roads. So in some states, they have done tests recently for a VMT tax ... It's only fair if you're on a road and traveling on that road that you should pay your fair share on the road like everybody else is paying. So I think it's something we should look at. We have to be careful about how it gets implemented and that's why it should only be a test at this point. I guess I'm letting you know that I recognize the challenge that we have in coming up with the dollars for our roads, particularly in that gas tax arena, and that we've got to look for different ways to fund it."" Pritzker said much the same at a Downstate event in August attended by both governor candidates during which Rauner contended the Democrat had in fact proposed a mileage tax. ""What I said is there are tests that have been done on this (tax) and I think we've got to look for how we're going to pay for infrastructure in the state,"" said Pritzker, according to the Decatur Herald & Review. ""It's not anything definitive."" When we reached out to Rauner’s campaign to ask when and where they’d heard Pritzker propose a mileage tax with a government tracking device, spokesman Justin Giorgio did not directly answer. ""Pritzker has expressed support for a test program,"" Giorgio wrote in an email. ""And in every other case, there has been a government tracking device."" Likewise, Rauner chose his words a little more carefully during a debate last week televised on NBC 5. ""He was on the record, proposing, saying we all should look at a driving tax,"" Rauner asserted at one point. So neither Rauner nor his spokesman now go as far as the campaign’s ad to contend Pritzker has actually proposed a mileage tax as part of his tax plan, let alone put forth a specific method for taxing those miles. As for Giorgio’s suggestion that all other pilot programs have required a ""government tracking device,"" that is as misleading as it is sinister sounding. Oregon launched a permanent but voluntary mileage tax program in 2015. Participants, who are reimbursed state fuel tax for paying the mileage tax instead, can choose from multiple options to track their miles including a plug-in device that records mileage but does not track location. A total of nine states have run or are planning pilot programs to explore the possibility of taxing mileage, although only Oregon has implemented fees so far. Other states have also given participants a variety of choices when it came to recording their miles, including some that involve no tracking device—GPS-enabled or otherwise. California, for instance, conducted a nine-month study in which participants were allowed to sign up for odometer checks or purchase permits for a set number of days in lieu of more high-tech options. Rauner’s ad says ""Pritzker’s tax plan"" includes a ""new tax per mile you drive with government tracking device."" But Pritzker hasn’t endorsed any plan as of yet when it comes to measuring and taxing miles driven and Rauner in a televised debate last week appeared to back away from directly claiming otherwise, although his ad is still running. Pritzker has simply said it’s an idea worth exploring as other states test the concept, given the erosion in collections from the gas tax long relied on to pay for road upkeep. And he has said nothing about a tracking device, which is only one of several options employed in mileage tracking tests conducted in other states.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Missouri', 'Cort  VanOstran ']","
Has Ann Wagner held any town halls in her district?
","Is it true that one congresswoman has never held a ""town hall"" with her constituents during the three terms she’s served? In a press release on Aug. 21, Democrat Cort VanOstran called out Republican Rep. Ann Wagner for not responding to his demands to have a debate and tied it in with her unavailability to constituents: ""Rep. Ann Wagner, a three-term incumbent, has never held a town hall in the Second District."" VanOstran is trying to unseat Wagner in Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District, which encompasses much of St. Louis County and stretches as far out as O’Fallon. Given the use of the word ""never,"" we found VanOstran’s contention surprising — three terms is a long time to have never held a town hall. We decided to see if this was true. We began by looking at the Merriam-Webster Dictionary definition for ""town hall."" It states that a town hall is ""an event at which a public official or political candidate addresses an audience by answering questions posed by individual members."" We reached out to VanOstran’s campaign for their evidence. Campaign manager Claire Botnick said the VanOstran camp simply called Wagner’s camp to ask about it, and a representative from her office said Wagner has never held a public in-person town hall. The Wagner campaign declined an offer to comment on the record, so we examined the information we could find on our own. Wagner has held multiple town halls conducted via telephone (known as tele-town halls), according to her social media accounts, coverage in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and St. Louis Public Radio and an email exchange with one of her constituents. However, finding in-person town halls conducted by Wagner was more difficult. A quick search of the term ""town hall"" on both Wagner’s Facebook and Twitter accounts showed eight events where Wagner described herself at a town hall. But all of these events were held by private companies, where she was speaking to employees. We asked whether the events were public or private and whether Wagner addressed questions from the audience as described in the Merriam-Webster definition. According to company spokespersons and social media posts: • In five cases, Wagner held ask-and-answer meetings for employees only: at Monsanto, MetLife, Express Scripts, Charter Communications and RGA. • At Maritz Global Events, Wagner didn’t take questions, meaning the company event doesn’t fit the definition of a town hall. • Equifax couldn’t confirm whether questions were asked, but a news release noted a ""town hall session"" with Wagner after a ribbon-cutting. It is unclear whether that event was open to the public. • United Health Group didn’t respond to PolitiFact. Beyond social media, we scrolled through articles about public events attended by Wagner that might have resembled town halls. We found no examples of events that fit the traditional definition of town halls. Bottom line: We could not find evidence of an in-person, public town hall where Wagner took questions from constituents. At most, she has held town halls that were limited to a private group of employees at a specific company. University of Alabama political scientist Joe Smith told PolitiFact Texas that he doesn’t view closed-to-the-public events with a company’s employees to be genuine town halls. The employees who attend ""know that their employer has arranged for and endorsed the visit, and that therefore assertive questions are not welcome,"" Smith said. Duquesne University professor Mike Dillon agreed. ""The term ‘town hall’ implies an event is open to the entire community and that competing ideas will be welcomed and discussed,"" Dillon said. VanOstran said Wagner has never held a town hall in the 2nd District during her tenure as congresswoman. She has held telephone-based town halls, as well as private events for particular companies’ employees. But experts say that a town hall traditionally involves a public official inviting any constituent to gather in a public space and ask him or her questions. So VanOstran has a point.

Molinaro makes claims about Cuomo's MTA record
","With the general election campaign in full swing, the attacks have begun as Republican Marc Molinaro tries to unseat Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. During a news conference in Manhattan, Molinaro criticized Cuomo’s stewardship of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is responsible for New York City buses, subways, and commuter rail lines into Connecticut, Long Island and southeastern New York. Molinaro explained how he would do things differently than the incumbent. ""We’re going to start by, instead of focusing on vanity projects and the colors of tiles in Midtown Tunnel, or by the way, stealing money from the MTA and sending it upstate for projects that have nothing to do with transit, we’re going to focus the New York state taxpayers’ dollars on signal switches, and subway cars, on platform rehab and accessibility,"" Molinaro said. Is Molinaro right? Did the governor steal money from the MTA to send upstate? Background The MTA carries 8.6 million riders on an average weekday and had an operating budget of $13 billion in 2017. Riders frequently face delays and deal with overcrowded trains and trains that break down, putting the transit authority in the spotlight. Molinaro ties his claim to a story published in the New York Daily News in July 2017. The newspaper reported that the MTA in 2016 had been instructed by the Cuomo administration to send a $4.9 million check to the Olympic Regional Development Authority. The authority’s  finances had suffered because of a warm winter. The authority operates or manages upstate ski areas at Whiteface, Gore, and Belleayre mountains and the Lake Placid Olympic facilities. The Molinaro campaign provided only a link to a related news story as evidence of his claim. Direct transfer The state Division of Budget does not dispute that the MTA directly transferred $4.9 million to the Olympic authority, said spokesman Morris Peters. The state routinely charges state authorities for services that state government personnel provide them, and it has done so for years. Since at least 2010, the state has charged the MTA around $5 million annually for services it provided the authority, as it does for 13 other authorities, Peters said. Section 2975 of state law allows for ""recovery of state governmental costs from public authorities and public benefit corporations."" The state can collect money for staff time, equipment and facilities, and other services the state provides to support authorities. Under the law, the money is to be collected by the state treasurer and credited to the state’s general fund, though other appropriations can be made by the budget director. A portion of these payments is to be used to fund the authorities budget office.   The MTA owed the state $4.9 million in 2016, and the Olympic authority needed the money soon because of the warm winter, Peters said. Sending the $4.9 million to the state’s general fund, so the state could then send it to the troubled ski areas, would create a delay, he said.   These types of direct payments have happened for years. In more than a dozen instances since 2010, authorities were told to send their payment to another entity to deal with a critical budget need, instead of sending it to the state’s general fund.     ""It’s not the most transparent budget move in the world,"" said Rachael Fauss, a senior research analyst with Reinvent Albany, an organization focused on transparency in government. Though it’s ""just not great policy,"" Fauss said, ""it’s legal, it’s allowed.""  The Office of the State Comptroller, which reports on state finances, and is mentioned in the state law authorizing these payments, declined to comment on the claim. A spokesman referred us to an audit of the Olympic authority that was published two years ahead of the $4.9 million transaction. The audit recommended better cash management. The MTA also declined to comment on the claim. The transfer of $4.9 million directly from the MTA to an upstate authority that manages ski resorts raised eyebrows when it was initially reported, because of the MTA’s financial and operational problems and because it prompted questions about whether it was a sound budget practice. Molinaro’s claim that the money was sent from the MTA to the Olympic redevelopment authority for non-transit projects is correct. State law, however, allows the state to recover money from authorities for the work that state agencies do on behalf of the authorities, contradicting Molinaro’s claim that Cuomo was ""stealing"" from the MTA. What's more, the $4.9 million could have been collected by the state regardless of who was governor. We rate his claim False.  ",/factchecks/2018/sep/21/marcus-molinaro/molinaro-makes-claims-about-cuomos-mta-record/

Fact-checking a Josh Hawley video that highlights insurers' donations to Claire McCaskill
","In Missouri’s high-profile U.S. Senate race, voters are seeing dueling ads from the two candidates. The first volley came when incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill released an ad (embedded here) that challenged her Republican opponent, state attorney general Josh Hawley, over health care. In the ad, McCaskill discusses her own struggle with breast cancer and warns that a lawsuit Hawley has signed onto threatens provisions within the Affordable Care Act that enable people with pre-existing conditions to get health insurance. Then, on Sept. 19, Hawley’s campaign took a portion of that ad and threw it back on McCaskill. The Hawley camp released a 15-second video that begins with McCaskill talking to the camera, saying, ""The insurance companies already have too many senators on their side."" A narrator responds: ""What a hypocrite. Claire McCaskill receives the second-most contributions from insurance companies in the entire Senate.""  We found the Hawley campaign has a point about McCaskill's support from insurers, but it requires some caveats so voters have the full picture. The visual in the video showing McCaskill at No. 2 on the contribution list comes from this page in the OpenSecrets.org database, a widely cited money-in-politics resource published by the Center for Responsive Politics. It shows the top recipients of donations from the insurance sector among senators in the 2017-18 campaign cycle. By the time we looked at the OpenSecrets page, it had been updated with new data that pushed McCaskill down by one slot to third. We won’t quibble with a third-place ranking as opposed to a second-place ranking; the underlying claim is that McCaskill ranks high among all senators.  However, a closer look at the methodology that went into creating the list in question brings up a couple of important points to note. • The OpenSecrets data for donations doesn’t just include health insurers; it includes all insurers, including life, property and car insurance companies. The Hawley camp argues that the video uses McCaskill’s exact language — ""the insurance companies"" — and that she did not specify health insurance companies. However, we believe anyone who sees the first three-quarters of McCaskill’s ad would clearly believe she was referring to health insurers, because that’s what the entire ad is about. • Because the 2018 list represents a snapshot in time, it doesn’t support the notion that McCaskill leads ""the entire Senate"" in donations from the industry. Generally speaking, senators take in significantly more money from donors during the one-out-of-three election cycles in which they are up for reelection, as McCaskill is now. This essentially shrinks the pool of incumbents actively raising money for an election. Yes, there are 100 senators, but there are only 35 seats up for election this November, and 32 incumbents running. Why does that matter? Of the top 10 senators on the OpenSecrets list, all are up for re-election except one, Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. In addition, McCaskill’s contributions from insurance companies have varied depending on what time period you look at. If you look at the 2014 and 2016 campaign cycles, McCaskill didn't rank in the top 20 either time. Even in her prior reelection cycle, 2012, McCaskill ranked 19th among senators, and if you add in non-incumbents running for the Senate that cycle, she fell out of the top 20 entirely. Meanwhile, McCaskill’s haul so far cycle — $295,338 — is a fraction of what four Republicans received in the 2016 cycle (Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas, Rob Portman of Ohio, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania) and what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., received from the industry in the 2014 cycle. • Much of the money used to determine the 2018 rankings doesn’t come from ""insurance companies."" Donors on the OpenSecrets list don’t only include political action committees but also individual donors who have listed an employer. So a donation from a low-level employee or their spouse would count in this tally as coming from ""the industry."" If you look at related campaign-finance data, both sides can claim some vindication. When we asked the Center for Responsive Politics if they could drill down further to look only at health insurers’ donations, they told us that from 2013 to 2018, McCaskill received a combined $413,528 from donors related to the ""accident and health insurers"" category as well a separate category, health maintenance organizations. By contrast, Hawley, who was not a federal candidate for much of that time span, received just $5,400. On the other hand, if you look at the percentage of donations McCaskill received from the ""insurance category,"" it’s pretty modest. She has received $295,338 from all insurance sources in the 2018 campaign cycle, but she’s raised in excess of $20 million from all sources as of this writing. So insurance-related donations account for just 1.4 percent of her contributions, casting doubt on Hawley’s implication that she’s controlled by the industry. Hawley said that ""Claire McCaskill receives the second-most contributions from insurance companies in the entire Senate."" This isn't a perfect reflection of her standing among senators in terms of health insurance contributions. This ranking is based all types of insurers, not just health insurers. But with current contributions, she ranks third among current senators for insurance-related donations during the 2018 campaign cycle.

Martha McSally's exaggerates Kyrsten Sinema votes on ICE funding
","Immigration enforcement is a top issue for the border state of Arizona, and one that Republican congresswoman Martha McSally has elevated during her campaign for the U.S. Senate. In an interview with Fox News, McSally said that Democratic rival and U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema voted to weaken the federal agency responsible for executing immigration laws within the United States, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ""This is a dangerous agenda coming out of the Democrats, and again my opponent voted to cut ICE. ... I support ICE and my opponent voted for cuts to ICE, voted not to support the Department of Homeland Security,"" McSally said in the interview that aired Sept. 16. ""She is associated with this dangerous agenda, don’t be fooled by it. And that’s a real contrast in this race as well."" McSally is on the House Homeland Security Committee and chairs the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee. Is it true that Sinema ""voted to cut ICE""? There’s truth to McSally’s claim, but it leaves out important details. • Sinema voted to shift funds from ICE to other agencies. • However, Sinema also voted to increase ICE’s funding in fiscal year 2018 and, like McSally, voted in favor of a resolution supporting ICE. • Sinema said abolishing ICE ""isn’t realistic and it doesn’t make any sense."" McSally’s campaign said Sinema was among Democrats who voted in favor of an amendment to an appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018. That amendment, sponsored by Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., sought to reduce ICE funding by $100 million and give that money to the U.S. Coast Guard. (The amendment failed.) Correa argued on the House floor that the Coast Guard should use the money for additional ships to interdict drugs coming to the United States by sea. Despite record-breaking efforts against drug trafficking, the Coast Guard’s cocaine seizures accounted for less than 10 percent of all attempted shipments, Correa said. The $100 million represented ""additional support for our border security, our high seas,"" Correa said. He was responding to Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, who argued that the Coast Guard program was already robust and ICE money should go toward the detention of immigrants. Sinema’s campaign argued that the $100 million redirection would have reduced an overall increase in ICE funding, but not necessarily cut it. That September, Sinema also voted in favor of a motion introduced by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, to recommit a bill to the House Appropriations Committee. The intention was to get the committee to amend the bill by allocating $2.4 billion to FEMA’s National Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund. About $840 million would have come from ICE’s budget and $1.6 billion from U.S. Customs and Border Protection's allocation for border barriers. (The motion failed.) Jackson Lee argued that instead of funding a border wall and ICE detention facilities, more money was needed for pre-disaster funding, especially in light of Hurricane Harvey's aftermath in Texas and Louisiana. ""We do not need another 10,000 beds in ICE detention centers; but we do need more than 10,000 beds in evacuation shelters,"" said Jackson Lee. In spite of those votes, Sinema’s spokeswoman Helen Hare said McSally’s claim ignores a big part of the story. Sinema voted in favor of a 10 percent funding increase for ICE, compared to fiscal year 2017. Sinema over her years in Congress also has voted in favor of other appropriation bills funding ICE, her campaign said. Moreover, Sinema was one of 18 Democrats who voted in favor of a July resolution stating explicit support for ICE officers and personnel and denouncing calls to abolish the agency. Most Democrats voted ""present."" That measure came to the floor as Republican House leaders sought to put Democrats on the record regarding their position on ICE. Sinema in July also told azfamily.com that ""abolishing ICE isn’t realistic and it doesn’t make any sense."" While the agency removed criminal immigrants, Sinema said, ""most Americans would agree that we could use some reform."" McSally said Sinema ""voted to cut ICE."" McSally’s evidence are votes Sinema cast on measures seeking to take funds away from ICE to give them to FEMA and the Coast Guard. But McSally’s claim ignores Sinema’s broader voting record. Sinema has also voted to increase funds for ICE and cast a vote supporting ICE and denouncing calls to eliminate the agency. McSally’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

No, Christine Blasey Ford's brother isn't linked to Fusion GPS, Russia investigation
","Christine Blasey Ford’s brother’s job history from 14 years ago has been pulled into widespread internet speculation about Ford’s accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Ford, a California professor, went public with her accusations against Kavanaugh earlier this week, saying he sexually assaulted her at a party while the two were in high school in the early 1980s.

""I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,"" Kavanaugh said in a statement. ""I did not do this back in high school or at any time."" YourNewsWire.com points to Ralph Blasey’s time at the law firm BakerHostetler from 1989 to 2004 as evidence that Ford is somehow linked to the Russia investigation.

""Ford has a brother, Ralph Blasey, who worked for BakerHostetler, a law firm that retained Fusion GPS, the infamous DC company that produced the unverified Steele dossier on President Donald Trump and Russia, sparking the Russia investigation,"" the release states, linking to YourNewsWire.com. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This theory that somehow Ford is linked to the Russia investigation through her brother’s old job comes from the fact that in 2013, nine years after Blasey left BakerHostetler, the firm hired Fusion GPS, a consulting firm, to assist with a Russian money-laundering investigation. In 2015, Fusion GPS subcontracted with Christopher Steele, a British intelligence officer to produce the Russian dossier. Fusion GPS has said the two cases were unrelated. In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Ford’s lawyers said she had ""been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats.""

Ford’s brother, Ralph Blasey, worked for a law firm that worked with Fusion GPS nine years after he left the company. Fusion GPS’s work on the Russian dossier began more than a decade after Blasey left BakerHostetler.

NJ House candidates fight over 2017 tax bill
","What do you call it when both candidates were against the sweeping 2017 tax bill in Congress, yet one now criticizes the other for wanting to get rid of parts of it? Let’s call it New Jersey. This spat involves the method with which either candidate in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District would change the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and whether one of them would get rid of the parts that people like. U.S. Rep. Leonard Lance, a Republican, says Democratic challenger Tom Malinowski wants to repeal the 2017 tax law, which despite some distasteful parts also ""includes vital tax incentives"" for distressed areas of New Jersey communities. Lance made the claim on Sept. 10, issuing a statement that ""while Malinowski speaks in glowing terms of ‘facilitating economic revitalization,’ he fails to tell voters he supports a full repeal of the 2017 tax law, which includes vital tax incentives to revitalize the city of Phillipsburg."" Phillipsburg, with a riverfront corridor on the border with Pennsylvania that city officials have long wanted to improve, is among the communities hoping to benefit from an economic development provision in the tax law. Phillipsburg ""will benefit greatly from the Opportunity Zones law,"" town Council President Robert Fulper is quoted as saying in Lance’s statement. Malinowski, Fulper says in the statement, ""wants to throw the baby out with the bath water and eliminate a program that is truly doing good for our community."" Does he? The campaign of Malinowski, a former assistant secretary of State for democracy, human rights and labor in President Barack Obama’s administration, says this is patently false. So what do Lance and his supporters base the claim on? Before we get to the basis for the claim, it’s worth noting a bit of irony. Lance voted against this very piece of tax legislation, one of only 12 Republican House members to do so. At the time, he said he voted no ""because it significantly reduces the ability of New Jerseyans to deduct state and local taxes, a provision that has been in the code since 1913."" This new cap on ""SALT,"" a popular acronym for the taxes, is making some homeowners angry in states with high real estate prices and high property taxes. In the past, they could deduct all their local property taxes from their incomes when figuring out their federal income tax obligation. Now, they can only deduct up to $10,000 for all state and local taxes, or $5,000 apiece if married but filing separately. ""Also, as a deficit hawk, I do not favor adding $1.5 trillion to the national debt,"" Lance said when voting no. Every House Democrat voted no, too, with many saying the tax cuts in the legislation tilted too heavily to wealthy Americans. But Lance was pleased with parts of the bill, nonetheless. These included a new preferential tax treatment on investment in economically distressed areas known as Opportunity Zones. As a result, New Jersey designated and the federal government in the spring approved 169 census tracts as Opportunity Zones. Despite Lance’s vote on the overall tax bill, he was an original cosponsor of an earlier measure to create Opportunity Zones, and it got folded into the final tax package. It is not unusual to oppose a multi-part bill while liking some components. But if Congress were to repeal the entire tax package now, the Opportunity Zone program, important to New Jersey communities, could end, Lance says. Yet he claimed in his Sept. 10 statement that his challenger would do just that: repeal the entire bill. ""Leonard isn't advocating for the repeal of the tax bill (and therefore opportunity zones),"" Lance’s campaign manager, Jim Hilk, told us in an email. ""Tom Malinowski is."" Asked for support for that claim, Hilk sent PolitiFact three pieces of information. One was to a tweet from the Communications Workers of America, or CWA, New Jersey organization, posted from the union’s leadership conference in July. The tweet quoted Malinowski saying, ""I want to be part of a majority that will fight for workers, for a $15/hr minimum wage, and will fight to repeal the GOP tax law."" ""I want to be part of a majority that will fight for workers, for a $15/hr minimum wage, and will fight to repeal the GOP tax law."" NJ-07 candidate Tom @Malinowski addresses the CWA Leadership Conference on his vision to fight for working families in Congress. pic.twitter.com/mjPAys9yHF Another link was to a statement issued by Malinowski’s campaign on Aug. 24. In it, the Democrat said, ""In New Jersey we’ve chosen to invest in the things that matter to us, like good schools and affordable healthcare, and Congressional Republicans designed their tax bill to hurt us for making those choices. The only way to repeal that tax bill and restore the SALT deduction is to replace the Republican majority in the Congress."" Note the word ""repeal,"" Lance’s campaign points out. The third link was to a story in Insider NJ, a website that covers political news. The story was on the opening of Malinowski’s campaign headquarters in May and noted that he was surrounded by well-wishers including U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, a Democrat from New Jersey’s 6th Congressional District. At the office opening, Malinowski said he would fight back Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He said he would fight to preserve Social Security and Medicare. And he said, according to the article, ""Congressman Pallone, I will fight to repeal that tax bill."" Malinowski’s campaign says it can’t account for what others may have reported or tweeted, including what may have been partial quotes or quotes lacking a fuller context. Campaign spokesman Benji Schwartz noted a number of instances in which Malinowski said clearly that he wants to get rid of parts of the tax bill but make sure other parts, including Opportunity Zone provisions, stay or get replaced. In a joint April 13 appearance on New Jersey Public Media with two other Democrats running in the June primary, Malinowski said his experience in government made him the right candidate to ""deal with the tax bill that needs to be repealed and replaced in the interest of the people in our state."" NJ7 Forward, a progressive coalition, quoted Malinowski in its own description of the tax bill: ""I will work to repeal the Republican tax bill and replace it with tax reform that simplifies and lowers rates for everyone, that cuts special interest loopholes rather than deductions that help the middle class."" In another pre-primary piece, NJ Spotlight, which covers political and public policy news and analysis, presented various positions of the Democratic candidates. The story said Malinowski ""wants to repeal the tax bill and replace it with ‘more fiscally responsible tax reform’ legislation that lowers rates, cuts special interest loopholes and ‘doesn’t explode national debt.’"" On July 18, Malinowski used Twitter to link to a Bloomberg Opinion piece criticizing the tax cuts. Malinowski wrote his own opinion in the tweet: ""Repeal and Replace."" Repeal and Replace. https://t.co/NsSGcqxvsI via @bopinion On his campaign website, Malinowski used those words again: repeal and replace. ""I will work to repeal the GOP tax law and replace it with fiscally responsible tax reform,"" he says in a section dedicated to issues. ""New tax legislation must preserve middle class tax deductions like the State and Local Tax deduction (SALT), which prevented us from being double-taxed on our state payments, close corporate and special interest loopholes, bring home money stashed in foreign tax shelters, and avoid ballooning the deficit."" Lance says his opponent wants to repeal the entire Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. It is true that there was a tweet, a news story and a candidate statement in which the word ""repeal"" appeared without the addition of ""replace."" Malinowski’s spokesman said that in the single instance in which Lance linked the word ""repeal"" directly to his opponent, and not to a third party’s characterization, it was when Malinowski was talking solely about the SALT deduction. Malinowski wants to get the full SALT deduction back. ""Replacing"" it would make no sense, the spokesman said. That may be. But Malinowski has used the word ""repeal"" and been described by others including the CWA in New Jersey, which endorsed him, as supporting repeal. He and Lance disagree on other portions of the tax bill, but they both say they want to keep the Opportunity Zone tax incentives. Perhaps eventually there will be legislation that one of them -- the winner in November -- can vote on. Until then, there are words, and Lance was able to point to the word ""repeal"" several times. That doesn't mean he is totally correct on his opponent's intentions, however.  For these reasons, we rate Lance’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2018/sep/21/leonard-lance/malinowski-lance-tax-bill-fight/

Tony Evers supports cutting prison population 50%, but releasing thousands of violent criminals?
","A week before the primary vote, when Republican Gov. Scott Walker didn’t know which opponent he would face in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election, he tweeted this claim: ""A number of Democrats running for governor want to cut the prison population by 50%"" and ""that would require the release of thousands of violent felons.""   Our rating was Half True. There was no evidence to back up the ""require"" part of Walker’s claim, particularly if a 50 percent reduction were done over a period of years, rather than swiftly. A new, similar Walker attack  — zeroing in on Tony Evers  — has a similar problem. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. On Sept. 12, 2018, a month after Evers, the state schools superintendent, emerged from the primary as the Democratic nominee, Walker elevated his attack to a television ad. The governor’s spot begins with a narrator portraying Evers as putting the public at risk, saying he ""failed to remove abusive teachers from our schools."" Then the narrator asserts that Evers ""wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities."" Walker’s use of the word today aims to avoid the problem that the word require caused in his previous fact check. That is, a 50 percent reduction ""today"" — rather than say, over a period of years — would require the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes. There are currently about 23,000 inmates, two-thirds of whom have committed a violent offense, according to the state Department of Corrections. That two-thirds portion includes inmates being held for a violent-crime conviction; and it includes those who served their time behind bars for that original offense, but were returned to prison for violating conditions of probation or extended supervision that was also part of the sentence for the original offense. Violent offenses include crimes such as murder, rape and robbery, as well as crimes such as assault, extortion and hit-and-run with bodily injury. But Evers has not put a time frame on how he would achieve a 50 percent reduction. And it’s important to keep in mind that releasing half the inmates who are in prison isn’t the only way to cut the prison population in half. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. On the day Walker’s TV ad was released, Evers reacted by telling reporters: ""That’s a lie. I never said that. We will not release violent criminals. We’re not going to get in the gutter with Scott Walker."" (Walker has also made a claim similar to the one in his TV ad in a private telephone poll of voters done by his campaign.) To back the first part of Walker’s claim — that Evers supports a 50 percent cut -- Walker’s campaign cites an exchange during a July 12, 2018 debate  between Democrats who were running for governor. A reference was made to the group Milwaukee Inner-City Congregations Allied for Hope. Moderator: The multi-racial interfaith organization MICAH launched a campaign in 2011 to cut the state prison population by half, from 22,000 to 11,000. It now sits at 23,000. Do you support that original goal, and how would you balance reducing the prison population  — Evers: Absolutely, and that's a goal that’s worth accomplishing … We have to stop people incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. The Walker campaign argues that Evers’ response means he is committing to a 50 percent reduction over four years because MICAH’s website refers to a campaign in 2011 to get the 50 percent cut by 2015. But neither the question to Evers, nor his response, mentions four years. And we found no evidence that Evers has committed to any time frame. Evers has said Wisconsin should cut parole revocations and expand drug courts as ways of reducing the number of people being sent to prison. He has also said he would consider releasing some inmates early; treating 17-year-olds as juveniles instead of adults for criminal charges; and overhauling truth-in-sentencing so prisoners could be released for good behavior. 
Kenneth Streit, a clinical professor of law emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Law School, told us it’s possible to achieve a 50 percent cut without releasing inmates convicted of violent crimes — or at least not thousands of them. Streit has studied corrections policy since 1990 and has assisted the Legislature and the Department of Corrections in developing and evaluating adult community corrections programs. He said the population could be reduced by about 5 percent annually over the next decade through steps such as changing sentencing guidelines and tripling funding for treatment-based probation that would reduce the number of people going back to prison for probation revocations.   Whether a 10-year time frame, or longer, would be acceptable to advocates for the 50 percent reduction is unclear; many want a quicker turnaround. But, despite Walker’s claim, it’s also not clear that Evers would seek a 50 percent cut over a period that would force the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes. One more point before we close: Ryan King, research director at the nonprofit Justice Policy Institute, who formerly did studies for the Urban Institute and the Pew Research Center, said research shows that people who are in prison for violence are less likely to be rearrested after release than people sentenced for other offenses. Walker says Evers ""wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities."" Evers has stated that a 50 percent reduction is a goal. But he has not put a time frame on achieving that — a crucial factor in determining whether inmates of convicted of violent crimes would have to be released. 
Experts say a 50 percent reduction over a relatively short period, say a few years, would require the release of inmates convicted of violent crimes. But some say it’s possible to cut the population in half, perhaps over 10 years, without the release of any violent offenders, or at least not thousands of them.

GOP super PAC wrongly says Democrat Bredesen supports single-payer health plan
","In Tennessee’s U.S. Senate race, Democrat Phil Bredesen presents himself as a centrist candidate who just wants to fix problems. The Senate Leadership Fund aimed to change that image with an ad that casts him as a radical leftist when it comes to health care. The Republican super PAC, built by allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is spending $1.2 million on a television ad that opens with the bold headline: ""Bredesen supports single-payer health care."" ""Phil Bredesen is on record supporting single-payer health care,"" a woman’s voice says. ""He even wrote a book pushing socialized medicine."" The ad pops the cover of Bredesen’s 2010 book Fresh Medicine. Bredesen made a small fortune as a health care executive. He was an early critic of Obamacare but now says he does not want to repeal the law. Single-payer health care didn’t seem quite like his style, so we cracked open his book and took a look at the ad’s claims. In 2010, Bredesen had a plan that would give every American a voucher that they could use to buy basic health coverage –– not from a traditional insurance company but from newly created ""systems of care."" The money for the vouchers would come from a payroll tax of about 20 percent. Providers would redeem the voucher money from the government, but the government would not be paying claims as it does under Medicaid and Medicare. Bredesen today says he opposes single-payer health care. The Senate Leadership Fund draws heavily from Bredesen’s 2010 interview on C-SPAN about Fresh Medicine. ""Single-payer, the federal government collecting the money and then turning it over, I mean that’s what I think actually we should do,"" Bredesen said Oct. 20, 2010. ""Single-payer in the sense of Medicare, where government is collecting the money and then is paying all the claims, I think would be a disastrous direction for the country."" In that one answer, Bredesen used the term single-payer two different ways, and had totally opposite takes on each. In another of the super PAC’s examples, Bredesen redefined Medicare for All, a popular shorthand for single-payer care. ""What I was proposing was really a two-piece thing,"" Bredesen told Governing magazine in 2010. ""It's Medicare for All, but give people a voucher and limit the amount of it. I don't think you can solve it by leaving it as an open-ended entitlement."" Bredesen’s proposal went way beyond vouchers, but the idea of vouchers for Medicare, often called premium-support, is something most Democrats have pilloried, and some Republicans, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, have supported. There is a bill in Congress by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to create a Medicare for All program. It would provide soup-to-nuts care for everything that is ""medically necessary."" From family doctors, to prescription drugs, to long-term care, Medicare for All would cover it. Importantly, every American of any age would be eligible and the government would pay doctors, hospitals and every other type of provider. That means no vouchers. As the advocacy group Physicians for a National Health Program put it, ""single-payer national health insurance, also known as ‘Medicare for All,’ is a system in which a single public or quasi-public agency organizes health care financing, but the delivery of care remains largely in private hands."" Bredesen’s proposal would cover every American, and government would play a huge role in defining what is and isn’t covered. But after that, his approach takes a different path. In his 2010 book, Bredesen envisioned a country filled with large multi-faceted provider networks he calls ""systems of care."" ""What I mean specifically by this phrase is a formal organization that receives a determined payment for each of its patients, takes responsibility for the delivery, quality, coordination and payment for health care for for those who belong to it, and which competes with other systems of care in its geographic area for the business of citizens,"" Bredesen wrote. So the government would determine how much a standard basket of care would cost, give everyone a voucher for that amount and let them pick the network they liked best. The network would know that the voucher is all it would get for each person. If people wanted more, they could buy it from their own pocket. Employer-sponsored health insurance would be gone, and in large measure, so would insurance companies. The money for the vouchers would come from payroll taxes, which would be high, but less than the premiums people pay today, Bredesen argued. This table summarizes some of the key similarities and differences between Medicare for All and Bredesen’s plan: Everyone covered Basic package of care Voucher Government pays providers Medicare for All Yes Yes No Yes Bredesen Yes Yes Yes No ""Single-payer implies that there is one entity such as the federal government that collects funds and pays for health care,"" said RAND health economist Christine Eibner. ""The voucher system described –– which involves multiple competing payers –– wouldn’t fit into that category."" Health policy professor Paul Ginsburg at the University of Southern California also said that today’s single-payer label wouldn’t apply. Ginsburg does see some key similarities between Bredesen’s idea and today’s Medicare Advantage program. With Medicare Advantage, a person over 65 picks a private plan and pays premiums, with some additional payments coming from Washington. ""Large delivery systems are partnering with insurers to offer Medicare Advantage plans with networks built around the system,"" Ginsburg said. Eibner told us that while Bredesen’s approach doesn’t fit with the popular understanding of single-payer plans, the term is not precisely defined. Bredesen’s vision for a future health care system built on organizations that don’t yet exist comes from a book he wrote eight years ago. Where he stands today is less clear. At a June 20, 2018, campaign event in Tennessee, he said he was ""not for single-payer, particularly."" His campaign website gives no details of his plan, although it does offer a link to Fresh Medicine. We asked his campaign if he had a policy paper on health care and heard that he does not. The Senate Leadership Fund said Bredesen supports a single-payer plan. Bredesen used those words in a 2010 book interview, but in the same breath, he said a single-payer plan would be disastrous. Health policy researchers find telling differences between Bredesen’s ideas and single-payer plans as they are proposed today. Most important, Bredesen proposed a voucher system and the government would not pay provider claims. By that yardstick, they said his proposal does not fit the single-payer category. Plus, Bredesen said recently that he is not for a single-payer plan. The ad obscures some very important details and misleads voters on Bredesen’s stance.

In an amazing coincidence, Martha Kavanaugh was the judge in a foreclosure case in which Christine Blasey-Ford’s parents were the defendants. Now it all becomes clear,"" the blog wrote. ""Blasey-Ford is going after Brett Kavanaugh, not because of what he did in high school.

According to the case information archived online, Brett Kavanaugh’s mother, Martha Kavanaugh, did preside over a foreclosure case in which Ford’s parents were defendants. However, according to the same documents, Martha Kavanaugh dismissed the case at the plaintiff’s request. The America First Media Group blog post includes screenshots of that same case information, which says the voluntary motion to dismiss the case was ""granted with prejudice,"" meaning the plaintiff cannot sue over the same issue again. In addition to court records, CBS News found the same information when reporters went to the Montgomery County Court to look into the case. They found that the Blaseys settled with their mortgage lender, and the bank requested Martha Kavanaugh dismiss the case. She did. They found no evidence that the Blaseys appeared in her courtroom. The Gateway Pundit has since updated its story to include a tweet from a CBS reporter. The Gateway Pundit article now says, ""The case was settled amicably and the Blaseys kept their house."" In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Ford’s lawyers said she had ""been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats."" They said as a result of those threats, her family relocated out of their home. The letter also said Ford’s email had been hacked and she had been impersonated online.

Donald Trump wrong on FBI limits in Kavanaugh Supreme Court hearings
","As the Senate Judiciary Committee moves to assess the allegations of sexual assault during Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s high school years, President Donald Trump dismissed a role for the FBI. When a reporter asked if he would ask the FBI to investigate the allegations, Trump said that ""it would seem that the FBI really doesn’t do that."" Here’s how the exchange with reporters unfolded as Trump left the White House for North Carolina: Reporter: ""Why don't you have the FBI investigate Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh?"" Trump: ""Well it would seem that the FBI really doesn’t do that."" Reporter: ""They would if you asked them to."" Trump: ""They’ve investigated about six times before, and it seems that they don’t do that."" Reporter: ""Would you consider asking them to?"" Trump: ""Well, I would let the senators take their course. I would let the senators do it. They’re doing a very good job. They’ve given tremendous amounts of time."" Here, we explore Trump’s claim that the FBI doesn’t investigate issues that emerge during the confirmation process for Supreme Court nominees. • The FBI has participated in the confirmation process in the past. • In 1991, during confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, the FBI investigated Oklahoma law professor Anita Hill’s allegations of sexual harassment against Thomas. • The FBI investigated because the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the White House to make it happen. Today’s controversy involves allegations from California researcher Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh attempted to force himself on her sexually when she was 15 and he was 17. Senate Republicans are pressing for Ford and Kavanaugh to testify immediately. Ford and her lawyers say the FBI should first investigate. Republicans reject the idea. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the chair of the Judiciary Committee, wrote in a Sept. 19 letter that ""we have no power to commandeer an Executive Branch agency into conducting our due diligence."" For any confirmation, the FBI conducts a background check. It is routine, and generally, the report it sends to the White House and the Senate requires no follow-up. We reached out to the White House and didn't hear back, but that might be what Trump had in mind when he mentioned six previous cases. However, there are examples of senators asking for more detail from the FBI. Most notably, in early September 1991, Senate Judiciary staff contacted Oklahoma law professor Anita Hill and specifically raised questions about sexual misconduct by nominee Clarence Thomas. Hill told them about sexual harassment when she and Thomas worked at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. According to Hill, in mid September, committee staff suggested an FBI investigation as a way to get the information in front of committee members. ""Sen. Biden's office then arranged for the investigation,"" Hill said Oct. 7, 1991, referring to Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., who chaired the committee. How did Biden arrange that? NPR reporter Nina Totenberg became part of the story when the FBI material on Hill and Thomas was leaked to her. Hill agreed to talk to Totenberg, and the ensuing coverage unleashed turmoil in the hearing process. Totenberg told us how the FBI was drawn in. ""A couple of senators went to Biden -- Leahy (Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy ) was one -- and said, 'You have to do something,' "" Totenberg said. ""So Biden requested from President George Bush — that was the elder Bush — to please have the FBI interview Hill and Thomas."" Totenberg said in less prominent nominations, Senate committee members request FBI follow-ups ""all the time,"" although not usually on such charged topics as sexual misconduct. Stephen Vladeck, law professor at the University of Texas, said Trump’s assertion that the FBI doesn’t look into things of this nature ""is wrong."" ""The FBI is responsible for background checks of nominees, and routinely updates those checks as new, potentially relevant information comes to light,"" Vladeck said. Stephen Wermiel at the Washington College of Law at American University echoed that point. ""The Judiciary Committee could say to the White House, the background check is now incomplete and could they please resume their work,"" Wermiel told us. ""There is no criminal investigation. This is part of the character and fitness questions they explore."" Trump said that in investigating matters like the allegations against Kavanaugh, ""it seems that they (the FBI) don’t do that."" History says otherwise. The FBI was brought in to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct by Thomas during his confirmation process. The Senate Judiciary Committee lacks the power to order the FBI to investigate, but if it wanted, it could ask the administration to put the FBI on the case.

Did Patrick Morrisey beat Obama at the Supreme Court, saving coal jobs?
","In his quest to win a U.S. Senate seat, Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey is touting a legal accomplishment that he said aided the state’s coal industry. A television ad by Morrisey says, among other things, that Morrisey ""beat (President Barack) Obama at the Supreme Court, saving coal jobs."" (An earlier ad made a similar claim as well.) FIRST TV AD: West Virginia deserves a Senator who will be an ally for @realDonaldTrump, who has a record of beating Obama to save coal jobs, and who will always defend our Second Amendment rights. Watch our first TV ad here --> #WVsen #WVpol pic.twitter.com/cpQ1AmFh7l   Is that correct? We took a closer look. This part of the claim refers to the February 2016 decision by five justices of the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a stay that blocked the Clean Power Plan from going into effect. The plan, developed by the Obama administration’s Environmental Protection Agency and initially released in 2014, would have set a standard for power plants’ emissions of carbon dioxide, which most scientists say are causing global warming. Critics of the plan included the coal industry, which would have suffered because coal has relatively high emissions of carbon dioxide. The stay put the proposal on hold, and it was officially scrapped under President Donald Trump. In October 2015, Morrisey was a key player in leading a coalition of 24 states in a lawsuit against the Clean Power Plan. The lawsuit came the same day as the rule was filed in the Federal Register — the first day the rule could be challenged in court. In an unusual move, the Supreme Court issued its stay only a few months later. Officially, the five justices who granted the stay referred to a related case, North Dakota vs. EPA. And because West Virginia was part of a coalition of two dozen other states, Morrisey did not accomplish this singlehandedly. That said, Morrisey was widely noted as a leader of the effort. ""He was very aggressive in bringing the early rounds of the litigation and trying to get a court order to stop EPA from even finalizing the rule,"" Jeff Holmstead, a former EPA air regulator who is representing a coal industry group in the lawsuit, told the Hill newspaper not long after the Supreme Court stayed the EPA program. ""He really has taken very much a leading role in the Clean Power Plan litigation."" The same month, the Associated Press singled out Morrisey for his role in the legal battle, in an article headlined, ""Rising GOP star in West Virginia fight for coal against EPA."" In 2015, the liberal Economic Policy Institute estimated that the Clean Power Plan could eliminate 63,838 coal mining-related jobs (though the same group estimated that the plan would increase the number of jobs overall by roughly 360,000). So, shelving the plan would be expected to save coal jobs. As it turns out, employment in coal mining has rebounded modestly since the plan was stayed. According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, coal mining employment hit a low in July, August and September 2016. Since then, it’s been on a slight upswing.   In the two-year span since its low point in 2016, coal mining employment has risen by about 8.5 percent, or 4,200 jobs in all. That said, coal mining employment remains far below its mid-1980s peak, and even well below its pre-Great Recession level. An ad for Patrick Morrisey said he ""beat Obama at the Supreme Court, saving coal jobs."" Morrisey wasn’t the only legal player involved in the lawsuit that derailed the Clean Power Plan, but he was widely considered a key figure. And employment levels in the coal industry have recovered, though modestly, and have only returned to their levels from early 2016. The statement is accurate but needs additional context, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/sep/20/patrick-morrisey/did-patrick-morrisey-beat-obama-supreme-court-savi/

Business registrations are up in W.Va., but closures high too
","Has there been an increase in new businesses in West Virginia? The West Virginia Republican Party says so.

The data comes from the Business Statistics Database maintained by the West Virginia Secretary of State’s office, and the office confirmed to PolitiFact the accuracy of the numbers in the tweet. Erin Timony, the office’s assistant communications director, said the numbers focus on limited liability companies and corporate business license registrations by county. Since other types of businesses are not included, the data does not encompass all new businesses in the state. Another point to note: The tweet cites business registrations, but not business closings. ""The number of businesses that are ‘born’ and ‘die’ in a given year (would) provide a more accurate portrayal of business conditions overall,"" said Brian Lego, a research assistant professor of economic forecasting at West Virginia University. This data is compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, though data for both births and deaths is available only through the first quarter of 2017. Here’s a chart showing trends on business births and deaths in West Virginia. Quarters that saw more births than deaths are marked in blue, while quarters that saw deaths exceed births are marked in red:   So, looked at from this perspective, 15 out of 17 of the last quarters have seen more business deaths than births in West Virginia.

Cuomo says he is the all-time Democratic primary champ
","In case anyone doubted the decisiveness of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s primary win, he emphasized the point in a post-election news conference. ""I haven’t analyzed all of the results,"" Cuomo told reporters gathered in New York City on Sept. 14, 2018, the day after the primary election. ""But I believe it was a record turnout. I believe it was one of the highest turnouts in history. I think I received more votes in the Democratic primary than any governor in history. And it was all across the state, all age groups, all demographics. So I think it was a very loud and clear and powerful statement."" Cuomo defeated actor and activist Cynthia Nixon, garnering 64 percent of the vote, according to unofficial returns from the state Board of Elections. But did he receive more votes in a Democratic primary than any of his predecessors? To evaluate his claim, we researched Democratic primary results in years where the winner went on to become governor. We searched Board of Elections records, newspaper clippings, and academic journals. Cuomo received more than 960,000 votes in the 2018 primary, according to unofficial results. How did that compare with other Democratic primaries? Until the 1974 primary, it had been decades since a Democratic primary in which the winner went on to the governor’s office. Al Smith, the Democratic primary winner in 1918, received  199,752 votes. A Democratic primary in 1914 saw Martin Glynn, who had been elevated to the governorship in 1913 and ultimately lost the general election that year, received fewer than 200,000 votes, according to an article from the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. Glynn’s primary was the first for Democratic candidates for governor, as New York enacted direct primaries in December 1913. 
We were also curious about Cuomo’s claim that his win was ""all across the state."" So we turned to a county breakdown of unofficial results from the Board of Elections. Cuomo beat Nixon in 49 counties, and Nixon won in 13 counties. Nixon was successful in eleven counties surrounding and including Albany; Tompkins County, which includes Ithaca; and Lewis County, northeast of Syracuse. We chose not to include this part of his statement in our ruling because his phrasing could be interpreted different ways by readers. He did outpoll Nixon in counties in most regions across the state. Without exit polling data, we could not evaluate Cuomo’s claim that he won all age groups and demographics. Cuomo claimed he won more votes in a Democratic primary than any other governor in the state’s history. The first Democratic primary for governor was in 1914, and an evaluation of results since then shows he is right.   We rate his claim True.  ",/factchecks/2018/sep/20/andrew-cuomo/cuomo-says-he-got-more-votes-democratic-primary/
"['Health Care', 'Missouri', 'Josh Hawley']","
Hawley's claim of lost health care plans has it upside down
","Josh Hawley, Missouri's attorney general and Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, is taking a strong stance on health care and the effects of the Affordable Care Act as he campaigns across Missouri. The act, signed into law in early 2010 by President Barack Obama, has a goal of providing accessible and affordable health insurance to more people. It also sought to expand Medicaid and provide support for medical research techniques aimed at decreasing health care costs. In an Aug. 20 op-ed for the Springfield News-Leader, Hawley again focused on the Affordable Care Act. ""McCaskill told us that if we liked our healthcare plans, we could keep them. She said the cost of health insurance would go down. She said prescription drug prices would fall. She lied. Since then, millions of Americans have lost their health care plans.""  Because of the contradiction between Hawley’s assertion and the promises of the ACA to insure more Americans, we decided to take a closer look. When we asked his campaign team about the claim, we were linked to a Washington Post blog by Sarah Kliff from 2013. This blog, along with several other supporting documents sent to us, focuses on cancellation notices sent out by insurance providers to those with plans that were grandfathered in when the Affordable Care Act took effect. ""Grandfathered plans"" are plans that didn’t meet ACA standards but were still allowed to be sold as coverage for a period of time after the ACA was enacted. The notices made people aware that their grandfathered plans were being phased out of the insurance marketplace, as explained by Kliff in her post. They also provided other coverage options and at least 90 days notice prior to the plan being discontinued, per government requirements for the individual health insurance market. On the surface, these notices can seem alarming, so we reached out to experts to see if they actually meant that people who received them lost health care coverage. Benjamin Sommers, associate professor of health policy and economics at Harvard University, said it is entirely possible that some people who received cancellation notices lost health care coverage, but only if they didn’t seek new coverage. Most individuals would have been able to obtain new coverage after receiving a cancellation notice. ""Many of those individuals were likely eligible for subsidized coverage under the ACA and may have been able to switch onto those plans, in some cases at lower cost,"" said Sommers. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report shows that in the years following the enactment of the health care act, the percentage of uninsured Americans ages 18-64 has steadily dropped from 22.3 percent in 2010 to almost 12 percent this year. The biggest drop during the time when the main provisions of the ACA took effect was between 2013 and 2015. We spoke to expert Loren Adler, associate director for the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy, about the number of Americans the policy incorporated. He noted that roughly 20 million more people gained health care coverage during this time period. Cicily Hampton, senior director of health science and policy at the Society for Public Health Education, said the uninsured rate is likely to rise after Congress dropped the individual mandate in its December 2017 tax bill. The individual mandate penalizes people who did not buy any health insurance although they could afford to by requiring them to pay a fee, subsequently causing more people to purchase insurance plans. By removing this, some Americans may not purchase health insurance because they will no longer be fined for doing so. U.S. Senate candidate Josh Hawley wrote in an op-ed for the Springfield News-Leader that ""millions of Americans have lost their healthcare plans."" He has focused in on this issue as a part of his campaign. But our experts and even the source provided by Hawley’s team contradicted this, clarifying that just because you received a cancellation notice doesn’t mean that you no longer have health insurance. Hawley’s claim is misleading because it asserts that coverage was automatically lost. Other options and a sizable time period were given to those experiencing cancellations. Coverage was only lost if a new plan was not sought out by the individual before his or her  previous plan was phased out. For those reasons, we rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/sep/20/josh-hawley/hawleys-claim-lost-health-care-plans-has-it-upside/
"['Children', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Tony Evers']","
Evers' special education funding claim passes the test
","State schools superintendent Tony Evers, the Democratic challenger facing Gov. Scott Walker, has pledged to seek $606.1 million increase in funding for special education programs, which would bring funding for such services to $900 million by 2021. ""School districts have a legal obligation to kids with disabilities, and they are required to provide those services,"" Evers said when he made the announcement. ""That, in turn, puts pressure on the rest of the school budget. It’s time to change that momentum."" States use different methods to allocate special education funds. Wisconsin is one of five that reimburse schools for the costs incurred for educating special-needs students. It is considered ""categorical aid"" -- that is, based on a category outside of the regular funding formula. According to a report from the state Department of Public Instruction: ""This categorical aid is the state’s primary direct fund source to recognize the additional costs of educating pupils with disabilities. This critical aid program has widespread statewide impact providing funding for all pupils with disabilities, approximately 14 percent of Wisconsin pupils, providing equal benefit across all school districts."" Evers’ request would more than double the state reimbursement rate for school districts’ special education costs, from 27 percent to 60 percent by 2019. ""We’re going to add $600 million to special education categorical aid; it hasn’t been raised in over a decade,"" Evers said at a primary election forum broadcast Aug. 16, 2018, by WRRD Resistance Radio ""Devil’s Advocates."" Is Evers right? The evidence When asked about special education funding, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Instruction directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, a nonpartisan entity considered the gold standard on state budget matters. According to the fiscal bureau, in the 2006-2007 budget, the number was just over $350 million. In every year since then, the total has been just under $369 million -- $368,939,100, to be exact. Abdur Chowdhury, Marquette University Department of Economics Professor Emeritus, said inflation in the U.S. from 2007-’18 averaged between 1 percent and 2 percent. Thus, he said, ""in later years, you need to provide more nominal aid in order to be equal to real aid in the early years."" So, to keep up with inflation, the $368,939,100 in fiscal year 2007 aid would have to have amounted to this much in subsequent years: 2008-’09 -- $381,741,700 2009-’10 -- $388,003,320 2010-’11-- $400,250,755 2011-’12 -- $408,533,744 2012-’13 -- $414,517,781 2013-’14 -- $421,242,038 2014-’15 -- $421,742,043 2015-’16 -- $427,062,373 2016-’17 -- $436,160,315 At the same time, the report notes that while costs have increased, Wisconsin has experienced a decrease in special education enrollment since fiscal year 2007: 2007-2008 -- 124,520 2008-2009 -- 123,734 2009-2010 -- 123,412 2010-2011 -- 122,763 2011-2012 -- 121,881 2012-2013 -- 121,378 2013-2014 -- 120,698 2014-2015 -- 118,601 2015-2016 -- 118,923 2016 -2017 -- 118,209 That represents an enrollment drop of 5.07 percent from 2007-’08 to 2016-’17. The enrollment counts for 2018-’19 are not final, but they are expected to again decrease. So, all this raises a question about what has happened with the per-student average -- and whether that has kept up with inflation. According to the Department of Public Instruction, special education costs per pupil in 2008-’09 was $10,388, with the state on average paying $2,981, or nearly 29 percent per pupil. In 2018, the estimated cost per pupil is at $12,084, with the state on average paying $3,140, or nearly 26 percent per pupil. So, had the per-pupil amount being paid by the state kept pace with inflation, it would be an estimated $3,489.18 in 2018, not the projected $3,140. A DPI spokesman pointed out that the per pupil figures are just special education costs, and ""those ride on top of regular education costs."" The Walker team When asked about Evers’ claim, Walker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to Walker education initiatives that feature targeted aid in the form of grants and other avenues for special education students: Altenburg did not say whether he was arguing these programs more than make up for the lack of increase in the main aid program. In any case, Evers was talking about the main categorical state aid for education, and that is what we are focusing on here. Our rating Evers said ""special education categorical aid"" from the state ""hasn’t been raised in over a decade."" The Walker administration has launched several initiatives that feature targeted aid in the form of grants for special education students, but the special education categorical aid continues to be set at nearly $369 million. Data shows a per-pupil increase in raw dollars paid by the state, from $2,981, or 28.6 percent, per pupil in 2008 to an estimated $3,140, or 25.98 percent, paid per pupil in 2018. But that increase is more than eaten away by inflation. And the state is paying a lower share of the cost per pupil. We rate Evers’ statement Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2018/sep/20/tony-evers/evers-special-education-funding-claim-passes-test/
"['Housing', 'Poverty', ""The 2018 California Governor's Race"", 'California', 'Gavin Newsom']","
TRUE: Nearly half of California’s children are ‘at or near poverty’ when considering cost-of-living
","Democratic candidate for governor Gavin Newsom recently described California as both ""the richest and poorest state."" The economy is booming for many, he said, while millions of others are mired in poverty. That includes nearly half of the state’s children, when considering the state’s high ""cost-of-living,"" he claimed. ""Close to half of the children (are) at or near poverty,"" Newsom said while campaigning in Los Angeles County on Sept. 10, 2018. ""How can that be in this place, this extraordinary place, in the world’s 5th largest economy? We must do more and we must do better."" Did Newsom get his facts right on this sad statistic? We set out on a fact check. Our research Newsom’s campaign spokesman said the claim is supported by the July 2018 report ""Child Poverty in California.""  That study produced an updated look at what researchers call the California Poverty Measure, which is a joint research effort by the Public Policy Institute of California and the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality to closely examine poverty in the state.  It found that 45.8 percent of children in California were ""at or near poverty"" in 2016, the most recent year examined. That matches with Newsom’s statement of ""close to half."" But we wanted to know how researchers came up with that number. Caroline Danielson, a PPIC policy director and co-author of the study, said the California Poverty Measure takes into account California’s high cost-of-living, as well as factors that offset those costs, such as the state’s social safety net programs. The report found the share of children in poverty was 21 percent. It found an additional nearly 25 percent lived ""near poverty,"" meaning their family incomes was one-and-a-half times the poverty line, Danielson said. In the report, the income threshold for poverty varies by region. In a high-cost county, including many places along the coast, the average threshold for a family of four is $30,000 per year, Danielson explained. A family that makes less than that would be considered in poverty. In that same county, near poverty includes families whose incomes range from $30,000 to $45,000, or one-and-a-half times the poverty line. Other counties had lower income thresholds. To reach 45.8 percent figure, the study combined children who live at or near poverty in all regions of the state. Danielson said the state’s child poverty rate has declined from 25 percent in 2011, the first year PPIC produced the California Poverty Measure, to 21 percent in 2016. Census figures also support claim The finding that nearly half of California’s children live at or near poverty is also supported by data in the U.S. Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure. An updated version of that report, which also takes into account cost-of-living, was released this month. For 2016, it found 22.5 percent of California’s children live in poverty while a total of 45 percent live at or near poverty, according to a review of that report’s 2016 public-use dataset conducted by Danielson at our request. The Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure has gained wide acceptance among researchers over the agency’s Official Poverty Measure, which does not take state-by-state variations in cost into account. Two researchers, however, raised questions in a recent op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle about relying too much on that measure. David Brady, professor of public policy and director of the Blum Initiative on Global and Regional Poverty at UC Riverside and Zachary Parolin, a researcher at the University of Antwerp’s Herman Deleeck Centre for Social Policy, asked ""whether California’s poverty rate should depend so exclusively and overwhelmingly on housing costs."" They proposed using questions about median income, alongside the supplemental poverty measure, to arrive at poverty rates. This isn’t the first claim we’ve fact-checked on California’s dismal poverty rate. In January 2017, we rated True a claim by Republican Assemblyman Chad Mayes that California had the nation’s highest overall poverty rate, when including children and adults and factoring in cost-of-living. Mayes, at the time, was citing the state’s 20.6 percent overall poverty rate for the period 2013 to 2015. That rate has dropped slightly but remains the highest in the nation at 19 percent, according to the Supplemental Poverty Measure for 2017. Newsom’s plan for child poverty Newsom has described California’s child poverty as ""a moral outrage."" His campaign website includes several proposals for reducing it. They include, among other plans, creating college savings accounts for every incoming kindergartener; expanding the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit for very low-income earners; and increasing CalWORKS grants, a financial assistance program for families in need. Our ruling Democratic candidate for governor Gavin Newsom recently claimed ""close to half of the children"" in California are ""at or near poverty,"" when you consider the state’s cost-of-living. A July 2018 report by the Public Policy Institute of California backs up Newsom’s statement. It accounts for cost-of-living in each region of the state and found 45.8 percent of the state’s children live at or near poverty. Another report, the U.S. Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure, also confirms the claim. Newsom’s statement is supported by credible reports and includes necessary context.
