Third-party candidates hamper both Republicans, Democrats
","The sudden and unusual emergence of rapper Kanye West as a potential presidential candidate has sparked questions on what kind of impact the mercurial entertainer could have at the ballot box. The questions — and conspiracy theories — only gained traction when we learned the attorney who submitted West’s signatures for Wisconsin (minutes after the technical deadline) was a former GOP lawyer who is representing Trump’s campaign in a pending lawsuit. One widely-read post on Instagram claimed West joining the race would help Trump — citing past elections as supposed proof. ""Third party votes only siphon from dems for a candidate with no chance of winning,"" said the Aug. 6, 2020 post. The post went on to show a breakdown of total votes cast in Wisconsin from the 2016 election, noting Green Party candidate Jill Stein won more votes here than Republican Donald Trump’s margin of victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. But a review of past elections shows this claim is nonsense. The post was flagged as part of Facebook and Instagram’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership.) Here’s what we found. For starters, the evidence listed by the post isn’t evidence at all. It simply reports the vote totals for Trump, Clinton, Stein and Libertarian Gary Johnson. Clinton lost Wisconsin by 22,748 votes, while Stein accumulated 31,072, according to the Wisconsin Election Commission. But this would only be evidence if every Stein voter had voted for Clinton instead, a claim the post doesn’t make and that experts say is not true. And this line of thinking ignores that Johnson pulled a far larger vote share — 106,674 — and Libertarians have historically drawn more voters from the Republican side. ""This idea that categorically minority parties draw from Democratic voters is just absurd,"" said Christopher Devine, assistant professor of political science at the University of Dayton, whose study on the 2016 third-party candidates is currently going through peer review. Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, agreed. ""Every minor party or independent candidate who has run in modern history has taken some votes from (both parties),"" said Burden, who has authored numerous studies on the impact of third-party candidates. ""It’s also incorrect to say the votes come even disproportionately from a Democratic candidate."" To be sure, some third-party candidates have swung races to Democrats, most notably the 2000 election where Ralph Nader’s presence pulled votes that could have swung Florida — and ultimately the country — in favor of Al Gore instead of George W. Bush. But the impact in other recent elections has varied, according to experts and an array of studies. The impact depended on the specific background of the third-party candidate. In the 2016 election, voters who backed Johnson or Stein would have leaned toward Trump if forced to choose in a two-way race, according to a survey by international research group YouGov. Among likely voters, 34% preferred Trump, 25% preferred Clinton and 42% said they had no preference. The Washington Post cited exit polls in reporting Johnson likely moved the final margin about 0.4% in Trump’s favor. And a study from Devine going through peer review found Johnson voters would have favored Trump by a 2-to-1 margin in a two-person race. Nader in 2000 is the most prominent example of third-party impact given the historically tiny margin deciding that election. Florida’s outcome determined the presidency, and Bush topped Gore there by a mere 537 votes. Nader received 97,488 votes in Florida. And national exit polling showed Nader voters would have chosen Gore (47%) over Bush (21%) in a two-man race. A book by Burden estimated a similar breakdown. The highest-polling third-party candidate in recent history was Ross Perot, who ran in 1992 and 1996. He drew support from both parties, but a study by Burden found 36% of Perot voters would have backed George H.W. Bush with Perot out of the 1992 race, while 44% would have supported Bill Clinton. About 20% would not have voted. Devine noted that Libertarians, the most prominent and successful third-party in recent decades, have nominated a slate of former Republican politicians, and ""clearly it has tended to draw more from Republicans over the years."" The trickier question is what impact West could have on the 2020 race if he does make it on the ballot in Wisconsin or anywhere else. West has previously supported Trump — including donning a ""Make America Great Again"" hat — but he’s such an unusual candidate experts say it’s too early to say much for sure. A July 2020 poll found Biden leading Trump 48% to 40% if West wasn’t mentioned. But if West was included as a potential candidate in the poll question, Biden remained at 48% while Trump dropped a point to 39%. ""He has a kind of unorthodox and muddled set of things he would do in office, so it’s not a clear ideological thing he has to offer,"" Burden said. ""He’s more progressive in some issues, but he’s also pro-life apparently and in favor of private schools to some degree, things Democrats wouldn’t normally go for. I think he would appeal to a real hodgepodge of voters."" Addressing the potential addition of West in the 2020 race, an Instagram post claimed ""Third party votes only siphon from dems for a candidate with no chance of winning."" There have been prominent examples of Democrats losing votes, most notably Nader in 2000. But experts are unanimous in noting this is not remotely true as a hard-and-fast-rule. The 2016 election even disproves this claim, with far more third-party voters favoring Trump over Clinton. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DC2680>],/factchecks/2020/aug/10/instagram-posts/third-party-candidates-hamper-both-republicans-dem/

This Disney movie is not nodding to Pizzagate
","In the original version of the 2002 Disney movie ""Lilo & Stitch,"" there’s a scene in which Lilo hides from her older sister in the dryer during a fight. But earlier this year, TikTok users drew attention to a change in the animated movie, BuzzFeed reported. Lilo is hiding behind a pizza box, not a dryer. On Facebook, posts such as this one are casting this film edit in a nefarious light, using hashtags like #savethechildren and #Pizzagate, a baseless conspiracy theory that emerged in 2016 and claims that children were being abused and tortured at a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C.

HEROES Act includes more election funding, does not 'demand' mail-in voting
","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to ""blackmail"" Congress, according to a post on Facebook with heavy use of all-caps: ""PELOSI BLACKMAILS CONGRESS! She DEMANDS MAIL IN VOTING or NO 2nd STIMULUS for you and your family."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This claim is inaccurate for a lot of reasons, but first some background. Under a stimulus package signed into law in March, millions of out-of-work Americans were receiving an additional $600 per week to help them better manage the financial blow dealt by the coronavirus pandemic. Those checks expired at the end of July, and Washington lawmakers are embroiled in negotiations over what should be included in a new stimulus package. The Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, also known as the HEROES Act, passed the Democrat-led House of Representatives more than two months ago. The Health, Economic Assistance, Liability Protection, and Schools Act, also called the HEALS Act, was introduced by Senate Republicans at the end of July but hasn’t passed the Senate yet.  There is a $2 trillion price difference between the two bills, but both offer the extension of stimulus checks from the CARES Act, with the HEROES Act upping the payment amount for dependents and extending the checks to immigrants with taxpayer identification numbers. Now, back to the claim that Pelosi  ""demands"" mail-in voting and is ""blackmailing"" Congress.  Pelosi said in April that the House’s second stimulus package would ""be supporting vote by mail in a very important way."" The stimulus proposal passed by the House doesn’t include any legislation specific to mail-in voting, but it does fund elections generally. The bill includes up to $3.6 billion in funding for the ""planning, preparation, and resilience of elections,"" that would be distributed to states. So far, state governors are the ones deciding how to conduct voting and if they will only have mail-in voting in November. Congress already allocated $400 million in election funding for states in the CARES Act, and there is bipartisan support for more funding for states considering mail-in or early voting. The Republican-backed Senate bill does not include any extra funding for election safety during COVID-19. Federal law describes blackmail as a criminal offense punishable by fine, up to a year in prison or both. It amounts to someone demanding money or something of value from another ""under threat of informing or consideration for not informing against a violation of any law of the United States."" Pelosi has shown support for mail-in voting. But there is no evidence or credible suggestion she has blackmailed anyone. Frances Hill, law professor at the University of Miami, describes Pelosi’s negotiations with Republicans as ""playing hardball,"" which is ""routinely played by House Speakers"" and not considered ""blackmail."" ""Voting is the foundation of our democracy and Congress has a duty to ensure that appropriate funding is available,"" she said. Our ruling A Facebook post claimed that Pelosi is ""blackmailing"" Congress by not allowing a second stimulus bill to pass unless everyone votes by mail. Not only are state governors the only ones deciding how each state will vote, but the HEROES Act Pelosi is negotiating includes state funding for safe voting without any reference to mail-in voting.

No, the U.S. hasn’t achieved herd immunity from COVID-19
","Sharing a graph of COVID-19 testing trends in the United States, a recent Facebook post claims that ""HERD IMMUNITY HAS BEEN REACHED."" ""In fact,"" the post says, ""it was probably reached in May."" The post points to two ""bumps"" in the data. The first bump, it says, reflects when at-risk patients were tested for COVID-19 in hospitals. The second bump reflects when testing became more available to more people, according to the post.  ""We’re looking at the downward trend of that second bump,"" the post says. ""Ask any biostatistician what it means when you test hundreds of thousands of people a day for an infectious disease and return a consistently lowering positivity rate. I’ll give you a clue: it means heard immunity has been reached and the virus is dying out."" (The misspelling of ""herd"" is in the original post.) This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We’ll cut to the chase before drilling down into the details: No, we have not reached herd immunity, a subject we’ve written about before.  Scientists generally say herd immunity could play a role in curbing the spread of the coronavirus before a vaccine becomes available. The idea is that once a disease infects enough people in a community, if the infection confers immunity, then there are fewer people left who can still transmit the disease, so the spread slows. For the coronavirus, scientists estimate herd immunity will probably be reached when 60% to 70% of the population has been infected.  The graph featured in the Facebook post shows daily changes in COVID-19 tests performed in the United States and test positivity rates over the months. It’s available on Johns Hopkins University’s website.  But Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, said it ""cannot in any way be used to assess whether or not we’ve achieved herd immunity."" The Facebook post, she said, is a ""completely inappropriate interpretation of what it’s showing.""  Rather, she said, test positivity is a measure specialists use to gauge whether a community is conducting enough testing. Because the rate of people testing positive for COVID-19 can change depending on the number of tests administered, it doesn’t necessarily reflect how many people are becoming infected. Low positivity rates, for example, could result from simply testing a large number of uninfected people, she said. Plus, asymptomatic people who are infected and possibly spreading the disease may never get tested. Scientists use serological surveys of a representative sample of the population to estimate what fraction of a community has likely been infected with COVID-19, Nuzzo said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has done this, and according to its most recent findings, ""no one is near herd immunity, even in the hardest-hit places in the United States.""   ""Other countries, including places like Sweden that have not implemented the same level of shutdowns like the United States — their surveys say the same thing: that the vast majority of us remain susceptible to this virus,"" she said.  We contacted several other specialists for help parsing the claims in the Facebook post. We even asked a biostatistician, as the post suggested. ""This post is not accurate,"" said Natalie Dean, a biostatistics professor at the University of Florida.  Because test positivity is low in some areas, like New York, and high in others, like Florida, it’s ""not particularly meaningful to look at the entire United States as one unit,"" she said. ""While numbers in some of the hotspot states appear to be stabilizing, it is hard to know for sure, because testing capacity is strained and there are significant backlogs."" That makes daily positivity numbers less reliable. Still, she said, decreasing 911 calls for respiratory distress in some cities and indicate that the spread of COVID-19 is slowing down. That’s likely due to policy and behavioral changes in different communities. But broadly in the United States, COVID-19 is ""spreading like wildfire,"" said Andrew Noymer, a population health and disease prevention professor at the University of California-Irvine.  When testing increases, the percentage of positive tests can decrease simply because more people are being tested, he said. ""So percent positive testing going down doesn’t mean anything."" The Facebook post, he said, ""is just a bunch of mumbo jumbo.""   Jaquelin Dudley, a professor of molecular biosciences at the University of Texas at Austin, said it’s possible there are areas where herd immunity has been established, ""but there are still many unknowns, including lack of testing for asymptomatic individuals or missing the right point during infection for testing."" At this point, though, we can’t accurately predict a timeline for when there will be herd immunity throughout the United States, she said.  We rate this Facebook post False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C41AD80>],/factchecks/2020/aug/07/facebook-posts/no-us-hasnt-achieved-herd-immunity-covid-19/

No proof that Black Lives Matter killed 36 people, injured 1,000 police officers
","Some Facebook commenters focused on professional sports leagues’ support of Black Lives Matter when they read this Facebook post: ""BLM injures 1000 police officers kills 36 people and does $8 billion in damage and gets celebrated by pro sports?"" We focused on the rest, and found that the biggest problem with the post, leaving aside the numbers claimed, is the lack of proof that Black Lives Matter caused the violence that is claimed.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The latest flareup of protests against police brutality began May 26 in Minneapolis, where the previous day, George Floyd, a Black man, died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck. As we reported two weeks after the protests began, a review of demonstrations in five major cities found that all of the protests started with violence, but then became largely peaceful. As for the numbers claimed in the post, the U.S. Justice Department told us it does not have figures on officer injuries or property damage resulting from civil disturbances, and the FBI said it had no comment. There are scattered news reports that don’t entirely back up each part of the claim, and we found no official figures. Officers injured: The New York Post reported on June 8, citing the U.S. Justice Department, that more than 700 law enforcement officers were injured on the job during nationwide protests over Floyd’s death.  People killed: In early June, news accounts reported the number of people killed during the Floyd protests at roughly a dozen, or as many as 19. The victims include a 77-year-old man who was a retired St. Louis police captain and a 22-year-old woman from Davenport, Iowa. Damage caused: In late June, Fox News reported that according to insurance experts and city officials, the Floyd protests could eclipse the 1992 Los Angeles riots to become the most expensive civil disturbance in U.S. history. The 1992 riots, which followed the acquittal of four police officers in the beating of Rodney King, cost $1.4 billion in 2020 dollars, according to the report, which did not give a specific damage estimate for the Floyd protests. A spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute told Scripps National News that ""most likely"" the Floyd protest ""would lead to higher losses,"" but did not provide an estimate either. Black Lives Matter didn’t respond to our requests for comment.  There is a Black Lives Matter national organization, which says it has more than a dozen U.S. chapters, along with countless numbers of individuals who support the organization.  As the New York Times reported July 3, four recent polls ""suggest that about 15 million to 26 million people in the United States have participated in demonstrations over the death of George Floyd and others in recent weeks. These figures would make the recent protests the largest movement in the country’s history, according to interviews with scholars and crowd-counting experts."" There are also people who have participated in demonstrations, which have occurred in hundreds of cities, who may have no allegiance to Black Lives Matter, or may even oppose it, and have rioted or committed other acts of violence — making it even more difficult to determine how a violent incident occurred. What’s more, news coverage of the protests have also included numerous reports that identify law enforcement officers as causing injury to civilians. In short, there isn’t evidence to back the numbers in the claim or to blame Black Lives Matter for each part of the claim. Our rating is False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C41AB00>],/factchecks/2020/aug/07/facebook-posts/no-proof-black-lives-matter-killed-36-people-injur/

Fake video shows missile attack in Beirut explosion
","A video of Beirut’s harbor moments before the huge blast that leveled the area purports to show a missile strike. At about the four-second mark, a long, white object flashes in from the upper left corner. A massive explosion follows. The video has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter. (Many instances of the video have been removed from both platforms.) Don’t be fooled. Digital forensics professor Hany Farid at the University of California-Berkeley said ""it is clearly and obviously a fake."" ""If you watch the video frame by frame, you will notice a few things that clearly illustrate it to be a crude fake,"" Farid said. The missile disappears before the explosion, Farid said, and there is no motion blur on the missile, which, he said, you would see given the speed a missile travels. And, Farid continued, the missile looks identical in each frame. ""This is a tell-tale sign of a crude copy-paste manipulation in which the missile was pasted into each successive frame,"" Farid said. In freeze-frame, the missile also is bent in the middle.

There is at least one other manipulated video that claims to show a missile strike causing the blast. The latest reports out of Beirut say the cause was a fire that ignited 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer with great explosive potential, that had been stored in a warehouse since 2014.

","An explosion at a warehouse at the port of Beirut on Aug. 4 killed more than 100 people and injured thousands. Lebanese authorities have said the blast was caused by ammonium nitrate, a chemical commonly used in fertilizer, that was being stored at the warehouse. But the explosion has inspired a slew of conspiracy theories about its cause on social media, several of which we’ve debunked. One such Facebook post seems incredible, showing six photos of fire and smoke plumes that are described as happening in six different locations around the world: Beirut; Hyesan, North Korea; Wuhan, China; United Arab Emirates; Najaf, Iraq; and St. Paul, Minn.

The story appears in Japanese, but UPI, which cites Daily DK among other South Korean news sources, reported that a gas explosion occurred on Aug. 3 in Hyesan, a North Korean city along the China border.  The photo the post says is from Wuhan, China, is actually from the nearby city of Xiantao, where there was an explosion at a chemical factory on Aug. 3. The Xiantao Party Committee Propaganda Department said on social media that the blast happened in a workshop used to store butanone oxime, according to the Daily Mail.  The photo the post says is from the United Arab Emirates shows the scene of a large fire that broke out in the city of Ajman there on Aug. 5. National UAE reported that the fire is believed to have started in a market that had been shuttered for several months due to the coronavirus. The cause is still unknown.  The photo the post says is from Najaf, Iraq, appears to actually show a still of a video of the Ajman fire in the UAE. A video posted on the website of the Mehr News Agency appears to show a different fire the Iranian news service describes as ""a massive fire in more than 20 warehouses of wholesale markets in Najaf, Iraq, on Aug. 5.

Pizzagate conspiracy theorists spread false claims about Beirut explosion, human trafficking

A post published Aug. 4 on Facebook includes a screenshot of footage from Al Jazeera. A rectangular object is circled in the background. ""Evergreen Shipping Container,"" reads a caption on the image. ""Human Trafficking by HRC."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Similar posts have been shared thousands of times in Facebook groups dedicated to the Pizzagate and QAnon conspiracy theories, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool owned by Facebook. Both conspiracy theories make baseless claims about public figures’ connections to child sex trafficking rings. (Screenshot from Facebook) The conspiracy theory promoted on Facebook after the Beirut explosion goes like this:  Hillary Clinton is allegedly part of a cabal that’s involved in a global child sex trafficking operation. Clinton’s Secret Service code name was ""evergreen."" Evergreen is also the name of a Taiwanese shipping company that’s allegedly linked to sex trafficking. Photos from the scene of the Beirut explosion appear to show shipping containers. Therefore, someone bombed Beirut to cover up Clinton’s tracks. That’s the story. But it’s baseless.  Let’s start with the facts. A large explosion occurred Aug. 4 at the port of Beirut. Lebanese officials have attributed the tragedy to the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate, a chemical commonly used in fertilizer, with the aid of fireworks. However, the developing investigation hasn’t ruled out a ""rocket or bomb"" as a possible cause of the fire. In 2019, the port of Beirut moved more than 1.2 million twenty-foot equivalent units of cargo. Satellite imagery from before and after the explosion shows dozens of shipping containers along the waterfront. Put bluntly: Ports have shipping containers. Evergreen Marine Corp., a company based in Taipei, works with the Phoenician Maritime Agency to ship cargo to Beirut. We found no evidence that it’s involved in a human trafficking operation. Clinton’s Secret Service codename was ""evergreen,"" which she herself has said. It’s unclear if the image in the Facebook post depicts an Evergreen shipping container. And even if it did, none of those discrete facts would add up to what the post is claiming.  There is no evidence that Clinton is involved in a sex trafficking ring. The false conspiracy theory has been circulating since 2016. RELATED: QAnon conspiracy theorists seek to link Beirut explosion to Rothschilds The Pizzagate conspiracy theory emerged after WikiLeaks released emails from John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign manager. Some fringe internet users noticed that Podesta had communicated with the owner of Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in Washington, D.C., to discuss a potential fundraiser, and they claimed that Podesta’s use of the word ""pizza"" was a code word for pedophilia. The successor of Pizzagate is QAnon, a right-wing conspiracy theory that in part alleges President Donald Trump and former special counsel Robert Mueller are working together to arrest child molesting elites. Groups dedicated to the conspiracy theory often float unproven or bogus claims in the wake of major news events. While investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the Beirut explosion, there is no indication that it had anything to do with Clinton or a sex trafficking ring.

GOP lawmaker only tells part of story in claim that Wisconsin spent 3.8% of federal coronavirus aid
","Wisconsin’s congressional delegation is embroiled in a debate over whether to send more aid to state and local governments squeezed by the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in May passed the so-called HEROES Act, which would allocate nearly $1 trillion to state, local and tribal governments, among other provisions. However, Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump balked at that plan. The Senate has not passed its own version of a new COVID-relief bill, but White House officials are negotiating with Democrats in hopes of reaching an agreement on various issues. In the midst of the debate, one Wisconsin Republican suggested Wisconsin may not need another round of federal funding. ""According to the Treasury Department, 3.8% of Wisconsin’s coronavirus funding has been spent,"" U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil tweeted on July 30, 2020. ""The rest is unaccounted for. I’ve asked Gov. (Tony) Evers to explain."" Steil, who represents the state’s 1st Congressional District, hinged his argument on data from the U.S. Department of Treasury that points to the same figure.  But the Treasury’s report is only part of the story. Wisconsin received about $2.26 billion through the CARES Act to help the state manage costs stemming from the pandemic. Around $260 million of that went to Dane County, Milwaukee County and the city of Milwaukee, which were eligible for direct payments because their populations are over 500,000. That left the state with roughly $2 billion. Evers can direct the spending. He does not need approval from the Legislature. When asked for evidence to support Steil’s claim, a spokeswoman pointed to the report from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which shows Wisconsin has spent or transferred around $75.6 million, or 3.8%, of its $2 billion in CARES Act funds. Recipients were required to report their spending to the department’s Office of Inspector General from March 1 to June 30. On July 29, Steil wrote a letter to Evers seeking ""greater clarity on Wisconsin’s use of existing federal resources."" In the letter — but not the tweet — he notes that some funds have been spent while others were only obligated. The letter cited a June 18 memo from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which outlined $1.72 billion in COVID-19 initiatives that would be covered through the CARES Act. That leaves $280 million in federal dollars remaining. Among the plans: $200 million in aid for local and tribal governments, $260 million for a COVID-19 testing program and $110 million to provide assistance to health care providers. Another $445 million was set aside for ""hospital and community preparedness"" in the event cases surge before the end of the year. The state Department of Administration detailed those funding commitments in a July 17 letter to the U.S. Treasury Department. According to the letter, provided by Evers’ office, the documented amount does not include at least $67.2 million in costs incurred before June 30 that will be covered by federal funding. Those funds will also cover $108.3 million already obligated for the state’s coronavirus response, the letter states. ""Because of the difference in timing between purchase orders, invoices, and payments, however, as well as the reimbursement model used for several of these programs, today’s interim report will capture only a portion (of) the reach of Wisconsin’s CRF funded commitments at the present moment,"" wrote Joanna Beilman-Dulin of the DOA.  Translation: The spending reported by the U.S. Department of Treasury tracks just that — spending. It doesn’t include previous expenses or allocated relief funds, such as orders that have yet to be invoiced and grant programs with applications under review. What’s more, Evers announced on July 27 — before Steil contacted the governor — that $41.6 million in federal funds had been distributed to farmers. That amount wasn’t included in the Treasury data because it was still under review when the state submitted its report. That means the number Steil cited doesn’t show the complete picture.  As Congress debates what the next federal relief package should look like, Steil claimed that ""3.8% of Wisconsin’s coronavirus funding has been spent."" A report from the U.S. Department of Treasury said Wisconsin spent or transferred 3.8% of its CARES Act funds from March 1 to June 30. But that figure doesn’t account for expenses the state already incurred or funds it has committed to other programs and response efforts. A statement is Half True when it’s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.  That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0D5A40>],/factchecks/2020/aug/07/bryan-steil/gop-lawmaker-only-tells-part-story-claim-wisconsin/

No, George Soros is not a Nazi who funds antifa
","A subset of misinformation about demonstrations that erupted across the United States in the wake of George Floyd’s death involve billionaire Democratic donor George Soros. We’ve debunked claims that Soros is leaving rocks for activists to cause damage in Los Angeles, among other cities. He isn’t providing ""Soros Riot Dance Squad"" buses to ferry people to protests. He’s not using Open Society Foundations, the philanthropic organization he founded, to fund ""the chaos"" in Minneapolis, where a police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck.  An image being shared on Facebook now makes another claim about Soros in connection with the protests. It appears to show a tweet from actor James Woods, who uses the social media platform to comment on current events.  ""This man funds #ANTIFA,"" the text says above two photos — one of Soros and one of a younger man in an SS uniform. ""He is a real #NAZI. His name is George Soros."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  As we’ve reported antifa — which stands for ""anti-fascist"" — is a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists. The Trump administration has blamed antifa for recent protests but government intelligence reports, media reports and experts haven’t produced any evidence that supports that claim.  We couldn’t find the tweet searching Woods’ account, but we’re fact-checking the claims that appear in the Facebook post. First, as we’ve previously reported, Soros was not a Nazi.  The person in the photo in the Facebook post is Oskar Groning, one of 300 Auschwitz staff members. Groning was a corporal in Adolf Hitler’s Waffen SS and he became known as the bookkeeper of Auschwitz. He was one of the last Germans to face war-crime charges connected to the Holocaust. Soros fled fascism. When the Nazis invaded Hungary, his father obtained false identities for Soros and his brother and Soros was sent to live with an agricultural official who passed him off as his Christian godson.  ""This is how Mr. Soros was able to survive the Nazi occupation,"" Open Society said in the statement. ""Mr. Soros was hiding from the Nazis in order to survive. To construe this in any other way is malicious, completely misleading, and, in fact, anti-Semitic."" Next, there is no evidence Soros ""funds antifa."" Open Society Foundations refuted the claim and said that neither Soros or Open Society fund antifa. In a statement, a spokesperson for the organization said the false claims ""touch on longstanding, often anti-Semtiic conspiracy theories.""   When Fox Business published a story in June about antifa and ""who funds it,"" the story noted that it’s a difficult question to answer. ""Little is known about who funds antifa activists, or how the groups get their resources,"" the story said. ""Antifa is not a single organization, and therefore, financial details, if any exist, are murky."" Mark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University who wrote ""Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,"" told PolitiFact that the Facebook post reflects ""an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that the right has launched at all kinds of radical organizing over the years."" ""Antifa groups do not have much in the way of funds,"" he said. ""The International Anti-Fascist Defence Fund exists to provide funds for medical or legal expenses of antifascists and those funds come from donations from allies but beyond that I’d imagine that whatever little money these groups have come from members themselves."" We couldn’t find any evidence that Soros has contributed to this fund.

No, a list of sex cases on Facebook is not from unsealed Ghislaine Maxwell records
","A post viewed at least 1 million times on Facebook claims that the names of some 90 politicians and other people — all implicated in sex crimes or accused of other sexual acts — were revealed in newly unsealed court documents involving Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell, the longtime companion of Jeffrey Epstein, the late disgraced financier, was recently arrested in New Hampshire on charges that she lured girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. The post, which misspells Maxwell’s first name, introduces the names with this statement: ""#GiselleMaxwellslist became unsealed some time yesterday and here's what happened while y'all were distracted by bullshit."" The post ends with: ""#thisisjustthebeginning."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no evidence linking the newly unsealed Maxwell documents with the list, which includes sex cases made public years or even decades ago. The list is a recitation of cases involving sex allegations that have no apparent connection to Epstein. According to official autopsy results, the 66-year-old Epstein hanged himself on Aug. 10, 2019, in a New York jail cell where he was being held on federal sex trafficking charges.  He had been accused of victimizing dozens of girls and women over many years. We’ve debunked several claims about Maxwell, the daughter of the late British publishing baron Robert Maxwell. She has pleaded not guilty and is being held in jail in New York City. The Facebook post was published July 31, the day after a judge unsealed dozens of court documents in civil litigation, which was settled in 2017, between Maxwell and one of Epstein’s accusers. Many news reports about the unsealing — including those by the Wall Street Journal, the Guardian, the Washington Post, Fox News and Bloomberg — made no mention of a lengthy list of other figures being named in the documents. We reviewed the 638 pages of documents, which were posted by Law & Crime, a court and legal news website founded by attorney and TV legal commentator Dan Abrams. The documents focus on the sexual abuse allegations against Epstein and Maxwell; we didn’t find any indication that they refer to cases listed in the Facebook post. The post lists some 90 names and sex-related allegations involving each of those people. The list includes Democratic and Republican politicians. But the cases listed in the post have been publicly known for years, or even decades, news reports show.  We’ve posted a list of the names, the allegations in the post and links to news reports about the cases. Some examples: ""Democratic Illinois State Representative, Keith Farnham, has resigned and was charged with possession of child pornography,"" the post says. Farnham resigned in 2014, was convicted of trafficking in child pornography over the internet and died in prison in 2017. ""Spokesperson for Subway, Jared Fogle, was convicted of distribution and receipt of child pornography and traveling to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor,"" the post says. The conviction, which actually included charges of repeatedly having sex with minors, was in 2015. Fogle was sentenced to more than 15 years in prison. ""Republican County Councilman Keola Childs pleaded guilty to molesting"" a child, the post says. Childs had served as a Republican on the Hawai'i County Council from 1992 to 1996. He pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a child in 2000 and served jail time. We rate the post False.

Connie Mack says, “I have always said that I would be for drilling”
","U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, running in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, held an event at a Miami gas station to urge the public to sign his petition calling for the Keystone XL Pipeline.

""I have always said that I would be for drilling,"" Mack said on April 5, 2012, according to the Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog. ""But I think that’s an issue the state should have a say in – in determining how far it’s going to be off the coast of Florida. We ought to allow the state to have a say in that decision.""

The report pointed out several past quotes from Mack bashing proposals for drilling close to Florida.

We decided to put the issue to our Truth-O-Meter: Was Mack mischaracterizing his own past statements when he said he ""always"" was for drilling? When he wasn't for drilling As we investigated, we found that when then-state Rep. Mack ran for Congress in 2004, he pledged to maintain the ban on drilling off Florida’s coast. And if there was a high point to him sticking to that pledge, it was 2005.

That year, Mack issued multiple statements criticizing a proposal to allow drilling closer to Florida, saying that it would hurt Florida’s ""pristine"" or ""fragile"" coastline and describing it as ""risky"" and ""reckless.""

In a statement on Sept. 28, 2005, Mack called himself a ""longtime opponent of drilling off Florida’s coast.""  Yes, Congress needed to take action to lower gas prices, he said. ""But allowing drilling off Florida’s pristine coastline won’t reduce America’s pain at the pump. Instead of taking steps that will expose Florida’s fragile environment and our economy to severe and irreparable harm, we would be better served by expanding America’s refining capabilities, investing in new energy technologies, furthering commercial and consumer adoption of more energy efficient products, and increasing conservation.""

We found similar statements from Mack in 2005 on Sept. 29, Oct. 3, Oct. 24, Oct. 26, Nov. 3 and Nov. 10. Cracks in the opposition Mack continued his opposition in 2006, saying in May, ""I applaud my colleagues for saying (no to) reckless plans that could have allowed drilling as close as three miles off Florida’s shores.""

But 2006 was the year that the Florida delegation started to split on drilling. Before then, the delegation had nearly unanimous bipartisan opposition to drilling, said Mark Ferrulo, executive director of Progress Florida, who has tracked drilling legislation since the 1990s. (The exception: U.S. Rep. John Mica, R-Winter Park. ""His brother is a lobbyist for the oil industry, and (he) doesn’t have a coastline that was threatened,"" Ferrulo said.)

In June 2006, a vote was held on the the Deep Oceans Energy Resources Act, to create a smaller, 50-mile buffer on Florida’s coast. Fourteen of Florida’s 25-member House delegation voted in favor of the smaller zone, but Mack voted against it. He said in a press release that he voted against it because an amendment wasn’t included in the bill that would have given Florida control over drilling decisions.

In December, the House overwhelmingly voted for a bill that was considered a compromise: It opened up 8.3 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to drilling while protecting Florida’s 125-mile buffer.

Mack explained his support: ""I’m pleased the House has adopted important legislation that will codify new and stronger protections against offshore drilling for Florida’s Gulf Coast. Without enacting these protections, Florida faced a precarious future on the question of drilling off our fragile shore.

""While I would have preferred a solution that empowered states like Florida to determine their own destiny on this important issue, today’s legislation provides a sound solution that will protect our precious environment and our economy.""

A switch in position

Flash forward to the summer of 2008. Consumers were angry about $4-a-gallon gas, and the phrase ""drill, baby, drill"" was a Republican mantra. Presidential candidate John McCain called for lifting the federal moratorium along the Outer Continental Shelf and giving states incentives to lift the ban. Some Republicans, including then-Gov. Charlie Crist, who was a contender to be McCain’s vice president, and U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Fla., ditched their previous opposition. And so did Mack.

Mack told Fox News on June 16 that the United States needed to expand domestic production, including drilling off the coast of Florida. 

He explained his change of mind in a June 17 press release: ""For years I have said states should have the right to decide whether or not they want to allow drilling off their shores. But circumstances have changed, I have changed, and I believe the people of Florida have changed. We’re facing a serious energy emergency, and we need to take real steps to bolster our energy independence and security. The people of Florida deserve the right to decide whether to drill off our coast."" The political winds had shifted. ""Prior to now, this was not an issue that elected officials really wanted to engage in,"" said Justin Sayfie, a former spokesman for former Gov. Jeb Bush, at the time. ""I just think it speaks volumes about the pain at the pump that motorists are feeling."" Then came the Deepwater Horizon explosion and spill in 2010. Mack took a cautious approach, saying before a decision is made on banning offshore drilling, the country must understand what went wrong. But generally, he still supported offshore drilling, saying in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference that domestic drilling needed to continue ""across the United States and in our waters.""

Mack campaign spokesman David James sent us a statement acknowledging that Mack’s views have ""evolved"" on drilling.

""Connie has been a steadfast proponent of a strong national security and has always supported increasing our domestic energy supply by drilling in ANWR (the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge), and he has been a champion of building the Keystone XL Pipeline,"" James said. ""At the same time there's no dispute that Connie has always wanted to make certain that we protect Florida's shores. That hasn't changed. But four years ago, in the summer of 2008, Connie announced that his position with respect to drilling off Florida's coast evolved as our national energy security needs changed too. That's been well documented. And those needs have only grown all the more important.""

We are focusing our evaluation of Mack on drilling near Florida -- not Alaska -- since he is a congressman running for Senate in Florida. But we will briefly note his position on ANWR. For the years that drilling in ANWR appears on the scorecards of the League of Conservation Voters, it shows that Mack consistently voted as the League calls it ""anti-environment"" -- including in 2005 and 2006 and 2011. Mack was absent for that vote in 2008, but in an article that year he denounced a plan to impose restrictions on drilling in ANWR.

In 2012, Florida’s congressional delegation remains split on more drilling off the coast of Florida.

""We have never gotten back to a unified front of opposition against expanding drilling,"" Ferrulo said.

Our ruling

Mack said, ""I have always said that I would be for drilling. But I think that’s an issue the state should have a say in – in determining how far it’s going to be off the coast of Florida. We ought to allow the state to have a say in that decision.""

But Mack didn’t always say he was in favor of drilling. In 2005, he repeatedly said he was against allowing drilling closer to Florida’s shores. He has since changed his stance, as did many other Republicans in 2008 amid high gas prices and a presidential campaign. ""Always"" means at all times -- not sometimes, or the past few years, or in Alaska. At one time, Mack very much opposed drilling off Florida's coast. His comment that he's ""always"" been for drilling misrepresents his actual record on a very high-profile issue in the state of Florida.  We rate his statement Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4AC0C0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/25/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-i-have-always-said-i-would-be-dri/

Facebook post says Bank of America bonuses are big enough to create 878,300 jobs
","
We recently noticed a Facebook post that channeled popular anger over bonuses for people who work in the financial industry.

It said: ""Bank of America could create 878,300 jobs with benefits if they spent their 2010 bonuses on job creation.""

We wondered if that was accurate.

After some Internet searching, we found what appeared to be the source of this factoid. It’s a report called ""Big Banks, Bonus Bonanza,"" released by a coalition of five groups, led by the Service Employees International Union, or SEIU. Here’s an excerpt:

""Despite unleashing havoc on the global economy, Wall Street is once again getting ready to pay astronomical bonuses this year. The nation’s six largest banks alone are on track to pay their bankers a staggering $143 billion in bonuses, benefits and compensation (""bonus and compensation""), more than enough to fill the $130 billion total budget gap for all 50 states in (fiscal year) 2011. If Wall Street pumped this money directly into the economy instead of paying it to its bankers, it could create 3.6 million new jobs, and lower the unemployment rate by 2.3 percent. Bank of America tops the list, with $35 billion in bonuses and compensation set aside for its bankers.""

At the end of the report, the authors added an appendix titled ""Potential Job Creation by Bank.""

The appendix said, ""See below to see how many good-paying jobs with benefits big banks could create if they spent their bonus on job creation instead of banker bonuses."" In a footnote, the authors added that the figures are ""based on a cost of $40,000 per job,"" although they don't say why $40,000 was chosen.

The figure listed for Bank of America? Exactly 878,300 jobs -- essentially the result you get if you divide $35.1 billion by $40,000.

But there’s a problem. We were confused by the report’s use of the words ""bonus and compensation,"" since the Facebook post (and the SEIU appendix) referred only to ""bonuses.""

It turns out that the $35.1 billion figure is not simply bankers’ bonuses -- it’s all compensation paid by the company (encompassing salaries, benefits and bonuses) to every employee of Bank of America. That means it includes all compensation paid to executives, tellers, janitors and anyone else you can imagine who works for BofA.

The $35.1 billion figure can be found in table 5 on page 27 of the 2011 Bank of America annual report. We confirmed with a company spokesman as well as two outside experts that ""noninterest expense"" for ""personnel"" -- which is how the annual report labels the $35.1 billion figure -- means salaries, benefits and bonuses for everyone employed worldwide at Bank of America.

Knowing all this, we can calculate how many jobs $35.1 billion in compensation actually created. It’s 288,000 -- the current number of employees at Bank of America.

What if you just looked at bonuses alone? How many $40,000 jobs could you get from just by divvying up the company’s bonus pool?

The company doesn’t officially release its bonus data, but we did find a Bloomberg news report that estimated that Bank of America paid its investment banking employees about $4.4 billion in bonuses for 2009, citing ""a person close to the bank.""

Dividing this bonus pool into $40,000 increments gets you 110,000 jobs, far less than the 878,300 claimed in the Facebook post, though it’s quite a bit more than the 10,000 people the investment-banking unit actually employs -- many of whom probably earn more than $40,000.

Our ruling

The Facebook post -- and the SEIU report it was almost certainly based on -- incorrectly said that a pot of money consisted of bonuses when it in fact included all forms of compensation for all employees at the company. That made the mathematical calculation meaningless. Using just the company’s investment banking bonuses would create 110,000 jobs costing $40,000 for a year -- only one-eighth the number claimed in the post. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A469C0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/25/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-bank-america-bonuses-are-big-en/

Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch says her ‘cold call’ persuaded an Illinois company to relocate to Wisconsin
","
Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch says she’s on a jobs mission. Since taking office in January 2011,  she’s held small business roundtable discussions throughout the state and engaged in other efforts to boost the state’s business climate.

One of the strategies: Picking up the phone.

""Right after I was elected I started making cold calls down to Illinois,"" Kleefisch told talk show host Charlie Sykes on March 28, 2012. ""The fact is, my method has met with some serious successes.""

Then she got specific: ""You’ll remember that Fox Business News live streamed the move of one of the companies I called from Rockton, Illinois, to Beloit, Wisconsin.""

Kleefisch is facing a June 5, 2012, recall election. And, like Gov. Scott Walker, she has gone on the offensive, particularly on the jobs issue.

""It kind of silenced the critics who said it was beneath the lieutenant governor to make cold calls,"" Kleefisch said on the radio. ""Because how could something possibly be beneath a leader if it works and it brings jobs to the state?""

Said Kleefisch spokeswoman Jeanne Tarantino: ""Had she not done this, (they) would have gone to another state. That’s pretty obvious.""

Let’s take a closer look at Kleefisch’s claim.

The company in question is FatWallet.com, an online business that helps consumers find coupon deals. FatWallet receives commissions from companies such as Amazon.com and Newegg.com each time a customer clicks through to one of those big sites.

Its headquarters was an almost-new $5 million high-tech building the company had constructed in the village of Rockton, Ill., a few miles from the Wisconsin border.

In January 2011, the Illinois legislature passed a bill that would tax online retailers like Amazon if they had a retail presence in the state -- including an ""affiliate,"" or partner, such as FatWallet. State officials said Illinois is losing $150 million a year in sales tax revenue to online firms. They also wanted to protect local companies who are losing sales to online retailers.

After the law was passed Jan. 6, 2011, Amazon and other firms threatened to cut off business from companies like FatWallet.com as of April 15, 2011, if the measure was signed by Gov. Pat Quinn.

""I feel like I’ve been completely flipped the bird,"" FatWallet founder and CEO Tim Storm told the Chicago Tribune after the measure passed. ""Essentially, 30 to 40 percent of our revenue gets shut off instantaneously.""

He also said: ""The reality is that as a business owner with 52 employees, we're not going to just get shut down because of a law Illinois passes. Our customers don't care whether we're in the state of Illinois.""

So, that gave Wisconsin an opening -- a big one. Indeed, it would be two months before Quinn signed the measure on March 10, 2011.  

Tarantino said Kleefisch spoke to Storm on the phone during the first week in March 2011, and he visited her office in Madison on March 15.

""She told him about the reforms in place in Wisconsin"" and that the Walker administration had no plans to enact a similar tax, she said.

Storm had considered moving the company to Las Vegas or Florida to escape the Illinois sales tax law, said FatWallet spokesman Brent Shelton. But Wisconsin was a lot closer, a move to Beloit was less expensive and disruptive, he said.

""We were already considering Wisconsin before she called,"" Shelton said.

So that suggests Kleefisch’s role was far from pivotal.

Here is the look at the sequence of what happened.

September 2010: Storm contacts the city of Beloit and asks about space in a city-owned building downtown, according to Beloit economic development director Andrew Janke. That inquiry comes after the Illinois Legislature briefly considered -- but didn’t pass -- the Internet tax law.

First week of March 2011: Kleefisch, who was elected with Walker in November 2010, contacts FatWallet. Her office did not provide an exact date.

March 10, 2011: Quinn signs the measure into law.

March 11, 2011: Storm tweets: ""@GovWalker would you like @FatWallet, the #20 best small business to work in the nation to cross the border to WI? Let's chat.""

March 12, 2011: Storm tweets:  ""What a difference 5 miles makes.""

March 15, 2011: Kleefisch meets with Storm in Madison. City of Beloit officials invite Storm to consider leasing the city-owned space there. Kleefisch and other state officials were not involved with the offer made to FatWallet.

March 22, 2011: Gov. Walker tweets at Storm: ""Good talking w/u. Welcome 2 WI. We r not going 2 raise taxes as it would drive jobs out. We want u 2 grow here.""

March 25, 2011: FatWallet strikes a deal with Beloit to lease the city space. The City Council held a special meeting -- it was a Friday night -- to approve a one-year lease. The lease was renewed for another year in February 2012. The company pays rent of $7,716 a month.

April 8, 2011: The company moves five miles north, across the border to Beloit. Once the move was planned, Shelton alerted Fox Business News, and the channel jumped on the story and televised the event live, saying a growing Internet company was forced to relocate  because of the new Illinois sales tax law.

Kleefisch was waiting with an ""Open for Business"" sign when the caravan of FatWallet employees and the television crew arrived at the Beloit office. During the live broadcast, Kleefisch was asked by the Fox reporter about the cold call she made to Storm.

""It worked,"" she said that day. ""You can see it coming to fruition today.""

Shelton, the company spokesman, described an important -- but very limited -- role for Kleefisch in convincing the company to move to Wisconsin.  

""She was very instrumental in making verbal promises that these kind of taxes would not be passed on his (Walker’s) watch,"" he said.  

A few footnotes:

FatWallet received no economic assistance from the state of Wisconsin for making the move to Beloit, and the state did not play a role in securing the lease in Beloit, according to all parties involved, including Kleefisch’s office.

Shelton said the national publicity stirred by the move led to a sharp increase in the company’s sales.

On Sept. 9, 2011, Storm sold FatWallet to San Francisco-based Ebates.com. Storm left the company but remains as a part-time consultant and chairman. The company’s Rockton office space was owned by another business run by Storm and not FatWallet.

""That’s what businesses do, they take advantage of an opportunity,"" said Rockton, Ill., Mayor Dale Adams.

Our conclusion

Kleefisch says she ""cold called"" FatWallet.com and persuaded the company to move from Illinois to Wisconsin. There’s no question that she made the call and that she met with the company’s CEO.

But the wheels were turning for FatWallet to move months earlier. Indeed, the company had already inquired about office space in Beloit. (Employees could literally see Wisconsin from their Rockton building). The short move allowed the company to avoid the Illinois sales tax, and ensured that its employees didn’t have to pull up roots.

It’s clear from the chain of events that the state -- and Kleefisch -- played a minimal role in encouraging FatWallet to move to Wisconsin. But they certainly did not play the pivotal role, as Kleefisch suggested.

We rate her claim Mostly False. 
(You can comment on this item on the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's website) 
(Editor's note, May 15, 2012) In a new TV ad, launched May 9, 2012, Kleefisch makes a similar claim to the one we evaluated and in materials supporting the ad her campaign indicates she first spoke with a company representative in January of 2011 -- not March as her spokesman told us. Since the claim related to her role in convincing the business to move here, not when she made her first call, it does not change our rating.

Sheila Oliver says the average family income in New Jersey is $57,000
","
Democrats in Trenton scoffed when Gov. Chris Christie unveiled a proposal to cut income taxes by 10 percent, saying property taxes are more of a burden for New Jersey residents.

Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex) reiterated that point during a recent radio interview.

""In New Jersey our constituents want to see the Legislature and the governor focus on cutting the property taxes. The average New Jerseyan pays close to $8,000 a year and that is just average,"" Oliver told Steve Adubato Jr. on WOR-AM on April 19.

""The proposal to cut income taxes by 10 percent, if you took a family with an average income of $50,000 -- which, by the way, $57,000 is the mean in our state -- that would provide $80 over a three-year period in the pockets of a New Jersey family. That is not anything of significance. We say that won't buy a bag of groceries for a working-class family,"" Oliver said.

We previously checked a statement about potential savings from the governor’s income tax cut proposal. It’s true a couple with a taxable income of $50,000 would pay about $80 less in income taxes under Christie’s plan.

But is Oliver right that the average family in New Jersey lives on $57,000 a year?

We should note that economists generally prefer median income to mean income, since the mean income can be skewed by extremes, such as very high-income earners.

Robert Bernstein, a spokesman for the U.S. Census Bureau, said since the mean can be distorted ""it's not a good reflection of the situation there. Median is better.""

The median income is the amount in the middle when a series of numbers are ordered smallest to largest.

By either measure, Oliver is wrong.

The mean family income in New Jersey was $106,125 in 2010, according to the most recent data available from the American Community Survey, a yearly national assessment conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The median family income, according to the same survey, was $82,427.

Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, told us Oliver meant to refer to the annual average wage in New Jersey, not the average family income.

There’s a significant difference between the two.

The annual average wage is calculated by determining the total amount of wages paid out in a year and dividing by all the workers covered by the state’s unemployment insurance system who got a paycheck.

The figure is ""based on workers employed at New Jersey companies, those workers may or may not be New Jersey residents,"" Brian Murray, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, said in an e-mail.

According to a state labor department report released in 2011, the annual average wage in New Jersey was $56,385 in 2010.

Our ruling

Oliver said, ""$57,000 is the mean [income] in our state"" for a family.

That’s not true. The mean family income in New Jersey in 2010 was $106,125 and the median income, a measure less influenced by very high-income earners, was $82,427.

We rate Oliver’s statement False.

Mayor orders camera off at council meeting
","Meetings of the Cumming City Council rarely make the evening news, but that changed last week with video of a woman being tossed out of the public gathering.

The woman, Nydia Tisdale, was attempting to film the council’s meeting April 17, but she was told that was not going to happen.

""We don’t allow filming inside of the City Hall here,"" Mayor H. Ford Gravitt said, ""unless there is a specific reason.""

PolitiFact Georgia thought the mayor’s statement was odd, considering our reporters have covered countless City Council meetings throughout the Atlanta region.

The city of Cumming is a political subdivision that must abide by the laws of the state of Georgia, which has clear guidelines that generally allow meetings of elected officials to be recorded on video. When the mayor uses the collective ""we"" in his statement, he is speaking as the elected head of the city.

We wondered whether the mayor had a basis for his objection and decided to put it up for a vote on our Truth-O-Meter.

In a strange bit of timing, Tisdale was tossed from the council meeting on the same day Gov. Nathan Deal signed House Bill 397, a revised state law on open meetings and records aimed at providing greater access to documents and public meetings.

Tisdale, apparently, likes to use the laws to keep others informed about what’s going on in Forsyth County. She has a YouTube channel that includes a recording of a contentious Forsyth County Planning Commission meeting and video of candidate forums.

Tisdale was asked to turn off her camera at one Planning Commission meeting because one of the members was distracted by Tisdale holding the camera while speaking to the board. She declined to do so, and she began to recite the state’s open meetings laws.

""That’s fine,"" the official said.

Tisdale was recording the April 17 council meeting for nearly two minutes before it started. Once Gravitt called the meeting to order, he turned his attention to Tisdale. The mayor asked the police chief to have the camera removed.

""Respectfully, mayor, Georgia’s sunshine laws ..."" Tisdale says on the recording.

""It’s not for discussion,"" Gravitt says, waving his hands.

""I’m expressing my right as a citizen to record this meeting,"" Tisdale says as the camera shakes and her voice rises. ""Sir, this is an open, public meeting.""

Gravitt tells Tisdale she’s allowed to take notes.

Tisdale responds by saying the city is violating the state’s open meetings law. She eventually turns off her video camera after being removed from the meeting.

So was this a violation of the Georgia Open Meetings Act?

As promised, Tisdale filed a complaint with the state. The Georgia Attorney General’s Office sent Cumming City Attorney Dana Miles a letter dated April 19 that said ""Georgia law expressly allows video recording of public meetings.""

Title 50, Section 14 of the Georgia Open Meetings Act states that ""[v]isual, sound, and visual and sound recording during open meetings shall be permitted"" at city council and other meetings. The act does not apply when governing bodies are discussing the acquisition of real estate, records that are not allowed for public inspection and most personnel matters.

The mayor told Fox 5 Atlanta that he ordered the video camera turned off because of safety concerns.

""I think if it's a safety issue, and you have people running over you maybe in a case of emergency, I think you can use some common sense,"" Gravitt said.

He added: ""Visual and sound equipment, it may be permitted. Well, you know, it's a little gray area there. I see it.""

Gravitt declined our request to talk about this, saying his attorneys have advised him not to do any more interviews.

Hollie Manheimer, executive director of the Georgia First Amendment Foundation, said the state’s open meetings laws specify that government meetings are allowed to be recorded.

""The point of the Open Meetings Act is to allow an educated public to make informed decisions by way of watching its elected officials at public meetings,"" she said. ""This legislative session, in particular, we all spent so much time on redrafting the statute -- all with the intent of maximizing public access.""

Manheimer said the past and revised code had similar language that allows city council and other meetings to be recorded.

The state’s open meeting laws specifically state that city council meetings can be video recorded, excluding some specific instances.

The beginning of this Cumming City Council meeting did not seem to be one of those special cases. We rate the mayor’s claim as False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A58680>],/factchecks/2012/apr/25/h-ford-gravitt/mayor-orders-camera-council-meeting/

University of Florida eliminates computer science department, increases athletic budgets, blogger says
","
Even the most die-hard Gators sports fan would probably agree: giving the athletic program at the University of Florida close to $100 million while cutting an engineering program to save a little more than $1 million doesn’t seem quite fair. 
Yet that was the claim, widely circulated in an online Forbes magazine post over the weekend headlined ""University of Florida Eliminates Computer Science Department, Increases Athletic Budgets. Hmm."" 
""The University of Florida announced this past week that it was dropping its computer science department,"" the blog post said. ""Meanwhile, the athletic budget for the current year is $97.7 million, an increase of more than $2 million from last year. The increase alone would offset the savings supposedly gained by cutting computer science."" 
The article, written by Forbes contributor Steven Salzberg, a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Medicine, quickly gained traction on social networking sites, getting posted, re-posted and commented on hundreds of times. Salzberg said even he was surprised at the attention it got. 
But is the claim true? Is UF really cutting computer science to save the same amount of money that it's adding to athletics? Couldn’t the university use the extra sports money to fund the academic program? 
It's true that UF is struggling with budget cuts while athletic funding is up. But the blog post details are questionable. The computer science program isn't going away, for example. And it's not quite so easy for the university to move money from athletics to academics. 
Salzberg told us he got his information from various news articles and the UF athletic budget, which he found by searching online. Budget documents for the UF Athletic Association show that total expenditures for 2011-2012 were $97.7 million, about $2 million more than the year before. 
Meanwhile, UF is attempting to save $1.4 million by overhauling one of its engineering departments. But the department, Computer & Information Science and Engineering, isn’t being eliminated. Instead, UF is considering merging it with another department, Electrical and Computer Engineering. No one's major would change, and course offerings would remain the same.  
But many of the program’s teaching assistant positions would be eliminated, with faculty taking on a greater teaching role in the consolidation, the university says. The idea sparked campus protests when it was made public a couple weeks ago.  
It’s part of a total $4 million cut that the engineering college has to deal with, its share of a $36.4 million cut to the university — which is UF’s share of a $300 million cut to higher education statewide. 
Cammy Abernathy, dean of UF’s engineering college, said she understands people’s frustrations. Nobody likes budget cuts, she told PolitiFact Florida. ""It’s painful."" 
Still, she believes the reorganization would make the best of the situation. ""We looked for areas where we had duplication or overlap,"" Abernathy said. 
That sentiment was echoed in a statement released by UF, in response to the Forbes article: 
""The Dean of the College of Engineering has put on the table for discussion a budget plan to reorganize the Computer & Information Science and Engineering Department. Under that proposal, all undergraduate and graduate degree curriculum would remain the same and the college would maintain its brainpower and research capacity. The plan calls for no lay-offs of tenure-track faculty."" 
But what about that athletic budget? Surely UF could use that extra couple million out of the athletic association’s total $97 million to bolster engineering, right? 
Not exactly, says UF. 
The athletic association is a separate, nonprofit entity from the university and does not receive direct state funds. Its money comes from ticket sales, donations, Southeastern Conference revenues and student fees of about $2 per credit hour. 
UF President Bernie Machen has no authority over the association’s budget, said university spokeswoman Janine Sikes. ""It is a separate organization with a separate board,"" she said. 
If the association wants to contribute to UF, that’s up to them. And it regularly does so, giving the university more than $60 million since 1991 for academics. Last year, it gave $6 million, paying for things like scholarships, campus events and updates to facilities. 
The association can’t give academics an unlimited amount, Sikes said. Not only does the program require money to operate, but many boosters are specific about wanting to donate to UF sports. 
After many commenters on the Forbes article made the same points, Salzberg added a clarification. But he maintains that the athletic association director reports to the university president, and as such, Machen should be able to direct those athletic funds however he wants.  
""He’s out of his mind to allow this to happen,"" Salzberg responded to a commenter.  
And if Machen isn’t doing anything about it, perhaps Gov. Rick Scott should, Salzberg said. After all, Salzberg points out, Scott just approved the creation of the state’s 12th university, Florida Polytechnic, which will be built in Lakeland under the flag of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. 
""Heads up, Gov. Scott: no one is going to believe that you’re supporting technical education when your flagship university is eliminating its Computer Science Department,"" Salzberg wrote. 
Scott’s office wasn’t crazy about that suggestion, also issuing a response to the Forbes piece. 
""It would be nice if Gov. Scott could make spending decisions for the universities, but that’s not the way our system is set up,"" said Lane Wright, a governor’s office spokesman. ""In the meantime all he can do is what he has been doing, which is urging them to focus on programs that will give graduates hope of actually getting a job."" 
Salzberg told Politifact Florida that the intent of his piece was to illustrate what he sees as hypocrisy by Scott and other state leaders — cutting the budget of a well-established engineering program while committing to a new university that’s likely to require more, not less, state resources in the future. 
It’s a compelling overall idea, but some of the finer points are a bit stretched. The university is considering consolidating programs, not eliminating computer science entirely. And the funds for academics and athletics aren’t easily moved around.

"['National', 'Jobs', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says Hispanic unemployment has risen under Barack Obama
","
In a mid April Pew poll, Mitt Romney trailed President Barack Obama among Hispanic voters, who gave the president a whopping 67 percent to 27 percent margin. In an effort to bolster his standing with this key electoral group, Romney’s campaign on April 20, 2012, released a statistical graphic that takes a shot at Obama’s record on Hispanic unemployment.

Among the statistics cited was this one: ""The total unemployment rate for Hispanic or Latino workers has increased from 10% to 10.3%."" The time frame was between January 2009 and March 2012.

We decided to take a closer look.

We turned to unemployment data produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official agency for such numbers. We found that the Hispanic unemployment rate in January 2009 was indeed 10.0 percent, and the rate in March 2012 -- the most recent month available -- was 10.3 percent.

But that isn’t the whole story.

Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009, about two-thirds of the way through the month. One could just as easily have considered the first month on his watch to be February 2009 -- the first month during which he was president for the entire time. And if you start the clock in February 2009, just one month later, the picture is significantly different.

In February 2009, the Hispanic unemployment rate was 11.1 percent. Using that as the baseline, Hispanic unemployment fell by eight-tenths of a percentage point by March 2012 -- instead of rising three-tenths of a percentage point.

The fact that there is a major difference if you move the starting point by just one month is not surprising. Hispanics are heavily represented in the construction industry, a sector that was hit unusually hard in the first year of the recession.

Indeed, job prospects for Hispanics were in a free fall by the time Obama took office. In the year-long span between January 2008 and January 2009 -- a period when George W. Bush was president -- Hispanic unemployment rose from 6.5 percent to 10.0 percent, far faster than it did during Obama’s tenure even if you do begin counting in January 2009.

The point isn't that starting the count in February is vastly superior to starting in January. But when two plausible options offer such widely divergent results, picking the one that spins the claim in a way much more favorable to Romney is clearly cherry-picking.

In the meantime, there’s also an argument -- one we’ve made before -- that it’s unfair to blame Obama for job losses very early in his term. In fact, the pattern seen when you start in February only gets stronger the further you go into Obama’s first year. If you start counting six months into his tenure, the reduction in Hispanic unemployment on his watch has been 2.2 percentage points, and if you start counting nine months into his tenure, it's been 2.7 percentage points -- a sharply different scenario than the one in Romney’s graphic.

One additional factor: There’s a lot of uncertainty in the data that casts doubt on whether it can be used to support sweeping conclusions.

When you slice the monthly unemployment data by ethnic groups, such as Hispanics, ""the sample sizes become small enough to introduce a fair amount of sampling error into the resulting statistics,"" said Steven J. Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who served as an outside adviser to John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign.

Davis noted that according to BLS, the approximate margin of error for the monthly unemployment rate for Hispanics is 0.34. That’s more than twice as wide as the margin of error for the measurements of men and women, and more than three times as wide as the margin of error for unemployment figures for the population as a whole.

So in reality, the January 2009 figure might have been as high as 10.3 percent instead of 10 and the March 2012 figure could have been as low as 10 percent instead of 10.3. (Or it could have risen from 9.7 percent to 10.6 percent over the same period -- we just don’t know.)

""It is hard to say whether the January or February 2009 data provide a more accurate indication of the likely Hispanic unemployment rate at the beginning of the Obama Administration,"" Davis said. ""Similar points apply to the March 2012 measure.""

Our ruling

The Romney campaign said that ""the total unemployment rate for Hispanic or Latino workers has increased from 10% to 10.3%"" between January 2009 and March 2012. The numbers the Romney team cites are accurate, but they may not be statistically significant, and if you use equally plausible time frames, the numbers tell a dramatically different story. These amount to missing critical facts that would have given a different impression. That's our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809719F280>],/factchecks/2012/apr/24/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-hispanic-unemployment-has-risen-u/

The share of speculators in the oil market has doubled in the past 10 years, says Bill Nelson
","
What’s higher: the price of gas, or blame for it?

President Barack Obama and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, are among those who say they’ve found the culprit behind $4-a-gallon fill-ups.

Nelson vented about ""a new brand of oil trader,"" called a speculator, in an April 16, 2012, POLITICO opinion column. He likened speculators’ marketplace activities to gambling, but gambling that everyone pays for with higher fuel prices.

""One statistic is really telling: The share of the oil market controlled by speculators has more than doubled over the past 10 years,"" Nelson wrote. ""At the same time, gas has gone from $1.56 a gallon to an average of $3.90 or more a gallon.""

His column came the day before Obama announced a plan to increase regulation of the commodities market and strengthen penalties for those who manipulate it.

With renewed national attention on these traders, we wanted to know if Nelson’s stat was right, and look at his broader point that speculators are contributing to higher gas prices. 
* * * 
Let’s start with a few basics on buying and selling oil.

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission releases reports about the commodities marketplace each week. These reports lay out the quantity of contracts -- called ""futures"" -- for various commodities, including wheat, gold, sugar and crude oil, and what kind of users are holding them.

Traditional commercial traders, including airlines and farmers, use the exchange to buy or sell supplies in advance. They want to hedge their risk in an effort to avoid volatile prices down the road. They include oil producers, for example, who want to lock in prices and supplies for delivery at a future date.

Noncommercial traders buy and sell futures contracts without using them for business purposes -- they’re in it to make a profit. Nelson called them speculators or middle men. Technically, they’re more like investment banks and hedge funds.

""They are making bets on the prices of the physical commodities, but they are not actually buying the commodities,"" wrote Sheridan Titman, a University of Texas at Austin finance professor, in a blog post.

We asked Nelson’s office for evidence to back up his claim that speculation in the oil market has more than doubled over the past 10 years.

Using CFTC reports, Nelson’s team compared West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures contracts -- the benchmark for U.S. oil prices -- held by noncommercial traders to commercial traders. By that measure, the share of the market grew from 24.2 percent in 2002 to 56.9 percent in 2012, Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin said.

Nelson’s team said these numbers actually downplay the presence of speculators in the marketplace. They also pointed us to testimony from CFTC chairman Gary Gensler that at least 80 percent of trades in the oil market are made by speculators.

The Paris-based International Energy Agency, of which the United States is a member, agreed that the share of noncommercial trader has more than doubled but used a slightly different anlaysis. They found that noncommercial traders’ share of long open interest contracts increased 15 to 45 percent from 2000 to 2011, and short open interest grew 13 to 36 percent.

The U.S. is unique among regulators worldwide for publishing Commitment of Traders reports. Still, IEA spokesman Greg Frost said, there’s more to consider about the oil market than U.S. crude oil futures.

Nelson’s measure does not include the physical market, other oil markets, or Brent derivatives, which are the basis for European oil prices, Frost wrote in an email.

Other experts we talked to agreed that Nelson’s numbers were likely incomplete. But they also readily conceded that noncommercial trading has increased dramatically over the last decade. 
* * * 
Now for Nelson’s larger point: Are speculators driving up gas prices? We found opinions here run the gamut.

""I’m sure that speculative trading in oil has been increasing, but I don’t see any reason why that would push up oil prices,"" said Titman, the finance professor at the University of Texas at Austin. ""There is also a lot of speculative trading in natural gas, and those prices have been falling.""

Some said Nelson’s use of the word ""speculators"" is pejorative and ""fast and loose."" A noncommercial trader is not necessarily a speculator in a negative way, said Lutz Kilian, a University of Michigan economics professor.

""The real question is not whether there are many noncommercial traders in the market,"" he said, ""but whether these speculators somehow undermine the functioning of the oil futures market.""

So far, he said, pointing to a March 2012 study he co-authored, no one has proven that’s the case or adequately defined ""excessive speculation.""

Kilian further objected to Nelson’s claim that speculators have control over the market.

""I am not aware of any research study asserting or documenting that noncommercial traders ‘control’ the market,"" he said. ""That's simply the unsubstantiated opinion of the author.""

Others say the influx of big financial firms in the commodities market has grown too large and is undermining the markets.

Yes, speculators fulfill an important role by taking on risk that commercial traders want to shed, said Jim Collura, who handles public policy at the New England Fuel Institute, which represents heating fuel distributors. But the market turns volatile when speculators dramatically outnumbers hedgers and dominate the marketplace, and that’s what is happening now, he said.

The noncommercial traders bet more than what the crude is worth, which drives up the price, said Sean Cota, outgoing chairman of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, which represents gasoline stations, convenience stores, and heating oil businesses.

""A trader loves volatility,"" he said. ""If the price is the same every day they can’t make money.""

Information from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which conducts independent analyses for the U.S. Department of Energy, chronicled the growth of the crude oil futures contracts. In 2012, the amount of average daily open-interest contracts in crude oil futures in American exchanges was 1,475. That’s nearly three times as many contracts for the same period in 2002, when it was 496.

The agency’s analysis warned that a link between volatile energy prices and speculators is unproven despite growing research by scholars and securities analysts. Part of the problem? Most activity goes on in the over-the-counter derivatives market, which is less transparent, so more data is needed. 
* * * 
So what else could explain the volatility of gas prices when U.S. supply is up and demand is down?

Worldwide supply-and-demand has a lot to do with it, several experts said, pointing to the growing economies of China, India, Russia and Brazil.

""China has increased their consumption more than we’ve decreased ours,"" said James Hamilton, University of California-San Diego economics professor.

""My feeling is that a lot of these politicians are deliberately trying to steer that view and putting forward something else that appeals to people’s emotions,"" Hamilton said.

Sheridan Titman called blaming oil speculators ""the issue that will not go away"" -- in a blog post two years ago.

Our ruling

Nelson said, ""The share of the oil market controlled by speculators has more than doubled over the past 10 years."" The number is based on data collected by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But experts told us that measure doesn’t include the entire oil market.

Plus, Nelson’s implication is that the rise in noncommercial traders is directly related to the upswing in gas prices over 10 years. That’s a controversial notion, and, as an independent agency pointed out, unproven either way.

Kingston says oil production down last year under Obama
","
Savannah Congressman Jack Kingston is standing in line with other Republicans this presidential election season to hit President Barack Obama on a major talking point.

They’re pinning the blame for rising gas prices on Obama.

Kingston took his turn April 12 with an op-ed in his hometown paper, the Savannah Morning News.

""[W]hile families struggle with rising gas prices the president is only making things worse,"" the op-ed said.

""When he [Obama] claims energy production is increasing on his watch, he is taking credit for production on state and private lands. In fact, oil production on federal lands has decreased 14 percent over the past year.""

Oil production is down 14 percent on federal lands? We thought this claim was well worth a check.

Our colleagues at PolitiFact National and PolitiFact Ohio have looked at similar claims. Both teams cautioned against blaming a president for current oil production levels. Factors such as natural and man-made disasters, changes in technology and presidential policies dating back decades are also at play.  

""I don't think Obama can claim a lot of credit for production levels now, and I'm not even sure that [George W. Bush] can,"" Jay Hakes, who directed the independent U.S. Energy Information Administration for seven years during the Clinton administration, told PolitiFact National.

Hakes is author of ""A Declaration of Energy Independence,"" which looks at energy policy from President Harry S. Truman to President George W. Bush.

""If you're going to go back — who should get the credit — I might be able to find something that Nixon did,"" Hakes said.

PolitiFact Ohio addressed these factors when they looked into a March 26 statement by that state’s U.S. Sen. Rob Portman: ""Last year, we produced 14 percent less oil on public lands than we did the year before.""

They found it was Mostly True. They checked the number against data from the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue, which tracks royalties to the government for oil, gas and coal produced on federal lands and waters. They also cross-checked it against information from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which provides the federal government’s official energy statistics.

Although the number was accurate, Portman’s statement needed additional clarification or information. At least part of the drop on public lands and waters last fiscal year was due to the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and an apparent shift by oil companies to private lands for ""fracking."" (Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a method of extracting oil or gas that opens up rock with a pressurized mix of water and chemicals.)

About one week after PolitiFact Ohio’s story ran, Crossroads GPS, a conservative group, released a Web ad that tied Obama even more directly than Portman did to a decline in oil production.

The group said that oil ""production's down where Obama's in charge,"" and cited the 14 percent figure.  

PolitiFact National gave Crossroads GPS a Half True.

The 14 percent decline took place in a single year -- fiscal year 2011, or Oct. 1, 2010, through Sept. 30, 2011. This time period includes the aftermath of the deadly Deepwater Horizon oil spill of April 20, 2010.

The Department of the Interior issued a directive about a month after the disaster that said they would not consider drilling permits for deepwater wells for six months. Changes in federal regulations followed.

National also found the data Crossroads GPS used did not tell the whole story.

From fiscal year 2009 through 2011, crude oil sales from federal lands and waters did suffer a net decline of less than 1 percent, according to the Energy Information Administration. In 2009, oil production totaled 632 million barrels. In 2011, it was down to 626 million.

However, during the first two fiscal years, oil production rose. In 2010, those sales totaled 726 million, a year-over-year increase of 14.9 percent.

Furthermore, 2011’s 14 percent drop in production on federal lands and waters took place as onshore production rose slightly. Crude oil sales stood at 108 million barrels in 2010. They rose to 112 million barrels, an increase of 3.7 percent.  

We found that Kingston’s op-ed piece, which places the blame for gas prices squarely on Obama’s shoulders, shares these accuracy problems. He cited the 14 percent figure, saying Obama is ""only making things worse"" for families struggling with high gas prices.

His spokesman Chris Crawford argued the congressman’s claim deserves a True. The number is accurate, and Obama is saying energy production is up on his watch.

""I don't see how you can come to any conclusion but it being the truth,"" Crawford said in an email.

But we’re not rating Obama’s statements. We’re also not taking issue with Kingston’s oil production data.

Our issue is context, and that’s where Kingston runs into trouble. He cherry-picked the most unflattering oil production numbers under the Obama administration and ignored the impact of events well outside the president’s control: changes in technology, decades of presidential policy, and most importantly, the Deepwater Horizon spill.

Kingston’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. According to PolitiFact’s rules, this earns Kingston a Half True.

Campaigns like to highlight the number of donors and volunteers on board. The numbers can be a great gauge of a person’s grassroots support, although the figures may not have much bearing on whether that candidate wins.

State Rep. Mary Nolan, D-Portland, is no different in her campaign to unseat incumbent Amanda Fritz from the Portland City Council. On Nolan’s campaign website, she lists heavy-hitting endorsements from former Gov. Barbara Roberts and former Portland Mayor Vera Katz.

And this: ""Over 8,000 people have supported her campaign as volunteers, donors and advisors and endorsers.""

More than 8,000 individuals support Nolan? The number seemed a bit suspect for a City Council race. It’s a small matter, but if it’s meant to reflect broad support, we figured it was ripe for a fact check.

First, we checked with other Portland city candidates to get a ballpark feel. We started with the three main mayoral contenders.

Stacey Dycus, campaign director for candidate Jefferson Smith, said the campaign has 2,000 individual donors, 850 volunteers, and endorsements from 500 people. Of course, those numbers probably overlap.

Campaign manager Jessica Moskovitz said Charlie Hales’ campaign probably has about 4,000 people in the category of endorsers, volunteers, supporters and donors. We checked the list of supporters on his website and found at least 800 individual names.

Neel Pender, a spokesman for Eileen Brady, said such numbers can be fuzzy -- it’s all in how you count them after all -- but that ""8,000 seems high unless you count all the members of your endorsing organizations."" Brady’s website lists more than 700 individual names as supporters.

Again, we’re looking at magnitude, not exactitude. But it appears that 8,000 individual supporters is a big number for a citywide race.

KJ Lewis, Nolan’s campaign manager, cleared up the mystery behind the numbers pretty quickly for us. She explained that the campaign included the individual members of unions that have endorsed Nolan -- even if the individual might not support Nolan.

Is that fair?

""I think so, because they all contribute to their union so they have a collective voice; they have a process to decide who they are endorsing,"" Lewis said. ""I think a case could be made that the union members can be counted as supporters.

Let’s see which unions back Nolan, according to her website: International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW Local 48); American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME Local 189, AFSCME Local 328, AFSCME council 37); International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU Local 8 and state council); Service Employees International Union (SEIU Local 49).

Also, Portland firefighters and police. That’s a hefty list. Did the unions care that she was counting some of their members as individual supporters to boost her number?

""My members know she’s been a friend of the IBEW for many, many years,"" said Joe Esmonde, political director for electrical workers. ""I get elected and chosen to make these decisions and put it to the membership, and I’m down in the Capitol a lot and she has a 97 percent rating from the AFL-CIO, and she’s always been good to the building trades.""

Sure, he acknowledges that all 1,600 active members in Portland may not vote for her -- or vote at all -- but he’s OK with Nolan counting his people. So were other representatives we called. Of course, you’re probably thinking, what else would they say?

Fritz makes the point, rightly, that not all members of a union will support the endorsement. Nolan’s campaign website states that more than 8,000 people volunteer, donate, advise and endorse her. (By the way, the last time we checked Nolan had at least 280 individuals named as supporters on her website; Fritz had 480. We heart you Excel!)

Unions are valuable when it comes to campaigning on behalf of a candidate -- making phone calls, knocking on doors -- and donating political action committee money. But a union endorsement is not the same thing as getting support or money from the individuals who make up that union.

The statement is partially accurate in that certain unions with their memberships have endorsed Nolan. But the statement takes things out of context, in that the members have not all individually cited support for Nolan. We find her statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097231280>],/factchecks/2012/apr/24/mary-nolan/can-portland-city-council-candidate-mary-nolan-cou/

Obama says new miles of pipeline could stretch around the earth
","President Barack Obama kept up the drumbeat for his ""all of the above"" energy strategy with a speech in the White House Rose Garden.

Addressing criticism that he has stood in the way of domestic production, in the April 17, 2012, speech Obama said the opposite is true.

""There are politicians who say that if we just drilled more, then gas prices would come down right away. What they don’t say is that we have been drilling more. Under my administration, America is producing more oil than at any time in the last eight years. We’ve opened up new areas for exploration. We've quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some,"" Obama said, with a nod to middle-school science class.

We've been hearing a lot about oil production recently and have checked several statements from Obama and Republicans on the matter. Here, we decided to check something we haven't heard before -- that the United States has added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth since Obama took office.

First, it's important to note that it's unusual for presidents to become involved in decisions about pipeline construction, which is largely driven by whether the oil and gas industry is willing to make the large investment, an expert told us. Obama rejected an expedited plan pushed by Republicans to build the Keystone XL pipeline, but he has also emphasized the importance of pipeline construction. He has said that domestic production exceeds current pipeline capacity and in March signed an executive order streamlining the permitting and construction process of a new crude oil pipeline to Gulf Coast refineries. For this item, we’re not addressing whether Obama deserves credit for the pipeline because of the limited role presidents have. But we can check whether that much pipeline has been added. To back up Obama's claim, the White House pointed us to statistics from the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, which regulates pipelines.

The DOT figures were last updated in April 2012 with mileage figures through 2010. So they do not include pipeline that was added last year or this year.

Here's a comparison of the mileage at the end of 2008 (right before Obama took office) and the end of 2010:

Crude oil
2008: 50,963 miles
2010: 54,728 +3,765

Petroleum products
2008: 61,599
2010: 64,752 + 3,153

Natural gas transmission
2008: 303,182
2010: 304,691 + 1,509

Natural gas distribution
2008: 2,074,513
2010: 2,095,690 + 21,177

That adds up to 2,490,257 oil and gas pipeline miles in 2008, and 2,519,861 in 2010.

So that's 29,604 additional miles of pipeline. According to NASA, the equatorial circumference of the Earth is 24,873.6 miles. Obama's comparison is accurate, and given that the latest figures only cover through 2010, the real, current figure is likely higher.

We asked two experts if the year-to-year comparison of pipeline miles is a valid measure and if anything else should be considered.

Jay Hakes, former director of the Energy Information Administration under President Bill Clinton, said the data are reliable and ""as near as I can tell, the assertion is well documented and correct.""

Tadeusz Patzek, chair of the Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, pointed out that many miles of those pipelines are ""field/project gathering lines of small diameter and small throughput"" -- not large transmission lines many of us think of. He's right. According to the DOT numbers, 21,177 miles of the new pipeline are listed as natural gas distribution lines. Still, such lines are ""a necessary piece"" of the whole system. Said Patzek: ""Without the small stuff you’re not going to increase the flow rate through the large."" Is 29,604 miles over three years a lot? For some perspective, we looked at the miles added during the last three years of George W. Bush's presidency. They tell a wholly different story: 63,243 new miles of small natural gas distrbution lines -- more than Obama's overall total. But crude oil? Just 756 miles. Petroleum products: 808 fewer miles in 2005 than in 2007. We're not suggesting Obama has done better than Bush in this regard. The comparison simply reinforces the point that oil and gas supply and demand, and the industry's response to it, results from decisions made far from the White House.

Our ruling

Obama said the U.S. has added enough pipeline in the last three years to circle the Earth ""and then some."" He is right about the mileage, though it includes not just large interstate transmission lines but also small pipes that collect gas from groups of wells and feed to the larger lines. But those pipelines are a link in the grid, and Obama didn't specify only large transmission pipeline.

The statement is accurate. We rate it True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097802F00>],/factchecks/2012/apr/23/barack-obama/obama-says-new-miles-pipeline-could-stretch-around/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Poverty', 'Welfare', 'Tavis Smiley']","
Tavis Smiley says ""one out of two Americans … are living either in or near poverty""
","
On the April 22, 2012, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, PBS talk show host Tavis Smiley appeared alongside Cornel West, a professor at Princeton University and Union Theological Seminary, to discuss the book they co-wrote, The Rich And The Rest Of Us: A Poverty Manifesto.

Host Bob Schieffer kicked off the conversation about poverty in America by asking, ""How bad is it, Tavis?""

Smiley responded, ""It's horrible when one out of two Americans, Bob, are living either in or near poverty. That means 150 million Americans, half of us, are wrestling with this issue.""

A reader asked us if this was accurate, so we took a look.

We first turned to the official poverty statistics, which are collected by the Census Bureau. According to the most recent figures -- for 2010 -- 15.1 percent of Americans, or about 46 million people, are officially in poverty. That’s far below both the percentage and the raw number Smiley offered on television.

However, Smiley did say ""in or near poverty,"" so we checked that, too. The Census Bureau found that 104 million people are living at at twice the poverty level, or 33.9 percent of the population. That’s still short of the levels Smiley cited.

In fact, the national median household income for 2010 was $49,445. By comparison, a non-elderly household with two adults and one child would be at the poverty level if it had income of $15,030. To be ""in or near poverty"" according to Smiley's formulation would mean being about 3.3 times the official poverty level.

Calling those who are up to 300 percent of the poverty level near-poor ""is a stretch,"" said Andrew G. Biggs, a resident scholar the conservative American Enterprise Institute.

Michael Wiseman, a George Washington University economist, agreed, saying that ""‘near poverty"" is generally interpreted as having an income less than twice the poverty standard. … I know of no country in which all persons with incomes less than the median are considered poor or near-poor. Would this mean that all persons with incomes above the median should be considered rich or near-rich?""

There is one Census Bureau measure that supports Smiley’s claim -- an unofficial one.

Currently, poverty is measured by establishing a set of multiple income thresholds for families of different sizes and compositions, then comparing family incomes to those levels. Being in poverty means that you that have an income below the threshold for your family type. But for years, scholars have debated whether there is a better way to measure poverty than the official statistic. One of the efforts to test an alternative measurement is called the Supplemental Poverty Measure, or SPM.

The SPM doesn’t just consider cash earned but also in-kind transfers such as food stamps, net taxes paid, and medical and work-related expenses, such as child care and commuting costs, wrote University of Massachusetts-Amherst economist Nancy Folbre in a New York Times blog post. It also employs a ""new standard of need, linked to what low-income families actually spend,"" she wrote.

In 2010, a federal interagency working group gave a green light to calculating the statistic, but only as long as the long-standing poverty calculation retained its official status. The SPM ""will be an additional macroeconomic statistic providing further understanding of economic conditions and trends,"" the Census Bureau wrote.

In November 2011, the Census Bureau released an official report with SPM data for 2010. The poverty rate reported by the SPM was only a percentage point higher than the official rate, though different sub-groups fared differently. (Because of how the SPM is calculated, it showed lower poverty rates among children and higher rates among senior citizens.)

The important point for Smiley’s claim is that the SPM report found that just under 48 percent of the population had incomes at twice the poverty level or below -- a number in tune with Smiley’s claim that ""one out of two Americans … are living either in or near poverty.""

When we reached Smiley, he said that his claim on Face the Nation stemmed from the very first footnote of his and West’s book -- a CBS News report headlined ""Census data: Half of U.S. poor or low income."" A look at the CBS report confirmed that the number being cited was from the SPM, not the traditional poverty measure.

So Smiley has support for his number from Census Bureau statistics. However, in the context of a fast-paced television interview, some nuance got lost.

The statistic has not been received neutrally, said Douglas Besharov, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland who specializes in children and poverty. He said that ""liberals like"" the SPM while ""conservatives dislike"" it.

Given the nature of the statistic as new and unofficial, economists we interviewed agreed that it would have been more appropriate if Smiley had specified that he was using an alternative measure. Otherwise, viewers would think he’s talking about official poverty statistics.

""It strikes me as a very, very good idea to make clear to listeners when one is citing this new measure,"" said Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute agreed. ""If someone wants to use the alternate measure, I think they should be clear that it’s not the official poverty line they’re using,"" he said.

Our ruling

The Census Bureau has produced a number that supports Smiley’s claim that ""one out of two Americans … are living either in or near poverty. That means 150 million Americans, half of us."" However, it is not the Census Bureau’s official measure of poverty; that statistic would have shown no more than one-third of Americans to be near-poor. Failing to mention that it’s an alternative statistic may leave a misleading impression with viewers. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C01CEC0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/23/tavis-smiley/tavis-smiley-says-one-out-two-americans-are-living/

Ted Nugent says four justices declared Americans have 'no fundamental right to self-defense'
","
Conservative rocker Ted Nugent, a board member of the National Rifle Association since 1995, throws his ""fire-breathing intensity"" behind his guitar — and the Second Amendment.

On April 14, 2012, his NRA convention rhetoric caught the attention of the Secret Service, but the provocative speech — which was largely a call to action to get out the vote for Mitt Romney — also included some checkable facts about gun rights.

One that caught our eye: ""We’ve got four Supreme Court justices who … signed their name to a declaration that Americans have no fundamental right to self-defense.""

Here’s the setup: 
We’ve got four Supreme Court justices who don’t believe in the Constitution. Does everybody know here that four of the Supreme Court justices not only determined you don’t have the right to keep and bear arms, four Supreme Court justices signed their name to a declaration that Americans have no fundamental right to self-defense. That sounds like a stoned hippie. That doesn’t sound like a Supreme Court anything. It sounds like a supremely intellectually vacuous punk. To think that a human could think that humans don't have a basic right to self-defense is so bizarre to me — as to — my brain can't accept the information. And if you want more of those kinds of evil, anti-American people on the Supreme Court, then don't get involved, and let Obama take office again. 
Is the ""Motor City Madman"" correct about Supreme Court jurisprudence?

District of Columbia vs. Heller

We reached out to Nugent’s press contact and the NRA, but didn’t get a response. Still, we found a case with dissenting opinions signed by four justices that appears to be what he's referring to. (If Nugent offers us some other ""declaration,"" we’ll be happy to update our item.)

A quick refresher on the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: It says: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""

The 2008 case District of Columbia vs. Heller struck down the District of Columbia’s handgun-ownership ban. It also marked the first time the Supreme Court said the Second Amendment secures an individual right to gun ownership. But the decision was split 5-4 — and justices who didn’t side with the majority offered two dissenting opinions.

The dissents offered two views about self-defense.

Justice John Paul Stevens wrote, ""There is no indication that the Framers of the Amendment intended to enshrine the common-law right of self-defense in the Constitution.""

So, Stevens acknowledged a ""common-law right,"" but not necessarily a constitutional right.

Justice Stephen Breyer wrote: 
""Thus I here assume that one objective (but, as the majority concedes ... not the primary objective) of those who wrote the Second Amendment was to help assure citizens that they would have arms available for purposes of self-defense. ... 
""I shall, as I said, assume with the majority that the Amendment, in addition to furthering a militia-related purpose, also furthers an interest in possessing guns for purposes of self-defense, at least to some degree. ... Although I adopt for present purposes the majority's position that the Second Amendment embodies a general concern about self- defense, I shall not assume that the Amendment contains a specific untouchable right to keep guns in the house to shoot burglars. … 
""(T)he self-defense interest in maintaining loaded handguns in the home to shoot intruders is not the primary interest, but at most a subsidiary interest, that the Second Amendment seeks to serve."" 

So, Breyer acknowledges that one objective of the Second Amendment -- but not the primary objective -- is to allow citizens guns for self-defense, along with ""a general concern about self-defense,"" and ""a subsidiary interest"" in keeping loaded handguns at home.

Stevens and Breyer, along with Justice David Souter and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined both dissenting opinions.   
That's four justices. But we should note that Stevens and Souter are no longer on the court, replaced in recent years by Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. Nugent's phrase, ""We've got four Supreme Court justices who ..."" suggests he meant four current justices. Still, Sotomayor sided with the minority in a 2010 case, McDonald vs. Chicago, which affirmed the decision in District of Columbia vs. Heller, and Kagan hasn't yet tipped her hand. 
About the opinions themselves: We contacted a few attorneys who have argued before the Supreme Court to help us weigh whether those they could reasonably be described as ""a declaration that Americans have no fundamental right to self-defense.""

‘Fundamental right’

It turns out ""fundamental right"" has a fairly specific meaning in constitutional law. Justices divide constitutional rights into categories, such as fundamental and nonfundamental.

Fundamental rights, as you might have guessed, trigger a higher level of protection from the court. Laws that might infringe on such rights face ""strict scrutiny."" But regulations that infringe on nonfundamental rights have a much easier burden to pass constitutional muster. They just have to have ""a rational basis.""

Clark Neily, an attorney who helped represent security guard Dick Anthony Heller in District of Columbia vs. Heller, says it looks to him like the dissenting judges treated self-defense more like the court typically treats nonfundamental rights than fundamental rights.

In other words, Nugent's characterization was reasonably accurate.

Tom Goldstein, the publisher of SCOTUSblog who has argued 25 cases before the Supreme Court, agrees.

""I think Ted is correctly describing what the dissenters … believe,"" he said.

But Erwin Chemerinsky, the founding dean of University of California at Irvine School of Law, whose most recent book was The Conservative Assault on the Constitution, found Nugent’s statement misleading.

""The statement from Justice Stevens was about whether the Second Amendment right to bear arms includes a right to have firearms in the home,"" he said. ""The justices did not deny that self-defense is available as a defense in criminal cases in all 50 states. The Nugent statement made it seem that the justices were questioning that.""

In other words, Nugent’s use of the legal phrase ""fundamental right"" might make lay people think those justices disagree with self-defense as protection in criminal cases.

We’re willing to give Nugent credit for using the correct term of art, in this case ""fundamental right."" Still, we’ll ding him for saying the justices signed their name to a ""declaration,"" when he meant dissenting opinions in a court case — especially since they didn’t make it explicitly clear that self-defense was a nonfundamental right. Even Neily found that a stretch.

Our ruling

Nugent, an NRA board member for almost 20 years, told a crowd that, ""We’ve got four Supreme Court justices who … signed their name to a declaration that Americans have no fundamental right to self-defense.""  We find the phrase ""a declaration"" an exaggeration, along with the suggestion that all four justices are still on the court. But he’s correct that four justices signed on to dissenting opinions in District of Columbia vs. Heller that find some right to self-defense — but arguably not a fundamental right earning the Supreme Court’s highest level of protection. He used the right phrase. Still, ""a declaration"" and ""four justices"" make the statement just partially accurate.

John Wisniewski claims some New Jersey commuters pay more in tolls than state income taxes
","
Hudson River tolls are not a drop in the bucket. Crossing the waterway sets motorists paying cash back $12.

For some New Jerseyans, commuting to work in New York costs more than they pay in New Jersey income taxes, according to Assemblyman John Wisniewski, a Democrat from Middlesex County.

""There's one statistic that says if you're earning under $100,000 a year and you commute to New York every day you pay more to the Port Authority in tolls than you pay to the state of New Jersey in income tax,"" Wisniewski, the chairman of the state Democratic Party, said in a YouTube video posted on April 13. ""That's outrageous and that's got to be changed.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found Wisniewski’s statement is accurate because people who earn all of their income from wages in New York won’t pay New Jersey income taxes.

Wisniewski said his statement refers to a married couple with children. When the assemblyman’s office initially calculated the statistic it was based on a couple who earned $80,000 a year and had two children and one partner commuted to work in New York, using E-ZPass and taking two weeks of vacation, according to Tim O’Donovan, Wisniewski’s communication director.

But a broad group of commuters pay more tolls than New Jersey income taxes.

New Jersey residents who work in New York file tax returns with both states. New Jersey provides a credit that varies depending on income to residents for taxes paid to New York.

Any resident who only has income from wages in New York ""will always get a full credit,"" said Neil Becourtney, a certified public accountant and tax partner at J.H. Cohn LLP’s Roseland office. ""They will end up with no New Jersey income tax.""

Ron West, professor of taxation and law at Fairleigh Dickinson University, noted that if income is earned in New Jersey and New York, there ""could be a situation where the credit will not fully offset the New Jersey tax and there would be something owed.""

Still, even if residents owe nothing to New Jersey, West said, ""they’re paying tax, but New Jersey is not getting their hands on it.""  Instead, New York is.

For example, a married couple who earns $100,000 combined would owe New York more than $5,000 in income taxes, factoring in personal exemptions but no other deductions. Had that income been earned in New Jersey, the couple would owe roughly $2,600.

The credit offsets the couple’s New Jersey taxes. So, they owe nothing to their home state, but they still pay New York taxes.

O’Donovan said Wisniewski’s office also looked at what residents would owe New Jersey without the credit.

By that measure, a married couple with a taxable income of less than $94,950 would pay more in tolls than taxes if one partner commuted every weekday using E-ZPass. The same applies for an individual with a taxable income of less than $71,750.

Driving to New York five days a week, 52 weeks a year, would cost an E-ZPass user $2,470 in tolls annually. Cash users would pay $3,120. Annual toll costs drop about $100 with two weeks’ vacation taken.

Our ruling

""If you're earning under $100,000 a year and you commute to New York every day you pay more to the Port Authority in tolls than you pay to the state of New Jersey in income tax,"" Wisniewski said.

If New Jersey residents earn all their income from wages in New York, they would owe New Jersey nothing because a credit offsets their tax liability.

They’d still pay income taxes to New York, but Wisniewski specifically said taxes paid to New Jersey.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Michael Adams']","
PolitiFact: Calling HOPE 'richest' program goes too far
","
The HOPE scholarship program may be shrinking, but the financial aid it gives Georgia’s best students is second to none, the head of this state’s flagship university said recently.

Legislators cut HOPE in 2011 to rein in spending that was growing faster than the state could afford. The scholarship, which helps pay for in-state college tuition, began providing less money to all but the highest-performing students in August.

Adams thinks HOPE needs a long-term fix, but it’s still generous, he said in an April 15 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

HOPE is ""still the richest scholarship program in America,"" Adams said.

Still? Despite all of the changes?

HOPE now pays full tuition for only about 10  percent of recipients. The rest receive scholarships that cover 90 percent of tuition at 2010-11 academic year rates. That percentage will shrink over time. Tuition rose this school year and will climb again in August.

A University of Georgia spokeswoman said that Adams based his statement on data from the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs, which PolitiFact used to assess a March 2011 statement by Gov. Nathan Deal:

""Georgia still has one of the richest programs in terms of scholarships for students to go to college,"" Deal said then.  

We rated his claim True. Georgia was near or at the top, depending on what measure you considered.

For the past four decades, NASSGAP has kept track of how much money each state awards in postsecondary education scholarships and grants.

When Deal made his statement, the most recent data available covered the 2008-09 school year. Back then, Georgia awarded nearly $567 million in total grant aid. We ranked fourth in the nation behind California, New York and Florida, according to the association.

Divide that total by the number of students enrolled in undergraduate programs, and Georgia was second only to South Carolina.

Georgia’s HOPE program was also the largest of its kind. NASSGAP classifies HOPE as a ""non-needs-based"" scholarship, which means it awards money on factors aside from a student’s financial need.

Georgia awarded some $565 million in non-needs-based money, NASSGAP reported. This amount included funds for other non-needs-based scholarships, but HOPE spending accounted for a vast majority of it.

Florida, which ranked second, gave out about $100 million less.

But that was three years ago. Is HOPE ""still"" the richest scholarship in America, as Adams said?  

It’s tough to say with certainty.

NASSGAP numbers have been updated, but its latest data dates from about two years ago. It does not reflect the HOPE cuts passed in the spring session of 2011.

However, this data does hint at how HOPE currently compares to other programs.  

Georgia awarded about $672 million in non-needs-based scholarships such as HOPE during the 2009-2010 academic year.

Once again, Florida came in second. But the gap between it and Georgia grew to nearly $250 million. Tennessee, South Carolina and Louisiana round out the top five with amounts between $135 million and $262 million.

Georgia came in second on a per-capita basis as well.

Other states give away larger pots of money, but not many of them.

Nationally, about three-quarters of state grants are awarded based on financial need, said Frank Ballmann, a NASSGAP official.

California gave away more than $1 billion in needs-based financial aid in the 2009-2010 school year. New York placed second at about $900 million.

Still, Georgia’s program dwarfed almost all other state efforts that year. Pennsylvania, which was third place in needs-based aid, gave away about $413 million in needs-based aid.    

Now, let’s take a look at HOPE awards after the cuts.

Totals for 2011-2012 are not yet available. The Georgia Student Finance Commission, which administers HOPE and other state scholarship and aid programs, is still giving out money, a commission official said.

But projected amounts are available. After HOPE was cut, the Finance Commission’s budget was trimmed to reflect the changes. This updated budget allocates some $590 million for the HOPE grant, GED and scholarship programs.

At this funding level, Georgia’s ranking may fall this school year. NASSGAP’s data shows that over the past 10 years, states have doubled the amount of money they give out, not cut it.

But the numbers also suggest that HOPE will remain one of the nation’s most generous programs.

This $590 million budget would have qualified HOPE for a slot somewhere in NASSGAP’s top five two years ago, all other things being equal.

For Georgia to drop out of the top 10 this year, total grant aid awarded by lower-ranked states would have to grow by hundreds of millions of dollars. That’s unlikely in these austere times.

Adams’ assertion that HOPE is ""still the richest scholarship program in America"" needs some context. Georgia’s program was the richest of its kind two school years ago, and it ranked high in other measures, although this state’s pot of money wasn’t the biggest overall.

HOPE is likely to remain near the top this school year. Even with the cuts, other states are probably too far behind to catch up, for now.

Dan Scandling, Wolf’s spokesman, said his boss was referring to a June 2011 report from the CBO detailing the agency’s latest long-term outlook on the nation’s fiscal fitness.

Tables in the report contain projections showing that by 2025, payments for Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare and debt interest will exceed all federal revenues going into the budget. That’s a shade different from Wolf’s statement that there won’t be any money at all to pay for additional programs since, beyond using tax revenues, the U.S. also has been known to borrow money to finance its budget.

That technical distinction caught the eye of budget analysts we spoke to. But it doesn’t detract from Wolf’s gist that the CBO report shows the growing costs of entitlement programs and debt payments are eating up the government’s resources.  

The CBO’s scenario of exhausted revenues was based on the assumption that major U.S. policies in effect in June 2011 will continue indefinitely, such as extending the Bush tax cuts and preserving Medicare reimbursement levels to physicians.

The CBO also laid out a second, more optimistic outlook that assumed laws on the books in June 2011 will take effect.  That means that the Bush tax cuts would actually expire at the end of this year and Medicare payments to physicians would fall sharply in 2013.  

Under that scenario, revenues through 2085 would always stay above the costs of entitlement programs and interest payments on the national debt.

So Wolf is focusing on the bleakest CBO outlook. Is that fair?

Jim Horney, a vice-president at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said Wolf is not alone in citing the dark scenario. Although current laws call for ending all the Bush tax cuts and lowering Medicare reimbursements, Horney said it will be politically difficult for Congress to carry out these actions.

Wolf’s statement is similar to the conclusion reached in 2010 by a bipartisan commission appointed by President Barack Obama to recommend ways reduce the national debt.

""By 2025 (federal) revenue will be able to finance only interest payments, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security,"" the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform stated in its final report.  ""Every other federal government activity -- from national defense and homeland security to transportation and energy -- will have to be paid for with borrowed money.""

Two analysts told us the gloomy forecast offers the most realistic map of the financial road ahead.

Jason Peuquet, research director at the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said his organization has run its own numbers and concluded that entitlement and debt interest will outpace revenues in 2026.

Josh Gordon, policy director at the centrist Concord Coalition,a group that urges deficit reduction, pointed to a March 2012 report from the General Accounting Office that shows at some point between 2020 and 2030, the amount of spending on entitlements and interest will outpace all federal revenues going into the budget under the more pessimistic scenario.

""The real key is the revenues are still pretty low,"" Gordon said. ""The lower the revenue, the easier it is for spending programs to be larger than it.""

Our ruling

Wolf said the CBO projects that by 2025, every penny of the federal budget will go to interest on the debt as well as spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.  

The CBO report he cites says entitlements programs and debt interest will consume all the revenues going into the budget that year. Wolf’s language is a bit inexact, but we don’t think it detracts from his clear point: the U.S. is on a dangerous fiscal path.

Rob Portman says Buffett Rule would raise just enough to cover 1 week's interest on national debt
","
The U.S. Senate voted on the eve of Tax Day to reject the so-called ""Buffett Rule"" ensuring a minimum tax rate for millionaires and billionaires, but that didn't put the matter to rest. Democrats, who pushed the legislation, and Republicans, who blocked it, both believe that continued debate about taxes works to their advantage.

That debate includes the Paying a Fair Share Act, which was named the Buffett Rule for billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has said he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. The bill would impose a 30 percent minimum tax on those whose individual adjusted gross income exceeds $1 million a year.

Democrats say the legislation is about fairness and shared sacrifice to reduce the budget deficit.

Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, a director of the Office of Management and Budget under President George W. Bush, highlighted Republican criticism in a commentary for Politico on the day of the Senate vote.

He called the Buffett Rule a political gimmick and a distraction from real tax reform with little impact of consequence.

""For all the political chest-thumping surrounding this proposal,"" he said of the the Buffett Rule, ""the new tax will bring in less than $5 billion per year. That represents 0.4 percent of annual individual income taxes paid — or enough to pay one week’s interest on the national debt.""

PolitiFact Ohio had seen similar dismissals of the proposal, including the claim that it ""raises virtually no money,"" but Portman's statement was weightier and more detailed. We asked his office how he backed it up. Press secretary Christine Mangi ran through the proof:

On March 20, 2012, Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation -- a nonpartisan body that estimates tax changes for lawmakers -- released a score of the Buffett Rule projecting $46.7 billion in additional revenue over 10 years, or $4.7 billion per year on average.

Individual income tax receipts in 2011 totaled $1.09 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and $4.7 billion is 0.4 percent of that.

The March 2012 CBO baseline of net interest spending in fiscal 2012 is $224 billion, which comes to $4.3 billion per week.

The annual revenue of the Buffett Rule -- $4.7 billion -- would pay that one week’s interest.

We followed the steps, checked the sources and confirmed the accuracy of Portman's figures.

We also found that there is more worth knowing.

In projecting future revenue from the Buffett Rule, the Joint Committee on Taxation followed its standard practice of using a ""current law"" estimate, which assumes that temporary tax cuts or increases take effect as planned under current law.

Under the current law baseline, the so-called Bush tax cuts, which were extended in 2010, would expire at the end of this year. That scenario that would result in hundreds of billions in additional revenue from taxpayers, and the $47 billion would be on top of that.

A ""current policy"" estimate, on the other hand, refers to what the revenue numbers would look like if the current rules continued -- if Congress again extends the Bush tax cuts, as it is generally expected to do.

The current policy estimate says that if the Bush tax cuts are extended, then the Buffet rule would raise $160 billion over 10 years, or $16 billion a year. That's more than three times as much revenue as the current law estimate.

In relative terms, it is still a small fraction of the amount needed to achieve deficit reduction.

""On the other hand,"" Washington Post policy columnist Ezra Klein observed, ""any deficit-reduction package is made up of lots and lots of smaller policies that contribute to the bottom-line figure"" -- noting that a proposal last year to defund public broadcasting for budget   reasons ""packed about one one-hundredth the deficit reduction of the Buffett Rule.""

Finally, in framing the value of the Buffett Rule, we note that there is a difference between deficit and debt. The deficit is the amount by which the government's spending exceeds its revenues  in a year. The budget deficit for fiscal 2012 is more than $1.3 trillion.

The debt -- the figure used by Portman -- sets a much higher bar. It is the sum of yearly deficits and is the total amount that the U.S. government owes. The current total debt figure is $15.6 trillion.

Portman’s statement on the amount the Buffett Rule would raise and how that compares to interest on the national debt is accurate.

On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C162200>],/factchecks/2012/apr/23/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-buffett-rule-would-raise-just-eno/
