Obama's immigration heckler wrong on presidential powers, experts say
","Even a presidential heckler can find his way to PolitiFact’s Truth-O-Meter. At a speech Monday in San Francisco, a young man yelled at President Barack Obama and urged the president to overhaul the nation’s immigration system. ""Mr. Obama, my family has been separated for 19 months now!"" the man said, according to a New York Times report. (You can watch a video of the incident here.) Obama continued trying to speak, but the man continued yelling, saying at one point: ""You have a power to stop deportation for all undocumented immigrants in this country."" The heckler was later identified as Ju Hong, 24, of South Korea. The president replied, ""Actually, I don’t. And that’s why we’re here."" In this standoff, the president is largely correct. We covered much of this ground in a fact-check of Florida U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who claimed that Obama could ""basically"" legalize all immigrants here illegally ""by the sign of a pen."" We’ll review the evidence here. In the heckler’s case, he appears to be talking about Obama issuing an executive order to stop deportations. But experts said action like that would likely violate the separation of powers. Congress determines the laws governing how a person can legally reside in the country, so Obama cannot give out green cards, paths to citizenship or permanent residency en masse, experts told us. And Obama does not have the authority to override laws simply by proclamation. ""Executive orders have tended to be quite focused, not open-ended over time,"" said Kevin Johnson, University of California Davis School of Law dean. ""Such an order would likely be subject to quite possibly successful legal challenge, with the claim being that legalization would be contrary to an act of Congress, namely the Immigration and Nationality Act."" Now, Obama has taken some executive action. In June 2012, amid stalled DREAM Act efforts, Obama announced a new administrative policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals that allowed undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children to apply for a renewable, temporary status that suspends deportation and allows them to work in the country. So far, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has approved at least 455,000 people for this form of deferred action. Obama, however, has said he does not plan to go further. And experts say making the case would be difficult. If he wanted to order a stay of deportations across the board, he would have to provide a strong justification, such as a lack of resources to do the job, said Robert Delahunty, a University of St. Thomas School of Law professor who co-authored an argument against the constitutionality of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. ""But he could do that only briefly, and only in what I’d consider pretty extreme circumstances,"" Delahunty said. On the other hand, the country’s immigration laws grant Obama and the Department of Homeland Security lots of wiggle room in granting temporary work permits and refusing to widely deport people, said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. A widespread stay, though, would be ""a crazy scenario,"" he said. Even some of Obama’s loudest critics on immigration policy don’t think he would go that far. ""It could be done. Obama’s gotten away with as much, but I don’t think he’d do it,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that is for stricter immigration control. ""That would be a bridge too far even for the pusillanimous appeasers among Republicans in Congress."" Experts told us they think it’s more conceivable that Obama would chip away at the undocumented immigrant population little by little by building on the deferred action policy for children who came to the country as minors. An expansion would have to come with caveats, such as cut-off dates and clean criminal histories. ""It would be the mother of all political battles,"" said Carl Hampe, a private immigration lawyer who was counsel for the Senate subcommittee on immigration from 1983 to 1991 and worked for the Department of Justice under President George H.W. Bush. ""As a purely theoretical legal question, is there a plausible argument that the president has that legal authority? Some would argue yes."" Our ruling While giving a speech in San Francisco, President Barack Obama was heckled and told he has the ""power to stop deportation for all undocumented immigrants in this country."" Our experts say any executive action that sweeping would violate the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. Obama has taken some executive action to temporarily keep more undocumented immigrants in the United States, and likely could do more, but not to the permanent point that the heckler argues.

Cobb businessman's claim on new Atlanta Braves stadium on target
","By Eric Stirgus The proposed new home of the Atlanta Braves is a large swath of heavily wooded land that could be a hit for Cobb County government and schools if the baseball team moves there, some supporters of the plan say. ""These 60 acres have produced zero SPLOST money for parks and recreation, have produced zero money for education,"" said John Loud, who owns Loud Security, based in Cobb. True? PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d do some digging. Loud, along with Superior Plumbing owner Jay Cunningham, have spearheaded an effort to rally public support in favor of the plan. The two men led a campaign for a 1 percent sales tax for education in Cobb County and the Marietta city school system that passed in March. Loud said he was referring to sales tax money from the land that has gone back to the county government or school system. ""There’s no sales tax that comes out of those acres,"" he said. The Braves have secured land within the Cumberland Community Improvement District, team officials say. The team plans to use 60 acres for the stadium and development, the Braves say. The Cumberland CID is an area approved to tax businesses within its borders. The land is located just north and west of I-75 and I-285. The team wants to build a 41,500-seat stadium, along with an amphitheater, stores and restaurants leading up to the ballpark. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has identified several parcels where it believes the Braves want to build the new stadium and other development. The Braves declined to identify the parcels that have been secured, citing a confidentiality agreement. The team did say it believes the land is undeveloped. A Cobb County government spokesman agreed. ""It’s all vacant land,"" said the spokesman, Robert Quigley. Cobb, like most metro Atlanta counties, collects a 1 percent special purpose local option sales tax on most items sold in local businesses to pay for the construction of new government buildings, roadways and equipment. Quigley said the county cannot collect SPLOST proceeds from vacant property. As for whether the property has produced zero money for education, that’s a more complicated element to Loud’s claim. Cobb collects about $140,000 a year in school taxes from the land, Quigley said. Our total, based on the parcels the AJC believes the Braves have secured, was close, at nearly $143,000. Loud was aware of how much money is collected in property taxes for the school system when PolitiFact Georgia gave him a call. He stressed he was talking about sales tax revenue in The Marietta Daily Journal article. ""There’s no commerce (there), so there’s no sales tax generated,"" said Loud, who believes the county will collect millions of dollars annually from the land if it is developed by the Braves. To sum up, Loud said the 60 acres the Atlanta Braves are considering as part of a stadium development have produced no SPLOST money for parks and recreation and zero money for education. The site’s owners currently pay property taxes that go to the county’s school system. Loud said he was referring to sales tax revenue from the land. His quote in the newspaper article could had been clearer about the point he was trying to make. There is some additional detail that must be understood for anyone who reads Loud’s quote.

Medical marijuana easy to get under proposed Florida law, sheriff says
","According to the latest poll, public support for legalizing medical marijuana in Florida is high (pun intended). If the language for the ballot initiative gets past the Florida Supreme Court, voters will have their say in November 2014, when they’re asked to approve an amendment to state Constitution. But the initiative as a whole still has its fair share of critics, including many law enforcement officials. Grady Judd, president of the Florida Sheriffs Association, wrote an editorial opposing the amendment in the Sun-Sentinel, criticizing the ballot measure as essentially marijuana legalization. ""Authors of the amendment have included a truck-sized loophole in the definition of debilitating diseases, which changes the word disease into ‘condition.’ And what constitutes a valid ‘condition?’ "" Judd wrote. ""Any condition where the ‘use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks’ of someone who claimed to be sick. This means people who alleged minor ailments such as muscle spasms, neck pain, back pain and even menstrual cramps have qualified for government-sanctioned pot-smoking."" PolitiFact Florida wanted to check out what conditions patients could get medical marijuana licenses for under the proposed Florida law. The amendment Let’s start by taking a look at the proposed medical marijuana amendment text. The ballot summary reads: ""Allows the medical use of marijuana for individuals with debilitating diseases as determined by a licensed Florida physician. Allows caregivers to assist patients’ medical use of marijuana. The Department of Health shall register and regulate centers that produce and distribute marijuana for medical purposes and shall issue identification cards to patients and caregivers. Applies only to Florida law. Does not authorize violations of federal law or any non-medical use, possession or production of marijuana."" So when a doctor prescribes cannabis, the Department of Health will issue the patient a license. Under Florida law, patients would not be able to grow their own plants. Approved patients could purchase marijuana from registered, state-regulated centers. The amendment says how the centers will operate with regard to registration, record-keeping and safety would be determined by the department after passage. Because medical marijuana would be legally dispensed, the program is government approved. However, saying it’s ""government-sanctioned"" isn’t quite right, because government officials are not encouraging marijuana use, as the definition of the word ""sanction"" would imply. In the amendment text itself, which goes beyond the ballot summary, we get a list of qualifying diseases: And here’s the part that Judd referred to: ""or other conditions for which a physician believes that the medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient."" That means it’s up to doctors to determine if patients could benefit from using medical marijuana. Judd draws a comparison between what the proposed amendment in Florida would allow and what patients in other states have experienced. Out of the 20 states (plus the District of Columbia) that have legalized medical marijuana, only California and Massachusetts have requirements similar to Florida’s proposal that allow for physician discretion when it comes to qualifying conditions. Most other states have a finite list of conditions, but say that the health department could add more or assign waivers. So Florida’s amendment would have a more relaxed standard than most states. When we reached out to Judd, his spokesman told us that it’s clear medical marijuana access would not be limited to what he referred to as ""debilitating"" illnesses. Other critics of medical marijuana have pointed out that any system, even in states with stricter rules, is not immune to loopholes and abuse. For example, an Arizona TV station reported that 90 percent of cardholders in the state claimed chronic pain. However, the biggest age group claiming chronic pain was 18- to 30-year-olds, even though chronic pain is more common in older adults. So we can understand why Judd’s editorial speculates about the possibility that some healthy individuals will try to acquire licenses. Experts say So we know Florida has a flexible definition of which conditions qualify a patient for medical marijuana, which supports Judd’s point. But should the conditions he lists really be considered ""minor ailments""? University of California, San Francisco doctor Donald Abrams has studied the effects of cannabis on cancer and HIV patients. Based on his experience treating and studying chronic illnesses, he said the conditions Judd listed are often serious. ""Some of these things that your sheriff considers to be trivial require people to take opiates,"" Abrams said, adding that these medications (such as morphine) are less safe than marijuana. Several experts pointed out that muscle spasms are a common symptom of multiple sclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease that would already be greenlighted for medical marijuana treatment if the Florida amendment passes. Neck pain, back pain and menstrual cramps are also frequently treated with prescription pain medication. Today chronic pain affects about 100 million U.S. adults, according to the American Academy of Pain Medicine. Oh, and as for menstrual cramps, ladies? Abrams said Queen Victoria opted for a little marijuana therapy to relieve her pain in the 19th century. So yes, Judd is right that someone with one of these ailments would be eligible for a medical marijuana license at a physician’s discretion. But it’s a misleading generalization to describe these conditions as ""minor."" Our ruling Judd said that people with ""minor ailments"" could get access to marijuana if Florida’s proposed amendment passes next year. He mentioned spasms and other chronic pain as a minor condition, when sometimes those conditions are quite serious. But compared to most other states, Florida’s ballot language is flexible because it allows for physicians to determine whether a patient’s condition qualifies for a license.

"['Immigration', 'Oregon', 'Causa Oregon']","
Do more than 70 percent of American voters support a ""pathway to citizenship"" for undocumented immigrants?
","Few issues are more likely to ignite roaring political arguments these days than immigration. Finding common ground on this hot-button topic isn’t easy, as witnessed now in Washington, D.C., where Congress could adjourn for the year without reaching agreement on immigration reform that members of both parties insist is critical. But while some say the real focus should be on increased border security and not rewarding those who enter the country illegally, others counter that guest-worker programs and the needs of the estimated 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally should be paramount. In this atmosphere of division, a recent claim by Andrea Miller, executive director of Causa Oregon, caught our attention. In a Nov. 14, 2013, news release criticizing House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, for his refusal to take up an immigration bill passed by the Senate, she said, ""American voters remain steadfast in their support for immigration reform with a path to citizenship, with more than 70 percent who want to see reform passed this year."" Given the controversy hanging over every aspect of immigration, are more than seven in 10 Americans really in favor of reforms that include providing ""a path to citizenship?"" PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We emailed Causa Oregon, a Salem-based immigration rights organization, and asked where it got the 70 percent figure. Erik Sorenson, the group’s communications director, said that ""several polls"" contain that finding. He specifically mentioned a recent Gallup poll. We checked and found some information supporting Miller’s assertion. In a Gallup poll conducted in June 2012, for instance, 66 percent of respondents said immigration is ""a good thing"" for the country. That was up up from 59 percent last year and one percentage point off the high of 67 percent in 2006, according to the poll. The response was even more favorable in a Gallup poll conducted in June. Fully 87 percent of respondents said they favored allowing ""illegal immigrants living in the U.S. the opportunity to become citizens after a long waiting period if they paid taxes and a penalty, pass a criminal background check, and learn English."" As Sorenson indicated, a number of other polls around the country have revealed strong support when respondents were asked if they support reform that would allow immigrants living in the U.S. illegally to remain here legally and, further, to apply for citizenship. An Associated Press GfK poll conducted in January, for instance, found that more than six in 10 Americans favored allowing illegal immigrants to eventually become U.S. citizens. A CBS News poll last month showed 77 percent of respondents willing to embrace that option. Miller’s claim was looking plausible but we called the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, D.C., to get another perspective. Steven A. Camarota, the nonpartisan group’s research director, said, in essence, not so fast. ""It all depends on what you ask,"" he said. ""As with all polls, how you phrase the questions matters enormously."" Camarota said he was familiar with the poll results Causa Oregon cited, but he passed along a couple of other recent polls that produced dramatically different results. The primary difference from one to another, he said, was the wording. An Ipsos poll conducted in February for Thompson Reuters, for instance, asked bluntly, ""When you think about immigration, which of the following solutions comes closest to your opinion?"" Only 5 percent of respondents answered yes to ""All illegal immigrants should be able to stay in the U.S., with some exceptions."" Another 31 percent said ""most"" should be able to remain here. However, a combined 53 percent said most or all illegal immigrants should be deported. Camarota said similar reversals in results came when pollsters subbed in the word ""amnesty"" for the phrase ""pathway to citizenship."" Yet another poll, conducted in August by NBC News/Esquire, asked respondents if they supported ""providing illegal immigrants with a path to citizenship even though they have broken the rules."" Only 16 percent answered yes. ""If you remind people that illegal immigrants broke the rules,"" Camarota said, ""they pull back quickly. It suggests the support may be tissue-paper thin."" All of the polls we looked at, including those mentioned by Causa Oregon, were conducted by reputable, professional polling organizations and had error margins no greater than plus or minus three percentage points. The combined results of those polls, not unlike the controversy surrounding proposed immigration reform, were all over the map. So do seven in 10 Americans support letting illegal immigrants remain in the U.S. with an added bonus of a pathway to citizenship? Apparently so, according to several polls -- but only if you don’t remind respondents that someone ""broke the rules"" coming here in the first place. Adding that phrase, according to other polls, yielded a far different answer.

Macy’s, other retailers asked Rick Perry to veto equal-pay measure
","A reader forwarded an email to us in which state Rep. Senfronia Thompson urged a boycott of Macy’s department stores on the day after Thanksgiving 2013. ""The fact that Macy's doesn't support equal pay for women should stop you from shopping there on Black Friday,"" the Houston Democrat wrote, saying that her equal-pay proposal cleared the Legislature earlier this year, but ""then Macy's sent a letter to Rick Perry urging him to veto the law, which he ultimately did."" Thompson’s House Bill 950 was among 24 bills Perry vetoed June 14, 2013. It would have created state law similar to 2009’s federal Lilly Ledbetter Act, which gave plaintiffs more time to sue over pay discrimination in federal courts. An Aug. 6, 2013, news story in the Houston Chronicle reported that Texas Retailers Association members including Macy’s and Kroger’s had written Perry in May asking him to kill the legislation because, they said, it would lead to open-ended litigation and duplicate federal law. Thompson spokeswoman Milda Mora told us by phone that the representative learned of the letters from the Houston Chronicle reporter in August and checked with the governor’s office, which provided her with copies that Mora emailed to us. One written on Macy’s letterhead (click here or scroll down to view it) concluded, ""The federal requirements under Lilly Ledbetter are unnecessary and would be harmful to Texas employers. We urge you to veto this legislation."" Macy’s spokeswoman Bethany Charlton confirmed that her company sent the May 31, 2013, letter, which was signed by a company vice president. By email, Charlton said the company ""absolutely supports equal pay for equal work among men and women"" but believes existing laws ""provide strong remedies"" for discrimination. Perry’s logic was similar: ""House Bill 950 duplicates federal law, which already allows employees who feel they have been discriminated against through compensation to file a claim with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,"" said his June 14, 2013, veto statement. Progress Texas, the pro-Democratic organization that distributed Thompson’s email and is organizing the boycott, disputes Perry’s statement that the bill would have duplicated federal law, saying that the Ledbetter protections need to be codified in state law for them to apply to cases in state courts. The group’s executive director, Ed Espinoza, told us by email that his group launched a boycott of Macy’s and other retailers when the news broke in August. An Aug. 7, 2013, Chronicle news blog post said Thompson took part in that boycott also, canceling a planned appearance at a Macy’s store to mark the state’s annual sales-tax holiday.

Cuccinelli says Warner cast ""the tiebreaking vote"" on Obamacare
","Republican Ken Cuccinelli’s narrow loss in the Nov. 5 gubernatorial election has spurred talk about whether he’ll challenge U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat who’s up for reelection next year. In a Nov. 18 article in The Washington Post, Cuccinelli said he found the idea of running against Warner ""tempting,"" particularly given the troubled rollout of the Affordable Care Act,  which Warner helped pass in the Senate.   ""You were the tiebreaking vote,"" Cuccinelli said of Warner and his support for the ACA, also known as Obamacare. We wondered whether Warner really did cast the tiebreaking ballot that allowed Obamacare to survive. Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for Cuccinelli, told us Warner provided the critical vote in 2009 that prevented a Senate filibuster on the ACA. ""(Sixty) votes were needed to avoid a filibuster and allow the legislation to pass, so there was not one vote to spare"" Gottstein wrote in an e-mail. ""Mark Warner provided that vote."" Gottstein was referring to the Senate’s cloture rule that requires 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to end debate on most types of legislation and allow an up or down vote on the bill. On Dec. 23, 2009, the Senate voted 60-39 to halt debate on Obamacare. Warner joined all of his fellow Democrats and two independents in voting to stop a threatened Republican filibuster. The next day, the Senate passed Obamacare with an identical 60-39 vote. But Warner’s vote wasn’t as important this time because only a simple majority was required to approve the legislation. So let’s return to the filibuster-breaking roll call. No doubt, Warner’s vote was crucial to ending debate, as were ballots of 59 other senators. But does that mean that Warner was ""the tiebreaking vote,"" as Cuccinelli says? It turns out that Republicans and conservative groups across the country have accused a lot of the Democratic senators of casting the key vote that unchained Obamacare. PolitiFact national noted in June 2012 the 60 Plus Association ran an ad claiming Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., cast  ""the deciding vote"" that passed the law. In Ohio’s senate race last year, Republican Josh Mandel said Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown cast ""the deciding vote."" In Michigan, Pennsylvania and Missouri, conservatives charged that Democratic Sens. Debbie Stabenow, Bob Casey and Claire McCaskill, respectively, were each  ""the deciding vote."" And let’s not forget New Hampshire, where GOP candidate Jim Rubens said earlier this month that Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen was ""the deciding vote"" to pass Obamacare. That’s six ""deciding votes"" even before Warner was added to the list. Warner’s vote was hardly a mystery in late 2009 as the Senate neared the 60-vote majority to end debate. The Virginia Democrat, in a floor speech that Sept. 23, urged Congress to move forward on health care reforms. The Los Angeles Times, in a Dec. 24, 2009 article, said the final two holdouts to join the super majority were Sens. Joseph Lieberman, I-Conn., and Ben Nelson, D-Neb. Our ruling Cuccinelli said Warner provided ""the tiebreaking vote"" that allowed Obamacare to become reality. There’s a sliver of truth here in that Warner did indeed provide a crucial vote that helped Democrats get to the 60 votes needed to advance the Affordable Care Act. But it’s misleading to say he cast ""the vote"" when Warner was joined by 59 other senators who, by Cuccinelli’s rationale, also would have cast the tie-breaking vote. Warner was not among the last holdouts that boosted the Senate to a super majority; he made his intentions known three months before the vote.

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says most young Republicans think poorly of climate change deniers
","Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) has now made 50 speeches on the floor of the U.S. Senate urging his colleagues and other Americans to ""wake up"" about the issue of climate change. He has railed against global warming skeptics, many of them Republicans who say that the planet is not warming or, if it is, the warming isn't caused by human activity. During his Nov. 13 speech, he argued that ""the polls show clearly that climate denial is a losing tactic"" and young people aren't fooled by the arguments of climate change ""deniers."" We've fact-checked two other Whitehouse statements from his previous speeches about climate issues. We ruled his claim that the oceans ""have become 30 percent more acidic"" Mostly True; his assertion that Narragansett Bay waters have gotten 4 degrees warmer in the winter since the 1960s earned a Half True. In his Nov. 13 speech, one of the poll numbers he cited caught our eye. ""Fifty three percent of young Republican voters -- Republican voters under age 35 -- said that they would describe a climate [change] denier as 'ignorant,' 'out of touch' or 'crazy,'"" Whitehouse said. ""Republicans outside of Congress are trying to lead their party back to reality and away from what even young Republicans are calling ignorant, out of touch or crazy extremist views."" Do more than half of young-adult Republicans really think climate change skeptics are loopy? Whitehouse’s office said he got the figure from a survey commissioned by the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental advocacy group. The league hired two firms -- GS Strategy Group (which does Republican polling) and Benensen Strategy Group (President Obama's chief pollster) -- to conduct a joint poll of 600 registered voters, ages 18 to 34, last July. Fifty-three percent of Republicans under 35 said they would ""describe a politician who says climate change is not really happening"" as out of touch, ignorant or crazy, according to a joint July 24, 2013 memo from the polling firms. (The rest, if they had an opinion, preferred characterizations such as ""independent,"" ""commonsense"" or ""thoughtful,"" which were the three positive options offered.) When Democrats and independents were added in, the ratio of people who considered deniers to be out of touch, ignorant or crazy jumped to 73 percent, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent. ""It is not surprising then that a climate change denier faces stiff headwinds with young voters, with 68% saying they would be less likely to vote for a climate change denier,"" according to the report. ""And even among Republicans, 47% would be less likely to vote for a denier."" It should be noted that only 7 percent of all respondents -- Republicans, Democrats and  independents -- characterized deniers as ""crazy."" We asked the League for a Republicans-only breakdown in that category because we suspect that very few would put skeptics in the crazy category. Spokesman Jeff Gohringer said the League would not release any further data. ""The purpose of the poll was to show that Republicans understand climate change is happening and they want to see action,"" he said. ""The disconnect in Washington is that this is somehow a party issue, that the Democrats support it and Republicans don't. But huge swaths of both parties support action on climate and they know it's a problem."" One important caveat should be noted. The poll asked respondents to classify people who argue that climate change is not really happening. But that's only the most extreme type of climate change ""denier,"" a word never used in the survey. Other people sometimes saddled with that label acknowledge that the climate is changing, but they argue that it's due to natural variability, not human activity. So the League poll only characterized the deniers with the most extreme -- and scientifically untenable -- position. That's an important distinction, which can be seen in the Pew Research Center's recent national survey on climate change, conducted Oct. 9-13, among 1,504 adults. A hefty 46 percent of all Republicans said there is solid evidence that Earth is warming. But the percentage drops to half that amount (23 percent) when Republicans were asked if the warming is mostly due to human activity. Nineteen percent of the GOP respondents said it's due to natural patterns. Our ruling Sheldon Whitehouse said, ""53 percent of young Republican voters . . . under age 35 said that they would describe a climate [change] denier as 'ignorant,' 'out of touch' or 'crazy.'"" He cited the number accurately. But the findings come from just one poll, commissioned by a conservation group. And the question he referenced focused only on the most extreme position of climate change ""deniers"" (those who believe that the climate is not changing). That term can also include people who acknowledge that climate change is occurring but don't believe it’s caused by humans. Whitehouse is making a leap by suggesting that the League survey is a gauge of how all ""deniers"" are regarded by younger Republicans. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

"['Health Care', 'PunditFact', 'Sarah Palin']","
Sarah Palin says fewer people will be covered by 'sensible' doctor-patient relationship
","Any time former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin weighs in on the health care debate, our ears perk up as fact-checkers. The 2008 vice presidential candidate brought us ""death panels"" (our 2009 Lie of the Year) and helped circulate the inaccurate statement that the Affordable Care Act is government-run health care. On Fox News Sunday, Palin continued her criticism of the law and expressed skepticism that ""30 million more people will receive health care coverage under Obamacare."" Palin then made a bold statement regarding the health care law and the doctor-patient relationship. ""There will be fewer people being covered under a sensible doctor-patient-relationship-centered health care program under Obamacare than what we see today,"" she said. ""I guarantee you that."" That sounds like other statements PolitiFact has checked in the past. We decided to investigate. Government, health care and you We reached out to Palin’s camp in hopes she could clarify her statement, particularly what she meant by a ""sensible doctor-patient-relationship-centered health care,"" but she didn’t get back to us. It sounds like previous claims made by the law's opponents, namely that Obamacare puts the government between Americans and their doctors. In the past, PolitiFact said that assertion was False. The health care law overwhelmingly relies on the private sector to provide coverage to the millions of Americans currently without health care by offering subsidies to help people obtain private insurance. There is an expansion of Medicaid, but reliance on that joint federal-state program has shrunk as several Republican governors have chosen not to increase their Medicaid rolls. Obamacare primarily sets guidelines for minimum coverage of care and created marketplaces for plans to be bought and sold to the uninsured. As PolitiFact noted when former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said last year that ""Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor,"" if that were the case, we would expect doctors to be up in arms. Instead, the American Medical Association, the largest doctor advocacy group in the country, has been supportive of the law. There are other instances when the federal government seeks to improve overall quality of care through bureaucratic means. In 2020, for example, a 15-member panel called called the Independent Payment Advisory Board can recommend changes in reimbursement rates and other cost-saving measures for Medicare. Some have said this will lead to rationing, but we have repeatedly found those concerns exaggerated. Recent reports Now, there are recent reports that insurance companies are shrinking their networks, including excluding certain hospitals from coverage. This is particularly the case for insurance plans sold on the new state and federal marketplaces created by Obamacare. In certain instances, as noted by the Washington Post, it has meant some families forced to change doctors or purchase more expansive, and expensive, plans outside the government-run insurance marketplaces. The limitations are happening in attempts to keep costs down. One insurance company, Anthem, told the Post ""the network still covers 74 percent of all primary-care providers and 78 percent of specialists,"" and the smaller networks would drive down the cost of their plans. Some of this maneuvering was going on for years, and a trend already taking place in the industry may have just been accelerated by the law. In the spring of 2011, the Los Angeles Times reported that insurance companies in California offered a narrower list of providers to thousands of customers. So there is some volatility in the market, and that will continue to be the case as doctors, patients, insurance companies and regulators adjust to changes in the law and the massive amount of new customers now buying insurance. Our ruling  Palin said the health care law changes ""a sensible doctor-patient-relationship-centered health care program."" It's valid to be worried about people potentially seeing changes in their coverage, including some people who will be forced to switch doctors. But that’s a far cry from Palin’s actual words, which suggest some sort of government intervention in the doctor-patient relationship. That's not the case. We rate Palin’s statement False.",/factchecks/2013/nov/24/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-says-fewer-people-will-be-covered-sens/
"['PunditFact', 'Matthew Dowd']","
Matthew Dowd says Barack Obama, Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell flip-flopped on 'nuclear option'
","Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the ""nuclear option,"" meaning the Senate can now approve President Barack Obama’s executive and judicial nominations (except for the Supreme Court) with a simple 51-vote majority. Previously, appointments could be blocked by a filibuster, which would require 60 votes to break. On This Week, ABC political analyst Matthew Dowd criticized politicians on both sides of the aisle for changing their viewpoints on the nuclear option. ""There's a virus going around Washington, D.C., and it's a virus of hypocrisy,"" said Dowd, a former adviser to President George W. Bush. ""Harry Reid was against this before he was for it. Mitch McConnell was for it before he was against it. President Obama was against it before he was for it."" PunditFact won’t make a judgment call about whether politicians’ changes in opinion are justified. We’ll just review if and how their stances have changed, which we’ve already analyzed on PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter for Obama, Reid and McConnell. Let’s go back in time to see if Dowd’s correct. Take 2005: Bush was starting his second term with a Republican majority in the Senate. Democrats filibustered a host of Bush’s nominees, so the Republicans considered invoking the nuclear option. Obama (then a freshman senator), McConnell and Reid were all involved in the filibuster debate. Sounds familiar. How did their 2005 positions compare to what they’ve said and done in 2013? Obama In 2005, Obama was in the Senate minority. Here’s what he had to say on the Senate floor that April about approving nominations with a simple majority: ""The American people want less partisanship in this town, but everyone in this chamber knows that if the majority chooses to end the filibuster, if they choose to change the rules and put an end to democratic debate, then the fighting, the bitterness, and the gridlock will only get worse."" He’s changed his tune now that he’s in Bush’s shoes. ""I support the step a majority of senators today took to change the way that Washington is doing business -- more specifically, the way the Senate does business,"" Obama said on Nov. 21. ""What a majority of senators determined by Senate rule is that they would restore the longstanding tradition of considering judicial and public service nominations on a more routine basis."" Reid In 2005, Reid was the minority leader. On the Senate floor that May, he spoke against the nuclear option, the very same procedural change he invoked as the majority leader seven years later. ""You should not be able to come in here and change willy-nilly a rule of the Senate,"" he said, addressing Bush. He then referred to the nuclear option as ""foolishness."" But in 2013, with a president from his own party trying to approve nominees, Reid invoked that very option. ""Gridlock has consequences and they're terrible,"" he said to the Senate. ""It's not only bad for President Obama, bad for this body, the United States Senate, it's bad for our country."" McConnell We’ve established that Democratic leaders have changed their stances, but what about the Republican leadership? McConnell, now the Senate minority leader, was the majority whip in 2005. Back then, he spoke in favor of stopping the filibusters. ""The majority in the Senate is prepared to restore the Senate’s traditions and precedents to ensure that regardless of party, any president’s judicial nominees, after full and fair debate, receive a simple up-or-down vote on the Senate floor,"" he said on the Senate floor in May 2005. Fast forward to 2013, and McConnell’s criticizing the Democrats for trying to ""break the rules to change the rules."" ""Let me say we are not interested in having a gun put to our head any longer,"" he said. Our ruling Dowd accused leaders like Obama, Reid and McConnell of changing their stances on the Senate’s nuclear option. In 2005, when there was a Republican president and Senate majority, McConnell and others advocated for (but never invoked) an end to filibustering nominees. Now, when a Democratic president and Senate majority have invoked the same change, McConnell opposed it. Meanwhile, Democrats like Obama and Reid supported the same change they fiercely attacked during the Bush administration.

Democratic challenger to Scott Walker says state budget has grown $4.6 billion during his tenure
","From Madison to Tomah, from Janesville to Milwaukee, as Mary Burke has introduced herself to Wisconsin voters, she tells them about her concern over how much Gov. Scott Walker has increased the state budget. Wait -- don’t Democrats usually rip the Republican governor for his budget cuts? In a Madison interview on Nov. 5, 2013, Burke was asked how she would provide tax relief to the middle class if she is elected governor in 2014. ""Well, I think we have to make sure that we are living within the means of our taxpayers and I know people are struggling,"" the Madison school board member and former Trek Bicycle Corp. executive said on WMTV-TV (Channel 15). ""So, we need to balance the state budget, we need to make sure the money that we're spending is utilized well. I'm concerned that the state budget has actually grown by $4.6 billion under this administration, which makes it harder and harder to keep taxes lower."" You would think Burke’s figure, which she repeated in a Madison speech on Nov. 20, 2013, could be checked with a simple comparison of two numbers. But you’d be like the guy who proposes to his girlfriend while slipping a ring on her right hand: Well-intentioned, but a little misguided. Burke’s numbers  Burke’s phrasing could be taken to mean she was claiming the two-year state budget has grown $4.6 billion since Walker succeeded Democrat Jim Doyle in January 2011. Or that it has grown by that amount at some point during Walker's tenure. Initially, even Burke's own campaign wasn't clear on what she meant. When we asked spokesman Joe Zepecki for evidence to back Burke’s claim, he compared the size of Walker’s first budget, for 2011-’13, to Walker’s second budget, for 2013-’15. He provided a PolitiFact Wisconsin article, which made reference to the first budget being $66 billion; and a reference by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, which said the second budget ""authorizes the state to spend"" $70.4 billion. But the two figures are apples and oranges: the $66 billion figure for 2011-’13 was for the general fund budget -- operations funded with state revenue; the $70.4 billion for 2013-’15 is an ""all funds"" figure that includes federal funding as well as $2 billion in borrowing. Zepecki then said his staff had made a mistake and that Burke’s statement actually compared Walker's current budget to Doyle's final budget. Zepecki cited figures from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau showing an increase of $4.6 billion, from $65.8 billion in 2009-’11 to $70.4 billion in 2013-’15. But both of those figures are ""all funds"" appropriations -- not the general fund budget, which comes from state tax dollars and typically is the focus of lawmakers, the news media and others when talking about the state budget. So, let’s review some other numbers. Other numbers We put Burke’s claim to Robert Lang, director of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state agency in charge of scoring budgets and other money matters. Lang said that looking strictly at biennial general fund budgets -- the ones funded with state revenue -- Doyle’s final spending plan for 2009-’11 was $62.19 billion and Walker’s current budget, for 2013-’15, is $67.5 billion. That’s an increase of $5.31 billion. Lang also said that whenever his agency is asked to compare biennial spending, it considers not only the budget itself, but any other legislation that becomes law during the two-year period. For example, a $100 million property tax relief law approved under Walker after the 2013-’15 budget was adopted would be tallied. Using that method, Doyle’s final spend was $62.95 billion and Walker’s spend in the current biennium -- as of Nov. 15, 2013 -- is $67.62 billion. An increase of $4.67 billion. So, by the two official figures, Burke’s number claim is on target, or even conservative. But what about the rest of her statement, that Walker is responsible for the growth in the budget? Perspective The growth in Walker’s first budget was driven largely by increased expenditures on Medicaid; in his second budget, the increases were in large part for Medicaid and school aids. Walker's press secretary, Tom Evenson, contended the increase since Walker took office is $4.4 billion -- slightly less than Burke’s $4.6 billion claim -- but said it is misleading to say Walker decided to increase spending by that amount. ""These are commitments the state cannot easily back out of and stem from decisions largely made prior to Gov. Walker taking office,"" Evenson said of the federal- and state-funded Medicaid program. Medicaid costs are driven by many factors, from how many people are eligible for the program to the cost of treatment and what recipients are asked to contribute in co-pays. That's much different than a governor simply deciding to boost spending on various programs. Indeed, the highlights of Walker’s first budget included a nearly $800 million cut from public schools, tax cuts for investors and businesses, and clamp-down on property taxes. His second budget included a $651 million income tax decrease, a two-year university tuition for freeze and an increase in property taxes on the typical home limited to 1% in each of the two years. Our rating Burke said the state budget ""has actually grown by $4.6 billion under"" Walker’s administration, suggesting Walker had boosted the spending.   The figure is accurate, but it is due almost completely to Medicaid costs, not budget decisions Walker made. For a statement that is partially accurate but takes things out of context, we give Burke a Half True.",/factchecks/2013/nov/24/mary-burke/democratic-challenger-gov-scott-walker-says-state-/

Talk show host John DePetro says Providence was a “sanctuary city” under Mayor David Cicilline
","Though it isn’t generating the political heat it did five years ago, immigration is still a hot-button talk radio issue. It resurfaced Oct. 21, 2013,  when WPRO talk show host John DePetro was interviewing Brett Smiley, who plans to run for mayor of Providence. DePetro asked Smiley what he’d do as mayor about the number of ""illegal aliens"" in the city, and then said that ""under Mayor [David] Cicilline, it [Providence] was a sanctuary city. He and the chief at the time, Dean Esserman, they wouldn’t cooperate with ICE regarding illegals in the city."" The sanctuary city charge has been aimed at Cicilline, now a U.S. representative, before. Brendan Doherty, Cicilline’s Republican opponent in the 2012 congressional election, claimed during that campaign that Cicilline ""espoused"" Providence as a sanctuary city.  We found no evidence that Cicilline ever took that position and ruled Doherty’s claim False. We wondered whether DePetro’s phrasing was more on the mark. DePetro said he based his statement on what he views as Providence’s begrudging-at-best cooperation with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.   He said a prime example of that was the handling of a 2008 rape by Marco Riz, a Guatemalan man who was in the country illegally. Riz, who kidnapped a woman in Warwick and assaulted her in Providence’s Roger Williams Park, is serving a 30-year sentence. The Providence police had picked Riz up on a misdemeanor charge months before the rape and released him, even though he had previously been ordered deported by an immigration judge. In news accounts at the time, the Providence police and ICE each found reason to blame the other for the mistake. Providence police said they’d checked a national warrant database and found no warrants for Riz. They said they’d faxed a copy of his arraignment form to ICE and the agency never responded. ICE officials said Providence police should have contacted the agency’s Vermont office to check Riz’s status, and if they had, they’d have found about about the deportation order. (Now, instead of faxing reports, Providence police electronically transmit arrested suspects’ fingerprints to the attorney general’s office, which automatically adds them to national databases that ICE monitors, said Providence police spokeswoman Lindsay Lague and  attorney general spokeswoman Amy Kempe .) So what about DePetro’s claim? The phrase ""sanctuary city"" gets tossed around a lot when immigration policy is being discussed, but even experts have a hard time defining it. During a congressional hearing in 2007, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff observed, ""you know, people use the term sanctuary city in different ways, so I’m never quite sure what people mean."" Some have applied the term to cities such as New Haven, Conn., where the city issues its own identity cards regardless of immigration status, cards that can be used to get city services or open bank accounts. Or Takoma Park, Md., where residents who are not citizens of the United States have been allowed to vote in local elections since 1993. Or San Francisco, where the city and county have ordinances that specifically forbid city employees from helping ICE unless ordered to by federal or state law or a warrant. Or Cook County, Ill., where the county commissioners voted not to honor ICE requests to hold prisoners unless ICE was willing to pay for their incarceration. It also ordered that, absent a criminal warrant, county law enforcement personnel were not to expend time responding to ICE inquiries. Providence had none of those measures under Mayor Cicilline, nor does it now. In 2007, then-City Councilman Miguel Luna proposed an ordinance that would have specifically declared Providence a ""sanctuary city."" It never made it out of the Ordinance Committee for a vote. While Cicilline was mayor, however, the city resisted then-Gov. Donald Carcieri’s efforts to enlist municipalities in immigration enforcement. But Providence continued to notify federal ICE officials when it arrested suspected illegal immigrants and was never cited for failure to cooperate by the federal government. Our ruling John DePetro said that under Mayor David Cicilline, Providence ""was a sanctuary city."" While there is no legal definition of ""sanctuary city,"" in the eight years that Cicilline was mayor Providence had not taken any of the measures adopted by other cities often identified by that label. We rule DePetro’s statement False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

This means that both sides in this recent faceoff made different arguments than they had in previous iterations of the battle.

Hochberg says only one third of Texas college students graduate
","
Texas’ high school graduation rate has become a serious talking point in this election cycle, but there are other students we should fret about too, says Rep. Scott Hochberg, D-Houston.  
""We do have a serious problem in this state,"" he said to a June 25 caucus at the Texas Democratic convention. ""We have many. But one of them is when our kids graduate from high school, the proportion that go to college is small. And more seriously, even those who go, only about a third of them are getting through."" 
Two out of three Texas students who go to college don’t graduate? We wondered. 
As back-up, Hochberg forwarded us data he received from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which oversees the state’s public colleges and universities. The board tracked students who were in seventh grade in 1997-98 and therefore could have graduated from college by 2009.  
Results? Some 32 percent of the 168,739 students who entered a Texas college after high school had graduated within a six-year period with a bachelor’s degree, an associate degree or certificate (in real estate or law enforcement, for example). 
A couple of caveats: First, the data don’t account for students who enrolled in a Texas institution and then transferred out of state. Second, while the enrollment data include the 6 percent of students who attended school out of state, it doesn’t track whether they graduated.  
A one-time shot of grant money did allow the board to track how many Texans enrolled in 7th grade in 1994-95 had earned college degrees both in and out of state within a six-year period by 2006. It found that of 8,028 high school graduates enrolled in school out of state, almost 50 percent earned a degree or certificate. However, of 134,473 students enrolled in Texas, 36.5 percent graduated. Combined, about 37 percent of the tracked graduates earned a degree or certificate.  
Andy Kesling, the board’s communications director, said Hochberg is correct that only about one-third of those students graduated from a Texas college.  
But, he said, it ""all depends on how you look at the data. One thing I’m really concerned about is people go away with the impression that only one third of the students going to school in Texas are graduating. If you look at the six-year graduation rate of Texas universities, the graduation rate is 57 percent."" 
That means that of the students who entered a four-year public university in Texas in the fall of 2002, 57 percent graduated within six years, by September 2009. That includes students who transferred to another public or private school in Texas.  
Hochberg quibbles with that graduation rate because it excludes the many students who attend institutions like community colleges. ""It’s not apples to apples,"" he said. ""It’s only the best apples."" 
Of some 300,000 Texas students who were enrolled in 7th grade in 1997-98, about 63,800 later enrolled in a four-year school, like the University of Texas, while 90,800 enrolled in a two-year school, like Austin Community College. That is, about 60 percent of students pursuing post-secondary education go the community college route. 
Their graduation rate is far lower. Of the students enrolled full time at a community college in the fall of 2002, the board found that only 11 percent graduated within three years, by 2005. 
The coordinating board isn’t alone in tracking college graduation rates.  
Using U.S. Census Bureau data, the Chronicle of Higher Education, a Washington-based journal, reported in April that 30.7 percent of Texas 25- to 34-year-olds had college degrees, compared to 38 percent nationally. 
Then there’s the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems, which found that as of 2008, 49 percent of first-time full-time Texas students seeking a bachelor’s degree graduated within six years, ranking the state 35th nationally. Looking at the percentage of first-time full-time students seeking their associate degrees, the center found Texas fared worse: 18.6 percent, ranking 41st in the country. Looking at the raw numbers, we found that 35.2 percent of students seeking an associate or bachelor’s degree graduated.  
Where does this leave Hochberg’s statement?  
As we learned in earlier checking candidate claims about high-school graduation rates, there are several ways to sort the numbers. The state’s six-year graduation rate at universities, for example, is far higher than the rate Hochberg cites. Yet rolling students seeking associate degrees into the equation supports Hochberg’s assessment. About a third of Texas students lately graduate from a Texas college.

Democratic Rep. Gutierrez says 40 percent of illegal immigrants overstay visas
","On the July 11, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill. -- a champion of immigration legislation that includes a path to citizenship -- faced off with Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., a leading lawmaker who favors prioritizing immigration enforcement.

At one point, Gutierrez said, ""Here's the problem, and here's the fact that Mr. Bilbray leaves out of this debate. The fact is that 40 percent of the undocumented workers in this country didn't cross that border. They came here legally to the United States. They came on a tourist visa. They came on a student visa. They came on a temporary worker visa, and they overstayed their visa.""

We thought that statistic was worth a fact-check.

Quantifying the number and nature of illegal immigrants is tricky -- precisely because they are evading law enforcement. But we located estimates made by the Pew Hispanic Center which the experts we interviewed consider credible.

In a 2006 report, the center estimated that ""nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials."" Specifically, the estimate ranged from 38 percent to 50 percent. The report split the difference by proposing a figure of 45 percent.

So based on this measure, Gutierrez is accurate. In fact, he's being cautious, sticking to the low end of the spectrum.

However, we'll offer two caveats.

First, the data in this report, in addition to being an estimate, is several years old, so it's possible that the figures have changed.

Second, the data for overstaying visas varies quite a bit between nationalities.

The Pew report noted that only 16 percent of Mexican illegal immigrants who arrived prior to 1996 were in violation because they overstayed their visa. The comparable number for Central American immigrants was 27 percent, while the percentage for immigrants from the rest of the world was 91 percent.

Granted, these statistics are even older than the ones cited above. However, the underlying reason for the disparity has not changed: Compared to other nationalities, it is still ""easier for Mexicans to make illegal entries and harder for them to get visitor visas,"" as the report put it.

A big reason, said Judith Gans, an immigration specialist at the University of Arizona, is that burden of proof is on visa-seekers to demonstrate to U.S. consular officials overseas that they won't be overstaying their visa, through such indicators as having a large family, a job and significant assets in their native country. As a result, she said, ""Mexican middle-class people can get temporary visas such as tourist visas fairly easily. The same holds for middle-class Central and South Americans. Mexican poor people generally can’t obtain visas, nor can poor Central and South Americans.""

So one can argue that Gutierrez's decision to use the 40 percent figure in a televised discussion that focused on the U.S.-Mexico border is somewhat misleading, since viewers could be led to conclude -- incorrectly -- that 40 percent of Mexican or Latin American immigrants were simply overstaying their visa.

But when we contacted Gutierrez's staff, they said that the distinctions across nationalities highlight exactly the point they were trying to make -- that politicians and the media are putting a disproportionate focus on U.S.-Mexico border crossings when in fact the illegal immigrant population, and the issues that follow, are much more diverse.

""The opponents of immigration reform would like to keep the immigration issue focused on Latin America, the U.S.-Mexico border, and those who enter the U.S. without inspection, but that is only part of the story,"" said Gutierrez spokesman Douglas G. Rivlin. ""The congressman's point when using this statistic was that the problem is bigger than the U.S.-Mexico border, bigger than Latin America, Latinos, or Arizona and therefore requires a more comprehensive, federal, national solution.""

In fact, Gutierrez made precisely that point on the show. Immediately after the quote we checked, he said, ""So what we do is we continue to focus on the border as if that were the exclusive problem that we have with our immigration system and those staying here.""

Rivlin added that Gutierrez is sponsoring a bill (H.R. 4321) that would, among other things, establish an entry-and-exit system to track who enters on a temporary visa and whether they leave when they are supposed to.

Reasonable people can disagree over whether Gutierrez is justified in arguing that the U.S.-Mexico border shouldn't be the focus of policymakers' attention on immigration. But the fact that he raised this issue when mentioning the visa-overstay statistics mitigates the potential for confusion. When that is weighed against the uncertainties over the age of the data and the need to use estimates rather than hard statistics, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/12/luis-gutierrez/democratic-rep-gutierrez-says-40-percent-illegal-i/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Elections', 'Ethics', 'Texas', 'Bill White']","
White, citing available schedule, says Perry is, per hour, the highest-paid state worker
","
Bill White, the Democratic nominee for governor, said last month that GOP Gov. Rick Perry lazes about. 
Hold that thought: White told reporters in Austin June 17 that “if you divide the hours (Perry) works in by the amount he’s paid, then he’s by far and away the highest-paid state employee on an hourly basis.” 
UPDATE, July 13, 2010: After we published this article, an Austin reader pointed out that the equation White spelled out wouldn't generate a dollars-per-hour estimate at all. Dividing hours worked by dollars paid, as White suggests, leads to a figure for the number of hours worked for every dollar paid. In this case, that's  a very small number. Over all, this detail doesn't affect the substance of this article or our rating of White's statement. Still, we wish we'd caught this twist in the first place. 
White’s campaign cited Perry’s public schedule for January through May and its calculation that Perry accumulated 145.5 hours of scheduled events in the period. White spokeswoman Katy Bacon said in an e-mail: “We followed (Perry’s) state schedule and counted 1 hour for events, 1/2 hour for phone calls, 1/2 hour for press conferences. Most busy CEOs get in and out and get things done. Church was not counted.” 
Bacon added that she’s heard Mack Brown, head coach of the University of Texas football team, is the highest-paid state employee, “but you can bet he works a lot more than seven hours a week.”
 
We’re not testing Brown’s work ethic, but we’re game for White’s charge, which his campaign based on dividing five months’ of Perry’s $150,000 annual salary—about $62,500—by 146 (rounding up from 145.5 hours of state-scheduled events as listed on his schedule), resulting in an “hourly” pay rate of about $428. 
Made sense for Bacon to mention the UT coach, who’s widely known for having the top salary among state workers, at $5.1 million. Presuming a 40-hour work week, Brown’s hourly rate breaks out to nearly $2,452. Presuming a 60-hour week--head football coaches work notoriously long hours--Brown’s hourly rate drops to nearly $1,635. If Brown improbably worked around the clock, his hourly rate would be $582, still more than the hourly rate White calculates for Perry. 
Another UT coach and the head football coaches at Texas A&M University and Texas Tech University each make $1.5 million or more, as noted in a 2010 chart compiled by the online Texas Tribune listing the highest-paid state workers. Assuming each works 60 hours a week, their salaries translate to hourly rates of $481 or more. 
Then again, the argument is often made that college coaches like Brown, whose salary derives from sports revenues, are in a special category. What about other state employees? 
Separately, we asked the state comptroller’s office to break out the state’s highest-paid workers, including Perry. The agency, citing salary figures as of April, generated a list taking into account about 157,000 state workers, excluding college and university employees, which it does not track. 
The compilation suggests Perry’s annual salary is less than what the state pays 313 other workers, topped by Britt Harris, chief investment officer of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, at $480,000. We called the system and inquired into how many hours Harris works. Spokesman Howard Goldman said “well over 40” hours a week. Assuming Harris works an average of 60 hours weekly, his hourly rate runs about $154. If he’s averaging 50 hours a week, the rate would be about $185. 
Perry’s hourly wage is more than double those amounts, per White’s calculation of his working hours based on events posted on his official schedule. This begs the question: Is the schedule an accurate indicator of how much time Perry spends on the job? 
That’s a toughie because the schedule is far from complete, making it hard for anyone to gauge how the governor spends his time. In 2008, the Austin American-Statesman reviewed the calendars for the state’s top six statewide elected officials covering January through March of that year. The newspaper said that while the officials’ calendars “did not prove to be comprehensive accountings of their working hours, they yielded glimpses of how the officials spent their time.” 
Perry had state-related events on fewer than 40 days during the period, the newspaper reported, counting a parade, a coach's salute and two Washington dinners--and he had no state-scheduled events on 31 weekdays.  
A Perry spokesman at the time, Robert Black, was quoted noting that Perry had just assumed the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association and started promoting his book saluting the Boy Scouts. “Both these events took up a considerable amount of the governor's time,” Black said, “but working hard to elect more conservative governors across the nation and espousing the values and virtues of the Boy Scouts of America is well worth the effort.”  
Of late, Bacon told us in an e-mail, it’s up to Perry to prove he’s been busy with state business in the many hours he did not have scheduled events. She said: “When you're a CEO, you can't have last-minute meetings. Things have to be planned in advance.” 
We didn’t hear back from Perry’s campaign or his state office. But we came across this reaction to the White campaign calculation from Perry, as reported by Hearst Newspapers columnist Peggy Fikac: “If they've made anybody that can outwork me yet, please introduce me to him or her. Texans know I am mobile, I am agile, and I'm going to continue doing work for 'em 24/7. Just because it doesn't show up on my schedule doesn't mean I'm not out working for the people of the state of Texas, thank you very much."" 
Bacon spotted the same Perry reaction, which she termed “truly priceless” in an e-mail. “He is ‘mobile’ and ‘agile?’ What does that have to do with working seven hours a week while drawing a full-time salary? Sounds more like something related to jogging ... and shooting coyotes,” wrote Bacon -- a reference to Perry’s declaration this year that he shot a coyote while jogging. 
Seeking historical perspective, we called chiefs of staff to the governors preceding Perry, George W. Bush and Ann Richards. 
Joe M. Allbaugh, who was Gov. Bush’s chief of staff,  said Bush’s official schedule didn’t reflect his work days, which often ran from early in the morning into evenings, especially if lawmakers were in session. “This is foolish and hogwash for the White campaign to draw this type of comparison,” Allbaugh said. “All public officials put in more hours than they’re paid. It doesn’t matter if you’re Democratic, Republican or Martian, your public service is not for the money.” 
We asked Allbaugh, who backs Perry’s re-election, if it’s possible Perry enjoys a lot of down time. Allbaugh replied: “I don’t know if it’s possible to do that or not. People need to remember, that person is governor full time... Hurricanes, oil spills, they don’t call up (from) 8 to 5 (saying:) ‘By the way, is the governor in?’” 
Next, we reached Austin lobbyist John Fainter, who was a chief of staff for Richards when she was governor and earlier served as secretary of state with Gov. Mark White. Fainter, who has contributed to Perry's campaign kitty, said governors don’t ever get away from work. “Things come up,” Fainter said. “The schedule is largely irrelevant as to the time they actually spend on duties.” 
We get it: Texas governors don’t punch time clocks.  
Where does that leave White’s statement that Perry is “far and away” the highest-paid state worker on an hourly basis? 
For starters, Perry’s hourly wage as calculated by White is less than what we calculated for several state employees (coaches).  
Most importantly, he assumes the public schedule released by Perry’s office accounts for all his working hours. But according to the Statesman’s previous reporting as well as two veterans of the governor’s office, such schedules are woefully incomplete. 
White could have sought a better accounting of how the governor spends his time without cobbling together comparisons that don’t hold up.

"['Georgia', 'Ethics', 'Karen Handel']","
Gubernatorial hopeful Karen Handel said rival John Oxendine ""illegally funneled"" money
","
A glossy eight-page mailer sent by Republican gubernatorial hopeful Karen Handel casts her as above the allegations of backroom dealings and ethics violations of her primary rivals.

""Karen Handel has fought corruption, while the good ole boys are politics as usual,"" her mailer states.

With the help of unflattering photographs and excerpts from newspaper articles, the mailer aired the dirty laundry of her three biggest primary opponents. One was the race's behemoth: state Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine.

With his deep campaign coffers, name recognition and high polling numbers, Oxendine has long been considered the campaign front-runner.

Handel's mailer hits Oxendine right where it hurts: his ethics.

""John Oxendine is under a state ethics investigation because he illegally funneled more than $120,000 to his campaign from shady insurance political action committees in Alabama,"" it said.

Oxendine's run-in with the State Ethics Commission is renown. The commission has been mulling the legality of those campaign contributions ever since The Atlanta Journal-Constitution broke the story in May 2009. Since then, Republicans have said that should Oxendine win the July 20 primary, the party may lose its grip on the governor's seat.

But is it correct to call what Oxendine did ""illegal""?

Oxendine's troubles began with 10 campaign contributions made in late 2008. The $120,000, which is about 10 times what state rules allow, was given by 10 Alabama political action committees set up by Donald V. Watkins, a director of State Mutual Insurance.

Oxendine regulates State Mutual and its subsidiary Admiral Life Insurance Co. of America. Both headed by Delos ""Dee"" Yancey III, a prominent businessmen who is one of Oxendine's friends.

The problem is that Georgia's Ethics-in-Government Act prohibits officials from taking money directly from companies that they regulate. It also bans using multiple PACs to skirt contribution limits of $12,200 per candidate in an election cycle.

Oxendine returned the money and maintains he did not violate the law. His campaign declined to comment.

The accusations are real, but whether they are true is far from settled, said Tom Plank, the commission's legal counsel.

Typically, the commission holds a preliminary hearing where members vote on whether there are ""reasonable grounds"" to think the accused violated the Ethics-in-Government Act, Plank said. If there are, an administrative judge hears the case and issues a written ruling.

If there's reason to believe the violation was willful, the case can be booted to criminal court. The defendant is prosecuted on a misdemeanor charge, Plank said.

Proceedings for Oxendine's case are in their early stages. State Mutual filed suit in Superior Court of Fulton County accusing members of the commission of political bias. A judge barred the commission from holding a preliminary hearing scheduled for June 24, and it has since decided against holding a hearing before the July 20 primaries.

This means the commission has yet to decide whether the case against Oxendine has enough merit to go before a judge.

Still, the Handel campaign stands behind its statement.

""Just because he hasn't been convicted yet doesn't mean he didn't break the law,"" Handel campaign manager Dan McLagan said.

But it doesn't mean he broke the law, either.

The bulk of Handel's statement is accurate. Oxendine is under a state ethics investigation. It does concern $120,000 worth of questionable campaign contributions that came from Alabama PACs. Those PACs were set up by the director of two insurance companies regulated by Oxendine and headed by Yancey, one of his friends.

But stating as a fact that Oxendine ""illegally funneled"" money is incorrect. Handel's mailer said a violation took place even though the commission has yet to vote on whether the case has merit. No judge has been assigned to the case, much less issued a ruling.

If the mailer said Oxendine was ""accused"" of illegally funneling money it would have been correct. But it didn't. We rate Handel's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/12/karen-handel/gubernatorial-candidate-karen-handel-said-rival-jo/

Gemma says Democrat ranks are thinning as voters shed party ties
","Anthony Gemma, one of four Democrats running for the 1st Congressional District seat being vacated by Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, was vying for the party's endorsement on June 28 when he spoke about the percentage of registered Democrats and suggested that the party's share was declining.""What's at stake for the Democratic party in the upcoming election and beyond? Today 41 percent of Rhode Islanders are registered Democrats. Forty eight (percent) are unaffiliated. It is the common political wisdom that the trend away from the Democratic party to non-affiliation will continue and intensify. But I have the courage to be your congressman. I will lead the fight to reverse that trend, to reinvigorate [the] populism that has never left the heart of the Democratic party.""It certainly seems that more voters are unwilling to sign up with a party these days. But is the trend really there?So we checked with the secretary of state's office.The numbers provided to us by spokesman Chris Barnett seem to show that Gemma misspoke a bit. He should have said that 41 percent of registered voters are registered as Democrats. Not all Rhode Islanders are registered to vote. The actual percentage as of June 18: 40.9 percent of the 701,180 registered voters are declared Democrats. Unaffiliated voters make up 48.6 percent and Republicans have 10.4 percent. (The Moderate Party had 312 registered voters, or 0.044 percent.)But we were interested in the trend.Barnett supplied numbers going back to Sept. 12, 2006. Looking at those, it's hard to see where Democrats have been losing ground.On Sept. 9, 2008, Democrats essentially made up the same percentage of voters: 40.8 percent. The percentage of unaffiliated voters was also a bit lower than today, at 48.2 percent.Two years before that, on Sept. 12, 2006, 35.2 percent of the voters declared themselves as Democrats, a significantly lower ratio. The unaffiliated made up 54.5 percent of the voting population, higher than today.So, if anything, the popularity of the state Democratic party has grown since 2006 and the share of unaffiliated voters has declined.When we asked the Gemma campaign about the claim, spokesman Ray Rickman, who served as deputy secretary of state from 2001 to 2002, said Gemma's staff was harking back to an earlier era. ""Two or three of us have been around forever and we remember when 60 percent of everybody, or even higher, were Democrats and the number of unaffiliated was 12 percent, or whatever,"" he said.He said the campaign was unable to find earlier numbers, a problem Barnett in the secretary of state's office had also brought up. Until the last several years, ""they didn't collect it because it changes almost weekly,"" Rickman said. ""And people only wanted to know what the vote was, not what the registration was.""The only way to get such numbers would be to compile historical records from all 39 municipal canvassing boards, which would be cumbersome, he said.So we dug a little deeper, and found a Providence Journal story from March 7, 2000, reporting that then-Secretary of State (and now Congressman) James Langevin tracked the number of eligible voters going back to 1970. The story included a breakdown of the 2000 numbers by party. The data: fewer than 9 percent were Republicans, 56 percent were unaffiliated (far higher than today) and 35 percent were Democrats (significantly lower than today). Gemma is citing a trend that doesn't exist -- not in recent history, not going back 10 years.

McConnell proposed extending unemployment benefits using stimulus money
","
Haggling over extending unemployment insurance to the nation’s jobless ended in a deadlock last week when Senate Democrats couldn’t secure one additional vote to prevent a Republican filibuster.  
The next day, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas advised that Republicans are not against extending such benefits. They just want the benefits to be paid for first, he said, instead of adding the costs to the federal deficit. 
""Sen. (Mitch) McConnell offered a fully paid two-month extension of unemployment insurance,"" Cornyn told Texas reporters during a July 1 conference call. McConnell is the GOP leader in the Senate. 
Mindful the nation’s unemployment rate hasn’t slipped below 9 percent in more than a year — it was 9.5 percent in June — we decided to investigate.  
First, some background: Since it was created in 1935, the unemployment insurance system has helped the jobless by replacing part of their lost income for up to 26 weeks. Though supervised by the federal government, the program is run by the states, which provide most funding through employer taxes.  
In 1970, Congress created the permanent Extended Benefits program, which provides an additional 13 or 20 weeks to former employees who have exhausted their 26 weeks of regular benefits in states where unemployment has worsened. 
On top of that, Congress regularly extends unemployment benefits during serious economic downturns. Most recently, in June 2008, Congress created the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program so workers who had exhausted state unemployment benefits could receive up to 34 weeks of additional benefits — and workers in states with high unemployment rates qualified for or up to 53 weeks of additional aid. As of May 2010, Nevada had the highest unemployment rate in the country at 14 percent, followed by Michigan (13.6 percent) and California (12.4). Texas’ unemployment rate stayed steady from April at 8.3 percent, while North Dakota had the lowest rate: 3.6 percent. 
Experts we spoke with from across the political spectrum couldn’t recall an instance when extensions during recessions were funded up front.  
Why not? Gary Burtless, an economist at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution and formerly of the U.S. Department of Labor, said unemployment rates 7 percent or more are almost always considered emergencies — ""that is, serious recessions for which a major federal response is considered appropriate."" Emergency expenditures can add to the deficit because Congress can approve them without offsetting the costs with spending cuts or revenue increases. 
Congress and the sitting administration have approved unemployment benefit extensions in every recession since the late 1950s, Burtless said.  
The Senate majority leader, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said on the Senate floor June 30: ""We, as a Congress — Democrats and Republicans — have always extended unemployment benefits because it is an emergency. President Reagan did it for almost three years. President Bush did it for a couple of years. It has been going on on a bipartisan basis when times are tough in America."" 
Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert and resident scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told us that while such extensions temporarily contribute to deficits, they’re usually one-time expenditures, as opposed to spending that ""continues into perpetuity or creates a policy that adds to spending over the longer term."" 
""Generally speaking, when you hit a downturn, you want to have deficits that spur your economy,"" he said. ""But most states, of course, have balanced-budget amendments, so they provide a fiscal drag... the only place you can turn is the federal government."" 
Case in point: In February 2009, President Barack Obama signed the stimulus act, which extended through 2009 emergency unemployment insurance. 
Congress subsequently extended benefits in November, December, March and most recently in April, with an $18 billion bill extending benefits until June 2. Each time, the legislation wasn’t offset with tax revenue or spending cuts — a sticking point for most Republicans. In February, Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., initially refused to allow the Senate to consider a House measure to extend benefits for 30 days because it wasn’t offset with other savings. 
The deficit is on the rise. In its analysis of Obama’s budget for fiscal 2011, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted annual deficits would pile up, totaling $9.8 trillion by 2020.  
Which almost brings us back to now. From June 18 through June 30, Senate Democrats failed to secure enough votes to extend unemployment benefits while increasing the deficit. Reid ultimately fell a vote short of the 60 votes needed to block a filibuster on an amendment that would have extended unemployment benefits through Nov. 30, retroactive to June 2, the expiration date for the previously extended benefits. The Congressional Budget Office projected the blocked extension would cost $33.9 billion through 2020. 
Republicans said they would support extending benefits if they were paid for up front. And on June 30, McConnell, the minority leader, proposed a two-month extension — rather than the Democratic-backed extension through November — that he said reduced the deficit by $1.7 billion. How? By adjusting Medicaid payments, trimming stimulus-funded food stamps in 2014, cutting $600 million in stimulus-supported programs to expand broadband Internet access and eliminating a provision letting qualified residents receive their earned-income tax credit throughout the year instead at the end of the tax filing season.  
""We cannot support job-killing taxes and adding tens of billions to the already unsustainable national debt,"" McConnell said on the floor June 30. ""If the Democrats object to extending these programs using their own stimulus offset to pay for them, then they will be saying loudly and clearly that their commitment to deficit spending trumps their desire to help the unemployed."" 
Democrats rejected McConnell’s proposal, saying that the stimulus money would be needed elsewhere to boost job growth.  
Thomas Mann, a congressional scholar at Brookings, said that in the past, it was broadly accepted that additional spending on unemployment benefits during a serious economic downturn wasn’t harmful to the economy. Similarly, most of the funding during the last eight years for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was treated as emergency spending and not included in the regular budget, he said. In 2005, for example, Congress approved Bush’s request for $51.8 billion in emergency spending — $1.4 billion to the military, $400 million to the Army Corps of Engineers, and $50 billion to ""disaster relief’ (the legislation came in the wake of Hurricane Katrina). 
Summing up: Of late, congressional efforts to extend unemployment insurance benefits have failed — including McConnell's proposal to finance an extension by paying for it with stimulus funding. 
We rate Cornyn's statement as True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/11/john-cornyn/mcconnell-proposed-extending-unemployment-benefits/

Former Gov. Roy Barnes said Georgia passed laughable legislation
","Georgians, the rest of the country is laughing at you, former Gov. Roy Barnes says. And that means corporations are reluctant to relocate here and give you jobs.   It's because your state Legislature has done some wacky things, according to the Democrat's latest campaign commercial, ""Travel for Jobs."" In this bid to win his old job back, Barnes took us on a trip down memory lane to recall some of the Legislature's stranger moments.   ""[I]t's hard for industry to take us seriously when the Legislature attempts to outlaw stem cell research, passes bills about microchips in the brain and talks about seceding from the union,"" an announcer said in the ad.   Wait. Microchips? In the brain?   And secession? Recently?  The Barnes campaign sent us information on all three legislative attempts. All passed the Senate, then withered in the House.   On stem cell research:  The campaign cited 2009's Senate Bill 169, the Ethical Treatment of Human Embryos Act, sponsored by state Sen. Ralph Hudgens of Hull.  Typically, when people discuss the stem cell research controversy, they're talking about ""embryonic"" stem cell research, which can destroy the embryo. This poses ethical problems for people who regard a human embryo as a human life.   The legislation stated that the creation of all embryos ""shall be solely for the purposes of initiating a human pregnancy."" This means it would have barred scientists from creating human embryos for research.  The bill does not ban embryonic stem cell research involving already-existing stem cell lines or lines from out of state. This was by design, Hudgens told PolitiFact Georgia.   It passed the state Senate March 12, 2009.  So state legislators did try to ""outlaw"" an important element of embryonic stem cell research, but not all of it.   On microchips in the brain:   Barnes cited SB 235, the Microchip Consent Act of 2010, sponsored by state Sen. Chip Pearson, a Republican from Dawsonville. It would have made it a misdemeanor to require a person to be implanted with the device beneath or in the skin. This includes the brain.   Proponents had no evidence of large-scale abuses of the technology.   ""This is proactive,"" state Rep. Ed Setzler, who pushed the bill in the House, said at the time. It passed the Senate on Feb. 4.   Therefore, while the state Senate did not pass ""bills"" on ""microchips in the brain,"" it did pass one of them. And that one only cleared one chamber of the Legislature.  On seceding from the Union:  The Barnes camp pointed PolitiFact Georgia to Senate Resolution 632, which was also sponsored by Pearson. He could not be reached to clarify the bill's intent, so we analyzed the language ourselves and read an op-ed he wrote that was published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.   The six-page resolution does not specifically mention ""secession,"" but it does lay out how and when states would do it. If the federal government creates laws that states think overstep its constitutional authority, they can ""nullify"" those laws, or declare them void.   Here's where the possibility of secession comes into play. The bill lists six types of laws that, if enacted, would prompt the dissolution of the United States. Some, such as the declaration of martial law, are remote possibilities. Others are not, such as laws that limit the right to bear arms, ""including prohibitions of type or quantity of arms or ammunition.""  If such laws are passed, the federal government's powers would revert to the states, according to the resolution. States that want to form a new United States can do so. The rest can go off on their own.   The resolution passed the state Senate April 1, 2009.   In Pearson's op-ed, he disagreed with critics who said that the bill ""will likely lead Georgia to secede from and disband the United States."" It is an ""extreme view"" and ""loose interpretation of the measure's language.""   That may be true, but whether the bill makes secession ""likely"" is a separate issue. The bill opens the door to it. Or as Barnes' commercial said, it ""talks about seceding from the Union.""   We find that Barnes' ad is not entirely correct but does say many accurate things.   Georgia's state Senate did try to outlaw types of embryonic stem cell research, though not all of it, as the ad suggests. It passed a law -- not ""laws"" -- on ""microchips in the brain."" And while a bill didn't use the word ""secession,"" it raised the possibility and outlined what would trigger it.

This time it was Stephen Archambault, one of the three Democrats who have filed for Attorney General.At the June 28 Democratic state convention in the 17th-floor ballroom of the Providence Biltmore hotel, Archambault complained that Blue Cross, which enjoys non-profit status, spent excessively when it equipped its new Providence headquarters.

But we don't have first-hand knowledge and at this juncture cannot confirm it,"" said Horowitz. ""As a result, we will not be using it any more and it shouldn't have been included in the speech the other night. The broader point about the cost of the building we believe to be completely on target.""When we asked Blue Cross about the table, Kimberly Reingold, director of media relations and external affairs, said she was unable to find a granite table, not even in the board room, where the table is made of wood.So we went back to the Archambault campaign and asked Horowitz to contact the secret source and identify the room containing the swanky table.Then we called Blue Cross and asked for a tour of the new 13-story building that overlooks Waterplace Park. We were told by Reingold that customer service areas were off-limits because of federal patient confidentiality laws. We offered to wear earplugs so we couldn't overhear comments from the customer service representatives. We also offered to sign a confidentiality agreement vowing to keep any medical information secret. Reingold said neither offer was acceptable, although we could see other areas of the building.Our plan was to get the location of the table from the Archambault source and, if we weren't taken there on the tour, ask to see the room where it was purported to be.Horowitz, Archambault's spokesman, reported a few days later that the campaign's source was not returning phone calls.So we took the tour anyway. We were allowed to view a customer service area from afar and didn't see any furnishings that appeared lavish. We saw the gym, with new exercise equipment, along with a room for exercise classes (employees pay $16 a month to use the facility), but nothing out of the ordinary for a building with 1,100 employees.""There are no granite tables,"" insisted Thomas Bovis, assistant vice president of corporate real estate and administrative services, who coordinated the development of the building.At the end of the tour, we asked to see the board room to confirm Reingold's report. Reingold said it was off limits because we would have to pass areas where we might be able to see documents with customer information.She then agreed to take our camera to the board room and snap photos from two different angles. Based on those pictures, the table looks like it's made of wood.We give the Archambault campaign credit for retracting its claim as soon as we challenged it.If this tale of the extravagant table takes a turn, we'll recalibrate the Truth-O-Meter. But for now, it's registering a rock-solid Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/jul/11/steve-archambault/archambault-says-blue-cross-headquarters-has-30000/

City Council Chairwoman Leslie Curran says Tarpon Springs police drop homeless in St. Petersburg
"," The nickname for it is ""Greyhound therapy."" A police officer comes across a homeless person and gives him a one-way bus ticket out of town to a faraway locale. It's also dubbed ""homeless dumping,"" where officials from one city drive homeless people to another city, drop them off and leave. One city's solution becomes another city's problem, handled in the most impolitic way. Does it happen? Or is it the stuff of urban legend? No one can say for sure, partly because no jurisdiction would ever admit to sticking another place with its homeless problem. Which makes what City Council Chairwoman Leslie Curran said at a May 13 council meeting so extraordinary. Curran implicated Tarpon Springs police Officer Jose Yourgules, and unnamed others, in passing the buck. ""When he comes upon any homeless individual in Tarpon Springs who needs assistance, he brings them to St. Petersburg,"" she said. ""They send them all to St. Petersburg."" Yourgules made this confession at the May 7 Homeless Leadership Network meeting, Curran said. ""I didn't find it amusing,"" Curran said. ""I don't think it's funny that every other city should depend on St. Petersburg to provide social services for everyone in the county."" That does seem unfair, so, really, why does Yourgules do it? Well, not so fast, Yourgules said. ""We don't do that,"" he said. For one, Tarpon Springs doesn't have a big homeless problem. He said the town has about 40 homeless people. Total. As the Police Department's homeless outreach officer, he does come across people who might need help. Does he bring people to St. Petersburg and drop them off at places like St. Vincent de Paul? ""No, that's the worst thing you could do,"" Yourgules said. ""You're not helping them if you do that."" Instead, he said, he calls around to shelters in Pinellas County, checking which ones have open beds. He said that since March 15, he has placed 10 people in shelters. He took four to Pinellas Park, which has two shelters, Pinellas Hope and Touched by an Angel. He took five to Clearwater, which has two shelters, Homeless Emergency Project Inc. and Clearwater Homeless Intervention Project. He has taken only one person to St. Petersburg, to A Turning Point, an alcohol rehabilitation center. We checked it out. Pinellas Hope's facility manager, Angelia Mosley, confirmed that Yourgules brings homeless people to the Pinellas Park shelter. Jeffrey Polhill, president of the Touched by an Angel, said he knows who Yourgules is, but said the shelter doesn't track officers in its records. Neither does Clearwater Homeless Intervention Project, said Larry Passaro, a case manager there. ""I do know that Tarpon Springs police bring people to our shelter,"" Passaro said. Katrina Tucker, program manager for A Turning Point, confirmed that Yourgules had brought only one person to the facility since March 15. Did Yourgules say what Curran said he said? The meetings aren't recorded, so it's unclear. The minutes of the meeting are compiled from typewritten notes of a staffer. They summarize, briefly, that Curran asked Yourgules where he sent people for services and he said ''St. Petersburg."" Sarah Snyder, executive director of Pinellas County Coalition for the Homeless, is responsible for the minutes. She said Yourgules meant that as a joke. ""We told him afterward that there are things you don't joke about,"" Snyder said. But City Council member Herb Polson, who attended the meeting, said Yourgules wasn't joking. Pinellas County Commissioner Ken Welch attended the meeting, but doesn't remember Yourgules speaking. He did find it hard to believe that Yourgules would have said something like that. ""I don't remember any statement about homeless people from north county being brought to St. Petersburg,"" Welch said. Another attendee, former St. Petersburg City Council member Jamie Bennett, said Yourgules did in fact say that. ""I think he just misspoke,"" Bennett said. ""He's brand new. That was his first meeting. I don't think he meant it."" Yourgules said that what he said was misunderstood, but he definitely hadn't been joking. He said Snyder didn't tell him that there are some things you don't joke about. ""What I was trying to say is that up north, there are no services,"" Yourgules said. ""We take them to where the shelters are."" And that's not St. Petersburg, he said. ""Clearwater and Pinellas Park provide more services that we use,"" he said. ""(Curran's) just upset. They are the biggest city, and it has the highest population of the homeless. But we don't bring people there and leave them. That would be unethical."" Curran said she believed him, now. ""All I was reporting is what he said at the time,"" Curran said. ""Nothing on him, but that's just what he said."" The Truth-O-Meter isn't interested in what Yourgules said. That's a good thing, too, considering that there's no recording of the meeting, only vague minutes reflecting what was said. But no one is disputing what Yourgules claims now and what his records show. Four shelters confirmed his records. He takes the majority of the homeless people he finds to shelters, which mostly aren't in St. Petersburg. What we're assessing is Curran's claim that Tarpon Springs takes all of its homeless to St. Petersburg. And we find no evidence to substantiate her blanket statement. We rate her statement False.",/factchecks/2010/jul/09/leslie-curran/city-council-chairwoman-leslie-curran-says-tarpon-/

Trent Franks says top 1 percent pays over half of the entire revenue for U.S.
","
It's a topic for many arguments: What's the fairest way to share the tax burden? In a July 7, 2010, appearance on MSNBC's The Dylan Ratigan Show, U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., made clear that he feels the richest Americans pay too much.

At one point in the interview, Cenk Uygur, the host filling in for Ratigan, asked Franks, ""So, Congressman, if we can't cut defense spending and you don't want to raise taxes on the wealthy, where are you going to get your savings from, the poor and the middle class? Is that right?""

Franks responded, ""No, the fact is, you know, when you're always talking about raising taxes on the rich, I think the top -- the rich now, the top 1 percent, pay over half of the entire revenue for this country. And you don't realize that if you destroy those who have capital, you absolutely devastate those that are trying to get jobs.""

We won't take sides in the argument over the best tax policy, but we do think it's worth checking his statistic that ""the top 1 percent pay over half of the entire revenue for this country.""

We found three problems with Franks' statement.

1. When it comes to the federal income tax (which is only one of many taxes -- more on that later) Frank's ""over half"" estimate is high. According to IRS statistics from the 2007 tax year, the last year available, slightly more than 40 percent of federal income taxes are paid by the top 1 percent. (For that year, it took an adjusted gross income of $410,096 to make it into that elite 1 percent.)

2. The federal income tax isn't the only tax levied by the federal government. It is the biggest when measured by revenue generated, but it doesn't even account for more than half of all federal tax revenue.

The income tax generates 45 percent of federal tax revenue, followed by 36 percent for payroll taxes, 12 percent for corporate income taxes, 3 percent for excise taxes and 4 percent for other taxes.

3. Tax revenues aren't the only form of revenues that fund the government. As we reported in an earlier item, the federal government also collects fees paid to various agencies. In 2009, for example, the government took in the following: the U.S. Postal Service ($69 billion), Medicare premiums ($57 billion), deposits with the Federal Reserve Board ($34.3 billion), customs duties ($21.3 billion), Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. premiums and recoveries ($20.5 billion), auction proceeds from electromagnetic spectrum rights ($16.7 billion), energy sales by the Tennessee Valley Authority ($11.1 billion), natural resources royalties and revenues ($9.9 billion).

Together, these non-tax collections totaled $240 billion, an amount roughly equal to 10 percent of what taxes bring in -- which is more than pocket change.

So are there better yardsticks? There are.

The Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution found that in 2009, the top 1 percent shouldered the burden for roughly 23 percent of all federal taxes. To get to the level Franks' cited -- ""over half"" -- you have to increase the window from 1 percent to 10 percent. That is, the top 10 percent of American earners paid for 52 percent of all federal taxes that year, according to the Tax Policy Center. A big reason for the difference is that the top 1 percent pay 5 percent or less of payroll and excise taxes. (They also pay more than 50 percent of corporate income taxes and more than 70 percent of estate taxes.)

We'll grant that Franks' statement was an off-the-cuff response to a question during a television interview. We'll also acknowledge that the top 1 percent of taxpayers does pay a disproportionate share of taxes generally. Even at 23 percent of the total federal tax burden, that's a lot bigger than their share of the population, and also bigger than their share of income (16 percent). That's the nature of a progressive tax system.

Indeed, it's worth noting that the share being paid by the top 1 percent has generally risen over time. In 1987, the first year after President Ronald Reagan signed a sweeping tax reform bill, the share paid by the top 1 percent stood slightly above 16 percent. The top one-fifth of the population -- what one might call, in Franks' words, ""the rich"" -- is the only fifth, or ""quintile,"" of the population that has seen its share of the tax burden go up during that time.

Still, we can't brush off the inaccuracies in Franks' statement. He makes it sound as if the top 1 percent of the country is shouldering more than half of the burden of funding the federal government, when in fact it's about half that. In addition, the top 1 percent are not even shouldering half of the burden of the income tax by itself. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2010/jul/09/trent-franks/trent-franks-says-top-1-percent-pays-over-half-ent/

Palin says U.S. ranks 25th in defense spending ranking
","In a June 30, 2010, Facebook post, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin posted excerpts from a speech she gave in Norfolk, Va., primarily on national security. At one point, she said, ""Did you know the U.S. actually only ranks 25th worldwide on defense spending as a percentage of GDP?""We didn't, so we decided to check up on her statistic.We quickly tracked down the chart from which we suspect she pulled her factoid. (Her staff didn't return our e-mail query.) It's a credible source -- the CIA World Factbook -- and, as Palin said, the U.S. does rank 25th in the world, spending an estimated 4.06 percent of GDP on defense in 2005.Case closed? Not really.The list includes all countries, regardless of size, so some tiny countries outrank the United States on the CIA list. There's Eritrea at number 9 (with an economy about 1/1000th of the size of the U.S. economy); Burundi at number 11 (with an economy that's even less than 1/1000th the size of the U.S. economy); and Maldives at 13th (with an economy roughly the same size as Burundi's).Given this competition, several other states on the CIA's list seem like veritable economic powerhouses, such as Mauritania at 14th, Swaziland at 19th and Brunei at 22nd.Many of the states on the CIA list are modest-sized but live in a high-tension neighborhood -- the Middle East. They include the top seven, which are, in descending order, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, Israel and Yemen. A bit lower on the list are Syria, Kuwait, Turkey and Bahrain.All told, only four nations on the CIA list could be described as either industrialized democracies or major world players. They are Israel (6th), Turkey (16th), China (23rd) and Greece (24th).Is there a better yardstick? We think there is -- using rankings of members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD is a group of 31 nations that are generally large, industrialized democracies. This list makes the comparison closer to one of peers.To make this comparison, we looked at a comprehensive table of defense spending compared to GDP that was published by the World Bank. First, two caveats: The figures are more recent than the ones used to create the CIA list, so they don't compare exactly. And we should note that varying definitions and a tendency toward secrecy make international military comparisons tricky.That said, compared to its 30 fellow members of the OECD, the U.S. trailed only one other member nation, Israel (at 8 percent of GDP, compared to 4.3 percent for the U.S.). In fact, the U.S. rate is double the rate of many of its peers. We also looked at China and Russia -- two nuclear powers that do not belong to the OECD -- and both of them also trail the U.S. in this measurement.Todd Harrison, a fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said other factors set the U.S. apart.""In absolute dollars, we spend almost as much as all other countries combined,"" Harrison said. ""So saying we are 25th is a bit misleading and a selective use of facts.""We agree. Although she's technically correct, the numbers are wildly skewed by tiny, non-industrialized countries. We find her claim Barely True. ",/factchecks/2010/jul/09/sarah-palin/palin-says-us-ranks-25th-defense-spending-ranking/

(We also checked another statement from the same post, that the U.S. ""only ranks 25th worldwide on defense spending as a percentage of GDP."" We gave that one a Barely True. Let's preface this discussion by noting that federal budgeting involves extremely arcane categories and that various measures can be plausible yardsticks in analyzing this question.The one we chose was the baseline projection included in the president's fiscal year 2011 budget proposal. (That's Table S-3 for budget nerds.) The figure for fiscal year 2009 -- the last complete fiscal year -- shows the following breakdown:• Appropriated security programs: $782 billion• Mandatory programs (includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, among other programs): $2.112 trillion• Net interest: $187 billionIf you add together mandatory programs and the net interest, then divide that by the amount spent on security programs, the ratio is 2.93 -- very close to the ""three times more"" that Palin cites.Here are some caveats. The appropriated security programs category includes the nuclear weapons portion of the Energy Department, the Department of Homeland Security, portions of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of State and other international programs. Defense programs account for about 80 percent of the total, but not the entire amount.Meanwhile, if you total up the budget for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- the three big entitlements most familiar to Americans -- it accounts for about two-thirds of the budget for mandatory programs. The ""other mandatory programs"" category includes such things as veterans' benefits. Despite these distinctions, we think it's reasonable for Palin to describe all security programs as ""defense"" and all mandatory programs as ""entitlements.""

Olbermann says oil and gas subsidies account for 88 percent of all federal subsidies
","The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has brought renewed attention to government subsidies conferred upon the oil and gas industry. Keith Olbermann, the liberal host of the MSNBC prime-time show Countdown, took the issue of the oil and gas industry head-on during the show that aired July 6, 2010.

He cited reports by the Center for American Progress -- a liberal think tank -- that outlined ""nine different subsidies that the U.S. government gives to an industry that makes more money than any other industry, including refunds for drilling costs and refunds to cover the cost of searching for oil. Subsidies for oil and gas companies make up 88 percent of all federal subsidies. Just cutting the oil and gas subsidies out would save the U.S. government $45 billion every year.""

The last two sentences are the ones that stuck out to us. Given the wide range of subsidies the government grants, notably agricultural subsidies, do those for the oil and gas industry really account for 88 percent of the total? And do oil and gas subsidies really amount to $45 billion per year, which is equivalent to more than 2 percent of all federal revenues?

We'll take them in order. ""Subsidies for oil and gas companies make up 88 percent of all federal subsidies."" We tracked down the Center for American Progress paper the statistic was drawn from -- ""Pumping Tax Dollars to Big Oil: Getting Government Priorities Right on Tax Subsidies for Oil Companies,"" published on April 14, 2010, by Sima J. Gandhi, a senior economic policy analyst with the center.

In the paper, Gandhi wrote, ""Tax expenditures are government spending through the tax code. They are distributed through deductions, exclusions, credits, exemptions, preferential tax rates, and deferrals. What makes them look different from grants or checks is that they are delivered through the tax code as part of tax expenditure spending programs. These tax expenditures can amount to a significant portion of federal subsidies for oil and gas. The cost of tax expenditure programs for oil and gas companies made up about 88 percent of total federal subsidies in 2006.""

When we read that, it sounded to us like Gandhi was saying that 88 percent of all oil and gas subsidies were accomplished through the tax code -- not that 88 percent of all federal subsidies went to the oil and gas industry.

To check that, we contacted Gandhi. She confirmed our suspicion and pointed us to her original source -- a 2006 paper published by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, a state office. The paper includes a detailed table and says that ""various taxes represented approximately 87.4 percent of federal government subsidies for oil and gas in 2006.""

So it's clear to us that Olbermann misstated that statistic.

""Cutting the oil and gas subsidies out would save the U.S. government $45 billion every year."" This one proved even easier to check. We located a different Center for American Progress paper by Gandhi, ""Eliminating Tax Subsidies for Oil Companies,"" published on May 13, 2010. In it, she outlines nine different types of subsidies (Olbermann was right about that number) and concludes that ""the total government savings from eliminating these subsidies is projected to be $45 billion over 10 years.""

That's $45 billion over 10 years, not one year, as Olbermann had said.

We aren't qualified to judge the accuracy of the Center for American Progress' statistics, which may well draw criticism from conservatives. But Olbermann clearly muffed it twice when he repeated them incorrectly to viewers -- and by a substantial margin -- giving viewers the impression that oil and gas subsidies are 10 times more expensive than they actually are. Because of this, we considered rating his comment Pants on Fire, but his errors seemed to us to be sloppy rather than devious. So we'll give him a rating of False. Postscript: On his show on July 9, 2010, Olbermann acknowledged the error: ""One last note on the subject of oil. An apology and thank you, apologies to you for getting this wrong this past Tuesday. ""We said the oil and gas industry gets 88 percent of all federal subsidies. Not true. A report by the Center for American Progress concluded that 88 percent of federal subsidies to oil and gas came in the form of tax breaks and credits and so forth. We all misread it. The buck stops here so I apologize for passing on the wrong info to you.

""Cutting oil and gas subsidies would save $45 billion, but that's over 10 years, not in the one year we reported. So, our apologies again -- and our thanks to PolitiFact.com which brought this to light and guessed correctly that we misread the report, and our thanks to them for only rating our report ""false"" rather than their other option 'pants on fire.'""

Texas Democratic Party chairman says Rep. Ken Legler voted against installing generators and fire sprinklers in nursing homes
","
In an e-mail soliciting donations to the Texas Democratic Party, Boyd Richie calls three Texas House members ""tone-deaf Republicans whose agendas don’t align with Texans’ priorities."" 
""It’s time to throw the bums out,"" the Democratic Party chairman writes in the June 16 blast. 
Among the D-designated bums: state Rep. Ken Legler, R-Pasadena, who Richie says ""voted against installing fire sprinklers and emergency power generators in nursing homes."" 
For real? That fired us up. 
Kirsten Gray, the party’s communications director, pointed us to a supplemental appropriations bill the House voted on in April 2009. During floor action, Rep. Kristi Thibaut, D-Houston, introduced an amendment to earmark state funds for the Department of Aging and Disability Services to determine the need for back-up generators in Texas nursing facilities, establish a priority list of facilities in case the need exceeded available state funds and allocate state aid to purchase and install the generators. 
Rep. Carol Kent, D-Dallas, amended the amendment (everyone still with us?) so the study and subsequent installation would also take into account fire sprinklers. 
Jennifer Brader, Thibaut’s chief of staff, told us Thibaut’s amendment was motivated by Hurricane Rita, which she said disrupted electric power at nursing homes on the coast. ""After Rita, it was a couple weeks before everyone got their electricity back on,"" Brader said. ""A constituent in the district brought it to Kristi’s attention."" 
The revised amendment, penciling in about $46.7 million for the department to focus on emergency generators and sprinklers, passed 75-66. Legler was recorded as voting ""no."" 
Legler voted for the overall supplemental appropriation act — including the sprinkler amendment — which passed the House 141-5. However, the amendment was subsequently removed by the Senate Finance Committee and did not pass into law. 
Legler told us that he voted against the nursing home amendment because it was too vague;  there were ""no parameters on how to spend $47 million of taxpayers’ money,"" he said, including no direction on how the department would determine that facilities needed back-up generators. 
Legler also said he didn’t see the point in appropriating money to make improvements in nursing homes when they would soon have to do so themselves anyway. In August 2008, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services had ruled that all nursing homes had to install automatic sprinkler systems by Aug. 13, 2013. Homes are required to pay for the systems, DADS spokeswoman Allison Lowery told us. 
According to DADS, there are 1,165 licensed nursing homes in Texas, including 26 that do not have sprinkler systems throughout. In August 2008, 40 homes lacked sprinklers throughout and as of March 2009, shortly before the House voted on the amendment in question, 27 homes didn’t have sprinklers throughout. 
Lowery said the agency doesn’t have a formal plan in place to bring the 26 facilities up to code, but by 2012 facilities will need to show that they’re working to comply with CMS — getting bids from contractors to install the sprinkler system, for example. While nursing homes aren’t required to have back-up generators, Lowery said, all but a few do, because homes are required by state law to have emergency lighting. 
Where does this history leave Chairman Richie’s charge? 
All told, his statement leaves out a lot. 
Legler voted against an amendment that would have paid for DADS to survey which Texas nursing homes needed emergency generators and fire sprinklers and to purchase and install them. At the time of the vote, nearly all Texas nursing homes already had backup generators, according to the state, and more than 97 percent of Texas nursing homes had installed sprinklers. Remaining facilities without sprinklers were facing a federal mandate to follow suit, at their own expense; the amendment could have enabled them to do so at no cost to themselves. 
By implying that Legler was an opponent of nursing home safety, Richie’s statement painted the situation as far more dire and widespread than it really was. 
His statement is Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",/factchecks/2010/jul/09/boyd-richie/texas-democratic-party-chairman-says-rep-ken-legle/

Raimondo says hers is the only venture capital company in Rhode Island
","In her quest to become general treasurer, Democrat Gina Raimondo is stressing her Rhode Island roots and her financial experience. In a YouTube video available through her website, she talks about wanting to come back to the state to start a business.""I wanted to create a company, create a business, in Rhode Island. I could have chosen to put it elsewhere, but I wanted it in Providence. So I came home and created it. It's called Point Judith Capital, and it's the only venture capital firm in Rhode Island. I'm very proud of what we've built.""Venture capitalists are people who raise money from entities such as private investors and public pension funds, and then invest it in start-up companies, hoping for a big return if those companies take off. It's a risky proposition, which is why there are not a lot of them around.But we thought Rhode Island had others besides Point Judith.So we called Richard G. Horan, senior managing director of the Slater Technology Fund, which also gives money to start-up companies. It turns out that there are other groups in Rhode Island that serve a similar function, but they are not truly venture capital firms in the strict sense, which supports Raimondo's claim.""There are others engaged in venture investment, but they have a different orientation,"" said Horan.Slater, for example, is publicly funded. It was created by the state in 1997 to stimulate the creation of new companies that focus on technology and is financed annually by the General Assembly.The Slater Fund typically invests up to a million dollars in  ""seed"" money at the earliest stage of a company's development, with the expectation that a traditional venture capital firm, such as Raimondo's, will make a play to be involved in the company and provide the next round of funding.Another class, known as angel investors, also provides start-up money for promising businesses. They are represented in the state by the Cherrystone Angel Group. ""They tend to be individual investors acting like investment clubs"" and think of themselves as being in a separate class from venture capital firms, said Horan.Peter Dorsey, executive director of Cherrystone, agreed, explaining that his group, with 50 members, differs from a venture capital firm because it is not a committed fund, not professionally managed and doesn't have a paid staff.Finally, people often think of private equity firms, such as Providence Equity Partners, as being involved in venture capital, but they invest only in mature companies, he said. Providence Equity, for example, specializes in enterprises that deal with media, communications and information.So both Dorsey and Horan agree with Raimondo, who told The Providence Journal on Jan. 20 that she would quit Point Judith Capital if she is elected.Point Judith is ""the one capital venture fund based here in Rhode Island,"" Horan said, adding that, ""We need more. The Rhode Island entrepreneurial community would benefit greatly if other firms like Point Judith were established and operating here.""So we rate Raimondo's claim as True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/09/gina-raimondo/raimondo-says-hers-only-venture-capital-company-rh/

When I was governor, I signed them,"" said Barnes, who was governor from 1999 to 2003. ""We all have sinned and fallen short of the Lord. But when you tell everybody the choices are between all of these exemptions and keeping teachers in the classroom, I believe the teachers win, the children win.""Has the former governor flip-flopped on this issue? We wanted to take a closer look.A little state political history here. Barnes did two stints in the state Legislature, from 1974 to 1990 and from 1992 to 1998. In 1998, he was elected the state's 80th governor.But despite vastly superior funding Barnes lost a re-election bid in 2002 to an underdog, a former state senator named Sonny Perdue. Barnes had angered supporters of the old Georgia state flag, which he changed to minimize its Confederate emblem. And then he ran afoul of some state residents because of what they perceived as heavy-handed tactics when new political boundaries were drawn during redistricting.Some political observers, however, believe Barnes' real roadblock in the 2002 defeat was the state's 125,000 public school teachers. As governor, Barnes angered many of those educators with his ambitous school reforms. Many educators felt Barnes blamed them for low test scores, poor graduation rates and other failings. The former governor is now heading into the July 20 Democratic primary trying to win back those teacher votes. In June, Barnes took the extraordinary step of filming a 90-second video apologizing to Georgia's teachers for not listening enough to them when he attempted to implement some of his education reforms.Now, he is promising to remove some of the very same tax exemptions for business that he supported as a state lawmaker and governor to help teachers. As governor, Barnes approved tax exemptions on the sale of solar panels, a corporate tax credit for a Macon-based tobacco manufacturing plant and Girl Scout cookies. Jeffrey Humphreys, a prominent economist, said most states offer tax breaks and exemptions for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it's done as a deliberate strategy to help some industries grow. Sometimes it's done to lower the consumer costs on some items. Humphreys said it's often done to be competitive with other states.""They don't want to be out of step with other states competing for jobs,"" said Humphreys, director of the University of Georgia's Selig Center for Economic Growth.Humphreys believes revenue collections are more stable with fewer exemptions.Sarah Beth Gehl, deputy director of the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, said some exemptions are worthwhile, but others are ""purely political giveaways."" She agrees many of them should be re-examined.Barnes explained that some of the exemptions have hurt funding for education. The exemptions Barnes voted for and signed as governor cost Georgia, and saved the recipients, at least $1.2 billion a year, state fiscal notes show. School boards across Georgia have slashed their budgets -- and jobs, in some cases -- in recent months to balance their financial books. One problem many of them have cited is receiving less money from the state.Barnes has said he wouldn't touch some of the larger breaks, such as the tax exemptions on the sale of many groceries and prescription drugs. As governor he'd like the authority to suspend or eliminate others, until there is more funding for education. A new commission was recently created that could make changes to some of these tax breaks and exemptions. Humphreys is on the commission.We asked the Barnes camp which exemptions it would cut. It didn't offer specifics, focusing on exemptions approved under the Perdue administration.""All the special interest income and sales tax exemptions passed over the past several years need to be put on the table for temporary suspension,"" Barnes campaign manager Chris Carpenter said in an e-mail.Carpenter argued this is not a political flip-flop. Carpenter said state government is currently in a tougher financial pinch than when Barnes was governor. The exemptions approved under the Barnes administration never resulted in drastic actions, such as teacher furloughs, Carpenter said. Perdue, however, found the state's finances were in worse shape than previously thought when he succeeded Barnes in 2003.Yes, Barnes has changed his position on some exemptions. But Barnes still believes some of the breaks -- and some very large ones -- should stay in place. Because of that, Barnes sidestepped a full Flip Flop on the Truth-o-Meter. He gets a Half-Flip.",/factchecks/2010/jul/09/roy-barnes/barnes-now-opposes-some-business-tax-breaks-he-onc/

Alex Sink says Florida's grad rates are low
","Like any good Democrat, gubernatorial hopeful Alex Sink has a habit of highlighting the state's mediocre public education record. Voters need look no further than her campaign website, where she laments student achievement records.""Florida’s high school graduation rate falls well below the national average,"" reads her campaign website. ""That’s unacceptable, especially as we work to build a new and stronger Florida economy.""The campaign did not respond to a request for Sink's source, but we found plenty of information that shows Florida is far from the head of the class when it comes to graduation rates. The National Center for Education Statistics puts the national average graduation rate at 73.9 percent based on the class of 2006-2007 in a 2010 report. It determined Florida, with a rate of 65 percent, was among 11 states and the District of Columbia with graduation rates below 70 percent. In fact, Florida fell below the national average every year from 2001 to 2007. The report only counted traditional diplomas. Diplomas Count 2010, another respected education report, also puts Florida's graduation rate below the national average for every school year from 2005 through 2007, the most recent years available. For example, the graduation rate for Florida's class of 2007 was 62.1 percent. The national rate was 68.8 percent. Only nine other states and the District of Columbia also scored below 65 percent.Diplomas Count reached its results counting only students receiving standard high school diplomas. Recipients of General Educational Development diplomas, certificates of attendance and other nondiploma credentials were treated as nongraduates.We found only one source that somewhat countered Sink's claim, and it's an interesting one -- the Florida Department of Education.Spokesman Cheryl Etters said national reports are not the most credible source of information because each ranking and state may use different ""graduate"" definitions. For example, Florida counts students who obtain a GED in two of its graduation counts. But Diplomas Count 2010 and other education research groups do not. In all, the state calculates three graduation rates: We decided to compare these numbers to the national graduation rates we had for that school year, even though it wouldn't be an exact comparison.Florida's figures all fell below the National Center for Education Statistics 2007 national graduation rate of 73.9 percent, thus backing Sink's claim.Florida's numbers were higher than the national graduation rate of 68.8 percent published in Diplomas Count 2010, but that's most likely because Diplomas Count has a more narrow ""graduate"" definition. In short, multiple calculations determined Florida's graduation rate falls below the national average. As for the ""well below,"" part of Sink's claim, both the National Center for Education Statistics and Diplomas Count put Florida among the bottom third of all the states. And, while Florida's most recent graduation rates show improvement -- during the 2008-2009 school year, the regular graduation rate rose to 78.6, the No Child Left Behind graduation rate rose to 76.2, and the National Governors Association rate climbed to 76.3 -- national groups have yet to evaluate the latest data, so we can't determine whether Florida has finally surpassed the average national graduation rate. Based on what we know and the latest data, we say Sink passed the test. We give this a True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/08/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-floridas-grad-rates-are-low/
