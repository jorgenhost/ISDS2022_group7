No, Nike didn’t say it could afford to lose all MAGA customers
","If you’re wondering whether you should confirm that a company actually said something before you share it on the internet, please — just do it.  A recent Facebook post recycles an old, already-debunked claim that Nike said, ""We’re a $76 Billion dollar company that can afford to let go of all ‘Make America Great Again’ customers."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, Nike’s market capitalization as of Sept. 8 is about $176 billion, not $76 billion.   Searching online and in the Nexis news archive we found no evidence that Nike ever made such a statement. We reached out to Nike about the claim and didn’t immediately hear back, but a spokesperson for the company told the Associated Press that the quote is fake. This fabricated statement has been online since at least 2018, when Nike named former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick as the face of its new ""Just Do It"" campaign. The decision drew anger from some who disapproved of Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem before football games as a means of protest against police brutality and racial inequality.  Snopes reported at the time that the earliest reference to the statement that appears in the Facebook post may have been on Sept. 4, 2018, when someone tweeted that ""on NPR this morning, NIKE stated, ‘We did all the math. We’re a $76 billion dollar company that can afford to let go of all ‘Make America Great Again’ customers. We would rather be on the right side of history.""  During an interview with NPR that morning, Justin Tinsley, a writer for the publication The Undefeated, said that though some social media posts showed people burning their Nike shoes, Nike wants ""to be on the right side of history."" ""They’re not going to take a drastic hit from the bottom line,"" Tinsley said. ""And at the end of the day, Nike — again, this is an internationally known, multibillion-dollar company. They’ve done the math. They’ve done the bottom line probably hundreds of times over. And they know the benefit that can come from this.""

No, Joe Biden doesn’t want to impose a federal tax on homes
","A  widely shared post on Facebook falsely claims that millions of homeowners across the country could see a tax hike if Joe Biden is elected president in November. ""Biden wants to put a 3% annual federal tax on your home,"" the Sept. 6 post says. ""Do you want him for POTUS?"" The post, which has been shared thousands of times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) If you’re reading this, you may be wondering: Is there some truth to the claim? (Screenshot from Facebook) We reached out to the original poster for their evidence, but we haven’t heard back. We could find nothing in Biden’s platform or independent assessments of his tax plan that would indicate he supports imposing an annual federal tax on homes. First, let’s briefly review which kinds of taxes apply to property owners. Taxes are divided between federal, state and local governments. One common type is property tax, which is determined at the state and local levels. The effective property tax rate varies from state to state and city to city. Property taxes are a key source of revenue for cities and counties, and school districts tend to rely on them. Homeowners can pay these taxes as part of their monthly mortgage payments or to a local tax assessor on an annual basis. The main federal tax that the Internal Revenue Service imposes on real estate is the capital gains tax. A capital gain is the difference between what someone paid for an asset, also known as the ""basis,"" and what they sold it for.  For example, if you purchased a house for $250,000 and sold it for $300,000, your capital gain would be $50,000. However, the IRS typically lets sellers deduct up to $250,000 in capital gains if they’re single and $500,000 if they’re married and file joint tax returns, so you probably wouldn’t owe anything. Biden has not proposed a nationwide property tax — nor has he advocated raising taxes on Americans making less than $400,000 per year, as we’ve previously reported.  An analysis from the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center says Biden’s plan would primarily raise income and payroll taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations. The tax hikes would increase federal revenues by $4 trillion over the next decade, according to the analysis. ""Under his plan, the highest-income households would see substantially larger tax increases than households in other income groups, both in dollar amounts and as a share of their incomes,"" the report says. Other independent groups have also examined Biden’s tax plan, including the Tax Foundation, the Penn Wharton Budget Model, the American Enterprise Institute and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Here are a few of the plan’s specific components: Increase the top corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. Raise the top federal marginal income tax rate for individuals to 39.6%. Place a 12.4% Social Security payroll tax on incomes above $400,000. Tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners. RELATED: Donald Trump Jr. misrepresents Joe Biden’s tax plan None of those reports say Biden wants to impose a ""3% annual federal tax on your home,"" as the Facebook post claimed.  ""Based on our review of the campaign materials and our conversations with the campaign to try and clarify what their proposals are … there’s nothing there,"" said Gordon Mermin, a senior research associate in the Tax Policy Center. ""We haven’t encountered anything that could be construed as a tax on homes."" On his campaign website, Biden says he supports creating tax credits for first-time homebuyers and low-income families who rent. We could find no mention of a nationwide property tax. We reached out to the campaign for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. The Facebook post is inaccurate.

Johnson is mostly on track with claim that flu is harder on kids than COVID-19
","As schools across the country open for the uncertain, unprecedented school year to come, opinions are split on how to do so safely.  Some districts have opted for completely virtual learning. Others will try a mix of both online and in-person classes, or will send younger children to school while older kids stay home, or will phase students back to the classroom gradually.  Others still are calling for schools to reopen completely for those who feel well enough to teach and attend, and who aren’t especially vulnerable to COVID-19.   One such voice is U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, who in an Aug. 13, 2020 radio interview with Milwaukee talk show host Steve Scaffidi on WTMJ-AM discussed why he believes students need to return to school in person this fall.  For younger people, Johnson asserted, ""seasonal flu is actually, in many cases, a deadlier virus if they contract that.""  Is Johnson correct that COVID-19 is less deadly for children than the flu?  Let’s dig in.  COVID was less harsh on kids than the flu, this year’s stats show To back up his claim, Johnson’s office sent statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on flu and COVID-19 deaths among Americans under age 18. During the 2018-19 flu season, the CDC reported approximately 480 flu deaths among children ages 0-17, about 30% of whom had a lab-confirmed case of influenza. Comparably, 90 American youth have died from coronavirus complications from the beginning of the pandemic through mid-August, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.  More than 46,000 children were hospitalized for flu in that 2018-19 period. The hospitalization rate among children 5 to 17 was 39.2 children per 100,000 children. For COVID-19, that hospitalization rate is 6 per 100,000 children ages 5 to 17, the CDC says. In a report detailing the differences between COVID-19 and the flu, the CDC states that ""the risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared to COVID-19."" And data from Wisconsin echoes that sentiment. Since the pandemic began, no children have died from COVID-19 complications, according to state Department of Health Services death data, and 147 people ages 0-19 have been hospitalized. In contrast, three pediatric flu deaths occurred during this year’s flu season, DHS data show, and 605 kids ages 17 and under have been hospitalized.  The data show there have been fewer childhood deaths from COVID-19 so far this year than from the seasonal flu.  The hold-up, of course, lies in nuance, said Dr. Jon Temte, associate dean for public health and community engagement within UW-Madison’s School of Medicine and Public Health.  ""U.S. schools have been out (and) mostly closed since March, thus extremely limiting cases of SARS-CoV-2 in children. Conversely, we rarely close schools for influenza, thus allowing an attack rate of 30-40% in school-aged children,"" Temte wrote in an Aug. 27, 2020 email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.  That is, the flu has been able to spread through children more commonly than COVID-19, creating more cases, more complications and more deaths.  Other experts agree. Dr. Chad Vercio, chair of pediatrics at Riverside University Health System in California, said children’s risk from the coronavirus depends on how widespread the virus is in any given area, and that ""it is unknown"" if COVID hospitalization rates would rise once schools reopen. And though the early data suggests that COVID-19 is not as bad for children as the flu, it’s just that: Early.  Dr. Vidya Mony, an infectious disease expert with Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, Calif., said there isn’t enough data yet to say indisputably that COVID risks are lower for kids. Johnson claimed that in many cases, the seasonal flu was a deadlier virus for youth than COVID-19.  The numbers show that this year, that was the case. More children died from flu complications than from COVID-19, and were hospitalized at higher rates for the flu.  But experts caution that we don’t have enough data to paint the full picture so early in the game, and that schools shutting down in early spring may have driven down coronavirus case rates in children — meaning we can’t be sure exactly how the virus will move through young people when more of them are potentially getting exposed.  Our definition for Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""  That fits here.   ",/factchecks/2020/sep/08/ron-johnson/johnson-mostly-track-claim-flu-harder-kids-covid-1/

No, Sen. Kamala Harris hasn’t been convicted of a felony
","Misinformation about Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris has flourished online since Joe Biden selected her as running mate. One popular theme is the false claim that Harris does not meet eligibility requirements. Here’s a new variation on that theme:  ""Kamala Harris is not able to be VP. Because she's a felon. She lied on her application to buy a gun here in CA,"" reads a Sept. 1 post that was shared thousands of times. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) ""Is this true?"" one Facebook user wrote in the post’s comments. No, reader, it is not true. There is no evidence Harris has ever been convicted of a felony. We searched news archives and court records and found nothing of that sort.  PolitiFact reached out to the Facebook user for evidence to support the claim, but he did not respond. The post was made private or deleted soon after. Harris, a former California attorney general who has a reputation for having been a tough-on-crime prosecutor, has been a member of the State Bar of California since June 1990, and her law license is still active. The State Bar of California website displays Harris’ license history, including ""all changes of license status due to both non-disciplinary administrative matters and disciplinary actions.""  If she had been charged with a crime or convicted, the state bar would have been notified. If she had been convicted of a felony, she would have been ""placed on interim suspension pending a disciplinary hearing on the merits in State Bar Court,"" according to the state bar website. Harris has no disciplinary record and her license has not been suspended. In 2019, a spokesperson for Harris' presidential campaign confirmed that Harris owned a handgun that she had purchased years earlier. Since at least 2012, people seeking to buy a gun in California have faced a 10-day waiting period and background check to ensure the buyer is eligible to own one under California law. A person convicted of a felony cannot buy one. While Harris was attorney general, her office released the 2013 California Firearms Laws Summary, which explained that gun buyers are required to provide personal information to the seller and wait 10 days while a background check is completed. We find no evidence Harris violated these requirements, but we also were unable to verify where her gun was purchased. The Harris campaign declined to comment for this fact-check. All that said, even if Harris had been convicted of a felony at some point, this would not prevent her from becoming vice president or assuming the presidency. The requirements are the same for people seeking to become vice president or president, according to experts: A person must be a natural-born citizen, be at least 35 years old and have lived in the U.S. for at least 14 years.  Harris meets these requirements and is eligible to be president or vice president.

No, USPS isn’t operating with a multibillion dollar surplus
","Twenty-six House Republicans joined Democrats last month in supporting legislation to send $25 billion to the U.S. Postal Service and to block any changes to postal operations until after the election. The list included two of Illinois’ five GOP congressmen. U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood, however, was not one of them. Asked during a TV appearance to explain why he voted against the measure, LaHood questioned the need for that financial support. ""The post office right now, this year, is operating with about a $12 billion surplus,"" he said on WTTW’s ""Chicago Tonight"" Aug. 24 broadcast. ""The money isn’t necessary to get us through the election. That’s been a political football."" His assertions come as the Trump administration is taking heat for removing hundreds of sorting machines and yanking mailboxes in the walk up to an election that will rely on the postal service more than any other election in the country's history. USPS says it has ""ample capacity"" to handle an influx of mail-in ballots this fall. But the agency’s shaky financial footing is a well-known and longstanding problem: USPS hasn’t recorded a profit in any year since 2006 and saw a net loss of $2.2 billion in the most recent fiscal quarter. So we decided to find out what LaHood was talking about when he said the agency was running a surplus. ""He was referring to the fact that the USPS had almost $13 billion cash on hand, as of June 30th,"" LaHood spokesman John Rauber wrote in an email, echoing a point made in the White House’s statement of administration policy opposing the bill. That figure is backed up by USPS’ latest quarterly report. Cash on hand — or unrestricted cash, as the agency calls it — is not a surplus by any definition, according to experts. Instead, it refers to the amount of money the agency has in the bank at a given time. The USPS reports its net income — also known as a profit — or net loss at the end of each fiscal period, in accordance with accepted accounting standards. Referring to cash on hand as a surplus ""doesn’t make sense,"" said David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution. ""The word ‘surplus’ suggests that the Postal Service’s revenues exceed its expenses,"" he said. ""They don’t. The Postal Service has been operating at a loss — certified by independent accountants and reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission — since 2007."" In the last fiscal year, USPS brought in just over $71 billion in revenue. But it also shelled out nearly $80 billion to pay its carriers and cover expenses, including retiree benefits. A 2006 law made the agency responsible for prefunding future retiree health benefits, placing additional strain on its bottom line, which has also suffered over the years from declines in first-class and marketing mail. The postal service has run at a loss ever since. ""It's not even breaking even on its annual expenses and its annual income,"" said G. William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and former Republican staff director for the Senate Budget Committee. ""I don't know how anybody could say they have a surplus."" LaHood said, ""the post office right now, this year, is operating with about a $12 billion surplus."" His spokesman told us he was referencing the nearly $13 billion ""cash on hand"" the agency reported at the end of June. But cash on hand is not a surplus, experts said.

Making point on overlooked Black history, Biden misses mark on the inventor of the light bulb
","Race was a key issue in Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s first campaign stop in Wisconsin on Sept. 3, 2020. He spoke with Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man whose shooting at the hands of a Kenosha police officer sparked a week of sometimes violent protests. And he participated in a community meeting at a Kenosha church where many speakers addressed challenges and inequities faced by people of color. It was there Biden made one particularly eyebrow-raising claim, accusing schools of teaching inaccurate history. ""Why in God’s name don’t we teach history in history classes?"" said a facemask-wearing Biden, leaning in toward one attendee to emphasize his point. ""A Black man invented the light bulb, not a white guy named Edison, OK?"" Biden went on to say, ""There’s so much, did anybody know before what recently happened, that Black Wall Street in Oklahoma was burned to the ground? Anybody know these things? … We don’t teach them. We’ve got to give people facts."" Thomas Edison, of course, is widely acknowledged as the inventor of the lightbulb — among many other things. Is Biden right that someone else should get the credit? The road to the modern incandescent bulb was a meandering one, with many inventors contributing over a period of decades. Electric power was developed in the early 19th Century, and inventors immediately set about applying this development to lighting. Many early attempts focused on arc lighting, in which a bright light is created by electricity sparking between two points, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. When arc lighting was too bright and required too much power, prompting a pivot to an incandescent solution.  Among the key early developments, according to Britannica and other sources: 1801 — English chemist Sir Humphry Davy demonstrated strips heated by electricity would glow, but his filaments didn’t last long. 1841 — Frederick de Moleyns of England received the first patent for an incandescent lamp, using powdered charcoal between two platinum wires. 1865 — The mercury pump is developed, allowing the glowing filament to be placed in a vacuum, which made it glow longer. 1878 — English physicist Sir Joseph Wilson Swan developed a carbon-filament bulb. 1879 — Thomas Edison developed his carbon-filament bulb, enclosed in a superior vacuum to extend the life of the filament. Swan and Edison both applied for patents in 1880, prompting litigation that dragged on until the two formed a joint company in 1883. ""Edison has always received the major credit for inventing the lightbulb, because of his development of the power lines and other equipment needed to establish the incandescent lamp in a practical lighting system,"" the Britannica entry said. A profile of Edison in Time Magazine in 1979 summarized Edison’s role this way: ""Above all, Edison invented the first practical electric light, and a power-distribution system that put it cheaply into every home."" We should note, all of the inventors referenced here were white. So who is Biden referring to? A spokesman said Biden was referencing Lewis Latimer, a prolific inventor who worked with both Edison and Alexander Graham Bell (credited with inventing the telephone). Latimer did indeed play a key role in the spread of electric lighting. He was a member of the elite ""Edison’s Pioneers"" research team and wrote the first book in the United States on electric lighting in 1890, according to a biography on the MIT website. Latimer also oversaw electric lighting installation in the streets and buildings of New York, Philadelphia, London and other cities, according to a 1988 New York Times story. Most notably for the question at hand, Latimer developed a filament that lasted longer than those developed by Edison and others, making the widespread use of electric lighting more feasible. He received a patent in September 1881 for ""new and useful improvements in incandescent electric lamps."" That was a year and a half after Edison received an electric lamp patent in January 1880. Biden’s general point in referencing Latimer and Black Wall Street — a Tulsa, OK. neighborhood where up to 300 people are believed to have died in race riots in 1921 — is a lack of education on Black history in America. But his specific claim in making that point overreaches. Speaking in Kenosha, Biden said, ""A Black man invented the light bulb, not a white guy named Edison."" The Black man referenced here, Latimer, did indeed play an important role in the development and adaptation of the incandescent light bulb. So did many other inventors in the decades preceding Edison’s patent.  Edison certainly wasn’t the sole inventor. He built on the work of others. While Biden may have a point about the need to better teach Black history, he greatly exaggerates in his example by minimizing Edison to credit only Latimer. All the evidence we’ve reviewed shows Latimer played a lesser role than Edison, and later in the process. We define Mostly False as a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

The report cited leaked documents that indicated the ambassador was under investigation for routinely ditching his security detail ""to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children,"" and that a high-ranking official at the department directed investigators to ""cease the investigation.""  The State Department’s Office of the Inspector General looked into whether the department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security mishandled the investigation into the ambassador, along with seven others. The inspector general’s review was released in October 2014 and found that, in three of the cases, a combination of factors created ""an appearance of undue influence and favoritism by Department management.""

""I am angered and saddened by the baseless allegations that have appeared in the press, and to watch the four years I have proudly served in Belgium smeared is devastating,"" Gutman said in a statement to news outlets. ""At no point have I ever engaged in any improper activity."" The inspector general’s review said Gutman denied the allegations during a meeting with two officials and was then permitted to return to work. The review found that the suspected misconduct by Gutman was not substantiated, but noted that further evidence could have been collected, and recommended the department establish ""clear and consistent protocols and procedures"" in the future.  A story recirculating online claims that NBC reported that Hillary Clinton covered up an ""elite pedophile ring"" at the state department. That’s inaccurate. NBC news reported in 2013 about leaked memos that claimed some internal investigations at the State Department were mishandled, one of which included an allegation of pedophilia. An inspector general’s report found that department officials could have taken further steps to thoroughly investigate multiple cases, but noted the allegations made against an ambassador were ultimately unsubstantiated.  At no point in NBC’s report, or in the inspector general’s review, does it say that Clinton was the one who stopped investigations, or that she ""covered up"" an ""elite pedophile ring.""  We rate this False.",/factchecks/2020/sep/04/blog-posting/website-exaggerates-old-news-report-state-departme/

Yes, Donald Trump did call John McCain a ‘loser’
","An article in the Atlantic about President Donald Trump’s private remarks about service members and veterans took social media by storm the moment it was published on Sept. 3. Trump aggressively pushed back, rejecting the article’s conclusion that he had, on multiple occasions, disparaged those serving in the military, particularly service members who had been wounded or killed. One of the claims in the article, which is based on anonymous sources, was about Trump’s private remarks about the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Trump and the 2008 Republican presidential nominee often tangled, including over McCain’s pivotal vote against a bill that would have overturned much of the Affordable Care Act. The article by Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg reads: ""Trump remained fixated on McCain, one of the few prominent Republicans to continue criticizing him after he won the nomination. When McCain died, in August 2018, Trump told his senior staff, according to three sources with direct knowledge of this event, ‘We’re not going to support that loser’s funeral,’ and he became furious, according to witnesses, when he saw flags lowered to half-staff. ‘What the f--- are we doing that for? Guy was a f---ing loser,’ the president told aides."" After the article was published, Trump took to Twitter to reject its reporting, including what he said about McCain. Over three linked tweets, Trump wrote,  ""I was never a big fan of John McCain, disagreed with him on many things including ridiculous endless wars and the lack of success he had in dealing with the VA and our great Vets, but the lowering of our Nations American Flags, and the first class funeral he was given by our Country, had to be approved by me, as President, & I did so without hesitation or complaint. Quite the contrary, I felt it was well deserved. I even sent Air Force One to bring his body, in casket, from Arizona to Washington. It was my honor to do so. Also, I never called John a loser and swear on whatever, or whoever, I was asked to swear on, that I never called our great fallen soldiers anything other than HEROES. This is more made up Fake News given by disgusting & jealous failures in a disgraceful attempt to influence the 2020 Election!"" ....John a loser and swear on whatever, or whoever, I was asked to swear on, that I never called our great fallen soldiers anything other than HEROES. This is more made up Fake News given by disgusting & jealous failures in a disgraceful attempt to influence the 2020 Election! Here, we’ll focus on Trump’s assertion that he ""never called (McCain) a loser."" The reality is that Trump did say that about McCain in a widely noted public event in 2015.  The event in question was a family leadership summit in Ames, Iowa, on July 18, 2015. Here’s the full video, with the remarks in question coming at about the 5:10 mark. After Trump recalled McCain saying something that Trump considered an insult to him and his supporters, ""I said, 'Somebody should run against McCain,' who has been, in my opinion, not so hot. And I supported him for president! I raised a million dollars for him. That's a lot of money! I supported him. He lost. He let us down. But he lost. So I never liked him much after that, because I don't like losers."" Amid audience laughter, the moderator, Republican pollster Frank Luntz, then interjected, ""But he's a war hero!"" Trump responded, ""He’s not a war hero. He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured."" Later that day, Trump retweeted, with seeming approval, a web post headlined ""Donald Trump: John McCain Is ‘A Loser,’"" that recapped his exchange at the summit. Via @fitsnews: “Donald Trump: John McCain Is ‘A Loser’” http://t.co/sgiETvdUqi Neither the White House nor Trump’s campaign responded to an inquiry for this article. Trump tweeted, ""I never called John (McCain) a loser."" That’s false. He called McCain a loser at a televised event in 2015 and then, later that day, tweeted out a web post recapping the event.

Taxpayers did not pay $120,000 for Pelosi’s hair appointment
","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi found herself in a hairy situation this week. On Sept. 1, Fox News released security footage of Pelosi at a hair salon in San Francisco, her hometown. In the video, the speaker walks across the salon with wet hair and what appears to be a mask around her neck. After the video aired, Pelosi faced backlash for getting a wash and blow-out amid ongoing coronavirus restrictions in San Francisco. Pelosi said the stylist at eSalon, where she has gone several times, told her she could visit on Aug. 31 within local guidelines — but the city prohibited non-essential businesses like salons from operating at the time. There are conflicting reports as to whether the owner of the salon OK’ed the appointment, but she called it a ""slap in the face"" for Pelosi to get her hair done while others couldn’t. Pelosi said it was a politically motivated ""setup"" and called for the salon to apologize. President Donald Trump weighed in on Twitter. Wash, rinse, repeat. The incident inspired a slew of stories on Facebook about Pelosi’s hair, but one widely shared post didn’t take issue with the speaker breaking San Francisco’s coronavirus rules. Instead, it criticized the purported cost of her travel to the salon. ""It cost taxpayers $120,000 to fly Nancy to get her hair done,"" the Sept. 1 post says. ""Plus ground travel and protection. That’s what should be in the news."" This post, shared thousands of times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We reached out to the original poster for evidence, but we haven’t heard back. Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, told us it ""cost nothing"" for the speaker to go to her hair appointment. ""She didn’t fly to get her hair done. She was already there,"" Hammill said. ""It was not a trip for the sole purpose of the hair appointment."" The Facebook post plays into a long-debunked claim that Pelosi flies to and from her home in San Francisco at great expense to taxpayers. During her first stint as speaker, Pelosi did have access to a 12-seat Gulfstream V due to security precautions put in place after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. But she has routinely flown on commercial airlines since 2011 and has been spotted in coach. In 2010, we also debunked claims of Pelosi raking up a $100,000 bar tab on her plane rides. Each member of Congress receives a budget called the Members’ Representational Allowance, which covers ""official office expenses"" including ""travel between a member’s district or state and Washington, D.C."" Members who live in districts far from Washington, such as Pelosi, get a little more than members who live closer to the capital.

Fact-checking Joe Biden's claim that Donald Trump’s payroll tax 'plan' sinks Social Security
","A new Joe Biden ad paints a bleak picture for Social Security under President Donald Trump. Here’s the full text from the ad: ""The chief actuary of the Social Security Administration just released an analysis of Trump's planned cuts to Social Security. Under Trump's plan, Social Security would become permanently depleted by the middle of calendar year 2023. If Trump gets his way, Social Security benefits will run out in just three years from now. Don't let it happen. Joe Biden will protect Social Security."" The key claim is ""if Trump gets his way, Social Security benefits will run out in just three years."" Biden is going further than what Trump has described. The tricky part is knowing what Trump wants to do. He has said two things that are at odds: he wants to protect Social Security, and he would do away with the payroll tax that keeps Social Security going. Trump’s ""way,"" as of now, is for Congress to fill in the gap so that Social Security remains funded. But there is no clear plan. To dissect this ad, let’s start with what Social Security’s chief actuary said about a ""hypothetical"" plan. Sens. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., asked the Social Security Administration what would happen if on Jan.1, 2021, the payroll tax went to zero with no other changes in the law.  The Social Security portion of the tax is 12.4% of payroll, split equally between workers and employers, or paid fully by the self-employed. The money goes into the program’s Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. Nixing it would put a hole in the 2021 Social Security budget of $1.03 trillion, chief actuary Stephen Goss said in his letter to the senators. That would be over 90% of the program’s revenues.  But the program would continue to pay benefits, drawing down its trust fund. ""We estimate that Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund reserves would become permanently depleted by the middle of calendar year 2023,"" Goss wrote. Goss said that without any change in the law, the program’s hands would be tied. Congress sets benefits, the Social Security Administration must pay them, and it can’t borrow to cover a shortfall. ""Under this hypothetical legislation, benefit obligations could not be met after the depletion of the asset reserves and elimination of payroll taxes,"" he wrote. In his letter, Goss used the term ""hypothetical legislation"" nine times. And he noted that ""I am not aware that anyone has proposed the hypothetical legislation you describe."" So, there is no plan. But Trump has targeted the payroll tax without a clear path to replacing it. The challenge of understanding Trump’s words on the payroll tax is that, aside from the temporary deferral of taxes, they are untethered to a clear plan.  For the most part, there’s been a pattern of Trump saying he would end the payroll tax and his top advisors saying he didn’t mean it. It started Aug. 8 when Trump unveiled a four-month payroll tax holiday that would last from September through December, an effort to provide financial relief during the coronavirus pandemic. ""If I win, I may extend and terminate,"" Trump said. ""In other words, I’ll extend it beyond the end of the year and terminate the tax."" Since the tax holiday covered only the worker portion of 6.2%, Trump’s words could have meant either ending the entire tax, or just the worker’s portion. The next day, White House economic chief Larry Kudlow told CNN Trump’s plan was limited to forgiving the four months of deferred tax dollars. The one clear policy was that the administration wanted Congress to backfill the lost revenues from the tax holiday — currently estimated at about $80 billion — with money from general revenues. But Trump went on to repeat that he planned to ""terminate the tax"" beyond December in press briefings on Aug. 10 and Aug. 12. Pressed to explain how he would pay for Social Security without the payroll tax, Trump was vague. Trump: ""We’re taking it out of the General Fund. And what we’ll do —"" Reporter: ""But that would incur huge deficits."" Trump: ""Yeah, what we’ll be doing is, if we do that, we’ll get it approved, in that case, by Congress. And we’ll take the money from other places, other than — we will not take it from Social Security in any way shape or form."" Reporter: ""How do you fund it from the General Fund, when the General Fund just incurred a debt of $2.8 trillion?""  Trump: ""You’re right, but we’re going to have tremendous growth."" When Fox News asked him about his plan Aug. 23, Trump said, ""It will have no impact on Social Security. We're taking it out of the general fund. It comes out of the general fund. If anything happens, we would replace it immediately."" In his acceptance speech, Trump never mentioned the payroll tax and referred to Social Security one time, saying, ""We will protect Medicare and Social Security."" The Trump campaign said that there is no plan to eliminate the payroll tax, and, with Trump’s commitment to preserving Social Security through general revenues, the program’s trust fund would not run out of money. The Biden ad said, ""If Trump gets his way, Social Security benefits will run out in just three years from now."" The Social Security chief actuary did say that if the Social Security portion of the payroll tax were eliminated, the program would run out of money in three years. Absent any response by Congress, the program would be unable to pay benefits. But the chief actuary also said he was unaware that anyone planned to end the payroll tax. The Trump campaign says there is no plan to do so. Trump has said he wants to terminate the tax. That would put the program under great financial stress. But Trump said he would look to Congress to maintain the program and draw on general revenues — potentially in excess of $1 trillion a year — to replenish any lost funds.  Overall, Trump’s comments suggest he wants a fully funded Social Security program, but he doesn’t want the taxes that pay for it. This is contradictory, but it doesn’t mean he wants Social Security to run out of money in three years.  We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/sep/04/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-donald-trumps-plan-get-rid-payroll-/

Ted Cruz’s misleading attack on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over anti-Semitism
","Two high-profile members of Congress — Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. — were engaged in a Twitter spat in January over blame for the Capitol riots when the topic of their exchange veered to their records on condemning anti-Semitism. At one point in the dialogue, Ocasio-Cortez said of the Capitol rioters, ""They wore Auschwitz shirts, erected gallows, and tried to hang the Vice President. Your continued excusal and denial of Wednesday’s Neo-Nazi presence is abhorrent and dangerous. The most healing and unifying thing *you* can do is take responsibility for your actions and resign."" Cruz responded, ""Epic hypocrisy. Facts: 1) Nazis are evil bigots. 2) You & your anti-Israel pals blocked a resolution condemning anti-Semitism — which I passed unanimously in the Senate. 3) Unless they are genocidal, calling your political opponents Nazis is atrocious."" Epic hypocrisy. Facts:1) Nazis are evil bigots.2) You & your anti-Israel pals blocked a resolution condemning antisemitism—which I passed unanimously in the Senate. https://t.co/kYQGO4zVVU3) Unless they are genocidal, calling your political opponents Nazis is atrocious. https://t.co/ZV5dhUDRzD The two continued to trade attacks over the handling of the resolutions, with Ocasio-Cortez accusing Cruz of lying and Cruz doubling down on his claim. So what did happen with the Senate and House resolutions condemning anti-Semitism? There’s a lot to consider here, but for this fact-check, we focused on the question of whether Ocasio-Cortez and her allies ""blocked a resolution condemning anti-Semitism"" that Cruz ""passed unanimously in the Senate."" And we found Cruz’s version of events leaves out a lot of important context. Their continuing Twitter thread shed light on the crux of their dispute. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, ""@tedcruz again, you are lying. Pull the Clerk record. I proudly voted for the resolution against antisemitism you cite. Your statements are growing increasingly erratic and unfounded in fact."" Cruz fired back, ""Not true. The ‘record’ you cite is the show vote on the watered-down House resolution AFTER you BLOCKED the resolution condemning antisemitism."" Anti-Semitism flared as an issue in Congress in March 2019, when Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. — a member of the ""Squad"" of left-leaning Democrats that includes Ocasio-Cortez — suggested that some lawmakers ""push for allegiance to a foreign country,"" specifically Israel. Some said this played into longstanding anti-Semitic tropes that suggest that Jews have dual loyalties and can’t be trusted to be fully American. Omar’s remark came during a panel discussion with a third Squad member, Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Omar and Tlaib are both Muslim. In response, House Democrats circulated a draft resolution titled ""Rejecting anti-Semitism as hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States."" The draft’s singular focus on anti-Semitism worried some Democratic lawmakers, including Ocasio-Cortez, who argued that the House ought to condemn other forms of bigotry as well.  ""It’s not my position to tell people how to feel, or that their hurt is invalid,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on March 5, 2019. ""But incidents like these do beg the question: where are the resolutions against homophobic statements? For anti-blackness? For xenophobia? For a member saying he’ll ""send Obama home to Kenya?"" As a result of the pushback by Ocasio-Cortez and her allies, the resolution ultimately voted on by the House on March 7, 2019, H. Res. 183, was broadened to include more than just anti-Semitism.  The resolution said the House condemned anti-Semitism as well as anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against minorities ""as hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values and aspirations that define the people of the United States.""   The resolution included roughly 30 uses of the words ""Jews,"" ""Jewish,"" or ""anti-Semitism,"" so it remained heavily critical of anti-Jewish sentiments and acts. It also criticized ""white supremacists"" for exploiting ""bigotry and weaponiz(ing) hate for political gain, targeting traditionally persecuted peoples, including African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other people of color, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, the LGBTQ community, immigrants, and others with verbal attacks, incitement, and violence."" The resolution passed in the House, 407-23, with Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Tlaib all voting in favor. The only votes against it were by Republicans. Three months after the House action, Cruz and Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., led a bipartisan effort to pass a resolution condemning anti-Semitism. Cruz was the primary sponsor. The ""sense of the Senate"" resolution, S. Res. 189, said in part that the Senate ""condemns and commits to combatting all forms of anti-Semitism."" In a speech on the Senate floor, Cruz said the resolution ""speaks to prejudices Jews experience which we must acknowledge."" Afterward, he asked that the resolution be passed by unanimous consent. Since no senator objected, the resolution was deemed to be passed unanimously.  Unlike the House resolution, the Senate resolution exclusively addressed anti-Semitism. However, on the subject of anti-Semitism, the text of the two resolutions was similar. For instance, the Senate resolution said that ""in the United States, Jews have faced, and continue to face, false accusations of divided loyalty between the United States and Israel,"" while the House resolution said it ""rejects the perpetuation of anti-Semitic stereotypes in the United States and around the world, including the pernicious myth of dual loyalty and foreign allegiance, especially in the context of support for the United States-Israel alliance."" The two resolutions also denounced hate crimes targeting Jews.  Cruz said that Ocasio-Cortez and her allies ""blocked a resolution condemning anti-Semitism — which I passed unanimously in the Senate.""  Cruz sponsored a Senate resolution  against anti-Semitism that passed by unanimous consent. But his claim that Ocasio-Cortez’ blocked a similar House resolution leaves out important context.  Ocasio-Cortez opposed the initial resolution draft as being too narrow. Once condemnations of other types of bigotry were added to the text, the resolution went forward and passed easily, including a vote in favor by Ocasio-Cortez. Both resolutions had similar language on anti-Semitism. We rate Cruz’s statement Mostly False.

Joe Biden exaggerates support among economists for his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan
","President Joe Biden has made beating the coronavirus and repairing the economic damage it unleashed his defining priorities. The central pillar of his strategy is a $1.9 trillion recovery plan. At a CNN town hall in Milwaukee, host Anderson Cooper asked Biden if he was committed to passing a $1.9 trillion bill, or if the number was up for negotiation. Biden responded as though there was no need for discussion. He said support for his package came from ""economists left, right and center."" ""The overwhelming consensus is: In order to grow the economy a year or two, three, and four down the line, we can’t spend too much,"" Biden said Feb. 16. ""Now is the time we should be spending. Now is the time to go big."" Economists across the political spectrum have indeed embraced delivering substantial relief, but when it comes to the total price tag, there’s more debate than he describes. Including among Democrats. In early February, former Obama administration Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers voiced concerns. In a Washington Post op-ed, Summers warned that while the bill had to be big, there was a risk of overshoot. Spending too much on COVID-19, Summers said, would squeeze out money for other big plans, from infrastructure to renewable energy to preschool. ""After resolving the coronavirus crisis, how will political and economic space be found for the public investments that should be the nation’s highest priority?"" Summers wrote. Summers was not alone. The former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, Olivier Blanchard, said $1.9 trillion was ""too much."" Blanchard agreed with the plan’s main goals — spending on vaccines and health care, protecting the people who lost jobs and boosting demand. But Blanchard didn’t reach Biden’s total. ""When you make the sum of all these needs, which are real and have to be satisfied, you don't get to $1.9 trillion. You get to a smaller number,"" Blanchard said Feb. 8. Blanchard’s ballpark number was $1 trillion. Desmond Lachman, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a market-oriented think tank, agreed that there is consensus across the ideological spectrum in favor of additional economic stimulus. The supporters include Lachman’s onetime colleague at the institute Kevin Hassett, who joined the Trump administration as the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. Hassett told CNN that he broadly supports Biden’s $1.9 trillion package. But Lachman said there’s uneven support for that level of spending. ""There are many economists who think that a package as large as a $1.9 trillion package is inviting trouble,"" Lachman said. Lachman, like the other more cautious economists, worries about overheating the economy with too much cash. The resulting inflation would lead to higher interest rates, which, Lachman argues, would send world financial markets into a tailspin.  Ever eager to foster stability, the U.S. Federal Reserve offered calming words on that front. Chairman Jerome Powell said Feb. 10 that if a burst of spending drives prices up, he doesn’t think it would last, nor would it automatically trigger a rate increase. A recent survey puts some numbers to the range of opinions among economists. In January, the Wall Street Journal asked over 60 economists how much stimulus is needed. A bit more than half said less than $1 trillion would do. Just under half preferred an amount between $1 trillion and $2 trillion.  Now, this was strictly a question about economic stimulus. Biden’s plan includes about $160 billion for coronavirus programs, and other pieces might come under the same umbrella. But at some top-line level, economists disagree over the size of the proposal. Jason Furman, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, suggested making the Biden plan more flexible. If economic growth remained weak after some initial stimulus, Furman would extend the aid for a longer time. If not, the government could dial back its spending. ""These provisions could also phase out aid more quickly than Mr. Biden proposes if the economy rebounds faster than expected,"" Furman wrote Jan. 25, 2021. Samuel Hammond with the Niskanen Center, a group named after an economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan, joined over 120 economists in a letter that called for ""substantial"" relief. But Hammond said he agrees with the concerns raised by Summers, and has reservations about a major part of the Biden plan: $350 billion for state and local governments. ""I think Larry (Summers) has been making some decent points about COVID relief, and the longer-term benefits of prioritizing public investments rather than a ton of state and local fiscal aid,"" Hammond said. The White House press office staff noted that support has come from top Democratic and Republican economists, and they pointed to statements from leading business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable. But while those statements push for strong action, they are not specific about a dollar figure. ""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on the details and in ensuring that any additional economic assistance is timely, targeted, and temporary, "" the Chamber of Commerce said Jan. 14. That leaves plenty of room for discussion about the scale of the relief package. Biden said that economists across the political spectrum supported his COVID-19 relief proposal. There is broad agreement that Washington should spend hundreds of billions of dollars to corral the coronavirus, help small businesses and give assistance to the millions of people who lost their jobs. But Biden treated that support as an endorsement of his entire $1.9 trillion plan. Many prominent economists have concerns about the price tag, which was the exact focus of the question Biden was answering.  He glossed over that debate.

Do Biden’s executive orders have any effect on US energy independence?
","During his first eight days in office, President Joe Biden issued  executive orders that would curtail the production and transportation of oil, sparking a backlash from supporters of former President Donald Trump. Musician Ted Nugent was among thousands of people on Facebook who shared an image that alluded to Trump’s tenure and indirectly attacked Biden. It stated: ""The United States was energy independent in 2019 for the first time since 1957. In just 10 days we are sent back 50 years.""  Nugent shared the post with an insult directed at Biden. The image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We looked at both parts of the claim: whether the U.S. was energy independent in 2019, and whether Biden’s early executive orders changed that status.  The claim relies on one common measure of energy independence: whether a country produces more energy than it consumes. By that measure, the U.S. achieved independence in 2019 for the full year, and stayed that way through last year.  If consumption were ultimately to top production for the year again, that would take the U.S. back to where it was in 2018, not 1957, and not back 50 years. But the government hasn’t published full-year data yet for 2020, or any results for 2021. So there’s no evidence yet that the U.S. situation changed since Biden took office. As for two executive orders issued by Biden on energy, they don’t affect current U.S. production levels, and it’s unclear whether they’ll have a long-term effect on U.S. energy independence. We checked a similar claim that Biden’s actions ""ended energy independence for the United States"" and found it speculative at best. In 2019, U.S. energy production exceeded U.S. energy consumption on an annual basis for the first time since 1957, according to the Energy Information Administration.  That includes petroleum and natural gas, which together accounted for 66% of total production in 2019, as well as coal, renewable energy and nuclear electric power. Production of crude oil and natural gas reached record highs in 2019, the federal agency said. U.S. energy producers scaled back in 2020 in response to the pandemic. But consumption fell even faster amid the recession. So for the first 10 months of 2020, the latest period for which composite data are available, energy production still exceeded consumption. The EIA says trends for this year will depend on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and the speed of the U.S. economic recovery. In January, it forecast further declines in U.S. oil and natural gas in coming months as producers seek to prevent oversupplies that could hurt prices. Some experts prefer a stricter definition of energy independence: total disengagement from the global energy market, or zero imports.  ""By that standard, energy independence for the U.S. would be practically unattainable for the foreseeable future,"" said Stacey Morris, director of research at Alerian, which tracks energy and other investment markets. In 2019, as production surged, the U.S. exported more energy than it imported, according to the Energy Information Administration, and remained a net energy exporter through the first 10 months of 2020. Previously, the U.S. had been a net energy importer since 1952.  But the U.S. is still one of the world’s largest energy importers, according to the EIA. For example, it imported about 9.1 million barrels of petroleum per day in 2019 from about 90 countries. That’s the lowest level of total petroleum imports since 1996, but the U.S. still uses imports to help supply domestic and international markets, according to the EIA. Regions such as the Pacific Northwest rely on imports from Canada year-round, and the U.S. still relies on imports from Canada in the winter to meet heating demand, said S&P Global Platts Analytics, an energy analytics firm. Biden’s Jan. 20 executive order blocked construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and put a moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.  The suspension of the Keystone XL, which would have helped carry Canadian oil to U.S. refineries on the Gulf coast, means the U.S. will seek more crude oil from areas such as the Middle East rather than Canada. But it doesn’t affect U.S. production, Morris said. A decades-long push to drill for oil in the Alaskan refuge ended in January with a lease sale in which half of the offered leases drew no bids — evidence that oil companies had little interest in drilling there. No current production was affected.  Biden’s Jan. 27 order paused new federal oil drilling leases on public lands or in offshore waters until a review on federal oil and gas leasing policy is done. That order has no immediate effect on ongoing production either, and many producers have stockpiled permits in anticipation of regulations around activity on federal lands, Morris said.  ""Over a longer time horizon, a ban of new leases on federal lands or limiting permits could have negative implications for U.S. production and ultimately require oil imports to replace lost production, making the U.S. less energy independent,"" she said.  ""This has not happened at this point,"" she said. For it to happen ""would probably require more from a policy standpoint than the current pause on leases."" An image widely shared on Facebook claimed: ""The United States was energy independent in 2019 for the first time since 1957. In just 10 days we are sent back 50 years."" In 2019, U.S. energy production exceeded consumption on an annual basis for the first time since 1957. That’s one definition of energy independence. Through the first 10 months of 2020, the latest period for which data are available, energy production was down from a year earlier, but still exceeded consumption. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to import millions of barrels of petroleum per day. The claim that Biden’s orders reversed the trend or the gains in U.S. energy independence is not supported. The government hasn’t published full-year data for 2020, or for the period since Biden took office.  The orders didn’t stop any current production, and any new production from the avenues he closed off would have taken years to materialize.  The image contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Biden would move some ag funds to climate change, but he’d still pay farmers
","Is President Joe Biden taking $30 billion that former President Donald Trump intended for farmers and using it for climate change instead? That’s the claim of a widely shared image on Facebook. Alongside a photo of Biden, it states: ""Biden will redirect the $30B — that Trump left for U.S. farmers — to ‘climate change.’""   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The $30 billion fund was created in 1933 to support agriculture broadly; it wasn’t something left behind by Trump. Trump used it to pay farmers who suffered from retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and other U.S. trading partners. Biden would use at least some of it to pursue climate change goals, but that money would still go to farmers.  The $30 billion reference is to the Commodity Credit Corp., a government corporation created in 1933 with an executive order by President Franklin Roosevelt. Overseen by the Agriculture Department, the corporation has borrowing authority of $30 billion at any one time from the U.S. Treasury to broadly support the agriculture industry. Annual appropriations from Congress replenish its borrowing authority. The Trump Administration used CCC’s authority to respond to retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and other trading partners on U.S. agricultural exports. That included authorizing up to $12 billion in payments to farmers in 2018 and up to $16 billion in 2019. But CCC funds are not something that Trump could reserve; and its funds are not strictly for farmers.  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the funds can be directed to programs that include ""commodity and income support, natural resources conservation, export promotion, international food aid, disaster assistance, agricultural research and bioenergy development."" The Agriculture Department told us the CCC currently has a balance of about $17.8 billion in borrowing authority. Biden’s nominee for agriculture secretary is Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor and the secretary of agriculture during the Obama administration. Vilsack said during his Senate confirmation hearing Feb. 2 that the administration wants to use CCC funds to create a carbon bank. It would be used to pay producers for practices that capture carbon in soil. He said the fund could provide incentives to reduce tillage of soil that can release carbon into the atmosphere, and keep vegetation growing on fields longer so that it can withdraw more carbon from the atmosphere. But no plan is in place and there is some question about whether Biden would need legislation to use the fund toward climate initiatives.  It’s also not clear how much of the fund would be used toward climate change versus other initiatives.  In his stimulus plan, Biden identified the fund as a potential source of economic relief for restaurants and bars, as many have suffered financially during the pandemic. An image widely shared on Facebook claimed that Biden ""will redirect the $30 billion"" that Trump ""left for U.S. farmers to ‘climate change.’"" This is a false choice. Biden’s nominee for agriculture secretary has said the administration wants to tap a $30 billion fund that’s available for supporting agriculture broadly to pay farmers to use farming practices that meet climate change goals. It wasn’t started by Trump. But no plan has been announced, and Biden has indicated he also wants to tap the fund for other purposes, such as helping restaurants that have suffered financially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

How are the CDC, North Carolina treating Type 1 diabetes in the vaccine rollout?
","A billboard in Johnston County suggests North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper is shortchanging people with type 1 diabetes. A WRAL viewer emailed a photo of the billboard on U.S. Highway 301 to PolitiFact. It says: ""Gov Roy Cooper does not consider Type 1 diabetes an under lying health issue! Think about that!"" The billboard does not show who paid for it. Warren Stancil, the president of the billboard company, InterState Outdoor Inc., said he doesn’t know the buyer’s identity. ""This was an anonymous person who bought the ad space. All I know is what’s in the message,"" Stancil said in an email. The ad went up around Jan. 22, he said. Given the timing of the message in the midst of a vaccine rollout, we’re assuming for the purposes of this check that the messenger is likely referring to where diabetics fall in North Carolina’s inoculation schedule. The billboard’s message touches on a controversial subject. To date, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not consider both types of diabetes to carry the same level of risk for COVID-19 complications. In North Carolina, meanwhile, the health department has grouped Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes together and people with either condition qualify for covid vaccines in Group 4, ahead of the general population. The CDC’s webpage about how the virus affects people with medical conditions says people with Type 2 diabetes are at increased risk, while people with Type 1 diabetes ""might"" be at increased risk. Under current CDC recommendations, people with Type 1 diabetes would be vaccinated with the general population. Advocacy groups such as the American Diabetes Association and JDRF (formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) are lobbying the CDC to place higher priority on people with Type 1 diabetes.  A study published in December found that Type 1 diabetes ""independently increases the adverse impacts of COVID-19,"" while another recent study found that Black COVID-19 patients were more likely to develop a serious complication of Type 1 diabetes than white patients. Still, JDRF spokeswoman Cynthia Rice said that, as a result of the CDC’s recommendations, ""many states"" haven’t prioritized people with Type 1 diabetes. So the American Diabetes Association has been contacting governors and state agencies across the country, spokeswoman Daisy Diaz told PolitiFact. In North Carolina, the health department currently considers both types of diabetes to be ""chronic conditions."" Where does that put diabetics in North Carolina’s vaccine rollout? Let’s say someone has diabetes but isn’t over age 65, doesn’t work in an essential industry and doesn’t meet any other criteria for moving up North Carolina’s vaccine priority list. That person would be in Group 4 of the state’s five groups: Group 1: Healthcare workers, long-term care staff and residents Group 2: Older adults Group 3: Frontline essential workers Group 4: Adults at increased risk of severe illness Group 5: Everyone else Asked about North Carolina’s plan, Rice said: ""That is the policy we are seeking around the country, with Type 1 included with other disease that increase risk of severe illness from COVID."" While people with both types of diabetes are prioritized in North Carolina, old versions of the health department’s website may have given people the wrong impression. Take for example the department’s FAQ page about COVID-19 vaccines. Under the ""getting vaccinated"" section, the department lists chronic conditions that make someone a higher priority for vaccination. The page currently lists both types of diabetes as chronic conditions. However, according to an internet archive, the page excluded Type 1 diabetes from its list of chronic conditions as recently as Feb. 12. The webpage quoted CDC guidance, mentioning only Type 2 diabetes as a chronic condition. That exclusion may be why some media outlets have mentioned only Type 2 diabetes when reporting on North Carolina’s rollout. North Carolina has tried to follow most CDC recommendations, said SarahLewis Peel, a spokeswoman for the health department. However, Peel said, North Carolina has always intended to prioritize all diabetics for vaccines.  People with both types of diabetes have been prioritized together since the state released its guidance for Group 4 on Jan. 25, she said. The billboard says ""Cooper does not consider Type 1 diabetes an (underlying) health issue!"" North Carolina’s vaccine rollout prioritizes people with type 1 diabetes ahead of the general population. So it’s clear that Cooper, to some degree, considers the disease to be an underlying health issue.

Popular TikTok posts mislead on details of anti-transgender bills
","In a video seen by tens of thousands of people, someone sketches in pencil as a computerized voice speaks over a recording of the song ""Michelle"" by the indie band Sir Chloe. ""This is f---ing disgusting,"" the voice says. ""Schools are trying to make a law that teachers can see girls' private parts to make sure they're not trans."" The sound in the clip has been used in more than 13,000 other posts on the video-sharing platform TikTok, which is popular with teenagers and young adults.  The posts came days after President Joe Biden signed an executive order that said Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, a federal civil rights law, prevents discrimination based on sex and gender identity. ""Every person should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear, no matter who they are or whom they love,"" the order says. ""Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports."" While the order itself did not change policies for public school districts, it signaled a departure from the Trump administration’s position that schools may exclude students from athletic teams based on their identities. In response, several state legislatures introduced bills that would prohibit transgender students from being part of teams that don’t match their sex assigned at birth. (Screenshot from TikTok) The viral TikTok posts contain a hint of truth about this legislation, but their primary claim is misleading. Congress and state legislatures — not schools — have introduced bills targeting transgender student-athletes. None of the pending legislation would force teachers to examine students’ genitalia. Some bills would open up the possibility for doctors to examine students before they can participate in sports. Lawmakers in at least 17 states are considering legislation that would limit opportunities for transgender student-athletes, according to a tally from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy organization.  Cathryn Oakley, state legislative director and senior counsel for the HRC, has been tracking those bills. She said the TikTok posts leave out some key details. ""None of them require a teacher to do a physical examination for a student,"" Oakley said. ""However, several of them would require that a student would undergo a physical examination by a doctor — and that doctor would have to attest that they've done a variety of different things. In some of the states, it’s really invasive, gruesome testing."" As an example, Oakley pointed to a passed Idaho law that banned transgender women and girls from participating in women’s sports. (The law is currently not being enforced as it undergoes a legal challenge.)  ""If disputed, a student may establish sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex based solely on: (a) The student's internal and external reproductive anatomy; (b) The student's normal endogenously produced levels of testosterone; and (c) An analysis of the student's genetic makeup,"" the March 2020 law said. In an April 2020 lawsuit, the American Civil Liberties Union argued that the Idaho law ""discriminates on the basis of sex and transgender status"" and the doctor’s examinations would ""intrude upon the privacy and bodily autonomy of all women and girls engaged in student athletics."" The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Lindsay Hecox, a transgender woman who wanted to run cross-country at Boise State University. In August, a federal judge blocked the law, saying the ACLU was ""likely to succeed in establishing the Act is unconstitutional as currently written."" The law now awaits legal review in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Meanwhile, several other states — including neighboring Montana and Utah — are trying to pass their own versions of the Idaho law. RELATED: Biden signs executive order banning discrimination against transgender service members And in Congress, Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., recently reintroduced a bill that would require schools to interpret Title IX to recognize student-athletes based on their sex assigned at birth. ""The bill does not say anything about physical exams — it is based on what was determined at birth,"" said Carson Steelman, Steube’s communications director. ""Genetics at birth is shown on an original birth certificate."" (Some states, however, allow transgender individuals to change the sex listed on their birth certificate.) While some proposals, including legislation in Iowa and Georgia, contain specific provisions about doctors’ exams, we could find no evidence that lawmakers are pushing for teachers to examine transgender students. Utah state Rep. Kera Birkeland, a Republican, said ""the physical required for sports participation will not change at all"" under her bill. Several TikTok posts say ""schools are trying to make a law that teachers can see girls' private parts to make sure they're not trans."" That claim is a misunderstanding of how some states are trying to legislate against transgender students. Congress and at least 17 states are considering legislation that would prohibit transgender students from being part of teams that don’t match their sex assigned at birth. Some of those bills would require doctor’s exams, but none of them say teachers would examine students’ genitalia. The TikTok posts contain an element of truth about legislation that could compel the examination of transgender students. But the posts ignore critical facts that would give a different impression about how that legislation would be implemented.

Tucker Carlson falsely blames Green New Deal, wind energy for Texas power outage
","More than 4 million Texans were forced to bear single-digit temperatures without heat or power this week when a polar vortex crippled the state’s energy system.  On Feb. 16, Fox News host Tucker Carlson placed the blame for the outage on renewable energy, paying particular attention to frozen windmills.  ""Unbeknownst to most people, the Green New Deal came to Texas, the power grid in the state became totally reliant on windmills. Then it got cold and the windmills broke, because that’s what happens in the Green New Deal,"" said Carlson during his self-titled primetime show.   “totally reliant on windmills” pic.twitter.com/xIfQPg0IlB The Green New Deal is a proposed House resolution that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., introduced in 2019. Broadly, the bill seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address problems like economic inequality and racial injustice. However, the bill didn’t pass the House; if it did, it would have been a non-binding resolution without the power of law.  PolitiFact reached out to several experts with knowledge of the Texas energy system. All of them strongly pushed back on Carlson’s assertions that renewable energy played a central role in the outage.  ""The claim is devoid of facts and removed from reality,"" said Samuel Newell, an electricity expert at the Brattle Group, which has run detailed analyses of the Texas power grid.  Fox News didn’t respond to a request for comment.     RELATED: Natural gas, not wind turbines, main driver of Texas power shortage Nearly half of the state’s wind turbine capacity went offline during the cold weather because the turbines weren’t built to operate in freezing temperatures like those in other states. But Texas’ largest source of electric power, gas-fired plants, also cratered in the extreme cold, along with coal-fired plants. Everything from frozen gas supply lines to frozen control instruments pushed down generating capacity.  ""The idea that wind is responsible for these outages is actually just absurd,"" said Michael Webber, a mechanical engineering professor at UT Austin. ""It doesn’t match the facts on the ground, and it’s not what any energy expert would say."" During a Feb. 16 call with reporters, Dan Woodfin, a senior director at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages more than 90% of the state’s electric load, said most of the problem was with the gas-fired plants. ""It appears that a lot of the generation that has gone offline today has been primarily due to issues on the natural gas system,"" he said.  In fact, wind energy accounts for 10% of ERCOT’s winter power-generating capacity, said Daniel Cohan, an environmental engineering professor at Rice University. The rest depends primarily on thermal sources like natural gas, coal and nuclear.  As Webber put it, Texas is ""in a gas-dominated energy system.""  During the outage, all sources of power generation in Texas were operating beneath normal levels, including wind. However, Webber said, ""the level of failure of the gas system is pretty spectacular."" Newell agreed with Webber, saying that the primary problem is that thermal power plants were not built to withstand the cold. They began to go offline just as freezing temperatures boosted the demand for heating, causing ERCOT to impose rolling blackouts.  On Feb. 16, demand for power skyrocketed nearly 17 gigawatts past normal levels, while thermal generators lost more than 20 gigawatts of power, Newell said. By contrast, wind power output during daily energy peaks was about 2 gigawatts below the 7 gigawatts expected.  ""Compared to the loss of thermal power, wind is a sideshow here,"" he told PolitiFact.  In relative terms, the loss of power caused by malfunctions at thermal power plants was about five or six times larger than the loss caused by frozen wind turbines.  Carlson said, ""Unbeknownst to most people, the Green New Deal came to Texas, the power grid in the state became totally reliant on windmills."" This is inaccurate on several levels. Texas’ energy supply is not ""totally reliant"" on wind energy. The central cause of the outage was a massive failure of thermal energy plants combined with a surge in demand for heat and other forms of power. While renewables are in the spirit of the Green New Deal, it hasn’t been enacted in Texas, or anywhere else.

Joe Biden border wall criticism hits mark but blanket amnesty misses
","On Inauguration Day President Biden signed 16 proclamations and executive actions, including several related to immigration, the border wall and deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA).  Rep. Ashley Hinson, the Republican from Iowa’s 1st Congressional District, voiced her opposition to Biden’s immigration approach in a tweet on Jan. 23. It read: ""President Biden’s day one approach to immigration is radical— it will make our country less safe and disadvantage us economically. There’s no doubt our immigration system is broken, but blanket amnesty and halting border wall construction will take us in the wrong direction."" We’re going to focus on whether or not Biden’s presidential actions include plans to halt border wall construction and give blanket amnesty.  Hinson’s communication’s director did not respond to PolitiFact’s multiple attempts contact her. First, the wall. Biden’s ""Proclamation on the Termination Of Emergency With Respect To The Southern Border Of The United States And Redirection Of Funds Diverted To Border Wall Construction"" responds to former President Trump’s proclamation declaring a national emergency at the southern border. Biden’s order calls Trump’s declaration unwarranted and terminates it. Biden said his administration would not divert more money to the U.S.-Mexico border wall and that construction would be paused unless the Secretary of Defense or Secretary of Homeland Security made an exception. Biden’s proclamation says the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Homeland Security will assess the legality of funding and contracting methods used to build the wall and the consequences for stopping the wall’s construction.  ""Like every nation, the United States has a right and a duty to secure its borders and protect its people against threats. But building a massive wall that spans the entire southern border is not a serious policy solution,"" Biden said in the proclamation. ""It is a waste of money that diverts attention from genuine threats to our homeland security.""  However, none of Biden’s day one executive actions mentions amnesty. Moreover, a Fox News articlethat Hinson responded to in a retweet of the article does not mention blanket amnesty.  A previous fact check stated, ""The idea of ‘blanket amnesty’ suggests a formal, legal act, in which the government pardons a group for violating immigration policies and allows them to obtain permanent residency."" The executive action Biden took revoked Trump’s executive order, which restricted people from a list of countries, predominantly Musilim, from entering the United States. Biden also restored the Obama Administration’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which allowed for a two-year deferment on removing from the country immigrants who met certain criteria.  Biden favors giving legal status to people who live in the United States illegally, although they would have to clear hurdles. His executive order on the revision of civil immigiration enforcement policies and priorities revoked another Trump executive action that directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to prioritize removing immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visa. Removal was called for, especially, for those convicted of a criminal offense, charged with an offense that is not resolved, engaged in fraud, or who have abused any government program distributing public benefits, are under final order of removal but have not exited the country, of have been deemed a risk to public safety or national security by an immigration officer.  While Biden’s executive actions call for a pause of border wall construction with a goal of ending it, none of his day-one immigration related actions call for blanket amnesty. Hinson’s comment on the retweet contains an element of truth — the border wall characterization. But it adds something that is not in the Biden order or retweeted news story, giving a different impression of the order than exists in reality. That is why we rate Hinson’s statement as being Half True. ",/factchecks/2021/feb/17/ashley-hinson/joe-biden-border-wall-criticism-hits-mark-blanket-/

Fact-checking Joe Biden’s claim about people having to seek asylum ‘from abroad’
","During his first town hall since being sworn into office, President Joe Biden reaffirmed his promise to offer a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants living illegally in the country, and denounced practices that he said required people to ""seek asylum from abroad."" ""For the first time in American history, if you're seeking asylum, meaning you're being persecuted, you're seeking asylum, you can't do it from the United States,"" Biden said in Milwaukee Feb. 16. ""You used to come, have an asylum officer determine whether or not you met the criteria ... but you can't even do that. You’ve got to seek asylum from abroad."" Is Biden right that people have to seek asylum from abroad? He isn’t. In recycling a talking point from his campaign, Biden overstated the details of a program implemented by his predecessor, and failed to note that his administration has already revised it. His statement gives the wrong impression to people who aren’t very familiar with the asylum debate. The United States grants asylum to people who demonstrate that they have suffered persecution or fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. There are two ways of obtaining asylum in the United States: the defensive process or the affirmative process. For instance, people who are apprehended by Border Patrol agents and slated for removal can apply for asylum as a defense against deportation. People who apply for the affirmative process are not in removal proceedings; they could be people who have been living in the country for months and arrived either legally or illegally. Starting in 2019 during the Trump administration, people who arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border without proper documents and applied for asylum in the United States were sent to Mexico to wait there for a resolution of their case, which could take months or years. The ""Remain in Mexico"" program led to thousands of migrants setting up makeshift camps in border towns in Mexico. Immigration experts have said it was unprecedented for people to be sent out of the United States after initiating an asylum claim here. But the Trump program didn’t change a key principle of asylum law: People have to be physically present in the United States to request asylum. They can apply for asylum within one year of their arrival in the United States — whether they got here with or without authorization. Biden described the change incorrectly. Moreover, Biden’s characterization of Trump’s policy wasn’t true for the people who already live in the United States and seek asylum through the affirmative process. Biden’s remarks ignore that his administration has stopped sending asylum seekers to Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security has said that beginning Feb. 19, it plans to begin phase one of a program to allow into the United States people who were sent to Mexico under the Remain in Mexico program and who have active immigration court cases. About 25,000 people have such active cases, according to DHS. In the town hall, Biden ""was referring to the prior administration’s divisive use"" of the Remain in Mexico program, said Vedant Patel, a White House spokesperson. During his campaign for president, reporters asked Biden about the asylum seekers sent to Mexico by the Trump administration. Biden, speaking about this specific group, said it was ""the first time ever you've had to seek asylum in a third country."" We rated that claim Mostly True, given the context of the question. Experts said the Mexico program was the first of its kind, but noted that people were sent to Mexico not to seek asylum, but to wait for a decision on their U.S. case. Biden said, ""For the first time in American history, if you're seeking asylum ... you can't do it from the United States. ... You’ve got to seek asylum from abroad."" Biden misstated the facts. People can apply for asylum only once they are in the United States. During the Trump administration, some people who entered at the southern border and sought asylum in the United States were sent to Mexico to wait for a decision on their case. Biden’s administration has said it will no longer send asylum seekers to Mexico. Asylum law also extends to people who already live in the United States and are not in deportation proceedings. Even when the Remain in Mexico program was in effect, people already in the United States who applied for asylum were not necessarily sent out of the country to wait for a resolution of their case.

Michigan Senate GOP leader Shirkey falsely claims dead people voted
","Michigan’s top elected Republican relied on an oft-repeated and inaccurate claim about dead voters to bolster his argument for changes in state election law. In a Feb. 16 radio interview, state Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey  acknowledged that Biden won Michigan by over 154,000 votes, but said the state didn’t do enough to ensure election integrity. ""We do have some things that we need to address because it was a little too loose. Too many dead people voted and there was too much confusion at absentee counting boards,"" Shirkey claimed in the interview on WKHM. At the start of this year’s legislative session, Shirkey said that election integrity would be a top priority for lawmakers. Lawmakers already introduced several bills aimed at increasing penalties for absentee voting violations and removing voters with unknown birthdates from state election rolls. We asked Shirkey’s office for evidence to back his claim about dead people voting, but didn’t hear back. The Secretary of State’s office has said it is ""not aware of a single confirmed case showing that a ballot was actually cast on behalf of a deceased individual."" Claims circulating online that dead people voted in Michigan were found to be false. One such claim included a list purporting to show thousands of dead voters in Wayne County who cast ballots in the November election. The list had a number of serious flaws. It contained voters who were not Wayne County residents, as well as voters who never received an absentee ballot. It also included at least one woman who’s still alive who cast an absentee ballot. Michigan has mechanisms in place to maintain the integrity of its voter files. It is a member of the Electronic Registration Information Center, a multistate partnership that offers access to federal databases and technology that relies on Social Security Administration death records to flag deceased voters. The state also checks to ensure that absentee ballots cast by living people who die before Election Day are not counted. In the Nov. 3 election, clerks across Michigan rejected 3,469 absentee ballots cast by people who were alive when they returned their ballots but died before Election Day. Clerical errors happen. ""On rare occasions, a ballot received for a living voter may be recorded in a way that makes it appear as if the voter is dead,"" the Secretary of State’s office explains on its fact-check page. One Facebook post seized on a clerical error to falsely claim that a dead voter in Detroit cast a ballot in the November election. The voter, William Bradley, told PolitiFact that he voted absentee and shares the same name and address as his deceased father. The ballot cast by Bradley was initially logged incorrectly as belonging to his deceased father, said Daniel Baxter, a consultant for the Detroit Department of Elections. Baxter told PolitiFact that no ballot for the father ""was ever requested, received or counted."" Many Republican lawmakers have called for cleaning up outdated voter rolls to remove the names of ineligible voters who have moved out of state or died. In 66 Michigan counties, the number of people on the registered voter rolls of October 2020 was greater than the number of 18-year-olds in the county, according to census estimates. That suggests that people who moved, died or are otherwise ineligible to vote are still listed as registered voters. Former President Donald Trump pointed to these counties as part of his campaign to cast doubt on the election results. But outdated voter rolls don’t support Shirkey’s claim that dead people voted. While Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson received criticism for sending absentee ballot applications to every registered voter in Michigan, her office explained that ""applications sent to registered voters who have died do not result in a ballot being sent to the voter, because the dead voter cannot return the application with a signature, let alone one that matches the signature the clerk has on file with their voter registration.""  Shirkey claimed that ""too many dead people voted"" in the Nov. 3 general election in Michigan.  There’s no evidence to support Shirkey’s claim. The Secretary of State’s office said it’s not aware of a single confirmed case of ballots being cast behalf of a dead person. Similar claims have been debunked. The state has ways to flag deceased voters, and clerks across the state were able to successfully identify thousands of voters who submitted absentee ballots but died before Election Day.

No, Biden has not signed a 45% capital gains tax or an inheritance tax increase
","The 117th Congress has been focused on the second impeachment of former President Donald Trump and a COVID-19 relief package. It hasn’t yet approved any tax bills for President Joe Biden to sign.  Yet a post widely shared on Facebook stated: ""Biden signs 45% Capital gains tax. Kiss your inheritance goodbye."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The claim raises issues related to two different taxes that Biden has proposed changing: the capital gains tax, which is applied to the profits from sales of assets such as stocks; and the estate tax, which is applied to assets after their owner dies and can reduce the size of an inheritance.  But the proposed changes haven’t been enacted.  ""These are just campaign proposals. Nothing's been passed, nothing’s been signed,"" said Robert McClelland, a senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center. A capital gain is the difference between what someone paid for an asset, also known as the ""basis,"" and what they sold it for. The tax rates for capital gains vary based on income and how long the asset was owned. Rates are more favorable for assets that are held for more than a year, and some gains on home sales are exempt from taxes.  In the presidential campaign, Biden proposed raising the top long-term capital gains rate to 39.6% from 20%.  This increase would apply only to people earning more than $1 million per year. When it comes to inheritances, the vast majority of estates do not pay the estate tax; it kicks in only for larger estates.  The current 40% estate tax rate applies only to individual estates larger than $11.58 million, and only to the assets above that amount (the threshold is $23.16 million for married couples). That is, the first $11.58 million of an estate is exempt from federal estate taxes. The exemption is that high largely because the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubled the exemption in 2018 and indexed it to inflation after 2018. However, that provision is set to expire in 2025. After that, the exemption would revert to $5 million, unless the law is changed. Candidate Biden proposed raising the rate to 45% and reducing the exemption to $3.5 million. So, the change would affect more estates and subject them to higher taxes. Based on the estimated 2.81 million people who will die in 2022, about 2,600 estates, or 0.09%, would be taxable under current law, the Tax Policy Center estimates. If the exemption were reduced to $3.5 million, about 16,600 estates, or 0.59%, would be taxable. Biden also proposed another change that’s related to both capital gains and inheritances. It involves a current tax policy called ""stepped-up basis."" Stepped-up basis provides a big benefit to those who inherit certain assets, including real estate, that has appreciated in value over time. It resets the cost basis for an asset to its fair-market value when the owner died. So under stepped-up basis, a person who inherits an asset and then sells it for a profit has to pay a capital gains tax on its gains in value only from the date of the estate owner’s death, rather than from the time it was originally purchased. Biden proposed eliminating stepped-up basis, so that the tax would apply on the asset’s full gain in value since purchase. It’s possible any proposal might apply only to those making $400,000, in keeping with his pledge not to raise taxes on people making less than that. A widely shared Facebook post stated: ""Biden signs 45% capital gains tax. Kiss your inheritance goodbye."" Biden has proposed changes that would increase capital gains and estate tax rates, and expand the reach of both taxes.  But Congress has not passed any of those changes, and thus no such bill has been signed by Biden.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Vaccine skeptics commonly cite VAERS reports as evidence that vaccines are lethal or otherwise dangerous. But the agencies that run the tracking system warn that the reports shouldn’t be misinterpreted. Search results on the system come with this caveat: ""VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness."" Without further study, vaccine experts say, it’s not possible to tell whether a particular adverse event is linked to the vaccine or merely occurred afterward as a coincidence, and they cautioned against drawing inferences from reports published in the database.  Without that context, posts like this one risk misleading people by implying that the vaccine caused or contributed to these deaths. An adverse event is a health problem that arises after someone has received a vaccine. VAERS accepts and records any and all reports of adverse events, and the government acknowledges that ""reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable."" To illustrate the shortcomings of the database, one physician reported that a vaccine had turned him into the Incredible Hulk, the comic-book character. Both the CDC and the physician confirmed to PolitiFact that his report was initially accepted and entered into the system as an adverse event.  Since VAERS doesn’t show whether an adverse event was caused by the vaccine or occurred coincidentally, it’s generally not useful on its own for assessing whether a vaccine poses a risk to human health, said Dr. Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center in Atlanta. Instead, vaccine experts said, VAERS should be seen as a ""hypothesis-generating"" system, which helps scientists decide which negative side effects to test for. For example, in 1999, VAERS reports helped physicians realize that a rotavirus vaccine was associated with a form of bowel obstruction called intussusception, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. After physicians monitoring the system noticed a cluster of reports detailing intussusception in young vaccinated children, they commissioned additional studies comparing vaccinated patients with non-vaccinated patients. These studies found that the incidence of intussusception in vaccinated patients was significantly higher than in a control group. The vaccine was pulled from the market.  In this case, VAERS was used as an early warning system that prompted scientists to commission more comprehensive studies. The reports weren’t themselves used to make a determination about vaccine safety.  ""A system like VAERS can never answer the question of whether a vaccine causes a particular outcome,"" said Offit. ""The only way to establish causation is through a study involving a control group."" The COVID-19 vaccines now being rolled out to the public were subject to these kinds of studies to determine whether they caused serious health issues. Tens of thousands of people participated in clinical trials last year to demonstrate to regulators that the COVID-19 vaccines were safe. To receive FDA emergency-use authorization, vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna had to follow up with at least half of participants for at least two months after they received their vaccinations. A Facebook post from an anti-vaccine group shows a list of people who died after receiving COVID-19 vaccines, implying that the vaccine caused or contributed to those deaths.  The claim relies on reports from a federal tracking system of adverse events occurring after vaccinations. The agencies that maintain that system warn that the reports should not be used to draw conclusions about whether a vaccine causes a particular adverse event. To establish causation, experts look beyond isolated data points to studies of large groups of people to see if a negative symptom is more prominent in vaccinated people than in non-vaccinated ones.  The COVID-19 vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in tens of thousands of people.  We rate this statement Mostly False. ​",/factchecks/2021/feb/16/facebook-posts/says-death-reports-federal-database-show-fatal-ris/

Yes, California requires signature verification for mail-in ballots and Newsom recall petitions
","After Republicans seeking to recall California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said they had reached the number of signatures necessary to trigger a special election, one conservative influencer falsely claimed that the organizers have faced hurdles that voters in November’s election did not. ""So California is requiring signature verification for Gavin Newsom’s recall, but didn’t require it for the mail in ballots. How strange,"" said actor Kevin Sorbo, who starred as ""Hercules"" in a TV series about the mythological hero, in a tweet sent to hundreds of thousands of followers.  A screenshot of Kevin Sorbo's tweet making false claims about California's election laws. In fact, California did require signature verification for mail-in ballots for the 2020 election, as PolitiFact reported in the months leading up to Election Day. Several election officials, experts, journalists and fact-checkers debunked Sorbo’s Feb. 15 tweet soon after it was posted. But the tweet still circulated widely, picking up thousands of retweets and likes. It was further amplified on the platform by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Rudy Giuliani. The claim was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  A screenshot of Rudy Giuliani's Instagram post sharing Kevin Sorbo's false claims about California's election laws. In addition, Buzz Patterson, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully last year for Congress in California’s 7th Congressional District in the Sacramento area, made a similar false claim that vote-by-mail signatures were not verified during last year’s general election. Sorbo has previously pushed false information from his social media accounts, including the baseless claim that antifa was behind the U.S. Capitol riot. Facebook removed his page Feb. 12 for sharing debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines, a company spokesperson said.  This time, PolitiFact decided to step in with the facts. (Sorbo did not respond to a request for comment submitted through his website.) Election officials rejected Sorbo’s claim.  ""Sorbo’s tweet is not true,"" Sam Mahood, a spokesperson for the California Secretary of State’s Office wrote in an email, citing the office’s own fact check on this topic. ""That tweet was totally inaccurate,"" added Amber McReynolds, a national expert on election administration and Denver’s former elections director. For a vote-by-mail ballot to count in California, the voter must sign the outside of their ballot’s envelope before they return it. California election law then requires officials in all 58 counties to verify the signatures on the envelope using the voter’s signature on file, which is the one provided when a person registers to vote. The same law requires officials to cross-check recall petition signatures with the signature on a voter registration record.   FACT: CA county elections officials verify the signatures on EVERY✅vote-by-mail ballot ✅initiative, referendum, or recall petition ✅candidate nomination document.*Source:https://t.co/Laj17g6qk0 pic.twitter.com/RNtbU6FOM8 The method used to verify signatures for vote-by-mail ballots is different county-by-county. Some use software while others use county staff to examine signatures one at a time, Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation, told PolitiFact California last year.  Thousands of vote-by-mail ballot signatures are rejected every election when officials determine they don’t match with the signature on file. Nearly 50,000 were rejected last November, added Alexander, describing the rejections as ""clear evidence that there is a signature check requirement.""  A law signed in 2018 requires election officials to notify voters at least eight days before the certification of the election when they reject a signature and give them a chance to provide a valid one.  Signatures collected for petitions, like the effort to recall Newsom,are also verified at the county level. Mahood said the process should ""generally be the same"" as the process for verifying signatures on ballots, save for the fact that petitions carry multiple signatures, not one. Supporters of the recall have criticized Newsom for what they describe as draconian stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as for the state employment department’s failure to quickly issue jobless benefits over the past year as hundreds of thousands of people lost jobs during the shutdowns. In recent weeks, the governor has faced criticism for the state’s slow roll-out of COVID-19 vaccinations. Sorbo said, ""So California is requiring signature verification for Gavin Newsom’s recall, but didn’t require it for the mail in ballots."" On the contrary, California did require signature verification for mail-in ballots during the 2020 election. Officials in all 58 of the state’s counties were required by law to check the signature on each voter’s ballot envelope against the signature from that person’s voter registration.

Biden did not plan winter storm as ‘an attack on Texas’
","A powerful winter storm has left millions of people without power in Texas amid freezing temperatures. Some Facebook users blamed President Joe Biden — not for a particular policy, but for the storm itself. In a Feb. 15 post, Scott L. Biddle wrote that the storm resulted from ""weather manipulation and controlling the jet stream"" — something he assured people is ""not a conspiracy theory.""  ""Joe Biden's ‘Dark Winter’ statement was not a random thought, it was a foreshadow of what was to come,"" Biddle wrote. ""Texas is the only state to have its own, entirely independent electric grid separate from the rest of the United States. This is warfare, an attack on Texas by altering the jet stream, seeding the clouds, and ultimately causing the storm that blacked out over 4 million people."" ""Sound crazy? Too hard to believe? Believe it."" Don’t believe it. (Screenshot from Facebook) The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to Biddle — who wrote a book of COVID-19 conspiracy theories that was removed from Amazon — but we haven’t heard back. What he said isn’t true. First, let’s examine the ""‘dark winter’ statement."" In November, Biden said the coronavirus pandemic could worsen over the winter months as Americans traveled for the holidays and were forced indoors by colder weather. ""We’re still facing a very dark winter,"" he said. ""There are now nearly 10 million COVID cases in the United States."" Biden was not predicting a winter storm — he was predicting an influx of new daily COVID-19 cases and deaths, which hit record highs in early January and February, consecutively. Now onto the Facebook post’s claim about Texas’ power grid. In 1970, the state created the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to avoid regulation from the federal government. The electric grid is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. However, that doesn’t mean the Biden administration altered the weather to attack Texas’ energy infrastructure. The winter storm first hit the Pacific Northwest between Feb. 12-13, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power. Then, it moved through the Southwest before hitting the central and southern plains. The storm resulted from a polar vortex that brought Arctic air from Canada to many parts of the U.S. A polar vortex is a large area of low pressure and cold air surrounding the Earth’s poles. It weakens in the summer and strengthens in the winter, when the vortex expands and sends cold air southward with the jet stream. The jet stream is the product of strong winds created by Earth’s rotation on its axis — it would not be possible for the government to somehow step in and shake things up. The only measurable effect humans are thought to have on the jet stream is through climate change. ""Cloud seeding,"" on the other hand, is a real technique that’s sometimes used to produce moisture in drought-prone areas. Aircraft inject particles into clouds to encourage water droplets to freeze around them. In the right conditions, the process can create snow. Again, that’s not what is happening in Texas and many other parts of the country. Cloud seeding has been cited as evidence for the chemtrails conspiracy theory, which falsely claims the government uses aircraft to spray chemicals in the sky to control the population. We found posts from Biddle in groups dedicated to the conspiracy theory. The post is inaccurate and ridiculous.

No, NASA didn’t say human-caused climate change is a hoax
","Many pages on NASA’s website are dedicated to climate change: The causes of climate change, evidence of climate change, and information about scientific consensus among them.  ""The vast majority of actively publishing climate scientists — 97% — agree that humans are causing global warming and climate change,"" NASA notes on one such page titled ""Do scientists agree on climate change?"" An image spreading on social media ignores this and wrongly asserts that ""NASA admits that man-made climate change is a hoax!""  ""In 1958, NASA first observed that changes in the solar orbit of the earth, along with alterations to earth’s axial tilt, are both responsible for what climate scientists call ‘global warming.’ In no way, shape or form are humans warming the planet by using fossil fuels or eating beef."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here is what NASA actually says about climate change.  The earth’s climate has changed throughout history, and over 800,000 years, most of those changes are due to small variations in the Earth’s orbit, which affects how much solar energy the planet receives. But today’s trends are not a result of just variations to Earth’s orbit. NASA says there’s a greater than 95% probability that most of the current warming trend is the result of human activity since the mid-20th century. Increased levels of so-called greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, cause the Earth to warm by blocking heat from escaping the atmosphere and radiating it back toward the Earth’s surface.  Carbon dioxide can be released through, say, volcanic eruptions, but humans have also increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide by 47% since the Industrial Revolution started. Methane can likewise be produced through both natural sources and human activities, such as agriculture and livestock manure management. ""Human activities are changing the natural greenhouse,"" NASA says. ""Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.""

"['Wisconsin', 'Mark Pocan']","
Yes, Ron Johnson attended the impeachment hearings
","Social media hosted no shortage of debates amid former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment hearing, but a Feb 12, 2021, exchange centering around U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, was particularly unexpected. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisconsin, said Johnson was a no-show on what turned out to be the second-last day of the proceedings. ""Hey @SenRonJohnson, were you too busy fighting with YouTube fighting over your crackpot theories on Covid? Do your damn job and show up,"" Pocan tweeted about 9 a.m., referencing Johnson’s ongoing feud over YouTube removing a video Johnson posted of COVID-related testimony from his Senate committee. It prompted an expected dose of Twitter outrage, with posters condemning Johnson and saying he shouldn’t be able to vote if he didn’t show up. But later that day Johnson spokesman Ben Voelkel said that was a lie and told Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter Patrick Marley that Johnson had been in attendance throughout the trial. So who’s right? Pinning down attendance is tricky since the hearing took place in the Senate Chamber, but that wasn’t the only way for senators to watch the proceedings. The Senate adopted a resolution allowing senators to leave and watch from the upstairs gallery or from an adjacent room by television. So a senator being absent from the floor for a time doesn’t mean they weren’t watching. Pocan’s assertion that Johnson wasn’t there stemmed from a tweet by author Don Winslow, who has more than 600,000 followers on Twitter. The tweet showed pictures of Johnson and 13 other senators, describing them as ""the Senators that chose not to attend the impeachment trial today.""  It was retweeted more than 10,000 times before Winslow deleted it sometime Feb. 12. An archived version of the tweet shows it was posted at 1:37 a.m. central time on Feb. 12. Since Winslow lives in California, that would have been 11:37 p.m. on Feb. 11 — meaning it was likely referencing the Feb. 11 proceedings, which had concluded hours earlier. This tweet was spreading widely in the middle of the day Feb. 12, so many interpreted it to be referencing Feb. 12, but the Senate proceedings didn’t begin until 11 a.m. central, about 10 hours after this tweet was sent. We’ll examine both days. In an email to PolitiFact the evening of Feb. 12, Voelkel said his understanding is that Johnson ""has been there the entire time."" But we don’t have to take his word for it. Johnson was obviously at the hearings Feb. 12. As noted, it’s not possible to prove his location at every moment in the day, but CSPAN video shows Johnson in his assigned seat (back row on the left, fourth from the left as viewed from the front of the room) during a standing ovation for Capitol police officers’ work Jan. 6. In addition, Getty Images captured a picture of him during a recess in the proceedings, USA TODAY captured a photo of him after the day’s session ended and CNN posted an update at 1:30 p.m. with Johnson commenting on the day’s proceedings. Various news organizations also captured images of Johnson in the Capitol around the Feb. 11 hearings: Getty has a picture of him arriving at the beginning, and the Associated Press took a photo of him leaving at the end. CNN reported Feb. 11 at least 15 empty desks on the Republican side at one point, though, as noted, those senators could have been watching from other locations, and the online report didn’t list the senators missing. Pocan’s office provided no evidence that Johnson was absent either day.  Spokesman Usamah Andrabi said the office has ""first-hand reports of him being out of the room at times,"" but with viewing setup from multiple locations that doesn’t prove this claim. Andrabi also asserted the ""focus"" of the tweet was on Johnson’s COVID conspiracy theories, though that doesn’t ring true given the post was a quote retweet of a claim about Johnson’s attendance. Pocan told Johnson to ""do your damn job and show up,"" retweeting a claim that Johnson wasn’t present for that day’s impeachment proceedings. The timeline is a bit odd here, since the tweet that spurred this discussion likely was referencing Feb. 11, but it was being shared and debated in many cases as if it referenced to Feb. 12. In either case the now-deleted tweet was wrong about Johnson. We don’t know what Johnson was doing every moment of every day, but we have photographic proof he was at the Capitol for the Feb. 11 and Feb. 12 impeachment hearings. That makes a claim he didn’t ""show up"" absurd. Pocan’s office provided no convincing evidence to the contrary. So we have a claim based on a deleted tweet that conflicts with an array of photographic and other documented evidence. That’s false and ridiculous.  Or as we call it, Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2021/feb/16/mark-pocan/yes-ron-johnson-attended-impeachment-hearings/

The Alfred was named in honor of Alfred the Great, the king of Wessex credited with building the first English naval force, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command.
