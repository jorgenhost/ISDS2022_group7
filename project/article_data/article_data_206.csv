"['Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says Obama called Medicaid “broken” four years ago
","
""If you don’t believe me that Medicaid is broken, just ask our president,"" Texas Gov. Rick Perry told the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 14, 2013. 
""Four years ago, he said, and I quote, ‘We can't simply put more people into a broken system that doesn't work,’ end quote."" 
In Perry’s speech at the American Conservative Union’s annual gathering of activists, he described Medicaid as ""on its way to bankruptcy"" and vowed he wouldn’t join other Republican governors who had gotten on board with Obamacare’s expansion of the state-federal program, which insures low-income Americans. 
But did President Barack Obama say it was ""broken""? 
An Internet search will quickly enough direct the curious reader to Obama’s remark, made June 2, 2009, at the White House before a health-care discussion with Senate Democrats. Between the quotation marks Perry indicated, he captured Obama’s words; here we present them with more context: 
As we move forward on health care reform, it is not sufficient for us simply to add more people to Medicare or Medicaid to increase the rolls, to increase coverage in the absence of cost controls and reform.  And let me repeat this principle: If we don't get control over costs, then it is going to be very difficult for us to expand coverage. These two things have to go hand in hand.  Another way of putting it is we can't simply put more people into a broken system that doesn't work. 
So we've got to reform the underlying system.  And this means promoting best practices, not just the most expensive practices. 
(Click here to read Obama’s full speech, and here to watch Perry’s speech.) 
Perry spokesman Josh Havens confirmed by email that the governor was referring to this Obama speech, and pointed out a precedent in Obama’s 2006 book, ""The Audacity of Hope"": 
  
  
As initially passed in 2010, Obamacare would have required states to expand Medicaid by opening the program to all households with income below 138 percent of the federal poverty level — which in 2013 is $15,865 for an individual, $32,499 for a family of four. A June 2012 Supreme Court decision gave states the choice to opt in or opt out of expanding their Medicaid rolls, which is the decision Texas currently faces. 
But much more was at stake in mid-2009. Obama’s health-care overhaul would not pass the Senate until Dec. 24, 2009; the House passed it March 21, 2010. 
A CNN timeline shows Obama had told Congress in February 2009 that health care reform would not wait another year and held a White House summit on health care in March 2009. 
In June 2009, Obama launched what news stories in the Washington Post, New York Times and other papers described as a full-on push to get comprehensive health care legislation drafted and passed. 
The speech Perry quoted was one salvo. Obama hit the same notes in a letter sent to the Senate Democratic leaders after that meeting and in his June 5, 2009, weekly radio/Internet address. 
In each, Obama called the health-care system ""broken"" and specified that rising health care costs were the problem, citing Medicaid as a factor in the letter but not in the speech. 
  
Obama’s letter said, ""Soaring health care costs make our current course unsustainable"" and ""the ever-increasing cost of Medicare and Medicaid are among the main drivers of enormous budget deficits."" In the radio address, he did not name Medicaid or Medicare but said, ""We will seize this historic opportunity to finally fix what ails our broken health-care system"" by attacking ""the root causes of skyrocketing health care costs."" 
White House spokeswoman Joanna Rosholm declined to comment on Perry’s claim. 
We asked Havens for his thoughts on Obama’s references to the health-care system (not just Medicaid) as broken. Havens replied by email: ""No matter how you want to look at it, the president specifically referred to Medicaid when he was talking about a broken system that doesn’t work."" 
Our ruling 
Perry said that Obama called Medicaid ""broken."" In context, it’s clear the president was including Medicaid as a significant part of the entire health care system and that his larger point was that health care costs need to be reined in. Still, Obama described expanding the Medicare and Medicaid rolls as putting ""more people in a broken system.""

Air travelers get background checks but some gun buyers don’t, says Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy
","
Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, whose state is still mourning the massacre of 20 first-graders and six adults at an elementary school, is pushing for a federal expansion of background checks on gun purchases. 
In an interview on MSNBC, Malloy cited strong public support for expanded checks and claimed that another, more pedestrian area of American life is more tightly controlled than weapon transfers. 
""I’m a governor. I can’t get on a plane in the United States without someone doing a background check on me, but I could go places in this country and buy a weapon and not have that done. It makes no sense to anybody, quite frankly,"" he said. 
We wondered if that’s true -- that air travelers are subject to background checks, and how it compares with the requirements on gun purchases. 
First, guns. Federal law requires federally licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks before selling a firearm. There is no federal law that requires private gun dealers -- such as those selling at gun shows -- to do such background checks. Gun control advocates want the background check requirement expanded to cover those and other private purchases. 
According to federal figures, applicants who are denied a firearm through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System are rejected for having a prior criminal conviction or restraining order, being a fugitive from justice or in the United States illegally, being under indictment or having been dishonorably discharged from the military. Others are denied because they failed to acknowledge their record on the initial form. 
So what’s required of air travelers? 
Malloy’s spokeswoman, Juliet Manalan, told us that Malloy was referring to the Secure Flight program, created in response to the 9/11 Commission’s recommendation of uniform pre-screening of passenger information against government watch lists. 
The program, run by the Transportation Security Administration, requires airline passengers to provide their name, date of birth and gender to be matched against watch lists including the ""no fly"" list. That list, which is classified, contains the names of suspected terrorists who are barred from boarding planes flying in or out of the United States. It does not bar felons or other convicted criminals from flying. 
""In short: there is a list that prevents people from boarding a plane, but no list that prevents people who shouldn’t have firearms from purchasing them,"" Manalan said. 
So there’s a list, but is there a background check? 
Not exactly, and not a criminal one. 
""Passengers names are checked against the no-fly and selectee list via the Secure Flight process, but they do not undergo the fingerprint-based criminal history record check/security threat assessment process that airport/airline employees undergo,"" said Jeffrey Price, an aerospace professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver. 
Douglas Laird, an independent aviation security expert, called it a stretch to describe the airline procedure as a background check. 
""TSA runs the data received from the airlines computer reservations systems through various databases, but this is not a background check by any stretch of the imagination,"" Laird said. 
Still, there is a definite security element to the airlines’ process. 
""It is basic information, but the airlines could use it for a background check. I believe that is what (Malloy) is trying to say,"" said Clifford Winston, an economist with the centrist Brookings Institution. ""I don’t think it is the case that before you can buy a ticket, you have to undergo a background check."" 
Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with the advisory firm Hudson Crossing, added, ""It may not be a true ‘background check,’ but passenger data is passed through a database (possibly more than one) to detect possible terrorists."" 
Our ruling 
Malloy said he ""can’t get on a plane in the United States without someone doing a background check on me,"" while less oversight exists for gun purchases. 
Background checks on gun purchases -- which assess a person’s criminal history -- do not apply to the private transfer of weapons, only to purchases from licensed gun dealers. And it’s true that many guns are bought legally with no background check. 
But the Secure Flight program does not check people’s legal history in the same way. It compares passenger information with lists of suspected terrorists. It’s a security measure, but not a true background check. Though unlike with guns, it applies to everyone. 
Malloy’s statement is only partially accurate. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C162D80>],/factchecks/2013/apr/09/dannel-malloy/air-travelers-get-background-checks-some-gun-buyer/
"['National', 'Crime', 'Guns', 'Rahm Emanuel']","
Mayor Rahm Emanuel says Chicago takes more guns off the streets than New York or L.A.
","New York and Los Angeles beat out Chicago as the nation’s most populous cities. But Chicago has more guns on the streets, Mayor Rahm Emanuel told CNN. That was his answer when CNN host Jake Tapper asked on April 2, 2013: With some of the nation’s strictest gun laws, why are your homicide rates still so high? Without uniform gun policies — say, in neighboring Indiana and Wisconsin — weapons still flow, Emanuel said. ""We take more guns off the streets than New York or L.A.,"" he said. Emanuel, who formerly was President Barack Obama's  White House chief of staff, is part of a group of mayors that’s fighting for stricter national gun laws. We were curious: Does America’s No. 3 most populous city take No. 1 in gun seizures? Chicago’s guns We talked with Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman in Emanuel’s office. He said the city uses the comparison with New York and Los Angeles to demonstrate that Chicago’s strict gun control rules won’t work by themselves. (Opponents of gun control measures argue the city offers evidence that such laws don’t work, period.) New York and California both have stricter gun control laws than Illinois. Guns cross into Chicago not just from Indiana and Wisconsin, but from areas right outside the city. ""Chicago is not an island,"" McCaffrey said. In the first six months of last year, the city — not counting gun buybacks or turn-ins — seized 3,912 guns. That’s as many as New York and Los Angeles combined, according to the University of Chicago Crime Lab, which got numbers from the cities’ police departments. In Chicago, police picked up illegal weapons at crime scenes and traffic stops, found them with search warrants and investigations, or heard about them when people called 911 to report a ""man with a gun"" or ""shots fired."" In the same months that Chicago recovered 3,912 guns, Los Angeles got 2,296 and New York 1,385. That wasn’t an anomaly, according to Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, who has testified before Congress in favor of strengthening federal measures to reduce gun trafficking. For several years under the Clinton administration, an effort to fight youth crime collected gun-tracing data for major U.S. cities. ""I can tell you that Chicago consistently recovered more guns than any of the other cities, N.Y.C. and L.A. included,"" Webster said. We pulled those reports from 1998, 1999 and 2000. Chicago recovered and traced more guns than either New York or Los Angeles in all three years. In 1998, it picked up 16,222 weapons — more than the two larger cities together. Why? Webster points out that the city has a lot of gangs, and gangs and guns go together. Its police department cracks down on illegal gun possession, making arrests more likely. And Illinois gun control laws aren’t nearly as strong as those in New York and California in deterring gun trafficking into the city, he said. Webster told House Democrats in March that studies show state gun laws are undermined by gaps in federal law — people buy guns in states with the weakest laws to sell in states with the toughest laws. The same idea works for counties and cities. In Chicago, all it takes is a drive outside the city limits, the New York Times reported, such as to Chuck’s Gun Shop in Riverdale, Ill., the source of more than 1,300 weapons seized in Chicago since 2008. The same store was identified as a key source of crime guns in a New York Times piece in 1999. Our ruling Emanuel, arguing for stronger federal laws to help Chicago tamp down on gun crime, said, ""we take more guns off the streets than New York or L.A."" Gun seizure data gathered by the University of Chicago Crime Lab and a federal youth crime initiative show just that. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097180900>],/factchecks/2013/apr/09/rahm-emanuel/mayor-rahm-emanuel-says-chicago-takes-more-guns-st/
"['Georgia', 'Candidate Biography', 'Federal Budget', 'Paul Broun']","
Broun takes on rival’s record on proposed cuts
","
Timing is everything in politics. So U.S. Rep. Paul Broun didn’t take long to distinguish himself from a new candidate in what could be the most interesting statewide political primary in Georgia in years. 
Broun, an Athens Republican, was speaking to the University of Georgia College Republicans on March 27 when he was asked about the campaign for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Republican Saxby Chambliss. That same day, U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, a Republican from Marietta, announced he was entering the 2014 race for the Senate seat.  
On the surface, it seems there are few differences between the two candidates. Both men are medical doctors. Both are fierce critics of President Barack Obama’s policies. But Broun told the students there is at least one difference between him and Gingrey. 
""In the last two years, I have supported and proposed $155 billion worth of targeting cuts. Dr. Gingrey has presented zero,"" Broun said, according to the Red & Black newspaper. ""I have the record, and I have the will to say ‘no’ to the out of control spending. There’s a big difference between the two of us and anybody else who will get in this race."" 
PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out if Broun was correct about what he’s done -- and what he said Gingrey has not done. 
First, let’s look at Broun’s proposed cuts. The congressman has introduced several dozen amendments in the past two years to curb federal spending, records show. 
Some of those include legislation in June 2012 to eliminate funding for the Transportation Security Administration that Broun said would save the federal government slightly more than $5 billion. A year earlier, Broun proposed legislation that would cut $940 million in grant funding. He’s proposed cutting the Energy Department’s Office of Science account by $820 million, and reducing the federal government’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children by about $600 million. 
None of those pieces of legislation passed. 
Broun also has tried several times to introduce legislation to take away funding for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known to most as Obamacare. The federal government’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has concluded the health care law will cost at least $251 billion by 2019. The agency calculated the estimated cost of expanding health care coverage, $828 billion, and subtracted that number by what it believes will be a savings of $577 billion through Medicare, Medicaid and other reforms. 
Broun has suggested replacing the federal health care law with what he calls the ""OPTION Act,"" a plan he says will give Americans complete control of their health care. By considering Broun’s efforts to repeal the health care law alone, the congressman is on the money about the first part of his claim. 
Now, let’s look at whether he’s correct about Gingrey not proposing any cuts. We asked Broun’s team for details. Broun was referring to the House appropriations and re-authorization processes, explained Broun spokeswoman Meredith Griffanti. 
The House Appropriations Committee only accepts legislation on federal discretionary spending from committee members. Discretionary spending -- which excludes iconic programs like  Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- accounts for about 40 percent of the federal budget. Like Broun, Gingrey is not a member of the committee. However, Gingrey can offer amendments to resolutions that are proposed. And he can introduce his own resolutions to the entire House of Representatives. 
Gingrey’s team sent us a few examples of cuts that Gingrey authored in resolutions since 2011. 
In January 2011 and January 2013, Gingrey introduced the Federal Employee Accountability Act, which would remove guidelines that allow federal employees to conduct union activities during official work hours. Gingrey argued it would save $1.3 billion over 10 years. Gingrey has pitched the idea a few times in recent years. 
In 2011, Gingrey presented a bill, the State Flexibility Act, which he argued would give states more financial wiggle room and save money. Gingrey argued at the time that 8 million more Americans were projected to join state Medicaid programs in the next few years. PolitiFact Georgia rated that claim Half True. 
Gingrey also has proposed a resolution called the Congressional Budget Accountability Act. The bill would return all funds remaining in congressional office budgets at the end of a calendar year to the Treasury Department to reduce the deficit. 
We asked Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint if he thought Broun’s assertion about Gingrey was correct. 
""If (Broun is) saying it’s zero, it’s not true,"" said Swint, who’s been following Gingrey for years. 
Our conclusion: 
Broun said in the last two years, he has supported and proposed $155 billion worth of targeting cuts, while Gingrey has presented zero.  
We believe the first part of Broun’s claim was on the money. But the second part needs more context to be fully understood. Although Gingrey is not a member of the House Appropriations Committee, he has proposed legislation aimed at cutting discretionary spending. 
Our rating: Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280969D2940>],/factchecks/2013/apr/09/paul-broun/broun-takes-rivals-record-proposed-cuts/
"['Ohio', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'John Kasich']","
John Kasich says Oklahoma, Texas have “sky high” taxes on oil and gas but are reducing or have no income tax
","
Gov. John Kasich pitched several changes to Ohio’s tax structure in his budget proposal for fiscal 2014-2015 that would, in part, allow reductions in the state’s individual income tax. 
Among those proposals was an increase to the state’s severance tax, a tax levied on oil and gas resources when they are extracted -- or severed -- from the ground. The change would target large producers engaged in horizontal drilling and raise an estimated $45 million in fiscal 2014 and $155 million in fiscal 2015. 
Kasich often has said the tax is too low. As energy companies tap oil and natural gas resources in the resource-rich Utica Shale formation in eastern Ohio, the governor has argued Ohio should reap a greater reward from nature’s bounty. 
While in the Mahoning Valley on March 21, the governor touted his budget plans, including the severance tax increase, to the Youngstown-Warren Regional Chamber of Commerce, and again in an interview with a Youngstown television station. 
""Right now, Texas doesn’t have an income tax and Oklahoma’s lowering their income tax rates, and guess what their severance tax is? Sky high,"" Kasich told the interviewer. 
PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the governor’s claim. 
We started with the first part of his claim about Texas and Oklahoma and income taxes. We quickly confirmed that Texas, indeed, does not have a state income tax. 
Oklahoma has a state income tax with seven brackets for individual incomes. The income thresholds for the brackets are grouped closely together, with the top taxing bracket kicking in for income over $15,000 a year. The median household income for the state for 2007-2011 was slightly below $44,300 a year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. 
The rate for the top bracket for tax year for tax filers this year is $395 plus 5.25 percent of the amount over $15,000. That rate reflects a tax reduction of 0.25 percent from the previous year. 
So Kasich appears to be correct about the state income tax rates. 
But what about the two states’ taxes on oil and gas resources? Are they, as the governor said, "" sky high""? 
""Sky high"" isn’t quantifiable. But we can look at how Texas and Oklahoma compare with other states, including Ohio. That picture, though, is somewhat muddied as the manner in which oil and natural gas production is taxed varies from state to state. 
Data from the National Conference of State Legislatures showed, though, that the taxes for 2012 in Oklahoma and Texas, while not the highest, were among the national leaders. 
Texas charges a 7.5-percent tax on the market value of natural gas. Oklahoma charges 7 percent on the market value, with provisions that reduce the rate if the price per thousand cubic feet (MCF) falls below $2.10. That has happened in just two months since 2000, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
Texas collects a 4.6-percent tax on oil’s market value . Oklahoma collects 7 percent, with provisions for the tax to drop if the price per barrel falls below $17. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil hasn’t been that low in more than 10 years at Cushing, Okla., a major trading hub for crude oil. It has been above $90 per barrel all this year. 
How does that compare to other states? 
The NCSL data showed that gas taxes for both states are in the top 10, as was Oklahoma’s tax on oil. Texas’ oil tax was lower, but it also has the highest production, by far.  In 2010, Texas accounted for nearly 26 percent of domestic oil production, more than double No. 2 Alaska. 
Ohio’s rates, by contrast, are much lower. 
Natural gas is taxed at 3 cents per MCF. The governor has proposed it be increased to 1 percent of the value of the gas extracted via horizontal wells. So, for example, if the average price is $3.35 per MCF at the wellhead, as the U.S. Energy Information Administration listed for December, the state would collect 3.35 cents per MCF, rather than the 3 cents at Ohio’s current rate. The collection would rise as the price of gas rises. 
Oil is taxed at 20 cents per barrel. Kasich’s proposal would increase that tax for horizontal wells to 1.5 percent of the price per barrel initially and to 4 percent after one year. So if oil commands a price of $90 per barrel, the state tax would generate $1.35 per barrel initially and $3.60 after the first year, rather than the 20 cents per barrel at Ohio’s current rate. 
Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said the governor’s point was that the taxes are ""sky high"" when compared to Ohio. And because oil and gas are exported out of those states, he said, the tax burden is also exported. 
""Not all oil drilled in Texas is consumed in Texas,"" he said. ""Other states are exporting their tax costs to us. His proposal would allow Ohio to do the same."" 
Kasich’s description of income taxes in Texas (none) and Oklahoma (reduced) was correct. 
As for the other part of his claim, while ""sky high"" is somewhat subjective, the reality of the tax structure now is that the significantly higher tax rates on gas and oil in Texas and Oklahoma, when compared to Ohio, can generate revenues that are -- well -- sky high.   
Texas and Oklahoma are among the leaders for natural gas, but not tops. Oklahoma also has one of the highest oil rates. And at current prices, Texas’ tax on oil, the lower of the two states, would yield more than 20 times what Ohio’s current per-barrel tax raises. 

On the Truth-O-Meter, Kasich’s claim rates True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096870C80>],/factchecks/2013/apr/08/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-oklahoma-texas-have-sky-high-taxe/
"['LGBTQ', 'Florida', 'Nadine Smith']","
Equality Florida director Nadine Smith says gay couples can face $300,000 in added costs
","
First comes love, then comes marriage ... then comes the potential savings of a joint tax return. That’s the story for opposite-sex couples, but not necessarily for same-sex couples. 
Gay couples aren’t entitled to some of the money-saving benefits available to opposite-sex married couples. But how much lost money is it for a gay couple? 
Equality Florida, a group that advocates on behalf of the gay community, raised that topic as the U.S. Supreme Court heard two cases related to gay marriage in March: a challenge to California’s Proposition 8, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, and a challenge to the federal Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. (For more on the cases read PolitiFact’s primer.) 
The DOMA case stems from a financial issue involving Edith ""Edie"" Windsor, who lived with Thea Spyer for 44 years; they married in Canada in 2007. After Spyer’s death in 2009, Windsor had to pay $363,000 in taxes on her spouse’s estate rather than inheriting it outright, as mixed-gender married couples routinely do. 
Nadine Smith, executive director of Equality Florida, wrote in a press release on March 27 that she was hopeful the Supreme Court would move to end the federal ban on same-sex marriage: 
""If observers are correct, gay married couples including my wife and I will not be faced with tax forms that require us to lie and deny the existence of our spouse. The financial penalties imposed because we are considered legal strangers can cost us more than $300,000 compared with married heterosexual couples over a lifetime. In a stroke, this financial burden will be erased."" 
We wanted to research how Smith concluded that gay couples can pay $300,000 more than heterosexual couples over a lifetime. 
Cost estimates for gay couples 
In response to our questions, Smith sent us media reports that mentioned various higher costs for gay couples ranging from taxes, to renting a car to divorce. 
The most in-depth analysis came from the New York Times, which spent two months in 2009 calculating the added costs of being a gay couple over a lifetime, including taxes, health insurance, pensions, having a child and other expenses. 
For the tax portion, the New York Times received assistance from Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The analysis created a fictitious couple in New York, gave them two kids and assumed one parent would stay home for five years to take care of them. The analysis took factors into account based on three states with large gay populations: Florida, New York and California. (The New York Times provided  25 pages of details on how they arrived at the calculations.) 
The newspaper calculated two separate scenarios, both starting when the couples were 35. In the first scenario, one partner earned $110,000 and the other $30,000; in the second, each earned $70,000. 
The conclusion: the worst-case scenario over a couple’s lifetime was $467,562. But that fell to $41,196 in the best-case scenario, for a couple with better health insurance and lower taxes. The numbers varied depending on income and other factors. 
""For wealthy couples with a lot of assets, on the other hand, the cost of being gay could easily spiral into the millions,"" the New York Times wrote. 
One of the reporters who wrote the story, Tara Siegel-Bernard, and two of the experts consulted for that story told PolitiFact Florida that the dollar figures in 2009 would change in 2013. But without thoroughly redoing the analysis, it was hard to assess by how much. 
One key factor that has changed since then is that in 2011, New York passed a law allowing same-sex marriage. The couple could now file a joint state income tax return, which may or may not save a gay couple money. There have also been some health insurance changes. 
Even if the Supreme Court strikes down DOMA, it won’t erase all the financial and legal hurdles for gay couples, the New York Times wrote. For example, many couples would still have to travel to another state to get married. 
""It is hard to present any sort of average -- people are in very different situations for all the reasons you noted,"" said Lee Badgett, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts who has studied gay marriage. 
We sent Equality Florida’s claim to the the National Organization for Marriage, a group that opposes gay marriage. The group’s political director Frank Schubert also noted that the New York Times analysis was built on multiple assumptions. 
Schubert disagreed with some assumptions. ""For example, in one of the scenarios the New York Times assumed that the same-sex couple would not receive any health coverage for one of the partners for the entire duration of their 50-year relationship. Many companies already provide health coverage for domestic partners, and this percentage is growing rapidly. Policy makers could address this issue without redefining marriage. Similarly, the analysis was conducted before New York redefined marriage, which makes the state tax calculations moot."" 
We asked Smith in an email why she cited the $300,000 figure. 
""I guess I could have said more than $400,000 but I was being conservative. Edie Windsor was forced to pay $363,000 because her marriage was not recognized, so it is number that is familiar to the general public. In addition, Florida is the least hospitable of the three states used in the modeling: Florida, New York and California."" 
Parenting among gay couples is more common in the South than other regions of the country, ""so we are seeing the additional costs add up,"" wrote Smith, who along with her wife is raising a son. (They married in Vermont.) 
Our ruling 
Nadine Smith, the director of Equality Florida, said, ""The financial penalties imposed"" on gay couples ""can cost us more than $300,000 compared with married heterosexual couples over a lifetime."" 
Smith said ""penalties"" are ""imposed"" on same-sex couples. Actually, it's more accurate to say that they don't have access to the same benefits as opposite-sex couples. 
On the question of numbers, is it possible that for some gay couples, the cost would add up to $300,000 over a lifetime? The key here is that word ""can."" It is difficult to come up with an average because the taxes, health insurance and expenses vary from couple to couple depending on where they live and other factors. The most extensive analysis we saw from the New York Times calculated a range between about $41,196 and $467,562 in 2009. 
The $300,000 cited by Smith falls within that range but requires some explanation. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809731F4C0>],/factchecks/2013/apr/08/nadine-smith/equality-florida-director-nadine-smith-says-gay-co/

Ted Cruz says expanding Medicaid will ""worsen health care options for the most vulnerable""
","
Editor's note: After we published this report, the staff at Cruz's office gave us more information to consider. We considered that evidence in a separate report, but it did not change our initial findings or our ruling. Our original report remains below.  
Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who is gaining a reputation for bold statements, is backing Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s decision to reject a major expansion of Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. 
Under the new health care law, states can get federal dollars to enroll their uninsured residents in Medicaid. Some politicians, including Cruz and Perry, argue that taking the federal money now leaves the state on the hook for long-term fiscal commitments it can’t afford. 
Cruz, though, has gone beyond arguing that the expansion is too expensive. He recently said it would also leave the uninsured worse off. 
""Our friends who are saying they want health care do not realize that expanding Medicaid will worsen health care options for the most vulnerable among us in Texas,"" Cruz said at an event with Perry and others in the state capitol in Austin. 
This struck some observers as illogical: How could moving someone who’s uninsured onto the Medicaid rolls actually worsen someone’s health care options? 
When we checked with Cruz’s office, they referred us to a floor speech he gave on March 13, 2013. Here’s the relevant portion of that speech: 
""The data demonstrates Medicaid beneficiaries face worse health outcomes than just about anybody else in the marketplace. In 2010, the Annals of Surgery issued a landmark study which examined the outcomes from nearly 900,000 individuals undergoing surgery from 2003 to 2007. ... Medicaid patients, when compared to people without health insurance, people who were uninsured, Medicaid patients were 13 percent more likely to die. They stayed in the hospital for 50 percent longer and cost 20 percent more. 
""In 2011, Johns Hopkins did a study of patients undergoing lung transplantation. Their conclusions were very much the same. They found that Medicaid patients were 8.1 percent less likely to be alive 10 years after the transplant compared with those with private insurance and also compared to those without any insurance at all. Overall, the Johns Hopkins study found that Medicaid patients faced a 29-percent greater risk of death, and yet Obamacare is moving more and more of the economically disadvantaged onto Medicaid, which subjects them to those worse health care outcomes."" 
This is a line of argument that had appeared earlier in a number of conservative outlets, including a Wall Street Journal op-ed and a Manhattan Institute briefing paper. These analyses offered some additional studies with similar findings. Even though Cruz did not specifically mention these other studies, they have been cited so frequently in the debate that we will include them in our analysis. 
To start, we should note that even many critics of Cruz’s perspective acknowledge some concerns about the Medicaid expansion under the new health care law. 
First, most experts we contacted agreed that studies, including the two Cruz specifically cited, show that patients on Medicaid tend not to have health outcomes as positive as patients on private insurance (though they add that Medicaid is not necessarily the cause, since it’s hard to disentangle insurance status from socioeconomic and lifestyle factors). 
Second, experts acknowledge that Medicaid is not a perfect program and that various policy changes could make it more effective. And third, they say that adding millions of additional beneficiaries under the new health care law will impose additional strains on the program. 
That said, our examination of the medical papers, including interviews with some authors of the studies in question, suggests that Cruz has made too big a leap by arguing that an uninsured patient actually becomes worse off when they sign up for Medicaid. 
Here are a few of the reasons for caution: 
• The trends are more mixed than Cruz’s claim suggests. In many of the studies, uninsured patients did end up having better outcomes than Medicaid patients did, such as fewer complications and longer survival. But this trend isn’t universal. For instance, in one study, Medicaid patients had worse outcomes for clogged arteries but better outcomes for abdominal aortic aneurysms. 
• The authors of the studies do not make the argument Cruz does. Not one of the half-dozen studies we looked at articulated Cruz’s argument that someone will have a worse health outcome if they move from no insurance to Medicaid. 
The studies generally did not focus on comparing Medicaid patients to uninsured patients. Rather, they focused on the performance of Medicaid and uninsured patients collectively, compared to Medicare and private insurance on the other hand. In addition, most papers inserted extensive language urging caution about the limitations of their research. 
What Cruz and others have done is ""the worst kind of selective reading of the studies,"" said Michael A. Gaglia Jr., a professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine and the co-author of one of the papers. 
• The definition of ""uninsured"" in these studies is too fuzzy to be reliable. In these studies, the term ""uninsured"" doesn’t just refer to the popular image of someone who’s too economically strapped to afford health insurance. It can also include poor people getting free charity care from world-class hospitals, very wealthy patients who pay their own bills rather than carrying health insurance, and healthy young adults who gambled by not obtaining insurance but got sick anyway. Each of these patient groupings may have advantages in recovering more quickly, which could explain some of the the better outcomes among the uninsured. 
Meanwhile, the definition of Medicaid is also fuzzy because people can sign up for Medicaid after being diagnosed with a serious ailment at a hospital. The studies didn’t distinguish between patients who have been on Medicaid for years, people who were uninsured for years but suddenly signed up for Medicaid before receiving treatment, and those who remained uninsured all the way through treatment. 
• The number of both Medicaid patients and the uninsured who were studied was quite small. In many of the studies, private insurance and Medicare patients dominated the pool of those studied. (Medicare is the federal health insurance program for Americans over age 65; because it’s mandatory for seniors, it includes people of all income levels.) Typically, uninsured patients and those on Medicaid represented 3 percent to 5 percent of the individuals studied. Experts say it’s unwise to draw sweeping conclusions from small sample sizes. 
• The Annals of Surgery study Cruz cited has an important quirk in the results. The study looked at 11 types of surgery and found that in all 11, the outcomes were worse for Medicaid patients than for the uninsured. However, in 10 of those cases, patients on Medicare also had worse outcomes than the uninsured did. As Boston University health economist Austin Frakt has put it, ""Any theory to explain what’s going on in Medicaid had better explain Medicare, too."" 
• Other studies have shown a positive health benefit from joining Medicaid. A recent study in Oregon compares Medicaid enrollees who had been chosen by a lottery to uninsured residents who were not enrolled. The study indicated that the new Medicaid enrollees reported better health than those who remained uninsured, though the findings are preliminary. 
Our ruling 
Cruz said that ""expanding Medicaid will worsen health care options for the most vulnerable among us in Texas."" 
Not only does this assertion make no logical sense -- some health coverage should always be an improvement over none -- but the evidence Cruz and others have pointed to also doesn’t back up his point. None of the studies make the argument Cruz does, and the small sample sizes of uninsured patients, combined with the challenge of defining the terms ""Medicaid"" and ""uninsured,"" pose serious questions about whether Cruz’s conclusion is valid. In fact, several authors of the papers we contacted disagreed with Cruz’s interpretation of their research. 
This sweeping generalization does not hold up. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C41EE00>],/factchecks/2013/apr/08/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-expanding-medicaid-will-worsen-healt/
"['Ohio', 'Transportation', 'John Kasich']","
Gov. John Kasich says his turnpike plan would lower tolls
","
After some tinkering by the General Assembly, Gov. John Kasich on April 1 signed into law a two-year transportation budget that charts a new future for the state-owned Ohio Turnpike. 
Kasich’s signature -- and his line-item veto of an annual reimbursement to railroad operators -- ended months of debate and speculation about what would make the final version. 
Despite early talk of privatization, the turnpike will remain a public asset. The bill also raises the speed limit to 70 mph on rural highways and aims to raise billions of dollars for road projects. 
But questions remain, and that brings us to Kasich’s recent appearance on ""State of Ohio,"" a weekly program produced by Cleveland’s WVIZ ideastream and its Statehouse News Bureau. 
During an interview, the Republican governor told host Karen Kasler that his proposal ""would make sure we have lower tolls than we’ve had through the history of the turnpike."" 
The claim caught our ear because the plan, as has been reported by The Plain Dealer and others, calls for tolls to increase for at least 10 years. Was Kasich taking us out for a spin? 
PolitiFact Ohio decided to find out how the Truth-O-Meter tolls. 
Kasich taped the interview March 20, the same day the Senate approved a conference committee report that shaped the final version of his transportation budget. The House approved the report a day later. The bill did not change between March 20 and the April 1 signing. 
So let’s examine the crux of Kasich’s turnpike plan. 
The bill approved by the legislature allows the state, for the first time, to use revenue from the Ohio Turnpike for projects beyond the 241-mile toll road. By raising tolls in each of the next 10 years, Ohio can issue $1.5 billion in bonds to help pay for transportation initiatives that might have been delayed a decade or longer. Kasich hopes to leverage that bond money into an equal amount of federal and local cash, creating a $3 billion pot for roads and bridges in coming years. 
The new law requires that 90 percent of the money be spent within 75 miles of the turnpike. The governor projects the work will support 65,000 jobs. And he hinted April 1 that Opportunity Corridor, a long-planned link from Interstate 490 through Cleveland to University Circle, might benefit. 
So what about those ""lower tolls"" Kasich mentioned in his TV interview? 
Here’s where it gets complicated. If you have an E-ZPass, the bill freezes your tolls for the next 10 years on trips of 30 miles or less. But that only applies to passenger cars -- not commercial trucks. For all others, the intention is to raise tolls at no more than the rate of inflation. 
Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols cited these stipulations when PolitiFact Ohio asked about the governor’s remarks. Over 20 years, tolls have risen ""almost three times the rate of inflation for cars,"" Nichols said, attributing the figure to a state-commissioned turnpike analysis. 
The 2012 report from KPMG Corporate Finance LLC found that between 1993 and 2012, the rolling average increase in Ohio toll rates per mile was 7.2 percent for passenger cars. 
""The increase in toll rates outpaced the average annual growth of CPI [the Consumer Price Index], which was 2.5% over the same time period,"" the KPMG report states. 
KPMG now estimates annual CPI growth for the Midwest at 2.7 percent. Essentially, the Kasich administration intends to follow this inflation measure when capping future increases. 
But ""intends"" is a key word here. Kasich did not favor writing the cap into law and lawmakers tabled an amendment that would have done so. Nichols said such language makes bond lawyers nervous. The bill also allows the state to lift the 10-year freeze on local E-ZPass tolls if ""necessary to comply with covenants in bond proceedings in existence before July 1, 2013."" 
Despite bond market concerns, the Turnpike Commission is expected to commit to the inflation cap in a resolution that will be introduced at a meeting this week, Nichols said. While that would have less authority than legislation, Nichols accurately noted that any future governor, General Assembly or turnpike regime could undo any of the Kasich administration’s measures. 
One last fact to consider. The 10-year freeze on short E-ZPass trips is not likely to benefit many turnpike motorists -- at least not to start. Only about 30 percent of the turnpike’s passenger car transactions come through the electronic payment system, according to KPMG. 
Kasich said his plan would ""make sure we have lower tolls than we had through the history of that turnpike."" Yes, the bill aims to keep tolls from rising faster than the pace of inflation -- a practice that would stand in contrast to KPMG’s findings from the past 20 years. And, yes, the bill freezes tolls for 10 years on a small, targeted cross-section of turnpike users. 
But not only are higher tolls a part of Kasich’s plan, they are integral to the concept. The increased revenue will allow the state to issue bonds to finance other projects. Furthermore, the inflation cap is not written into the law, and the state has an out from the local EZ-Pass freeze. 
Ohio Turnpike drivers might be getting a better deal than they were before. But future tolls that do not climb as quickly as they might have in the past are not lower tolls. It’s not only misleading but ridiculous for Kasich to portray it that way.

"['Georgia', 'Crime', 'Guns', 'B. Heath Mitchell']","
It takes a lot to live up to 'Mayberry'
","
The headline says it all: ""Moving to Nelson? Pack a gun."" 
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution ran that front-page story this month about the small town of Nelson, Ga, located 54 miles north of Atlanta. The story chronicled how the town’s council recently passed a law requiring the head of every household to own a gun and bullets. 
Local leaders say the law was meant as a security measure. But it also made a strong statement about possible federal gun restrictions. 
In discussing the town and his support of the new law, Nelson’s police chief, B. Heath Mitchell, noted that Nelson was a place full of good, law-abiding folks. In fact, ""we’re quieter than Mayberry,"" he said. 
OK, OK, the chief was using a bit of poetic license here. But since he compared his town to one of the best-known locales on the planet -- even if it is just a too-good-to-be-true TV town -- we thought we’d go ahead and give it a spin in the AJC Truth-O-Meter. PolitiFact Georgia decided to ""nip it, nip it in the bud"" once and for all. 
And anyway,  a fact check that requires watching episodes of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" is one we couldn’t pass up. 
Nelson has become a media magnet ever since the town passed the gun law. Requests for comment came from as far as Germany and the United Kingdom. Nationally, the story has been picked up by CNN, Fox News and the Huffington Post.  
Nelson’s new law is similar to a 1982 law passed in Kennesaw, Ga. Like Kennesaw, Nelson ultimately has no intention of enforcing the law, but hopes to send a message to possible criminals, council members said.  
""If you plan on doing us harm, we’ll be armed,"" said a Nelson city leader. 
We checked in with Chief Mitchell about crime in Nelson and its similarities to fictional Mayberry.  Nelson straddles the counties of Pickens and Cherokee, and was once home to a thriving marble industry. The city has produced marble for headstones at Arlington National Cemetery, and for building the Lincoln Memorial and the U.S. Capitol. 
Mitchell describes the city as a Norman Rockwell painting with so few crimes that the crime rate is too low to calculate. ""It’s quiet, just the way I like it,"" he said. 
In fact, Nelson is smaller than Mayberry. Nelson’s 2.5 square miles include a population of just 1,314 residents, according to the 2000 census. Mayberry’s population is 5,360, according to the opening scene of a sign posted at the railroad station in a Season 8 episode. 
The fictional Mayberry was said to be based on the actual town of Mount Airy, N.C., hometown of lead actor Andy Griffith. Griffith starred in the 1960s sitcom as the town’s sheriff, and Don Knotts played his bumbling deputy, Barney Fife. Andy didn’t carry a gun, and Barney was allowed just one bullet, which Andy made him carry in his shirt pocket as a safety precaution. 
In Nelson, Mitchell is the only lawman in town. When he takes a vacation, the job falls to the sheriff’s offices in Pickens and Cherokee counties. The town is budgeted for two more cops, Mitchell said, but they haven’t been hired yet. What crime Nelson does have is of the small-time variety, mainly burglaries. The last murder happened five years ago, and the suspect has fled to Mexico, according to the chief. 
Most of Nelson’s time is taken up with traffic control. 
Back in Mayberry, the crime report looks pretty similar. We watched a Season 2 episode, ""Sheriff Barney,"" for more information. In that episode, we find out that Mayberry has held the distinction of having the lowest crime rate in the state for three years running. In that episode, the major crime is said to be a resident operating an illegal moonshine still in the mountains. Andy and Barney have been looking for the still for weeks. Eventually the moonshiner, Rafe Hollister, comes to the jail and turns himself in, saying it was only a matter of time before Andy and Barney would catch him anyway. With that kind of self-policing, who needs guns. 
Actual crime numbers for the two towns are hard to find. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports only provide crime statistics on cities with populations over 100,000, so Nelson is not covered in this data, and the city doesn’t seem to have reported any data. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation only provides statewide crime rates, not those for local jurisdictions. As for unofficial data, real estate website Sperling’s Best Places gives Nelson a rank of 2 on a 1-to-10, lowest-to-highest scale for property and violent crime. The U.S. average for that website ranking is 4. 
Two other ""Andy Griffith Show"" episodes mention Mayberry’s low crime. One calls Mayberry the most crime-free town in the country, but there aren’t any episodes detailing offenses.  
PolitiFact Georgia did some checking to see if Nelson was on any list of the safest cities in America. 
Golly, nothing there. 
Plano, Texas, listed by Forbes as having the lowest crime rate in the nation, has a violent crime rate of 0.17 per 1,000 residents. Its population is about 262,000. The north Fulton municipality of Milton, listed as the nation’s 39th safest city on one website, averages one murder a year. 
Towns comparing themselves to Mayberry is nothing new, said Jim Clark, head of the 20,000-member ""Andy Griffith Show"" Rerun Watchers Club. ""People understand Mayberry as being the touchstone of wholesomeness with quiet, gentle life,"" Clark said. Even when the Vietnam War and racial tensions erupted in the real world, ""The Andy Griffith Show"" provided a place of escape with Mayberry where Opie (Andy’s TV son) was still doing kid things and Aunt Bee was making homemade apple pies. 
""But if you’ve got a low-crime town, you probably don’t need to arm every resident,"" Clark said. ""It doesn’t seem like a necessary thing to do for peacekeeping purposes."" 
So does Mitchell’s claim get renewed for another season? 
The Nelson police chief said his town was quieter than Mayberry. Both small towns have limited crime and a limited police presence. Nelson is such a small town that its crime statistics are not reported by the FBI or GBI; and ""The Andy Griffith Show"" didn’t detail crime stats. 
One major difference in the towns: Mayberry’s officers made a point of fighting crime with words, not guns. Andy didn’t even carry one. Nelson’s leaders opted for an entirely different style of governance by requiring each head of household to own a firearm and bullets.  
Many small cities with low crime, such as Nelson, liken themselves to Mayberry. But living up to the extremely high standards set by that fictitious town is almost impossible. 
We rated Mitchell’s claim Half True.

Bobby Scott says House budget ends Obamacare but keeps its taxes
","
U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-3rd, recently offered a scornful analysis of the federal budget proposal approved by the House of Representatives. 
In a March 25 radio interview, Scott directed much of his criticism at the author of the plan, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. ""He keeps all of the Obamacare taxes and spending cuts that paid for Obamacare, but then cuts all of the benefits,"" Scott said. 
We wondered whether Scott’s charge is accurate. 
First, a little background. Ryan is the House Budget Committee chairman and has long called for lower tax rates and reduced federal spending. Scott, a member of the panel, disagrees with the GOP’s approach. He supported an unsuccessful budget proposal by the Congressional Black Caucus last month that would have raised $2.7 trillion in new revenues over the next 10 years. 
Republicans muscled Ryan’s spending plan through the House on March 21. It would balance the budget in 10 years by substantially shrinking the government, privatizing Medicare and simplifying the tax code. Ryan’s budget, which also would end Obamacare, passed without a single supportive Democratic. 
The Senate, controlled by Democrats, passed a competing budget plan on March 23 that would raise taxes by $1 trillion over 10 years and leave Obamacare intact. No Republicans voted for the measure. 
Neither of the plans is likely to be enacted. Instead, they will serve as opening bargaining positions for the House and Senate as they enter budget negotiations. 
The budgets are based on 10-year revenue projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO is required to make its estimates on the assumption that current tax laws will remain  intact, including revenues that would generated by Obamacare, which was approved in 2010. 
So Scott is correct that Ryan, in writing the House budget, calls for the end of Obamacare but relies on revenue estimates that include Obamacare. 
The Affordable Care Act takes many steps to raise revenues. The biggest ones are cutting in half the maximum amount of money employees can put in nontaxable health savings accounts, penalizing companies with more than 50 employees that don’t provide health insurance and imposing an excise tax on high-premium insurance plans. 
If Obamacare is repealed, the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation have estimated that revenues would decrease by $1 trillion over 10 years.   
Now, here’s where things get fuzzy. Ryan and other House GOP leaders say they want to eliminate the Obamacare taxes. Their budget also calls for a revenue-neutral overhaul of the tax system. They want to reduce the number of individual tax brackets and cut top tax rates. They say they would pay for all these reductions by eliminating the alternative minimum tax and getting rid of many loopholes and deductions. 
But the Ryan budget does not name even one loophole or deduction it would axe to pay for reducing rates and make up for $1 trillion in lost Obamacare revenue. That work would be left to the House Ways and Means Committee. 
Cutting tax breaks would be a sensitive job. The largest breaks to individuals are not having to pay income taxes on their employers’ contributions to their health care plans and pensions, and the mortgage interest deduction. 
Ryan has had some criticism from the right --  including the Heritage Foundation and Rep. Paul Broun, R-Ga. -- for keeping the $1 trillion that equates to Obamacare taxes in his budget. 
""These tax hikes are the oxygen that fuels the fire of ever bigger spending,"" the Heritage Foundation wrote. 
Our ruling 
Scott said the House budget ""keeps the Obamacare taxes and spending cuts that paid for Obamacare, but then cuts all of the benefits."" 
There’s no doubt the GOP plan would eliminate the Affordable Care Act. But the tax part of Scott’s claim has a bit of complexity. 
The House budget is based on revenue projections that assume Obamacare taxes will continue. What Scott didn’t say is that the plan calls for replacing the Obamacare levies with revenues that would come from reducing income tax breaks. We can’t entirely fault Scott for the omission, however, because the House budget doesn’t identify any tax breaks that would be pared -- it merely assigns that crucial work to a committee. 
So Scott’s statement is accurate, but needs some clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C473DC0>],/factchecks/2013/apr/08/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-says-house-budget-ends-obamacare-keeps/

Rhode Island TV reporter Jim Taricani says 38 Studios bond offer promised anonymity for buyers
","
One of the questions swirling around the collapse of 38 Studios is whether the state should be on the hook for the millions of dollars in bond money that it raised on behalf of the now-bankrupt video game developer, headed by former Red Sox star Curt Schilling.

During the March 24, 2013, edition of ""10 News Conference,"" co-host Jim Taricani posed that question to two members of the General Assembly, and then, as an aside, said: ""No one knows who bought the bonds. And there was some language put in the bond offer that they must remain anonymous.""

Taricani said Rhode Islanders might feel differently about paying back the moral obligation bonds if the identities of the purchasers were known.

The bonds

The bonds were sold in November 2010 under the auspices of the Rhode Island Loan Guaranty Fund, after being approved earlier that year by the General Assembly and then-Gov. Donald Carcieri. The bonds were underwritten by Wells Fargo Securities and Barclays Capital, according to information provided at the time by Robert I. Stolzman, lawyer for the Economic Development Corporation.

The bonds, according to the EDC, were sold in three blocks totaling $75 million and paid interest ranging from 6 percent to 7.75 percent annually.

At the time, the EDC said about a dozen investors privately purchased the bonds. The purchasers included insurers, asset managers and a community bank. No names were given.

The bondholders

The first part of Taricani’s comment was a bit of hyperbole. Clearly some people know who bought the bonds -- those who sold them and those who purchased them.

However, it is true that the identities of the bondholders were never made public. The Journal has been trying for some time to identify them.

On May 30, 2012, the paper requested a list of bondholders from the Economic Development Corporation. A month and a half later, Allison Lane, a lawyer for the EDC, responded that the commission ""does not have any documents that contain the names and other identifying information of any bondholders or any other information as to who bonds have been sold and or transferred.""

But when PolitiFact reviewed the bond offer, which runs a whopping 233 pages, it discovered this requirement on Page 40 of the file: ""Each purchaser of the 2010 Bonds will be required to execute and deliver an Investor Letter substantially in the form attached hereto as Appendix E upon delivery and acceptance of the 2010 Bonds.""

The letters were designed to ensure the investors were experienced, knew what they were getting into and were ""able to withstand without material injury a complete loss"" of their investment.

The statement is signed by Keith Stokes, who was economic development director until he was replaced after 38 Studios defaulted.

Appendix E indicates that the letters should go to no fewer than 10 entities, including two securities firms, five law firms, 38 Studios and the state (with no department specified).

Most  importantly, one copy of each letter -- which would indicate who purchased the bonds -- was supposed to go to the EDC. Yet EDC lawyer Allison Lane, in her letter, had said the EDC had no such documents.

PolitiFact Rhode Island spent more than a week contacting some of the law firms and the EDC trying to find out about the investor letters. Phone calls and e-mails were not returned by Moses and Afonso Ltd., the company that served as a bond counsel to the EDC; First Southwest Company, which was the financial adviser to the EDC; and Pannone Lopes Devereaux & West, the law firm involved in placement of the bonds.

More than a week after seeking information from the EDC's current lawyer, Thomas E. Carlotto, the EDC e-mailed us a one-paragraph statement from him saying it had not received the investor letters ""as anticipated.""

He blamed ""the former executive management and former counsel to the RIEDC [which] should have taken measures in November 2010 to ensure receipt of such investor letters"" to show that the placement agents, Wells Fargo Securities and Barclays Capital, had followed the requirements.

Repeated attempts to subsequently interview Carlotto were unsuccessful.

Christine Hunsinger, spokeswoman for Gov. Lincoln Chafee, who became chairman of the EDC when he took office two months after the bonds were sold, said EDC lawyers are now exploring whether those letters can be found.

""It's yet another mess in the 38 Studios matter that, unfortunately, this governor has been left to clean up,"" Hunsinger said.

So when Taricani stated, ""No one knows who bought the bonds,"" aside from the sellers and buyers, he was right.

Anonymity guaranteed?

And what about Taricani's statement that anonymity was guaranteed in the bond offering?

We searched that document for references to anonymity, requirements for disclosure or promises to protect a buyer's identity. We came up blank.

We contacted Taricani in hopes that he could direct us to the restriction he was talking about.

""My info came from two different people who have, in my opinion, knowledge of that bond issue,"" he told us in an e-mail. ""If there is no specific language in that document about anonymity, I then misspoke and sincerely apologize for the misstatement.""

Our ruling

Jim Taricani said, ""No one knows who bought the [38 Studios] bonds. And there was some language put in the bond offer that they must remain anonymous.""

The first half of his statement appears to be correct. Although SOMEONE must have a record of who bought the bonds, the EDC, following inquiries by The Journal about the investment letters, now says it did not receive the documents required under the sale, and it is trying to get them.

Regarding the other half of Taricani's statement, we could find no language guaranteeing the purchasers that their names would be kept secret.

We rate his statement Half True.

Gov. Scott Walker says choice schools would get only half as much as public schools even after the aid increases in his budget
","
Stumping for his proposal to expand school choice as an ""alternative to failing schools,"" Gov. Scott Walker threw down a challenge to what he called five common myths about choice. 
Under the heading, ""Myth #1"", Walker said in a March 22, 2013 news release: ""Choice schools are getting more money than public schools."" 
""Not even close,"" the release continued. ""Public schools in Wisconsin receive, on average, $12,775 per pupil in total funds. Under Gov. Walker’s budget, choice schools will get about half of that per student."" 
A flashpoint in Walker’s proposed two-year budget would boost per-pupil state aid to some choice schools by 9.4 percent in 2014-’15. Others would see payments boosted by 21.9 percent. Overall public school revenues, by contrast, would be frozen. 
Can it be true that even after those increases, choice schools still would get about half what public schools get in funds per pupil? 
Let’s check the numbers. 
For the public schools, Walker got the $12,775 revenue figure from the latest available U.S. Census report on public education finance. It reflects primarily state aid to schools, local property taxes, and federal funding. 
But that report covers 2009-’10, before Walker cut education aid and limited what schools could raise in property taxes. 
A more recent such tally, by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, put the figure somewhat lower, at $12,376 for 2011-’12. 
What’s the comparison figure? 
For the choice schools, Walker did not mention a figure, but the numbers are readily available in his budget proposal. He would increase state aid to kindergarten-through-eighth-grade voucher schools to $7,050 per pupil (up from the current $6,442) in the 2014-'15 school year, theJournal Sentinel reported.  
For voucher high schools, the per-pupil aid would rise to $7,856. 
There are mismatches galore in the comparison years here, but we can still draw some conclusions. 
If we assume that total revenues for public schools hold at the 2012 level, the choice schools would be getting 57 to 63 percent of what public schools get, depending on whether they are a K-8 or high school. And if we assume revenues hold at the 2010 number Walker cited, it’s 55 to 61 percent. 
So, pretty close to ""about half"" for the K-8 choice schools -- but much closer to two-thirds for the high schools. 
There are other caveats regarding Walker’s methodology. 
The public school revenue figure he used is accurate, and it has the virtue of being comprehensive in pulling in the three major funding sources. The Census data is widely cited. 
""What the governor said is an accurate reflection of the cost to the average resident,"" his spokesman, Cullen Werwie, told us. 
But there are flaws inherent in this approach because he’s comparing two different types of funding systems. 
Every researcher we consulted warned that comparisons between public and choice school funding can produce different conclusions depending on how the comparisons are set up. 
In this case, the broad revenue figure Walker mentions for public schools includes sources that also help choice schools -- but are not reflected in the choice-school number. Left out on the choice side of the equation, for example, is what choice schools collect in fees from parents for a whole range of school-related items. 
It’s also worth noting that some federal dollars that flow, for example, through Milwaukee Public Schools actually go toward helping transport and support choice students. So the funds show up as revenue to MPS even though a portion is essentially in-kind revenue for choice schools. 
So it’s an apples to oranges comparison to some extent, though precisely how much is unknown because we don’t have budget details for private schools. 
""Only with comparable expense data could we more definitively get at this,"" said education researcher Anneliese Dickman, research director at the Public Policy Forum in Milwaukee. 
There’s no way now to make the comparison perfect, but one preferred method would be comparing the choice payment to what public schools get from local property taxes and general state aids, we heard from researchers or other officials at DPI, the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance and School Choice Wisconsin. 
By that counting method, choice funding would be within 75 percent of the public school level. Another method would put the choice funding in between the Walker method and this one. 
Last point. 
Milwaukee provides by far the most students in the choice program, and there’s only one other city included right now, Racine. 
So, it’s ""somewhat misleading"" to compare the choice payments in Milwaukee to a state (public school) average, said Dale Knapp, research director at the Taxpayers Alliance, a research organization. 
Using the method we heard was preferred (counting local property taxes and general aids), choice in Milwaukee would be at 70 to 80 percent of the Milwaukee Public Schools number. Under Walker’s method, city choice schools would get half or very close to half of what their public counterparts receive. 
Our rating 
Walker said that even after the aid increases in his proposed budget, choice schools would be getting ""about half"" the per-pupil funds that public schools receive. 
He’s pretty close for some schools but not others based on his method of comparison, but off considerably based on a method preferred by researchers as a more accurate comparison. On the Truth-O-Meter, there’s a spot for claims that are partially accurate but leave out important details or takes things out of context. 
That’s Half True. And we think it fits here.",[<zip object at 0x000002809735CE80>],/factchecks/2013/apr/07/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-choice-schools-would-get-onl/

NJ Sierra Club director claims AshBritt had dirty cleanup record in New Orleans after Katrina
","
The company handling disposal of Hurricane Sandy debris here has a rather dirty history from the work it did along the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina, according to the director of the Sierra Club New Jersey chapter. 
  
The company, AshBritt, left new contaminated sites in its wake as it did cleanup along the Gulf Coast after 2005’s Hurricane Katrina, Jeff Tittel said in a Feb. 22 opinion column he wrote for NJToday.net. 
  
""A report by the US General (Government) Accountability Office (GAO) in 2008 found that the disposal of Katrina wastes by AshBritt in the south resulted in the creation of contaminated sites along the Gulf Coast and two new Superfund sites in New Orleans,"" Tittel wrote in his column, which explored links between Hurricane Sandy and climate change. 
  
This claim caught our eye since AshBritt received a no-bid contract from New Jersey to handle the bulk of the Hurricane Sandy cleanup. Even more eye-catching? The nearly 40-page GAO report cited by Tittel not only never mentions AshBritt, it looks only at debris disposal in the New Orleans area. 
  
Let’s first review some background about how Florida-based AshBritt came to New Jersey. 
  
Hurricane Sandy slammed New Jersey on Oct. 29, 2012, causing widespread damage here, in New York and Connecticut. Hours after the storm, Gov. Chris Christie awarded AshBritt a no-bid contract that piggybacked off one the company had with Connecticut. The decision has drawn public scrutiny for a variety of reasons, such as higher-than-usual disposal costs to towns for which AshBritt has handled debris disposal. 
  
Now let’s get into Tittel’s claim about that GAO report. 
  
AshBritt general counsel Jared Moskowitz called Tittel’s claim about the company’s role in New Orleans and Louisiana ""hocus pocus."" 
  
Moskowitz said AshBritt was only in Louisiana for a couple of weeks after Katrina before the Army Corps of Engineers moved them to do debris removal work in Mississippi. 
  
""We weren’t in New Orleans and Louisiana long enough to create a Superfund site,"" Moskowitz told us. ""It is a lie."" 
  
The Army Corps of Engineers confirmed that AshBritt worked briefly in New Orleans before moving east to Mississippi. 
  
We also checked with the GAO about AshBritt’s alleged role, and the agency confirmed that neither AshBritt nor any other disposal company was referenced in their report. The GAO is the investigative arm of Congress. 
  
""We did not look at contractors at all, in fact,"" said Alfredo Gomez, a GAO spokesman. ""We looked at federal agencies and Louisiana agencies. Contractors are outside the scope of our work."" 
  
The report notes disposal violations at several New Orleans-area landfills, but doesn’t reference the ""Gulf Coast,"" as Tittel does, and details how the state dealt with those violations. 
  
Tittel said the purpose of his column was to point out debris disposal problems that occurred after Katrina and to ensure that New Jersey has strong oversight of Hurricane Sandy debris removal and the contractors doing the work. 
  
""The lesson that we saw in the Gulf was when you privatize things and you don’t have clear oversight and enforcement in place, you end up having a lot of mistakes,"" he said. 
  
Finally, let’s look at the rest of Tittel’s claim. 
  
We reviewed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Priorities List of Superfund sites in three Gulf Coast states hit hard by Katrina: Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. None of 31 sites listed referenced Katrina, including two in New Orleans: the Old Gentilly Landfill and the Agriculture Street Landfill. 
  
""The Agriculture Street site did not receive any debris from Katrina,"" said EPA Region 6 spokeswoman Jennah Durant. ""No new National Priority List (NPL) sites were created in New Orleans as a result of post-Katrina clean-up."" 
  
Our ruling 
  
Tittel said in an opinion column, ""A report by the US General Accountability Office (GAO) in 2008 found that the disposal of Katrina wastes by AshBritt in the south resulted in the creation of contaminated sites along the Gulf Coast and two new Superfund sites in New Orleans."" 
  
There are several major problems with Tittel’s claim. First, neither AshBritt nor any other contractor is named in the report. Second, the GAO confirmed that contractors were not part of their study. Third, the Army Corps of Engineers confirmed that AshBritt was not the major contractor in New Orleans - the company was moved to Mississippi shortly after Katrina cleanup started. Fourth, the report’s scope is limited to existing landfills in the New Orleans area – not new contamination sites or ""the Gulf Coast."" Fifth, the EPA has confirmed that post-Katrina debris did not cause new Superfund sites in New Orleans. At least five falsehoods in one claim? That’s beyond ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

"['Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Virginia', 'Dave Marsden']","
Marsden says Massachusetts health reforms lowered state's death rate
","State Sen. Dave Marsden says expanding Medicaid in Virginia will save lives. And he points to Massachusetts’ experience as proof. ""When Massachusetts got health care, their mortality rate went down either 2.9 or 3.9 percent -- whatever -- but it saved lives,"" Marsden, D-Fairfax, said during a June 18 radio interview. Marsden’s comments, made on the John Fredericks Show, came amid fiery partisan debate over whether to expand Medicaid eligibility to as many as 400,000 low-income and disabled Virginians. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, Uncle Sam would pay the entire tab through 2016 and 90 percent of added cost down the road. On June 12, the Republican-led General Assembly passed a two-year state budget designed to close Democratic routes toward expansion. We found Marsden’s comment interesting and wondered whether whether the death rate in Massachusetts really did fall by at least 2.9 percent after then-Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, signed a health reform bill in 2006 that expanded Medicaid and mandated individual health care coverage. Brent McKenzie, Marsden’s legislative assistant, said the statement was based on a study by  the Harvard School of Public Health that was published in May 2014 in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Researchers examined the death rates in Massachusetts counties before and after the reforms were enacted, looking at the periods from 2001-2005 and 2007-2010. They concluded that the death rate per 100,000 people aged 20 to 64 dropped dropped 3.2 percent during the years after the reforms. The data was compared to statistics of people in the same age group from 531 counties in 46 states that had not undergone coverage expansions. The researchers concluded that the decline in Massachusetts was 2.9 percent greater than the average of the U.S. counties that had not expanded coverage. ""What we found in Massachusetts after reform was a significant reduction in deaths from the kinds of illnesses where we expect health care to have the biggest impact, including infections, cancer and cardiovascular disease,"" Benjamin Sommers, an assistant professor of health policy at Harvard and a report co-author, said in a news release announcing the results. The study also found the largest death rate drops occurred in Massachusetts counties that had low insurance coverage prior to the reforms. A key advantage of the Harvard study was its size -- examining an estimated 270,000 Massachusetts adults gained insurance through the reform. Although the study found a correlation between health care coverage and lower death rates, there’s on-going debate over whether the reforms caused that result. The Harvard School of Public Health report estimated that state’s mandatory insurance laws prevented about 320 deaths a year. But researchers cautioned that they couldn’t definitively ""establish cause and effect"" between the lowered death rate and the reforms. They also noted that the results in Massachusetts ""may not generalize to other states."" ""We find significant reduction in mortality among nonelderly adults in Massachusetts since its 2006 reform relative to a control group in counties of similar counties in states without such reforms,"" the report says. ""Although this analysis cannot demonstrate causality, the results offer suggestive evidence that the Affordable Care Act -- modeled after the Massachusetts law -- may impact not only coverage and access but also mortality."" An article in the New York Times said health economists viewed the report as strong evidence that the Massachusetts’ health care overhaul had saved lives, but noted experts also said the study ""will not settle the long-debated question on whether being insured prolongs life."" Some analysts quoted in The Times and in a Boston Globe article said the results add to a body of research showing health care coverage extends lives. But skeptics questioned whether the death rate drop found in the study would occur so quickly after the Massachusetts reforms took root. The Harvard report notes other studies have looked at the effect of health insurance on mortality and the results have been mixed. A 2012 report in the New England Journal of Medicine found that several states that expanded their Medicaid eligibility programs before Obamacare passed in 2010 saw ""significant decreases in mortality."" The researchers noted, however, that they ""cannot definitively show causality."" In contrast, a 2011 study of Medicaid expansion in Oregon did not find a link between health insurance and death rates. A 2013 follow-up study found that the state’s Medicaid expansion led to better mental health and lower financial strain among beneficiaries, but researchers did not find improvement in important physical attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Our ruling Marsden said that after Massachusetts enacted its sweeping health care reform in 2006, its mortality rate dropped by at least 2.9 percent, ""saving lives."" His statement correctly summarizes a recent study finding the state’s death rate dropped by 3.2 percent among 20-64 year-olds. The decline was 2.9 percent greater than the average of a comparison group of 531 counties across the nation. But Marsden reaches a little when he says the results proved the health reforms ""saved lives."" Researchers believe that’s the case, but caution they could not establish a ""cause and effect"" between the lowered death rate and the health reforms. So Marsden’s statement is accurate, but needs a little clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D0EE80>],/factchecks/2014/jun/27/dave-marsden/marsden-says-massachusetts-health-reforms-lowered-/

Mary Burke says Wisconsin spends more on corrections than on higher education
","The state has historically made higher education one of its top budget priorities, along with K-12 education and aid to local governments. But have prisons jumped ahead of higher education? That’s what Democratic gubernatorial challenger Mary Burke claims. ""Part of the increase in the cost (of higher education) has been because state support has dropped,"" she said in a June 2, 2014 discussion with the Fond du Lac Reporter’s editorial board. ""We now spend, under Governor Walker, more on corrections than we do on higher education."" Burke’s claim really has two parts. First, that state support for higher education has dropped, which has resulted in a greater cost to students. Second, that thanks to Walker’s budgets, we are now spending more on corrections than higher education. Is she right? Education spending At a time when college-trained workers are in high demand, the UW System often feels the heat of state budget cuts. When asked for backup, Burke spokesman Joe Zepecki pointed to the state budget, which shows state support for the UW System has dropped in each of the last three budget cycles to 18.99% of the state’s 2013-15 budget. In raw numbers, the state spent $2.273 billion on the UW System before Walker took office and spent $2.247 billion in the 2013-2015 budget. That is a drop of about $26 million. Adding to the squeeze: The UW System’s enrollment rose by 10 percent in the past decade, while the system’s share of state appropriations shrank, according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis from August 16, 2012. It’s part of a national trend. ""Budget-strapped states have had to cut what they spend on higher education,"" said a study released by the College Board in 2013. The report said total state appropriations for public universities have fallen by 19 percent nationwide since 2007. So, state support is down. But have costs to Wisconsin students gone up as a result, as Burke claimed? In the past three budgets, tuition increased annually by 5.5 percent from 2007-2012. That is the maximum allowed under state caps that regulate increases. For the 2011-12 academic year, this meant a tuition hike of $422 at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and $681 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In 2012, Gov. Scott Walker launched a systemwide tuition freeze. He extended this freeze to last through the 2015-16 academic year based on projections that the UW System would end 2014 with more than $1.7 billion on hand in reserves. While tuition remains frozen, the Board of Regents in June 2014 hiked student segregated fees by an average of $39 per student and raised the the average cost of housing by $178. Its budget also called for increasing spending by 1.7 percent for the 2014-15 academic year. Tuition freezes are not a sustainable solution to the problem, said Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. ""In a sense, today’s students are being given tuition freezes because prior students got tuition increases,"" Berry said. Sinking state support also makes public universities rely more on tuition, fundraising fees, and other revenue sources to cover more of their costs. But these sources can’t cover it all, so this has lead to a strained reliance on them.   So students’ families end up with more of the cost, since state and federal aid to students has dried up considerably since 2009-10, according to the College Board study’s co-author Sandy Baum. There is a similar picture when you consider the state’s technical colleges. Since Walker took office, state spending for tech colleges fell by $65 million to $221 million. But they will get a $5 million bump in support for their 2014-15 academic year. Given all this, Burke is essentially on target on this part of the claim. Corrections vs. higher education Now, let’s take a look at the second part. Burke cites the state’s 2013-15 budget as her source for saying that state corrections spending now trumps state support for higher ed. The budget documents show $2.315 billion in state appropriations to corrections, and $68 million less, or $2.247 billion, to the UW System. It was in Walker’s first budget, covering 2011-13, that the lines crossed. This chart shows the recent trend: Budget UW System appropriations (GPR) UW System percentage of total GPR expenditures Corrections appropriations (GPR) Corrections percentage of total GPR expenditures 2003-2005 1,908,506,300 8.51% 1,702,971,700 7.59% 2005-2007 1,930,780,800 7.49% 1,802,134,800 6.99% 2007-2009 2,237,870,400 8.03% 2,167,424,300 7.78% 2009-2011 2,273,309,900 8.215% 2,252,212,400 8.139% 2011-2013 2,095,251,600 7.218% 2,250,923,800 7.754% 2013-2015 2,247,320,900 7.398% $2,315,095,600 7.621% The 2011 Journal Sentinel story that examined more than 20 years of budgets found this trend has been in the works regardless of which party was in charge of state government, through policy changes and shifts in budget priorities. Changes in sentencing and correctional policy launched in the 1980s led to the state’s rising prison population in the 1990s as more and more prisons were being built, the Journal Sentinel story found. Since 1990, state spending on corrections grew by 620%, without inflation. Spending tapered off in 2012 and has been mostly flat in the last decade, Berry said. The state’s inmate population also grew in the past 20 years -- from about 7,000 to 22,000 inmates. This requires more personnel costs to guard, feed, and provide medical care to them so it will be difficult to cut state spending on corrections anytime soon, the Journal Sentinel story notes. One last point. The higher education vs. corrections comparison Burke does not include state spending on technical colleges and the Higher Education Aids Board, the board which runs students’ financial aid. Together, they add another $512.7 million to the higher education tab in the 2013-’15 budget. When the tech colleges and aid board are included, corrections no longer comes out on top. The state still spends slightly more on higher education than corrections when those items are included. Our rating Burke said that ""Part of the increase in the cost (of higher education) has been because state support has dropped. We now spend, under Governor Walker, more on corrections than we do on higher education."" The first part of Burke’s claim is on target. The drop in state support for higher education -- even with the recent tuition freeze -- has meant increased costs for the students. The lines crossed between corrections and the UW System during Walker’s time in office. But the trend had been heading in that direction for years so the blame does not fall squarely on Walker. What’s more, when spending on technical colleges is considered, the lines have not yet crossed. We rate Burke’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096CF6780>],/factchecks/2014/jun/27/mary-burke/citing-scott-walker-mary-burke-says-wisconsin-spen/
"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Washington Examiner']","
Nunn cautious, but not mum on Obamacare
","Michelle Nunn has kept a mostly low profile during this year's primary election season, correctly gauging that she had the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate sewn up. Her pre-primary television ads were upbeat, talking about her work with former President George H.W. Bush’s Points of Life Foundation and even life lessons she learned from her grandma. That has left GOP operatives and political pundits to pore over her every statement, and they have. They’ve been particularly eager to pin her down on the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which Republicans know is a polarizing issue. The Washington Examiner on June 9 wrote that Nunn has avoided addressing the Affordable Care Act. It’s a strategy that’s also gleaned attention from The Washington Post, The New Republic, The Associated Press and others. PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look at whether Nunn can be accused of dodging and weaving on the ACA. Nunn, the daughter of former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, easily defeated three challengers in the May 20 Democratic primary. She has received national funding from Democrats, who hope to win a seat in what is still a mostly conservative state controlled by Republicans. In November, she will face either U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston or businessman David Perdue, who are in the GOP’s July 22 runoff. Our first step was to determine what Nunn has said publicly. Nunn has said multiple times that she doesn’t support repealing the ACA. She's embraced the widely viewed positives of the law: coverage for pre-existing conditions and expansion of parents’ health care coverage to children to age 26. She also has identified specific problems in the law -- namely that premium rates aren't always affordable and that families are sometimes given less choice concerning their insurance plans. Her stance is clear on this point: Georgia and Gov. Nathan Deal should have accepted Medicaid expansion under the ACA. Where the pundits say she’s been evasive is on the question of whether she would have voted for the ACA in 2010. Some would say she has dodged that question like Floyd Mayweather weaving away from a right hook. ""At the time the Affordable Health Care Act was passed, I was working for Points of Light. I wish we had more people who had tried to architect a resolution,"" Nunn said to an MSNBC reporter in May. ""I think it’s impossible to look back retrospectively and say, ‘What would you have done when you were there?’ "" She was later zinged by MSNBC News Chief Chuck Todd for those comments. ""It just doesn’t come across as credible,"" Todd said of her statement. ""Nothing screamed practiced politician like that answer."" A quick look at the ""Ideas"" section of her campaign website shows no mention of health care. Her campaign links to a few news articles that mention the law, but none of her press releases or news links mention it in their headlines. That’s in stark contrast to the other two candidates, who both list ""Repeal Obamacare"" prominently on their campaign websites. During a primary debate in Cobb County, Perdue called the ACA ""the worst thing in American history legislatively."" Kingston says the law ""has been a failure."" Nationally, the ACA has been a political quagmire for candidates. Do they fall with the vocal critics? Or do they stand with the law of the land? And that’s arguably an even tougher call in Georgia, where 50.8 percent of residents still oppose the law and 45.2 percent support it, according to the 2014 Georgia State of the State poll. We asked Kyle Kondick, the managing editor for the University of Virginia Center for Politics’ Crystal Ball blog, for his take. ""The state, in many ways, determines the messaging,"" Kondick said. ""It’s no surprise to me that she’s dodging that question."" The typical strategy for Democrats in red states, such as Georgia, is to depict themselves as middle-of-the-road candidates while painting other candidates as unlikable, Kondick said. That might work for Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat also running for the Senate and facing a similar challenge on whether to support or denounce the controversial law. She faces a Kentucky electorate that is not as diverse as Georgia’s, and her response has been to remain quiet on the issue. But in Georgia, there are still a lot of Democratic and minority voters, which means Nunn can’t stray too far right. ""You can’t run exclusively like a Republican because how are people going to come out and vote for you?"" Kondick said. ""You’re threading the needle."" Nunn deflects the hypothetical questions – after all, she wasn’t in Congress to vote for or against passage of the ACA. Instead, she makes generic accusations of dysfunction among legislators. ""Folks in Washington need to stop playing political games and come together and fix what's wrong with the law, and preserve the parts that are working,"" Nunn said in a statement to Healthcare Georgia, forwarded to PolitiFact by her campaign. But has Nunn done ""cartwheels"" (gone of out her way) to avoid taking a stand on the controversial law? Nunn doesn’t prominently discuss health care on her website or in her stump speeches, despite its wide-ranging implications for the state. She refuses to say how she would have voted when Congress passed the ACA in 2010, but unlike her opponents, she said she would not vote to repeal the law. While she does list some of the problems with the law, she has yet to propose specific solutions on her website or in person. Nunn has been evasive on some aspects of Obamacare but has been very specific on other areas, such as Medicaid expansion. We rate the overall statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097573180>],/factchecks/2014/jun/27/washington-examiner/nunn-cautious-not-mum-obamacare/

Rick Scott says gubernatorial candidates 'routinely disclose' spouses' tax returns
","A new ad by Gov. Rick Scott’s campaign has a simple message: Scott and his wife Ann have shown Florida their tax returns, so it’s only fair that former Gov. Charlie Crist and wife Carole show theirs. In the ad released June 25 called ""What’s He Hiding,"" Scott’s political group Let’s Get To Work demands that Crist release not only his tax returns, but Carole’s, too. The ad says the Scotts have released tax returns both in 2010 and for this year’s election. ""But millionaire Charlie Crist refuses to release his spouse’s tax returns,"" the ad says. ""Candidates for governor routinely disclose those returns. Alex Sink and Rick Scott both did it four years ago."" Crist has said he won’t be releasing his wife’s tax returns, saying Scott was ""out of bounds"" for making the request and should apologize. PolitiFact Florida wondered, however, if spouses truly do ""routinely disclose"" their tax returns. Here’s our disclosure: It depends on what you consider routine. A separate issue The practice of gubernatorial candidates themselves disclosing tax returns goes back a long time, but for this check we’ll head as far back as Reubin Askew, who became governor in 1971 and released several years’ worth. Florida elected officials are required by law to file an annual statement showing their assets and liabilities. They are not required to release tax returns, but candidates for governor have traditionally done so. We should note that this generally applies to the general election candidates, and not always primary candidates. For example, Bill McCollum did not release his returns in 2010 while running in the primary against Rick Scott. As to whether spouses fess up their finances, well, that’s an interesting history. Most candidates have filed jointly with their spouses. Jeb Bush and his wife Columba released several years’ worth of joint returns during Bush’s years in office, and Rick and Ann Scott filed jointly. It wasn’t until 2002, when Democrat Bill McBride ran against Bush, that the issue of a spouse filing separately came up. McBride’s wife, Alex Sink, began to file separately from her husband specifically because her husband was running for governor, but in 2002 she released two years of tax returns under pressure from the Bush campaign. Sink had retired as president of Bank of America’s Florida operations in 2000. McBride, a lawyer who worked at Tampa firm Holland & Knight for many years, returned the favor in 2010 and released his returns when his wife ran for governor against Rick Scott (McBride died in 2012). Crist was a solo filer when he ran for governor in 2006, because he was single. He didn’t marry Carole Crist until 2008. He has said they continue to file separately because he ""was a single guy for a long time. She's got her own business, and it's her business."" Carole Crist is an owner of a family Halloween costume and novelty business, Franco-American Novelty Co., and has created a second company, Goddessey. Crist, a lawyer by trade like McBride, announced the release of three years of tax returns as the ad began airing. The next day, he released returns going back to 2001, with promises to release more, going back to 1991. Candidates releasing their spouses separate returns has become more of an issue in the last couple of decades as more women become entrepreneurs independently of their spouses. Susan McManus, a University of South Florida political science professor, says the expectation of disclosing separate returns really took off when Walter Mondale chose Geraldine Ferraro as his Democratic running mate during the 1984 presidential campaign. Ferraro faced many questions from political opponents and the media about her husband John Zaccaro’s real estate company. They ultimately released the returns, and Ferraro admitted she was an officer in the company, albeit without the authority to sign company checks. In recent years the same expectation has come up in presidential campaigns; Sen. John McCain’s millionaire wife Cindy eventually released two years of individual tax returns during the 2008 presidential campaign amid Democratic pressure.   But those are examples from presidential politics. In Florida, the question is whether two instances -- by the same couple, in McBride and Sink -- over the last 12 years constitutes spouses’ tax returns being released ""routinely,"" as Scott alleges. It’s only recently that we’ve seen candidates’ spouses filing separate returns. How you feel about it as a voter likely depends on how you feel about the race and the candidates, McManus said. ""The interesting thing in this case is that attitudes about this are changing,"" she said. ""In the future we’re likely to see everyone routinely releasing everything."" Our ruling Scott said ""candidates for governor routinely disclose"" spouses’ tax returns. It is routine when candidates file joint returns with their spouses. It’s only recently that gubernatorial candidates and their spouses have started filing separate tax returns, though. When spouses file separately, there are two instances to look to, when first Alex Sink and then her husband Bill McBride disclosed individual returns for their spouse’s respective gubernatorial runs in 2002 and 2010. So the trend of spouses who file separately is a new one, but one way or the other, spouses' returns have been released over the years. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972B8200>],/factchecks/2014/jun/26/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-gubernatorial-candidates-routinely/

John Boehner says Keystone XL pipeline would create 100,000 jobs
","President Barack Obama often emphasizes an all-of-the-above approach to U.S. energy production that includes a mix of natural resources and new, greener technologies. But House Speaker John Boehner says it's Republicans, not the Democratic administration, that are truly committed to achieving America’s energy independence through a diverse portfolio. In an op-ed for USA Today, Boehner said that Obama’s new carbon restrictions will hurt existing coal plants, while Democrats are standing in the way of House efforts to ease rules on excavating and exporting American natural gas. The White House is also blocking the Keystone XL pipeline, which Republicans — and some Democrats — continue to support. ""The nearly six-year delay in approving Keystone is costing Americans more than 100,000 jobs and nearly a million barrels of oil a day,"" Boehner wrote. The House has passed a bill that would fast-track the pipeline. We’ve taken a number of looks at claims about the economic impact of the 1,179-mile Keystone XL pipeline, a project that would connect diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then Gulf Coast refineries. But Boehner’s estimate of 100,000 jobs was so far above anything we’ve checked in the past, we wondered if new information had surfaced. We asked Boehner’s office for supporting evidence. They pointed us to the website of an August 2011 press release from TransCanada Corporation, the company jockeying to build the Keystone XL pipeline. The release says ""independent studies"" estimate that the pipeline will create 20,000 direct jobs — 13,000 construction and 7,000 manufacturing — and ""an additional 118,000 total spin-off jobs."" We talked to TransCanada. At the time, they were referring to a study by the Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm they hired. But TransCanada spokesman Davis Sheremata told PolitiFact that the study is ""no longer relevant."" Why? ""In this case, the referenced report dealt with Keystone XL as it was proposed in 2008,"" Sheremata said. ""The project has changed considerably since then, including substantial route changes and a new presidential permit application."" The Perryman Group analysis has been removed from TransCanada’s website and links to the study don’t work. There were other important caveats with the Perryman study even before it was discarded by TransCanada. Most notably, the 13,000 construction jobs the pipeline would supposedly create were calculated per person, per year. That means that if the job lasted two years, 6,500 people would be employed each year. A study by Cornell University Global Labor Institute into the Keystone pipeline also said that the Perryman Group report is ""flawed"" because it ""wrongly includes over $1 billion in spending and over 10,000 person-years of employment for a section of the Keystone project in Kansas and Oklahoma that is not part of Keystone XL and has already been built."" So Boehner was citing a 2011 study that was criticized and has since been scrubbed from the website of the people who commissioned it. But are there other credible estimates? The study most often cited is the analysis from the State Department, which is in charge of reviewing the Keystone XL pipeline for the administration. It found that the pipeline itself would directly create 3,900 construction jobs — 1,950 if the project took two years. In all, about 42,100 jobs would be created over the course of the project. This includes jobs created directly by the pipeline (like the construction work), indirectly (like jobs created as a result of goods and services purchased by construction crews) and induced (jobs created by workers spending their wages in the economy). When we asked TransCanada for a more recent study into the job creation potential of the Keystone pipeline, the company quoted figures from the State Department study. As we’ve noted in the past, though, most of these jobs are not permanent, as is often the case with construction projects. The State Department found the pipeline would create 35 permanent jobs and 15 temporary jobs once it went into operation. Finally, the Cornell study estimated the project would create about 2,500-4,500 construction jobs, and includes a total economic impact of about 33,000 to 44,000 jobs likely spread across multiple years. Meaning, it’s possible that 11,000 to 14,600 are employed each year if the project takes three years. We told Boehner’s office that TransCanada was no longer promoting the Perryman Group study. They then directed us to a 2011 study by the Canadian Energy Research Institute, a group that includes energy company executives, as well as government and academic representation, on its board of directors. The institute found that employment would go up in the United States by 80,000 jobs to a peak of 179,000 jobs. But those projections were over a 30-year period, and it includes jobs created by existing Canadian energy projects. Our ruling Boehner said Obama’s ""delay in approving Keystone is costing Americans more than 100,000 jobs."" He was citing a study that experts said was ""flawed"" and the company in charge of the project, TransCanada, said was ""no longer relevant."" The State Department estimated a much lower amount, and TransCanada cited that study to PolitiFact. We rate Boehner’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097023F80>],/factchecks/2014/jun/26/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-keystone-xl-pipeline-would-creat/

Scott ad blames Crist for '3,000 teachers laid off'
","Former Gov. Charlie Crist often tells voters that he saved thousands of teachers’ jobs when he accepted federal stimulus dollars during the recession. But Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s political committee, Let’s Get to Work, slams Crist for the loss of thousands of teacher jobs in a TV ad. Here is part of the script: ""Governor Crist cut education by $300 million. Under Governor Crist, 3,000 teachers laid off,"" says the narrator, as text on the screen cites the Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""Governor Crist allowed college tuition to go up 15 percent every year. Our schools and students paid the price."" Here, we will fact-check if 3,000 teachers were laid off under Crist and if he was to blame. The ad launched in the Orlando, Tampa and West Palm markets starting June 24. (We’ve already fact-checked claims about the 15 percent college tuition differential.) Spoiler alert: State data shows the number of teachers statewide dropped between the 2007-08 and 2008-09 school years by a number slightly larger than what the ad reports. But determining how many were laid off is tricky, and if the Republicans want to blame Crist, then they should also blame the Republican-dominated Legislature that signed off on the cuts amid a recession. How Florida cut education during the recession In the years leading up to Charlie Crist winning the governor’s race in 2006, the Florida economy was booming, pushing up funding for education. The K-12 budget when Crist took office was nearly $18 billion, including state and local dollars. But in 2007, Florida’s tax collections sagged as the economy crumbled. The Legislature held a special session in September to determine how to fill a $1.1 billion hole in a $71 billion state budget. Education and health care, two of the largest expenses ended up taking huge hits. Crist promised if voters approved a property tax cut in January 2008, it wouldn’t diminish school funding. He proposed a budget plan that called for a $1 billion increase in funding. But in 2008, the state continued to suffer from a recession that led to more cuts. Republican leaders rejected Crist’s call to expand Lottery games and a property tax hike to pay for schools. ""No Tax Increases,"" declared a sign on the House floor as lawmakers debated the final budget bill in 2008. By the end of the session, lawmakers cut K-12 by more than $300 million. Democrats, the minority party in Tallahassee, and the teachers’ union opposed the cuts. ""We all want to do more,"" said Crist, a Republican at the time, at the end of the session. ""You just do the best you can."" Amid shortfalls, the Legislature continued to slash the budget in 2009. But then the state got some help from the feds. In 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the $787 billion federal stimulus bill that saved jobs for teachers and other government workers nationwide. Crist proudly touts his support for the stimulus -- saying that he stopped ""the layoffs of some 20,000 school teachers during the global economic meltdown."" Without stimulus dollars, there could have been massive teacher layoffs, though it’s difficult to pinpoint the precise number. State data indicated that about 19,000 full-time equivalent jobs for instructional personnel were saved by the stimulus. Crist was a big-time cheerleader for the stimulus (literally embracing President Barack Obama over it) but the main credit for passing it goes to Obama and Congress. We rated Crist’s claim that he stopped 20,000 teacher layoffs Half True. Republicans cite report for teacher layoff numbers The ad attacking Crist for 3,000 teacher layoffs relies on a September 2009 report by the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research that tallied jobs shed from state and local governments during the recession. The report includes a list that shows the lost teacher jobs in Florida added up to about 3,700. Here’s the problem with the way the ad uses that report: it doesn’t explain that it was based on news articles about layoffs or potential layoffs. The report explains that caveat clearly: ""This list shows press accounts of government planned job cuts. In some cases, the cuts may not have actually been implemented because of subsequent budget adjustments. Also, the job losses may have been met through attrition rather than actual layoffs."" For example, one article cited in the report stated that Miami-Dade, the state’s largest district, ""cut nearly 1,000 teaching positions."" But the Miami Herald reported that many teachers were moved into other jobs, and a district spokesman told PolitiFact Florida that no teacher was laid off. Broward initially cut about 400 teachers, but rehired about 75 percent of them. While Marion County announced it would cut about 500 workers, the stimulus ""saved us from having to lay a single person off in 2008 or 2009,"" a school district spokesman told PolitiFact Florida. Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties -- none of which were cited in the report -- didn’t lay off any teachers. (The report only cited about 15 percent of Florida’s school districts.) State data doesn’t show reasons for teacher declines School districts report to the state Department of Education the number of teachers they have each year. That data showed 3,282 fewer teachers in the fall of 2008 compared to 2007 -- about a 2 percent decline. There was a smaller drop the next year. It’s fair to assume that some of those declines were due to layoffs, but the districts don’t tell the state how many of the declines were due to layoffs or other reasons such as teachers who retired, quit or were fired. ""There were some layoffs during the steep downhill dive of the state economy, but there was a strong effort in school districts to avoid teacher layoffs,"" said Ruth Haseman Melton, director of government relations for the Florida School Boards Association. In some districts that meant other support workers -- such as custodians or bus drivers -- absorbed the bulk of the layoffs, she said. Our ruling A TV ad by Scott’s political committee says that under Crist, 3,000 teachers were laid off. The ad omits some key points. The number was derived from media reports about possible layoffs, not all were actual layoffs. Also, Crist accepted federal stimulus money that preserved thousands of teacher jobs. Finally, Crist was not solely responsible for teacher layoffs. Crist and the Republican-led Legislature signed off on budget cuts amid a national recession -- and no single politician is responsible for that economic meltdown. Clearly, some teachers were laid off statewide, but the ad lacks evidence that it amounted to 3,000 positions. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097556140>],/factchecks/2014/jun/26/rick-scott/scott-ad-blames-crist-3000-teachers-laid/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker says Mary Burke tied to billions in tax hikes
","Gov. Scott Walker’s latest TV ad seeks to link his leading rival for governor to ""billions"" in tax increases approved under Walker’s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. The new TV spot, which uses a gambling motif complete with playing cards that depict Doyle as a joker and Burke as a queen, says: ""When Jim Doyle was governor and Mary Burke was commerce secretary, they gambled taxpayer money on dreadful policies, like billions in middle-class tax hikes on nursing home beds, gas, phones and garbage."" The ad then blames the duo for ""state budgets that created billions in deficits, and unemployment rates above the national average for the only time in 25 years."" ""Wisconsin can’t afford to be dealt another bad hand by Mary Burke,"" it concludes. The unemployment rate claim is a familiar one. We gave the state Republican Party a Mostly True when it said ""The only time over the last 25 years when the state’s unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. average was when Burke was commerce secretary."" But what about the tax-hike claim in the ad? When we asked Walker campaign spokeswoman Alleigh Marré for back up, she pointed in part to fiscal estimates for specific tax and fee increases in the proposed 2007-’09 state budget, as calculated by the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The bureau is considered the gold standard for budget scorekeeping. The estimates show that when Burke was commerce secretary (Feb. 2005 - Nov. 2007), Doyle’s proposed 2007-’09 budget sought a higher tax on nursing home beds and proposed a new tax on oil company revenues based on vehicle fuel sales. What about taxes on ""garbage"" and ""phones""? They are not listed as tax increases, but the same Fiscal Bureau report tallies fee increases. Doyle sought increases in ""tipping fees"" for disposing of recyclables and industrial waste. And he sought fees on telecommunications companies to help fund various library services. The gas and nursing home taxes came to $305 million in Doyle’s two-year budget proposal. The fees would have added another $61 million. Grand total: $366 million. That’s far short of the ""billions"" mentioned in the TV ad. The gap grows when you look at the final version of that 2007 budget as signed by Doyle. The Legislature, which was under split control of Democrats and Republicans, changed the budget and the final budget included $19 million in increases for the items mentioned in the TV ad. In the list she sent us, Marré added a big item not mentioned in the TV ad: a $414 million tax increase on hospital’s revenue, to support state health programs. It didn’t make it into the adopted budget, but even if you count that proposal, the tally is $780 million, not ""billions."" When asked about the ad’s ""billions"" claim, Marré contended other Doyle budgets -- not just 2007-09 -- are fair game. The TV ad, she said, is meant to refer to tax increases at any point in Doyle’s time (2003-2011) -- or increases during Burke’s state time. But the ad isn’t clear on that. The ad’s language -- ""When Jim Doyle was governor and Mary Burke was commerce secretary"" -- refers to their time together. And Burke was around for development of just one budget. Later budget Nevertheless, we took a look at the 2009-11 budget, which Marré argued should be included when evaluating the ad. By our calculation, that second budget proposal contained $520 million to $1.35 billion in new taxes and fees on the four items cited in the ad. (It depends on whether you count $830 million in fees on telecommunications companies as a levy on ""phones""; the bill barred companies from passing it directly along on consumers’ bills). So if you add the two budgets together, there were as much as $1.7 billion in new taxes on those four items. But there’s a major problem with tying Burke to that budget. She left more than a year before it was proposed. Marré brought up one last point, a quote from Burke that is also in the TV ad, which says, ""Mary Burke came out saying, ‘I support Gov. Doyle’s positions entirely.’"" Burke did say that, in an interview with the Wisconsin State Journal: Q: Are you politically active? Burke:  No, and I can't say why or why not...I've always been an independent. I've always voted for who I thought was the best person for the position. I support Gov. Doyle's positions entirely. I'm very impressed, and I'm starting to feel very Democratic at this point because I feel he is just doing so much that's right for Wisconsin that creates a better place to live for everyone."" The comment is sweeping, so it’s fair game. But it’s from April 2005. That gives it limited value at best as evidence of how Burke felt about a Doyle budget proposed after she left state government. Our rating In a campaign ad, Walker says that ""when Jim Doyle was governor and Mary Burke was commerce secretary,"" Wisconsin saw ""billions in middle-class tax hikes on nursing home beds, gas, phones and garbage."" As a cabinet secretary, Burke would have had some impact on one of Doyle’s budgets. And it did contain increases on those four items. But the ad misfires badly on the math and the blame game. Proposed new taxes and fees in that one budget totalled $366 million on nursing homes, gas, garbage and phones, not ""billions."" And the tally was far less in the final version of the budget Doyle signed. Beyond that, Burke was gone when Doyle’s subsequent budget sought up to $1.35 billion more for those items in 2009. We rate Walker’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A424640>],/factchecks/2014/jun/26/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-mary-burke-tied-billions-tax-hik/

Cost of prepaid college tuition nosedived under Scott, says Republican Party
","Students, teachers and a mom praise Gov. Rick Scott’s record on higher education and bash that of Democratic front-runner Charlie Crist in a new TV ad released June 17, 2014, from the Republican Party of Florida. ""You know college has become so expensive. Gov. Crist was a governor that was not looking out for Florida. Tuition skyrocketed. You know Charlie Crist made college cost more. Charlie Crist did not make education a priority,"" states the ad, as a 2009 Tampa Bay Times headline flashes on the screen citing a tuition increase of up to 15 percent. ""Rick Scott has put a lot of money back into education,"" the ad continues. ""Gov. Rick Scott cut the cost of prepaid college tuition by nearly $20,000. A lot of my students now see hope. Rick Scott has made college more affordable."" We previously fact-checked a claim by Scott that Crist ""allowed college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year"" and rated that Mostly True. (And we have fact-checked other claims in the race about higher education cuts.) Here we will fact-check the Republicans’ claim that Scott cut the cost of prepaid college tuition by nearly $20,000. Florida prepaid college tuition program The Florida Legislature created the Stanley G. Tate Prepaid College Program in 1987. Here’s how it works: Families set up an advanced payment contract, typically paying a monthly fee. That allows families to lock in many of the costs associated with college and apply it when their child heads off to college. For example, someone who purchased a contract earlier this year for a newborn would lock in to pay $350 a month, which would generate enough money to cover college when their child enrolls in 2032. (Parents can also sign up children in later years, too, though that increases the monthly cost.) While the plans are designed to cover tuition at Florida schools and universities, the money can be applied to schools in other states. We should note that setting aside the money isn’t a guarantee that a child will get into college; they still have to apply and be accepted. About 80 percent of families choose the monthly option which includes interest so it adds up to paying more over 18 years than those who pay the lump sum up front. (It operates much like a mortgage -- homeowners pay less over the term of a mortgage if they pay it more quickly.) More than 1.6 million prepaid plans have been purchased and nearly 350,000 students have attended college using these plans. The program is popular, but the amount for new plans skyrocketed in 2008 and again in 2010 -- for example the lump sum payment rose from about $22,000 in 2009 to $40,000 in 2010. The hikes were as a result of the Legislature approving the ""tuition differential"" that allowed universities to tack on an extra increase in tuition up to 15 percent. (First the hike was reserved for University of Florida and Florida State University, but later additional universities were added.) The prepaid college board assumed that universities would use that maximum amount, sending the costs into an upward spiral. This year, the Legislature passed House Bill 851, which will cause the prepaid program to drop in cost starting with the enrollment period that begins Oct. 15. The bill lowers tuition costs because it: • eliminates automatic annual rate-of-inflation increase for all universities; • gets rid of tuition differential for all but two universities (UF and FSU); • for UF and FSU, the tuition differential drops from an annual maximum of 15 percent to 6 percent. The bill passed the House 84-32 and the Senate 26-13 and Scott signed it June 9. (The bill also established in-state tuition for certain illegal immigrants who arrived here as children.) For the prepaid plans, the price of the four-year university plan would be reduced by ""at least $10,000"" for future participants, according to a House staff analysis of the bill. Additionally, thousands of families already participating in prepaid plans will get refunds or reductions, depending on the plan. The Florida Prepaid College Board cites an even bigger savings on its website: the lump sum price of the Four-Year Florida University Plan for newborns is anticipated to drop nearly $20,000 from its current price of $54,000 to $35,000 or less. For those who choose the monthly payments for the same plan, the board anticipates the monthly payments will drop at least $100, from $350 to $250 or less. Over the life of a plan, that could add up to about $22,000 less than before the Legislature passed this bill, a spokeswoman for the prepaid board told PolitiFact Florida. More precise figures under both scenarios will emerge in September when the board sets costs for the new enrollment period. We asked Ryan Duffy, a spokesman for Florida House speaker Will Weatherford, why the House staff analysis cited a savings of ""at least $10,000"" while the prepaid board said savings would add up to ""nearly $20,000."" The $10,000 figure was a conservative estimate provided by the prepaid college board in February based on an earlier version of the bill, Duffy said. That lower figure did not include the changes to tuition differential. Our ruling A TV ad by the Republican Party of Florida stated ""Gov. Rick Scott cut the cost of prepaid college tuition by nearly $20,000."" That figure comes from a projection by the prepaid college tuition board which anticipates that a newborn’s lump-sum plan will decline by that amount.   An earlier analysis of the bill placed a more conservative estimate of ""at least $10,000"" but that did not fully reflect the changes approved by the Legislature to lower the costs. The main caveat here is that Scott doesn’t get full credit: the Legislature signed off on the bill, too. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DEE200>],/factchecks/2014/jun/25/republican-party-florida/cost-prepaid-college-tuition-nosedived-under-scott/

Fox's Doocy: NASA fudged data to make the case for global warming
","On climate change, Gallup pollsters say Americans divide into three groups -- the ""Concerned Believers,"" the ""Mixed Middle,"" and the ""Cool Skeptics."" Believers have a slender plurality at 39 percent but skeptics make up a solid 25 percent. They think there’s little to worry about and that media reports on the topic are exaggerated. Fox News host Steve Doocy gave the doubters some ammunition on June 24, 2014. In a segment on Fox and Friends called ""News by the Numbers,"" Doocy drew viewers’ attention to the year 1934. ""That's the hottest year on record in the United States,"" Doocy said. ""At least until NASA scientists fudged the numbers to make 1998 the hottest year to overstate the extent of global warming. The 1930s were by far the hottest decade in the United States."" A reader wondered if NASA really did cook the books (we love reader suggestions!), so we are checking Doocy’s claim about fudging the numbers. We asked Fox News for their source and while they didn’t respond, a number of conservative news outlets have made much in recent days of a blog post from a man who writes under the pseudonym Steven Goddard. Goddard charged that until 2000, NASA reported that in the United States, 1934 was hotter than 1998 and that the country has been cooling since then. ""Right after the year 2000, NASA and NOAA dramatically altered U.S. climate history, making the past much colder and the present much warmer,"" Goddard wrote. He provided this animated chart to prove his point (the chart marked ""a"" is the old version):  Climate science experts say not so fast Doocy exaggerated the findings in this blog post when he applied it to global warming. The post itself only talks about U.S. land temperatures and what happens in the United States is separate from global shifts. As far as what the blog actually claimed, while it accurately copied the changes in the government charts, experts in U.S. temperature measurement say it ignores why the charts shifted. There were major changes in how the country gathered temperature information over the decades. Zeke Hausfather is a data scientist with Berkeley Earth, a research group that has expressed doubts about some of the reports on climate change coming from Washington and international bodies. Hausfather took Goddard to task when Goddard made a similar claim about numbers fudging earlier this month. The missing piece in Goddard’s analysis, Hausfather said, was he ignored that the network of weather stations that feed data to the government today is not the one that existed 80 years ago. ""He is simply averaging absolute temperatures,"" Hausfather wrote. ""Absolute temperatures work fine if and only if the composition of the station network remains unchanged over time."" Weather stations that once were in a valley might now be on a hill top and vice versa. But the shift could be greater than simple elevation. Stations were moved from one part of a state to another. The number of stations within a given area shifted. All these differences, Hausfather and other experts said, will alter the typical temperatures gathered by government meteorologists. Gavin Schmidt, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said the raw data used in the blog post suffered from an equally troubling flaw. The temperatures were not measured at the same time of day. ""Over time, the U.S. network went from recording max/min temperatures at different points of the day, to doing it at midnight,"" Schmidt said. In fact, volunteers staffed many of the stations. Before 1940, most followed Weather Service guidelines and recorded the temperature at sundown. Through the second half of the century, there was a gradual shift to recording morning temperatures. This change produced the appearance of a cooling trend when none existed. Comparing apples to apples Better instruments and more consistent methods have allowed scientists to collect more reliable data. But for climate studies, long-term trends are key and the challenge has been how to make the best use of the older readings. In the mid 1980s, the government settled on a list of about 1,200 stations across the country to track temperature trends. Around 1990, climatologists began delivering computer programs to factor in the artificial changes that systematically pushed the readings one way or the other. Over time, they accounted for the impacts of equipment, location, the time of day of measurements and urbanization (more asphalt leads to higher surface temperatures). There is no question that running the raw data through these programs changes the graphs of average temperatures. However, multiple researchers from a variety of institutions have fed into this process and come up with their own computer models. Results from different teams largely match up. John Nielsen-Gammon is a researcher at Texas A&M University and is the Texas state climatologist. Nielsen-Gammon finds nothing nefarious in the government analysis of temperature trends. ""It is reasonable to expect the adjusted data record to change over time as the technology for identifying and removing artificial changes improves,"" Nielsen-Gammon said. ""If there are any biases, they are caused by the quality of the underlying data, not by any biases intentionally introduced into the adjustment process."" All of the experts we reached or whose work we read rejected Goddard’s conclusions. Mark  C. Serreze, professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder, said no fabrication has taken place. ""Goddard's results stem from an erroneous analysis of the data,"" Serreze said. Anthony Watts, a popular skeptic of most climate change data, posted his objection to Goddard’s claim. ""I took Goddard to task over this as well in a private email, saying he was very wrong and needed to do better,"" Watts wrote. Our ruling Doocy with Fox News said NASA scientists fudged the numbers to overstate the extent of global warming. This exaggerated the thrust in the underlying blog post. It accused government scientists of altering the U.S. temperature record, not the record for the entire earth. As for what the blog said, we found that experts across the spectrum found fundamental flaws in its analytic methods. By relying on raw data, it ignored that the number and location of weather stations and the methods of measuring temperatures across the United States have changed greatly over the past 80 years. The experts we reached or whose work we read generally agree that the corrections for flawed data produce valid results. The bare bones approach used in the blog post provides no solution to the issues of weaknesses in the raw data.

Jim Rubens claims fellow Republican Scott Brown 'voted with Obama 70 percent of the time'
","When New Hampshire Republican Jim Rubens came face-to-face with Scott Brown in the race for a U.S. Senate seat, Rubens didn’t waste any time going on the attack. ""In 2011, you voted with president Obama 70 percent of the time,"" Rubens said to Brown, his GOP primary opponent, in his opening remarks during a June 20, 2014, forum televised on WMUR-TV. It was a line that underscored criticism from Brown’s opponents about the strength of Brown’s conservative beliefs. Brown has touted his bipartisan credentials in the past, and while representing Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate from 2010-2012, Brown developed a track record as one of the lawmakers most willing to reach across the aisle. But did Brown really support Democratic President Barack Obama’s agenda 70 percent of the time, as Rubens stated? This isn’t the first time a candidate’s record of support for Obama has been invoked in the U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire. For instance, Brown has claimed several times that the Democrat who currently holds the seat, U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, voted with Obama 99 percent of the time. PolitiFact New Hampshire previously ruled that claim Mostly True, based on research conducted by the publication Congressional Quarterly. In its annual Vote Studies, CQ examines voting patterns for every member of Congress and sorts them in ways that allow comparisons. One of those ways is an examination of presidential support, or the number of votes by each lawmaker on bills on which the sitting president has staked a position. The 2011 CQ analysis found that, out of the pool of votes on which Obama took a clear position that year, Brown’s vote matched the president’s stance 69.6 percent of the time. That score is in line with the claim Rubens made. Out of all Republicans in the Senate, only Maine Sen. Susan Collins recorded a higher presidential support score that year, based on CQ’s analysis. Brown’s presidential support score was somewhat lower during his first year in office. In 2010, CQ determined, Brown supported Obama’s positions about 60.7 percent of the time. The number rose to about 78 percent during Brown’s final year in office in 2012. It’s important to note that there are limitations to gauging any politician’s support for the president based solely on the small number of votes represented in the CQ analysis. In 2011, for example, the Senate took 235 roll call votes. CQ registers Obama as having taken a clear stance on only 89 of those votes, most of which were taken on presidential nominations. After he was criticized by Rubens, Brown pointed out that he was proud to join Obama in supporting pieces of legislation such as the VOW to Hire Heroes Act, which provides tax incentives for businesses that hire unemployed veterans. Brown’s campaign also pointed out that Brown’s presidential support score in the 2011 CQ analysis placed him midway between the average Republican and average Democrat in the Senate. According to CQ’s figures, the average Senate Republican voted with the president 53 percent of the time, while the average Democrat supported the president 92 percent of the time. Our ruling Rubens said that when Brown was serving in the U.S. Senate in 2011, Brown voted with President Obama 70 percent of the time. In 2011, Brown took the same position as the president 69.6 percent of the time when Obama outlined a clear position, based on analysis by Congressional Quarterly. Rounding off, Rubens was right on the money. But it’s important to note the president doesn’t take a clear position on all legislation and outlined his position on only 38 percent of the roll call votes taken in 2011. Overall, the number is accurate, but needs additional clarification. We rate this claim Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097739E40>],/factchecks/2014/jun/25/jim-rubens/jim-rubens-claims-fellow-republican-scott-brown-vo/

","A chain email that’s been circulating for years -- listing what it claims are President Barack Obama’s ""accomplishments,"" except they’re all negative -- has recently gone into heavy rotation again, judging by reader requests to fact-check it. By now, we’ve fact-checked three of the dozens of ""accomplishments"" listed in the email, and each has earned a rating of Pants on Fire. The claim we will check here is that Obama is the ""first president to appoint 45 czars to replace elected officials in his office."" We took a look at Obama’s czars back in 2009, when Sen. John McCain asserted that Obama had more czars than the Romanovs. We concluded that Romanovs had 18 and Obama had 28, so we rated it True. That said, no one should conclude that the chain email’s claim is correct. So what is a czar, anyway? The term ""czar"" is unofficial -- something that is more often used by the media than by the government itself. As best as we can tell, it’s a title that the media likes to use to shorthand someone’s real position. Officially, a government employee may be ""chairman of the Recovery Act accountability transparency board,"" but it’s much easier for journalists to refer to the ""Stimulus Czar."" Ditto for the ""acting Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Stability and Chief Troubled Asset Relief Program Counsel,"" often called ""TARP Czar."" How many czars does Obama have? The claim that Obama has 45 czars appears to come from a 2011 report by Judicial Watch, a conservative advocacy group. The group counted 45 czars appointed by Obama and 18 other unfilled or planned czar positions. By our count, that number is inflated. For example, Valerie Jarrett is listed as the ""Special Advisor Czar."" The president has numerous special advisers like Jarrett. This suggests one could theoretically label every special advisor to the president a ""czar."" A few others, such as the ""Safe Schools Czar"" and ""War Czar,"" are positions started under President George W. Bush. The ""Oil Czar"" is listed as Ray Mabus, who is Senate-confirmed Secretary of the Navy. We contacted Judicial Watch to get a response to these more questionable positions. Czars are identified and become a problem when there is a lack of transparency and when they oversee statutory government positions, said Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch. This raises questions of constitutionality, he said. Fitton acknowledged that czars have been a longstanding, bipartisan practice. The czars created under the Bush administration were included in the list because Obama also appointed officers to these positions, he said. From what we can tell, the term is subjective enough that the Judicial Watch number is a rough estimate, too -- including any appointed position they see as potentially damaging to the system of checks and balances. Czars don’t replace elected officials, they’re appointed The biggest flat-out inaccuracy of the email’s claim is not the number of czars, but that any of these czars replaced elected officials. There are only two people in the executive branch who are elected -- the president and the vice president. To the extent that anyone is a czar at all, they are not replacing an elected official. They would either be filling a new job that didn’t exist before, or occupying an existing appointed position. We should also note that Obama is hardly the first president to appoint czars. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution (Article II, Section 2) states that officers of the United States must be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate. A position is an office if it is ""invested by legal authority with a portion of the sovereign powers of the federal Government"" and ""continuing"" in nature. Commissioned military officers and cabinet secretaries fall under this definition. But Congress may also allow the president alone to appoint ""inferior officers"" -- advisers and directors often working in the White House who are not vetted or confirmed by the Senate. ""Czars"" often fall into this category. Since at least President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s terms, each president has created new positions for various policy issues. A video released by the Democratic National Committee in 2009 cheekily titled, ""Dancing with the Czars,"" claimed George W. Bush appointed 47 czars. We asked some experts what they thought of the list of Obama-appointed czars. Paul C. Light, New York University professor of public service, said ""Obama has set the record"" for appointing czars and has ""defined czar down to the point that the term no longer has any punch."" John Palguta, vice president for policy at Partnership for Public Service, agreed that ""simply attaching the term ‘czar’ to someone in a position of responsibility doesn’t mean anything."" However, his opinion on czars differed. ""There are about 2.1 million civilian positions in the government, not counting the Postal Service or the military ... and the president needs people in leadership positions to help manage this very large and complex enterprise,"" said Palguta. ""Frankly, 45 appointments seems to be a relatively small number, especially since at least some of those appointments are to positions that the president is expected to fill."" Our ruling A chain email said Obama is the ""first president to appoint 45 czars to replace elected officials in his office."" Perhaps two dozen Obama administration officials have been genuinely referred to as czars -- a smaller number than the email claims -- but it’s important to note that ""czar"" is more a term of the media than it is of the government. Most important, though, is that not a single one of these czars replaced an elected official. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F2B5C0>],/factchecks/2014/jun/25/chain-email/obama-appointed-45-czars-replace-elected-officials/

Benefits of minimum wage increase debated
","In his 2013 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama called on Congress to raise the national minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $9 an hour. By executive order, he has since set $10.10 an hour as the standard for individuals working on new federal service contracts. The issue took off in legislatures across the country this year, with some familiar arguments. Supporters say a higher base wage will stimulate the economy. Critics says jobs will be lost when employers can’t offset their higher costs with higher prices. Thirty-eight state legislatures considered minimum-wage bills this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In Georgia, Senate Bill 314 called for raising Georgia’s minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, but it didn’t get so much as a hearing. Last week, the Georgia Restaurant Association released study results forecasting a potential loss of 21,000 jobs, 12,700 held by women, if the federal minimum wage goes to $10.10 an hour. The study, conducted by Trinity University labor economist David Macpherson, also found that about 60,562 state and local government employees in Georgia would be in line for raises, with a $10.10 hourly minimum wage. The cost to taxpayers would be more than $164 million annually, benefits included. PolitiFact scribes decided to look deeper into the study’s findings on the impact to the wallets of government workers -- and taxpayers. A bit of background. Georgia’s minimum wage is technically $5.15 an hour (Georgia Code 34-4-3) and has been that since 2001. But the vast majority of Georgia employers (some say more than 99 percent) must comply with the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, which means they have to pay their employees the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Although the president initially wanted Congress to increase the hourly minimum wage to $9, he has since aligned with leading Senate Democrats who are pushing for a $10.10 hourly minimum and getting pushback from the GOP-controlled House. (A 40-hour-a-week employee making $10.10 an hour grosses about $21,000 a year.) The independent Congressional Budget Office analyzed two options: 1). raising the minimum wage to $10.10 in three steps -- in 2014, 2015 and 2016. After reaching $10.10 in 2016, the minimum wage would be adjusted annually for inflation as measured by the consumer price index. 2). a $9 hourly minimum wage done in two steps -- in 2015 and 2016. After the minimum reaches $9 in 2016, there would not be any subsequent increases for inflation. Among the CBO’s major findings was that a minimum wage increase to $10.10 an hour could lift 900,000 workers out of poverty. (By the second half of 2016, about 16.5 million people would be earning higher average weekly wages if the $10.10 minimum wage were implemented, CBO estimates show.) But it also could cost 500,000 jobs. The White House and congressional Democrats -- who have been trying to make a federal minimum-wage increase a top issue in this year’s elections -- took issue with the CBO report (which relied on 60 different empirical studies to formulate its estimates.) Others, including Macpherson, consider it spot on. We reached out to Macpherson, the author of the Georgia Restaurant Association’s study, to find out how he came up with his conclusions. He said he used data from the U.S. Census Bureau on government employees and followed the CBO’s methodology. Specifically, he looked at the wages paid to state and local government workers in Georgia in 2011, 2012 and 2013. He found that 60,562 -- or 10.4 percent of about 550,000 state and local government workers in Georgia -- were making below $10.10 an hour and would likely still be making under $10.10 an hour by 2015. His calculations of the costs to governments -- and hence taxpayers -- of raising the workers’ pay to $10.10 an hour took into account other expenses, including higher Social Security, Medicare, workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance, he said. (In salaries alone, it would cost $150.8 million annually, the study found.) Most of the government workers would likely keep their jobs, unlike in the private sector, where businesses have ""the profit incentive,"" Macpherson said. Governments, he said, have alternatives, including raising taxes. ""Raising wages is an admirable goal, but the evidence suggests that accomplishing this goal with a blunt wage mandate could do more harm than good,"" the study says. It also notes, however, that ""to the extent that state or local governments reduce hours or employment in response to the minimum wage hike, (the study’s) estimate of the cost of the hike would be overstated."" We know the study’s cost are off at least slightly. That’s because Macpherson’s study counted all local and state government workers in Georgia, including city of Atlanta employees who, as of this year, are making at least within 10 cents of the proposed $10.10 minimum wage. The Atlanta City Council last year agreed with Mayor Kasim Reed’s 2014 budget recommendation that, among other things, raised all employees’ salaries to a minimum of $10 per hour. Macpherson said he didn’t think Atlanta’s numbers would change his overall cost projections by much. But he said that would depend on how many Atlanta city workers were affected by the wage change, a detail PolitiFact could not immediately determine. State Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta, a co-sponsor of this year’s minimum-wage legislation, said the move by Atlanta officials may help make the case that raising the minimum wage isn’t a major financial burden. ""I don’t have any reason to believe it created a hardship of any sort for the city,"" Fort said. David Cooper, an economic analyst with the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, said raising the minimum wage to $10.10 might have a spillover effect on the salaries of about 90,000 state and local government workers, given that adjustments might have to be made to the salaries of their supervisors, as well. Cooper also questioned whether Macpherson’s cost projections might be too high. About 900,000 Georgians of all walks would receive salary increases if the minimum wage were increased to $10.10, for a collective $1.3 billion in new wages, he said. That would generate about $136.5 million in new tax revenue and could be enough to reduce some government benefits these workers currently can receive, Cooper said. ""It’s probably budget neutral, if not budget positive,"" he said. Wesley Tharpe, a tax and economic policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said the economic research is clear. ""Minimum-wage increases have a negligible effect on employment but are a proven means to boost family incomes and lift people out of poverty,"" Tharpe said. In summary, the researchers took the same basic approach as the CBO to try to gauge the potential impact of moving to a $10.10 minimum wage for state and local government workers. But it’s hard to say for sure what the cost to taxpayers might be. To do that, you would have to consider, among other things, the potential savings when some of these workers no longer receive food stamps, heating assistance or other taxpayer-funded poverty programs. We also know the projections are at least somewhat off because Atlanta workers already work for $10 an hour at minimum. And no one can forecast how local governments would respond -- they could cut jobs to fund a wage increase. There is some truth to the statement. But a lot of context is missing. That’s PolitiFact’s definition of Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097459740>],/factchecks/2014/jun/25/georgia-restaurant-association-georgia/benefits-minimum-wage-increase-debated/

Barack Obama says U.S. differs from developed world on paid maternity leave
","President Barack Obama convened the first Working Families Summit in Washington this week to unite his administration, labor organizations and progressive groups around his domestic agenda. Ahead of the conference (and a visit to Chipotle), Obama published an op-ed in the Huffington Post on June 23, 2014, to make a push for what he called ""family-friendly workplace policies."" Among the issues he hopes to pursue is a paid maternity leave for mothers. In his piece, Obama claimed, ""The United States is the only developed country in the world without paid maternity leave."" That’s quite the statement. But is it true? The Family Medical Leave Act requires employers with 50 or more workers to allow parents 12 weeks of job-protected leave annually to care for a newborn. While this means those individuals can take the time off without fear of losing their job, in most cases the leave is unpaid. Three states — California, New Jersey and Rhode Island — offer paid family leave through employee-paid payroll taxes. And some employers offer the perk even though it’s not required. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 12 percent of private industry workers had access to some kind of paid family leave. How does that compare to the rest of the world? We asked the White House for the source of Obama’s claim. They pointed us to a report by the International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations. The report looked at 170 countries where maternity benefit information was available. It found that only two don’t provide some kind of cash benefit to women during maternity leave: Papua New Guinea and the United States. That seems pretty convincing in its own right, but as the report notes, not all benefits are equal. Some countries cap the payments at low levels or exclude large portions of the population from eligibility. Obama specified in his statement that he was comparing the United States to developed countries, so that’s what we’ll focus on. For its part, the report labeled 41 countries and territories ""developed economies."" It’s pretty clear that the United States provides the fewest benefits to the smallest percentage of its people. Of the developed countries, not only is it the only one that does not offer or require paid maternity leave, it is also mandates the shortest period of time off. The United Kingdom and Australia provide the most time off, with both countries allowing a full year of leave, though not all of it is paid. At 13 weeks of maternity leave (all paid), Iceland has the second shortest leave, behind the U.S. at 12 weeks. The International Labor Organization also categorizes each country by what percentage of the population actually receives cash benefits for maternity leave. Of the developed countries, the United States is in the bracket with the smallest percentages, with an estimated 10 to 32 percent of the population eligible for paid leave. No other developed country is below 33 percent. Of the 41 developed countries, 17 provide paid time off for between 90 and 100 percent of their populations, including many Western European countries like Sweden, Switzerland and the U.K., but also Estonia and Czech Republic. But some countries exclude certain portions of their populations from eligibility, making it far from a universal benefit. Temporary workers do not receive cash benefits in Canada, home workers don’t receive maternity leave in Norway and Switzerland, and some civil servants don’t get any in Japan. Canada also excludes migrant workers and individuals that own more than 40 percent of their business, and it requires women to have at least 600 hours of insurable employment to be eligible. The result is that in some countries, large portions of the population don’t end up actually being covered. In Spain and Japan, between 33 and 65 percent of workers are covered, the fewest other than the United States. The International Labor Organization also sets a standard for what countries should provide in a benefits package: 1) women should receive at least 14 weeks off; 2) they should be reimbursed at least two-thirds of their previous earnings and 3) the benefit should be paid almost entirely by the state through public funds or social security. The United States is the only developed country to meet none of the benchmarks (and one of just 14 studied worldwide). But six other countries fall short of at least one goal. Canada — Provides payments less than two-thirds of woman’s previous earnings (55 percent) Denmark — Doesn’t pay for benefit entirely through public funds (mix of public and employer contribution) Germany — Doesn’t pay for benefit entirely through public funds (mix of public and employer contribution) Iceland — Maternity leave is less than 14 weeks (13 weeks) Malta — Doesn’t pay for benefit entirely through public funds (mix of public and employer contribution) Slovakia — Provides payments less than two-thirds of woman’s previous earnings (65 percent i.e. very, very close) Our ruling Obama said, ""The United States is the only developed country in the world without paid maternity leave."" The United States does not mandate cash benefits for workers on maternity leave at the federal level, and just a small fraction of its citizens live in states that require it or work for companies that provide it. In that regard, the United States is very different than the rest of the developed world, where at least some paid benefits exist in every country. It's worth noting, however, that paid maternity leave is far from a universal benefit in many developed countries. In some, as many as one-third of workers aren't actually covered for cash benefits, and six countries don't meet all of the International Labor Organizations guidelines for providing benefits.  We rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C65340>],/factchecks/2014/jun/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-differs-developed-world-paid-/

Dick Cheney says President Obama claimed terrorism was 'solved' with Osama bin Laden's death
","It feels a little like 2003 lately, with Iraq in crisis and former Vice President Dick Cheney arguing for a muscular intervention to thwart the rise of violent anti-American extremists. Cheney thrust himself into the punditry ring with a Wall Street Journal op-ed that eviscerated President Barack Obama’s foreign policy and spurred follow-up TV interviews. ABC This Week’s Jonathan Karl asked Cheney about Obama on June 22, saying it ""almost seems like you’re accusing the president of treason here, saying he’s intentionally bringing America down a notch."" Obama’s withdrawal of troops from Iraq and Afghanistan will allow more terrorists to gain a foothold in those countries and threaten U.S. interests, Cheney said. (We previously checked his claim that the number of terrorists has doubled, which we rated True.) ""The scope of the problem, in part, is based upon an unwillingness by the president to recognize we have a problem,"" Cheney said. ""They're still living back in the day when they claimed we got (Osama) bin Laden, terrorism problem solved. That wasn’t true then, it’s even less true today."" The question for us in this fact-check: Did Obama declare the terrorism problem solved after special forces killed bin Laden in 2011? The answer: not that we can find. FactCheck.org looked into a similar claim from Cheney’s June 19 interview with Fox News’ Megyn Kelly. When Kelly called him out for being wrong on Iraq ""time and time again,"" Cheney said, ""Barack Obama has stated repeatedly the terrorist threat is gone, we got bin Laden."" After reviewing Obama’s speeches in recent years, FactCheck found no traces of Obama saying the terrorist threat was ""gone,"" which obviously means he did not say it ""repeatedly."" Our review turned up similar findings. We did not find any instances in which Obama said threats of terrorism are solved, or gone, or just kaput. Spokespeople for the White House and Cheney could not be reached for comment. Obama did not make that claim the night he announced bin Laden’s death, and he has not dismissed the lingering threat from al-Qaida-affiliated groups and other violent jihadists in public comments since 2011. His usual message is bin Laden’s death is a big deal, but the terrorism fight is not over. ""The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation’s effort to defeat al-Qaida,"" Obama said May 1, 2011. ""Yet his death does not mark the end of our effort.  There’s no doubt that al-Qaida will continue to pursue attacks against us. We must –- and we will — remain vigilant at home and abroad."" In the column Cheney co-wrote with daughter Liz, he pinpointed Obama saying ""core al-Qaida is on its heels, has been decimated"" to illustrate the president’s skewed point of view.   The statement, pulled from Obama’s remarks in an Aug. 9, 2013, White House press conference, is accurate but out of context. Obama was responding then to a question from Karl (that guy is everywhere), who asked if Obama still believed ""al-Qaida has been decimated"" after a previous speech, given terrorist threats across the Middle East and Africa that closed diplomatic outposts. Obama’s response: ""What I said in the same National Defense University speech back in May that I referred to earlier is that core al-Qaida is on its heels, has been decimated. But what I also said was that al-Qaida and other extremists have metastasized into regional groups that can pose significant dangers."" That May 2013 university speech also does not contain a proclamation that the country’s terrorism problem is solved. Obama heralded the deaths of bin Laden and his lieutenants but followed up immediately with a warning: ""Now, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists."" During his 2012 re-election campaign, Obama did not consistently follow up on his point that bin Laden is dead with a reminder that the anti-terror fight remains. But even in those cases he usually said al-Qaida was ""on the run"" or ""on the path to defeat."" Reporters noticed when he dropped a reference to al-Qaida being ""on the run"" in a few of his stump speeches, questioning whether he did it because of the deadly attack on the Benghazi special mission on Sept. 11, 2012. (He later restored the reference about al-Qaida being ""on the path to defeat."") Still, Obama never said the problem was solved. Obama has been using the word ""solve"" a bit lately, but not in the way Cheney claims. In explaining why he will not deploy American troops to confront ISIS, Obama said June 19, ""We do not have the ability to simply solve this problem by sending in tens of thousands of troops and committing the kinds of blood and treasure that has already been expended in Iraq. Ultimately, this is something that is going to have to be solved by the Iraqis."" We’ll end on an interesting note highlighted by FactCheck. Cheney’s former boss, President George W. Bush, used similar language as Obama to describe his administration’s efforts to beat back al-Qaida, using ""on the run"" in 2001 and 2003 as well as ""decimated."" Our ruling So did Obama, as Cheney claimed, say ""we got bin Laden, terrorism problem solved""? No. Obama’s foreign policy speeches since bin Laden’s death have qualified the killing as a major achievement in the battle against terrorism, but not the solution to a complex threat. Obama usually notes the problem remains despite the fact that core al-Qaida has decentralized into regional, still dangerous groups. Cheney is either missing or ignoring Obama’s nuanced statements. We rate Cheney’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DF5900>],/factchecks/2014/jun/24/dick-cheney/dick-cheney-says-president-obama-claimed-terrorism/

Facebook meme: Iraq War dollars could have ended world hunger for 30 years
","As sectarian fighting in Iraq spreads, there’s a Facebook meme that captures the public’s frustration with the relative costs and benefits of America’s military intervention in that country. The image makes a simple claim. ""For the cost of the Iraq War we could’ve ended world hunger for 30 years,"" it says. Lee Camp, a stand-up comedian and host of the RT show Redacted Tonight, posted it on his Facebook page. Camp said he didn’t come up with the message, but it made sense to him. ""I looked up (the) numbers and found that the Iraq War has cost us $2 trillion since 2003,"" Camp said. ""The UN estimates ending world hunger each year would cost $30 billion. So ending world hunger since 2003 would have cost $330 billion."" There are a few problems with the numbers, however. First, pinpointing the cost of the war in Iraq isn’t so black-and-white. The $2 trillion figure, for instance, includes future health care and disability costs for veterans. Second, many experts find the claim that $30 billion a year can end world hunger dubious, including one of the world’s leading hunger advocacy groups. Make no mistake, the money would help. But would it end world hunger? We’ll dig into the numbers. Cost of the Iraq War The big debate in tallying the cost of the Iraq War centers on whether the total should include the projected expense of caring for veterans. Adding future health costs boosts the total by anywhere from well over $300 billion to $1 trillion. The direct military, and security, costs are easier to identify. Here are the numbers we found: Congressional Budget Office: $774 billion for direct military spending through 2014. Congressional Research Service: $806 billion, direct military spending and including Veterans Administration spending to date, through 2011. Brown University - Cost of War Project: $770 billion for direct military spending; $40 billion current health costs; $490 billion future health care costs. The total of all costs, including interest on debt and homeland security and more, is $2.2 trillion. Joseph E. Stiglitz and Linda J. Bilmes, co-authors of  co-authors of The Three Trillion Dollar War: The True Cost of the Iraq Conflict: At least $3 trillion, including all current and future costs. New York Times: $872 billion for direct military spending and $26 for billion current health care costs through September 2011; $340 billion for future health care costs. The total for these categories is $1.2 trillion. Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments: $900 billion for direct military spending and current health care costs. ""The future cost of veterans’ benefits and services due to Iraq veterans could well exceed the direct cost of the war itself -- a trillion dollars or more,"" said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the center. The tallies show a wide range. The lowest, $774 billion, comes from the CBO but includes no veterans health care costs. The higher estimates, in the neighborhood of $3 trillion, include a long list of costs that span from 2001 to decades in the future. Cost to end world hunger If we took the highest cost estimates for the war, that would provide about $70 billion annually over 30 years. No one questions that those funds could do a lot of good. But beyond that, the data support little more. The estimate that $30 billion could end world hunger for a year comes from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. In 2008, Senegalese diplomat and director-general Jacques Diouf made an appeal to help the millions of people who are hungry across the globe. ""How can we explain to people of good sense and good faith that it was not possible to find $30 billion a year to enable 862 million hungry people to enjoy the most fundamental of human rights: the right to food and thus the right to life?"" Diouf asked. Multiply $30 billion by 30 years and you have $900 billion. That’s less than several but not all of the estimated costs of the Iraq War -- without factoring in inflation. But a host of experts we talked to agreed that the $30 billion a year figure is impossible to verify and likely incorrect. (The UN Food and Agriculture Organization did not respond to our request for more information about where their estimate comes from.) Part of the problem is counting how many people are in a state of hunger. The UN World Food Programme says the figure is 842 million. The UN Millennium Development Goals project puts the number at 1.02 billion. Part of the problem is trying to estimate what it would take to lift everyone out of hunger. ""I don't believe in the UN claim,"" said William Easterly, a development economist and co-director of New York University’s Development Research Institute. ""The numbers on the extent of world hunger are notoriously unreliable. There is only fragmentary data on stunting and wasting in children, the only direct measure of hunger."" Oxfam America, the national chapter of one of the leading global organizations in the fight against hunger and poverty, is also skeptical. ""We at Oxfam do not have a figure for the price tag to end hunger and we are not aware of any credible recent figures,"" said Laura Rusu, an Oxfam spokeswoman. Liz Young researches world hunger at Staffordshire University in England and is the author of the book Food and Development. Young said the claim is ""impossible to substantiate."" ""Such assertions are normally made by activists to make a point, often a very reasonable point, but such assertions stretch the science a little,"" Young said. Harold Alderman is a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, a Washington group focused on practical solutions to hunger and poverty. Like Young, Alderman doubts the claim but supports the general thrust behind it. ""I am not sure that, counting administration and leakage, that that would quite work to completely end hunger for each person in each year,"" Alderman said. ""But I am fairly confident that it would go a long way towards this goal, especially if over time the number of those in need declines."" Alderman added that there are 10 relatively low-cost approaches that have a proven track record in reducing malnutrition in children and he is very confident that the Iraq War could have paid for those with money to spare. One of the analytic hurdles in this claim lies in its choice of words. If the Facebook post had said the Iraq War could have ended hunger 30 times over, it would have been on slightly firmer ground. As it is, it makes a claim based on the state of global hunger over the next 30 years. Our experts noted that a lot could happen in 30 years to change the dynamics -- from regional armed conflicts, to the effects on food production from climate change. Our ruling The Facebook post said the money spent on the Iraq War would have ended world hunger for 30 years. While a back-of-envelope calculation gives the claim a superficial appearance of accuracy, below the surface it lacks substance. We found no advocacy group or expert who expressed confidence in the estimates of the total number of people who suffer from hunger or in any estimate of what it would cost to end it. A majority felt that the dollars spent on war would have helped a good deal, but the funds would still fall short of the goal. The claim uses the appearance of mathematical accuracy to support a bold vision of the future, but that does not make it more sound. We rate the claim Half True. Correction: An earlier version of this fact-check misspelled the name of Oxfam spokeswoman Laura Rusu.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970B7400>],/factchecks/2014/jun/24/facebook-posts/facebook-meme-iraq-war-dollars-could-have-ended-wo/

Biden says he has no stocks, bonds or savings accounts
","Following in Hillary Clinton's footsteps, Vice President Joe Biden made a splash with a statement about his personal finances. At President Barack Obama's Summit for Working Families Monday, Biden made an attempt to seem relatable to the typical American family by talking about his modest finances. ""I don't own a single stock or bond ... I have no savings accounts. But I got a great pension, and I got a good salary,"" he said. Even though Biden was known as one of the poorest members of Congress while he was a senator, the statement raised some eyebrows. Just last week, we rated Clinton's claim that she and former President Bill Clinton were ""dead broke"" when they left the White House as Mostly False. So how do Biden’s finances stack up? At the North American International Auto Show in January, Biden said that when he first ran for office in 1972, he promised he would never own any stocks or bonds. Biden’s office declined to comment on the record about his finances and whether or not he lived up to that promise. But we were able to look at Biden’s 2013 executive branch personnel public financial disclosure report, which was submitted just last month. The report lists about a dozen investments, all of which fall into the $1,001 - $15,000 range. However, they're not strictly his. All 11 are designated by the letter ""S""-- used to indicate that the holding belongs to the filer’s spouse. That means the 11 investments are owned by Jill Biden, his wife of 37 years. But the savings accounts are a different story. According to the disclosure documents, the Bidens have five savings accounts, which fall into a larger range. Some amounted to less than $1,001, while others fell into the $50,001 - $100,000 category. Four of the five accounts belong to the vice president's wife, while the final one has the classification ""J"" -- a joint account that belongs to both of them. This U.S. Senate Federal Credit Union account's holdings fall into the $1,001 - $15,000 range. Even if the investments aren't in the vice president's name, they are part of his household wealth, and he stands to benefit from their success, said George Pennacchi, a finance professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Jeffrey Hoopes, an accounting professor at Ohio State University, compared the situation to a household with two cars -- where each spouse drives a car, but both titles are only in the husband's name. ""For (the wife) to say she did not own a car would be slightly disingenuous, even if legally true,"" Hoopes said. Additionally, pension funds invest in stocks and bonds or other assets, Pennacchi said. ""Thus, it is inescapable that Mr. Biden’s wealth is both directly and indirectly linked to stock and bond investments,"" Pennacchi said. Biden also holds four checking accounts, two of which he shares with his wife. In addition, he holds six life insurance policies with Mass Mutual. The Bidens reported an adjusted gross income of $407,099 last year, including his vice presidential salary of $230,700. Our ruling Biden said, ""I don't own a single stock or bond... I have no savings accounts."" Biden was wrong to say that he doesn't have a savings account because he shares one with his wife. However, he doesn't have ownership over any stocks and bonds -- those all belong to his wife.

 Water sent through Austin to downstream farmers in 2011 was three times what the city lately uses in a year
","Austin-area residents worried about drought might rue an agency’s 2011 decision to let thousands of gallons of water from the Highland Lakes flow past the capital to downstream farmers, the head of the Austin Water Utility said. A May 27, 2014, news story said: ""Massive releases of water to rice farmers downstream that greatly reduced lake levels in 2011, the single driest year in Central Texas history, didn’t help either."" The story--by StateImpact Texas, a collaboration of KUT Austin and KUHF Houston--then quoted Greg Meszaros, the utility’s director, as saying: ""Comparison-wise, about three years worth of Austin’s water use"" was sent to rice farmers that year. That much? Asked the basis of Meszaro’s comparison, utility spokesman Daryl Slusher referred to annual reports on water use from the Lower Colorado River Authority, which oversees water releases from the chain of man-made lakes along the Colorado River running through Austin: Buchanan, Inks, LBJ, Marble Falls, Travis and Austin. By email, Slusher said the reports show that in 2011, the latest year the authority sent water downstream to rice farmers, the provided water was three times the amount of water used by Austin in 2011, 2012 or 2013. According to the authority’s March 30, 2012, report on water use in 2011, the authority that year released 529,580 acre-feet in water for downstream agricultural purposes, including rice farming. That broke down to 433,251 acre-feet let go from the Highland Lakes plus 96,329 acre-feet of water used by farmers from the river alone, the report says. An acre-foot, 325,851 gallons, is roughly equal to the water used by three average Austin households in a year. And the 529,580 acre-feet of water that went to farmers compares to Austin using 168,334 acre-feet of water that year, the report states, including 61,712 acre-feet diverted from the Colorado River at Lake Austin and 106,622 acre-feet obtained from the Highland Lakes under a city contract with the authority. This result suggests the water released to farmers was equal to a little more than three times what Austin used that year. Also, Slusher pointed out that according to the authority, Austin used less water in 2012 (151,495 acre-feet) and even less again (142,027 acre-feet) in 2013, widening the 3-to-1 ratio for those years. Another way to suss Meszaro’s claim, Slusher wrote, lies in adding up the last three years’ worth of Austin’s water use, which gets us 461,856 acre-feet, or 13 percent less than the 529,580 acre-feet released to farmers in 2011. Our ruling Meszaros said billions of gallons of river water released to downstream rice farmers in 2011 equaled about three years worth of Austin’s water use. Equaled or exceeded is the long and short of it. We rate this claim as True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.
