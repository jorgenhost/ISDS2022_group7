Hannity wrong that health care system is ready as is for coronavirus
","Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity celebrated the White House’s response to the novel coronavirus in a recent TV monologue, saying the U.S. health care system is ready for the virus. ""We need to prepare for the worst-case scenario,"" Hannity said on his TV show March 16. ""The president and his task force confirmed they are. Now, as it stands, our health care system has adequate ventilators, ICU beds, medical professionals and ultimately, like I said, we must prepare for the worst, pray for the best.""  That contradicts the warnings of public health experts, who have been sounding alarm about the shortage of ventilators, intensive care unit beds and medical professionals and encouraging Americans to practice social distancing as a way of preventing hospitals from being overrun. Hannity is wrong to say the U.S. has everything it will need, experts said. U.S. hospitals might be able to deal with the number of patients today — although experts we spoke to disagreed on whether that was the case — but the situation will likely look different as it evolves. ""We don’t have nearly enough hospital and ICU beds if there is a surge of cases,"" said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. ""There is no basis for his assertion.""   ""Even a mild surge of COVID patients will stress our ICUs as they have never been stressed before,"" added Eric Toner, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.  The available data suggests that U.S. hospitals are not as well-equipped as Hannity claimed. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people. That ratio puts the U.S. behind other countries — such as China and Italy — that have struggled to keep up with the spread of COVID-19. That doesn’t bode well for the U.S. response to the coronavirus. As of March 16, Italy has seen more than 24,700 confirmed infections and over 1,800 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Hospitals can’t handle the influx of patients, forcing doctors into difficult decisions. In a March 12 op-ed in the New York Times, health policy experts wrote that if 5% of the country catches COVID-19, there will be enough serious cases to overwhelm the health care system. ""If we follow the curve that Italy has followed, in two to three weeks we will no longer have adequate supplies of any of those necessary resources,"" Matthew Wynia, director of the Center for Bioethics and Humanities at the University of Colorado, told us. A March 17 analysis from the Harvard Global Health Institute, ProPublica and the New York Times shows how many beds would be filled in parts of the United States if, over the next six, 12 or 18 months, the coronavirus infects 20%, 40% or 60% of the country.  The projections show that many U.S. cities won’t have enough hospital beds to meet the number of sick patients in need, assuming the virus continues to spread and nothing is done to increase the hospitals’ capacity. Some states will be worse off than others. In the worst-case scenario — where 60% of the population gets sick within six months — the U.S. would need seven times the number of available hospital beds it currently has, the analysis found. Even in a moderate scenario where 40% is infected over 12 months, many cities such as Washington, D.C., would still need to significantly expand hospital capacity. Jha, who worked on that project, told us its findings show Hannity’s claim to be wrong.  The health care system is projected to be overwhelmed by coronavirus patients unless drastic measures are taken. Social distancing and isolation will slow its spread. Here is why that will save lives. pic.twitter.com/R1djQQdpYc Another analysis from USA Today found that ""there could be almost six seriously ill patients for every existing hospital bed"" — and possibly as many as 17 patients per bed.  That examination said the 6-to-1 ratio was a ""conservative"" estimate based on the assumption that all the hospital beds in the U.S. are currently empty. They’re not. ""Our ICUs are currently stretched thin by flu, and we have shortages of nurses and doctors in many parts of the country,"" Toner told us. A February report Toner worked on at Johns Hopkins said the U.S. has approximately 46,500 ICU beds in total.  If the coronavirus spreads at a moderate pace, then 1 million Americans could be hospitalized and 200,000 Americans would ultimately need an ICU, the report said. A more severe scenario could put up to 9.6 million Americans in the hospital and 2.9 million in need of ICUs. A separate Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security report identified about 160,000 ventilators in the country, though not all are full-featured. That includes tens of thousands of ventilators in hospitals nationwide and thousands more in an emergency federal stockpile.  But in 2018, the group estimated that a moderate pandemic similar to the 1957 or 1968 influenza viruses would put about 65,000 people in need of ventilation, and a severe pandemic like the 1918 flu would require ventilators for some 742,500 people. Not all COVID-19 patients will need treatment at the same time, of course. Aaron Carroll, professor at the Indiana School of Medicine, wrote in the New York Times that a key metric is ""the difference between the total number of people who might get sick and the number who might get sick at the same time."" But states and doctors are worried about shortages. Social distancing, shutdowns and other preventative measures to slow the spread are meant to shrink the peak number of cases so hospitals don’t get stretched past their capacity.  Together, we can “flatten the curve” by practicing social distancing, staying home when sick, and washing hands often. This will reduce the strain on our hospitals and emergency rooms, and literally save the lives of our most vulnerable residents. #COVIDー19 #NovelCoronavirus pic.twitter.com/6Yzvg3DONv ""That is why hospitals are cancelling all elective surgeries, planning to expand capacity as much as possible, and even getting ready to make very difficult, battlefield-style triage decisions if it comes to that,"" Wynia said. ""There is an enormous storm coming, and our best meteorologists can’t be sure exactly how big it will be, when it makes landfall, or where it might hit hardest."" President Donald Trump has said the federal government has ordered more equipment and instructed governors to purchase supplies directly if they can get them faster on their own. ""We’ve ordered massive numbers of ventilators,"" Trump said during a March 17 briefing. ""By any normal standards, we have a lot of respirators, ventilators.""  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin listens as President Donald Trump speaks during a press briefing with the coronavirus task force at the White House in Washington on March 17, 2020. (AP/Vucci) Trump said the Army Corps of Engineers is ""ready, willing and able"" to retrofit its facilities and build new field hospitals to care for more patients, saying they could do so ""very rapidly."" In the same briefing, Vice President Mike Pence called on construction companies to donate their masks to local hospitals, and Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the coronavirus task force, said Americans should cancel elective surgeries to ""free up hospital beds and space."" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said March 18 that Trump has pledged to dispatch a Navy hospital ship to New York Harbor to accommodate patients there. Hannity said, ""Now, as it stands, our health care system has adequate ventilators, ICU beds, medical professionals."" That might be true if the U.S. stopped the coronavirus from spreading any further. But given the country’s likely trajectory, experts said all evidence points to the U.S. being short on beds, ICUs, ventilators and medical professionals. The U.S. will need to take steps to slow the spread and expand hospital capacity if it wants to keep its health care system from being overrun by the likely uptick in cases.

Guns not only factor in American Revolution
","Some Revolutionary War events aren’t covered in the Broadway hit Hamilton. Lord Dunmore’s orders happen to be some of them.  Dunmore, Virginia’s royal governor at the time of war, recently had his chance at the limelight when he was compared with Virginia's current Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, on the issue of gun control State Sen. Eric Burlison, R-Springfield, tweeted: ""Anyone who knows Virginia history can see the comparison with Lord Dunmore and @GovernorVA Ralph Northam. Remember, the American Revolution began when they came for the guns. #2ndAmendment"" Burlison tweeted this the day of a gun rally in Virginia.  More than 22,000 people rallied outside the state Capitol on Jan. 20 in protest of gun control legislation Northam supported. Northam supported a bill that called for the ban of certain assault rifles, but it failed in the state Senate on Feb. 17. Other bills, ranging from giving local Virginian governments more ability to ban concealed carry in public places to reporting stolen guns, passed on Feb. 28. We reached out to Burlison’s office. His staff said that the senator did not mean to imply that Dunmore caused the Revolution, so we’re concentrating here on the sentence about guns. They also cited a History.com article as a summary of the war.  Burlison’s tweet seems to simplify an entire revolution. So, we dusted off the history textbooks. Here’s what we found.  This tweet was meant to call back on American history and use it as a cautionary tale — except the tale was taken out of context.  The first battles of the Revolution were on April 19, 1775, at Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts. The town was alerted before the British arrived. Minutemen stood waiting for them — a shot rang out and the scene became violent. We know a few things for sure:  Gen.Thomas Gage sent Lt. Colonel Smith to lead the British troops to Concord.  Gage received a tip that colonial soldiers in Concord were gathering arms.  The British troops were ordered to destroy gunpowder and arrest the colonial rebels John Hancock and Samuel Adams.  What else were the troops after? While one said arms weren't targeted, another said that guns would've been part of the order to confiscate the armory at Concord. A third, University of Missouri history professor John L. Bullion, showed us the written orders. In a letter from Gage to Smith, Gage orders the destruction of guns — and ammunition, flour, tents, pork or beef, carriages and more.  We should probably take a look at Lord Dunmore. After all, Burlison mentions him in the first half of the tweet.  Lord Dunmore, also known as John Murray, was the last royal governor of Virginia. As tensions grew, Dunmore called for the removal of gunpowder stored in local magazines.  Dunmore was then pressured by the hundreds of countrymen that stormed Williamsburg to either return or pay for the lost gunpowder. Dunmore ended up having to pay 330 pounds (or about $56,000 in today’s dollars).  He became very unpopular and was chased out of his home. Dunmore and his family then had to stay on the British ship Fowley.  However, Dunmore is probably better known for his later 1775 proclamation. It announced that a revolution was underfoot and offered freedom to enslaved people if they fought for the British.  WIth politics, money usually becomes an issue at one point. That goes for what leads up to the revolution, too.  Britain won the French and Indian War, but the fighting wasn’t cheap. The 1764 Currency Act said the colonies couldn’t print their own money, but what caused the biggest uproar was the Stamp Act of the next year. The tax was on all printed paper — including newspapers, legal documents and more.  That kicked off a building frustration for colonists over taxes without representation in the British Parliament. That’s not all, though — more acts were added that taxed more products. More soldiers occupied colonists’ homes.  And the British Parliament made clear it could make whatever laws it liked. Things got worse when five colonists died in the Boston Massacre. Soldiers were convicted of lesser crimes, but not murder. Samuel Adams created committees of correspondence to spread the news about the massacre in 1772.  The following year, some Sons of Liberty members snuck on a tea ship in Boston Harbor. They dumped the tea overboard to protest a monopoly given to the East India Tea Company. Britain retaliated. However, colonists encouraged boycotts, and New England began preparing for war. In 1775, British soldiers attempted to take some ammunition but were turned away. Later, word got out to the British that the growing rebellion might be storing military supplies in Concord.  One day after the first battles, Lord Dunmore made an order to get rid of gunpowder. The rest is (literally) history.  Burlison tweeted that ""the American Revolution began when they came for the guns.""  His tweet was a dramatic simplification of history There were many factors at play that sparked the American Revolution. It was caused by a lack of economic freedom and representation in the government and more.  That said, arms may have been one of many factors in the invasion of Lexington and Concord.  We rate this statement as Half True.",/factchecks/2020/mar/18/eric-burlison/guns-not-only-factor-american-revolution/

Despite rates at 0%, Fed still has tools available to stabilize the economy
","With a coronavirus-driven recession in sight, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden lamented what he said was the Federal Reserve’s waning power to stabilize the nation’s economy. During the March 15 debate with rival Bernie Sanders, Biden was asked by Univision journalist Ilia Calderón, ""Just hours ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near 0%, which has not happened since the financial crisis in 2008. Vice President Biden, what would you do?"" Biden called for a major bailout that benefits vulnerable individuals. Then he said, ""We’ve eaten a lot of our seed corn here. The ability for us to use levers that were available before have been used up by this god-awful tax cut of $1.9 trillion. … The Fed will be of little consequence now, they’ve already used what leverage they have, and so we’re going to have to just level with the American people."" It turns out that Biden’s wrong about the Federal Reserve: It does have other arrows in its quiver.  ""What Biden was referring to is what the Fed has done in typical times since the 1970s — moving around the short-term interest rate,"" said Gary Richardson, a University of California-Irvine economist who specializes in the Federal Reserve. ""But the Fed has many other tools it can use."" When we asked Biden’s campaign to explain the remark, they noted that the rest of his answer also addressed fiscal policy — federal spending and taxation — which has been constrained by large tax cuts and high spending during the Trump era. Specifically on the Fed, the Biden campaign pointed to comments made by former Fed chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke in January, which was before a coronavirus-driven recession was widely considered likely. Even in those relatively stable times, Bernanke told an economists’ conference that existing low interest rates reduced the Fed’s flexibility, and Yellen added that ""although monetary policy has a meaningful role to play in future downturns, it's unlikely to be sufficient in the years ahead,"" the Financial Times reported. However, the Financial Times report noted a key caveat that Biden’s remark doesn’t account for. The article said the Fed’s ""alternative tools such as asset purchases and forward guidance were robust.""  First, let’s explain the tool that Biden accurately says the Fed has maxed out. That’s the federal funds rate, the most commonly used, and most direct, lever the Fed can use. The federal funds rate applies to overnight loans between financial institutions. While the fed funds rate doesn’t directly affect consumers, its impact spirals outward as financial institutions set rates that do affect everyday customers, such as those for credit cards, mortgages and other loans. For years after the Great Recession, the Fed set this rate at or near zero in order to promote lending and stimulate the recovery. After a series of step-by-step increases beginning in 2016, the rate was reduced earlier this month to be effectively zero again. So what else can the Fed do to affect interest rates? It can try to shape perceptions about rates over the longer term, and in so doing, help stabilize the economy. One of those tools that has been used regularly since the 2008 recession is known as ""forward guidance."" It’s basically an effort by the Fed to telegraph its future intentions on rate-setting, communicated through a standardized set of public statements and tables. Communicating this clearly to investors provides a greater sense of certainty about the future. The Fed could make this type of announcement at its next regularly scheduled meeting, which is set for April 28 and 29, although it could call an unscheduled meeting sooner. The next tool has been commonly known in recent years as ""quantitative easing.""  It involves the Fed purchasing assets that have longer time horizons, such as U.S. government securities. Less frequently, it can involve buying ""commercial paper"" — short-term IOUs that companies take out to cover temporary cash flow shortages. Indeed, just two days after the Biden-Sanders debate, the Fed announced that it was using this tool. This effort by the Fed ""ensures that companies can get the overnight funding they need to meet short-term obligations like payroll,"" Ernie Tedeschi, policy economist at Evercore ISI, told the New York Times. In 2008, after the collapse of the financial firm Lehman Brothers, the Fed ""intervened in commercial paper in a very large way.  Asset purchases don’t just provide security for stressed companies; they can also be used to affect longer-term interest rates. The Fed can buy assets, driving their price up until longer-term interest rates show the movement the Fed wants.  But sometimes influencing interest rates is not enough, because the economic environment is so bad that institutions are unwilling to make loans no matter what the rate is. ""In times like that, the credit markets can freeze up,"" Richardson said, meaning that credit is unavailable anywhere, and the economy spirals down further. When that happens, there is still more that the Fed can do. One thing the Fed can do to stop that cycle is to get financial institutions to make loans simultaneously, a sign of solidarity that is designed to bolster confidence and spread risk. They can also encourage banks to use the ""discount window"" — a mechanism for banks to get Fed loans at a favorable rate, with the understanding that they will make the credit available to the public. This week, the Fed reopened one mechanism used during the last recession to make short-term loans to banks. The Fed can also make loan guarantees. For instance, it could guarantee loans to strategic industries, so banks can lend more confidently. In wartime, this might mean loan guarantees for companies that make military goods. In the current crisis, it could be used to back loans for companies to expand ventilator production. Some of these emergency powers were limited by the 2010 Dodd-Frank act, which overhauled aspects of the financial services industry, particularly in ways that increased transparency. But the Fed still has significant levers it can use in a crisis. Biden said that because the Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates to near 0%, ""the Fed will be of little consequence now. They’ve already used what leverage they have."" Dropping the federal funds rate to near 0% does make it hard for the Fed to use that particular piece of leverage. But the Fed has other levers. It can telegraph its intentions about longer-term interest rates, it can purchase assets such as short-term commercial IOUs (something the Fed has already begun doing), and it can work with financial institutions to encourage lending and guarantee loans.

Most NC legislators in 'high risk age group' for coronavirus
","To prevent the spread of coronavirus, one state lawmaker wants to take the ""assembly"" out of the North Carolina General Assembly. North Carolina state Rep. Kelly Alexander, a Democrat from Mecklenburg County, suggested on Twitter that legislators should consider video conferencing. The start of the legislature’s session is scheduled for April 28. Alexander posted his tweet on March 11. That same day the World Health Organization labeled the spread of the novel coronavirus as a ""pandemic,"" prompting a wave of event cancellations and changes across the globe. ""With a vaccine a year in the future the General Assembly should use more teleconferences and fewer in person meetings to cut down on potential exposure...after all most of the GA’s members are in the high risk age group,"" Alexander tweeted, adding: ""besides we need to modernize...just saying."" Is it true that ""most"" of North Carolina’s legislators are in the ""high risk age group?"" Alexander never responded to an email from PolitiFact, so we don’t know how he came to his conclusion. Regardless, his tweet is on-point. First, let’s first look at what health experts say about the novel coronavirus (also known as COVID-19) and who’s most at-risk.  The virus causes a fever, cough and shortness of breath in people anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure, according to the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC says people with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung disease are most at-risk. As for age, there’s no specific birth date at which people become more vulnerable. Generally speaking: the older you are, the more likely you are to have complications from the novel coronavirus. That said, top health organizations have defined ""older adults"" as people who are at least 60 years old. The CDC has previously, in a document unrelated to the coronavirus, defined older adults as those over 60. The World Health Organization specifically mentioned people over 60 in its recent report on the coronavirus outbreak in China.  Health experts recently told CNN that the term ""older"" typically refers to anyone over 60. And US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said 60 is the ""average age of people who need medical attention."" It also appears that people older than 60 are more susceptible to complications from the virus. Scientific American reported that patients in China were more at-risk of death if they developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, known as ARDS, after contracting coronavirus. The average age of those who contracted the syndrome was 61. So we know that people who are 60-years-old or older are likely to be more at-risk than other age groups. With this in mind, let’s look at the age of North Carolina’s legislators.  The legislature includes 170 members: 120 in the House and 50 in the Senate. In the Senate, 28 members are 60-years-old or older. In the House, 63 members are older than 60. That means 91 members are aged 60 or older -- which is 53% of the General Assembly. Those numbers come from James White, the House principal clerk, and Sarah Holland, the Senate’s principal clerk. So it’s true that a majority of legislators are 60 or older.  How does that compare to Congress? In the U.S. House, 197 of its 435 members are 60 or older. In the U.S. Senate, 66 of its 100 members are 60 or older. That means about 49% of Congress is at least 60 years-old. Those numbers come from a report by the Congressional Research Service and Jennifer Manning, the service’s senior research librarian. Rep. Alexander said ""most"" North Carolina legislators are in the ""highest risk age group"" for coronavirus. The highest risk age group is generally people who are aged 60 and older. Alexander’s claim is on-point: more than half of legislators are older than that. We rate his claim True.",/factchecks/2020/mar/18/kelly-alexander/most-nc-legislators-high-risk-age-group-coronaviru/

Tony Evers' school funding idea a partial reversal of past position
","Battles over what to do with extra money in the state’s coffers were a hallmark of Wisconsin’s 2020 legislative session. After learning that the state is expected to take in more from tax collections than previously estimated, Republican Senate and Assembly leaders and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers clashed over how to spend a projected $452 million in surplus revenue.  Republicans pushed a tax cut that would have used much of that amount, but Evers vetoed the measure on Feb. 26, 2020. The surplus will now sit in the state’s bank account. But before the veto, the conservative MacIver Institute claimed in a Feb. 12, 2020, email that Evers flip-flopped when he said the state shouldn’t use the funds for ongoing expenses, then proposed using some of it for schools.  We decided this would be a good time to break out our Flip-O-Meter. A reminder: The Flip-O-Meter gauges whether a politician has been consistent on an issue. It doesn’t measure whether any change makes good policy or good politics. Let’s take a look at what Evers said about spending state surpluses. The state learned in early 2020 that it is projected to take in $818 million more than expected through June 2021. Most of that was designated for the state’s rainy-day fund right away, but lawmakers had $452 million to use for extra spending or a tax cut. The surplus is considered one-time revenue, like when a relative dies and leaves you $10,000 in their will. In other words, it’s not guaranteed to be there in the next budget. What’s more, the funding is based on projected tax collections, so the situation could change — for instance as the coronavirus disrupts the economy.  In a Jan. 26, 2020 interview on WISN TV’s UpFront, Evers said it was too early to make a decision about how to use the surplus, but said he wanted to ensure ""we don’t pay for one-time things that somehow next session we’re gonna have to find the money for.""  He also said he wanted to be cautious. So, that’s our starting point on Evers’ views about the current surplus. A week later, Evers asked lawmakers to take up a measure that would allocate $252 million of the extra funds for education and property tax relief, including a boost for rural school funding, school-based mental health services and special education services. The MacIver Institute argues this was a shift in position. ""Initially, I was ecstatic that Governor Evers was going to do the right thing with the surplus and be cautious,"" said MacIver Institute President Brett Healy in a news release. ""What he proposed, however, is not fiscally conservative or smart. Using this one-time surplus to permanently build the base of K-12 education spending will only lead to increased pressure in the future to raise taxes to sustain it."" Jason Stein of the Wisconsin Policy Forum said one-time payments for schools tend to be capital projects or tied to specific initiatives like school safety. But most of the state’s school funding is paid to programs on an ongoing basis, and Stein said Evers’ surplus plan fit that mold. ""In general, it appeared to be increases in ongoing programs and funding,"" he said of the proposal. Not entirely. While Evers shifted his position on use of one-time money for ongoing expenses, he has been consistent on one front: That surplus money should be used to increase funding for schools. The governor similarly pushed in 2019 for a surplus to be used, in part, for funding technical colleges, along with a one-time debt payment and worker training. In Wauwatosa on Feb. 26, 2020, as he vetoed the GOP plan, Evers said he would consider cutting income taxes and reducing state debt — measures pushed by Republicans — but wants any agreement to include school funding and property tax relief. And in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, the governor’s office defended Evers’ statement and plans as consistent with his previous views on surpluses. A spokeswoman also noted that his education proposal called for using only some of the available surplus.  Evers said he wanted to be cautious about the projected surplus and not use it to fund ongoing expenses. A week later, he proposed using some of that money to boost school funding, which at least one outside expert said, as constructed, amounted to an ongoing expense. That amounts to a switch. At the same time, Evers has so far been consistent on what surplus money should be used for: Supporting education. When it comes to how to handle the surplus, we view this as a partial change in position. As such, we give Evers a Half Flip.",/factchecks/2020/mar/17/tony-evers/wisconsin-governor-takes-half-step-back-using-surp/

Biden claimed that Sanders voted against an immigration bill that, if it had passed, would have granted citizenship to 6 million people living in the country illegally. Sanders fought back, saying Biden was talking about a 2007 bill that actually had strong opposition from immigrant rights advocates and another key figure: Barack Obama. ""That bill was opposed by (the League of United Latin American Citizens), the largest Latino organization in America. The Southern Poverty Law Center called its guest-worker programs akin to slavery,"" Sanders said. ""There wasn't really a vote on the bill. It was killed because there was a vote on the Dorgan amendment, I think it was 49-48. And you know who voted with me on that one, Joe? Barack Obama. He understood that that proposal was a bad idea. We don't need slavery in America where workers, guest-workers are forced to stay with their employers."" We wanted to know if Sanders was right about opposition to the bill and Obama’s alignment on this issue. He’s right about groups rejecting the bill and the temporary worker program, but his statement leaves out key details about how he and Obama voted. Overview of the 2007 legislation In mid 2007, Congress deliberated an overhaul of the immigration system that faced opposition from members of both parties. Some Republicans opposed a plan that they said offered amnesty to immigrants. Some Democrats also opposed it, siding with allies in organized labor who were concerned about a provision allowing more non-U.S. citizens to come to the United States to work. A proposed compromise measure provided a path to citizenship for workers illegally in the country, increased border security, strengthened  employment law enforcement, and provided more visas for temporary workers. On June 6, 2007, then-Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., offered what became known as the Dorgan Amendment and which Sanders referenced during the debate. The amendment sought to end a temporary worker program after five years. Dorgan argued it would open the door to more cheap labor and negatively impact American workers. The amendment passed 49-48. Sanders voted for it, and he’s right that Obama also voted for it. However, Sanders didn’t mention that Biden, then also a senator, joined Obama and Sanders in voting in favor of the Dorgan Amendment. Sanders made it sound as if only himself and Obama were on the same side of the issue. Supporters of the broader immigration bill viewed the Dorgan Amendment as a ""deal-breaker."" The bill died soon after, failing to secure enough votes on three separate motions to end debate, a move that would have allowed the bill to go forward. Obama and Biden voted in favor of ending the debate, while Sanders voted against ending debate each of the three times. David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said Sanders’ actions were somewhat perplexing: ""The guest worker program he opposed was gutted, yet Sanders still voted to deny the amended bill a final vote, while Biden and Obama voted to proceed to a final vote. But if the Dorgan Amendment fixed the problem Sanders wanted fixed — as he says — he still hasn’t explained why he voted to stop the bill from passing."" The Sanders campaign sent PolitiFact a link to a May 2007 post from the League of United Latin American Citizens, which said its national board of directors unanimously opposed the Senate compromise bill. In its form, the temporary worker program ""would create a new underclass of easily exploited workers who would be forbidden from realizing the American Dream,"" the group said. In a statement to PolitiFact, the league said it did not support the bill then ""because the guest worker provision created a third-class citizenship."" What about the Southern Poverty Law Center, did it say that guestworker programs were ""akin to slavery,"" as Sanders claimed? The center in 2007 published a report titled, ""Close to slavery: Guestworker Programs in the United States."" Its intent was to flag issues within an existing guestworker program as Congress considered similar proposals. The report was highly critical of the way employees in the existing program were being treated, saying workers were bound to the employers who ""import"" them and lacked access to legal resources. It also said such employees were routinely cheated out of wages, forced to live in squalid conditions, and ""held virtually captive by employers or labor brokers who seize their documents."" The Southern Poverty Law Center  said that the guestworker program was ""inherently abusive"" and if allowed to continue, should be ""completely overhauled."" Sanders said a 2007 immigration bill, ""was opposed by (the League of United Latin American Citizens), the largest Latino organization in America. The Southern Poverty Law Center called its guest-worker programs akin to slavery. … And you know who voted with me on that one, Joe? Barack Obama."" The League of United Latin American Citizens did oppose the bill. The Southern Poverty Law Center called out abuses within an existing guestworker program in a report titled ""close to slavery."" As a senator, Obama did vote with Sanders in 2007 to limit a proposed temporary worker program, but so did Biden. Both Biden and Obama eventually voted on three motions to end debate and move on to a vote on the final immigration bill. Sanders did not vote to end the debate. Sanders’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

","Social media users are misinterpreting a federal disaster relief law to promote a hoax about a nationwide quarantine. A Facebook post published March 16 includes a screenshot of another post from a page called Ninety Degree Turns. It claims that President Donald Trump will soon lock down the entire country to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which had infected 4,226 people in the United States as of March 17. ""Please be advised, within 48 to 72 Hours the president will evoke (sic) what is called the Stafford act,"" reads the post. ""Just got off the phone with some of my military friends down in DC who had a two hour briefing. The president will order a two week mandatory quarantine for the nation."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) The screenshot is similar to a chain message that claims to have information from ""my friend’s aunt"" who works for the federal government. We rated that message False. This Facebook post is wrong, and it gives the wrong impression about the Stafford Act. There is no evidence that the federal government is set to announce a nationwide lockdown like the ones seen in France, Italy and Spain. Trump and the National Security Council have both refuted the claim. So far, officials have advised Americans to practice ""social distancing,"" or avoiding crowded public spaces. In a press conference March 16, Trump outlined several recommendations to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Among them is avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people. ""My administration is recommending that all Americans, including the young and healthy, work to engage in schooling from home when possible, avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people, avoid discretionary travel and avoid eating and drinking in bars, restaurants and public food courts,"" he said. In response to a question, he said the administration is not considering a national curfew or quarantine. He reiterated that point in another press conference March 17. ""It’s a very big step. It’s something we talk about, but we haven’t decided to do that,"" he said. RELATED: 7 ways to avoid misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic The Facebook post also says Trump will soon invoke the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. That part is accurate — the president announced the move in a letter to Cabinet officials on March 13 — but it doesn’t mean there will be nationwide quarantine. ""COVID-19 has the potential to impose a temporary financial hardship on all Americans,"" Trump wrote. ""It is therefore critical that we deploy all powers and authorities available to the Federal Government to provide needed relief."" ""Therefore, as an initial step, I hereby determine, under section 501(b) of the Stafford Act, that an emergency exists nationwide."" The move activates the Federal Emergency Management Agency, authorizes aid to state and local governments, and waives certain regulations that impede access to health care. The Stafford Act is commonly used during hurricanes and does not necessitate a nationwide lockdown. Meanwhile, some places around the country have taken matters into their own hands. In New Rochelle, N.Y., Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered a one-mile containment zone on March 10. In the San Francisco Bay Area, local officials on March 16 announced sweeping measures to try to contain the coronavirus, including a ""shelter in place"" order for residents in six counties. That order is among the strictest in the country, although it fell short of a total lockdown.

Celebrities are sharing a misleading post about Trump’s response to coronavirus
","Democrats have criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic as disorganized and short-sighted. On Instagram, the critics include some celebrities. On March 15, actor and comedian D.L. Hughley posted a screenshot of a tweet that makes several claims about the Trump administration’s actions against coronavirus. ""Dear President Trump,"" reads the tweet, which was published March 13 by an account called Translate Trump. ""YOU cut funding to the CDC; YOU fired the Pandemic Response Team; YOU refused WHO tests; YOU wasted 2 weeks calling this outbreak a ‘Democrat hoax.’"" ""This is a (sic) what a failed public response to a pandemic looks like."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It had more than 42,000 likes as of March 17. (Screenshot from Instagram) In the United States, the coronavirus had infected 4,226 people in 49 states, with 94 deaths, as of March 17. On March 11, Trump announced several sweeping actions to slow the spread of the virus, including a ban on travel from a slate of European countries. Some public health experts have said the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic has been too slow, but are the four claims shown in Hughley’s Instagram post accurate? We looked at each one. The Instagram post has elements of truth but leaves out a lot of important information. We reached out to Translate Trump and the White House for comments, but we haven’t heard back. While it’s not accurate to say that Trump ""cut"" funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is accurate to say he tried. The Trump administration’s initial proposals for the budgets for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases at the CDC — a key player in the fight against coronavirus — have consistently been lower than what was spent the previous year.  However, Congress reshapes presidential recommendations as it sees fit when it crafts final spending bills. Every year since Trump has been president, lawmakers have passed funding bills — which he has signed — that not only exceeded what Trump requested for emerging infections but also exceeded the previous year’s spending. As the chart below shows, funding increased every year from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2020. (We have not included the 2017 proposal, since that was submitted by the Obama administration. The figures for 2020 are preliminary.) On Feb. 24, Trump asked Congress for a $2.5 billion supplemental budget to help combat the emergence of this coronavirus. House Democrats said the amount was insufficient, and instead passed an $8.3 billion bill that Trump signed March 6. The money will fund efforts to develop a vaccine and help local governments respond to the pandemic.  This needs context. ""Fired"" is a strong term for what happened, and Trump recently created a team to lead the government’s response to COVID-19. In May 2018, Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, the senior director of global health and biodefense on the National Security Council, left the administration. He was in charge of the U.S. response to pandemics. After Ziemer’s departure, the global health team was reorganized as part of an effort by then-National Security Adviser John Bolton. Meanwhile, Tom Bossert, a homeland security adviser who recommended strong defenses against disease, left shortly after Bolton arrived.  The White House didn’t replace either White House official or his team. Instead, Trump looked within his administration to fill roles for the coronavirus response.  In January, Trump appointed his Health and Human Services secretary, Alex Azar, to chair a coronavirus task force. On Feb. 26, he announced that Vice President Mike Pence would take charge of the U.S. response to the coronavirus.  This contains a hint of truth, but it’s mostly inaccurate. Former Vice President Joe Biden made a similar claim during the March 15 Democratic presidential debate. A March 6 Politico article says the World Health Organization shipped coronavirus tests to nearly 60 countries at the end of February, but the U.S. was not among them. That is correct, but it suggests that the U.S. would normally have been on the list, which is not the case. ""No discussions occurred between WHO and CDC about WHO providing COVID-19 tests to the United States,"" said WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris. ""This is consistent with experience since the United States does not ordinarily rely on WHO for reagents or diagnostic tests because of sufficient domestic capacity."" RELATED: Fact-checking Donald Trump’s mistakes about European travel due to coronavirus Instead, the U.S. decided to have the CDC develop its own testing protocol, which was published Jan. 28. This caused a lag in testing for the virus in the U.S. The CDC’s test was different and more complicated than a test published in Germany on Jan. 17. It worked in the CDC lab, but when the materials went out to state labs, some of them got inconsistent results. The CDC had to resend packages with new chemical reagents. State laboratories started developing their own tests and were ready to use them, but had to wait for emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration. The combined delays resulted in fewer Americans being tested and a slower U.S. response overall compared with some other countries.  This is inaccurate.  During a Feb. 28 campaign rally in North Charleston, S.C., Trump called the Democratic response to COVID-19 a ""hoax."" But he did not use the term to describe the virus itself. During a press conference Feb. 29, Trump was asked about his remarks. ""I'm not talking about what's happening here; I'm talking what they're doing,"" he said, referring to Democrats. ""That's the hoax."" Trump’s comments feed into a conspiracy theory that claims Democrats and the media are fabricating the threat of COVID-19 to hurt the economy and the president’s re-election chances. And the president appeared to downplay the threat of the virus at several points in recent weeks. But to say that Trump called the virus itself a hoax is false. Plus, the administration took its first action in January by setting up a task force to address the spread of the coronavirus. An Instagram post made four claims that criticize Trump’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first, that he ""cut funding to the CDC,"" is partially accurate; Trump tried to cut the agency’s funding, but Congress prevented it from happening. On the second claim, while saying Trump ""fired"" the ""Pandemic Response Team"" is a stretch, it’s true that National Security Council staffers left abruptly in 2018 and were not replaced.  The third claim, that Trump ""refused WHO tests,"" contains a hint of truth, but is mostly inaccurate since the U.S. does not usually rely on the WHO for testing protocols. And the fourth claim, which says Trump ""wasted two weeks calling this outbreak a ‘Democrat hoax,’"" is inaccurate — the president has not called the virus itself a ""hoax,"" just the Democrats’ response to it. As a whole, the Instagram post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

Mitt Romney says 'Obamacare' adds trillions to the deficit
","How is it that a law can raise taxes and cut spending, but also add trillions to the deficit?

That was Mitt Romney’s claim after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the core of the health care law on June 28, 2012.

""Obamacare raises taxes on the American people by approximately $500 billion. Obamacare cuts Medicare -- cuts Medicare by approximately $500 billion,"" Romney said. ""And even with those cuts and tax increases, Obamacare adds trillions to our deficits and to our national debt, and pushes those obligations on to coming generations.""

Here, we’re fact-checking Romney’s claim that ""Obamacare adds trillions to our deficits and to our national debt."" It’s a topic we’ve researched before.

We asked the Romney campaign for their evidence for this statement, but we didn’t hear back.

For claims about laws that are not yet fully enacted, our go-to source is the Congressional Budget Office. It’s a nonpartisan, widely respected agency with an expert staff that generates projections and reports about how proposed laws affect the federal budget.  

The Congressional Budget Office is not always right in its projections. In recent years, for example, it overestimated how much it would cost to cover prescription drugs for seniors in Medicare. The program actually came in under projections.

But for claims about deficits, we consider the Congressional Budget Office, often called the CBO, to be the standard by which we fact-check claims.

The CBO said this about the health care law back in 2010: It lowers the deficit, by about $124 billion over 10 years.

And in 2011, when Republicans offered a bill to repeal the health care law, the CBO said that increased the deficit, by about $210 billion over 10 years.

Now, is the CBO infallible? Certainly not. And good questions have been raised about some of the CBO’s methods in accounting for the health care law’s effects. We reported on some those concerns in great detail in a fact-check of statement from U.S. Rep Paul Ryan, R-Wisc. He said the law was ""accelerating our country toward bankruptcy."" We rated that Mostly False.

The CBO itself acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding its estimates. Its reports regularly warn that uncertainty increases as it makes projections farther into the future.

And, the Supreme Court ruling may change certain elements of the health care law’s costs, especially as it affects Medicaid spending. Medicaid is the joint federal-state health insurance program for the very poor.

A statement on the CBO website on the day of the ruling said, ""CBO is in the process of reviewing the Supreme Court’s decision related to the Affordable Care Act to assess the effect on CBO’s projections of federal spending and revenue under current law. We expect that this assessment will probably take some time.""

Still, we find no factual basis for Romney’s claim that the law ""adds trillions to our deficits and to our national debt."" We rate his statement False.  ",/factchecks/2012/jun/28/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obamacare-adds-trillions-deficit/

Sarah Palin says Barack Obama once said the individual mandate ""wasn't a tax""
","Moments after the Supreme Court ruled that it was largely upholding President Barack Obama’s health care law, Republicans zeroed in on the court's decision to allow the individual mandate because it is enforced through a tax.

One of the Republicans to speak out was former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the party’s 2008 vice presidential nominee. After the court's decision was announced on June 28, 2012, Palin tweeted, ""Obama lied to the American people. Again. He said it wasn't a tax. Obama lies; freedom dies.""

We aren’t able to fact-check whether ""freedom"" is dying, which is solidly in the realm of opinion.

However, we can check her claim that Obama said the individual mandate, a requirement that people buy health insurance or face a tax penalty, ""wasn't a tax."" That was the basis for the court's decision to uphold the law.

Did Obama say the individual mandate wasn’t a tax?

Given how unpopular taxes are, it’s understandable why Obama would not trumpet the notion that the mandate was a tax.  But has he said it was not a tax?

We could find only one example after Obama was president in which he or a top aide explicitly stated that the mandate wasn’t a tax. (When we asked, the Republican National Committee couldn’t come up with any other examples, either.) The one instance came on Sept. 20, 2009, in an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. Here’s an excerpt:

Stephanopoulos: Under this mandate, the government is forcing people to spend money, fining you if you don’t. How is that not a tax?

Obama: Well, hold on a second, George. Here — here’s what’s happening. You and I are both paying $900, on average — our families — in higher premiums because of uncompensated care. Now what I’ve said is that if you can’t afford health insurance, you certainly shouldn’t be punished for that. That’s just piling on. If, on the other hand, we’re giving tax credits, we’ve set up an exchange, you are now part of a big pool, we’ve driven down the costs, we’ve done everything we can and you actually can afford health insurance, but you’ve just decided, you know what, I want to take my chances. And then you get hit by a bus and you and I have to pay for the emergency room care, that’s…

Stephanopoulos: That may be, but it’s still a tax increase.

Obama: No. That’s not true, George. The — for us to say that you’ve got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase. What it’s saying is, is that we’re not going to have other people carrying your burdens for you anymore than the fact that right now everybody in America, just about, has to get auto insurance. Nobody considers that a tax increase. People say to themselves, that is a fair way to make sure that if you hit my car, that I’m not covering all the costs.

Stephanopoulos: But it may be fair, it may be good public policy…

Obama: No, but — but, George, you — you can’t just make up that language and decide that that’s called a tax increase. … What if I say that right now your premiums are going to be going up by 5 or 8 or 10 percent next year and you say well, that’s not a tax increase; but, on the other hand, if I say that I don’t want to have to pay for you not carrying coverage even after I give you tax credits that make it affordable, then…

Stephanopoulos: I don’t think I’m making it up. Merriam Webster’s Dictionary: Tax — ""a charge, usually of money, imposed by authority on persons or property for public purposes.""

Obama: George, the fact that you looked up Merriam’s Dictionary, the definition of tax increase, indicates to me that you’re stretching a little bit right now. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have gone to the dictionary to check on the definition. I mean what…

Stephanopoulos: I wanted to check for myself. But your critics say it is a tax increase.

Obama: My critics say everything is a tax increase. My critics say that I’m taking over every sector of the economy. You know that. Look, we can have a legitimate debate about whether or not we’re going to have an individual mandate or not, but…

Stephanopoulos: But you reject that it’s a tax increase?

Obama: I absolutely reject that notion.

Sliced up into brief sound bites, the back-and-forth between Stephanopoulos offers some clear evidence of Obama arguing that the mandate is not a tax, most obviously when he says that the mandate ""is absolutely not a tax increase.""

Still, it’s worth noting that Obama made the case that the alternative was worse -- that not having an individual mandate would be unfair and inefficient. The absence of an individual mandate, Obama argued, means passing on the costs of treating Americans uninsured to people who are insured, which amounts to a ""tax"" on those with coverage, even though it may not be literally fit the dictionary definition of a tax. In essence, Obama was brushing off complaints that he was imposing a tax by contending that a ""tax"" was already in place under the status quo.

Our ruling

Palin is correct that Obama ""said (the individual mandate) wasn't a tax."" It’s right there in the video. We rate the statement True.

Limbaugh, GOP have it wrong: Health care law is not the largest tax increase ever
","A silver lining for conservatives in the Supreme Court’s health care decision Thursday is that the court allowed the law to stand based on the idea that the individual mandate was a tax.

That news has Republicans and conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh bringing out an old -- and incorrect claim -- that the health care law constitutes the largest tax increase ever. Rep. Connie Mack, a Republican from Florida running for the U.S. Senate, called it ""the largest tax on the American people in history"" in a press release. Florida GOP congressional candidate state Rep. Gary Aubuchon said on Twitter that the ""ruling confirms Obamacare is the largest tax increase in U.S. history. U.S. Rep. Jeff Landry, R-Pa., put it this way: ""This is the largest tax increase on the poor and the middle class in the history of this country""; and Alabama Republican Party chair Bill Armistead said that ""The United States Supreme Court has essentially created the largest tax increase in American history."" Then there's Limbaugh, who turned up the rhetoric on radio the way only he can. Forget the United States,""Obamacare is nothing more than the largest tax increase in the history of the world,"" he declared. This claim is wrong.

While the health care law certainly is, on the whole, a tax increase, it’s not the largest in American history -- and as such -- cannot be the largest in the history of the world. (Luckily, there's enough U.S.-based research that we don't have to explore the tax increases of the Roman Empire, adjusted for inflation.) We addressed this more than a year ago. But here’s a refresher.

Major tax provisions

The federal Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants, provided members a detailed breakdown of the tax impact of the health care law from 2010-2019.
   
• Starting in 2013, Medicare payroll taxes increase 0.9 percentage points for people with incomes over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly). Also, people at this income level would pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. The 10-year cost: $210.2 billion.
   
• Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called ""Cadillac plans"" (over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families), kicks in. That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019.
   
• Starting in 2011, there's a new fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers. That's expected to raise $27 billion over 10 years.
   
• Starting in 2013, a 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices starts. The 10-year total: $20 billion.
   
• Starting in 2014, a new annual fee on health insurance providers begins. Total estimated 10-year revenue: $60.1 billion.
   
• Starting in 2013, the floor on medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns will be raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income. That's expected to bring in $15.2 billion over the next 10 years.
   
• Starting in 2011, a 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. That's expected to bring in $2.7 billion over the next 10 years.

There also is money in the law going the other way. The plan includes government money, in the form of tax credits, to subsidize the cost of health insurance for lower-income people who don't get insurance through their employer. For the record, many Republicans and tax experts argue those shouldn't count as tax cuts. And there is a tax cut for some very small businesses that allows them to write off a portion of the cost of providing insurance to their employees.
   
Combined with various other revenue-generating provisions, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the health law will bring in more than $437.8 billion by 2019. The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the additional revenues coming in to the government to be $525 billion between now and 2019.
   
Does that translate to the biggest tax increase in American history?
   
Comparing tax impacts of legislation
   
First, we need to set some goal posts. There are many ways to define or measure the size of a tax increase, and not all tax increases have been measured the same way over time. The health care tax provisions, for instance, take effect between 2011 and 2018, meaning the full effect of the legislation won't be felt until near the end of the decade. On top of that, it doesn't make sense to compare 2019 dollars to 1985 dollars. You have to adjust for inflation, or express the amount as a total of Gross Domestic Product at the time, which is a way to measure the relative impact of a tax provision at the time it was enacted.
   
To make matters even more complicated, there are tax cuts that are direct results of tax increases, and vice-versa. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), for example, was passed largely to reverse revenue losses from the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA).
   
For our comparison, we used a method perfected by Jerry Tempalski, an analyst in the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In 2006, Tempalski tried to determine the relative impact of major tax revenue bills from 1940-2006. He used revenue estimates from Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation and calculated the impact as a percentage of GDP.
   
For 1940-1967 calculations, he used a single-year snapshot of the revenue impact of the tax legislation. For more recent tax bills, from 1968-2006, Tempalski used a two-year average of the revenue effects. Tempalski wrote: ""The comparison of tax bills for the first period should be examined with some caution, because the revenue estimates are from different sources and are not completely consistent. The comparison for the second period can be viewed with more confidence, because the estimates are relatively consistent.""
   
As a percent of GDP, here are the top five tax increases from 1940-2006, according to Tempalski:
   
    1. Revenue Act of 1942: 5.04 percent of GDP;
   
    2. Revenue Act of 1941: 2.2 percent of GDP;
   
    3. Current Tax Payment Act of 1943: 1.13 percent of GDP;
   
    4. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP;
   
    5. Excess Profits Tax of 1950: .97 percent of GDP;
   
And here are the top five tax increases from the ""modern"" era of 1968-2006:
   
    1. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP;
   
    2. Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982: .8 percent of GDP;
   
    3(t): Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980: .5 percent of GDP
   
    3(t): Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993; .5 percent of GDP;
   
    5: Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990; .49 percent of GDP.
   
The 2010 health care law
   
The list obviously does not include the health care law, which passed in 2010, and a spokeswoman for the Department of Treasury says it hasn't been updated. So we calculated our own percent of GDP figure. We used 2019 as our baseline because that's when all of the tax provisions of the law will be in effect. In 2019, the CBO estimates, the government will see increased revenues of $104 billion. We then divided that number into the projected GDP for 2019, which according to the CBO economic forecast is $21.164 trillion. That would mean the tax increase provisions of the health care law would amount to .49 percent of total GDP.

Depending on your rounding, that would mean the tax increases resulting from the health care law would be about the size of tax increases proposed and passed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter, in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush and in 1993 by President Bill Clinton.
   
The health care-related tax increases are smaller than the tax increase signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1982 and a temporary tax signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. And they are significantly smaller than two tax increases passed during World War II and a tax increase passed in 1961.
   
The tax increases in the health care legislation do reverse a trend of federal tax cuts and represent the first significant tax increases since 1993. But they are not the largest in the history of the United States. And -- despite what Limbaugh said -- that means they cannot be the largest ever in the history of world. Limbaugh's inflated rhetoric takes a wrong claim and puts it into the realm of the ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire. UPDATE: Some readers noticed that our initial analysis of Limbaugh’s claim failed to include references to the penalty that people who declined to purchase health insurance would be asked to pay. After all, the Supreme Court declared that penalty a tax.

The CBO figure we used for our calculation, a total of $104 billion in revenue generated in 2019, is inclusive of all revenues, including the penalty or tax individuals might pay if they do not purchase health insurance. The figure for that year was estimated to be $14 billion for penalties paid for by employees and individuals.

Baldwin says Thompson said he wants to ‘do away with Medicare’
","
U.S. Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic congresswoman from Madison, painted Republicans as enemies of the elderly in a red-meat speech at a convention of liberal bloggers and activists.

""As progressives let’s be clear -- on Social Security we are committed to protecting it, not privatizing it,"" Baldwin told Netroots Nation during its June 7, 2012, meeting in Providence, R.I. ""And on Medicare we are committed to strengthening it, not ending it as we know it.""

She slammed former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, the frontrunner among four GOP Senate contenders, for his work on behalf of drug and insurance companies after leaving the cabinet of President George W. Bush.

And Baldwin dropped a stunner into her remarks about the ex-guv:

""Just this week, one of my prospective opponents, Tommy Thompson, went to a tea party event and compared Medicare to welfare, and said he wanted, quote, to do away with Medicare,"" Baldwin said.

She added, with a touch of outrage: ""Do away with something the middle class has worked for, has paid for and has earned.""

That will get your attention -- whether you’re in Medicare, nearing eligibility or even years away.

Did Thompson really express a desire to end Medicare, the long-running government-run health care program for seniors funded by taxes that come out of workers’ paychecks?

Thompson’s comments

As backup, Baldwin’s campaign cited Thompson’s remarks at a June 4, 2012, gathering of the Lake Country Area Defenders of Liberty.

The Oconomowoc-based group decries excessive government and has a stated goal of ""demolishing the growing, socialist ‘nanny state’ and its programs and legislation, re-instituting personal responsibility and the traditional values of work, merit, integrity, honesty, innovation, accountability, civic participation and civility.""

The Democratic Party filmed the speech and Baldwin’s campaign provided a copy to us.  A brief portion of the speech is linked on the website of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

At the event, Thompson said Medicare will be broke within a decade and the only way to save it is to give people who turn 55 starting in 2022 a choice of traditional Medicare or purchasing health insurance with a subsidy from the federal government.

If that sounds a lot like the plan from U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, to reform Medicare, it should. Thompson has endorsed Ryan’s plan.

Baldwin used cautious words when she described the Ryan plan, saying it would end Medicare ""as we know it."" Others have claimed it would simply
""end"" Medicare, which PolitiFact National named the 2011 Lie of the Year.

So, Thompson’s remarks -- in a way -- turn the claim on its head. It’s a Republican suggesting he would end Medicare.

There is another piece of background: Thompson didn’t say it at the event, but he told the Journal Sentinel in 2011 he firmly believes seniors will choose the private insurance option under Ryan’s plan over government-run care.  Of government-run healthcare, he said he’s ""always opposed"" it.

Back to the speech.

Thompson did, as Baldwin claimed, wrap his argument for Medicare reform in the language of wiping it away and starting fresh.

First, he harkened back to his days as Wisconsin governor, and his first-in-the-nation move to replace welfare with a work requirement.

He told the audience the United States should ""change Medicare and Medicaid like I did welfare."" (We previously rated as Mostly True Thompson’s claim that he ""ended welfare"" in Wisconsin).

Then there was this line, the one Baldwin latched onto:

""Who better than me, (who’s) already finished one of the entitlement programs and come up with programs to do away with Medicaid and Medicare.""

We asked the Thompson campaign about the claim and they said it was not a misstatement by the candidate. But campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir offered this somewhat contradictory explanation: Thompson used the phrase ""doing away with"" in the context of ""changing"" Medicare, not eliminating it, he said.

The speech itself is hard to decipher. Was Thompson describing his position in support of Ryan’s plan as a way of fundamentally changing Medicare? Was his characterization meant to apply to changes he helped make in Medicare when he was the U.S. secretary of health and human services?

In his 2011 remarks, Thompson said government-run Medicare could disappear if people are allowed to opt out of it.

Is that what he meant?

Whatever his meaning, it’s clear that Thompson was comfortable uttering the phrase ""doing away with Medicare"" in the middle of a recitation of his views on transforming the program.

At the same time, it’s clear that further into the speech, after the statement in question, Thompson said he was interested in ""saving"" it from fiscal extinction.

He also framed his views as wanting to ""change"" Medicare, though in the context of his elimination of welfare in Wisconsin.

Baldwin doesn’t provide those facts. Her comment that Thompson would ""do away with something the middle class has worked for, has paid for and has earned"" suggests Medicare will be taken away without any option.

Our rating

Baldwin claimed that Thompson ""said he wanted, quote, to do away with Medicare."" He did say it, acknowledges he did not misspeak, and Baldwin accurately repeats the phrase.

Still, Baldwin leaves out evidence from Thompson’s own mouth that Thompson is talking about a dramatic transformation of Medicare in order to save government health care assistance to seniors, not end it outright.

The Truth-O-Meter definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

We think that fits Baldwin’s claim.",/factchecks/2012/jun/28/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-says-thompson-wants-do-away-medicare/

Michael Doherty says evidence is lacking that red-light cameras in New Jersey reduce accidents
","
Big Brother, New Jersey Sen. Michael Doherty has his eye on you.

And the Warren County Republican isn’t the only one watching those eyes in the sky known as red-light cameras.

Enough people have questioned the reliability of the cameras that the state Department of Transportation on June 19 suspended a five-year pilot program for the devices because of concerns about yellow light timing with most of the cameras in the state.

But Doherty has questioned the cameras’ reliability for some time, citing concerns about privacy, revenue and actual impact on reducing collisions.

""There is little if any evidence that the use of red light cameras in New Jersey has reduced the number or severity of accidents at the intersections where they are used,"" Doherty said in a May 14 news release about a bill he introduced to ban the cameras in New Jersey.

So far the evidence seems stacked in Doherty’s corner, PolitiFact New Jersey found

First, some data about the cameras: they work with a traffic control device to photograph or record vehicles that disregard a red signal. Police review the images to verify if a violation happened. Summonses are mailed to drivers. Communities and the companies that installed the cameras share the revenue.

In New Jersey’s case, we reviewed a November 2011 report presented to the Legislature about the first year of the cameras’ effectiveness, through June 1, 2011. A second-year report has not yet been sent to the Legislature, according to DOT spokesman Joe Dee.

At the time of its report, the DOT noted that just two intersections (of 59 studied) – both in Newark -- had been recording violations for a full year: Broad and Market streets, and Broad Street at Raymond Boulevard.
Crash and accident cost data for both locations prior to the cameras’ installation and after showed decreases of near 50 percent for three types of crashes and damages cost decreases of $149,000.

But the DOT questioned that data.

""Although these calculations suggest a potential positive effect on safety as a result of the pilot program, we believe the data are too limited to draw any meaningful conclusions at this time,"" the report states. ""The Department therefore recommends continued data collection and monitoring of RLR (Red Light Running) program intersections.""

We also reviewed studies and data from organizations such as the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Safer Streets L.A., the National Motorists Association and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety that address concerns that more accidents result at camera-controlled intersections, in part because the yellow signal isn’t long enough.

""Providing adequate yellow time and a brief phase when all signals are red is important and can reduce crashes, but those things alone don't eliminate the need for or potential benefits of red light cameras,"" the Institute says on its website. ""Studies have shown that increasing yellow timing to values associated with guidelines published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers ‘can significantly decrease the frequency of red light violations.’""

""One of our main objections to the use of red light cameras is that often they provide a perverse incentive for jurisdictions to refrain from implementing effective safety countermeasures such as an increase in the yellow phase timing because it would result in a decrease in violations and consequently a decrease in revenue,"" Jay Beeber, executive director of Safer Streets L.A., said in an e-mail.

Steve Carrellas, spokesman for the New Jersey chapter of the National Motorists Association, said a properly engineered intersection is a better deterrent for crashes than red-light cameras.

Our ruling

Doherty claimed, ""There is little if any evidence that the use of red light cameras in New Jersey has reduced the number or severity of accidents at the intersections where they are used."" A state DOT report showed some decreases in certain types of crashes and the costs of damages, but emphasized that the data collected through June 1, 2011 is too small to make definitive decisions about the cameras’ effectiveness. We rate Doherty’s statement True.

Barack Obama says income for top earners up 275 percent since 1979
","
While campaigning this month in Cleveland, President Barack Obama reframed his general election fight with Mitt Romney as a battle between the haves and the have-nots.

Casting himself as a champion for the latter, Obama argued that his Republican opponent embraced fiscal policies that helped steer the country into recession.

The election, he said, will be ""a make-or-break moment for America’s middle class.""

The address at Cuyahoga Community College followed remarks that same afternoon from Romney in Cincinnati. Combined, the events offered a preview of how each will spend the coming months positioning himself as the candidate who can steer an economic recovery.

The dueling speeches were considered far and wide to represent a key moment, given that it was the first time Obama and Romney had campaigned in the same state on the same day.  Leaving aside the rhetoric, PolitiFact Ohio decided to look closer at the numbers the president used to make his case. In particular, two figures Obama shared at Tri-C caught our attention.

""Over the last few decades,"" Obama said early in his 53-minute speech, ""the income of the top 1 percent grew by more than 275 percent -- to an average of $1.3 million a year.""

The president had painted a picture of inequality. But was it an accurate one?

Let’s start with the first half of the statement. Data released last October by the independent Congressional Budget Office shows that, on average, those Americans among the richest 1 percent saw their after-tax household income rise 275 percent between 1979 and 2007.

Those not quite as prosperous but nonetheless among the top 20 percent saw income grow by 65 percent over that period. Middle-class incomes grew roughly 40 percent. And among the bottom 20 percent, income was about 18 percent higher in 2007 than in 1979.

So while income increased across the board, the top 1 percent easily outpaced the pack.

""As a result of that uneven income growth, the distribution of after-tax household income in the United States was substantially more unequal in 2007 than in 1979,"" the CBO reported. ""In fact, between 2005 and 2007, the after-tax income received by the 20 percent of the population with the highest income exceeded the after-tax income of the remaining 80 percent.""

The second half of Obama’s statement can be traced to a report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 developed countries that sets international standards on a wide range of topics.

The report, released in December and titled ""Divided We Stand: Why Inequality Keeps Rising,"" found that, on average, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans earned $1.3 million a year after taxes. Though Obama didn’t mention it in his speech, that figure dwarfs the average $17,700 made by the poorest 20 percent, according to the OECD.

Before we get to the Truth-O-Meter, there are three points worth raising.

First, while Obama said that growth for the richest 1 percent was more than 275 percent, the CBO study adds no such quantifier. The president indulged in some hyperbole, but not so much that it created a false impression that the disparity is measurably larger than it is.

Second, Obama time-pegged his assertion to ""the last few decades."" Obama’s speech focused singularly on the policies of his Republican predecessor, George W. Bush. Also in the White House during those decades were two Democrats: Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.

The third point comes via the Washington Post. When fact-checking Obama’s Tri-C speech, the Post’s Glenn Kessler noted that while it’s accurate that the average income among the top 1 percent is $1.3 million, describing top earners that way is ""an interesting sleight of hand.""

According to the CBO, you’re in the top 1 percent if your household income exceeds $352,000. ""By using an average,"" Kessler wrote, ""Obama is able to cite a much higher figure.""

But it’s also important to stress that the numbers Obama used come from agencies respected for independence. These three points, while helpful in painting a fuller picture, do not diminish the accuracy of the numbers or the context in which the president delivered them. Knowing them, though, provides some clarification.

As such, we rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/jun/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-income-top-earners-275-percent-1/

Does TriMet itself say that free rides for high school students do not add to operating costs?
","
The TriMet Board recently adopted a budget that does not include free transit passes for Portland high school students. This week, Portland Mayor Sam Adams shot back with a ginormous fee increase on TriMet benches and shelters so he can provide the free passes. 

The YouthPass program is a big deal to Adams, who says transit access is critical to keeping teenagers in school and connected. In a statement released Tuesday, the mayor argued that providing passes for roughly 13,000 Portland Public Schools high school students doesn’t add to the transit agency’s operating costs.

""In fact, TriMet's own analysis shows that YouthPass does not actually add to the transit agency's costs. No new buses, MAX trips, additional routes or drivers are needed to accommodate YouthPass riders,"" he said.

TriMet’s own analysis showed that? This we had to check.

PolitiFact Oregon contacted Caryn Brooks, the mayor’s spokeswoman. She turned up an Oct. 25, 2011 memo from an ECONorthwest economist to Claire Potter, TriMet’s director of financial analysis. The memo, commissioned by TriMet, explains the economic impact to the transit agency should it provide the passes without state support.

Some quick background: Portland Public Schools has long provided free transit passes for low-income students. The concept was expanded under Adams in fall 2009 to include all PPS students. The state of Oregon paid for most of the $3.4 million program through a business energy tax credit; Portland Public Schools paid $800,000 of that.

The arrangement ended in December 2011, at which point the City of Portland, Portland Public Schools and TriMet cobbled a plan to keep it running through the school year.

Here’s the part of the ECONorthwest report that the mayor highlights: ""The provision of free passes to PPS students likely did not affect TriMet's operating costs in a significant way. Discontinuing the provision of free passes is unlikely to result in operating cost savings.""

In other words: The report states the agency saves no money if it stops providing free rides. Adams is correct about that.

But the analysis also shows that TriMet loses out on a potential $1.9 million in fare money from students in 2012-13. And that’s based on a monthly pass price tag of $27, wrote TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch in an email. The price is scheduled to increase to $30 a month in September.  

The ""additional cost is not what TriMet is concerned about -- it is the foregone passenger revenue, in the range of $2 million,"" Fetsch said.

She’s right that the analysis is about the potential hit to TriMet’s revenue stream. And Adams knows that, because he’s proposed an 8000 percent increase in shelter and bench fees to squeeze $2 million out of TriMet, which he would then use to reimburse TriMet for the cost of the student passes.

The mayor’s statement is accurate. But we think it needs additional information. Providing free student passes will not add to TriMet’s operating costs in the form of more drivers or bus routes, but it will deprive the transit agency of revenue once provided by other public agencies.

The statement is accurate but needs extra information. We rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/jun/27/sam-adams/does-trimet-itself-say-free-rides-high-school-stud/

John Carter says Constitution gives Congress sway over immigration policy so Obama lacked authority to defer deportations of young illegal immigrants
","
John Carter, among Republican critics of an Obama administration move potentially enabling hundreds of thousands of young illegal residents to avoid deportation, sees a constitutional hitch.

On June 18, 2012, the Round Rock congressman told Austin’s KLBJ, 590 AM: ""The Constitution of the United States... specifically states the Congress shall write legislation for immigration policy in the United States."" Carter added that the Democratic president did not have the authority to act as he did.

Is that right?

In telephone interviews, lawyers versed in the Constitution and U.S. immigration laws told us that while there is no explicit language in the Constitution saying immigration policy shall be set by Congress, Article I, Section 8 has long been interpreted as giving Congress that role. The fourth clause of the section says Congress shall have the power to establish a uniform ""Rule of Naturalization,"" as in determining who can legally be in the country. 
By email, Carter spokesman John Stone agreed the same section was the basis of Carter’s claim.

That authority settled in gradually, according to a 2009 primer on U.S. immigration laws published by the Federal Judicial Center, which promotes research and education related to the federal courts. States often imposed their own restrictions, the primer says, until Congress began regulating aspects of immigration in 1875.

""Over the next forty years, Congress created broad categories of excludable aliens, a narrower class of deportable aliens, and the beginnings of an immigration bureaucracy,"" the primer says. In 1921, Congress added numerical restrictions, and in 1952, Congress codified immigration laws; this was followed by a comprehensive overhaul in 1980 and actions in 1986 enabling millions of illegal immigrants already in the country to attain legal status while establishing sanctions on employers of illegal immigrants, according to the primer.

So, Congress has the power to write immigration laws, as Carter says.

Is it also correct, as Carter told KLBJ-AM, that the Obama administration overstepped its constitutional authority?

Stone, Carter’s spokesman, said by email: ""I assume you would agree that the president has absolutely no authority to change any law. If you contend a president has authority to interpret and enforce law as they see fit, Congress and the voters be damned,... you have just endorsed a dictatorship to replace our republic, and destroyed the American rule of law.""

According to a half-dozen legal experts we consulted, the administration’s move can be legally justified.

At issue is a June 15, 2012, memo from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano directing immigration officials not to try to deport young immigrants illegally in the country who had not otherwise run afoul of the law. ""As a general matter, these individuals lacked the intent to violate the law,"" Napolitano’s memo says, adding that her directive, based on the government’s authority to apply ""prosecutorial discretion,""  is needed to ""ensure that our enforcement resources are not expended on these low priority cases but are instead appropriately focused on people who meet our enforcement priorities.""

As a result of that action, hundreds of thousands of residents under age 30 already in the country illegally could be permitted to apply to stay for two-year, renewable intervals, also qualifying to apply for work permits. Napolitano’s memo refers to this status as ""deferred action.""

Napolitano closed with language that strikes us as insistent there is no new law being written by the executive branch: ""This memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship. Only the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights. It remains for the executive branch, however, to set forth policy for the exercise of discretion within the framework of the existing law. I have done so here.""

Similarly, Napolitano said in a June 15, 2012, interview with CNN that none of the beneficiaries would be put on paths to citizenship. ""Not at all,"" Napolitano said. ""In fact, that's where Congress needs to act. We continue to urge the Congress, you know, pass the DREAM Act,"" which would create a path to citizenship for certain young illegal immigrants.

The lawyers we interviewed by phone told us that while Congress makes immigration laws, the executive branch has the authority to enforce the laws by applying prosecutorial discretion -- in this instance, directing officials to grant young low-priority illegal residents ""deferred action"" standing.

Ben Winograd, a staff attorney with the American Immigration Council, which favors an expansion of legal immigration, said: ""The president certainly had the authority to act as he did. He didn’t create any new laws.""

Jamin Raskin, an American University law professor, said: ""The president has not sought to change the citizenship status or legal residency status of the  young people he’s talking about. All that he’s done is to prioritize the enforcement agenda of the executive branch.""

Disclosure: Winograd told us he personally supports Obama but speaks to the law mindful that he advises the non-partisan council. Raskin described himself as an Obama supporter poised to serve on the rules committee at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. Neither man said his personal politics controlled his judgment on this issue.

Michael Olivas, a University of Houston law professor, said the Obama administration is offering to defer removal actions against qualified immigrants just as previous administrations have done so. He forwarded a link to his paper being published by the William & Mary Bill of Rights Journal quoting research by Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, a Penn State University professor expert in immigration law, indicating that according to records obtained through open-record requests, President George W. Bush’s administration employed ""deferred action"" an average 771 times in the years 2005-2008, while the pace dropped to 661 per year on average during the first years of the Obama administration.

Philip Bobbitt, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas School of Law, pointed us to a June 22, 2012, blog post by Washingon appellate lawyer John P. Elwood in which Elwood says that presidents generally have the power to categorically enforce laws. Yet, Elwood is uncertain that specific provisions of immigration law allow Napolitano to exercise her discretion as announced in her memo. His post closes with his hope that the Office of Legal Counsel, the U.S. Justice Department’s arm devoted to providing ""authoritative"" legal advice to the president and executive branch, issues an opinion on the legal basis for the administration’s action.

In a telephone interview, Elwood, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel, told us that deferred action has been offered in the past to categories of individuals who share similar plights such as Chinese immigrants who were in the U.S. in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 or immigrants fleeing civil war in Liberia.

""I don’t think you can say as a general matter, the president doesn’t have such authority,"" Elwood said. ""The bigger question is whether this exercise"" by Napolitano ""differs from the past categorical exceptions, if it is a bridge too far.""

Wendy Davis says Texas lawmakers cut off basic health care for “hundreds of thousands of women”
","
""Those in charge in Austin are failing to invest in our future,"" state Sen. Wendy Davis told the Texas Democratic Party convention June 9, 2012.

Among the examples in the Fort Worth Democrat’s speech: ""Hundreds of thousands of women no longer have access to basic medical care, life-saving cancer screenings and contraception.""

That sounds like a large-scale, life-threatening concern. We asked Davis how she reached her conclusion, and learned that she was referring to 2011 budget cuts to the Texas Department of State Health Services’ family planning program.

Spokesman Anthony Spangler emailed us a collection of links to news stories as well as letters, memos and Davis’ written responses.

According to the program’s website, the services it provides include a health check and follow-ups on health problems as well as contraception, counseling and tests for cervical cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV and diabetes.

Department spokeswoman Carrie Williams told us by email that clients must fall under 250 percent of the federal poverty level to receive help through the program. By 2012 guidelines, that would translate to an annual income of $57,625 for a family of four.
  
The funding cuts, according to an April 24, 2011, Associated Press news article and a May 24, 2011, news article in the Austin American-Statesman, emerged in April 2011 when some of the Republican-led House's most conservative lawmakers pushed a series of floor amendments, shifting money from family planning services to programs for poor and disabled children, anti-abortion-rights programs and crisis pregnancy centers.

Spangler sent us a May 5, 2011, memo from the Legislative Budget Board estimating that 283,909 women would lose basic health care in the 2012-13 biennium if the program got $37.9 million from the state instead of $99.6 million listed in the first version of the budget taken up by lawmakers. The board has not made a more recent estimate, spokesman John Barton told us by phone.

State Health Services bases its calculation on slightly different figures. Williams told us that because the family planning program’s 2010-11 budget was $111.5 million, the Legislature’s approval of $37.9 million for 2012-13 was a decrease of $73.6 million. Williams said that dividing that number by $205 -- the average cost per client -- and taking into account that 95 percent of clients are women, the department estimates the program would serve 160,000 to 180,000 fewer women per year.

The full effect of the cuts won’t be felt until next year, Williams said, because the department was allowed to carry over $5 million from the 2011 budget to ease the transition. Precise data were not immediately available, but the one-time money helped provide services to ""thousands"" of women, she said. Going by the $205-per-client cost, it appears the number could be up to 23,000.

Spangler also sent us a March 8, 2012 report from the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities that put the per-year number at 150,000. Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the center, said her group used budget board numbers from the 2012-13 state appropriations act and State Health Services’ 2012 operating budget.

In sum: Assorted estimates say between 137,000 and 180,000 women are losing State Health Services family planning in 2012. For 2013, estimates range from 150,000 to 180,000.
  
Considering that Davis said the women ""no longer have access,"" we sought to determine how many of those women already have been affected by the cuts.

Davis told us that women lost coverage when the 2011 budget changes took effect September 1, 2011. Williams told us 157 of the State Health Services program’s 300 clinics have closed and that whereas in the first half of fiscal 2011 the state program had served 116,410 people, in the first half of fiscal 2012 it had served 34,185.

So, from September 2011 to June 2012, some 82,225 fewer people, almost all of them women, got services through the state program than from September 2010 to June 2011, Williams said. She said the department can’t estimate whether more clinics might close.

Davis told us that when she spoke, she was not limiting her count to the women already no longer getting services previously funded through the Department of State Health Services. Instead, she said, she was speaking to the projected effect of the adopted budget cuts through the two-year budget period ending Aug. 31, 2013. She said that because the 2011 Legislature’s cut has been enacted and, short of an unlikely special session, won't be reversed, hundreds of thousands of women will be denied care during the two-year period covered by the budget.
  
It’s one thing for the services singled out by Davis not to be provided by Department of State Health Services-supported clinics.

We asked the senator how she knows hundreds of thousands of women no longer have access to such services from any providers. Davis said, ""The women accessing health care through family planning services turned to the DSHS services because they have no other options. That option no longer exists.""

Separately, we tried -- and failed -- to get a sense of how many women have no resource for health care including cancer screenings and contraception other than the State Health Services family planning program, but did not come up with specific counts or estimates.

Williams at State Health Services and Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, said they have numbers on how many women use their departments’ programs, but not on how many women have access to alternatives.

News stories Spangler sent us from the Texas Observer, a liberal-oriented news magazine, and from the Austin Chronicle weekly newspaper described women who relied solely on state services, but gave no numbers other than Legislative Budget Board projections, which include the assumption that the women would not find equivalent services elsewhere.

Planned Parenthood officials in Texas whom Davis suggested we contact, as well as the group’s statewide public affairs coordinator, Dyana Limon-Mercado, said they could not estimate the exact number of women newly lacking access to services.

Kelly Hart, director of public affairs for Dallas-based Planned Parenthood of North Texas, to whom we spoke by phone, described the difficulty in finding such an estimate: ""Access"" can depend on circumstances such as the woman’s income, her transportation options, how far away a clinic is and what hours it’s open. Another concern, perhaps particularly in pre-natal care, is how long women must wait for appointments. ""At this point we don’t have the data,"" she said.

In a 2010 fact-check, PolitiFact Texas gave a Mostly False rating to Gov. Rick Perry’s statement that ""Everyone in this country has access to health care."" Federal law requires hospitals to treat emergency medical conditions, and other avenues exist for non-emergency health concerns; however, many people cannot get to them and millions do not get the care they need.

Texans’ state-funded options for family planning services could be further reduced if federal courts let the state enforce its February 2012 rule excluding Planned Parenthood clinics from Texas’ Medicaid-financed Women’s Health Program. That legal battle won’t be resolved until this fall at the earliest.

But in any case it’s unclear how many Texas women would be affected: possibly more than 50,000, as the Statesman wrote in an April 17, 2012, news story, or perhaps none, if the state is able to fulfill its promise to serve the same number of women by taking over the program November 1, 2012, and operating it entirely with state dollars.


Our ruling

Davis overstated the number of women who have already lost services, at least as provided by State Health Services-supported clinics; the best information available suggests it’s closer to 83,000. Then again, through August 2013, the state projects that more than 200,000 women will lose access to the state's family planning services, and it seems likely they have few other options.

Romney says median income has dropped 10 percent in last four years
","
Milking an opponent’s mistake is a campaign staple, especially if you happen to be a presidential candidate visiting the Dairy State.

During his June 18, 2012, trip to Janesville, presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney again mocked President Barack Obama’s recent declaration that the private sector is ""doing fine.""

And he used a recycled line to make his case that Obama was dead wrong in his perception.

""The median income in America has dropped by 10 percent in the last four years,"" Romney told a sweat-drenched crowd at a manufacturing plant, ""even as gasoline prices have doubled and the prices on many things we buy have gone up and up and up.""

Romney used the same line about falling incomes in a GOP presidential debate on January 23, 2012. It earned a Half True from PolitiFact National, which said the numbers were outdated by six months, somewhat off the mark and from a respected but unproven data-analysis firm.

We wondered what the numbers look like now, with another 10 months in the books.

In this case, we’ll look only at the income trend, not to what degree Obama is to blame for any decline. In Janesville, Romney surely was out to criticize Obama, but his remarks show it was more for being out of touch than saying he was responsible for creating the problem.

The gold standard of income data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey -- Annual Social and Economic Supplements. But it is generated only once a year, so it is not very timely. The 2011 data is not out yet. More on that later.

In both instances, Romney turned to household income figures generated by a private economic research agency, Maryland-based Sentier Research. The firm uses other Census Bureau income data that is released monthly and adjusts it to provide a more timely look at income trends. Its reports have become widely quoted in media accounts.

In January, and again in Janesville, Romney said he was comparing changes in the ""last four years,"" which takes us to different periods in the George W. Bush presidency as the starting point. We examined Sentier’s reports from April 2008 to April 2012, the latest available from the firm at the time of Romney’s speech.

The inflation-adjusted median household income declined 8.3 percent when comparing those two points in time, a decline of $4,596 per household.

So by the latest numbers in the report Romney used, he’s in the ballpark but off more than a percentage point.

Case closed? Not quite.

Romney’s campaign told us  relied on a reference to earlier Sentier research that was highlighted in an April 30, 2012, Bloomberg news report.

That piece referred to February 2012 data from Sentier showing a 9.7 percent drop compared with the same month in 2008. The big swing in just a couple months is not unusual in the month-to-month data.

So, as in the presidential debate reference, Romney was very close using outdated data, but high compared to the latest data available when he spoke.

Either way, according to the Sentier data, the income trend has gone the wrong direction in the last four years. Median household incomes move up and down, but overall trended sharply downward during Obama’s first two and a half years before recovering somewhat since summer 2011, according to the firm’s index.

The more standard source of income statistics, the annual Census Bureau data, has figures only through 2010 because 2011 is not out yet. That survey asks people in the spring what they earned for the previous calendar year.

Using that annual data for a four-year comparison going back to 2007, incomes declined 6.4 percent from 2007 to 2010.

Because the reference periods are different, the trends identified by the annual census data can’t really be compared directly to monthly census data that Sentier uses.  

PolitiFact National has examined in detail the data source that Romney uses, Sentier Research. The firm is run by two retired Census Bureau officials (one of whom, Gordon Green, directed the income statistics program) whose work has been cited in many national news publications. Sentier’s client list has included major government clients and think tanks on both sides of the ideological spectrum.

Economists have said the Sentier-created income index fills a knowledge gap in a timely way, but still has to stand the test of time.

Our rating

Romney chided Obama for being out of touch, saying that median household incomes have fallen 10 percent. He uses data from a reputable private firm that used census data to create a new income index.

At one point in Obama’s term incomes were down about 10 percent from four years earlier, but the decline is now closer to 8 percent, based on the firm’s data. Romney continues to use the outdated figure, making the decline sound somewhat larger than it is.

We’ll stick with the Half True rating he received in January, based on the Truth-O-Meter definition of a claim that is ""partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.""",/factchecks/2012/jun/27/mitt-romney/romney-says-median-income-has-dropped-10-percent-l/

New Jersey’s unemployment rate is the 5th highest in the nation, senator says
","
As Gov. Chris Christie and Democratic legislators battle over cutting taxes for the fiscal year beginning Sunday, both sides have been turning to federal labor statistics to make their case.

Claiming that the ""Jersey Comeback"" has begun, the Republican governor recently called for an income tax cut by pointing out how the state gained 17,600 nonfarm jobs in May. Christie received a False on the Truth-O-Meter for claiming that job growth represented 25 percent of the net new jobs created nationwide that month. 
The Democrat-controlled Legislature on Monday approved a fiscal year 2013 budget that sets aside $183 million for a tax cut, but said taxes only would be reduced if Christie's revenue projections are met between now and December. While discussing how the projections appear to be ""overly optimistic,"" state Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen) cited New Jersey’s unemployment rate.

""The state's unemployment rate is fifth-highest in the country, a full point above the nationwide rate and higher than all of our...neighboring states,"" Sarlo, chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, said during a speech on the State Senate floor.

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Sarlo’s statistic is accurate.

With an unemployment rate of 9.2 percent in May, New Jersey had the fifth-highest rate among the 50 states, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. New Jersey’s unemployment rate also was one percentage point higher than the national unemployment rate of 8.2 percent in May, according to the bureau.

The only states with higher unemployment rates were Nevada (11.6 percent); Rhode Island (11 percent); California (10.8 percent); and North Carolina (9.4 percent), the bureau said.

Just as Sarlo said, New Jersey’s unemployment rate was greater than in its neighboring states, according to the bureau.

New York had an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent, followed by 7.4 percent in Pennsylvania and 6.8 percent in Delaware, the bureau said.

Here are the top 10 highest unemployment rates in May among the states: 
  
Now, here are the states with the top 10 lowest unemployment rates in May: 
  
For the individual states, the unemployment rates for May are preliminary.

It’s worth noting that New Jersey’s unemployment rate has dropped slightly in recent years. In February 2010 -- Christie’s first full month as governor -- the unemployment rate was 9.7 percent, according to the latest figures from the bureau.

Our ruling

In a speech on the State Senate floor, Sarlo claimed: ""The state's unemployment rate is fifth-highest in the country, a full point above the nationwide rate and higher than all of our...neighboring states.""

According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the senator’s claim is on target. In May, the Garden State had an unemployment rate of 9.2 percent, marking the fifth-highest amount among the 50 states.

New Jersey’s unemployment rate also was higher than the national employment rate by one percentage point and greater than the rates in New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware.

Jim Renacci says Obama has racked up more debt than any other president
","
A lot of claims are circulating about government spending and the federal debt, usually in statements attacking or backing the policies of President Obama. 
PolitiFact has looked at a number of the claims and found that their accuracy varies widely -- mostly because Obama’s record on federal government spending is a lot more flattering than is his record on debt.

We found it was inaccurate to claim, as Mitt Romney did, that ""since President Obama assumed office three years ago, federal spending has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history.""

In fact, Obama has presided over the slowest growth in spending of any president in the past 60 years using raw dollars, and the second-slowest if you adjust for inflation.

But we also found that while spending is poised to be increasing by 1.4 percent per year under Obama, the debt will be increasing by 14.6 percent per year. The reason? Year by year, federal revenues haven’t been keeping up with spending, due to the struggling national economy (which has held back tax revenues) and a continuation of tax cuts. And each year there’s an annual deficit, the national debt grows.

That led to the frequently cited -- and wrongly exaggerated -- claim that the debt has increased more under Obama than under all previous 43 presidents combined.

It also led to this blog posting by Rep. Jim Renacci, the Republican incumbent facing Democratic incumbent Rep. Betty Sutton in Ohio's newly redrawn 16th congressional district:

""In less than one term, (Obama has) racked up more debt than any president in history — over $5 trillion.""

The statement interested PolitiFact Ohio because it was less sweeping and more specific than
many others.

Responding to our inquiry, Renacci's staff cited a CBS News story from March, which compared the debt growth under Obama's three years and two months in office to eight years under George W. Bush.

On Jan. 20, 2009, the date Obama took office, the debt stood at $10.6 trillion. At the time of the CBS story, it had increased by $4.9 trillion.

By  the day Renacci's statement was posted, the Treasury Department's online ""Debt to the Penny"" calculator showed the debt at more than $15.7 trillion -- an increase of $5.1 trillion.

During the two terms of the Bush presidency, whose debt exceeded all predecessors, the debt rose $4.899 trillion.

So Renacci's numbers checked out.  
But Renacci's statement that Obama ""racked up"" the debt, fails to account for factors beyond Obama's control.
Obama did approve the stimulus bill and a deal to extend tax cuts, both of which contributed to the debt.

Not surprising though, that Obama’s Treasury Department blames most of the current debt on decisions made under Bush, including tax cuts (which it says cost the government $3 trillion), the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (which it tallies at $1.4 trillion) and the Medicare prescription drug program ($300 billion).

They may have a point that there is plenty of blame to spread around. It is clear that some elements of the increase in the debt are a result of decisions made before this administration took office.

And it’s worth noting that the president doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Legislation that increases spending, such as the extension of the tax cuts, requires approval from Congress. In the case of the tax cuts, that support came from both Republicans and Democrats.

Experts note, too, that the weak economy has contributed to the debt, given the reduction in federal revenues and greater spending on items like unemployment benefits.

Renacci is accurate in asserting that the national debt has increased since Obama took office by more than $5 trillion, more than any previous administration.

But his statement assigns direct control -- and blame -- to Obama. Lost in that is the impact of the faltering economy, decisions made before Obama took office and the fact that others, such as Congress, also have had a role in increasing the debt.

Is Big Brother spying on us? Candidate says yes and blames congressman
","
A Republican primary candidate for Congress calls himself a friend of the tea party.

The incumbent? A friend of Big Brother.  

Michael Opitz, a Cobb County Air Force veteran and activist, is one of two Republicans challenging U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey for his seat in Congress. One of his YouTube videos says the Republican congressman from Marietta is voting away your privacy rights. 

The nearly two-minute video is a slide show of surveillance imagery, including an illustration of the Statute of Liberty using binoculars and a still photo of the creepy antagonist from ""The Matrix."" 

The accusation is set to the Hall and Oates’ tune ""Private Eyes."" It appears in text:

Gingrey ""Gave Government the Power to Electronically Spy on YOU, YOUR FAMILY, the Average US Citizen. All YOUR Private Information Collected. Analyzed. Graphed. Categorized. STORED. Without a Warrant,"" it said. 

Are private eyes watching you? Do they see your every move? 

PolitiFact Georgia asked Opitz for more information on how Gingrey has given the government the power to ""electronically spy on you, your family, the average U.S. citizen."" 

The video touched on other issues, but since privacy was the ad’s main issue, we’ll focus our inquiry on this subject.

Opitz pointed PolitiFact Georgia to the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, otherwise known as CISPA. 

CISPA, or H.R. 3523, gives private companies such as Internet service providers, telecommunication companies, commerce sites and social media networks permission to share certain information with the federal government without a warrant. 

In light of other changes in privacy laws and the development of new technologies that can catalog and track personal information, Opitz considers CISPA a big step down the road to tyranny. 

""This is George Orwell’s ‘1984’ on steroids,"" Opitz said. 

CISPA allows corporations to give intelligence agencies information on cyber and national security threats. The information can also be used to stop child exploitation and protect people from bodily harm.  

Gingrey co-sponsored CISPA, which passed the House on April 26. It has yet to clear the U.S. Senate. President Barack Obama has threatened to veto the bill.

Gingrey campaign manager Jonathan Klein said the bill contains privacy protections.

""Because of the dramatic rise in cyber attacks, this bill is designed to protect critical U.S. infrastructure, not ‘spy’ on unsuspecting families,"" Klein told PolitiFact Georgia in an email.  

We found Opitz’s claim had shortcomings. 

It’s premature to say that Gingrey ""gave"" the government more opportunities to look at consumers’ private information. CISPA is stalled in the Senate. 

In addition, the bill’s language specifies that it does not give the federal government the power to collect ""all"" of your private information, as Opitz said.  

But Opitz raises a valid point. Whether those restrictions will do enough to protect John Q. Public’s Google searches from being collected and cataloged is a hotly debated matter. 

CISPA lists types of information the federal government may not use, including firearm sales, book sales, tax returns and medical records. It also says that the feds may not save or use information for purposes other than what the bill describes. 

Paul Rosenzweig of the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation thinks Opitz’s claim is wrong. Allowing more information sharing is not the same as giving more power to the federal government, he said. 

Rosenzweig also pointed to language in the bill that says that information will be subject to ""anonymization."" Personal information would be stripped from the information that corporations hand over. 

""If you believe the government will completely go crazy, that’s a ‘Minority Report’ scenario that will never happen,"" Rosenzweig said. 

Still, opponents and supporters of CISPA agree that there is legitimate dispute over whether the privacy protections are tough enough.  

CISPA is written to protect corporations who opt to share information with the feds from lawsuits by consumers. This feature may make companies less scrupulous about withholding personal information such as your membership in an anti-abortion group or that you marched at an Occupy Wall Street rally. 

Opitz’s video makes a valid point, said Rainey Reitman, who directs advocacy against the bill for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. 

""He does it dramatically, but it is a correct criticism,"" Reitman said. 

Under CISPA, corporations, not the consumer, decide what the government gets to see, said Michelle Richardson, an attorney who has been fighting the bill for the American Civil Liberties Union.  

""It does completely shift the presumption of privacy of the American citizen,"" Richardson said. 

Where does this leave Opitz? 

Opitz said that Gingrey ""Gave Government the Power to Electronically Spy on YOU, YOUR FAMILY, the Average US Citizen.""

Opitz’s rhetoric is overheated, and a few of his facts need tweaking. CISPA hasn’t passed the Senate, so if the bill is designed to give the government additional powers, then it hasn’t done it yet. In addition, the bill contains language that supporters say will prevent government spying. 

But he does raise a legitimate criticism of CISPA. The bill’s protections may not be enough to keep average Americans safe from Hall and Oates’ private eyes. 

Opitz’s statement raises real issues. But he overstates some key points, and it could use a lot more context.

Does Salem traditionally wait 'until the money is almost gone' to pay for education?
","
Education is pretty much always in vogue in Salem, with politicians clamoring they are for it, not against it.

For example, Rep. Shawn Lindsay, R-Hillsboro, issued a press release last week, highlighting support from local school board members. He strongly believes that the K-12 budget should be approved early in the legislative session, say March or April, so that districts can start making plans.

""Families across Oregon set priorities and pay for the most important things out of their bank accounts first, not last,"" noted Lindsay (in the release). ""Yet in Salem they have traditionally waited until the money is almost gone to pay for the most important things in our state’s budget.""

That didn’t sound right. Lawmakers, as far as we know, do not parcel out money on a vote-as-they-go process. Instead, chief budget negotiators on the Joint Ways and Means Committee have a rough idea of how much they can spend for the next two years, and they start piecing the puzzle, knowing they have a minimum for some programs.

In an interview with PolitiFact Oregon, Lindsay said the Legislature has a history of approving budgets for lesser needs -- natural resources, employment department, housing -- before passing a K-12 schools budget. He thinks the process should be reversed. 

""The education budget is held until late in the session after less important budgets have been pushed out early. Those less important budgets are pushed out early so there’s less money in the coffers,"" he said.

Again, that continues to sound inaccurate. We turned to Ken Rocco, Oregon’s legislative fiscal officer. He’s the person who works with legislative budget co-chairs to piece together a spending plan for Oregon, a job he’s done for a long time. The 2011-13 general fund and lottery budget, for some perspective, is nearly $15 billion with $5.7 billion for K-12 schools.

Rocco confirmed what PolitiFact Oregon suspected.

Lawmakers know roughly what they have to spend. If they agree to a budget figure for K-12, that needs to fit within an overall budget that contains enough money to keep prisons open, provide social and health services, and pay for the state patrol. In other words, no individual budget exists in a vacuum.

""You need to have an overall plan,"" Rocco said. ""You can pass the K-12 budget first, but you still need to know what that leaves for the rest of state government.""

Schools have been receiving a shrinking share of general fund and lottery money, as other needs have grown. There’s no question there’s politics in budgeting, as legislators fight over issues such as compensation, regulations and standards. And there have been legislative sessions when K-12 was among, if not, the last budget to pass -- but not because that was all the money that was left over in the end.

We leave you with one final thought before our ruling. In 2011, lawmakers approved a schools budget early in the session, allowing the governor to sign it in April. But Lindsay did not vote for it. He said that while the early approval gave certainty to school districts, the amount was inadequate in his opinion.

Do legislators in Salem traditionally wait ""until the money is almost gone"" to pay for important programs, such as schools? They do not.

Obama says DREAM Act hasn’t changed since Republicans supported it, only politics has
","
The debate over immigration was revived by President Barack Obama’s announcement of a reprieve for the children of illegal immigrants. So, too, was talk of the DREAM Act.

In a speech to Hispanic elected officials in Orlando on June 22, 2012, Obama criticized Congress’ inaction on the bill.

""We should have passed the DREAM Act a long time ago,"" he said. ""It was written by members of both parties. When it came up for a vote a year and a half ago, Republicans in Congress blocked it. The bill hadn’t changed. The need hadn’t changed. The only thing that had changed was politics.""

We decided to check Obama’s history on the DREAM Act.

The federal Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act pertains to children brought to the U.S. illegally by parents or relatives. If the young people have stayed out of trouble and were in school or the military, the legislation would allow them to move to legal status and not be deported. It has been proposed every year for more than a decade but never passed Congress.

Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, introduced the original bill in 2001, along with Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. It drew 18 co-sponsors, Democrats and Republicans.

Obama was correct that the legislation was written by both parties.

The more recent vote he referred to took place in December 2010. The House passed the DREAM Act by 216-198. Only eight Republicans voted for it; 160 voted against. In the Senate, it could not garner the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster and died 55-41 on Dec. 18, 2010, largely along party lines.

The Republicans who voted for it were Richard Lugar, R-Indiana; Bob Bennett of Utah, who had already lost his Senate seat; and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, who kept hers by running as a write-in candidate after losing in the primary.

But we should also note that five Democrats voted against it. Those five votes could have gotten the DREAM Act to a floor vote.

So how much has it changed in all this time?

Durbin’s office provided us with a list of revisions, which were made at the request of Republicans. They included:

• Lowering the age cap from 35 to 30 on who could be eligible.

• Specifically excluding anyone who has committed one felony or three misdemeanors; has engaged in voter fraud or marriage fraud; or has abused a student visa.

• Requiring a medical exam and background check.

• Requiring applicants to speak, read and write English.

In other words, the changes tightened eligibility standards and made the law stricter overall, which would support Obama’s point.

Roy Beck, president and founder of Numbers USA, which advocates for the interests of American workers in immigration legislation, acknowledged that changes to the law over time addressed ""loopholes.""

""I think it’s correct there were some improvements in that area,"" he said.

But Beck also noted that the original version of the bill set the age cap at 21. It was raised to 35 in subsequent years, then lowered back to 30.

""The age limit has varied quite a bit, and that’s not small,"" Beck said. ""How many people are you going to be adding to the workforce to compete with Americans?""

Frank Sharry of America’s Voice, a group that favors comprehensive immigration reform and passage of the DREAM Act, agreed that there were ""small changes"" to the bill.

Sharry pointed out that the age limit has been raised to accommodate immigrants who were 21 when the bill was first introduced, so they would still be eligible. He said Durbin then lowered the cap to try to attract more votes in Congress.

As for the politics surrounding the bill, that has certainly changed.

Some Republicans who supported the DREAM Act are no longer in the Senate or have lost primaries, including Indiana’s Richard Lugar and Bob Bennett of Utah, swept out by the tea party movement, which generally shows little tolerance for any form of amnesty and advocates deporting illegal immigrants and building a border fence.

Others who supported the bill early on have now backed away, including Hatch, the original sponsor. When the Senate bill was introduced in 2011, not a single Republican signed on.

Depending on your point of view, that could be good or bad.

Said Beck: ""They have changed their mind on some of these things, but good for them.""

He argues that the economic downturn was the driving force for many Republicans’ change of heart.

In 2001, ""we we didn’t have 20 million Americans who were unemployed or forced into part-time work,"" Beck said. ""I think through the years as the numbers got larger, they became aware of how out of sync an amnesty like this is with high unemployment.""

Our ruling

Obama said the DREAM Act was written by members of both parties and since then has been blocked by Republicans, even though ""the bill hadn’t changed, the need hadn’t changed. The only thing that had changed was politics.""

The president is correct that Democrats and Republicans worked on the original bill and it had bipartisan support in Congress for several years, though never enough to pass. In 2010, most of the opposition was on the Republican side, but five Democrats helped sustain the filibuster in the Senate.

And there have been minor changes to the legislation, most importantly an increase in the age cap from 21 to 30. Other revisions made the bill more restrictive, and thus in theory more appealing to conservatives.

Finally, there’s no question that the political debate about immigration has evolved, with the tea party surge crowding out more moderate viewpoints and even pushing some Republicans out of office.

Obama’s comment glosses over some of the details, but his statement is largely correct. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/jun/26/barack-obama/obama-says-dream-act-hasnt-changed-republicans-sup/

Chain email says River School lip-reading instructor confirms first lady Michelle Obama said ""All this for a damn flag"" at 9/11 ceremonies
","
Authors of chain emails love to question President Barack Obama's patriotism.

They've said he refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance (False), that he ""turns his back to the flag and slouches"" (False), and that he complained that U.S. troops were whining about going to war. (Pants on Fire).

(We are not including the claim that Obama fits the biblical description of the Antichrist, since it's theoretically possible that you could be the Antichrist and still be patriotic.)

We've also noticed a sub-genre of emails that attack First Lady Michelle Obama for living a life of luxury, such as the claim that she ordered $400 worth of caviar and lobster at the Waldorf Astoria in New York (Pants on Fire).

Now comes a new twist on a claim that sprouted a year ago in the conservative blogosphere: the suggestion that during 9/11 memorial ceremonies, the first lady could be seen saying to her husband, ""All this for a damn flag.""

The controversy has been fueled by video that shows the first lady saying something to her husband. Because the comments are not audible, critics of the Obamas have speculated about her words. On YouTube, a video that has been seen 1.4 million times slows the exchange and declares the first lady said, ""All this for a damn flag"" and that the president replied ""Hm … mn …. nnnn"" and gave a ""nod of disapproval.""

The Blaze, Glenn Beck's website, invited readers to do their own lip reading and speculate what they thought Michelle Obama was saying. The results of the 38,706 votes: 
  
  
The new email, which emerged about one month ago, indicates Michelle Obama's words have been confirmed by ""a lip-reading instructor at the River School, a Washington school for the deaf.""

Here's the full email (it has two subject lines because senders added a second line when forwarding it)::

Subject:  Obama's wife - Caught in the Act

You be the judge,  
How much more disrespect can there be?

Subject: Obama's wife as seen by deaf people

READING HER LIPS !!
Obama and his wife were attending The 9/11 Memorial Ceremony and watched as the Color Guard folded the flag into a triangular shape, according to custom.

A video camera caught the two from the sidelines.  Obama's wife leaned over and said to him, ""All this for a damn flag?""  Obama turned to her, smiled smugly and nodded his head in agreement.

How do we know what was said? The video was presented for translation to a lip reading instructor at The River School, a Washington D.C. school for the deaf.

The video is shown at normal speed, 3/4 speed, and 1/2 speed with no banners obstructing her lips.  

The current Commander and Chief and the First Lady proud of being American? You be the judge...

Like many chain emails, this one has evolved since earlier versions. The detail about the lip-reading instructor at the River School was added recently, presumably to give the email more credibility.

But that credibility crumbled when we spoke with Nancy Mellon, director of the River School. She described it as a Washington school that serves a wide range of children from 18 months to third grade. It is known for its strong program for hearing-impaired children, but they account for just 15 percent of the students.

More importantly, the River School doesn't teach lip-reading, Mellon said, and no one from the faculty has provided any interpretation of the video.

""It's definitely not us,"" she said. ""We would never try to do anything like this.""

The school has gotten so many inquiries about the chain email that last week it posted this message on its website:

Please be advised that The River School was not involved in any translation services for a recent video clip currently circulating on the Internet. 
So what did she really say? The consensus on All Deaf, a website for people who are hearing impaired, was that she said, ""It's amazing how they fold that flag."" (However, one person speculated that she told her husband, ""This is the third time this week you left your underwear on the floor... I ain't your mother."") 
Our ruling

Like many chain emails we've checked, this one is so flimsy that it needs to fabricate its credibility. Critics of Obama are free to speculate about the first lady's words, but the ""damn flag"" translation was not done by anyone at the River School.

So we give this one a nod of disapproval -- and a Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2012/jun/26/chain-email/river-school-lip-reading-damn-flag-first-lady/

Workers' Voice says Josh Mandel faces FBI investigation
","
Josh Mandel’s campaign is not under FBI investigation.

But Democrats, labor unions and their allies keep suggesting the Ohio treasurer is.

The latest comes from a ""super PAC"" affiliated with the AFL-CIO, called Workers’ Voice. The AFL-CIO helped form the political committee and administers it from its headquarters in Washington with donations from member unions and supporters, according to records it filed with the Federal Election Commission as well as press reports.

The PAC spends money on political advocacy ads, such as a recent online ad that said that Mandel, a Republican running for U.S. Senate, is under investigation for shady campaign practices.

Specifically, Workers’ Voice on June 19 announced it was spending $100,000 for an ad appearing on Cleveland.com (the online home of The Plain Dealer), the Akron Beacon Journal’s website, Google and Twitter. The ad was a spoof on Nike’s ad featuring LeBron James, which carried the theme, ""We are all witnesses.""

The anti-Mandel ad’s title was, ""Witness the Mandel investigation.""

This was a reference to an investigation of donations that employees of a North Canton direct marketing company made to Mandel’s campaign to unseat incumbent U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat. The ad says people should ask that Mandel ""come clean on campaign cash,"" and the ad asks: ""When did Josh Mandel know his campaign was being investigated by the FBI?""

The problem here? Mandel’s campaign is not being investigated by the FBI. The FBI specifically told us this.

Rather, the FBI is investigating employees of Suarez Corporation Industries who gave donations to Mandel totaling $105,000, and to U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci. PolitiFact Ohio separately addressed the same claim when the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee made it against Renacci, and ruled it was False.

The size, number and timing of donations to Mandel from Suarez employees on June 2, 2011, caught the attention of Democrats and reporters last summer. They wondered whether the employees could really afford the donations and if the employer had actually supplied the money and used his workers to hide that fact. If so, it would violate federal campaign finance laws that limit the size of donations and require the true identity of each donor.

Suarez and his employees have denied wrongdoing.  The Toledo Blade first reported on the contributions in August 2011.

Facing ongoing criticism from Democrats, Mandel in May returned the donations, citing an abundance of caution. Critics say Mandel’s campaign should have suspected the donors might be in violation of the law when it first received the checks.

That’s an assertion of judgment. PolitiFact Ohio is interested in assertion of fact.

Is Mandel under FBI investigation?

""No,"" Andrew Hayden, the supervisory senior resident agent of the FBI’s Canton office, told us on June 21.  ""He is not and he has not been. What we’re looking at is contributions to both campaigns from employees of the Suarez Corporation. Neither the Mandel campaign nor the Renacci campaign are under investigation.""

Brown, the incumbent senator, came close to making the same claim as in the Workers’ Voice ad, but he caught and seemingly corrected himself. In an interview with Findlay, Ohio, radio station WFIN-AM on June 21, Brown said of Mandel: ""He is under FBI investigation,"" then quickly added, ""or his campaign contributions are under FBI investigation.""

Even that milder assertion suggests Mandel is implicated. But you could tie yourself up in knots over Brown’s phrasing, whereas Workers’ Voice left no room for even that.

While the ad states in one part that the FBI is investigating donations to the Mandel campaign, it then asks: ""When did Josh Mandel know his campaign was being investigated by the FBI?""

And it had the title, ""Witness the Mandel investigation.""

We sent AFL-CIO spokesman Michael Gillis an email to ask about the wording. He replied, ""Any contribution includes a contributor and a recipient. Josh Mandel’s campaign was the recipient, and is therefore being investigated by the FBI as a party in that transaction.""

The FBI presumably knows whom or what it is investigating, and was clear on this. It is not investigating Mandel.

To say otherwise is False. ",/factchecks/2012/jun/26/workers-voice/workers-voice-says-josh-mandel-faces-fbi-investiga/
