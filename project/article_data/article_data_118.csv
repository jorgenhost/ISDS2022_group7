Reports that Donald Trump’s unsecured Android phone is root of White House leaks are made up. Fake!
","A fake news report claiming that President Donald Trump’s unsecured Android cell phone is probably the source of several news leaks from the White House is actually the fabrication of a well-known source of contrived stories. A Feb. 26, 2017, article on TheSeattleTribune.com says in a headline, ""Trump’s Android device believed to be source of recent White House leaks."" The post was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially false, as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat fake news. The readers got this one right. The story is fake. The story says two ""private intelligence agencies"" have determined that several news leaks that have been damaging to the Trump administration — from plans for executive orders to internal fights with staff — likely came from the president’s own phone. But TheSeattleTribune.com is a website that makes up their stories, and is associated with another faux news site called AssociatedMediaCoverage.com. Their disclaimer says the website ""is a news and entertainment satire web publication"" and that all articles ""are fictional and presumably satirical news."" If the counter on the story is to be believed, this one has been viewed more than 171,000 times in less than a week. It’s been used in online forums and also is popular on Facebook. It’s even appropriated a Twitter hashtag. The article claims #DitchTheDevice is an online effort by social media users to get Trump to quit using the phone. But really, that hashtag was formerly used to try to get people to stop staring at their phones all day long and enjoy life a little bit more. In any event, that’s what the hashtag means now, as thousands of people have used it while tweeting out TheSeattleTribune.com link. The story keys off a maelstrom of news about leaks from the White House, combined with Trump’s penchant for tweeting and his reported actual use of an unsecured Android phone. But this story? It’s fake. We rate it Pants On Fire!",/factchecks/2017/mar/03/theseattletribunecom/reports-donald-trumps-unsecured-android-phone-root/
"['Crime', 'Missouri', 'Eric  Greitens']","
Greitens takes crime statistics out of context
","The FBI releases its Uniform Crime Report every year. And every year politicians, news outlets and pundits use it to rank cities by their rate of violence, despite FBI cautions against doing so. This year was no different. In his first State of the State address, Missouri Republican Gov. Eric Greitens used the data to make a point: The state has a crime problem. ""Three of the 11 most violent cities in the U.S. are in Missouri — St. Louis, Kansas City and Springfield,"" Greitens said. ""And it’s not just in the cities. When you talk to sheriffs, chiefs of police and front line officers around the state, they’ll tell you it’s getting harder to do police work."" We wondered if the statistic was true. Were Missouri’s three largest cities also some of the most violent in the country? The limits of comparing cities Taken at face value, the crime reporting data paints a bleak picture of crime in the state. If you were to compare the rate of violent crime for U.S. cities with a population of at least 100,000, Greitens would appear to be on target. In 2015, the most recent year with available data, St. Louis was in first place with a crime rate of 1,817 per 100,000. Kansas City came in 10th place (1,417 per 100,000) and Springfield in 11th (1,355 per 100,000). However, according to Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at University of Missouri-St. Louis, rankings should be taken with a grain of salt. ""Crime statistics are simply not accurate enough to, for example, meaningfully distinguish city number five from city number six or seven in a ranking of city crime rates,"" Rosenfeld said. ""But they can be used to compare the crime rates in cities of similar size and demographics."" Let’s take, for instance, the 50 largest cities in the country. Detroit, with a population of 673,225, had the highest rate of violent crime, at 1,759 per 100,000. Kansas City fell in 6th place. But St. Louis isn’t even included on that list. The city, which does not include the smaller, suburban cities around the downtown area, is the 57th largest city with a population of 317,095. And Springfield, with a population of 166,860, isn’t anywhere near as large as Kansas City (473,373). Why does this matter? One reason is that any increase in crime has a larger effect on smaller populations than it does on more populous areas. An increase of 200 more violent crimes in Springfield would bump the city up three places on the list. The same hypothetical increase for Kansas City bumps it up one place. Over the last few years, Kansas City and St. Louis have remained around the same spot on the rankings, give or take two or three ranks. Springfield, however, was in the 27th spot in 2012. To Greitens’ credit, if you were to compare these cities to other cities with about the same population, the three have higher than average crime. St. Louis’ crime rate was 2.5 times the average rate of violent crime for cities with a population of 250,00 or more. Kansas City’s was a little under twice the average rate. ""Springfield has surprisingly high crime rates,"" Rosenfeld said. Compared to the average rate of violent crime for cities with between 100,000 and 250,000 people, Springfield had almost three times as much violent crime. Rosenfeld said much of that has to do with poverty. ""When you see high levels of poverty, you tend to see high levels of crime,"" he said. Almost 55 percent of kids in the Springfield R-12 school district qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, a measure of poverty, according to data from the Missouri Department of Education. Because factors like crime and other underlying characteristics vary from city to city, even the FBI says it’s unfair to rank them on a single variable like crime. ""Data users should not rank locales because there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place,"" reads an FBI disclaimer. ""UCR statistics include only jurisdictional population figures along with reported crime, clearance, or arrest data. Rankings ignore the uniqueness of each locale."" The disclaimer lists several dozen different factors, including economic conditions, citizens’ crime reporting practices and population density. ""Cities are considerably different from another based on things like demographics, tourism, commutes,"" said James Alan Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University. Where does the city end? Because crime doesn’t respect political boundaries, presenting data from a crime-infested area as an exact reflection of an entire city can be misleading. The FBI estimated the St. Louis metro-area population at 2.8 million in 2015, and Kansas City’s was a little more than 2 million. Yet the populations considered in the crime reporting data were 317,000 for St. Louis and 473,000 for Kansas City. One of the problems is the extent to which nonresidents spend time in the city’s center, Fox said. Suburbs have a moderating effect on the data, so crime rate can depend on how many suburbs are included in the city’s jurisdiction. For St. Louis, that appears to be the case. Sam Dotson, the police chief of the St. Louis Metro Police Department, said the Uniform Crime Reporting statistics are ""absolutely not"" reflective of crime in the region. Unlike almost every major metropolitan area in the country, St. Louis city is independent from its county. In 1877, the two split after a contentious and narrow vote among county residents and city voters, many of whom were tired of the extra tax burden from the county. ""When St. Louis city made a decision to separate itself, it was political,"" Dotson said. ""We’re living with the repercussions today."" The county crime data has an equalizing effect. If you were to combine the county with the city, St. Louis’ crime rate would fall to around 44 on the list, Dotson said. He did not deny that the city has a crime problem, which he said has everything to do with the city’s level of poverty. ""We have crime,"" Dotson said. ""We have too much crime. So does everywhere else. To single us out is wrong."" Dotson also disagreed with Greitens’ comments blaming crime on the ability of police departments to perform their job. ""Policing has a piece and responsibility,"" he said. ""But police officers can’t fix school systems. Police officers can’t fix the economy. If you want to reduce crime in Kansas City, St. Louis and Springfield, you have to address those issues too."" Our ruling Greitens said, ""Three of the 11 most violent cities in the U.S. are in Missouri — St. Louis, Kansas City and Springfield."" Greitens is basing his comments on high-quality data, but he uses the data in ways that experts recommend against. Experts dispute the reliability of ranking one city against others based on crime rates. Even the FBI, which compiles the statistics, has a policy against the practice. Greitens’ statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2017/mar/03/eric-greitens/greitens-takes-crime-statistics-out-context/

The fuzzy math of foreign aid and trade
","While the details are vague, foreign aid is on the chopping block in President Donald Trump’s pending budget. Non-military assistance accounts for less than 1 percent of federal spending and defenders of aid would like to argue that it actually pays dividends to America. Shenggen Fan, the head of the International Food Policy Research Institute, a widely respected organization, said his group had a study showing very specific paybacks tied to aid. ""If we help the countries developing to invest in agriculture research, every $1 invested will bring $4 (in) trade with the countries and the United States,"" Fan said Feb. 2 at a meeting in Washington. ""So if you're investing in foreign aid, you’re generating employment back in the U.S. It helps economic growth here in this country."" Fan’s office said he was referring to a 1996 article that described a sort of domino effect. Agricultural research leads to higher production, which in turn delivers economic growth and the extra income generates demand for more imports. ""When the flow of additional imports over time is taken into account, the $1 investment in agricultural research generates $4.39 of additional imports,"" the article said. That seems to back up Fan’s point, but it terms of what it means for sales by American companies, he pushed the findings a little too far. The article specifically noted that there’s no guarantee ""that a particular donor country captures the gains from the increase in exports."" Put another way, an investment of $1 might spur $4 in trade, but there’s no guarantee the original investor will be the one to benefit. Fan posted an item later that dialed back on the trade gains, writing that they would help ""economies like the United States or Germany."" In addition, that study is 20 years old, and we could find no other study that reached the same conclusion. Fan’s office cited a 2006 analysis from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. The center wanted to gauge the economic impact of the work it funded. It did find that research boosted trade, but for a number of reasons, that result didn’t do much to bolster Fan’s case. In the first case, the Australians defined trade gains broadly to include increased sales by Aussie firms to developed countries such as Japan. On top of that, they didn’t find a 4-to-1 payback on trade. When we crunched their numbers, it was more like 1-to-1. The authors also warned that their dollar amounts were based on projected rather than actual benefits. ""It is possible that these benefits never actually emerged or that the benefits that did emerge were considerably greater,"" they wrote. We asked a number of researchers if they knew of any study that linked foreign aid for agricultural research to greater exports for American firms. Not one could think of such work. ""We are not aware of other quantitative estimates of a relationship between investment in agriculture in foreign countries and trade,"" Cheryl Christensen of the USDA’s Economic Research Service told us. The consensus that emerged was that the domino effect Fan had in mind might take place in some countries, but no analysis had pulled all the pieces together. ""I believe that our foreign aid to agriculture is effective and can boost agricultural production and rural income in developing countries,"" Phillip Abbott, professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, told us. ""As countries grow, they may well  -- many do -- need more food than they can produce themselves, and this leads to greater imports, including agriculture imports from U.S. agriculture. Turning this into a causal chain with a fixed multiplier, as claimed by Fan, is a stretch."" Robert Paarlberg at Harvard University’s Kennedy School said plenty of research ties aid to greater productivity and rising incomes. ""But it starts to become difficult when you look for links back to foreign aid, especially agricultural development aid,"" Paarlberg said. ""There the links remain plausible, at least in countries capable of using aid well, but they become too remote to estimate with any confidence."" Our ruling Fan said every dollar of foreign aid for agricultural research ""will bring $4 in trade with the countries and the United States ... generating employment back in the U.S."" A 1996 article supports most of that assertion except for the part about all the trade being with the United States. However, that article is 20 years old and we could find no other study that mirrored its findings. The leading agricultural researchers we reached told us that in some countries, that general result might come about, but it varies from place to place and it is difficult to show the connection to foreign aid in the agricultural research sector. So Fan went too far on three points: the 4-to-1 payback, the amount of trade with the United States and the idea that this general rule applies to most countries when it is actually less predictable.

Are kids in rural Wisconsin crossing 'condemned' bridges to catch their school bus?
","Saying Wisconsin’s transportation needs are urgent, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout, a potential candidate for governor in 2018, made an alarming claim. ""We have bridges in my own county that have been condemned,"" the Alma Democrat said Feb. 24, 2017 on Wisconsin Public Television. ""And we still have school children that are crossing those condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus."" An unsettling image for rural Buffalo County, which is three hours northwest of Madison. We found there are two bridges in the county so badly damaged that they are closed to vehicle traffic, though only one of them is traversed by children to get to and from their school bus. And the word ""condemned,"" while accurate in a colloquial sense, exaggerates the danger to kids. Bridge worries The need for improvements on Wisconsin’s bridges has gained attention in the past couple of years, even if the terms used to describe their condition might mean less than they seem. In October 2015, we rated Mostly True a claim by La Crosse Democrat Jennifer Shilling, the state Senate minority leader, that 71 percent of Wisconsin’s roads were in poor or mediocre condition and 14 percent of its bridges were ""structurally deficient or functionally obsolete."" Structurally deficient means suffering from deterioration to at least one major component, but not unsafe. Functionally obsolete means built using outdated standards, such as older design features. Wisconsin’s figure has risen to 15 percent, according to a 2017 report by the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, with 1,232 bridges deficient and 783 obsolete. How to pay for bridge work has been a persistent issue. A January 2017 audit by the nonpartisan state Legislative Audit Bureau noted that in a 2015 survey done by the bureau, only 50 percent of county highway commissioners said money for routine maintenance on bridges was adequate. Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-majority Legislature, as they work on Walker’s state budget proposal for 2017-’19, are debating about new taxes or other ways of funding road and bridge work. Buffalo County To check Vinehout’s claim, we called Buffalo County Highway Commissioner Bob Platteter. He said flooding caused by an August 2016 storm damaged the 125-foot Schoepps Valley Bridge, which spans Waumandee Creek, beyond repair. ""It’s scrap,"" he said. The bridge was closed to vehicle traffic, so in that sense it could be considered ""condemned,"" Platteter told us -- but it was judged safe for pedestrian crossing, which continued until demolition began nearly seven months later, in March 2017. Nearby residents would drive their children to the bridge and the kids walked over it to catch the school bus, he said. And to avoid a detour of up to 20 miles, some residents with multiple vehicles parked one on the road on one side of the bridge and one on the other side. Platteter said a new timber bridge is expected to be installed by the end of April 2017. The Highway U bridge in Buffalo County partially collapsed one evening in February 2017, causing accidents two accidents that injured both drivers, though neither needed treatment. The collapse likely was also because of flood damage, Platterer said. That bridge is also now open only to pedestrians. But school buses use other county roads to pick up and drop off children in that area, he said. Our rating Vinehout says Wisconsin children are crossing ""condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus."" Two bridges in Vinehout’s home county of Buffalo have been ""condemned"" in that they are too badly damaged for any vehicle traffic. But officials have determined that they remain safe for pedestrians, and children do use one of the bridges to get to and from their school bus.

Rand Paul said repealing 3 regulations saves millions of dollars, thousands of jobs
","With a powerful Republican ally in the White House, Sen. Rand Paul said Congress is moving fast to reduce the burden of government regulations. On ABC’s This Week on Feb. 19, Paul, R-Ky., held up the deregulatory action taken by Congress as an example of the administration’s earliest weeks not being as chaotic as they may have seemed. ""We repealed regulations for the first time in 20 years using the Congressional Review Act,"" Paul added. ""Three regulations that were going to cost the economy hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs."" We decided to review Paul’s claim about whether the moves saved money and jobs. His statement hinges on analyses by the government and industry advocates, but they also occasionally contradict his point. The rules Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can disapprove a rule by a simple majority vote, and then the president must sign off. Trump signed one disapproval on Feb. 14, which rejected a provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. The rule required publicly traded mining, oil and gas companies to disclose their payments to governments. Another, signed Feb. 16, nullified the Stream Protection Rule, a rule created by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (within the Department of the Interior) to limit coal mining companies from releasing waste into waterways. Opponents of the rule said that it would reduce jobs in an already-contracting industry. Proponents said it would help keep ecosystems free of the toxic waste. The third disapproval, which Trump signed on Feb. 28 after Paul’s interview, concerned some provisions of the 2007 National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Intended to stop the mentally ill from obtaining guns, the rule required the Social Security Administration to share information about beneficiaries who do not manage their own benefits to the national background check system. Expected financial toll Paul’s claim that these regulations could cost ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" is reasonable, said Brian Mannix, a research professor at the George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center. He said many federal rules can cost much more than that, though it is difficult to say without a detailed analysis. We found some reports on the effects of the financial and environmental regulations. We did not, however, find a government report assessing costs or job impact for the rule on guns. The SEC estimated that 425 companies might be affected by the new financial disclosure regulation, with average total assets of $6.4 billion. The SEC also set compliance costs for the companies at $54.7 million to upwards of $700 million (the variation is due to variations in fixed costs), though they acknowledged ""significant limitations"" on their analysis that might have made it much lower.    As for the cost of the Stream Protection Rule, the report prepared for the Office of Surface Mining and Enforcement’s estimated total U.S. compliance costs at $81.5 million (or 0.3 percent of estimated total annual revenue for the coal industry). That figure includes $63.6 million for operational costs, which includes commercial transport and reforestation. The government’s potential tax revenue loss to states was $995,000. Paul’s spokesman Sergio Gor sent us a study by Ranboll Environ that was prepared for the National Mining Association, a private group with public opposition to the rule. The study estimates the potential annual value of coal lost to production restriction is between $14 billion and $29 billion, with between $3.1 billion to $6.4 billion lost in state and federal tax revenue. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement declined to comment on the record. Expected jobs impact The question of whether these regulations would save ""tens of thousands"" of jobs is more complex. On the disclosure rule, the SEC report did not comment on potential job increases or losses. And again, there is no estimate for jobs lost as a result of reduced reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. As for the Stream Protection Rule, an impact analysis prepared for the Office of Surface Mining in November 2016 said the rule ""would reduce employment by 124 jobs on average each year due to decreased coal mining,"" though the regulation might add 280 jobs in compliance efforts. The Ramboll Environ report stated that the Stream Protection Rule threatened 113,000 to 280,000 American mining jobs based on what it said was an independent analysis performed at 36 mines across the country. An expert said the government’s estimates are ""much more reasonable"" than the one completed for the mining association. ""My take based on the available research is that the impact of the rule would be minimal,"" said Robert Godby, the director of the University of Wyoming Center for Energy Economics and Public Policy, said about the Stream Protection Rule. He said he thought that the NMA study conflated the potential effects of the Stream Protection Rule with other regulations enacted in 2009, and that the study didn’t account for other market factors that have caused larger downward trends in coal production. Our ruling Paul said that repealing three rules will save ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" and ""tens of thousands of jobs."" Studies of the regulations partially back up Paul’s claim, particularly in terms of financial burden. The evidence is less strong for his point about ""tens of thousands"" of jobs lost. The only information we could find for a regulation with a job-killing aspect is the stream protection rule. The government’s estimate said the rule could result in 124 lost mining positions a year (though compliance could result in the creation of more than twice as many). An industry-backed study offered a much more dramatic outlook for lost coal jobs, but one expert questioned its methodology. We rate this claim Half True. Correction: The Stream Protection Rule came from the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, which is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Interior. An earlier version of this story incorrectly characterized the source of the rule.",/factchecks/2017/mar/02/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-repealing-3-regulations-saved-milli/

Claire McCaskill says she never met with Russian ambassador, past tweets say otherwise
","Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., has called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign over taking meetings with the Russian ambassador without disclosing it to Congress. Sessions, a former Republican senator from Alabama, defended the one-on-one he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak because it was part of his duties as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, not as a surrogate for President Donald Trump’s campaign. In a retort, McCaskill, also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said she never met with Kislyak, who has held his position since 2008. ""I’ve been on the Armed Services Com for 10 years. No call or meeting w/Russian ambassador. Ever. Ambassadors call members of Foreign (Relations Committee),"" she tweeted March 2. I've been on the Armed Services Com for 10 years.No call or meeting w/Russian ambassador. Ever. Ambassadors call members of Foreign Rel Com. But McCaskill’s own earlier tweets show that that’s not the case. She has communicated with the Russian ambassador, at least twice, to discuss policy matters. ""Off to meeting w/Russian Ambassador. Upset about the arbitrary/cruel decision to end all US adoptions, even those in process,"" she tweeted on Jan. 30, 2013. Off to meeting w/Russian Ambassador. Upset about the arbitrary/cruel decision to end all US adoptions,even those in process. The Atlantic has a picture of that very meeting, showing McCaskill (and a few other senators) sitting across the table from Kislyak. And in April 2015, she tweeted: ""Today calls with British, Russian, and German Ambassadors re: Iran deal. #doingmyhomework."" McCaskill spokeswoman Sarah Feldman said McCaskill’s interactions with Kislyak were materially different than Sessions’. Sessions met with Kislyak one-on-one around the same time Russian actors are believed to have been meddling in the election. McCaskill, on the other hand, met him in a group setting to discuss adoption policy and in a brief phone call about the Iran nuclear deal, Feldman said. A few hours after tweeting that she never met with the Russian ambassador, McCaskill published two clarifications, downplaying the significance of the two interactions she had with Kislyak. Again, As senior member of Armed Serv, never received call or request from Russian Amb for meeting. Never met one on one w/him. 4 years ago went to meeting of many Senators about international adoptions. Russian Amb also attended. She also told CNN that Twitter’s 140-character limit prevented her from initially saying she never received a call from the ambassador, as opposed to the call she made to the ambassador about the Iran deal. Sessions had two interactions with Kislyak in 2016. The first was in an informal group setting at a July 2016 event for diplomats at the Republican National Convention. And the second was a private meeting in Sessions’ former Senate office in September. Who initiated the private meeting and what was discussed is so far unknown. In specifying that she never met with Kislyak on Armed Services Committee business, ""McCaskill seems to have inadvertently supported Sessions’ claims,"" said Benjamin Friedman, a research fellow in security studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""She made an unequivocal statement and then had to go back and qualify it by saying she was speaking just about one of her roles and not the other.""

McCaskill’s own tweets show that she has had an in-person group meeting, as well as a phone call, with the Russian ambassador in the past four years. A McCaskill spokesperson contrasted these interactions with the private one-on-one meeting Sessions had in his office with the ambassador.

"['Illinois', 'Susana Mendoza']","
Mendoza correct about state spending on vehicles, but incorrect on Rauner's role
","Facing attacks from the Illinois Republican Party over the purchase of a $32,000 used car amid the state’s dire financial situation, Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza’s office claimed government agencies have spent millions of dollars on vehicles since Gov. Bruce Rauner took office in January 2015. Mendoza’s office issued a statement, stating ""Every state vehicle is paid for with taxpayer funds, including the bigger fleet in which the Governor’s security detail drives him – and all the state agencies controlled by the Governor. The various offices of state government have purchased more than $11 million in vehicles, not counting leases, for use from the Governor on down during the last two years."" Given that Illinois remains embroiled in an unprecedented budget impasse that has caused the unpaid bill backlog to swell to nearly $12 billion, we checked into Mendoza’s claim to verify the $11 million figure. The comptroller’s statement also comes with a not-so-subtle implication that the governor himself authorized the $11 million in vehicle purchases, which we looked into as well. Checking the comptroller’s checkbook  The Chicago-Sun Times first reported Mendoza’s office purchased a used 2016 Ford Explorer with about 16,500 miles from a central Illinois dealership to replace an old vehicle that was ""in need of many expensive repairs before it would be safe to drive,"" according to spokesman Abdon Pallasch.  One of the more notable parts from the comptroller's response was the amount of money state agencies have spent on vehicles during most of the budget stalemate. Jamey Dunn, deputy director of communications for the comptroller’s office, clarified that the last two years referred to in the press release are from January 2015 — when Rauner took office — to February 2017. Mendoza’s statement also notes all state vehicles are paid for with taxpayer dollars, including those purchased by ""all the state agencies controlled by the Governor,"" which suggests the Rauner administration is responsible for all the vehicle spending by the various departments. In response to the comptroller’s statement, Rauner’s director of communications, Brad Hahn, said comparing the comptroller’s small fleet of vehicles to other larger, state agencies is ""completely different."" Mendoza is the keeper of the state’s checkbook and records of expenditures are readily available on the comptroller’s website. We used the comptroller’s Ledger database to search for expenditures on the official category of ""passenger automobiles"" by state agency as well as by month. In fiscal year 2015, state government spent $10.23 million on vehicles, with the Illinois State Police accounting for $6.1 million, or about 60 percent of the total. During the time Rauner was in office that fiscal year — between January and June 2015 — state spending on vehicles was $7.09 million. That includes lapse period spending, which allows state agencies to use the previous year’s spending authority to pay for that year’s bills during the first two months of the current fiscal year. According to the Department of Central Management Services, ISP purchased more than 100 vehicles in FY2015 as part of critical update to its fleet. About half of the total amount spent — $3.05 million — occurred under Rauner. However, Hahn said the governor doesn’t sign off on new cars bought by ISP or other state agencies.   After Rauner took office in the second half of FY 2015, CMS spent more than $2.9 million, which was used to purchase vehicles for the departments of juvenile justice, corrections, human services and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. Expenditures decreased significantly during fiscal year 2016 to $3.19 million. Eighty-six percent of that spending came from the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, which purchased more than $2.3 million in vehicles in February 2016, the same month state procurement records show the agency awarded a contract for 63 light-duty trucks that were to be ""outfitted with a wide array of emergency lighting, radios, arrow and/or message sign boards, lift gates, and other enhancements to meet the Tollway’s requirements."" Spending in the current fiscal year totaled $1.8 million as of March, with the Illinois Department of Transportation purchasing more than $874,000 in vehicles and nearly $528,000 by the Secretary of State’s office. Kelsea Gurski, bureau chief of communication services for IDOT, said the department purchased 56 light-fleet vehicles such as sedans and minivans to update its existing, ""depleted"" fleet, but that the purchases did not increase the size of the fleet.   ""These purchases were part of a much-needed update to our agency’s depleted fleet; many of our older vehicles required repairs that exceeded their value or had rust-related damage that made them unsafe to drive,"" Gurski said. ""IDOT’s light-fleet vehicles are used for transportation for technical staff to worksites, meetings, seminars and training.""

Trump adviser Steve Bannon did not say it’s OK to beat your wife if you love her
","Like a virus, an old fake news story that claims White House adviser Steve Bannon is an advocate of domestic abuse has made the leap from one site full of contrived articles to another. A Nov. 14, 2016, post on USPOLN.com (short for U.S. Political News) starts with a headline that reads, ""Stephen Bannon: ‘Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It’s Out Of Love’."" It was flagged by Facebook as being potentially fake, as part of its crusade to winnow fake news from users’ social media feeds. The story has been popular on Facebook, which notes the USPOLN.com story link has been shared more than 58,000 times in the past four months. The story, which is not real, makes up quotes about Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News who became White House chief strategist for President Donald Trump. The post includes a reference to real charges Bannon faced in 1996, when his then-wife Mary Louise Piccard accused him of domestic abuse. Bannon was charged with misdemeanor domestic violence, battery and dissuading a witness. Those charges were dropped in August 1996 when Piccard did not appear in court. The couple divorced in 1997. The post cites a Politico interview (which is fake), quoting Bannon as saying that marriage is great because ""you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship."" The quote isn’t worded the same way as the headline. ""And just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love,"" Bannon is quoted as saying. ""As a matter of fact, I’ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don’t mean that in everyday life. I’m talking about when they’re performing their marital duties."" Again, Bannon did not say these things. They’re made up. USPOLN.com, which we’ve written about before, identifies itself as ""a US Political News and hybrid News/Satire platform on the web."" The domain is registered to an address in Kosovo. The site didn’t respond to our attempts to contact them via email. But the story actually comes from yet another joke site, in an Aug. 26, 2016, post on Politicops.com. That site is related to the site Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as ""the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web."" The same story also appears on other sites in the Newslo family, like Politicalo.com and Politicot.com. The articles were posted the day after stories recounting Bannon’s 1996 ran in outlets like Politico and the New York Times. Newslo.com stories take a small bite of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. They feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But on other sites without the buttons, there’s no way to know. The Bannon story originated on a site known for generating fake stories.

Lois Kolkhorst says Texas bathroom proposal 'very different' from North Carolina's law
","Opponents of a Texas proposal intended to limit residents to public bathrooms matching the sex on their birth certificate hold out fallout in North Carolina as a warning. After Tar Heel State Republicans reached a bathroom law curbing protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents, economic losses, mostly tied to boycotts, quickly added up to as much as $201 million, PolitiFact North Carolina confirmed in May 2016. Those fact-checkers later found Mostly False a claim that the law hadn’t hurt the economy. Jobs and money were sacrificed, though even hundreds of millions of dollars in losses wouldn’t greatly dent the state’s economy. Texas Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, have pooh-poohed economic arguments against the Texas proposal, Senate Bill 6. Patrick otherwise said in a Jan. 11, 2017, Texas Tribune interview: ""But let's say there is some economic impact. Are we for sale? Are our values for sale? I don't think so."" Patrick and state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, the proposal’s author, maintained at a Feb. 6, 2017, press conference there’s a meaningful difference between what North Carolina adopted and what they seek. Kolkhorst said: ""This bill is very different from the North Carolina bill in that theirs covers a whole list of things that the Texas Privacy Act does not."" A month earlier, though, the Texas Association of Business called SB 6 strikingly similar to North Carolina’s HB 2 law. Both ""ban transgender people from using public school, university and government building restrooms,"" TAB said in a press release, ""and prohibit municipalities from passing transgender-inclusive public accommodations policies."" So, which is it? Kolkhorst’s backup Kolkhorst, asked how she reached her assessment, replied with a statement singling out two elements of North Carolina’s HB 2 missing from SB 6. Specifically, Kolkhorst correctly noted in an email sent by an aide, the Texas proposal has no language affecting worker wages or labor conditions while the North Carolina law does. Also, Kolkhorst said, North Carolina’s law amends the state’s anti-discrimination law to add a bar on discrimination based on a person’s ""biological"" sex; that section confusingly goes on to say that it doesn’t give anyone the right to sue about violations under state law. Kolkhorst told us this change ""prevents local governments from creating a protected class of people other than what the federal law already provides."" SB 6, we confirmed, doesn’t have a similar provision. Nearly identical bathroom provisions On the other hand, the bathroom provisions of the Texas legislation and the North Carolina law struck us as similar, both versions preventing public institutions including schools from letting transgender people enter bathrooms of choice. For instance, North Carolina’s law requires local boards of education to ""require every multiple-occupancy bathroom or changing facility that is designated for student use to be designated for and used only by students based on their biological sex."" Similarly, the Texas legislation directs each school district to adopt a policy ""requiring each multiple-occupancy bathroom or changing facility accessible to students that is located in a school or school facility to be designated for and used only by persons based on the person’s biological sex."" Also, the North Carolina law and the Texas proposal each says schools aren’t restricted from providing, on request ""due to special circumstances,"" an accommodation including a single-occupancy bathroom or changing facility or the ""controlled use"" of a faculty bathroom or changing facility. Equality Texas notes other differences We also asked Equality Texas, a group that says it advocates for ""full equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Texans,"" about Kolkhorst’s claim. By email, spokeswoman DeAnne Cuellar provided a spreadsheet showing a provision-by-provision comparison of the two states’ measure.   Cuellar noted that both measures apply to public agencies and schools. ""The only difference in application is that under SB 6,"" Cuellar wrote, ""a private entity leasing a publicly owned facility (like a stadium) can set its own bathroom and changing room policies while it is occupying the building."" We confirmed that contrast. Kolkhorst’s proposal, unlike HB 2, says a private entity renting a public building isn’t subject to the bathroom limit. The Texas proposal states that a state agency or political subdivision may not ""require or prohibit"" a private entity that leases or contracts to use a building owned or leased by the state or a political subdivision from adopting a policy on the ""designation or use of bathroom or changing facilities"" in the building. Cuellar suggested another notable distinction, saying the North Carolina law broadly nullifies ""LGBT-inclusive municipal nondiscrimination ordinances,"" while SB 6 limits its restriction to local ordinances that allow transgender residents to enter bathrooms of choice. We confirmed North Carolina’s law contains that all-inclusive restriction: ""The General Assembly declares that the regulation of discriminatory practices in places of public accommodation is properly an issue of general, statewide concern,"" the law says, so the bathroom directives and ""other applicable provisions of the General Statutes supersede and preempt any ordinance, regulation, resolution, or policy adopted or imposed by a unit of local government or other political subdivision of the state that regulates or imposes any requirement pertaining to the regulation of discriminatory practices in places of public accommodation."" Kolkhorst’s proposal is explicit by barring political subdivisions from adopting or enforcing a measure relating to a private entity designating a bathroom or changing facility for particular persons--or not. Cuellar further told us that SB 6 -- unlike North Carolina’s law, which lacks enforcement provisions -- sets fines that could be levied for violations of the bathrooms mandate. The Texas legislation, we confirmed, says political subdivisions including school districts that violate the law are liable for a per-day fine of $1,000 to $1,500 for the first violation and $10,000 to $10,500 for the second and subsequent violations. On citizen complaint, the proposal says, the state attorney general may sue for payment. Our ruling Kolkhorst said her proposed Texas Privacy Act ""is very different from"" North Carolina’s law ""in that theirs covers a whole list of things that the Texas Privacy Act does not."" Both the North Carolina law and the Texas bill mandate policies preventing state and local government entities including public schools from letting transgender residents enter bathrooms of choice. But the Texas proposal lacks North Carolina’s section on wages and it doesn’t have North Carolina’s language barring anyone from going to state court to allege discrimination due to the law. Also unlike HB 2, SB 6 doesn’t unplug all local ordinances pertaining to discriminatory practices in public accommodation. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

Trump misleads in claim about terrorism convictions since 9/11
","President Donald Trump, in his first speech before a joint session of Congress, continued to call for improved vetting of people coming to the United States, raising concerns about foreigners convicted on terror charges. ""Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism,"" Trump said Feb. 28. ""According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. … It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur."" Trump’s speech came as his administration said it’s preparing a new executive order on immigration. Courts have halted the implementation of a previous order signed by the president. We wondered about Trump’s claim attributed to the Justice Department. Have the majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 been foreign born? Trump’s statement relies on an analysis put together by a congressional subcommittee then chaired by his now attorney general, Jeff Sessions. The analysis used Justice Department data, but was not issued by the department itself. That data had some limitations. Also, experts told us that most of the people convicted faced charges for threats that were not planned or carried out on U.S. soil. Many of the charges also include nonviolent offenses, such as fraud or immigration violations. Justice Department data A White House spokesperson referred us to a June 2016 Fox News report saying that of 580 individuals convicted for terrorism and terror-related cases, at least 380 were foreign-born. That accounted for convictions from 9/11 to the end of 2014. Trump attributes the Justice Department for providing information on the origin of people convicted on terrorism charges. The information came from research done by the Senate subcommittee on immigration and national interest, led by Sessions, then a U.S. senator representing Alabama. A June 2016 press release said the subcommittee received a list from the Justice Department of 580 individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses between 9/11 and Dec. 31, 2014. But neither the Justice Department nor immigration officials gave the subcommittee information on where the people were born or their immigration status. ""Because the Department of Homeland Security failed to provide us with immigration information on the 580 individuals on the Department of Justice's list, we have attempted to obtain information about the immigration history for each individual using publicly available sources,"" said a June 2016 letter signed by Sessions and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, also a member of the subcommittee. The subcommittee determined that at least 380 of the 580 individuals in the Justice Department list were foreign-born. The list provided by the Justice Department is for convictions based on investigations on international terrorism: It includes acts planned or committed outside U.S. territory but over which federal criminal jurisdiction exists, and those within the United States involving international terrorists and terrorist groups. Domestic terrorism cases with no international links are not included. ""Convictions listed … involve the use of a variety of federal criminal statutes available to prevent, disrupt, and punish international terrorism and related criminal activity,"" the Justice Department letter said. Some may get the impression that the convictions were for terrorist attacks planned or executed in the United States, but that’s the case for only 40 of the 580 convictions, or less than 7 percent, said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert with the libertarian Cato Institute. Furthermore, 241 of those 580 convictions were not for terrorism, but for identity fraud, immigration violations, or other non-terrorism offenses, he said. ""Many of the investigations started based on a terrorism tip like, for instance, the suspect wanting to buy a rocket-propelled grenade launcher,"" Nowrasteh wrote in a post for Cato Institute. ""However, the tip turned out to be groundless and the legal saga ended with only a mundane conviction of receiving stolen cereal. According to Sessions’ list, that cereal thief is a terrorist."" The letter sent by the Justice Department to Sessions’ subcommittee said it included individuals whose conviction emerged from a terrorism investigation, ""regardless of whether investigators developed or identified evidence that they had any connection to international terrorism."" Homegrown terrorism on the rise Security experts said the bigger terrorist threat since 9/11 has come from within the United States. ""Far from being foreign infiltrators, the large majority of jihadist terrorists in the United States have been American citizens or legal residents … every jihadist who conducted a lethal attack inside the United States since 9/11 was a citizen or legal resident,"" a New America study says. ""In addition about a quarter of the extremists are converts, further confirming that the challenge cannot be reduced to one of immigration."" If terrorism includes any act of violence motivated by politics, then you would include both the ideologies of al-Qaida and ISIS, as well as the ideologies of white supremacism, said David Schanzer, director of the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security at Duke University. ""If you look at the phenomenon of terrorism as a whole, then there are a lot of citizens committing terrorism, whether connected with foreign organizations or ideologies or domestic ones,"" Schanzer said. One high-profile example is Dylann Roof, who was not charged for domestic terrorism. Roof, described by authorities as a self-radicalized white supremacist, in 2015 killed nine black parishioners in Charleston, S.C. He was found guilty on 33 federal counts, including hate crimes, but not with terrorism. He has been sentenced to death. Authorities said Roof’s actions were ""consistent with the concept of leaderless resistance and martyrdom advocated by white supremacy extremist groups and self-radicalization leading to violence,"" AP reported. Our ruling Trump said, ""According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country."" Saying the data came from the Justice Department is misleading. It actually came from a congressional subcommittee chaired by then-senator Sessions. Moreover, the data had some limitations. Federal agencies did not provide information on people’s places of origin. Convictions listed also included offenses committed outside the United States and nonviolent acts, such as fraud, experts told us. Finally, the data doesn't account for incidents that some might consider domestic terrorism, such as the case of Dylann Roof.  Trump’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Trump exaggerates economic burden of export tariffs in speech to Congress
","In his address to Congress, President Donald Trump said there’s an uneven playing field when it comes to trade with foreign countries. ""Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes — but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing or almost nothing,"" Trump said Feb. 28. Taxes on imports and exports are important given that Trump has been highly critical of America’s trade policies. Is this United States getting a bad deal when it comes to trade? Experts say Trump is exaggerating. ‘Many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes’ Trump’s generalization that ""many"" countries make us pay ""very high"" tariffs and taxes is misleading. Tariffs are another form of tax that are imposed on many goods as they enter a country. They’re designed to make homegrown products more competitive. The United States has many trade partners, and most tariffs with key trading partners like the European Union, Australia and Canada are relatively low. (In Canada, we pay zero tariffs due to the North American Free Trade Agreement.) However, American exporters trying to access particular markets for certain goods do pay much higher tariffs compared to what the United States charges exporters in those countries. For example, tariffs in developing countries are typically higher. For example, Rwanda’s tariff rate was 13.9 percent in 2012, while the United States rate sat around 2.7 percent, according to data collected by the World Bank. So, in a sense, many other countries make the United States pay higher taxes, but those countries are usually quite small and trade relatively little with the United States. Trump also talked about taxes. Other countries charge their full value added tax on imports, while the United States does not have a VAT and uses a larger corporate income tax. The VAT is collected at each stage in the production or distribution of a product or service, but with a refund mechanism for VAT paid on purchased units so the final burden falls on the final buyer or consumer. For example, when a clothing wholesaler sells some pants to a retailer, the tax is booked on the wholesaler’s mark-up. When the retailer sells the shirt to a customer, the tax is booked again. But the retailer gets a credit back for the tax paid by the wholesaler. ""So our producers do face ‘very high’ taxes in many markets,"" said Gene Grossman, a professor of international economics at Princeton. ""However, the local producers also face these taxes when they sell locally, so the taxes do not disadvantage the United States producers relative to the local producers."" For example, in many circumstances, a VAT administered in the manner that Europe or Japan does so is neutral with respect to trade, he said. So while the United States may incur more financial hurdles in some countries, Trump’s point is overly broad. ‘We charge them nothing or almost nothing’ The United States’ tariff rate is far lower than other countries. But Trump exaggerated when he said the United States charges nothing or almost nothing. On average, tariffs imposed at the border in the United States is 1.5 percent, according to a March 2016 report from the U.S. International Trade Commission. That is below the 2012 world average, which was about 4 percent, according to the World Bank. For a more specific example, you can look to China. For non-agriculture products, the U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods sold in the United States is about 2.9 percent, while Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods sold in China faced a 5 percent tariff. ""Almost nothing is an exaggeration, but not wrong,"" said Joel Trachtman, an international law professor at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Our ruling Trump said, ""When we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes — but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing."" Trump’s claim makes a generalization about the reality of trade in the United States and abroad. There are examples of countries who make the United States pay high tariffs and taxes, but there are other countries who charge about the same or nothing (Canada). It’s really a mixed bag. As for the second part — that we charge them almost nothing — we do charge something, but experts said that something is relatively low on a global setting, so Trump has a point. Overall, we rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2017/mar/02/donald-trump/trump-exaggerates-economic-burden-export-tariffs-s/

Group falsely claims that GOP Sen. Ron Johnson sends 'cease-and-desist' letters to activists
","A website posting on Feb. 28, 2017 spurred a bashing the next day of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, with charges that the Wisconsin Republican was cracking down on free speech. Tweets such as these: Sen Ron Johnson sends constituents a ""cease and desist"" letter so as to not hear their concerns! Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) has sent ""cease and desist"" letters to constituents trying to meet with him.  Sen Ron Johnson orders citizens to ""Cease and Desist"" pleading for #ACA! What we found is that the posting by Citizen Action of Wisconsin -- which claimed that ""people who come to"" the group’s actions ""get a ‘cease and desist’ letter"" from Johnson's office -- is overly broad and misleading. The claim Milwaukee-based Citizen Action describes itself as an ""issue-focused coalition of individuals and organizations committed to achieving social, economic and environmental justice."" The posting it put on its website said:   Dissent is patriotic, that's what we believe. That's why for months we've been showing up to Congressional offices, calling every day, writing letters/emails/postcards & more. And it's why our members took part in town halls and rallies across the state last week during the Congressional Recess, including a 500+ person rally in Greenfield and 150+ in Wausau. Complete with empty chairs for, and a large cardboard cutout of, Senator Ron Johnson.

And what do the people who come to our actions get? A ""cease and desist"" letter (click for full letter) from the Senator's office (signed ""staff""). Senator Johnson is trying his best not to hear our concerns about the future of healthcare, about the future of our country and the fate our of families. The post ends with a reference to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and the chance to sign an online petition saying ""we will not cease and desist."" By the morning of March 2, 2017, the count was more than 2,800 signatures. Citizen Action included with its post a link to a photograph of a Feb. 27, 2017 letter on Johnson’s official Senate stationery. The name of the recipient of the letter is blacked out, but we confirmed that the letter was sent to Earl Good, a 72-year-old Milwaukee retiree. The letter The Johnson letter to Good, which is signed by ""Staff,"" says: This Cease and Desist letter is to inform you that any further communication from you to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson’s office can only be done in writing. This means that you are not to call or visit any of Senator Johnson’s staff or any of his offices at any time.  Our office has done all that we can to assist you with your concerns. This letter acts as a written notice of our expectation for you to discontinue your unwanted telephone calls and office visits.  If you fail to comply with this notice, then we will have no other alternative but to contact the United States Capitol Police and report your noncompliance. Perspectives Good told the Journal Sentinel that since the November 2016 elections, he has been calling Johnson's office on various issues and has joined others who visit Johnson's Milwaukee office to raise concerns about issues such as health care. He said that in mid-February, he called Johnson's office 40 times on one day and 83 times another day. He said he kept calling until someone answered the phone rather than letting his call go to voicemail. He said he is persistent but has always been polite when interacting with Johnson's staff on the phone or in person. Kevin Kane, the organizing director for Citizen Action, told us Good has been involved in recent months in the group’s initiatives, including visits to Johnson’s office in an effort to preserve the Affordable Care Act. Kane said he has observed Good as being persistent but respectful. But Kane said he was not familiar with all of Good’s interactions with Johnson’s staff and that Good is the only person involved with Citizen Action that is known to have received a cease-and-desist letter from Johnson. Finally, here’s what Johnson staff members Patrick McIlheran and Ben Voelkel told us (they would not identify Good as the recipient of the letter, but confirmed the letter is legitimate): The letter was sent to Good because of repeated behavior over the previous two months, in person, that was harassing and threatening to Johnson's staff, not because of any dissent voiced by the resident about politics or policy. They would not provide more details.

Johnson's staff believed the man was acting on his own and the staff was not aware of whether he was involved with Citizen Action or any other group.

The behavior led Johnson's office to contact the Capitol Police, which suggested that the letter be sent.

Johnson's office has sent four or five cease-and-desist letters since Johnson took office in January 2011, and this was the first since the November 2016 elections. Our rating Citizen Action says ""people who come to"" their dissent actions ""get a ‘cease and desist’ letter"" from Johnson's office. Despite the broadness of the claim, the group produced a cease-and-desist letter written to only one person who it says has been involved in Citizen Action initiatives such as preserving the Affordable Care Act. The letter demands that the man stop visiting or calling any of Johnson’s staff or offices, but says written communications will be received. And Johnson’s staff says it issued the letter, on the advice of the U.S. Capitol Police, because the man had been harassing and threatening to staff, not because he protested any of Johnson’s actions. We rate the statement False. Editor's note: Four days after this fact check was published, Citizen Action posted an apology about its claim against Johnson.",/factchecks/2017/mar/02/citizen-action-wisconsin/group-falsely-claims-gop-sen-ron-johnson-sends-cea/

'Obama tax hikes'? Just as easily call them the Bush tax hikes.
","
Sarah Palin has been traveling the country this week promoting her new book, America by Heart, and her new reality television show, Sarah Palin's Alaska. But she's still taking time to comment through her Twitter account on national tax policy.

""Pls refer to Jan.1 tax changes appropriately: they're OBAMA TAX HIKES & they'll slam every American's savings, investments & job opportunity,"" Palin wrote on Dec. 1.

We'll give Palin credit for cramming a ton of tax policy into the 140 character-limit on the Twitter messaging service. But is her statement accurate?

To answer this question, we need to deconstruct the tweet almost word by word.

We'll start with the ""Jan.1 tax changes."" As of today, the law, which was backed by President George W. Bush, states that the nation's current tax rates will expire on Jan. 1, 2011, and revert back to the rates in place prior to 2001.

Tax rates differ depending on your income. But here's how the tax brackets would look on a before-and-after basis for married couples filing jointly based on their incomes. For simplicity, we're ignoring modest adjustments for inflation. Tax brackets for other categories such as individual filers broadly follow the same pattern.

  • Up to $16,750: Rate rises from 10 percent to 15 percent
  • From $16,751 to $58,200: Stays same at 15 percent, but entire bracket pays 5 percent additional on the first $16,750
  • From $58,201 to $68,000: Rises from 15 percent to 28 percent
  • From $68,001 to $137,300: Rises from 25 percent to 28 percent
  • From $137,301 to $209,250: Rises from 28 percent to 31 percent
  • From $209,251 to $373,650: Rises from 33 percent to 36 percent
  • $373,651 and up: Rises from 35 percent to 39.6 percent

We have noticed that Palin and some other Republicans talk as if Obama and the Democrats want to see tax rates go up for all incomes. That's not the case.

President Barack Obama campaigned on a promise to keep the same tax rates for couples making less than $250,000 and individuals making less than $200,000. He has consistently maintained that position, as do most Democrats. Republicans, on the other hand, want the current tax rates to stay in place for everyone. Will Obama and Congress be able to reach an agreement? They're negotiating as we report this, so that's a question we can't answer.

The tax rates are expiring on Jan. 1, 2011, because of the way they were created in the first place. Back in 2001 and again in 2003, Republicans used a process known as reconciliation that only requires 50 votes to pass the Bush tax cuts. (You might remember that Democrats used reconciliation to pass part of the health care bill earlier this year.)

But there are a number of rules that govern reconciliation, and one of those rules says that you can't include things that affect the budget for more than 10 years. That's why the tax cuts are expiring. Republicans didn't have the 60 votes they needed in the Senate to make the tax cuts permanent. 
We should point out that the 2001 reconciliation bill passed in the Senate with some Democratic support, 58-33. In 2003, the vote was closer, 50-50, with then vice president Dick Cheney breaking the tie. 
""Republicans very deliberately engineered this set of tax cuts to expire after 10 years,"" said Norman Ornstein, a long-time observer of Congress and politics and a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""They did it for utterly political reasons."" Palin's statement is ""a vast stretch of the truth,"" he said.

The ten-year limit also masked the effects that the new tax rates would have on the deficit in later years, he said. Both parties now want to continue most of the tax rates that will significantly increase the deficit, even as they say they want to fix the budget picture. ""This is one area where neither party can be proud,"" he added. ""Nobody is standing entirely on principle.""

Palin calls the tax changes ""OBAMA TAX HIKES & they'll slam every American's savings, investments & job opportunity."" If she's talking about all the tax cuts expiring, though, you would also have to give some blame to the people who passed the temporary tax cuts in the first place: President George W. Bush and previous Congresses. And they certainly wouldn't belong to Obama alone, since it would take a gridlocked Congress to fail to produce any legislation.

But there's an alternate reading. Let's say Palin is only talking about Obama's stated plan, which is tax increases for the wealthy. Then she would be more accurate. Here's what Daniel Mitchell, an economist and senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, said when we asked him about it:

""Obama wants the higher tax rates to happen, so I definitely think it's fair to link him to the policy (though I also thinks it's fair for people to castigate Bush for adopting tax cuts with expiration dates),"" Mitchell said. ""The accuracy of the 'every American' accusation depends on how narrowly you want to measure impact. A narrow look, which counts only direct effects, would lead one to say that the 'rich' are the ones getting penalized. Economists, however, look at indirect effects such as the impact on investment and job creation. And that's why lower and middle income Americans would be adversely affected. I'm an economist, so I think her statements (on this issue) are accurate.""

In September, the conservative Heritage Foundation released a paper titled ""Obama Tax Hikes: The Economic and Fiscal Effects,"" that made a similar case that tax increases on higher incomes will affect economic growth and thus hurt all taxpayers.

Left-leaning analysts see it differently, though.

""I think there's a great irony here,"" said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""All the focus is on the Bush tax cuts, but Obama cut taxes, too. And they don't really talk about that, but the Republicans want to stop it.""

Marr is talking about tax cuts included in the economic stimulus act. The tax cuts were implemented right away and the Internal Revenue Service issued new withholding tables, so people saw small increases in their regular paychecks. The problem is that the increases were small enough that a lot of people didn't notice them. A New York Times/CBS News Poll in September showed that fewer than one in 10 people knew that the Obama administration had lowered taxes for American workers.

The Obama tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and like the income tax rates, it's not clear whether Congress will act to extend them.

""It's very strange because you have this populist anger over taxes, and the working class is probably going to have to pay higher taxes next year,"" Marr added.

We then turned to Bob Williams, an economist with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. He said he didn't think it was accurate to call tax increases ""Obama's tax hikes,"" because Obama has proposed extending the current rates for the vast majority of tax payers. He said assigning blame for the expiration of the tax increases is probably less useful than deciding what tax policy should be in the future.

""What really matters is where you end up,"" he said.

Getting back to our ruling statement, Palin said that ""Pls refer to Jan.1 tax changes appropriately: they're OBAMA TAX HIKES & they'll slam every American's savings, investments & job opportunity."" This pretty clearly makes it sound like Obama wants to raise taxes on everyone, which is not the case. Also, if you want to give Obama the blame, you'd also have to give a good portion of blame to the current Congress. It's been well-known that the tax cuts are going to expire, and there was nothing stopping the Democratic-controlled Congress from addressing the issue earlier. Finally, you'd also have to give some blame to Bush and the previous Congresses for passing tax cuts that expire. So we don't think Palin's statement is accurate and we rate it False.",/factchecks/2010/dec/02/sarah-palin/obama-tax-hikes-just-easily-call-them-bush-tax-hik/

Bob McDonnell says Virginia college tuitions have doubled in 10 years
","
In a recent ""Ask the Governor"" session on WTOP radio, host Mark Segraves told Gov. Bob McDonnell that a Virginia Tech student had called to complain about the rising cost of tuition.

""And he should,"" McDonnell responded. ""I have a daughter at Virginia Tech and two (sons) at U.Va. right now and I’m saying I understand his pain. The tuitions in Virginia colleges, Mark, have doubled -- 100 percent -- in the last 10 years. It’s unacceptable.""

We won’t challenge the governor on where his children are enrolled, but we did wonder whether tuition at all state schools had doubled.

McDonnell Press Secretary Stacey Johnson supported the claim with a July State Council of Higher Education for Virginia report. She pointed to a chart showing the average full-time in-state undergraduate tuition with mandatory teaching-related fees has risen from $2,192 in 2000-01 to $5,670 for 2010-11 -- significantly more than double.

But we wondered if each public college and university had doubled its tuition over the decade.

So, we turn back to the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia’s report, which clearly shows that tuition and fees are on the rise.  

For 2010-11, all of the state’s 16 public schools show undergraduate tuition and mandatory teaching-related fees increasing by at least 5 percent from the previous year. Half of those increases are in the double digits, with Virginia Commonwealth University at the top of the list with a 23.9 percent hike from 2009-10. Old Dominion University had the smallest increase at 5.3 percent.  

Now, we need to see how things looked a decade ago.

According to a 2000-01 State Council of Higher Education report, McDonnell’s claim still holds up if we look at all the state’s public four-year institutions.  

Only Richard Bland College -- a two-year junior college -- has not doubled its tuition, and even that school is only $256 shy of the mark.

The only way McDonnell’s claim runs into trouble is if we look at tuition and all mandatory fees -- for non-instructional uses such as athletics and capital debt service. Even then, only two schools -- James Madison University and Old Dominion University -- have yet to double the 2000-01 figures, and both are short by less than $200.

In case you’re curious, the average tuition including all mandatory fees and room and board for four-year state schools has risen from $8,813 in 2000-01 to $16,833 this year -- nearly double.  

Also of note: Tuition spiked sharply in fiscal 2002 after a tuition freeze instituted in fiscal 1997 was lifted. A mandatory tuition reduction was also implemented in fiscal 2000.   

""The freeze was lifted in Fiscal Year ‘02 because of budget cuts to higher education. That's when tuition and E&G  (instructional) fees shot up by an average of 21.5 percent across the public institutions,"" said Kirsten Nelson with the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia.

More recent spikes were also caused by budget cuts.

""The reasons they have gone up fairly substantially in the past couple years is because they’ve suffered budget cuts from the General Assembly,"" Nelson said. ""One of the reasons that higher education gets cut is because the institutions have an alternate source of income, which is tuition.""

Nelson said things could have been worse were it not for the almost $275 million state colleges and universities received from the 2009 Stimulus Act.

Now, let’s review:

McDonnell’s claim that Virginia tuition has doubled in the last 10 years is 100 percent true using the average. If we look individually at each of the state’s four-year schools, it’s still true.

Only if we include Richard Bland, the state’s only two-year junior college, is it not entirely true to say that all state colleges and universities have doubled tuition, but even then it’s off just a tad.

So we find the claim to be True.    ",/factchecks/2010/dec/02/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-says-virginia-college-tuitions-have-/

U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore says domestic violence deaths in Wisconsin are at their highest in 10 years
","
When U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) was honored by the National Network to End Domestic Violence, she issued a statement saying ""we have a real crisis on our hands.""

In Wisconsin, her Oct. 7, 2010, statement read, ""deaths from domestic violence are at the highest in 10 years.""

Indeed, eight days earlier, the Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence released a report that made that claim.

According to her spokesman, Moore based her statement on a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article about the report. The article said domestic violence ""claimed 67 lives"" in 2009.

We wondered: Does that mean domestic abusers killed 67 people? And is that number, as Moore claimed, a 10-year high?

The Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence, like the national organization that honored Moore, is an advocacy group committed to ending domestic violence. It has produced a ""domestic violence homicide report"" each year since 2000, using data from crime report summaries from local police agencies and from various news articles.

The coalition defines homicide as ""the killing of one human being by another.""

But its annual homicide reports actually count more than that.

As in previous years, the 67 deaths in the 2009 report included homicides in commonly understood domestic violence cases -- such as when the victims and perpetrators were spouses or partners, former spouses or partners, or adults with children in common.

Homicides of other people are counted if, for example, a woman’s current boyfriend kills the woman’s former boyfriend; if a third person trying to protect a domestic violence victim kills the perpetrator; or if the domestic violence victim kills the perpetrator in self-defense.

But the Wisconsin coalition -- as it clearly notes in its report -- also adds suicides committed by domestic violence perpetrators. For example, it counts the January 2009 death of a Fond du Lac County man who took his own life after shooting his wife to death outside their home.

All told, the coalition says that in 2009, ""there were 47 domestic violence homicide incidents resulting in 67 deaths -- 52 homicides and 15 perpetrator suicides.""

Many people would not consider a domestic violence perpetrator who committed suicide to be a domestic violence victim. The coalition says it has always included perpetrator suicides in its annual tallies because they occurred as a result of a domestic violence incident, said spokesman Tony Gibart.

By the coalition’s count, the 67 total deaths in 2009 was the highest in 10 years, exceeding the previous high of 61 in 2003.

Excluding the suicides, the 52 other domestic violence homicides also were the highest in 10 years, exceeding the previous high of 45 in 2003.   

So, Moore accurately quoted the group’s statistics, and those statistics have been consistently handled -- even though including the suicides increases the number.

We checked a few other states for how they tally domestic violence deaths: 
  
  
""There’s no national standard way of reporting"" domestic violence deaths, but counting perpetrator suicides is not common, said Shellene Johnson, the Minnesota coalition’s program manager.

We also asked a state agency, the Wisconsin Office of Justice Assistance, if there are official statistics on domestic violence deaths.

The answer is, not exactly.

Homicides tracked by the office are not identified in terms of whether they were the result of domestic violence, and suicides are not tracked at all. The office can infer which homicides were domestic, based on the relationship between the offender and the victim as recorded in police reports, said spokeswoman Tami Jackson. But unlike the Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the office does not look more closely into the circumstances of the deaths, she said.

That brings us back to Moore’s claim.

The Milwaukee congresswoman said deaths in Wisconsin from domestic violence ""are at the highest in 10 years.""  Moore accurately quoted statistics compiled by an advocacy group for 2009. It’s important to note the group includes suicides committed by domestic violence perpetrators, which makes the death tally higher than it would otherwise be. Even so, either way you track it, the 2009 numbers were at a 10-year high. We rate Moore’s statement True.",/factchecks/2010/dec/02/gwen-moore/us-rep-gwen-moore-says-domestic-violence-deaths-wi/

Republicans get early jump on 2012 campaign season with attack on Sen. Sherrod Brown
","
You can always tell when one election cycle ends and another begins. The punches don’t stop, but the names of those being attacked change.

So the 2012 election cycle is upon us already, and U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown is up for re-election to another six-year term. Brown, an Ohio Democrat, does not have a Republican opponent yet, but it’s early. Not wasting time, however, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, or NRSC, used a congressional vote by Brown on Nov. 29 to criticize him for what it called his ""out of touch"" and ""extreme partisan"" agenda.

Brown, the NRSC said in a news release,  voted to keep ""an extreme, job-killing Internal Revenue Service paperwork mandate.""

The attack was no surprise. Republicans would love to defeat Brown. But we wondered whether this particular attack was fair.

The vote was on an amendment to kill an unpopular paperwork-filing requirement for small businesses. Because of a provision in this year’s health-care law, businesses will have to report to the IRS all purchases exceeding $600 that they make to a single vendor.  The requirement, which kicks in in 2012, was seen by its original sponsors as a way to boost federal revenue and help pay for the health-care overhaul by making sure that businesses that sell to other businesses report all their income and pay taxes on it.

But in order to make sure the sellers pay their taxes, the provision puts a new onus on the buyers to report their transactions, whether a landscaping service is paying for lawn mowers or gasoline or an advertising agency is paying freelance artists. Small businesses say this will create a paperwork nightmare, especially for solo operators and mom-and-pop businesses that buy supplies in small batches. Many members of Congress agree.

Yet two votes to kill it failed on Nov. 29.

One was on an amendment by Sen. Mike Johanns, a Nebraska Republican who attached it to an unrelated food safety bill. Johanns’ measure would have repealed the controversial paperwork provision while directing the White House to recapture the lost tax revenue by taking back unspent money in various federal programs. The Office of Management and Budget would make those decisions. Every Senate Republican and 21 Democrats voted for the amendment, which failed to get the two-thirds majority needed for passage.

Brown and 34 other Democrats voted against it,

Brown’s objection was two-fold, according to discussions we had with him and his communications director. He said that decisions on program cuts should be made by Congress, not the executive branch. And he said that the cuts could have been too extensive, since the Johanns measure called for revoking ""all available unobligated funds,"" specified in his amedment at $39 billion. That could include money approved by Congress but not yet spent for disaster relief, cyber-security investments and public housing rental assistance, according to a Senate Appropriations Committee list of unspent federal money.

So Brown voted no. And Republicans slammed him in their press release.

""Thanks to Sherrod Brown's out-of-touch Washington agenda, Ohio's small businesses will have to spend their time and money filling out mountains of government paperwork rather than doing business and creating jobs,"" NRSC Press Secretary Amber Marchand said in the release. ""With Ohio's families suffering from high unemployment, Brown once again chose to put his extreme partisan agenda ahead of the best interests of his state, and that's why he will face an uphill battle in 2012.""

Never mind the over-the-top rhetoric, which is typical in political criticism regardless of which party makes it. There’s a more basic problem with the attack on Brown on the small business paperwork provision.

About 22 minutes after voting no, Brown voted yes on a different amendment to do the same thing: kill the paperwork requirement. This amendment, sponsored by Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, had 42 Democratic votes and two Republican votes in favor.

But unlike the Johanns amendment, this one did not specify how the government would recoup lost tax revenue if the paperwork provision -- and the taxes it could bring in -- went away.

It is fair to debate which of these amendments was better, and whether there should be spending offsets. Johanns said that the Baucus amendment would add $19 billion to the federal deficit.

But that’s a broader economic debate. Democrats including President Barack Obama say they have heard the complaints about the paperwork provision and are pretty sure they’ll deal with it before it kicks in. You don’t have to agree with them, or to like Brown’s position or the Baucus amendment. But by saying Brown ""voted in favor of an extreme, job-killing paperwork mandate,"" the NRSC exaggerates that single vote, distorts its context and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

One more critical fact: Brown separately co-sponsored the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act, another potential bill by Baccus to get rid of the paperwork requirement, on Nov. 18, 11 days before the vote on which he was slammed.

We’d rule the NRSC’s claim False but for the fact that Brown did cast a ""no"" vote on the Johanns amendment. But with so much context missing, the Truth-o-Meter’s arrow stays in the low range: Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/dec/02/national-republican-senatorial-committee/republicans-get-early-jump-2012-campaign-season-at/

Food safety law to regulate your backyard garden? No, it doesn't.
","
We've received several e-mails from readers asking us about new food safety legislation pending in Congress. They wanted to know if it is true that the bill would regulate backyard gardening.

They sent us several claims promoted by various bloggers. Here's how a website called NaturalNews put it 
""Senate Bill 510, the Food Safety Modernization Act, has been called 'the most dangerous bill in the history of the United States of America.' It would grant the U.S. government new authority over the public's right to grow, trade and transport any foods. This would give Big Brother the power to regulate the tomato plants in your backyard. ... This tyrannical law puts all food production (yes, even food produced in your own garden) under the authority of the Department of Homeland Security. Yep -- the very same people running the TSA and its naked body scanner / passenger groping programs."" 
This kind of statement takes a real concern about the bill -- that it might impose excessive regulation on small farmers -- and blows it up into a fabrication.

First, a bit about the legislation: Congress decided to act after several notable cases of people being sickened by contaminated foods, such as eggs that were subject to a major recall earlier this year. One out of four Americans are sickened by tainted food each year and 5,000 die, according to the National Center for Infectious Diseases. The bill gives the Food and Drug Administration -- not the Department of Homeland Security -- expanded powers to inspect facilities and trace food-borne illness. (The Department of Homeland Security is mentioned in the bill in respect to regulating food imported from overseas and in preventing intentional poisoning of the food supply.) It also allows the FDA to impose mandatory recalls after illness outbreaks, instead of asking companies to comply voluntarily.

Consumer advocates said the bill was a common-sense step forward. Others expressed concern that the law was too broad: it asks the Secretary for Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, to develop specific regulations about how the increased inspections would work.

Peter Van Doren of the Cato Institute reviewed a similar bill passed by the House of Representatives last year, and said he was concerned that the language in the House bill was overly broad. ""The question of how much or little is encompassed by this language seems open to differing interpretations and would be the subject of much jockeying when the actual regulations implementing the law were written,"" he said.

The Senate took up the issue more recently, and, to allay concerns about small growers, Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., offered an amendment exempting most local food providers and small farmers from new federal regulations as long as the growers complied with local rules and their produce was not connected to active outbreaks of illness.

The Senate accepted the amendment and approved the overall bill 73 to 25 on Tuesday. The House must now approve it, either outright or through conference committee, and the President must sign it before it becomes law.

So will Big Brother be trailing around behind you in his Wellingtons next spring as you set out your seedlings?

We reviewed the Senate version of the bill carefully and read ongoing news coverage of the food safety law. Nowhere could we find mention of backyard gardens being included. In fact, the Senate version, even prior to Tester's amendment, said regulations must be developed that prioritize food facilities that pose the highest risk to public safety. That would imply that not all facilities would receive the same level of scrutiny.

Additionally, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the bill makes no mention of widespread inspections in its cost estimates. ""Based on the inspection schedule specified, CBO estimates that this bill would require about 50,000 domestic and foreign food facilities to be inspected in 2015,"" said a CBO report. Meanwhile, the National Gardening Association estimates that 36 million households participated in food gardening in 2008.

Finally, we checked in with a few groups that followed the legislation's development closely. We interviewed Scott Openshaw, director of communications for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents major food companies and tracked the legislation closely. He said the pending legislation will not apply to home gardeners.

""Backyard gardens will NOT be affected in any, way, shape or form by the food safety bill. Zero, zilch, zip, nada,"" Openshaw told us via e-mail. 
Another person who followed the bill closely was David Plunkett, a senior staff attorney for food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest; he too said that backyard gardens were not part of the bill. Plunkett pointed us to a line in Section 105 the Senate bill that said the rules ""shall not apply to produce that is produced by an individual for personal consumption.""

In rating this statement, we see no evidence to support the claim that backyard gardens would be regulated under the food safety bill. There might be legitimate concerns about small growers, but even those have been addressed in the Senate version of the bill. At any rate, concerns about small growers are quite different then the claim that backyard gardens will be regulated. We find no evidence to support the claim and rate it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/dec/01/blog-posting/food-safety-law-regulate-your-backyard-garden-no-i/

Bill Nelson talks one way on earmarks, but votes another
","
Florida's U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson joined 32 Republicans and six other Democrats on Nov. 30, 2010, in unsuccessfully pushing for a moratorium on earmarks for the next three federal budget years.

But that's not the position Nelson staked out just two weeks prior.

Speaking to reporters on Nov. 15, 2010, after meeting with Florida U.S. Sen.-elect Marco Rubio, Nelson said earmarks were an important part of creating jobs and growing Florida's economy. (Rubio supports a moratorium on federal earmarks).

Nelson said he gave Rubio ""the example of bringing a nuclear aircraft carrier to Mayport (and) the necessary earmarks that take place over five years. It's a request by the Department of Defense, but if I didn't attend to that appropriation, the Virginia delegation was going to eliminate a carrier going into Florida.""

Nelson then talked about ports in Miami and Jacksonville needing millions of dollars to deepen their channels so that ships using the Panama Canal could dock there -- and how getting an earmark to pay for the work is critical.

""That is huge to Florida -- to trade, to jobs, to economic activity, that all of those big cargo ships coming through the Panama Canal come to Florida instead of going to Savannah and to Charleston,"" Nelson said. ""Those are the hard realities when we talk about the appropriations we call earmarks. So if you tie them to jobs in your local economy, that seems like that's a defining way.""

Yet on Nov. 30, 2010, he was one of 39 senators to support waiving Senate rules to consider an earmark moratorium for fiscal years 2011, 2012 and 2013. The measure failed 56-39.

That Nov. 30 vote also stands in contrast to a vote Nelson cast eight months earlier, according to Senate records. On March 16, 2010, Nelson was one of 68 senators to table a motion to ban earmarks for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. The motion was tabled by a vote of 68-29.

Asked about the switch in positions by the St. Petersburg Times' Alex Leary, Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin said: ""These are unusual (economic) times. ... Going forward Sen. Nelson will keep looking for ways to cut spending, while also fighting to make sure Florida gets its fair share of federal funding for things like ports, military bases and major projects that bring new jobs.""

Without a formal ban, Nelson -- who is up for reelection in 2012 -- is free to continue to pursue earmarks. But his Nov. 30 vote is an about-face from an earlier vote and his comments to reporters. So it's an easy call for our Flip-O-Meter. We say Full Flop.",/factchecks/2010/dec/01/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-talks-one-way-earmarks-votes-another/
"['Federal Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Dave Obey']","
U.S. Rep. Dave Obey says an earmarks ban would greatly weaken Congressional authority, ceding it to the executive branch
","
On Nov. 29, 2010, the U.S. Senate chamber rang with allegations that members were about to yield precious power to President Barack Obama and render themselves impotent when it comes to controlling spending.

At issue was a proposed two-year moratorium on earmarks, those much-maligned special projects inserted by individual congressmen and associated with pork-barrel politics.

The Senate ultimately voted down the ban, with opponents coming from both sides of the aisle -- though it could return once new members are sworn in come January. In the House, Republicans have voted in their caucus for a broad earmarks ban, but Democrats have not joined the move.

The claim that a ban would save nothing has been thoroughly tested (PolitiFact National found that statement Mostly True). Receiving much less attention: The argument that a ban would greatly shift power to the executive branch.

U.S. Rep. Dave Obey (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, says a ban would do just that.

In a strongly worded statement, Obey suggested Republicans in Congress would be ""turning total control over spending to the administration"" by banning earmarks. He also suggested Republicans under the Tea Party philosophy were messing with powers that are ""a large part of this institution’s constitutional authority.""

Obey, who is retiring from the House in January, spoke out after his replacement, Republican Sean Duffy, was picked to make the motion in the House Republican caucus to ban earmarks in the next Congress.

So are Obey and other members on target in suggesting that an earmark ban could seriously affect the balance of power?

First let’s look review some constitutional basics.

Congress -- the legislative branch -- has ""power of the purse"" by virtue of Article 1 of the Constitution, which declares in part that ""No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.""

But the president -- leader of the executive branch -- first proposes the budget.

That sets up a fundamental tug-of-war between the branches. Congress passes massive appropriations bills to fund the budget, and also uses very specific earmarks and other procedures to direct that budgeted funds be spent on a particular project or program, or be directed to specific contractors. Earmarks can bypass competitive processes.

Insiders, outsiders and scholars are all over the map on the congressional powers question.

Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group that backed the earmark moratoriums, said Obey’s contention was ""not accurate.""

Not only does Congress have the lead role in appropriations, it has the ability to do much more to hold the executive branch accountable than it does now, Ellis said.

He argues Congress has relied narrowly on the relatively small-ticket earmarking process to the detriment of its oversight into broader spending issues. Members could force better bidding procedures, for instance, so the administration is held more accountable.

""Earmarks are a lazy way of deciding where the funding goes,"" Ellis said. ""Congress became fat,  dumb and happy.""

Scott Lilly disagrees.

He had a front-row seat to the spending game as a top Obey aide for more than a decade and later as director of the House Appropriations Committee staff. Now he’s a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank.

Lilly thinks Obey is on point because constitutional authority alone has not assured that Congress actually controls appropriations as intended.

Of an earmarks ban, Lilly said: ""I don't think it is a complete capitulation, but it is certainly allowing your opponent to tie one arm behind your back.""

Lilly, echoing many scholars, thinks Congress has lost big ground to the executive branch, in part due to partisanship that has seeped into the appropriations process. Threats of filibusters have become common in recent years, he noted. A recent example: Congress has not passed a budget or any appropriations bills for the 2011 fiscal year, which began in October.

Lilly said earmarks are often parochial but sometimes have serious and broad policy purposes. He cited an example of a powerful members earmarking funds for more vehicle armor in war zones.

If an administration disregards congressional directives or spends funds for purposes not requested in its budget or fails to address an important issue, earmarks can prove a corrective, said Lilly, who supports limits but not a ban on earmarks.

A conservative in the Senate, Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) agrees with the Obey-Lilly camp. Inhofe argued on the Senate floor that earmarks is such a loose term that virtually all congressional appropriation authority could be compromised by a ban.

""It would be nothing short of criminal to go through all the trouble of electing great, new anti-establishment conservatives, only to be politically correct and have them cede to Obama their constitutional power of the purse,"" Inhofe said.

Inhofe, though, is in a minority in his party, which is under Tea Party pressure to reform on spending -- even if it means giving up power to a Democratic president.

Obey himself cited several examples in his remarks for the Journal Sentinel:

""Does (an earmark ban) mean that the administration’s request for military family housing or Army Corps of Engineers projects is to be considered the final word on the subject? Shouldn’t Congress be able to alter that list to avoid waste or focus scarce resources to the highest priorities? Does that mean that if there is a disaster, like the shooting at Fort Hood, Congress shouldn’t have the power to address it?""

So that’s the practical insiders’ take: In the real world, an earmarks ban would limit congressional power but not necessarily snuff it out -- the power comes from the Constitution, so if someone chooses not to use it, it is not eliminated.

A prominent scholar on separation of powers agrees to some extent on the limiting effect of a ban.

University of Virginia law professor John C. Harrison preaches caution on using a ""blunderbuss"" approach to banning earmarks. A broad ban could indeed significantly restrict important congressional discretion, he said.

Congress should restrict earmarks to eliminate pointless pork-barrel spending, but without limiting its powers to make specific appropriations where appropriate, Harrison said.

Another outsider, from the right, views the constitutional argument as a red herring.

Tad DeHaven, budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, was skeptical about the suggestion that an earmark ban would have a major effect on checks and balances at the Capitol.

He said Congress had already abdicated authority by setting up many bureaucracies to oversee spending: ""These guys are hiding behind the constitution as a matter of convenience.""

And that conveniently brings us to our assessment.

In the end, the debate over congressional spending authority operates on two levels -- on paper, and in practice. Obey and others overreach by suggesting Congress would be bereft of spending oversight under an earmarks moratorium. The legislative branch would still have power but might have to find new ways to exercise it on occasion.

But critics of a ban correctly point out that earmarks have been not only for local congressional projects but important tools used on larger policy questions. As they note, congressional authority has slipped -- and a blanket approach to banning earmarks could further tip the scales to the administration.

DeKalb commissioner says low-flow toilets can be costly
","
Thanks to The Dunwoody Crier, the minds of your AJC PolitiFact Georgia scribes are in the toilet.

An op-ed by DeKalb County Commissioner Elaine Boyer derided what she called ""the toilet tax,"" which was passed in response to the region's drought.

""Two years ago, the commission unnecessarily started mandating that low-flush toilets had to be installed in older homes for sales to get to the closing table,"" Boyer wrote in the Oct. 27 issue. ""Those toilets can cost homeowners up to $1,000 each.""

Toilets? For $1,000?

We were, ahem, bowled over. Does a commode really cost that much? We researched the ordinance and called plumbers to find out.

A 2008 DeKalb ordinance requires that newly purchased buildings have low-flow toilets and other water-saving fixtures installed before the county turns on water service. The ordinance applies to residential and commercial properties built before Jan. 1, 1993, in the county's unincorporated areas.

The Department of Watershed Management performs free inspections to certify a building is compliant.

Buildings that will be torn down, foreclosed, or transferred between spouses or from a parent to a child are exempt.

If the switch costs more than $1,000 per toilet for a residential property, you can get a financial hardship waiver.

DeKalb County offers a rebate program to defray the cost. Water customers can purchase from a list of eligible toilets and receive up to $100. After a quick search, AJC PolitiFact Georgia found a $160 toilet on the online list.

A Boyer spokeswoman emphasized the toilet ordinance was not the main focus of the commissioner's article. Her target was DeKalb's recently instituted foreclosure registry, which requires banks and other owners of foreclosed homes to register them online. She tried to tank the proposal, but it passed in July.

The spokeswoman also referred us to Robert Broome, a lobbyist with the Atlanta Board of Realtors. Broome told us that the group supports water conservation but opposes DeKalb's rule because it ties the installation of those fixtures to real estate transactions.

The change can be expensive, Broome said. He's been told of cases where homeowners have had to rip up dry wall or old plumbing to comply.

Broadly speaking, toilets can cost just about anything. Consider the porcelain throne of rock royalty John Lennon. It sold in an August auction for about $15,000.

Lee Krinsky, general manager of Plumb Works Inc. in Atlanta, recalled a toilet that cost $13,000, excluding the $1,000 seat. It was hand-painted with a floral design. The seat, which was inlaid with gold, was fashioned in the shape of a seashell.

A more typical low-flow toilet can range from $500 to $800, Krinsky said. This includes the cost of purchasing the toilet, picking it up from the supplier, installing it, and hauling the old one away.

If installation goes smoothly, and most do, a plumber can be in and out of the bathroom in an hour-and-a-half, Krinsky said. Given the high cost of water, the toilet will easily pay for itself.

For another opinion, we talked to Ellen Whitaker, executive director of the Plumbing and Mechanical Association of Georgia. The trade organization once opposed low-flow ordinances but switched positions after the drought.

Plumbers in Whitaker's group were reluctant to give a price range for the job. Variables such as the condition of the old toilet and plumbing can make it hard to predict, she said.

Consider the toilet flange, Whitaker said. The ring connects the toilet to a drain pipe and stops smells from seeping up through the commode. If the flange is stuck in place, a plumber might spend extra hours removing it.

This means $1,000 ""can be a good price,"" Whitaker said.

Of course, you could install the toilet yourself. If you purchased that $160 toilet we found online, hauled it home yourself, got the $100 rebate, and encountered no unusual problems, your grand total would be $60, plus tax.

A low-flow toilet can cost as little as dinner and a movie or as much as a Toyota Corolla.

The cost of professional installation varies, but can often fall in the $500 to $800 range. Do-it-yourselfers can spend less than $100, thanks to DeKalb's rebate program.

If the job costs more than $1,000, you can get a waiver.

Very strictly speaking, Boyer's right. Installing a low-flow toilet ""can"" cost up to $1,000.

But in many cases, it will cost much less.

Boyer's claim could have used more explanation and context, but much of it holds water. We therefore rule it Half True.

Oregon Healthy Kids says no matter how much you make, you qualify for health care program
","

Back in 2009, the Oregon Legislature passed a 1 percent tax on health insurance premiums (paid by the insurance companies and passed on to the customers) and used the revenues to expand health care coverage for children through Oregon Healthy Kids.

We’ve covered some squabbles over that tax and the program here and here.

So, naturally, our interest was piqued when the subject cropped up again recently. This time It came by way of Oregon Catalyst, a conservative political website and a picture it posted of an Oregon Healthy Kids billboard.

Flying above pictures of healthy kids and their families and physicians is the sentence ""No family earns too much to qualify.""

Sure, the program has been expanded, but could that possibly be true? Or, as Oregon Catalyst poses the question: ""Can anyone explain this? It seems like anyone is entitled to government service whether you need it or not.""

We decided to check in with Cathy Kaufmann, manager of the Healthy Kids Office, and see whether it’s true that any family can qualify for the program.

""Any Oregon family with an uninsured child has a path to Healthy Kids regardless of income,"" she said. However, that insurance may come at a cost that makes it -- for most people -- essentially out of reach.

Any family can get insurance through the Healthy Kids Connect program, Kaufmann explains, but some will pay more than others. Families earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level (about $44,000 a year for a family of four) qualify for free child health care. Families earning between 200 and 300 percent of the federal poverty level (about $66,000 for a family of four -- also Oregon’s median income) qualify for subsidized health care on a sliding scale.

Now for the third category: Those families making more than 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Well, they could still enroll their children through Healthy Kids Connect, but they won’t get any financial break, Kaufmann said. In fact, because the Healthy Kids coverage is so comprehensive -- it covers medical, dental and vision care -- they’ll be paying a pretty high yearly premium. Possibly as much as $3,400, according to a rate sheet posted on the Healthy Kids website.

So, it seems, the billboard is factually accurate. Any family can qualify, whether they make $1 a year or $1 billion. That said, it seems to us Oregon Healthy Kids could have been more precise in their advertising: Families do have to meet certain income limits to qualify for assistance. We rate this claim Mostly True.

R.I. ACLU director says more than half of state's foreign-born population is white
","
Governor-elect Lincoln Chafee's  promise to rescind the executive order on immigration enacted by his predecessor, Donald Carcieri, has brought Rhode Island's simmering immigration debate back to life.

Supporters of the 2008 order say it has given the state new tools to curb illegal immigration, but critics, the Rhode Island affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union among them, say it hasn't worked and has marginalized the Hispanic community.

One of the order's eight directives requires the state police to work with federal authorities to help enforce immigration laws.

In a Nov. 20 Providence Journal story and in a subsequent letter to Chafee, ACLU Director Steven Brown decried the fact that 77 percent of the people investigated by the state police for suspected immigration violations were born in Latin American countries, despite the fact that ""over half of the foreign-born population in Rhode Island is white.""

That statistic about the foreign-born population caught our attention, so we decided to put it to the Truth-O-Meter.  

Brown directed us to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, 2006-2008, which includes three-year estimates of foreign-born populations in the United States. Specifically, he said he was citing the figures showing that 45.2 percent of foreign-born Rhode Islanders are white. 
That's not more than half.

The ACLU director conceded that he misread the data and meant to say ""'almost half' not ''over half.' "" 
Fair enough. But things get more complicated when you dig deeper into census figures to examine the point behind Brown's statement -- that Hispanics are being investigated more often than non-Hispanics.

The U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey is an ongoing statistical
analysis that's conducted  through questionnaires on various demographic topics mailed monthly to homes; the bureau produces reports as often as once a year.

The survey asks respondents to identify their race. Among the choices: white, black or African American, Asian, American Indian and Alaska native, native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander.

There is no option to select Hispanic.

That's because, according to the U.S. Census, ""Hispanic"" is an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics and Latinos have the option of checking off one of the above races or a final box labeled ""some other race,"" according to Arthur Bakis, information services specialist at the bureau's Boston regional office.

The race standards are defined by the federal Office of Management and Budget and have been in place for decades, according to Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center in Washington, D.C.

Typically, about half of foreign-born Hispanic respondents across the United States identify themselves as white and about 40 percent answer ""some other race,"" said Charles A. Gallagher, chairman of the sociology department at La Salle University in Philadelphia.

The 45.2 percent statistic that Brown cited for Rhode Island was the total percentage of foreign-born people here who identified their race as white. So on its face, Brown's ""more than half"" statement was not too far off.

But there is a broader context to consider. The more relevant statistic to Brown's point comes from the previous question on the same survey. It asks respondents whether they are of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin, or not.

Drawing from data in the 2006-2008 survey, the census said that 32 percent of foreign-born people, about one third, are white alone, not Hispanic or Latino.

Bakis of the Census Bureau and Passel of the Pew Hispanic Center agree that is the data that Brown should have used if he wanted to properly quantify the size of Rhode Island's foreign born, non-Hispanic white population.

""It's a mistake that people who are not familiar with the data might make,"" said Passel.

(It's worth noting that Brown cites figures from the 2006-2008, three-year American Community Survey. A one-year report from 2009 showed that 30 percent of Rhode Island respondents identified themselves as ""white alone, not Hispanic or Latino."" But Census officials say the three-year survey is more accurate, so that's the one we relied on.)

In the end, Brown's underlying claim that the state police investigate Hispanics more often than non-Hispanics for immigration violations is supported by the department's own numbers. Of the 92 people investigated, 71 were from Latin American countries.

But that's not what we were checking. Instead, we examined the assertion Brown made to support his argument: that more than half of foreign-born Rhode Islanders are white.

And in that claim, he misstated the percentage -- by a small amount if you count all who said they were white, but a larger amount if you count those who consider themselves white alone, not Hispanic or Latino.

Adm. Mike Mullen says past arms treaty ratifications have been bipartisan
","
As the House and Senate move into a brief lame-duck session before the new Congress begins work in January, one issue on the table is whether the Senate will ratify a new START treaty to control nuclear arms, as the Obama Administration wants. 
The treaty would enact modest nuclear-weapons reductions and extend verification provisions that lapsed last year. Most Democrats and many foreign-policy professionals favor ratification of the new treaty, which would require 67 votes in the Senate. But the effort has run into problems with Senate Republicans. 
The Senate Republicans' leading spokesman on the issue, Minority Whip Jon Kyl of Arizona, said earlier this month that the lame duck session did not offer enough time to iron out problems he sees with a related issue -- U.S. plans for modernizing nuclear forces and infrastructure. The administration took up the gauntlet, redoubling its efforts to ratify the treaty this year. 
In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, Vice President Joe Biden wrote that ""national security interests are at stake"" in the ratification battle. But Republicans countered that the need for speed was overblown. In a separate item, we checked a statement by Kyl on NBC's Meet the Press in which he cited reports by the Washington Post and the Associated Press to justify his position that failure to ratify the new START treaty immediately would not threaten national security. 
Now we'll take a look at an earlier comment by Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In an interview on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour on Nov. 21, 2010, the host asked the nation's top military officer whether the Senate is ""playing politics with American national security.""

Mullen responded, ""Well, you'd have to ask the Senate about that.""

Amanpour pressed him, asking, ""What do you think?""

Mullen replied, ""Well, certainly, what I think is that there is a sense of urgency with respect to ratifying this treaty that needs to be ... recognized. Historically this has been bipartisan. This is a national security issue of great significance. And the sooner we get it done, the better.""

We wondered whether Mullen is correct that most prior arms-control treaties have been passed with bipartisan support.

We began by determining which treaties we should include in our assessment. We turned first to the list of ""treaties and agreements"" handled by the State Department's Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance.

We only looked at formal treaties, which require a two-thirds vote by the Senate in order to be ratified. (A quick reminder: Treaties are negotiated and signed by representatives of the president, then ratified by the Senate. Once a few additional logistical steps are taken, treaty adherence is made official.) We also stuck to treaties that were primarily designed as arms control efforts, particularly when they dealt with weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, biological and chemical.

By our count, the Senate has ratified 14 such treaties in 13 votes. Here's the list in chronological order, along with the year of U.S. ratification and the tally for and against in the Senate:

• Limited Test Ban Treaty, 1963 -- 80-19.

• Non-Proliferation Treaty, 1969 -- 83-15. (Seven Democrats and eight Republicans voted against.)

• Latin American Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty, 1971 -- 70-0.

• Seabed Arms Control Treaty, 1972 -- 83-0.

• Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, 1972 -- 88-2. (U.S. later withdrew.)

• Biological Weapons Convention, 1974 -- 90-0.

• Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, 1988 -- 93-5.

• Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty and Threshold Test Ban Treaty, 1990 -- 98-0 (to ratify both treaties).

• Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, 1991 -- 90-4.

• Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, also known as START I, 1992 -- 93-6. (Expired 2009.)

• Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II, also known as START II, 1996 -- 87-4.

• Chemical Weapons Convention, 1997 -- 74-26 (with 29 Republicans joining 45 Democrats in voting yes and 26 Republicans voting no.).

• Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, also known as the Moscow Treaty, 2003 -- 95-0.

This list demonstrates that at least 13 treaties presented to the Senate for ratification passed by overwhelming majorities -- and with strong bipartisan support. The strongest opposition came in the vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention. But the opponents, led by the late Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., could not muster enough support either on amendments to the treaty or the treaty ratification vote itself to derail it. An additional historical footnote that bolsters the notion of bipartisanship: Thirteen of the 14 treaties above were ratified when one party held the presidency and the other party held the Senate.

There is, however, one example of a weapons treaty actually being voted down on the Senate floor. In 1999, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty fell, 51-48, with all but four Republicans voting no. (Sens. John Chafee, R-R.I., James Jeffords, R-Vt., Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., voted for the treaty, along with all Democrats except for Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who voted present.)

In remarks after the Senate vote, President Bill Clinton presaged what some Democrats have argued this month.

""In recent days, members of the Congressional majority have displayed a reckless partisanship,"" Clinton said. ""It threatens America's economic well-being and now our national security. Yesterday, hard-line Republicans irresponsibly forced a vote against the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. This was partisan politics of the worst kind because it was so blatant and because of the risks it poses to the safety of the American people and the world.""

So the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is a clear exception to Mullen's claim. Whether there are additional examples is murkier.

We found two nuclear-related treaties from the Clinton era that were signed but never ratified by the U.S. -- the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty and the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. But in talking to experts, we found no evidence that either treaty was targeted for opposition based on partisan lines. In fact, according to a 1996 Chicago Tribune report, just days after the Clinton Administration signed the African treaty protocols, it clarified that the treaty would not prevent the U.S. from using nuclear weapons against Libya. So reservations about the African treaty don't appear to be based on partisanship.

In addition, the second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, or SALT II, was signed by President Jimmy Carter but never ratified. While the negotiations over the treaty were somewhat contentious, the immediate reason for not pursuing ratification was the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1980, a rationale that had bipartisan support.

Another treaty that faced significant partisan opposition was the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, which failed to advance to a vote in the Senate due to opposition by conservatives who expressed concern about its impact on U.S. sovereignty. But the subject of this treaty seems too far afield from what Mullen was talking about for us to count it.

So where does this leave us? We found one clear example of partisan opposition to a nuclear-weapons treaty -- the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty -- but 13 which were passed with broad, bipartisan support. So we rate Mullen's contention that Senate treaty ratifications have ""historically ... been bipartisan"" as True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/30/michael-mullen/adm-mike-mullen-says-past-arms-treaty-ratification/

Sen. Jon Kyl says Obama nuclear arms policy is a ""march toward zero""
","
In a discussion of the new START treaty on NBC's Meet the Press on Nov. 29, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) outlined several reservations he has with the proposed treaty to control nuclear arms.

Kyl said he had concerns with provisions related to such things as missile defense and modernization of the nuclear arsenal.

But more than that, Kyl said he has a major philosophical difference with President Barack Obama's administration with regard to arms control -- namely whether the goal should be for a world free from all nuclear weapons.

""You have questions extraneous to the treaty but within the context, which is, is this all that's standing between us today and the administration trying to negotiate even deeper, further cuts, which it's indicated that it wants to do in its march toward global zero, something that a lot of us disagree with,"" Kyl said.

We looked into several comments made by Kyl about the new START treaty, but here, we are weighing whether it's accurate to characterize the Obama administration's position on nuclear arms as a ""march toward global zero.""

There's little question that Obama's stated goal -- even before he became president -- has consistently been a world free of nuclear weapons.

Some examples:

* A presidential campaign position paper on foreign policy promised that Obama ""will make the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide a central element of U.S. nuclear policy.""

* In his defining speech on nuclear weapons as president, Obama on April 5, 2009, told an audience in Prague, ""So today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.""

* And in remarks at the United Nations Security Council Summit on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Nuclear Disarmament on Sept. 24, 2009, Obama said, ""The historic resolution we just adopted enshrines our shared commitment to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons. And it brings Security Council agreement on a broad framework for action to reduce nuclear dangers as we work toward that goal.""

In that United Nations speech, Obama quoted former President Ronald Reagan, who said, ""A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. And no matter how great the obstacles may seem, we must never stop our efforts to reduce the weapons of war. We must never stop until all -- we must never stop at all until we see the day when nuclear arms have been banished from the face of the Earth.""

""That is our task,"" Obama said. ""That can be our destiny. And we will leave this meeting with a renewed determination to achieve this shared goal.""

So there is no debate that a ""march toward global zero"" has been Obama's stated goal. But just how fast does Obama plan to march?

In every case, Obama's statements about working toward a world without nuclear weapons are closely followed by a major qualification:

""America will not disarm unilaterally,"" Obama stated in the campaign literature. ""Indeed, as long as states retain nuclear weapons, the U.S. will maintain a nuclear deterrent that is strong, safe, secure and reliable.""

""I'm not naive,"" Obama said in Prague. ""This goal will not be reached quickly -- perhaps not in my lifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change. We have to insist, 'Yes, we can.'""

That's why, in 2008, PolitiFact gave a False rating to a claim in a chain e-mail that Obama wants to ""unilaterally disarm our nation.""

In fact, Obama's nuclear policy closely mirrors that espoused by George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger and Sam Nunn in two opinion pieces published in the Wall Street Journal in 2007 and 2008. In the second piece, titled ""Toward a Nuclear-Free World,"" they wrote that, ""Progress must be facilitated by a clear statement of our ultimate goal. Indeed, this is the only way to build the kind of international trust and broad cooperation that will be required to effectively address today's threats. Without the vision of moving toward zero,
we will not find the essential cooperation required to stop our downward spiral. In some respects, the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons is like the top of a very tall mountain. From the vantage point of our troubled world today, we can't even see the top of the mountain, and it is tempting and easy to say we can't get there from here. But the risks from continuing to go down the mountain or standing pat are too real to ignore. We must chart a course to higher ground where the mountaintop becomes more visible.""

The authors have significant foreign policy experience: Shultz was secretary of state under Ronald Reagan; Perry was defense secretary under Bill Clinton; Kissinger was secretary of state under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford; and Nunn was chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. And their policy was supported by numerous foreign policy experts at the time. But not all. Some foreign policy experts argued that their proposal would be difficult, if not impossible, to implement.

Kyl's statement about Obama's ""march toward global zero"" may have been a bit of a bumper sticker slogan, but it was also ""completely accurate"" and an ""unusually candid"" assessment of the differing philosophies on nuclear arms reduction, said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Web site that specializes in information about defense, the military, weapons of mass destruction and homeland security.

""There are two different churches that people go to on this issue,"" Pike said. ""I think Kyl worships at the church that nuclear weapons are a good thing,"" he said. Kyl's position is that nuclear weapons can't be uninvented, he said, and that the U.S. wouldn't be as safe without them. ""And that's not the church that Mr. Obama attends.""

Some may argue over how quickly Obama intends to ""march toward global zero"" -- Obama has said he's not even sure it's possible in his lifetime. Obama has always noted that as long as other countries retain nuclear weapons, the United States will maintain a strong nuclear arsenal. Nonetheless, Obama has consistently and repeatedly stated that his ultimate goal is to enact policies that bring the world closer to his ultimate goal: a world without nuclear weapons. And so we rate Kyl's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/30/jon-kyl/sen-jon-kyl-says-obama-nuclear-arms-police-march-z/

Alan Grayson going down swinging on Bush tax cut extension
","
File this under the category of things that won't surprise you -- Alan Grayson isn't leaving office quietly.

The Orlando Democrat who lost his bid for re-election took to the U.S. House floor on Nov. 17, 2010, to rail against Republicans who want to extend the Bush 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for all Americans, including the wealthiest 1 percent of income earners.

With a series of cardboard posters, Grayson mocked Republicans for more than five minutes. ""The Republican plan for tax cuts is to give each millionaire -- each person who makes $1.4 million a year on average, the top 1 percent of income in this country, the high and mighty -- $83,347 a year in tax cuts,"" Grayson said, turning to his posters.

Grayson said the wealthiest could use the money to buy a 2011 Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan, once a year, every year for the next decade. Or they could buy a Hermes ""Birkin"" handbag every year or a bottle of 1787 Chateau d'Yquem wine.

""Here's something else they can do,"" Grayson said, showing the next poster. ""They can buy 20,000 jars of their favorite mustard, Grey Poupon. Twenty thousand jars. That's certainly enough for them, their family, their friends, even a few poor people.

""Thank you Republican Party.""

Grayson came back on Nov. 18, 2010, and continued poking the GOP -- saying the money could be used to buy three tickets to the most expensive suite at the Super Bowl, to climb Mt. Everest, or for a 110-day couple's cruise around the world. (""Not just one year, but every single year,"" he said.)

Grayson's point is that the money could be better used creating jobs than going to America's top earners. That the country could essentially take the money and hire 3 million people at $30,000 a year, creating jobs instead of lining the pockets of the rich. There's some false logic in his thinking, at least from the Republican point of view. Republicans say it's those top earners who create jobs and taking money out of their pockets will cost jobs. Grayson also certainly is guilty of hyperbole in suggesting that the rich will use the money saved from the tax cuts only on outrageous luxury items.

But that's all a philosophical debate we'll let you have at your dinner tables.

For PolitiFact Florida, we wanted to zero in on his baseline number, that the Republican plan for extending the 2001, 2003 and other Bush-era tax cuts would result in the top 1 percent of earners paying $83,347 a year less in taxes.

Grayson said his figure comes from an analysis provided by a liberal public policy group called Citizens for Tax Justice.

Citizens for Tax Justice Legislative Director Steve Wamhoff backs up Grayson's numbers, saying that if all of the tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of this year remain in place, the top 1 percent of earners will save $83,347 on average. But there's more to the story, Wamhoff said.

First, extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for everyone isn't exactly ""the Republican plan.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced a bill on Sept. 13 that would extend most of the Bush-era tax cuts, and would restore the estate tax, at some level, for some people. The effect of the McConnell bill is that the top 1 percent of income earners would see a total cut of $74,621, according to Citizens for Tax Justice.

Another bill filed on Nov. 17 by Republicans Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana and Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina would permanently repeal the estate tax for everyone, meaning the top 1 percent would see the cut suggested by Grayson -- $83,347, using Citizens for Tax Justice numbers.

And there's a second caveat. Democrats, including President Barack Obama, want to extend some of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans too. Just not to the extent that Republicans do.

While President Obama's preferred alternative is to extend the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts for only those individuals making $200,000 or less and couples making $250,000 or less, he does support extending other tax cuts that would benefit wealthier Americans, including restoring a reduced estate tax. Under Obama's plan, the top 1 percent of earners would pay $28,728 a year less in taxes than they would if all of the tax cuts were allowed to expire at the end of the year, according to Citizens for Tax Justice.

How does this all add up?

If all of the tax cuts are allowed to expire, the wealthiest 1 percent will pay around $83,347 a year more in federal taxes on average.

If President Obama's plan is approved, the wealthiest 1 percent will pay about $54,619 a year more in federal taxes than they do now.

If McConnell's bill passes, they'll pay $8,726 a year more.

And if the DeMint/Pence plan passes, they'll pay the same amount.

Now we know you're probably wondering if Citizens for Tax Justice's numbers are credible, especially since they define themselves as being liberal. We did, too. So we also checked with the Tax Policy Center, an independent, nonpartisan think tank. They didn't measure things exactly like Citizens for Tax Justice, but they did corroborate one critical fact. They found that if President Obama's tax plan becomes law, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans would pay $53,674 a year more, on average, in federal taxes (CTJ's number was $54,619).

We also found research from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation -- a nonpartisan committee with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants -- that helps illustrate the same point, though by using slightly different criteria. The Joint Committee on Taxation found that, for those who have income of $1 million or more, extending all of the Bush tax cuts would mean $32.7 billion that the government would not collect in 2011. That amount would apply to 315,000 tax filers. Divide the foregone tax revenues by the number of filers, and you get $103,809 per tax filer. That's a bigger number than Citizens for Tax Justice, but also applies to a different pool of people.

And it substantiates Grayson's broader point, which is that extending the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans means they will save a lot of money in federal taxes.

In a pair of dramatic House floor speeches, he said that the Republican plan to extend the Bush-era tax cuts would result in the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans saving $83,347 a year. He's quoting a study from the group Citizens for Tax Justice accurately, and the math is largely backed up by the more independent Tax Policy Center. But he neglects to mention that another GOP-embraced tax plan would shrink the tax savings of the wealthiest Americans slightly and that a significant chunk of the tax cuts he's talking about are also supported by Democrats and President Obama.

Governor-elect Scott Walker says Milwaukee-to-Madison high-speed rail line is dead
","
After weeks of discussion, maneuvering and protests, Governor-elect Scott Walker is taking a sharp new tack on the proposed Madison-Milwaukee high-speed rail link.

Walker transition director John Hiller issued this statement Nov. 18, 2010: ""The Madison-Milwaukee train line is dead.""

It was quoted in the JSOnline story headlined ""Rail backers turn up heat on Walker"" and repeated on television, and again several days later in USA Today.

Hiller may as well have quoted directly from Meinhardt Raabe, the late Jefferson County, Wis., actor who played the Munchkin coroner in the ""Wizard of Oz"":

""As Coroner I must aver, I thoroughly examined her. And she's not only merely dead, she's really most sincerely dead.""

At issue, of course, is the $810 million federal grant the state sought and won to extend Amtrak service from Milwaukee to Madison. The project is to be one link in a Midwest network of new high-speed rail service. Walker argues the state can not afford the operating expense of the train and has vowed to kill the project.

As recently as Nov. 10, Hiller put it all in the future tense: ""Governor-elect Scott Walker is going to fulfill his campaign promise to stop the construction of the Madison-Milwaukee train line.""

So what changed? Is the train really most sincerely dead even before Walker takes office?

First, although it was Hiller who made the comment, he’s a Walker appointee. When we followed up with Walker’s office, transition spokesman Cullen Werwie simply repeated the statement. As such, we’ll treat it as a statement from Walker himself.

In many ways, the comment recalls one made by U.S. Transportation Secretary Raymond LaHood, who declared at a Labor Day rally in Milwaukee: ""It’s coming. Nobody can stop this train.""

It was stated as fact, not an opinion or promise or prediction of the future. We looked at that statement and ruled it False, noting there were many ways Walker, once in office, could kill the project.

The key, of course, was once in office. And that happens Jan. 3.

In the meantime, there are plenty of people -- including President Barack Obama -- who support this project. And, if anything, the public discussion has recently centered on finding a way to answer one of Walker’s chief objections: the annual state subsidy to operate the train.

That subsidy has been estimated at anywhere between $750,000 and $7.5 million, depending on whether the feds pick up the vast majority of the cost. LaHood’s office declined to discuss the matter with us.

Among the things that could still happen:

An outside group could cover the operating shortfall: Madison Mayor David Cieslewicz has said the city might be willing to help with the operating costs, noting his city’s chamber of commerce and other business groups support the project.

""We’re willing to take a look at some of the operating expenses,"" said Cieslewicz aide Chris Klein. ""If that’s the issue, we’re willing to help.""

So far, there’s no action taken by the Madison City Council on the matter, but the mayor is willing to ""sit down and have a conversation about it,"" said Rachel Strauch-Nelson, communications director.

Congress could take a new look at it:  U.S. Rep. Tom Petri (R-Wisconsin) supported the train for years because that was the wish of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle and his predecessor Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson. But then Petri backed away from it after Walker won. (That earned a Full Flop rating.)

If the project is killed, Petri says, he favors using the money for deficit reduction rather than seeing it spent in other states. But even he’s not writing the obituary just yet.

Petri told PolitiFact Wisconsin the operating cost was relatively minor in the context of the entire state budget -- and he expressed interest in gestures from Madison to help pay the operating costs. Petri, a long-time member of the House Transportation Committee, says he, too, is willing to talk about the project before it’s written off.

""I’d like to see a decision made on a common sense agreed up set of facts,"" Petri said, adding that leaders must decide ""whether it makes sense to pay penalties and back out.""

We asked Walker’s office how they would handle offers from Cieslewicz, Petri, the Obama administration or anyone else. For instance, would Walker support the route if there was no state subsidy involved? Walker’s press secretary Cullen Werwie said the governor-elect team wasn’t going to speculate.

""There’s been a lot of ‘what ifs’,"" Werwie said. ""We haven’t seen any legitimate proposal.""

""He’s following through on his campaign promise"" to stop the train, Werwie said of Walker.

In a Nov. 24, 2010 radio appearance, Walker told WTMJ-AM (620) radio host Charlie Sykes he remains against the train: ""It doesn’t matter where the money goes back to or what it is for."" Walker told Sykes his team has talked with the federal DOT about other possible uses of the money but provided no details.

Meanwhile, the parameters of the discussion have changed in key ways since the Nov. 2 election. And they may continue to change: 
  
  
Beyond all that, two key mechanisms that Walker said he could use to kill the train -- refusing to budget operational funding and canceling contracts -- haven’t happened. And Walker can’t do either until he is in office.

So where does that leave us?

Scott Walker, via a top transition official, says the Madison-Milwaukee train is dead. But train backers -- some with large municipal budgets -- aren’t going away. Neither is the Sierra Club, Wisconsin Citizen Action, organized labor and other groups that have rallied on the project’s behalf. And neither is the Obama administration, which, for now, holds the purse strings on this project. The train may well be on its deathbed, it hasn’t yet passed to the stationhouse in the sky

Just as LaHood’s pronouncement was premature -- and False -- this one is, too.",/factchecks/2010/nov/30/scott-walker/governor-elect-scott-walker-says-milwaukee-madison/

Democrats: State Republicans to blame for unemployment benefit gap
","
When Channel 2 Action News recently reported that the state of Georgia has borrowed several hundred million dollars to pay unemployment benefits, state Democratic Party leaders knew who to blame.

""[Georgia] Republicans have mismanaged unemployment benefits and now might have to cut them or hike taxes on small businesses,"" the party wrote in a Nov. 18 message on its Facebook page.

Some intrepid AJC PolitiFact Georgia readers (disgruntled Democratic politicos, party officials say) alerted us to the posting and asked us to investigate.

The claim took us by surprise since the man in charge of unemployment benefits, Georgia Labor Commissioner Michael Thurmond, is a Democrat.

One of those critics, Andre Walker, objected to the Democratic Party's claim on his website, Georgia Unfiltered. Walker said the Republican-led state Legislature allocated about $47 million a year between 2006 and 2008 for unemployment benefits. In 2009, the total rose to $60 million. Earlier this year, the Legislature approved $56 million. Walker also noted that Thurmond is a Democrat.

""Where's the mismanagement?"" Walker asked in his blog. 
The state Labor Department said the Legislature does not allocate funding for unemployment benefits. Those funds, the department said, come from taxes paid by Georgia employers. 
To sort this all out, let's begin by looking at how the Georgia unemployment program works.

Businesses in Georgia pay into a state fund that the Labor Department uses to pay unemployment when workers are laid off or terminated through no fault of their own. In 1998, Georgia had $1.9 billion in the fund, said Brock Timmons, chief of the Labor Department's employment insurance legal section. In 2003 and 2004, the state paid out about $722 million a year from the fund, Timmons said. In 2009, at the height of the Great Recession, Georgia paid $1.47 billion in unemployment benefits. Georgia's unemployment rate has been above the national average in recent years. It is currently at 9.9 percent; the national average is 9.6 percent.

""It took us by surprise,"" Timmons said of the rising unemployment. 
Some employers, as a result of the tax cuts that took effect between 2000 and 2003, paid little or no money to the unemployment fund.

The percentage Georgia employers paid in the fund increased by 15 percent in 2009 and by 13 percent in 2010.

State officials say Georgia has received advances totaling $454.5 million from the federal government. Georgia must pay back the money but has not set up a timetable to do so. Timmons said Georgia employers could pay more in federal unemployment taxes if the loan isn't repaid by November 2011.

Georgia Democratic Party spokesman Eric Gray told us the Facebook message could have been more precise. He posted a column on Georgia Politico explaining the party's point. The column says state GOP leaders did not make the ""tough choices"" necessary to avert this problem when the recession hit. The column does not say what the ""tough choices"" were.

""With the unemployment fund nearly broke, they reluctantly accepted stimulus money from the federal government to replenish the unemployment fund. This bought them time to address the problem,"" the column says. ""Yet Republicans stuck with what they are good at -- ignoring it even more.""

The column does not specify what state leaders should have done to avoid the current problem of borrowing money from the federal government.

The funds are still managed by the state Labor Department, which is run by a Democrat, not a Republican. Democratic Party officials say they should have been more precise in their description of the problem on Facebook. We agree. We rate it as False.",/factchecks/2010/nov/30/democratic-party-georgia-georgia/state-republicans-blame-unemployment-benefit-gap/

Gov.-elect John Kasich says Ohio's in-classroom education spending doesn't make the grade
","
Incoming governor John Kasich says he has identified a major flaw in Ohio’s public school system: too much money is spent on administrator salaries and far too little on student instruction in the classroom.

""Ohio ranks 46th in the country in putting dollars in the classroom,"" Kasich said the day after the election, disdain in his voice as he drew on a familiar campaign stomping point. He was citing a ranking noted in a 2010 report from the Greater Ohio Policy Center and Brookings Institution.

By that measure, 45 states proportionly spend more in the classroom than Ohio, including neighboring Pennsylvania (17th), Kentucky (31st), and West Virginia (32nd).

Kasich is using the figure to mount a basis for setting his own education funding agenda while promising to scrap one established under current Gov. Ted Strickland. By stating how dismal the state is faring by this measure, Kasich hopes to win support for his own educational initiatives.

But is the ranking accurate? Could nearly every state in the country be applying more cents on the dollar in the classroom than Ohio? State teacher’s unions and other education leaders say the policy center report is misleading and inaccurate.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.

The policy center is a non-partisan policy research group focused on improving Ohio’s economy by strengthening its urban cores. It teamed this year with the nationally known Brookings Institution for its report ""Restoring Prosperity: Transforming Ohio’s Communities for the Next Economy.""  

The policy center report recommended Ohio determine how to spend more money in the classroom. The center’s Executive Director Lavea Brachman said, ""our starting premise is that if we spend less on administrative costs then we can spend more in the classroom.""

Philip Trostel, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Maine, constructed the state-by-state education research for the policy center. He used data collected from the National Center for Education Statistics, an off-shoot of the U.S. Department of Education.

""It’s reliable data that is comparable from state to state,"" Trostel said. ""The individual school districts report the data so it lessens the likelihood that one state is reporting differently from another state.""

In-classroom spending includes items such as teacher salaries, textbooks and technological equipment. New York ranked highest, spending nearly 69 cents of every dollar in classrooms. Indiana ranked 50th at just over 54 cents on the dollar. Ohio, ranked 46th, spends 57.2 cents of every dollar in classrooms, the report found.

The reason Ohio ranks so low in this category, according to the report, is because its public school districts appear to spend a greater percentage of their funds on administrative costs, as compared to most other states.

In fact, Ohio’s spending on district administration for superintendents and other district-level executives is 49-percent higher than the national average, Trostel concludes in the report.  

But the rankings are based on 2007-2008 school year data, the most recent state-by-state figures available from the national reporting clearinghouse. Two full school years have passed, and education leaders under the Strickland administration argue that changes the Democratic leader made to school funding made during that time would yield a much better funding record for Ohio.

""What is Kasich’s education plan?"" Patricia Frost-Brooks, president of the Ohio Education Association wrote in a letter printed by newspapers around the state. ""Kasich’s Website, stump speech and debate performance all repeat the same tired mantra: Ohio ranks 46th on money for the classroom. … The stats ignore the new school-funding formula as well as deep administrative cuts at the Ohio Department of Education.""

The Ohio Department of Education said that it is difficult to duplicate Trostel’s state-by-state research to ensure its accuracy.

""We are unable to analyze the information that is being referenced because it is part of an unpublished study and we’re unsure of the data being used to arrive at the conclusion,"" said Scott Blake, a spokesman for the state Education Department.

In 2009, the state legislature approved Strickland’s evidence-based model school funding plan  which the governor said would, among other things, eventually direct more dollars towards programs that help schoolchildren learn best. It also promises to ensure the state will spend more on public education to lessen the burden on local taxpayers.

But none of that particularly guarantees that Ohio will spend more money in the classroom, just that money being spent could be re-allocated for different instructional purposes.

Kasich has made it clear that he plans to eliminate Strickland’s funding model altogether and introduce his own.

With no recent national data available for comparison, the national ranking that the policy center bestowed on Ohio appears unchallenged. Even the Ohio Education Department admitted that the policy center report’s figures for Ohio appear to be close to accurate, though it can’t say for sure or measure the figures against other states.

It would, however, be useful for Kasich to acknowledge that the figures used for the ranking that he has repeatedly cited are more than two years old. That’s a key piece of information needed for context.

That’s why we rate Kasich’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/30/john-kasich/gov-elect-john-kasich-says-ohios-classroom-educati/

Jon Kyl cites Washington Post editorial, AP fact-check as support for position on START treaty
","
As Washington delves into a brief lame-duck session before the new Congress begins work in January, one issue receiving wide attention is whether the Senate will ratify a new START treaty to control nuclear arms, as the Obama Administration wants. 
The treaty would enact modest nuclear-weapons reductions and extend verification provisions that lapsed last year. Most Democrats and many foreign-policy professionals favor ratification of the new treaty, which would require 67 votes in the Senate. But the effort has run into problems with Senate Republicans, particularly with Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona. 
Kyl said earlier this month that the lame duck session did not offer enough time to iron out problems he sees with a related issue -- U.S. plans for modernizing nuclear forces and infrastructure. The administration took up the gauntlet, redoubling efforts to ratify the treaty this year. In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, Vice President Joe Biden wrote that ""national security interests are at stake"" in the ratification battle. 
On the Nov. 28, 2010, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, host David Gregory grilled Kyl on his concerns about the treaty. We won't get far into the policy details here, but we do think that fact-checking one portion of the dialogue might help illuminate a key element of the debate -- namely, whether delaying ratification would put national security at risk. 
Here's a portion of what Kyl said: 
""First of all, let me quote the Washington Post, which directly addressed the question that you asked. 'No calamity will befall the United States if the Senate does not act this year.' And in response to the charge that somehow we need to do this for the urgency of needing verification, the Associated Press did a fact-check on that allegation and said, 'The urgency is political. Even the administration concedes the security risk is not immediate.'"" 
Essentially, Kyl uses two mainstream news organizations to bolster his argument that there's little risk from a delay in ratification. We wondered whether Kyl used these quotations accurately and in context. 
Let's first look at the excerpt from the Post. It came from an editorial -- that is, an unsigned statement of opinion by the newspaper's editorial board -- titled, ""The New START pact should be passed, not politicized."" Right off the bat, that sounds unlike Kyl's suggestion to take more time. 
Kyl did relay the specific quotation accurately, and the editorial does provide some support for Kyl's position. In addition to arguing that ""no calamity will befall the United States if the Senate does not act this year,"" the editorial argued that ""the Cold War threat of a nuclear exchange between Washington and Moscow is, for now, almost nonexistent. The administration and Congress could advance America's 21st-century interests more tangibly by completing and approving the free-trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama -- to name just one issue that matters more than U.S.-Russian arms control."" 
The editorial also suggested that the administration's urgency to ratify the treaty now may have less to do with foreign policy concerns and more to do with the Senate's balance of power. (Democrats will have a narrower majority in January.) The editorial called Biden's claims of a national security risk ""hyperbole."" 
But a substantial portion of the editorial runs counter to Kyl's view. In fact, it takes Kyl to task personally, saying that he ""acknowledged months ago that the treaty is 'relatively benign'"" and adding that the White House has ""gone a long way to meet (Kyl's) concerns."" Yet ""rather than take yes for an answer, Mr. Kyl blindsided the administration this week with a statement claiming that not enough time remained this year to ratify the treaty given 'the complex and unresolved issues related to START and modernization.' That was hard to credit."" 
In addition, the editorial lists several foreign-policy objectives that could be hurt by delaying ratification. A delay, it argued, ""would put the administration's 'reset' of relations with Russia at risk -- along with Moscow's cooperation on vital matters like Iran's nuclear program and maintaining secure military supply routes to Afghanistan. It might lessen the willingness of nonaligned nations to cooperate with sanctions against Iran and other would-be proliferators. And it could cause both friends and foes of the United States to question Mr. Obama's leadership."" 
In all, the editorial offers a pretty evenhanded approach, rather than one strongly supportive of Kyl's position. ""Both sides would do well to stop maneuvering for political advantage and return to the negotiations that appeared close to winning the necessary support for the treaty before the midterm elections,"" the editorial counseled. 
Now for the Associated Press ""fact check,"" which looked at Obama's statement on Nov. 18 that ""it's about national security. This is not a matter than can be delayed."" 
Under the heading ""The Facts,"" the AP wrote that ""the urgency is political. Next year the Republican ranks in the Senate will expand by six and it will be much more difficult to ratify the treaty. Even the administration concedes that the security risk is not immediate. 'I am not particularly worried, near-term,' Obama's top adviser on nuclear issues, Gary Samore, said Thursday. 'But over time, as the Russians are modernizing their systems and starting to deploy new systems, the lack of inspections will create much more uncertainty.'"" 
The AP continued, ""Intelligence officials have expressed concerns that have sounded less than urgent. 'I think the earlier, the sooner, the better. You know, my thing is: From an intelligence perspective only, are we better off with it or without it? We're better off with it,' the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said recently."" 
While the AP fact-check is less forceful than the Post editorial board was in its criticism of Kyl's position, Kyl, in his Meet the Press interview, did leave out the second, more worried portion of Samore's comments, as well as the argument by Clapper that ""we're better off with"" the treaty in place. 
We try to grant politicians some leeway in television interviews because their comments are necessarily time-constrained. And we certainly understand why Kyl would have wanted to play up the supportive evidence in the two news items and downplay what didn't fit his agenda. But we do think that the way he abridged them amounts to cherry-picking. He selectively quoted from the accounts, leaving viewers with a distinctly different impression than they would have had if they'd read the items in their entirety. So we rate his comment Half True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/29/jon-kyl/jon-kyl-cites-washington-post-editorial-ap-fact-ch/
