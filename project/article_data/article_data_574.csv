Meme says Barack Obama's acceptance of an 'Islamic order and gold medal' was 'unconstitutional'
","In the run-up to President Barack Obama’s recent visit to Saudi Arabia, a reader sent us a Facebook meme that addressed a previous Obama visit to the kingdom. The meme features a pair of photographs of Obama, in what appears to be a Saudi palace, receiving an elaborate medal and necklace over his head. The text says, ""Unconstitutional!!! Accepting an Islamic order and gold medal, 2/2011."" The text of the meme goes on to quote the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 9: ""No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State."" We wondered whether Obama had received an honor from the Saudis, and if so, whether his acceptance of an ""Islamic order and gold medal"" was ""unconstitutional."" After a bit of digging, we discovered that the meme was referring to something that happened in June 2009 -- not February 2011, as the meme had said. It involved the awarding of the King Abdul Aziz Order of Merit, which is considered Saudi Arabia’s highest honor. It’s named for the first monarch of Saudi Arabia, also known as Ibn Saud. (The Saudi Embassy didn’t return an inquiry for this article.) We should also note here that, even though the meme has a distinct anti-Obama tone, President George W. Bush also received the same award in January 2008. After the award was placed around Bush's neck, the Associated Press reported, the president and King Abdullah ""exchanged the region's traditional double kiss. ‘I am honored,’ Bush said."" So, partisans beware: Whatever truth we find for Obama, the same will go for Bush. What does the Constitution say? A look at the Constitution confirms that the meme correctly relays the passage, known as the ""emoluments clause."" The framers included the clause because it signaled an end to hereditary leadership. Not only would the United States avoid granting titles of nobility itself, it would also prevent its leaders from accepting them from other countries. Under the emoluments clause, the president clearly qualifies as a ""person holding any Office of Profit or Trust."" And in this case he certainly received something ""from any King, Prince, or foreign State."" So the key question is this: Does the King Abdul Aziz Order of Merit qualify under one or more of the following categories. Is it a present? An emolument? An office? A title? We can quickly rule out ""office."" But the medallion is certainly a ""present."" Whether it’s an emolument (that is, a ""gain from employment or position"") or a title is a bit more up for grabs. Was it a ""present""? Gifts -- tangible objects of more than trivial value -- are exchanged often in diplomacy, and there’s a well-established system for handling them. The portion of U.S. law known as 5 USC § 7342 (""Receipt and disposition of foreign gifts and decorations"") sets out the conditions under which foreign gifts can be accepted. Essentially, a gift from a foreign country or foreign leader can be accepted on behalf of the United States, as long as it is handed over to an appropriate arm of the federal government, typically the General Services Administration or the National Archives. Often, these gifts find their way to presidential libraries, where the public can view them. The point is that they are property of the government, not the individual recipient. By passing this statute, Congress has essentially offered blanket consent for such acquisitions, without having to consider each one in a separate act. In the Jan. 18, 2011, edition of the Federal Register, the Obama administration officially disclosed the gift (a ""large gold medallion with the Royal seal in a green leather display box"" from ""Abdullah bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"") and confirmed its disposition to the National Archives. So the medallion as a ""present"" appears to pose no constitutional problems. Was it an ""emolument"" or a ""title""? The answer to this question is murkier. On the one hand, J. Peter Pham, director of the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center, said the King Abdul Aziz Order of Merit ""is more than a mere medal. It confers an order, as indicated by its name, even if most people don’t take such things as seriously anymore."" When King Saud created the order in the 1950s, Pham said, it was ""modeled after the various orders of chivalry awarded by European royal houses,"" such as the United Kingdom’s Most Honorable Order of the Bath and Spain’s Order of Isabella the Catholic. Pham said these orders, both Saudi and European, ""are differentiated from medals awarded for military service or civilian achievement. The latter are properly decorations, while the former confer membership, or honorary membership, in a class of individuals which, in former days, would have been referred to as having raised the recipient to the nobility if he or she did not already belong to it."" In a 2009 Washington Post op-ed, Pham and Chapman University law professor Ronald Rotunda argued that ""Washington, Madison and Hamilton would have clearly understood that the Abdul Aziz Order falls under the same ban they had in mind for any public officials coveting awards made under the honors system of the British monarchy."" Other experts, however, say the King Abdul Aziz Order of Merit is more accurately considered an award for civilian achievement, not a grant of nobility. ""All countries have decorations or honors they bestow on both their own citizens and foreigners, usually in recognition of some deed or act, or in the case of foreigners, simply an expression of gratitude for their contribution to the good relations between the two countries,"" said Edward W. Gnehm Jr., a professor at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University. ""Many ambassadors receive similar medals or honors when they are leaving a post. They are certainly not a title, office or emolument."" The ultimate argument against the order conferring a title stems from the specifics of how the Saudi royal family operates. ""It is not a title of nobility, that is for sure,"" said F. Gregory Gause III, a Middle East specialist at the University of Vermont. ""There is only one way into the ‘nobility’ in Saudi Arabia, and that is to be a member of the Al Saud family."" The award, he said, is one ""symbolizing achievement."" Even Pham, who believes it’s fairer to say that acceptance into the order amounts to a title, agrees that the Facebook meme doesn’t describe the situation entirely accurately. Notably, he said, the meme is wrong to say that it’s an ""Islamic order."" ""It is in fact open to non-Muslims, whereas the Saudi Collar of al-Badr is limited to Muslims,"" Pham said. Our ruling The meme says Obama's acceptance of an ""Islamic order and gold medal"" was ""unconstitutional."" Experts agree that Obama’s acceptance of the medallion and collar -- and their transferral to the National Archives -- is entirely constitutional, since the administration followed the longstanding rules on gifts set up by congressional statute. Experts are more divided, however, on whether acceptance of the medallion amounts to acceptance of a foreign title. Meanwhile, the meme errs in calling it an ""Islamic order."" On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A5506AF140>],/factchecks/2014/apr/01/facebook-posts/meme-says-barack-obamas-acceptance-islamic-order-a/

Rick Scott presided over Bright Futures cut, Democratic PAC says
","Republican Gov. Rick Scott paid for college by working at a doughnut shop and getting help from the GI bill. Now he says he wants low-income students to have that same shot at the American dream that he did. Scott has called for lowering the cost of college, including challenging colleges to offer $10,000 degrees. On March 17, 2014, he repeated that message at a college affordability roundtable at Barbara Goleman High School in Miami Lakes. Democrats were watching. American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC, used a video clip of a reporter interviewing Scott at the event to produce an online attack video. While a smiling Scott appears to be standing in a library, a reporter asks: ""In your first year in office you proposed millions of dollars in cuts to public education. Then in 2011-12 over those two years (you) signed off on tuition increases of 13 percent. You presided over cuts to the Bright Futures college scholarship program. To what extent is your recent efforts to boost education and hold the line on costs of education re-election politics?"" ""All of that is incorrect,"" Scott responded, and then the video cuts him off. Text on the screen says, ""Scott approved cuts to Bright Future scholarships,"" followed by, ""Rick Scott is bad for Florida."" We heard the rest of Scott’s defense thanks to a recording by Miami Herald education reporter David Smiley. Scott talked up funding increases for K-12 education, ""record funding for universities"" and his fight to cut higher education tuition -- but he didn’t mention Bright Futures. Education funding has been a hot topic in the race between Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist, the Democratic frontrunner. Here we will examine American Bridge’s charge that Scott presided over cuts to Bright Futures. Bright Futures Launched in 1997, Bright Futures is the college scholarship program funded by the Lottery and designed to keep high-achieving students at Florida schools. The Web ad cites a May 2011 article in The Ledger about Bright Futures cuts approved by the Legislature and Scott during the annual legislative session. American Bridge sent us many other articles that described cuts that year. Why would state legislators want to make the program less generous? They say it’s grown too expensive and that too many students qualify. In an effort to make the scholarships more competitive, they have increased test score requirements, a move that drew the attention of the U.S. Justice Department for making it harder for poorer students of minority backgrounds to get the grant. There are a few ways we can examine cuts to the program, by looking at the total number of students served, the total amount of money disbursed, and the average scholarship amount per student. (There are different levels of Bright Futures awards depending on grades and other factors, but we will cite the overall average.) Here are recent years’ numbers on Bright Futures. The spending picture is not settled for the current and future fiscal years, so we have included an estimate for 2013-14 and the proposed figures for 2014-15.   Year Number of students served Amount of money disbursed Average award per student 2007-08 159,170 $379.8 million $2,387 2008-09 169,366 $429 million $2,533 2009-10 177,612 $423.5 million $2,385 2010-11 179,076 $423.3 million $2,364 2011-12 174,047 $333.8 million $1,918 2012-13 162,980 $312.1 million $1,915 2013-14 estimated 154,160 $309.4 million $2,007 2014-15 proposed 127,573 $266.2 million $2,086 Source: Florida Department of Education At a glance, it appears the total amount of Bright Futures funding nose-dived after Scott took office. Crist vows on his campaign website to reverse the cuts under Scott. Reality is slightly more muddled. The decline in the total number of Bright Futures recipients and the program's total budget is a result of decisions by the Legislature under both Crist and Scott to rein in costs. (We asked the Crist campaign for a response; they didn’t provide one.) The program’s costs spiraled up from an initial price tag of $70 million in 1997 to $437 million in 2011. Some critics said the standards for getting the awards were too easy. In 2010, Crist’s last year as governor, the Legislature reduced Bright Futures scholarships by $1 dollar for every credit hour. The bill also raised SAT/ACT requirements incrementally, which was expected to lead to a drop in the number of students who would qualify. For example, the Legislature raised the minimum SAT requirement for Florida Medallion Scholars -- one subset of Bright Futures -- from 970 in 2010-11 to 1050 in 2013-14. In 2011, Scott’s first year as governor, the Legislature decided to further raise test scores for 2013-14 graduates. For example, those Medallion Scholars would now have to score 1170 on their SAT by 2013-14. Scott’s summary of his proposed 2014-15 budget states his proposal ""fully funds"" the scholarships for eligible students and that the decline in total funds is due to a projected decrease of students because they changed the standards. So both Crist and Scott signed legislation that had the effect of reducing funding for Bright Futures. Our ruling American Bridge’s video said that Scott presided over cuts to the Bright Futures college scholarship program. During his tenure, the program’s total budget and number of students served has dropped. The average award amount under Scott is smaller than during the Crist years. However, it's worth noting that the Legislature under both Crist and Scott tightened eligibility requirements, which reduced the number of students who received the money. Both Crist and Scott signed off on those changes. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A550735D80>],/factchecks/2014/apr/01/american-bridge-21st-century/rick-scott-presided-over-bright-futures-cut-democr/

Nancy Grace talks Oscar Pistorius trial: Could premeditated murder happen 'in the twinkling of an eye'?
","On-air flare-ups between TV pundits trigger our spidey sense here at PunditFact, especially when the hot topic is a murder case gripping the world’s attention. So when Dan Abrams and Nancy Grace got into a spat over the Oscar Pistorius murder trial on Good Morning America, we had to dig in. Pistorius, the paralympian known as ""Blade Runner,"" is accused of murdering his girlfriend, model Reeva Steenkamp, by shooting her with expanding bullets through a bathroom door in his home on Feb. 14, 2013. He admitted to shooting her but says it was an accident because he thought she was an intruder. The prosecution presented its case in March, and Pistorius is expected to take the stand when the trial resumes. Abrams and Grace, who are both attorneys, agreed the prosecution brought a strong case for a murder conviction. But they had sharply different takes on whether there was enough evidence to prove the killing of Steenkamp was premeditated. Abrams said, ""I have not heard a single piece of evidence in this case which says this was a premeditated murder."" ""Premeditation requires planning, it requires thought beforehand. That’s very different from just an intentional murder. He’s charged with premeditated murder here. Look, the reality is this judge could decide intentional murder, that’s still a conviction on murder, it’s a slightly lesser sentence than premeditated. But I don’t know why they’ve pursued a premeditated murder case unless there’s some other evidence that’s going to be presented in this case."" Grace’s turn. ""Well, I know why. And it’s a very common misunderstanding about premeditation. Yes, it is intent. Yes, it is planning. But premeditation can be formed in the twinkling of an eye. That quickly."" There was some overtalk, and Grace continued: ""He came and got the gun out of the holster from under her side of the bed. He had to see, he was on his stumps, which he lied about, he had to see she wasn’t in the bed. He then walked into the bathroom and started firing. And they had had an argument. And the argument as you pointed out earlier, Dan, shows motive for anger. And just because you’re angry that does not denigrate premeditation."" Abrams responded: ""But that’s just a misunderstanding of the law. The bottom line is what Nancy is talking about, about what you can form in an instant, is intent. You can create the intent to commit murder in an instant. You cannot create the intent to create premeditation in an instant. And in fact there’s a case in South Africa..."" Grace cut in: ""The intent to create premeditation? Premeditation is simply planning, and you can plan in a moment of minutes."" ""Whoa, so now we’re minutes?"" Abrams said. ""A moment ago you were saying it’s seconds. So the bottom line is premeditation takes time. You have to plan it out."" Grace: ""Yeah, well, it can be seconds according to the law. Go read your law book. Come back to me after you’ve tried a couple murders."" Sorry for the whole transcript, but it’s a fun read. And it’s all crucial to our fact-check. Disses aside, a reader asked if Grace was right that premeditation could occur in ""the twinkling of an eye."" In South Africa, the site of Pistorius’ trial, the answer could mean the difference between Pistorius spending the rest of his life in prison or getting a lighter sentence. (There’s no death penalty, or juries, in South Africa.) To our question here, legal analysts we consulted said deciding to kill someone in the moments before a murder can be considered premeditation in many American jurisdictions. But that does not necessarily apply in the backdrop of Grace’s statement, South African court, where experts point to case law that suggests premeditation requires more of a plan. Could it happen in the U.S.? Pistorius is charged with murder, and prosecutors want to prove it was premeditated because that warrants the stiffest penalty under South African law, life in prison. The legal analysts on TV were essentially arguing about what kind of sentence he will get. Grace, via a HLN spokeswoman, pointed to case law to back up her point involving U.S. Supreme Court decisions and state Supreme Court appeals of murder cases in Montana and Georgia, which say things like ""premeditation may be formed momentarily"" and ""malice aforethought can be formed instantly."" And American law experts say she has a valid point that just seconds could qualify as premeditated in some states. Planning in many American definitions does not require much time and is basically the opposite of impulse, which usually leads to second-degree murder, said Robert Weisberg, a Stanford University law professor and director of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center. But it’s not uniform. ""The drafters of the American Model Penal Code strongly urged the elimination of the premeditation/intent distinction, but few states follow that guidance,"" Weisberg said. So whether premeditation can occur in an instant in America is nuanced depending upon the jurisdiction. ""That might be true in a Georgia court where she practiced law, but it’s not true in a Florida court,"" said Charles Rose, a professor at Stetson University College of Law. South Africa law ≠ U.S. law The more important question: Could it be true in South Africa? What counts as premeditation is an unsettled area of law decided on a case by case basis, said Kelly Phelps, a University of Cape Town Faculty of Law senior lecturer. Still, jurisprudence suggests it takes time. ""What is clear is that crimes of passion in the heat of the moment will not be premeditation,"" Phelps said. ""It is true that as long as a clear thought is formed and executed, even in a few minutes, this could in theory be premeditation, but not if the killing happen on the spur of the moment out of rage."" Some types of murder that would be considered premeditated in the U.S. would not be considered premeditated in South Africa, said Bob Dekle, a retired assistant state attorney who teaches the prosecution clinic at the University of Florida Levin College of Law. In South Africa, murder is defined as the unlawful and intentional killing of another person. There are three different forms of intent that come into play when a judge is determining the length of a sentence. (Memorize the Latin terms like we did and you’ll seem super informed about this case.) Dolus directus, or direct intent. It was your goal to kill someone. Dolus eventualis, or knowing the possible result of your action will kill someone and recklessly going through with it anyway. It’s akin to second-degree murder, Dekle said. Dolus indirectus, or indirect intent. When a person’s death is a substantially certain outcome of your action, such as committing arson and knowing factory workers will die as a result. The judge could also decide the murder was not intentional and find Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide, or an unlawful negligent killing. In that scenario, Pistorius ought to have foreseen the result of shooting through a door but did not, or he should have known Steenkamp was in the bathroom when shooting through the door, said Marius du Toit, a criminal defense attorney in South Africa who is tracking the case. The court would determine how a reasonable person in Pistorius’ situation would have acted that night and compare it to what he did. The bigger takeaway, Dekle said, is South African law has a high standard for premeditation.  ""When South African law says premeditation, what they mean is a prior plan to murder,"" Dekle said. ""That’s somewhat similar to our concept of cold, calculated and premeditated"" in Florida. On Good Morning America, Abrams tried to reference a South Africa case, Raath vs. The State, a decision cited alongside discussions of what constitutes premeditation, but Grace cut him off. A High Court revisited the case of a man who made his son open a safe so he could retrieve a revolver, which he used to kill his wife across the street moments later. The court reduced his life sentence to 22 years, arguing the lower court erred in deeming the murder as the result of premeditation. Even though there is no concrete definition for the term, the judge wrote, ""clearly the concept suggests a deliberate weighing up of the proposed criminal conduct as opposed to the commission of the crime on the spur of the moment or in unexpected circumstances."" It is correct that from the moment he appeared to conceive the idea of shooting his wife the appellant brooked no opposition and almost immediately proceeded to carry out the terrible deed. However, this does not, in my view, transform what appears to have been the deadly, but spur of the moment act or acts of a man in an emotional rage, into a planned and premeditated murder.  In other words? ""Grace has got it all wrong,"" du Toit, the South African criminal defense attorney, said. ""The period between the forming of the intention and the carrying out of the act is crucial to the test whether premeditation was present. Our courts have said repeatedly that premeditation does not occur on the ‘spur of the moment.’"" The prosecution alleged premeditation in the Pistorius trial to get him to disclose his full version of the events leading up to Steenkamp’s death, du Toit said. Phelps, the law lecturer from South Africa, pointed to several cases, among them State vs. Dyonase, in which the accused killer retaliated to the victim’s previous assault and ransacking of his home by ambushing him as he returned from drinking with another friend and stabbing him to death. The court weighed whether the evidence showed a preconceived design or clear motive, which would prove premeditation. The court ruled the murder was not premeditated, preventing the killer from serving a minimum life sentence. (You can read more cases and Phelps’s commentary in this document.) Our ruling Grace and Abrams wrangled over the definition of premeditated murder, with Grace arguing, ""premeditation can be formed in the twinkling of an eye."" Location, location, location. Legal experts told us it could in some parts of the United States, but it’s not as likely to meet South Africa’s heightened standards for premeditation. While the definition for what counts as premeditation is not finite, legal precedent shows South African courts are likely to require evidence that proves more planning than a ""spur of the moment"" decision. We rate her claim Mostly False. Thanks to our friends at reddit, both in our reddit community and in the /r/law subreddit, for weighing in on this fact-check.

McAuliffe says refusal to expand Medicaid will send Virginia taxpayers' money to other states
","Gov. Terry McAuliffe says the House of Delegates is tossing Virginia taxpayer’s dollars to other states by refusing to expand the Old Dominion’s Medicaid program. ""In America right now, 27 states are going to get our money – Virginia taxpayer money – into their states to provide health care for their citizens, paid for by us,"" McAuliffe, a Democrat, said during a Feb. 26 appearance on WTOP radio. A few days earlier, the Republican-led House rejected a budget amendment to expand eligibility for Virginia’s Medicaid program to 400,000 low-income and disabled Virginians. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, the federal government would pay the entire expansion cost for three years and 90 percent of it down the road. Since then, the sides have dug in on a debate that’s blocking passage of a new two-year state budget. The House last Thursday again rejected the expansion on a partisan vote, with GOP leaders saying the federal government can’t be trusted to pay its promised share. And McAuliffe has been touring the state, repeating that failure to expand Medicaid will send Virginia taxpayers’ money into 27 other other states to insure their working poor. We wondered if the governor is right. First, let’s look at the number 27. It refers to the number of states that have expanded their Medicaid programs and, according to McAuliffe, stand to gain from Virginia’s defiance.   Brian Coy, a spokesman for McAuliffe, said the tally comes from a map of states that have expanded their programs compiled by the National Academy of State Health Policy. A chart by the Kaiser Family Foundation offers the same number. What’s the evidence that Virginia taxpayer’s money will flow to Medicaid recipients in those states if Virginia opts not to expand? ""The Affordable Care Act pays for itself by raising taxes and cutting spending on health care programs,"" Coy emailed. ""If we refuse to close the coverage gap, Virginians will be paying taxes into the federal government that were meant to help fund the ACA, but we will not be bringing our share of that money back home to cover our citizens. Those Virginia tax dollars will instead go toward the funding of the ACA and states that have elected to bring tax dollars back down."" Well, it’s not quite that simple. Obamacare contains a series of new taxes and penalties on: The taxes will generate $570 billion over the next 10 years, according to February projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Virginia’s Senate Finance Committee estimated last year that the Old Dominion would pay about $26 billion in ACA taxes over a decade. The Obamacare levies will flow into the U.S. Treasury where they will mix with perhaps $40 trillion of other tax revenues collected over the next decade and funnelled to federal programs. There are no guarantees under Obamacare that states will reap benefits equal to the new taxes that they pay. So it’s possible that a portion of Obamacare levies paid by Virginians could help expand Medicaid in another state -- or build a military barrack, fund agricultural research or help pay for a multitude of other federal programs. There’s no telling. It’s like trying to tracing a drop of rain that falls into to reservoir to see who’s bath tub it eventually reaches. But here’s the fine point: Virginia’s decision on Medicaid has no effect on the amount of money that will be available to expand the program in other states. ""There’s no finite money for expansion,"" said Edwin Park, vice president of health policy at the liberal Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The expansion extends Medicaid eligibility to households earning up to 133 percent of the U.S. poverty line. Each state that opts in gets federal money based on the number of new Medicaid enrollees it signs up, regardless of what happens in other states. There is no cap on the federal money available for expansion that forces states to compete for shares. Park said McAuliffe’s statement is misleading because other states will not get more money if Virginia opts not to expand Medicaid. Michael Tanner, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed with Park, but said McAuliffe has a valid point. ""To the extent Virginians pay federal income tax, some states will get Medicaid money that Virginia doesn’t,"" he said. Our ruling McAuliffe said that the General Assembly’s refusal to expand Medicaid would send Virginia taxpayers’ money into 27 other states to insure their working poor. He’s right that 27 states have broadened Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. And if Virginia doesn’t join suit, it will sacrifice federal dollars that would pay the overwhelming long-term cost of the expansion. Virginians, like residents of all states, are subject to new taxes to help support the ACA. The payments pour into the U.S. Treasury where they are mixed with other tax dollars and piped out to federal programs. There’s no tracking of individual coins in this flow of money and it’s possible that some deposits from Virginia could end up helping Medicaid recipients in other states. But contrary to McAuliffe’s statement, there’s no direct connection between Virginia’s decision on expansion and what happens to Medicaid in other states. The goal of expansion is to offer Medicaid insurance to people earning up 133 percent of the U.S. poverty line. States participating in the program will receive the same federal subsidy for each new enrollee regardless of whether Virginia participates. So McAuliffe’s statement has an element of truth but gives an incorrect impression on the impact turning down the money would have. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DBD4B00>],/factchecks/2014/mar/31/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-legislatures-refusal-expand-medicai/

Viral meme says United States has 'invaded' 22 countries in the past 20 years
","A Facebook meme argues that Americans are pretty two-faced when it comes to Russia’s recent annexation of Crimea. The meme says, ""22 Countries Invaded by the U.S. in 20 Years. Russia Does It and Everyone Loses Their Mind,"" illustrating its point with a photograph of Heath Ledger’s Joker character from Batman movie The Dark Knight. A reader asked us to check this claim, so we did. Fortunately, the post that accompanied the meme listed the nations that had been ""invaded,"" along with the years of the purported invasion. (We should point out the list is misnumbered and actually names 23 nations, not 22. And the time span is actually about 30 years, not 20.) Before we get to the list, which you can view here, we first need to define our terms. What qualifies as ""invaded""? Defining invading Several foreign-policy experts told us that while ""invaded"" is a familiar word in general conversation, it is used much less commonly in international law. ""Aggression"" and ""conquest"" are more common, and a variety of international agreements attempt to define them. ""The basic problem that is that everyone understands that some actions which are ‘invasions’ are nonetheless right and proper, and some are not,"" said Ted R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""The world being what it is, people do not agree on exactly which actions those are."" When we asked Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service Anthony Clark Arend for his advice, he proposed a standard we could use to judge the meme’s claim. He said an ""invasion"" should meet each of the following three conditions: • It violated the U.N. Charter, which says in Article 2, Paragraph 4 that member countries shall refrain ""from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state."" • It didn’t qualify as a permitted exception for the use of force under the U.N. Charter. The charter permits military action in the case of ""self-defense if an armed attack occurs"" or if the U.N. Security Council authorizes armed force. • It involves ground troops entering another country. Given those parameters, we went through the Facebook post’s examples, categorizing the countries from most like an invasion to least like an invasion. There are two dozen examples here, so it’s going to take us some time to go through them all. Three cases clearly can be considered ""invasions"" Three instances would qualify as ""invasions"" under Arend’s framework without much argument. All were done without United Nations support and involved ground troops. • Grenada. Following a power struggle on the small Caribbean nation, President Ronald Reagan sent troops into Grenada on Oct. 25, 1983, with the mission of protecting American nationals and assisting ""in the restoration of law and order."" A force of about 5,000 American troops and 300 from nearby islands prevailed, evacuating several hundred Americans, and restoring a representative form of government. In all, 18 American forces were killed and 116 were wounded. While the invasion followed a request by five members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution of disapproval. A U.N. Security Council resolution of disapproval failed due to a U.S. veto. • Panama. Ironically, one of the clearest invasions wasn’t even on the list backing up the meme. Between 1988 and 1990, Panama experienced a period of instability stemming from the indictment of its leader, Manuel Noriega, for money laundering and drug trafficking charges. In December 1989, President George H.W. Bush ordered troops into the country to support 10,000 permanently stationed there. Their mission was to protect American lives and facilities, capture Noriega, and support establishment of a United States-recognized government. These goals were accomplished, with 23 American forces killed and 324 wounded. As in the case of Grenada, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion, but the United States, joined by the United Kingdom and France, vetoed a resolution of disapproval in the U.N. Security Council. • Iraq. When the United States led an invasion of Iraq in 2003 to oust Saddam Hussein, it did not have United Nations approval, and in fact, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan at the time called the U.S. invasion ""illegal."" So these are the easy cases. What about the rest? Seven cases might qualify as ""invasions"" if you use a broader definition Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University in Lawton, Okla., said you could also use a broader definition for ""invasion"" -- namely, the seizure of territory by military force from the government of another country, regardless of motivation or justification. •  Using this framework, U.S. military actions in Kuwait and Iraq in 1991 and in Afghanistan in 2001 would count as ""invasions,"" even though each had a basis for support under international law. •  A 1992 U.N.-backed, U.S.-led intervention in Somalia began as a humanitarian action but later morphed into a shooting war after militants attacked. This was in some ways an invasion, though the state of anarchy in Somalia suggests the territory taken was not controlled by ""the government of another country."" •  In 1994 and 1995, the United States received U.N. backing to reinstall ousted Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the president of Haiti, sending 20,000 troops at the peak. (Haiti was also omitted from the meme’s list.) •  The interventions in Bosnia and Kosovo by the United States and NATO in the 1990s might also qualify as ""invasions"" using this definition. In Bosnia, the U.N. supported military action, and while it didn’t officially in Kosovo, Annan was quoted saying, ""It is indeed tragic that diplomacy has failed, but there are times when the use of force may be legitimate in the pursuit of peace."" • Finally, the 2011, U.N.-approved NATO campaign to oust Muammar Qaddafi in Libya might also qualify as an ""invasion,"" though the United States didn’t send ground troops, making the label somewhat questionable. (This, like Haiti, was inexplicably omitted from the meme’s list.) So in addition to three clear instances of ""invasions"" that lacked standing under international law, we have an additional seven actions that could be called ""invasions"" but without the meme’s pejorative use of the word, since they did have international backing. Fourteen cases simply aren’t ""invasions"" The rest of the examples cited in the meme do not qualify as ""invasions"" under any widely recognized definitions, experts say. They fall into a handful of categories. • Humanitarian or disaster assistance. This category includes Zaire, now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the U.S. military helped with refugees in 1996 and 1997 during the genocide in neighboring Rwanda. • Evacuation or protection of American citizens. This covers several cases of troops being sent to Liberia, Albania and Yemen, the last in the wake of the 2000 USS Cole bombing. • Service as U.N. peacekeepers. This covers a number of deployments to the Balkans, including a U.S. presence in Macedonia. • Deployments requested by the country in question. This covers the stationing of American  forces in Saudi Arabia prior to the Persian Gulf War in 1990 and 1991. It also describes military involvement in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru in which the United States answered a request for military assistance to counter narco-trafficking, as well as assistance to Uganda and other African nations begun in 2011 to capture Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, a guerrilla group. And this category also covers Niger, which reached an accord with the United States in 2013 that would allow intelligence gathering and drone operations targeting neighboring Mali, which was grappling with advances by al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb. • Airstrikes. This includes the Aug. 20, 1998, strikes ordered by President Bill Clinton against targets in Sudan, after receiving intelligence -- later questioned -- of a link with the al Qaida bombing of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. This also increasingly includes drone attacks against alleged terrorist targets in countries such as Yemen. While these are clearly aggressive acts by the United States, they do not fit any conventional definition of invasion because they do not seek to take territory or overthrow a government. • Covert operations. During its battle against international terrorism, the United States has often used covert operations, such as in the killing of Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan and inside Mali. As with airstrikes, these are aggressive actions, but due in part to the small number of troops involved, they do not fit the traditional definition of ""invasion."" • No troops sent to the country. The United States took sides in Angola during a long-running civil war in the 1980s, but it is not believed to have sent military troops to the country. And the United States has not committed troops during the ongoing civil war in Syria. And one that’s ridiculous The meme cites the Virgin Islands, where President George H.W. Bush sent 1,000 military police following Hurricane Hugo in 1989. In reality, this can’t be an invasion because he sent them to the U.S. Virgin Islands — part of the United States. ""If the point of the meme is to say the U.S. is sometimes a bully, or that we meddle in the affairs of many countries, that's hard to argue,"" Janda said. ""But we don't invade sovereign states very often, and when we do we eventually leave, unless the host government asks us to stay. Even then, we don't annex foreign territory. We haven't done that since 1898."" The difference with Russia in Crimea, Janda added, is that they ""invaded and have already moved to annex the region. That's a textbook case of aggression and conquest, regardless of the casualties and what the opinion polls say in Crimea."" Our ruling The Facebook meme said that the United States has ""invaded"" 22 countries in the past 20 years. Using the clearest standard -- ground troops seizing foreign territory without the backing of international law -- then the actual number of U.S. invasions in the past 30 years is three. An additional seven military actions that were supported by international law might perhaps be called ""invasions"" in a technical sense, even though they had official justification. The remaining examples cited by the meme aren’t even close to any conventional definition of ""invasion."" We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E9C5AC0>],/factchecks/2014/mar/31/facebook-posts/viral-meme-says-united-states-has-invaded-22-count/
"['Debt', 'Federal Budget', 'Voting Record', 'Texas', 'CATPAC']","
U.S. Rep. Ralph Hall of Texas voted to increase debt limit several times
","You have to go a long way back to trace U.S. Rep. Ralph Hall’s voting record. A conservative political action committee claimed the Northeast Texas Republican ""has never voted to raise the debt ceiling"" in a mail flier forwarded March 10, 2014, to PolitiFact Texas by Matt Mackowiak, an adviser to his challenger in the May 27, 2014, primary runoff for the GOP nomination. Hall, who faces former U.S. Attorney John Ratcliffe, was elected to Congress in 1980 and has served 17 terms; he’s the oldest serving House member in history, as PolitiFact wrote March 20, 2014, in a fact-check rating False a charge that Hall was ""the oldest member in Congress ever."" Since 1980, there have been more than 50 votes to raise the debt ceiling, which caps how much the U.S. government can borrow to carry out everything budgeted by Congress. And during Hall’s tenure, the limit has never been reduced. But did Hall, who promises in a campaign ad that he ""won’t raise the debt ceiling, ever,"" never vote before to increase the cap? Debt ceiling votes tend to split on party lines. Typically, the party that controls the White House has had to push through the politically ticklish vote to raise the limit, while the other party gets a free run at criticizing the hike and voting against it. Memorably, Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., voted against raising the ceiling in 2006 when the Republican president, George W. Bush, sought an increase. Hall has been on both sides of that partisan divide, serving as a Democrat (albeit a conservative one) until Jan. 5, 2004, when he switched to the GOP.  Click here to visit the Washington Post’s interactive graphic on increases in the debt ceiling, updated Feb. 11, 2013 and spanning most of U.S. Rep. Ralph Hall’s time in Congress.   We called and emailed the Conservatives Acting Together PAC for information on its claim and didn’t hear back. Hall campaign spokesman Ed Valentine told us by phone that the campaign wasn’t involved with the mailer. Mackowiak told us by email that contrary to the PAC’s claim, Hall voted seven times to raise the ceiling from December 1985 through April 2005 -- twice under President Ronald Reagan, twice under President BIll Clinton and three times under Bush. Mackowiak’s breakdown almost entirely holds up, though we found that some of Hall’s votes for raising the ceiling were wrapped into other House decisions. According to the House clerk’s office and the Congressional Record, Hall voted five times in favor of raising the ceiling, though most of these instances were not pure votes on elevating the ceiling. Such increases were, for example, wrapped into the Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. In the other two cases Mackowiak cited, one each in 1985 and 2005, the ceiling-hike resolutions were passed by the House as a whole, rather than by individual representatives voting. This came about under the Gephardt rule, named after former Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., which operated on the premise that if representatives had voted for the budget, they had intended to fund everything in the budget, and it was thus not necessary to force them to take the potentially unpopular step of voting to raise the debt limit separately. In 2005, Hall voted for the House budget measure that triggered the debt limit hike. But in 1985, he voted against the original House version of the budget that was wrapped into the resolution the Senate approved -- so under the logic of the Gephardt rule, Hall presumably did not approve the debt limit increase that came with that budget. Hall votes: April 28, 2005, House Joint Resolution 47 deemed passed. Hall voted for the budget measure that triggered it. Nov. 18, 2004, vote for Senate Bill 2986. June 27, 2002, vote for Senate Bill 2578. July 30, 1997, vote for House Resolution 2015. March 28, 1996, vote for House Resolution 3136. Aug. 14, 1986, vote for House Resolution 5395. Dec. 11, 1985, House Joint Resolution 372 deemed passed. Hall voted against House Concurrent Resolution 152, which was wrapped into Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, the approval of which triggered HJR 372. Our ruling The PAC said, ""Ralph Hall has never voted to raise the debt ceiling."" We didn’t have to look further than the votes cited by his opponent’s campaign to find six instances from 1986 through 2005 in which Hall backed debt-limit increases. We rate this claim as False.

"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Jack Kingston']","
Kingston’s claim about number of uninsured has some merit
","Republicans have made the case on several different fronts why the federal health care law is not the cure for the nation’s health care problems, primarily from a policy perspective. Some are now using a numbers-based argument to contend it’s not helping as many Americans as the law’s supporters predicted. ""There are still more people uninsured today than when (Barack) Obama was elected president,"" U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, a Republican from Savannah, said recently on the Fox News Channel. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if the congressman’s claim is correct. Obama, a Democrat, took office in January 2009. A year later, he signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, arguably the most sweeping rule changes on health care since Medicare was created in the late 1960s. Many Republicans mockingly called the law ""Obamacare,"" a moniker that the president later said he would proudly embrace. Kingston, who is running this year for the U.S. Senate, voted against the health care law. Earlier this month, U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said ""there are less people today with health insurance than there were before this law went into effect."" Our friends at PolitiFact in Washington examined that claim and found many problems with Boehner’s statement and rated it False. Kingston’s claim is different, primarily because of the different time frame he used, so we continued with our research. Health care data is difficult to determine. The Obama administration started its insurance marketplace accounts for enrollees to join, but sign-ups initially fell well below Congressional Budget Office projections. An estimated 6 million people have now signed up for health care through the marketplaces set up through the law, but that number is uncertain because individuals can purchase insurance outside of the marketplaces in Vermont and Washington, D.C. The open enrollment season ends Monday. One consistent statistic we found in several surveys showed there were more than 40 million Americans without health insurance in 2008, the year before Obama moved into the White House. Kingston’s office said the congressman based his claim on a recent nationwide Gallup poll on America’s uninsured. The poll shows 15.4 percent of Americans were uninsured during the first quarter of 2009. Currently, 15.9 percent of Americans are uninsured. The poll has a margin of error of 1 percentage point. Does that mean there could now be a smaller percentage of Americans uninsured, or that the percentage is basically the same between those two years? ""Technically, you could say that they were within the margin, but that margin means the ‘09 number could be as low as 14.4 and the 2014 as high as 16.9 percent,"" Greg Dolan, a spokesman for Kingston, said in one email. The Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also tracks how many Americans are uninsured on an annual basis. Their data is similar to the Gallup poll. In 2008, they found 14.7 percent of Americans were uninsured at the time they were interviewed. In 2013, the number of uninsured was barely lower, at 14.6 percent. The 2013 survey was done between January and June. It’s unclear when the 2008 survey was conducted. In 2009, the CDC survey shows 15.4 percent were uninsured when they were interviewed. We also looked at data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which also releases annual statistics on the health insurance status of Americans. In 2008, 14.9 percent of Americans were uninsured. A year later, the percentage of uninsured rose to 16.1 percent. In 2012, it declined to 15.4 percent. The actual number of Americans uninsured, according to the Census Bureau data, rose from nearly 44.8 million in 2008 to nearly 49 million in 2009. In 2012, their data shows just under 48 million Americans were uninsured. The Census Bureau data does not indicate whether there is a margin of error. Obama did take office amid the nation’s worst financial situation since the Great Depression. The unemployment rate rose from 6.1 percent in September 2008 -- when the crisis began -- to 7.8 percent in January 2009, adding about 2.5 million Americans to the unemployment rolls, with many of them presumably losing their health insurance. The unemployment rate rose to 10 percent by October 2009. Should Obama get a reprieve from Kingston’s criticism because of the economic meltdown? No, Kingston’s office says. Dolan said the congressman’s point is that the health care law is not dramatically reducing the number of Americans without health insurance. The Gallup poll, however, shows the percentage of those uninsured has declined from 18 percent at one point late last year to the current uninsured rate of 15.9 percent. ""The numbers of uninsured skyrocketed in reaction to passage of Obamacare (in 2010),"" Dolan said. ""That they’ve settled out where they were before this disaster is not a positive sign for the initiative."" So where does this leave us? Kingston said in a television interview that ""there are still more people uninsured today than when Obama was elected president."" Obama came into office facing some extraordinary economic circumstances with several million Americans losing their jobs and many of them losing their health insurance. Some might say the president should get cut some slack here. Kingston’s camp says the problem worsened as a result of the health care law. The congressman based his claim on a Gallup poll detailing the percentage of uninsured between the beginning of 2009 and now. His office says the Census Bureau data we found showing more people uninsured in 2012 than in 2008 supports his argument. The percentage of Americans uninsured we reviewed in other polls and surveys mostly shows there has been a slight increase since 2008, although the numbers are close or within the margin of error. We rate Kingston’s claim Half True. PolitiFact’s definition of Half True is the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E0810C0>],/factchecks/2014/mar/31/jack-kingston/kingstons-claim-about-number-uninsured-has-some-me/
"['Economy', 'Income', 'Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Mary Burke']","
Mary Burke says wages are declining in Wisconsin at double the rate of other states
","At the center of Mary Burke’s economic critique of the Gov. Scott Walker era is the charge that Wisconsin’s recovery from the Great Recession has lagged behind other states. In her recently unveiled jobs plan, the Democratic candidate for governor marshalled statistics to make a case that progress on jobs and earnings has been lackluster or even nonexistent. One example: ""Wisconsin wages are declining at double the rate of other states, and current indicators suggest these trends will continue if we stay on the current path,"" according to Burke’s plan, which came out March 25, 2014. Are we really losing ground on wages that quickly? We started with the source cited in Burke’s plan: ""According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, private-sector wages in Wisconsin fell 2.2% in the 12 months ending September 2012, double the 1.1% decline experienced by the nation overall."" Those numbers were familiar to us. They were included in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story headlined ""American workers losing ground on wages."" That story ran May 26, 2013, citing the most-recent wage data published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. It showed Wisconsin wages were declining at double the rate of other states. But that was then, and this is now. Newer numbers Wage data for both the state and nation is volatile and fluctuates strongly when measured in increments of 12 months or one quarter. Since those September 2012 figures were released, the BLS has published four quarterly updates. Each update looks at one quarter and compares it with the same quarter a year earlier. (Data notes: There’s a reporting lag of about six months due to the time spent collecting and analyzing the data; the most recent available runs through September 2013. These are averages, so they point to a general trend.) It turns out Burke’s campaign plan selected the worst quarterly wages report during the Walker era and the end of the final term of Gov. Jim Doyle, who left office after 2010. The report she cited ranked Wisconsin at 47th among the states for percent change in average weekly wage (including bonuses) for the one-year period ending in September 2012 quarter. The average wage fell -- losing 2.2 percent in preliminary calculations and 2.3 percent in the final analysis. That was a reduction for workers of $18 a week. But that trend did not hold either in Wisconsin or nationally. Wisconsin’s private-sector wage growth has made a big move in the opposite direction, topping the national average starting with the March 2013 quarterly report. We found: -- For the quarter ending December 2012, the average weekly wage went up (4.9 percent), not down, compared with the same period a year earlier. That was tied for 18th best among the states, and only slightly trailed the national average wage increase. -- By March 2013, the average increase was 1.2 percent, three times better than the national average. -- By June 2013, the increase was 2.2 percent, slightly above the national average and tied for 19th. -- For the one-year period ending in the September 2013 quarter, the state’s wage growth was fifth best in the country, beating the national average (3.4 percent gain vs. 1.9 percent gain). The picture changes This latest report came out five days before the release of Burke’s economic plan. It shows Wisconsin’s wage growth in that period ahead of all adjoining Midwest states and behind only North Dakota, South Dakota, Louisiana and Nebraska nationally. Drilling down, average Wisconsin wages grew 2.8 percent in goods-producing jobs and 3.7 percent in service jobs. In sum, the 2013 picture on wage growth so far is much different than the one for 2012, but is omitted by Burke. Her jobs plan pointedly blames ""misguided"" Walker actions over three years for helping make Wisconsin’s recovery an outlier -- while examining only one quarterly report of wage data from 2012. We filled in that gap some more by looking at other quarterly wage reports that reflect wage trends in Walker’s first year, 2011. In those,  Wisconsin’s wage increase topped the national mark twice. In a third, average wages dropped both nationally and in Wisconsin (-1.6 percent and -2.2 percent, respectively). Burke’s campaign told us she meant to spotlight a long-term gap between Wisconsin and U.S. earnings growth trends. That gap exists, according to a Journal Sentinel story on March 25, 2014 that said, since 2009, Wisconsin's personal net earnings have rebounded after the recession but more slowly than the nation, based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. That data came out the same day Burke made her jobs plan public. Burke’s jobs plan does, we note, discuss job and wage trends in the context both of Walker and the years preceding his election. But her campaign pointed us to nothing that shows Wisconsin’s average wages have dropped over an extended period, much less at twice the rate of the mark in other states. Our rating Burke’s economic plan said that ""Wisconsin wages are declining at double the rate of other states."" That was the situation in one quarter ending in September 2012, but Wisconsin wages are not declining at all based on much more current data. Burke’s plan cherry-picked an outdated report that turned out to be an anomaly. More recent data that shows Wisconsin’s average wages not only growing but topping the national mark three quarters in a row. All this is easily accessed on federal websites and publicized in news releases issued by federal officials. We think that makes this claim not only false but ridiculous. Pants on Fire.

Rattner: Manufacturing wages today in America lower 'than average wages in the economy as a whole'
","Former ""car czar"" Steven Rattner, who actually hates the nickname he earned overseeing the auto bailout, is pushing back against proclamations of a flourishing American manufacturing industry. Again. Rattner wrote an eye-catching New York Times op-ed in January calling the industry’s post-recession jobs gains a trickle, arguing ""we need to get real about the so-called renaissance"" partly because wages for auto workers and manufacturers dropped far more than the average private-sector worker since the end of the recession in June 2009. He revisited some of those points in a March 30, 2014, appearance on ABC’s This Week, which took a break from coverage of Russia and the missing Malaysian plane to examine the state of ""Made in the USA."" ""We certainly want these kinds of advanced manufacturing jobs. But remember this, manufacturing wages today in America on a per-hour basis are actually a bit lower than average wages in the economy as a whole,"" he said. ""And what I mean by that is there are lots of really good high-paying jobs in sectors like education, like IT, like health care, service sectors that are not just entry-level jobs, they are really high-paying jobs, and this is our competitive advantage."" Manufacturing jobs are typically seen as a source of higher pay for people who don’t earn college degrees, and President Barack Obama put an emphasis on them in his State of the Union address. So PunditFact wondered if Rattner is right: Are per-hour wages in manufacturing a little smaller than average wages for the rest of the American economy? Rattner pointed to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees in the private sector, which make up about four-fifths of total private-sector employment. The most recent data for February 2014 shows the average hourly private-sector wage was $20.50. The manufacturing industry average was, as Rattner said, a bit lower at $19.43. Hourly wages are almost $3 higher for employees who produce durable goods, such as cars, phones and computers, than those who make nondurable goods, or things like food, gas and clothes. Weekly wages tell a different story, with manufacturers earning almost $122 more a week than the total worker average in February. The reason for the discrepancy between hourly and weekly wages is simple: Manufacturers work more hours. ""Anyone can work more hours and make more money,"" Rattner said. But manufacturers also earn more money an hour when you factor in supervisors. BLS data for February show average hourly earnings are $24.31 for all private-sector employees and $24.72 for manufacturing employees -- the opposite of what Rattner said. Which dataset is better? The question can incite an economists’ quarrel. Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the Center for Economic Policy Research, took issue with isolating a dataset that excludes supervisors, saying analysts see the distinction as arbitrary and are increasingly using the whole workforce for their research. The manufacturing industry has a lower percentage of production employees (70.1 percent) than the average for the private-sector workforce (82.7 percent), which accounts for the higher pay when using Rattner's measure, Baker said. Rattner argues viewing the data his way is more representative of the typical worker’s earnings without being influenced by the top of the pay scale. Another liberal economist and former Obama administration adviser, Jared Bernstein of the Center for Budget Policies and Priorities, faulted Rattner for excluding benefits on top of wages. Manufacturing workers often have benefits, he said. Another BLS source for wage data (yes, there are a lot of them) shows that when looking at total compensation (wages plus benefits), manufacturing workers earn $35.14 an hour, which is higher than the $28.44 average for careers in the service-providing industry and $29.63 for all private-sector workers in December 2013. ""Since it's widely believed that workers trade off benefit pay for lower wages, it's a mistake to just consider wages in this sort of comparison when you're dealing with an industry that pays benefits (as opposed to say, fast food),"" Bernstein said. Matthew Lavoie, National Association of Manufacturers spokesman, said 97 percent of the group’s 12,000 members provide health insurance. Rattner conceded manufacturers earn more than service-industry workers when benefits are included in his New York Times column. In our interview with Rattner, he anticipated these objections to his claim. ""But my point remains the same: The perception that manufacturing jobs are ‘better’ jobs is out of date,"" Rattner wrote. ""Note also that over the past year, per-hour wages for all industries rose by 50 cents per hour but in manufacturing, they rose by only 21 cents per hour. The trend is not manufacturing's friend, as my NYT piece pointed out."" Our ruling Rattner was careful on This Week to single out data for per-hour wages when he argued manufacturers are not paid as much as the rest of workforce. His claim relies on the most recent data for production workers in the manufacturing industry, who earn about $1 less than the average of their private-sector counterparts. However, factoring in supervisors shows manufacturers make 41 cents more per hour. Adding benefits gives manufacturers more of an edge. We won’t take sides and say what dataset we think is best. What we can say is that Rattner makes an accurate point by one measure. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E08C300>],/factchecks/2014/mar/30/steven-rattner/rattner-manufacturing-wages-today-america-lower-av/

Giuliani: 'No one' says bridge report that vindicates New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is conclusive
","The first in a series of investigations into a bridge-closing scandal surrounding Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and his office was released this week, providing plenty of fodder on the political future of the potential 2016 heavyweight on all five Sunday talk shows. Randy Mastro of the New York law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, unveiled a report March 26, 2014, that exonerated Christie of any wrongdoing and blamed a top aide of the governor and a senior official for the Port Authority for devising a scheme to close parts of the George Washington Bridge for a traffic study in September 2013. Reports have alleged the maneuver was political retribution against officials in Fort Lee, N.J., which was most impacted by the lane closures. Christie’s critics scoffed at Mastro’s report, noting that it was commissioned by the governor and paid for with New Jersey taxpayer dollars. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was asked on Meet the Press whether the findings closed the door on the scandal and vindicated Christie. Giuliani defended Mastro, a Democrat who worked for Giuliani's administration, as ""someone who took on the teamsters union and cleaned up New York from the mafia under threat of death several times."" Christie has ""a guy doing this report who’s not about to do a whitewash,"" Giuliani went on to say. ""I think this is a pretty strong report. It is not conclusive. No one claims it is, but it’s a good step in the right direction."" That’s a pretty measured assessment of the report and the reaction to it, and a lot different than what we heard from Mastro and Christie in interviews this week. The Mastro report According to the report, investigators had access to personal and private email accounts and phone records of Christie and his current and former staff members. They reviewed more than 250,000 documents and conducted 70 interviews. The findings were detailed in a 360-page document looking at both the bridge scandal and allegations Christie withheld Hurricane Sandy aid from a New Jersey town for political reasons. You can read the full report here. The authors are upfront that there is one big hole in their investigation: They were not able to interview Christie aide Bridget Kelly or Port Authority official David Wildstein. But that didn’t keep them from strong conclusions. ""Based on our investigation, we are now in a position to address most but not all of these allegations, as several key witnesses have refused to cooperate with our investigation or asserted their Fifth Amendment rights,"" the report said. The report concluded that those two individuals were at the center of the controversy, and the only major missing piece is understanding why they took such actions. ""We are therefore confident that, based on our thorough review, we have a clear understanding of what happened here, even if the participants’ precise motives remain to be determined,"" the report said. Later, in the conclusion, the report stated rather definitively: ""In sum, we have not found any evidence of anyone in the governor’s office knowing about the lane realignment beforehand or otherwise being involved, besides Bridget Kelly. Whatever motivated Wildstein and Kelly to act as they did, it was not at the behest of Gov. Christie, who knew nothing about it."" Christie and Mastro comment Christie took questions from reporters for more than an hour last week after the report was released, his first since the early days of the controversy. In his remarks, Christie called the report ""exhaustive"" in its breadth and the access investigators were allowed. He noted he even turned over his personal cell phone. ""It’s an exhaustive report that follows the mandate that I set out when I commissioned the review,"" Christie said. ""I told (Mastro) to go find the truth no matter where it led and to turn over every rock to get to the bottom of what happened and to let me know what the truth was."" Christie did acknowledge other pending reports, including from Democrats controlling the state legislature and from the Justice Department. But he expected similar results. ""The report will stand the test of time, but it will be tested by the other investigations that are ongoing,"" he said. He also reiterated that the report was limited in finding a motive, ""in small part by some of the access that they had and didn’t have to certain people, but in the end all of that is fronted in the report. It doesn’t claim to be anything other than what it is. But it is exhaustive, and it is thorough."" For his part, Mastro had strong language in backing up the report’s findings and on ABC This Week, Mastro didn’t hold back. ""I have to say this, for the skeptics out there, there are some who have a visceral reaction to this bridge controversy,"" he said. ""Reminds me of the (A Few Good Men) movie line, ‘They can't handle the truth.’ We believe we got to the truth."" But that came Sunday. Maybe Giuliani didn’t see the interview since he was shooting Meet the Press. What did Mastro have to say about the report earlier in the week? ""There is not a shred of evidence that Gov. Christie knew anything about this lane realignment decision before it happened,"" he told Fox News on March 27, 2014. ""Not a shred."" Our ruling Giuliani said ""no one"" called the Mastro report ""conclusive."" Perhaps no one used those exact words (though the report itself had a pretty strongly worded ""conclusion"" section). But one of the targets of the investigation, Christie, said it would ""stand the test of time"" and the main investigator stated bluntly there was ""not a shred of evidence"" that Christie is to blame. That sounds pretty conclusive to us. The broader point here, of course, is that critics of the report say the investigation is anything but conclusive, as it was ordered by Christie. In that regard, Giuliani was no doubt trying to tamp down any fires. But in doing so he ignored the claims of both Christie and Mastro. Christie and Mastro admit some blind spots exist in the report, but those relate mostly to understanding why Kelly and Wildstein closed the bridge, and not Christie.

Wisconsin among top 10 in losing residents to other states, Scott Walker challenger Mary Burke says
","Mary Burke’s 40-page jobs plan not only lays out what she would do as governor, it critiques the policies of Gov. Scott Walker, whom she hopes to defeat in the November 2014 election. ""Wisconsin needs government to work with business to train and educate tomorrow’s workers, to build the infrastructure and attract the capital necessary to grow business activity, and to make the investments in communities and quality-of-life that make businesses and workers alike want to call a place ‘home,’"" Burke wrote. ""We’re clearly not doing that now."" The plan, released March 25, 2014, then cites three statistics, including this one: ""Wisconsin now ranks among the top 10 states for out-migration."" We have had some rough winters. Are that many people leaving? A moving study In making the migration claim, the jobs report refers to the 2012 version of an annual study done by United Van Lines, the national moving company. Two problems here: -- The 2012 version isn’t the latest. -- United Van Lines tracks only household moves within the 48 contiguous states that are made by its customers. So, at best, the study is an indicator of state-to-state movement, and only by those who used one particular company. Yet Burke cites it as an authoritative document. In the mover's 2012 study, Wisconsin was among 10 states labeled ""high outbound"" -- meaning, 55 percent or more of the moves handled by United Van Lines in Wisconsin were for people leaving Wisconsin. But in the 2013 study, released nearly three months before Burke issued her jobs report, only nine states were labeled high outbound and Wisconsin was not one of them. Wisconsin was among 31 states labeled as ""balanced"" -- that is, the difference between the number of United Van Lines customers moving into and out of Wisconsin was negligible. So, Burke cites outdated data from a source that is not comprehensive. But outmigration is something that is tracked by the U.S. Census Bureau. Is it possible she’s still right? Census, tax data The Census Bureau counts state-to-state migration in two ways. Estimates based on census counts, tax returns and Medicare enrollment are cited by leading demographers such as William Frey of the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan policy research group, and Robert Scardamalia, former chief demographer for the State of New York. The latest one-year figures -- for July 1, 2012 to July 1, 2013 -- show Wisconsin ranked 12th in terms of states that suffered a net loss of residents to other states: State State-to-state net domestic migration 1. New York -104,470 2. Illinois - 67,313 3. California - 49,259 4. New Jersey - 45,035 5. Pennsylvania - 30,718 6. Michigan - 28,539 7. Ohio - 23,094 8. Connecticut -17,224 9. Kansas -12,557 10. New Mexico -10,526 11. Maryland - 8,525 12. Wisconsin - 8,158 (Expressed another way that accounts for differences in population among the states, Wisconsin ranks a little further from the top 10 -- 15th -- losing 1.4 people per 1,000 to state-to-state moves.) So, Burke’s top-10 claim is off, though not by much. Indeed, Wisconsin makes the top 10 if you consider a slightly longer period of time. Another set of the census- and tax return-based data covers April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2013 -- a period that includes the 10 months before Walker took office. For the longer period, Wisconsin ranked 10th, with a net loss of more than 28,000 people to other states. Survey data Another way the Census Bureau measures migration is through a survey in which residents are asked whether they lived in the same residence one year ago. Joseph Henchman of the Tax Foundation, which tracks out-migration, favors the survey data. The latest survey data indicate that Wisconsin actually posted positive net migration from 2011 to 2012. The estimate is 99,192 people moved into Wisconsin and 97,724 moved out, for a net gain of 1,468. However, like other surveys, this one has a margin of error. In this case, the margin of error means that Wisconsin could have actually posted a slightly larger net gain, or even a small net loss. Regardless, the survey figures don't support Burke’s claim. Our rating Burke said: ""Wisconsin now ranks among the top 10 states for out-migration."" Her statement contains an element of truth. In one census estimate, Wisconsin ranked 10th in terms of a net loss of residents from state-to-state migration from roughly 2010 to 2013. But the latest one-year census estimate shows Wisconsin ranked 12th in raw numbers, 15th on a percentage basis. Also, a one-year measure based on a census survey indicates Wisconsin actually gained more residents than it lost through people moving from one state to another. Given that Burke’s claim emphasized where Wisconsin ranks now, it goes too far. We rate it Mostly False.

Marijuana legalization opponent Heidi Heilman says today's marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent stronger than in the past
","Editors note: This item was revised on April 1, 2014 to reflect the fact that increases of 300 and 800 percent represent four- and nine-fold increases respectively. The ruling remains the same. In the debate over whether marijuana should be legalized, one issue is the question of potency. Critics of legalization argue that the street drug now available for sale is not the marijuana that a lot of baby boomers and Generation Xers have used. One of them, Heidi Heilman, director of New England field development for Smart Approaches to Marijuana and president of the Massachusetts Prevention Alliance, raised the issue March 13 in a commentary in The Providence Journal. ""Today’s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear,"" she wrote. ""Such dangerous levels of THC heighten mental illness and addiction risks for those who smoke marijuana — especially for kids with developing brains."" THC or tetrahydrocannabinol, available by prescription, is the key active ingredient in marijuana. It's well established that the potency of marijuana has increased over time. On Jan. 24, PolitiFact national ruled that when former Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy said that marijuana today is ""genetically modified,"" with THC levels that ""far surpass the marijuana"" of the 1970s, his statement was Mostly True. Heilman was being more specific. Because something 100 percent more potent is actually twice as potent, she was saying that the potency of today's marijuana is now four to nine times greater than ""yesteryear,"" a rather vague starting point. Nonetheless, we wanted to see if her statement was on target or her statistic was a bit high. Heilman was quick to send us several pieces of information. The first was a graph showing a rapid increase in potency from 1960 to 2011, a 52-year span. It shows the ratio of THC in marijuana going from 0.2 percent to 11.4 percent. That's an increase of 5,700 percent, well outside the range cited by Heilman. But are those numbers reliable? The graph says the information came from a study in the Journal of Forensic Science. But that study was published in 2010, and only covered a 16-year period that ends in 2008. Its authors, researchers at the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi, examined 46,000 samples of marijuana seized during law enforcement raids. They found that the THC concentrations of marijuana had risen by about 171 percent in that time period, well below the 300 to 800 percent increase cited by Heilman. We also contacted the Drug Enforcement Administration in Boston and Washington and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. They referred us back to the research center at Ole Miss, which has been monitoring THC content at least since the early 1970s. The researchers there sent us copies of their reports, all published in the journal, along with test results that included the most recent data. We also secured some of their quarterly reports. We found that even though the report Heilman cited didn’t back up her claim, the Ole Miss data did. YEAR Tested % THC YEAR Tested % THC YEAR Tested % THC 1972 34 0.18 1986 1370 2.36 2000 3148 4.92 1973 33 0.22 1987 1550 2.96 2001 2716 5.36 1974 114 0.36 1988 1640 3.18 2002 2413 6.4 1975 149 0.48 1989 1075 3.04 2003 2517 6.31 1976 209 0.98 1990 1108 3.24 2004 2637 7.24 1977 251 1.76 1991 2148 3.09 2005 3004 7.24 1978 130 1.73 1992 3336 3.08 2006 2891 7.76 1979 220 1.53 1993 3031 3.38 2007 3114 8.74 1980 151 2.15 1994 3024 3.50 2008 2775 8.89 1981 249 2.11 1995 4792 3.77 2009 3079 8.34 1982 435 3.07 1996 2451 4.09 2010 2720 10.7 1983 1145 3.30 1997 2496 4.64 2011 2342 11.13 1984 1030 3.31 1998 2283 4.47 2012 2055 12.3 1985 1449 2.83 1999 2692 4.6         In 2012, the most recent year in which testing has been completed, the average THC concentration was 12.3 percent. That would be 300 percent higher (or four times stronger) than 1992 levels, when the average was 3.08 percent. And it would be 800 percent higher (or nine times stronger) than the average level of 0.98 percent found in 1976. How high could the THC content potentially go? One specimen, seized on Sept. 11, 2007, was found to have a THC content of 37.2 percent. Our ruling  Heidi Heilman said, ""Today’s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear."" Long-term testing shows that, on average, today's marijuana is three times more potent than pre-1993 marijuana and eight times more potent than grass seized in 1976 and earlier. We rate her claim as True.

McAuliffe says Medicaid expansion will save Virginia $1 billion
","Gov. Terry McAuliffe says expanding the state’s Medicaid program would allow Virginia to save money by offering health coverage to 400,000 poor and disabled citizens. ""PriceWaterhouse just did an analysis,"" McAuliffe said on Feb. 26 during his monthly radio show  on WTOP in Washington. ""We will save our state treasury $1 billion over the next eight years. So we can provide coverage and we can save our treasury over $1 billion, which we then can invest in pre-K and other top priorities."" The potential savings is a key issue as the General Assembly struggles this spring to decide whether to expand Medicaid eligibility -- a stalemated debate that is blocking passage of a two-year state budget. House Republicans staunchly oppose the enlargement, saying the federal government can’t be trusted to keep its Obamacare promise to pick up the full tab for the added enrollees over the next three years and pay 90 percent of the cost down the road. They’ve accused McAuliffe, a Democrat, of overstating the possible savings. We asked the governor’s office for proof of the $1 billion in savings, a claim McAuliffe has made repeatedly. Spokesman Brian Coy sent a Jan. 23 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch saying Medicaid expansion ""would produce savings of $1 billion through 2022."" So we turned to the original source: PricewaterhouseCoopers’ analysis, which was presented to General Assembly members in late January. The study looked at the fiscal effect that the entire Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, would have on the Virginia’s Medicaid program. It concluded that the law offers Virginia $1.021 billion in savings through mid 2022. But the charts show that Virginia will save $420 million of that sum regardless of whether it expands Medicaid. The savings will largely come from two other parts of Obamacare: increased federal funding to provide health coverage to low income children and higher than expected rebates from drug manufacturers to defray the state’s cost of Medicaid prescriptions. Virginia still stands to save a significant chunk of money by broadening eligibility for Medicaid, but not as much as the governor said. If the expansion began on July 1, the analysis says Virginia would save $601 million through mid-2022. The main reason is that the state would no longer need to pay hospitals and clinics for their losses from treating indigent patients -- adults who can’t afford private insurance but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. The expansion would make Medicaid to available to people earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line, or $15,521 in a one-person household and $20,921 in a two-person household. Virginia’s currently has three income thresholds for Medicaid eligibility based on where in the state a person lives. The average cutoff for adults is household income exceeding 32.7 percent of the federal poverty line, according to the Department of Medical Assistance Services, which runs Virginia’s Medicaid Program. That breaks down to annual earnings of about $3,846 for a one-person household and $5,144 for a two-person household. The Medicaid cutoff for pregnant women in Virginia is 143 percent of the poverty line, or about $16,817. Our ruling McAuliffe says Virginia will save $1 billion if the General Assembly expands eligibility for MedicaId. But the analysis he cites says the state will save $420 million of that sum, regardless of whether it broadens Medicare, from other provisions in Obamacare. The research concludes that $601 million in savings over the next eight years are riding on the legislature's decision. So McAuliffe is right that there’s a lot of expansion money on the table, but he exaggerates how much. We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E395200>],/factchecks/2014/mar/30/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-medicaid-expansion-will-save-virgin/

No, gas in Canada isn’t $9 per gallon
","As Americans face record-high gasoline prices hovering around $5 per gallon, many other nations have experienced even steeper costs at the pump.  But despite what several Instagram posts have claimed, gas in Canada did not skyrocket to as much as $9 per gallon at the start of summer. The claim about the United States’ northern neighbor took off on Twitter June 11. ""Gas in Canada is $9.00 a gallon,"" the tweet said. ""It’s not (President Joe) Biden’s issue."" The viral tweet spread in the following days to Instagram, where a pair of posts shared screenshots of the tweet over photos of Biden. Those posts racked up more than 15,000 interactions, according to data from CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. ""This tweet is going viral on Twitter. Do you blame Biden for the gas prices?"" said the first of the two posts, which was uploaded June 17. ""Do y’all blame Biden for the gas prices or nah?"" the second post said June 20.  The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) U.S. federal data show that for the week beginning June 13, the average weekly national gasoline price was about $5.01 per gallon. On June 22, the national average was at roughly $4.96 per gallon, according to the American Automobile Association.   Although the average price at the pump in Canada is higher than in the U.S., it is not as high as $9 per gallon — no matter if you measure it in U.S. or Canadian dollars. According to the Canadian Automobile Association, the average gas price in Canada as of June 22 rounds to about $2.02 in Canadian dollars per liter, or about CA$7.66 per gallon. Factoring in the currency exchange rate, that translates to about $5.89 per gallon.   There are approximately 3.79 liters in one gallon, and $1 is worth about CA$1.30. Organizations that track gas prices across countries, such as GasPetrolPrices.com, have also put the average price in Canada far below $9 per gallon. The website’s most recent calculations, for June 20, show the lowest average gas price was in Venezuela, at about 8 cents per gallon. The highest price at that time was in Hong Kong, at more than $11 per gallon. Canadian gas prices weren’t near $9 per gallon around the time of the original June 11 tweet either, Snopes reported. Factors such as taxes on gas, how reliant countries are on cars for transportation, and whether those countries produce their own oil play a role in cost fluctuations from one nation to the next. Gas prices across the globe have also surged because of sanctions on Russian energy, pandemic-related changes in supply and demand, and increasing oil costs.

Yes, Wisconsin’s abortion law is older than 20 U.S. states
","With a U.S. Supreme Court ruling near, which could overturn or substantially modify the decades-old Roe vs. Wade decision, abortion is a top of mind issue for many. At the center of the debate in Wisconsin is a 173-year-old law – one that nearly dates to the state’s inception — that, if Roe is overturned, would criminalize abortion except in cases where it is necessary to save the mother’s life.  The re-election campaign for Gov. Tony Evers used a novel way to compare how old the law is in a June 13, 2022, email to supporters. Evers, a Democrat, is an abortion-rights supporter. On June 8, 2022, he called the Republican-controlled Legislature into session to address the old law, but GOP leaders met only briefly on June 22, 2022, and took no action. Republican lawmakers who control the state Legislature on June 22, 2022, rejected a special legislative session called by Evers to overturn the 1849 law that would outlaw abortion in the state except when necessary to save the life of the mother.    ""Wisconsin's archaic abortion ban is older than 20 states,"" senior press secretary Kayla Anderson said in the message.  That caught our attention, so we thought others may be interested in it, too. Twenty states joined the union after 1849  When we reached out to Anderson, she sent us a link to the list of states’ dates of admission to the union from Encyclopedia Britannica.  Wisconsin became a state in May 1948, the year before its abortion law was passed.  Here is the full list of states granted statehood after the 1849 Wisconsin law:  California, September 1850 Minnesota, May 1858 Oregon, February 1859 Kansas, January 1861 West Virginia, June 1863 Nevada, October 1864 Neraska, March 1867 Colorado, August 1876 North Dakota, November 1889 South Dakota, November 1889 Montana, November 1889 Washington, November 1889 Idaho, July 1890 Wyoming, July 1890 Utah, January 1896 Oklahoma, November 1907 New Mexico, January 1912 Arizona, February 1912 Alaska, January 1959  Hawaii, August 1959  That does tally 20. Evers’ campaign said that Wisconsin’s abortion law, which would go into effect were Roe v.

 Fact-checking Joe Biden on inflation rates among US’s economic peers
","When President Joe Biden sat down for an interview with the Associated Press, it was inevitable that the nation’s 40-year-high levels of inflation would come up. During the interview, Biden said his policies are not to blame. Instead, he pointed to global conditions to show that the United States is not alone in facing such challenges as high oil prices, lagging supply chains during the pandemic, and disruptions from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. Biden said, ""First of all, (a recession is) not inevitable. Secondly, we’re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation. It’s bad. Isn’t it kind of interesting? If it’s my fault, why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher? You ask yourself that? I’m not being a wise guy."" A reader noticed this statement and asked us to fact-check it. The statement can be read two ways. Is Biden (as the reader understood it) saying that every other ""major industrial country"" has a higher inflation rate than the U.S. does right now? Or is Biden saying that every other major industrial country has higher inflation than they normally do? The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. But we’ll look at both interpretations. The accuracy of his statement depends on how his words are interpreted. If this is what Biden meant, he would be wrong. We turned to data collected by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of advanced industrialized nations.  Looking at the most recent monthly inflation numbers, more than a dozen OECD members had a higher inflation rate than the United States’ 8.6%. These were predominantly Baltic and Eastern European nations, which have been hit especially hard by the consequences of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. But a larger number of OECD members had inflation rates lower than 8.6%, and these include all but one member of the G-7 group, which is limited to the world’s very largest democratic economies. Among the G-7 nations, Germany’s most recent inflation rate was 7.9%, the United Kingdom’s was 7.8%, Italy’s and Canada’s were 6.8%, and France’s was 5.2%. (The final G-7 member, Japan, hasn’t released current inflation numbers.) So the United States has a higher inflation rate currently than its closest economic peers do.   If this is what Biden meant, he would be right. In the six G-7 nations for which current inflation data is available — including the United States — pre-pandemic inflation rates hovered around 1% or 2%, rather than the 5% to 9% being seen now.   Some analysts would suggest that these two observations are consistent. They say that Biden’s coronavirus relief bill — the American Rescue Plan, which passed shortly after he took office in 2021 — drove inflation higher in the United States than it did in the other countries, which had no equivalent fiscal stimulus of that scale that late in the pandemic. ""The Biden administration and its allies in Congress provided entirely too much stimulus into an economy that was already dealing with supply shortages,"" said Michael Faulkender, a professor of finance at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business. ""This is necessarily inflationary and was totally predictable."" That said, the U.S. may have benefited in other ways from its expansionary monetary and fiscal policy during the pandemic compared to other rich countries, said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless. The U.S. may have ""obtained some advantage from those expansionary policies in terms of faster real economic growth"" than its rivals, Burtless said. The downside, he added, is that these policies also seem to have produced the disadvantage of higher inflation. Biden said, ""In every other major industrial country in the world … inflation is higher."" He’s right in one sense but wrong in another. Every other major industrialized nation has seen inflation spike well above pre-inflation levels. But the United States has seen its inflation rate spike higher than its most direct competitors.

""Chemtrails"" are not real, according to atmospheric chemists and geochemists, but conspiracy theorists have used the term to describe the condensation trails that airplanes create, suggesting that they show planes are spraying the earth with chemicals. In fact, these plumes are formed by the combination of high humidity and low temperatures. Nor is there evidence that the cattle deaths were orchestrated to cause a food shortage. Claims that heat is not to blame are also wrong. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment has said that at least 2,000 cattle died due to high temperatures and humidity, Reuters reported. The death toll was based on requests the state agency received to help dispose of the cow carcasses.  Scarlett Hagins, a Kansas Livestock Association spokesperson, told the news outlet that cattle started to suffer heat stress as temperatures soared from the high 70s to 108 degrees, humidity spiked and winds calmed. The cows couldn’t acclimate to the sudden change; the overnight temperatures did not enable them the time their bodies needed to cool down. Dr. Nels Lindberg, a veterinarian who works with feedlots in Kansas, told a CBS News affiliate in the state that the cattle deaths are the result of a natural disaster.  ""Sometimes the conditions get so extreme, it doesn’t matter how hard producers prepare the environment, the operation, the animals,"" Lindberg said.  We rate these posts False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54D948600>],/factchecks/2022/jun/21/facebook-posts/extreme-heat-killed-cattle-not-chemtrails-or-food-/

Wisconsin GOP state Sen. Wanggaard off-base with claim about suicide prevention, gun waiting periods
","Editor’s note: If you or someone you know is dealing with suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at (800) 273-8255 or text ""Hopeline"" to the National Crisis Text Line at 741-741. The mass shooting at an Uvalde, Texas, elementary school in late May — the second-deadliest school shooting in the nation’s history — has resurfaced arguments for stricter gun laws in the Wisconsin Legislature.  For years, Democrats have pushed to tighten restrictions around firearm purchases, such as expanding background checks to private sales and enacting red flag laws (which allow police or family members to petition a court to remove firearms from anyone deemed dangerous to themselves or others). Republicans who control the Legislature have largely resisted such measures, and after Uvalde, advocated for beefing up school security.    From the mid-1970s through 2015, Wisconsin had another type of gun law on the books: one that prohibited a handgun-buyer from taking possession of the gun until 48 hours after the background check had been started.  State Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine, introduced a 2015 bill — which was approved — that instead allows buyers to take possession of the gun immediately after they clear a background check.  In a June 5, 2022 appearance on Capital City Sunday, Wanggaard was asked if that 48-hour waiting period should be reinstated. His response: ""Absolutely not.""  ""I don’t know that that saves anything,"" Wanggaard said of the waiting period. ""If somebody’s decided that they’re going to take their life, they’re going to take their life.""  The senator’s remark is off-base. While research on the effectiveness of 48-hour waiting periods on reducing overall violence is mixed, studies show it can reduce suicide deaths in particular. Furthermore, experts say many suicide deaths are preventable.  Let’s take a look.  When asked for evidence to back up Wanggaard’s claim, a spokesperson from his office wrote that the remark was based on his three decades as a police officer and the experiences of several people he knew who died by suicide.  Because early intervention with potentially suicidal people has shown effectiveness, the spokesperson wrote, Wanggaard also believes if a person thinks someone they know may be thinking of suicide, they should reach out and get that person help.  Wanggaard’s staff cited a June 2005 study referenced in a more recent report from the medical journal BMC Psychiatry about the likelihood of a person who had attempted suicide trying to do so again.  But the study’s results disprove Wanggaard’s claim that a person who decides they want to die by suicide will do so — in the five years following a previous attempt, 37% made at least one more attempt that did not result in death, and just 6.7% did die by suicide. That means that the majority of the people in that study had at one point decided they were going to take their own life and ultimately did not.  Suicide is widely recognized as preventable. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it can be prevented through better treatment for people at risk of suicide, crisis intervention, stronger supports for mental health and financial stability and reduction of access to lethal means for people at risk of suicide, among others.  In a 2008 report about guns and suicide, David Hemenway, director of Harvard University’s Injury Control Research Center, wrote that studies show that ""most attempters act on impulse, in moments of panic or despair. Once the acute feelings ease, 90% do not go on to die by suicide.""  Wanggaard’s spokesperson also sent a July 3, 2017 Reuters article about a study from the Annals of Internal Medicine where the lead researcher had written that ""few"" suicide deaths could be prevented by limiting firearm access for those with a substance abuse disorder, mental health condition or a history of suicide attempts.  But the study isn’t saying that limiting firearm access won’t reduce suicide deaths. It’s saying that limiting access for that specific group of people won’t reduce them by much — and the researchers actually argue that those confines are too narrow.  ""We suggest that prevention of firearm suicide should be expanded beyond the current focus on these patients to include other persons at risk for suicide,"" the study says.  It’s worth noting that it also calls for expanding attention to suicide prevention measures beyond an exclusive focus on firearms to include other common means of suicide.  Evidence about whether 48-hour waiting periods on gun purchases can reduce overall violence is mixed, as laid out in a Feb. 2, 2022 fact-check from PolitiFact Wisconsin examining a state Democratic lawmaker’s claim about a similar issue.  But recent studies have found a correlation between waiting periods and a reduction in suicide deaths specifically, University of Wisconsin-Madison professor John Gross told us.  A March 2, 2018 analysis of previous studies of the relationship between waiting periods and suicides from the RAND Corporation found moderate evidence that waiting periods reduce suicides by firearm, and limited evidence that they reduce overall suicide deaths.  And a March 24, 2018 fact-check of Doug Jones, a Democrat and then-U.S. senator from Alabama, found the same: PolitiFact National rated Mostly True his claim that states that have implemented such waiting periods have seen significant decreases in suicides. Some professors said more research and different modeling may be necessary to make a final determination. When asked whether Wisconsin should reinstate the 48-hour waiting period for handgun purchases, Wanggaard said no because he doesn’t know ""that that saves anything,"" and ""if somebody’s decided that they’re going to take their life, they’re going to take their life."" But research shows a link between waiting periods and reduced suicide deaths, especially suicides by firearm.  Separately, evidence suggests that the majority of people who at one point sought to die by suicide do not do so.  We rate his claim False.   ",[<zip object at 0x000001A54EC12EC0>],/factchecks/2022/jun/21/van-wanggaard/wisconsin-gop-state-sen-wanggaard-base-claim-about/

High electricity costs tied to price of natural gas, not Green New Deal
","Temperatures in Texas are rising amid a June heatwave, testing the state's power grid and driving up demand for electricity. In a June 4 tweet, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Texans can blame their higher electric bills on supporters of the Green New Deal, a-yet-to-be-passed congressional plan touted as a strategy for tackling climate change. ""The impact of President Biden being beholden to the Green New Deal radicals in his party has electricity costs through the roof in Texas,"" Cruz wrote in his tweet. He included a link to a Dallas Morning News article that tied electricity costs to the price of natural gas, which has been on the rise. Texas accounts for 15% of the U.S. total natural gas consumption and is the country's top natural gas consumer, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration under the Department of Energy. In 2020, the amount of natural gas used for electricity generation was greatest in Texas compared to other states. So, what (or who) exactly is to blame for sky-high electric bills? Cruz says the progressives who champion measures to reduce the impact of climate change are at fault, but energy experts say Russia's war on Ukraine is driving up the cost of natural gas, which in turn impacts electricity costs. Let's explore. Michael Webber, a University of Texas professor with research specializing in clean energy technology, said the article Cruz tweeted undercuts his claim, because it attributes rising electricity costs to the price of natural gas, with no mention of the Green New Deal. Webber said the Green New Deal has not passed, so it has no influence over the current energy situation. The measure calls for the federal government to take steps to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Webber, who responded to Cruz's tweet online, called Cruz's claim ""fundamentally flawed."" But Steve Guest, a Cruz spokesperson, said in an email that Cruz's tweet ""is completely accurate."" Guest said that Biden's campaign website touts his support for the Green New Deal as ""a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.""  Guest pointed to campaign trail and debate stage promises Biden made that aligned with a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Biden paused new oil and gas leases on federal lands, but the pause on new leasing did not impact current oil and gas production. In April, the Biden administration announced that it would resume selling leases for drilling on public lands — with some limitations on the number of acres available and an increase in fees companies must pay to drill. Carey King, assistant director at the University of Texas Energy Institute, said North America has been shipping more natural gas abroad over the last few decades. With the U.S. and North America more interconnected in that global trade, natural gas prices in Europe and Asia affect prices more in the U.S. Europe is seeking to import natural gas from countries other than Russia due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Europe is paying more money for natural gas, including liquefied natural gas from the United States. ""And if LNG (liquefied natural gas) exporters in the United States can charge a higher price to sell to Europe, then they will,"" King said. ""Because they're buying at a higher price, that affects the price of gas throughout the continent."" U.S. exporters shipping more to Europe for a higher price puts pressure on natural gas prices in North America, King said. U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to Europe increased this year, according to the Energy Information Administration. The U.S. exported 74% of its liquefied natural gas to Europe through April this year compared to the annual average of 34% in 2021. At the same time, exports to Asia decreased through April. While investors could invest in more natural gas infrastructure for production and export, King said, that could take multiple years — and it's not certain whether natural gas demand from Europe will remain at higher levels. Cruz tweeted, ""The impact of President Biden being beholden to the Green New Deal radicals in his party has electricity costs through the roof in Texas.""  However, Green New Deal legislation has not passed. Rising electricity costs are tied to natural gas prices, which in turn are impacted by European nations turning away from Russia as a major supplier of natural gas.

Blaming one legislator for accident ignores a lot
","It took just one week for the first attack ad to appear in Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District campaign between incumbent U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne and state Sen. Zach Nunn, the Republican nominee challenging her.  On June 14, 2022, a week after Nunn won the Republican primary to oppose the two-term Democrat, Axne’s campaign released a video ad that begins with news reports about a fatal amusement park ride accident on July 3, 2021. Michael Jaramillo, 11, of Marion, Iowa, died after being trapped underwater at Adventureland Park. The park is in Altoona, Iowa. The ad’s narrator says: ""A tragedy that could have been avoided. But Zach Nunn took money from Adventureland’s CEO, then sponsored legislation to loosen amusement park safety rules.  ""A child died. Zach Nunn put his big donor first, ahead of the safety of Iowa families."" Unfair and inaccurate, Nunn responded. ""Beyond the heinous exploitation of a family’s tragic loss, the ad is false on several points,"" he said to PolitiFact Iowa in a text. Jaramillo did not die because of the legislation, Nunn said.  His campaign also issued a statement that said in part, ""Nunn and bipartisan legislators passed the law to improve workforce opportunities across Iowa, delivering Iowa as one of the lowest unemployment states in the country."" News reports show the amusement park industry nationwide was struggling post-COVID to find workers in 2021. Axne’s communications chief, Paige Godden, defended the ad’s message.  ""The park had a lengthy history of safety violations and dangerous conditions that resulted in injury to guests and workers, but when it lobbied for loosened safety regulations, Zach Nunn went ahead and sponsored that legislation,"" Godden wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa. ""Nunn took money from then-Adventureland executives and did their bidding.""  The legislation in question was House File 558, which lowered the minimum age for amusement park ride operators from 18 to 16, subject to carnival ride and safety training. Reps. Ras Smith, D-Waterloo; Brian Lohse, R-Bondurant; Megan Jones, R-Sioux Rapids; and John Wills, R-Spirit Lake, co-sponsored the bill. Nunn, Smith, Lohse and Wills represent counties that have amusement parks and Jones’ district covers the southern part of the Lake Okoboji region that includes one. Nunn introduced a companion bill in the Senate but it was dropped in favor of the House bill, which Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law April 30, 2021. The House bill passed the Senate with a bipartisan 29-to-15 vote after the House approved it by a 76-to-17 vote. The House vote was also bipartisan.  Nunn, an Air Force aircrew intelligence officer, was absent when the Senate voted because he was on an active military deployment, he said. Democrats voting for the law, Nunn’s campaign accurately pointed out, included the state party’s chairman, Rep. Ross Wilburn, and House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst. Asked about the Democratic votes, Godden wrote: ""Cindy Axne is not responsible for the votes of individual state senators or House members, and cannot speak to how they voted for this legislation.""  Adventureland Park is located in suburban Des Moines. State Labor Division amusement ride investigators found 17 safety violations on July 6, 2021, at the park’s Raging River ride, where the accident occurred. Michael Jaramillo’s brother, David Jaramillo spent time in a coma as he recovered; he was 15 when the accident happened. The boys’ father, also named David Jaramillo, was also injured in the accident. The ride did not reopen this year. Former Adventureland CEO and co-owner Michael Krantz, of Des Moines, gave Nunn’s campaign for the Legislature two $2,500 donations — one in 2018 and one in 2020 — for a total of $5,000, Iowa campaign finance disclosure records show. He gave Nunn’s 3rd Congressional District campaign $11,100 in August 2021, Federal Election Commission records show. Krantz family members, who sold the amusement park at the end of 2021, collectively have donated about $34,000 to Nunn’s congressional campaign, the Des Moines Register reported. Nunn, who lives in Bondurant, outside of Des Moines, said he has known the Krantz family since the age of 14 and that Krantz was the owner of a business in his state legislative district. ""Axne makes the verifiable false accusation in the attack ad that the legislation resulted in putting donors before families and the end result of the legislation caused the death of a child – verifiably incorrect,"" he wrote in his text to PolitiFact Iowa.

Operators at the Raging River ride when the July 2021 accident happened were older than 18. But the ride had been the site of another death, of a 68-year-old ride operator who fell in 2016. The park closed the Raging River ride in 2020 to replace a control board in an effort to prevent such an accident from happening again, a park attorney told the Des Moines Register. The Axne for Congress ad said, ""A tragedy that could have been avoided. But Zach Nunn took money from Adventureland’s CEO, then sponsored legislation to loosen amusement park safety rules. A child died. Zach Nunn put his big donor first, ahead of the safety of Iowa families."" Nunn sponsored a bill in the Iowa Senate that was the counterpart of one that became law in 2021. The law reduced the minimum age for running an amusement park ride in Iowa from 18 to 16. In addition, he has accepted $34,000 in campaign donations collectively from the family that owned the park at the time. However, the ad oversteps when it suggests that the Adventureland death could have been avoided if the law hadn’t passed. The operators of the ride that led to the teenager’s death were older than 18.

The Pants on Fire claim that communists have controlled U.S. institutions for decades
","During a recent interview with Fox News, Monica Crowley, a conservative commentator and longtime foreign policy specialist, made a bold claim: Overseas communists have controlled key institutions of American life for decades. Crowley, who served as assistant secretary for public affairs at the Treasury Department during the Trump administration, was interviewed on the June 12 edition of the weekly Fox News show ""The Next Revolution With Steve Hilton.""  Guest on Fox claims the President is intentionally destroying the US and says it began as a KGB operation in the 1930’s pic.twitter.com/1azWQMrOCR In the interview, she accused President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party of running the United States into the ground on purpose. She said such America-destroying efforts by liberals are part and parcel of a longstanding plan hatched by the Soviet Union in the 1930s. Crowley began by saying, ""It’s tough for most Americans to understand that their president and a whole major political party in the U.S. is intentionally destroying and crippling the United States. But that’s exactly what is happening here. And unless and until we understand that, we’re not going to be able to counter it in an effective way."" Hilton expressed agreement with Crowley’s analysis, then asked her where Democrats’ desire to hurt the country has come from. Crowley responded: ""This has been a long-term project by the left. It actually began in the 1930s, and it came out of the KGB (the former Russian secret police agency). It was a KGB operation to destroy the country. And then after World War II, the Soviets actually changed their tactics. And what they decided to do, and it’s been very effective for many decades, is infiltrate and grab control of the major pillars of U.S. life. They grabbed control of the culture — so entertainment, movies, television, music. They grabbed control of academia, at the university level and now it’s all the way shot down through kindergarten and even younger. And they grabbed control of the news media.  ""With those pillars, they have been able to inflict tremendous damage over many decades. And now we are at a tipping point where the useful idiots on the left -- the Soviet Union collapsed, the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) stepped in to take over this grand project to destroy the country from within -- that’s exactly what’s happening. And now when you have useful idiots in the highest levels of power, including in the White House, including in Congress, you’re seeing an acceleration of the tipping point, to the point where we’re almost at the point of no return."" We interviewed more than a dozen experts in the history of communist influence in the United States and they offered a unanimous answer: While the Soviet Union did seek to control major pillars of the United States, and while the USSR chalked up a few scattered successes decades ago in attracting support in the U.S., Crowley is flat-out wrong to say the USSR or China has ever controlled entertainment, education, or media, much less that they are doing so today. Multiple experts told PolitiFact that Crowley is rehashing arguments spread since the 1950s by the John Birch Society and other groups. If anything, they said her exaggeration of widespread overseas communist control of U.S. institutions is more extreme and less accurate. ""The claim that Soviet and Chinese communists ever controlled or now control (such institutions) is nonsense,"" said Harvey Klehr, a retired Emory University historian whose books include ""The Soviet World of American Communism"" and ""In Denial: Historians, Communism and Espionage."" Klehr is an adviser to the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. Kevin Boyle, a Northwestern University historian and author of ""The Shattering: America in the 1960s,"" agreed. ""Soviet and Chinese communist governments – or any communist governments – never controlled American education, entertainment, or the media. To claim that was ever the case is not only false but absolutely ludicrous."" Asked about Crowley’s theory, Andrew Hartman, a historian at Illinois State University and author of ""A War for the Soul of America: A History of the Culture Wars,"" offered ""a resounding no. It’s absurd and doesn’t really merit serious discussion."" Attempts to reach Crowley through social media and through the Richard Nixon Foundation, where she is on the board of directors, were unsuccessful. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, R-Wis., displays a file to reporters on July 25, 1950, after declaring on the Senate floor that an ""important"" State Department official is a communist. (AP) Experts were careful to distinguish between nefarious things that communists did accomplish in the U.S. and the notion that they ever controlled key American institutions. For instance, both the USSR and communist China used spies against the United States. ""Soviet spies did penetrate the atomic bomb project, and Alger Hiss (who was accused of spying for the Soviet Union) was at State Department,"" said William I. Hitchcock, a University of Virginia historian and author of ""The Age of Eisenhower: America and the World in the 1950s."" The USSR also exerted influence over the (relatively small) Communist Party of the USA, said Jon Shelton, a University of Wisconsin-Green Bay professor and author of ""Teacher Strike!: Public Education and the Making of a New American Political Order."" The highest-profile battles involved Hollywood. In the 1930s and 1940s, ""there were Communist Party USA members and sympathizers who were writers, directors, and actors,"" said Victor Devinatz, a labor historian at Illinois State University. During World War II, some of these figures helped make films that were anti-fascist, at a time when the U.S. was allied with the Soviet Union, and films that had working-class themes, though the films did not explicitly advance communist politics.  In the 1950s, Sen. Joe McCarthy and other sympathetic members of Congress used hearings to root out communists from public life. Some 300 Hollywood figures who refused to cooperate – whether or not they were actual communists – were blacklisted from 1950 to 1960. One reason Crowley is misguided, experts said, is that even the USSR’s limited successes in achieving American influence petered out decades ago.  The Smith Act, passed in the 1940s, essentially outlawed membership in any organization that advocated the overthrow of the government, and leaders of the Communist Party of the USA were prosecuted under it after World War II, Shelton said. Also, he said, the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 forced any union that sought recognition by the National Labor Relations Board to ensure that its leaders signed affidavits that they had never been members of the Communist Party. ""Most unions, including those in Hollywood, complied,"" Shelton said. Communist Party USA leader Gus Hall in custody at La Guardia Airport in New York, with a deputy U.S. marshal on Nov. 2, 1951. (AP) But the biggest factor was McCarthy and his allies. ""Whatever influence (communists) had vanished in the 1940s,"" with the rise of McCarthy-style, anti-communist efforts, Klehr said. Ironically, the USSR had already backed off most of its activities by the time McCarthy’s efforts were under way.  After 1945, Soviet intelligence officials grew terrified that their entire network of Americans would be hauled before the FBI, Allen Weinstein, author of ""The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America,"" said in a 1999 interview. ""So they literally stopped all work,"" Weinstein said. ""Knowing this, it’s ironic to think that four to five years before Sen. Joe McCarthy began his escapades, the spies had stopped their work."" Despite this, in each of the sectors cited by Crowley, the anti-communist backlash was swift. ""Virtually any time communists won any level of influence, they were dramatically repressed, by many layers of government and civil society,"" Shelton said. In K-12 education, for instance, ""hundreds of communist elementary and high school teachers were dismissed from their jobs"" in the 1940s and 1950s, Devinatz said. And the communist-led Teachers Union in New York City was expelled from both the AFL and the CIO, the key labor umbrella groups.  While communists did exist in colleges and universities, Klehr said, ""they never constituted more than a small minority. Higher education today suffers from many ills, including a suffocating left-wing orthodoxy, but much of it is linked to identity politics and is not driven by communists."" And in the media, a few journalists also lost their jobs over Communist Party membership or alleged membership decades ago, Devinatz said. Today, the idea that communists ""control the academy, or the news media, is off the wall,"" Klehr said. Ultimately, even the limited success the USSR had in wooing Americans in key professions should not be confused for overseas communist ""control"" of these institutions, said Larry Tye, author of ""Demagogue: The Life and Long Shadow of Senator Joe McCarthy."" The long history of purges of alleged communists is clear evidence that the individuals who led these institutions were anti-communist, not communist. ""Crowley would claim that anyone with left or liberal ideas is a communist puppet,"" said Jonathan P. Hunt, a professor of rhetoric and language at the University of San Francisco and author of ""Communists in the Classroom: Radicals in U.S. Education,1930-1960."" ""So if I am in favor of racial equality, or workplace safety regulation, or a 40-hour work week, or any of a hundred other political or social positions, then I must be a communist."" Crowley said that Soviet and Chinese communists have ""grabbed control"" of U.S. entertainment, movies, television, music, academia, K-12 education and the news media.  The USSR, and to a lesser extent communist China, have sought to influence the U.S. over decades, including through spying and ideological persuasion. Some individual Americans in entertainment, education, and the media were sympathetic to those ideas, primarily in the 1930s and 1940s. But even these examples are a far cry from proving that each of these pillars of U.S. society were directly controlled by overseas communists. The real-life examples of communist influence are scattered and decades-old. And in each of the sectors Crowley cited, active efforts by anti-communists purged those sympathetic to communism. That couldn’t have happened if these institutions were actually controlled by communists.  We rate the statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E2B6DC0>],/factchecks/2022/jun/17/monica-crowley/pants-fire-claim-communists-have-controlled-us-ins/

A House proposal does not criminalize gun owners for performing maintenance on their guns
","The Democratic-led U.S. House passed a bill restricting access to firearms on many fronts in response to the May mass shooting that left 19 children and two adults dead in Uvalde, Texas.  The Protecting Our Kids Act includes regulations against selling firearms to people under 21, criminal offenses for gun trafficking, and more. It’s almost certain not to progress in the U.S. Senate, where lawmakers are working on a less restrictive set of proposals. An organization that supports easier access to firearms raised alarms about the House legislation, though the group overstated how far the measure would really go. ""U.S. House of Reps. votes 226-194 to criminalize disassembling, cleaning, and re-assembling your gun without a firearm manufacturer’s license, including 8 Republicans!"" tweeted Gun Owners of America. U.S. House of Reps. votes 226-194 to criminalize disassembling, cleaning, and re-assembling your gun without a firearm manufacturer’s license, including 8 Republicans!   The group’s claim received thousands of retweets and comments, and a screenshot was shared on Instagram and Facebook. The post wasn’t specific about what legislation it was referencing. But when we reached out to Gun Owners of America, a spokesperson there pointed us to the Protecting Our Kids Act, or H.R. 7910. That full bill passed by a 223-204 vote, with five Republicans voting in favor, but a portion of the bill dealing specifically with ""ghost guns"" did receive a 226-194 vote with eight Republicans in favor. But does that bill really ban someone from cleaning their gun without a manufacturer’s license? In a word, no. The bill aims to stop a workaround for people who haven’t passed background checks from assembling their own from untraceable parts.  Walter Smoloski, spokesperson for Gun Owners of America, directed us to Title III of the bill, which requires that all firearms be traceable with a serial number. This is an effort to prohibit ""ghost guns,"" or, according to a definition in the legislation, guns that lack ""a unique serial number engraved or cast on the frame or receiver by a licensed manufacturer or importer."" Practically speaking, ""ghost guns"" are often assembled at home from a kit or from a 3D printer.  The finished gun often ""lacks a serial number or other identifying information that is typically required for traditionally manufactured guns,"" said Alex McCourt, director of legal research at the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins University. ""So it’s a privately made, untraceable gun.""  Ghost guns have been a point of contention for lawmakers — in April 2022, the Justice Department announced a rule  to better regulate ghost guns. The Biden administration said that last year the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reported about 20,000 ghost guns had been recovered by law enforcement during criminal investigations — a tenfold increase from 2016. But Smoloski said the House’s bill would regulate parts of a gun that aren’t usually serialized, like the ""upper receiver of an AR-15,"" and thus label the entire firearm as a ghost gun.  It’s true that AR-15 weapons typically have serial numbers on the lower part of the firearm’s receiver. But McCourt said if people bought this type of firearm legally, they are not the target of this bill.  ""The target is not to trick people into committing a crime,"" McCourt said. Gun Owners of America also takes issue with the bill’s definition of manufacturing a gun, which includes ""assembling a functional firearm or molding, machining, or 3D printing a frame or receiver, and shall not include making or fitting special barrels, stocks, or trigger mechanisms to firearms.""  ""H.R. 7910 prohibits anyone from ‘manufactur(ing) a ghost gun,'"" Smoloski said, ""even though ‘manufacturing firearms’ includes anyone disassembling, cleaning, and then ‘assembling’ common gun parts back into ‘a functional firearm.’"" Rukmani Bhatia, senior federal affairs manager at the Giffords anti-gun violence organization, told fact-checkers at The Associated Press that this is not so: ""There is nothing in Title III that would bar a law-abiding gun owner who has a firearm that is serialized from taking that gun apart, cleaning it, and putting it back together in their home."" McCourt also said this section isn’t meant for private owners. ""I think the bill is pretty clearly talking about making ghost guns from kits or other individual parts that lack serial numbers and/or more people that are engaged in the business of firearm manufacturing,"" he said. John Donohue, a law professor at Stanford University and a statistical analyst on topics such as guns and crime, said the Gun Owners of America suggests the worst-possible scenario of what could happen under the bill. The definition of what manufacturing a gun means may be vague, he said, but the scenario that gun owners would be criminalized for cleaning their weapons would be unlikely.  Ultimately, the bill’s goal is to prevent people who could not pass a background check from skirting the law and buying gun parts to assemble into a working firearm.  ""Obviously, if you bought the gun and went through a background check, there wouldn’t be any problem about taking it apart and putting it back together,"" Donohue said. ""Judges would understand this and would presumably apply the law appropriately."" If there was any fear about ambiguity in the law, Donohue said, a simple tweak would solve it. ""Of course there is plenty of opportunity to provide that tweak because the House bill would not go into effect unless the Senate passed a similar bill,"" he said. House Judiciary Committee spokesman Dan Rubin said that the purpose of Title III is to prevent people from building guns at home that lack the ""proper, legal tracking mechanism"" — like a serial number — that every other legal firearm has. ""So, if you currently own a gun that you purchased legally from a federally licensed gun store, it is not a ghost gun and has absolutely nothing to do with this title, and you could clean it, disassemble it or do whatever else you want (in accordance with state and federal laws, of course), and this bill in no way would affect that,"" Rubin said. We found no instances in which Democrats said the measure would ban gun-cleaning. On June 12, a bipartisan group of senators announced it had agreed on the framework for a package that would encourage states to pass ""red flag"" laws to remove firearms from possibly dangerous people, as well as provide finances for mental health resources and school security.  A tweet from Gun Owners of America said, ""U.S. House of Reps. votes 226-194 to criminalize disassembling, cleaning, and re-assembling your gun without a firearm manufacturer’s license, including 8 Republicans!"" The Protecting Our Kids Act passed by a 223-204 vote, with five Republicans in favor; a portion dealing with ghost guns was approved 226-194, with eight Republicans in favor. The bill is unlikely to take effect. As written, it would prevent people who can’t pass a background check from buying untraceable firearm parts and assembling them into a ghost gun. Legal experts said it’s a misreading to suggest the bill would criminalize disassembling, cleaning, and reassembling a gun.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54ECB26C0>],/factchecks/2022/jun/17/gun-owners-america/house-proposal-does-not-criminalize-gun-owners-per/

No, this isn’t Lauren Boebert posing with two half-dressed men
","An image showing a woman posing with two scantily dressed men is circulating online with claims that it shows U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert. Many have shared the image, which someone posted in response to a June 6 tweet in which Boebert, R-Colo., told people to take their children to ""CHURCH, not drag bars."" ""What church did you grow up in?"" said the Twitter response featuring the image. The post has since been re-shared multiple times on other social media websites.  There’s no evidence that the woman in the photo is Boebert, and the congresswoman’s press team confirmed that she was falsely identified. ""That is not Rep. Boebert,"" a spokesperson wrote in an email.   Posts sharing the image were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A reverse-image search revealed that the photograph has appeared online with no connection to Boebert’s name since at least 2015, when it was uploaded to Tumblr, a microblogging and social networking website. That post contained no additional information about the woman or the other people in the image. The first time Boebert’s name appears to have been associated with the image was in March 2022, when it was shared by a Twitter account devoted to parodying Fox News host Tucker Carlson. A photo of a woman posing with two scantily dressed men is being identified as Boebert on social media. There’s no evidence that the woman in the image is Boebert. The photo has been online and unassociated with the congresswoman for years.

No, these mass shootings weren’t a plot to protect Hillary Clinton from negative news coverage
","People often claim that horrific tragedies are staged to distract attention from other news stories. When doing so, it’s wise to check the dates first. A June 14 Facebook post shared by conservative rocker Ted Nugent shows a screenshot implying that three separate mass shootings were timed to distract from various controversies involving former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But a simple Google search shows that the timelines between the shootings and the stories involving Hillary Clinton don’t closely match. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what the post says: — ""Remember when Hillary was testifying about Benghazi? Probably not. You were too busy watching the elementary school massacre in Connecticut."" — ""Remember when Hillary got tattled on by Blumenthal for using illegal servers in the White House? Probably not. You were too busy watching the Charleston church shooting."" — ""Remember that time Hillary’s campaign lawyer went to trial for lying to the FBI about Trumps-Russia collusion? Probably not. You’re too busy watching the Uvalde school shooting massacre."" Let’s address the claims one by one. The first reference is to Clinton’s testimony about the attack on Sept. 11, 2012, by Islamic militants on U.S. sites in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, Foreign Service officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.  Clinton testified before Congress on two separate occasions about the attack. The first was on Jan. 23, 2013, when she testified separately before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 2014, the House established a select committee to further investigate the attack. Clinton, a leading candidate at the time for president, again testified before Congress on Oct. 22, 2015, in a lengthy hearing that was carried live on major news networks and drew wide coverage. The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, where gunman Adam Lanza first killed his mother, then traveled to the school to kill 20 children and six adults before killing himself, happened on Dec. 14, 2012. That’s over a month before Clinton’s first Benghazi testimony and nearly three years before her 2015 testimony. Another claim is a reference to the news that Clinton used a private email address instead of a government account during her time as secretary of state. That news first gained widespread attention after an article in The New York Times on March 2, 2015, but according to The Washington Post, the details first came out in 2013, when a hacker named ""Guccifer"" leaked emails from Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime friend of Clinton who worked as an adviser to President Bill Clinton. The website The Smoking Gun mentioned Clinton’s use of a private email address in its 2013 report about emails sent to her by Blumenthal. The FBI opened an investigation on July 10, 2015, and news coverage of it dogged Clinton for much of her campaign, even after then-FBI Director James Comey announced on July 5, 2016, there would be no charges.  On June 17, 2015, a white supremacist named Dylann Roof killed nine Black people during a Bible study at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. The shooting happened more than three months after news of Clinton’s private email address first gained widespread attention, three weeks before the FBI announced its investigation, and more than two years after Blumenthal’s emails were first leaked by a hacker.  Jury selection began on May 16, 2022, for Michael Sussmann, a Democratic attorney who represented Hillary Clinton’s campaign. He was facing charges that he lied to the FBI by saying he was not working on behalf of a particular client when he gave the FBI information about possible ties between Donald Trump’s campaign and a Russian bank. He was acquitted on May 31 after a two-week trial. On May 24, 2022, Salvador Ramos walked into Robb Elementary school in Uvalde and killed 19 students and two teachers. That shooting took place eight days after Sussman’s trial began. The recent tragedy in Uvalde prompted a flurry of misinformation online, much of which PolitiFact has already debunked.  Such theories are common after mass shootings, and people often make fantastical claims that they are false flags meant to further an agenda like gun control or to distract from another news event. A Facebook post implied that three separate mass shootings — Sandy Hook, Charleston and Uvalde — were timed to distract from various controversies involving Hillary Clinton. There’s no evidence to suggest any of the shootings were staged. And the timing of the shootings do not match up with the events from which they were supposedly meant to distract.  Nugent already has two Pants on Fire ratings from us. This ridiculous claim makes it three: Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E8B0300>],/factchecks/2022/jun/16/ted-nugent/no-these-mass-shootings-werent-plot-protect-hillar/
