No, the Census Bureau didn’t confirm a problem with the 2020 election results
","The U.S. Census Bureau has been sucked into the swirl of misinformation surrounding the 2020 presidential election.  ""US Census Bureau confirms HUGE CONFLICT in total number of voters in 2020 election,"" reads a claim that in recent days has appeared in Facebook posts and blog posts.  They were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On Twitter, a U.S. Senate candidate from New York asked, ""Why did the US Census Bureau just confirm nearly 4 million more people voted in 2020 than were reported in the 2020 census data?""    Some of the posts cited a website called The Election Wizard, which on May 4 published a post titled, ""Census reveals weird anomaly: Shows millions less voted in 2020 election than official tally.""  The site said that the Census tallied 154,628,000 people voting in 2020. The post then went on to say that ""official results place the number of actual ballots cast slightly north of 158 million. That’s a discrepancy of nearly four million votes."" The blog got it wrong. Census Bureau data does not show a discrepancy in the election results.  Here’s why: The data cited on the Election Wizard website comes from numbers released by the Census Bureau in April 2021 about reported voting and registration for the November 2020 election.  According to that data, 154,628,000 people 18 and older reported that they voted in the election. Another 40,561,000 reported that they didn’t vote. But more than 36 million — roughly 36,404,000 — didn’t indicate whether they voted or not. That group included people who were either not asked if they voted, those who responded ""Don’t Know"" and those who refused to answer, according to the Census Bureau. So while the posts spreading online are highlighting a difference of about 4 million between the people who reported they voted and the more than 158,400,000 ballots cast for president in November, these numbers cited don’t tell the whole story, because we don’t know the actions of more than 36 million people who didn’t tell the Census whether they voted or not. To say that the Census Bureau has confirmed a huge discrepancy in the total number of voters in the 2020 election and ballots cast is just wrong.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE43F00>],/factchecks/2021/may/12/facebook-posts/no-census-bureau-didnt-confirm-problem-2020-electi/

Montana leaving federal unemployment program but keeping state benefits
","Social media users misinterpreted an announcement by Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, about the state’s unemployment aid program.   ""Montana is canceling unemployment because of a workforce shortage!"" reads a Facebook post.  The post is misleading. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what really happened:  Gianforte announced on May 4 that Montana planned to leave the federal program that established extra benefits for people receiving unemployment assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Montanans would still be eligible for state unemployment benefits, just not the federal enhancement. With the federal program still in place, unemployed Montanans were eligible for between $451 and $810 per week in benefits. In June, when Montana is scheduled to leave the program, weekly benefits are set to fall to between $151 and $510 per week. As part of the CARES Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in March 2020, the federal government approved $600 in additional weekly benefits for unemployed workers on top of state unemployment benefits. After that benefit expired in July, it was replaced by $300 weekly payments included in another relief package in December. The American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion package that  President Joe Biden signed in March 2021, extended those benefits through Labor Day.  Gianforte cast his plan to leave the federal program as an attempt to combat a state labor shortage. ""Montana is open for business again, but I hear from too many employers throughout our state who can’t find workers. Nearly every sector in our economy faces a labor shortage,"" he said in a statement.  Withdrawing from the federal program is one of two measures that Gianforte announced in May to spur hiring. The second is the launch of a return-to-work program that will grant previously unemployed Montanans a $1,200 bonus if they remain steadily employed for at least a month. The return-to-work bonus will be federally funded by the American Rescue Plan.  Montana is the first state to announce plans to leave the federal unemployment program. A few days later, South Carolina became the second, with Gov. Henry McMaster scheduling a withdrawal from the program by June 30.  ""Montana is canceling unemployment because of a workforce shortage!"" reads a Facebook post.  Gianforte announced that the state will withdraw from the federal unemployment assistance program established to help those out of work during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the state unemployment program remains in place. The change means that two-thirds of weekly benefits on the low end of assistance and two-fifths on the high end will effectively be canceled. The statement is partially accurate but missing critical context, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA19F40>],/factchecks/2021/may/12/facebook-posts/montana-leaving-federal-unemployment-program-keepi/

"['Education', 'Virginia', 'Terry McAuliffe']","
McAuliffe overstates school progress in Petersburg, Va. during his governorship
","Former and perhaps future Gov. Terry McAuliffe recently said that student performance in Peterburg, one of Virginia’s most financially troubled cities, vastly improved when he led the state from 2014 to 2018. During a May 6 debate with four other candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, McAuliffe said that when he took office, two-thirds of Petersburg’s public schools were unaccredited by the state because of poor academic performance. ""I’m very proud to say by the end of our term, with a lot of resources and a lot of help, every single Petersburg school was accredited when I left office,"" he said. McAuliffe’s statement was disputed by former Del. Jennifer Carroll  Foy, who grew up in Petersburg and also is running in the June 8 Democratic primary for governor. So, we looked into McAuliffe’s claim that all Petersburg schools were accredited at the end of his term and found a lot of problems. Through 2017, Virginia accreditation of schools was based almost entirely on their students’ performance on standardized state tests.  In 2018, additional factors were added such as absenteeism, learning gaps between students of different ethnicity and dropout rates. McAuliffe’s term as governor ended in January 2018. Since he said every Petersburg school was accredited when he ""left office,"" we looked at records from the 2017-2018 school year. They show none of the city’s six public schools was fully accredited then. In contrast, 86% of schools across the state were fully accredited. Three Petersburg schools were denied accreditation that year and three were partially accredited. McAuliffe’s campaign, however, told us the former governor’s claim is based on ratings for the 2018-2019 school year, which began months after McAuliffe left office. The campaign pointed out that there is a one-year lag in Virginia’s accreditation process. That means credentialing for the post-McAuliffe 2018-2019 school year was based on tests that were taken when he was still governor and, according to his campaign, should be in McAuliffe’s record. Although the point is credible, it also boosts McAuliffe’s record because the state Board of Education, filled with his appointees, enacted major changes to the accreditation process starting in the 2018-2019 school year. The board - carrying out a McAuliffe campaign promise - deemphasized standardized test results in determining whether a school is credentialed and added new measures such as absenteeism, achievement gaps between students of different backgrounds, and whether a school is showing improvement on the state exams.  Under the new standards, 92% of Virginia’s schools were fully accredited in 2018-2019 - up 6 percentage points from the previous year.  McAuliffe’s claim that ""every single Petersburg school was accredited"" is misleading. Only two of the city’s six schools were fully accredited - up none the previous year. The other four schools were ""conditionally accredited,"" meaning they were performing below state standards in at least one area and required remedial action. They were among the bottom-performing 7% of schools in Virginia. McAuliffe’s statement skirts another important factor: No Virginia public school has been denied accreditation since the new standards went into effect - conditionally accredited is the worst rating that has been doled out. (The state did not go through the rating process for the 2020-2021 school year because of COVID-19). During the 2017-2018 school year - the last under the old standards - 88 schools were denied accreditation. When McAuliffe made his claim during the debate, Carroll Foy replied, ""I would like to say that facts matter, and right now there is only one accredited school in Petersburg, Va."" She was referring to the 2019-2020 ratings - the most recent - which fully accredited one of the city’s schools and deemed the other five conditionally accredited. Under McAuliffe’s language, no distinction would be made and all six of the schools would be described as accredited. Our ruling McAuliffe says, ""Every single Petersburg school was accredited when I left office,"" implying there was a turnaround in the city’s scholastic performance during his time as governor. He’s dead wrong if you look at the end of his term in January 2018, when none of the city’s public schools was fully accredited by the state based on standardized testing, three were denied accreditation, and three were partially certified. There’s a one-year lag in Virginia’s school accreditation, however, and McAuliffe’s campaign says he was referring to 2019 ratings that reflected Petersburg's academic performance from a year earlier, when McAuliffe left office. It’s a credible argument that McAuliffe should be judged on the 2019 rates, but it’s also highly advantageous to him because standards were eased that year and no Virginia public school was denied accreditation.  Two of Petersburg’s six schools were fully accredited in 2019, while 92% of schools across the state met that ideal. The other four were conditionally accredited, meaning they were performing below standards in at least one area and were required to take corrective actions. They were among the worst-performing 7% of Virginia schools. So there are problems with McAuliffe’s claim, even when we give him the advantage of using the 2019 ratings. By saying all Petersburg schools were accredited - and deftly avoiding the distinction between fully and conditionally accredited - he creates a misleading impression of the city’s progress during his term. We rate McAuliffe’s statement Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE4E4C0>],/factchecks/2021/may/12/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-overstates-school-progress-petersburg-va/
"['Legal Issues', 'Taxes', 'Marijuana', 'Wisconsin', 'Tony Evers']","
Wisconsin marijuana revenue projections valid, but overly optimistic
","Gov. Tony Evers proposed that Wisconsin keep up with three of its neighbors and legalize marijuana, but the plan has already gone up in smoke. The GOP-controlled Legislature’s budget-writing committee on May 6, 2021 removed legalizing marijuana -- and hundreds of other provisions -- from the governor’s proposed 2021-’23 spending plan. In making the changes, and starting fresh, the panel created a gap of about $3.4 billion.  With that gap, and polls showing general public support for legalized marijuana, it brought to mind a claim from Evers that we had set aside: ""Regulating and taxing marijuana — much like we do alcohol — would generate more than $165M in revenue starting in 2022,"" Evers tweeted April 14, 2021.  In all, 36 states have medical marijuana programs (including Iowa), while 14 states -- including neighboring Illinois and Michigan -- have legalized marijuana for recreational use: But what about the money? Is Evers correct that his plan would add $165 million to the state’s coffers in the upcoming budget?  When asked for backup to the claim, Britt Cudaback, Evers’ communications director, pointed us to the state’s ""Budget in Brief"" document, released in February 2021, which includes more detail on how his plan would work. Under the plan, the state Department of Revenue would issue permits to those wishing to sell recreational marijuana. ""The Governor’s proposal imposes a 15 percent excise tax on the sales price of each wholesale sale by a permit-holding producer to a permit-holding processor,"" according to the budget document. ""In addition, the proposal imposes a 10 percent excise tax on the sales price of each retail sale. Retail sales, except for medical use, would be subject to the sales tax.""  So, how did the governor arrive at that $165 million figure? According to Cudaback, the budget office looked at data from other states, including Colorado, which was the first state to legalize marijuana, and made adjustments for population and ""reported marijuana usage."" She noted that other states have relied on Colorado’s data in developing their own budgets, and noted that the estimates were on the conservative side, meaning they could be closer to the low end of potential tax revenue. According to the Evers figures, if sales were to begin Jan. 1, 2022 -- roughly six months after expected passage of the budget -- $165.8 million would be reached if tax collections were $19 per-capita. That is, if -- on average -- every person in the state bought enough marijuna to generate $19 in annual tax revenue. Here is the math: $19 per capita per year x 5.8 million population x 1.5 years = $165.8 million. That includes a projected $65 million from taxes on sales at the wholesale level, $67.1 million from retail taxes and $33.6 million from the sales tax.  It’s difficult to compare states because of their varying size and different taxing structures around marijuana sales.  For instance, Illinois has a lower excise tax, but far higher sales taxes on recreational marijuana, and more than double Wisconsin’s population. According to the Public Policy Forum, a non-partisan think tank that has analyzed the Wisconsin budget, Illinois likely collected around $175 million in revenue in its first year of recreational implementation.  That’s not much more -- despite twice the population size -- than what Evers is anticipating. The administration's estimate appears to imply a pretty rapid implementation, the Policy Forum said.  Nevada, meanwhile, has a 15% tax on wholesale sales and a 10% tax on retail sales, so its framework is generally similar. In fiscal year 2020, with just over half of Wisconsin’s population, Nevada collected $105.2 million. That said, the Policy Forum notes Nevada’s unique tourism industry -- i.e., legalized gambling -- may make it a poor basis for comparison. Andrew Reschovsky, University of Wisconsin-Madison Professor Emeritus of Public Affairs and Applied Economics pointed out that ""forecasting revenue from a new tax is always difficult."" He said the State Budget Office has taken the ""sensible"" approach and based its estimates on the experience of other states that have already legalized marijuana sales. But that doesn’t mean it’s sure to come true.  ""The Administration’s forecast, like all revenue forecasts, is based on a set of assumptions,"" he wrote. ""While some of the Administration’s assumptions may result in an under-estimate of tax revenues, I do worry that the state may be overly optimistic about the time needed to implement the issuing of both medical and recreational marijuana retail sales licenses and the time needed to open retail outlets throughout the state.""  In other words, the state may not be able to get a system up and running in time to meet the Jan. 1, 2022 date the budget projections are based upon. ""Based on the experiences in Massachusetts and California, this may be an overly optimistic estimate of the time it takes to license and open retail sales outlets,"" Reschovsky wrote. ""If the rollout process is in fact slower than anticipated, revenue during the next biennium may be lower than the Administration’s forecast."" Evers tweeted ""Regulating and taxing marijuana — much like we do alcohol — would generate more than $165M in revenue starting in 2022.  Experts consulted by PolitiFact Wisconsin, generally speaking, had no quarrel with the state’s math, but questioned the implementation schedule baked into the estimates. In other words, if legalized marijuana were to go forward, it may not generate the revenue Evers claimed because it may take too long to get a licensing system in place, and to license and open retail outlets. In a nutshell, the Evers projections are plausible, but may be overly optimistic. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, our rating is Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE3DD80>],/factchecks/2021/may/12/tony-evers/legal-marijuana-revenue-projections-valid-skew-ove/

Biden boasts about equitable senior COVID-19 vaccination rate by race without data to back it up
","During May 3 remarks on the American Families Plan, President Joe Biden boasted that there was not much disparity in the Covid-19 vaccination rates for white Americans and Americans of color who are at least 65. ""And what’s happening now is all the talk about how people were not going to get shots, they were not going to be involved — look at what that was — we were told that was most likely to be among people over 65 years of age,"" said Biden. ""But now people over 65 years of age, over 80%, have now been vaccinated, and 66% fully vaccinated. And there’s virtually no difference between white, Black, Hispanic, Asian American."" This isn’t the only time that Biden has made the claim. He went even further on April 27 during remarks on the Covid-19 response: ""And, by the way, based on reported data, the proportion — the proportion of seniors who have been vaccinated is essentially equal between white and seniors of color. … As a matter of a fact, if I’m not mistaken, there are more Latinos and African American seniors that have been vaccinated, as a percentage, than white seniors."" However, the national data that Biden keeps touting — vaccination statistics regarding both race and age — is not public. We asked the White House for the information underlying this claim, but officials did not provide specifics. So, we moved on to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Spokesperson Chandra Zeikel told KHN-PolitiFact on May 6 that ""unfortunately, we don’t have available a data breakdown of both racial demographics and age together."" Zeikel didn’t respond to a follow-up question asking when or if the CDC would be publishing this data, but current CDC vaccination data is broken down only by race/ethnicity and shows significant differences, with white Americans far outpacing the percentage of other groups getting a shot. It also shows that the rate of vaccinations among some groups, including Black and Latino Americans, does not match their share of the population, though new CDC data shows there has been some progress on this front in the last two weeks. Meanwhile, the CDC published a report May 11 based on the first 3.5 months of the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program that described limited race/ethnicity data for those older than 65 who have received at least one vaccine dose. Although the data reflects some gains in vaccination equity, those rates do not hold across different ethnic and racial categories. In addition, about 40% of vaccine records were missing race and ethnicity data. That made us wonder about the premise of Biden’s statement. We turned to experts for their take. ""As far as I know, there is no comprehensive publicly available data on vaccination rates by race/ethnicity and age,"" Samantha Artiga, vice president and director of the racial equity and health policy program at KFF, wrote in an email. ""As such, we are not able to assess whether there are racial disparities in vaccinations among people over 65 years of age."" What about other state-level data or anecdotes that might support Biden’s claim? Let’s dive in and see. At least seven states track vaccination based on a combination of age and race, according to Artiga: Michigan, South Carolina, West Virginia, Kansas, Minnesota, Washington and Vermont (Vermont tracks only two racial categories: non-Hispanic white and a combination of Black, Indigenous and people of color.) The results from some of these states show that racial disparities do exist in the older age groups. In Michigan, for instance, over 50% of non-Hispanic white people ages 65 to 74 had completed their vaccinations as of May 11. Other racial groups — non-Hispanic Black people; Asian American and Pacific Islanders; and Hispanics — all trailed by about 10 percentage points. The exception was the Native American and Alaska Natives category, which was within 4 percentage points of white people. And as of May 11 in Kansas, the rate at which white people in that same age group were vaccinated was higher than the rates of Black people and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders. In Vermont, for those 65 and up, about 79% of people of color had received at least one dose of the vaccine, compared with 85% of white people as of that date. ""With the exception of Vermont, which has the distinction of being the only state to target BIPOC [Black, Indigenous and people of color] populations by race explicitly, these are examples of states in which the numbers are not doing well in their equity efforts,"" Dayna Bowen Matthew, dean of the George Washington University Law School and an expert in racial disparities in health care, wrote in an email. Minnesota is one of the few states in which people of color are actually being vaccinated at higher rates than white people — with 93% of Asian/Pacific Islanders and 87.5% of Black/African Americans age 65 and over having received at least one shot, compared with 81.5% of white people as of May 11. Some states are vaccinating similar percentages of their population of Black or Hispanic people, Matthew said, however that data does not distinguish by age group. According to Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Vaccination Racial Gap tracker, New Mexico, Idaho, Oregon and Utah have vaccinated approximately the same percentage of Black Americans as are represented in each state’s population. Maine, Ohio, Alabama, Louisiana and Missouri have achieved similar population-based rates for the Hispanic population. KFF provides weekly updates on national and state race/ethnicity data of those who have received vaccinations, which have consistently shown that Black and Hispanic people are receiving smaller shares of vaccinations compared with their shares of the total population, while white people are receiving a higher share. The May 5 weekly update, for instance, found that based on the 42 states that share race/ethnicity data, the percentage of white people who have received at least one Covid vaccine dose (39%) was roughly 1.5 times higher than the rates for Black (25%) and Hispanic people (27%). (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.) It’s also important to note that data on race and ethnicity information has not been gathered for many people who have been vaccinated. As of May 3, the CDC reported that race and ethnicity were known for only 55% of all people who had received at least one vaccine dose. And three states, Montana, New Hampshire and Wyoming, don’t report race/ethnicity data at all. Nneka Sederstrom, chief health equity officer at Hennepin Healthcare in Minneapolis, said that her state has done an ""excellent job"" vaccinating the 65-and-older population but that there’s still a lot of work to be done to reach communities of color. We ""will need more direct tactics to reach"" those who haven’t yet been vaccinated, ""and help address any issues of hesitancy due to lack of knowledge or systemic barriers,"" Sederstrom wrote in an email. Ensuring that vaccines are available at primary care providers is also important, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. ""The truth of the matter is, the more vaccinators that we can get that are placed where people are every day, where it becomes a routine part of your life, such as going … into your doctor’s office for a regular visit, that’s a winner,"" said Benjamin. But, Dr. Uché Blackstock, founder of Advancing Health Equity, an organization that advocates to end bias and racism in health care, said she would set the bar for vaccine equity success higher than just an equally proportionate share of a certain racial/ethnic population receiving their vaccine doses. ""What success in vaccine equity would look like would be if Black people or Hispanic people were overrepresented in terms of vaccine received since they have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic,"" said Blackstock. So even though Biden quotes these statistics that lack data behind them, if the evidence did support them, it would still not be enough, she said. In fact, the CDC does describe vaccine equity in those terms: ""preferential access and administration to those who have been most affected by Covid-19."" Biden has repeatedly claimed that vaccination rates among white people and people of color age 65 and older are virtually the same — or even higher among people of color. No public national data from the CDC or another database has been released to support this assertion. For the few states that do report data on age and race/ethnicity combined, the numbers suggest that, for the most part, obvious disparities persist in the vaccination rates for white seniors and seniors of color. In several states, vaccine administration rates are more proportional to the percentage of the Black and Hispanic populations, but the data covers all age groups. National data for all age groups also shows that rates of vaccinations for Black and Hispanic people lag behind that of white people. Existing data paints one story on vaccine equity, while Biden’s words paint another. Without data to back it up, we rate Biden’s statement False.  Update: This report was updated to include a May 11 CDC report with additional data on race, ethnicity and age. The rating is unchanged.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECACB780>],/factchecks/2021/may/11/joe-biden/biden-boasts-about-equitable-senior-covid-19-vacci/

CO2 output from making an electric car battery isn't equal to driving a gasoline car for 8 years
","Electric vehicles are touted as an environmentally friendly alternative to gasoline powered cars, but one Facebook post claims that the benefits are overblown, and the vehicles are much more harmful to the planet than people assume. A cartoon posted to Facebook on April 29, shows a car in one panel with ""diesel"" written on the side and the driver thinking ""I feel so dirty."" In another panel, a car has ""electric"" written on its side with the driver thinking ""I feel so clean."" However, the electric vehicle is shown connected to what appears to be a factory that’s blowing dark smoke into the air. Below the cartoon is a caption that claims ""manufacturing the battery for one electric car produces the same amount of CO2 as running a petrol car for eight years."" This isn’t a new line of criticism against electric vehicles. Similar Facebook posts have taken aim at the carbon dioxide produced in the manufacturing of electric cars — specifically the batteries — to make the case that zero emissions vehicles aren’t necessarily clean. Full electric vehicles require a large lithium-ion battery to store energy and power the motor that propels the car, according to Insider. The lithium-ion battery packs in an electric car are chemically similar to the ones found in cell phones and laptops. Because they require a mix of metals that need to be extracted and refined, lithium-ion batteries take more energy to produce than the common lead-acid batteries used in gasoline cars to help start the engine. How much CO2 is emitted in the production depends on where the lithium-ion battery is made — or specifically, how the electricity powering the factory is generated — according to Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist and director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute, an environmental research think tank. Producing a 75 kilowatt-hour battery for a Tesla Model 3, considered on the larger end of batteries for electric vehicles, would result in the emission of 4,500 kilograms of CO2 if it was made at Tesla's battery factory in Nevada. That’s the emissions equivalent to driving a gas-powered sedan for 1.4 years, at a yearly average distance of 12,000 miles, Hausfather said. If the battery were made in Asia, manufacturing it would produce 7,500 kg of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent of driving a gasoline-powered sedan for 2.4 years — but still nowhere near the eight years claimed in the Facebook post. Hausfather said the larger emission amount in Asia can be attributed to its ""higher carbon electricity mix."" The continent relies more on coal for energy production, while Tesla’s Nevada factory uses some solar energy.  ""More than half the emissions associated with manufacturing the battery are associated with electricity use,"" Hausfather said in an email to PolitiFact. ""So, as the electricity grid decarbonizes, emissions associated with battery production will decline. The same is not true for sedan tailpipe emissions."" The Facebook post does not mention the electricity needs and CO2 impact of factories that build gasoline or diesel cars and their components.  Another thing the Facebook post omits is that the CO2 emitted in the production of the battery can be offset over a short time in an electric car by the lack of tailpipe emissions when it’s in operation.  The Union of Concerned Scientists found in a 2015 report that taking into account electricity sources for charging, an electric vehicle ends up reducing greenhouse gas emissions by about 50% compared with a similar size gas-powered car. A midsize vehicle completely negates the carbon dioxide its production emits by the time it travels 4,900 miles, according to the report. For full size cars, it takes 19,000 miles of driving. The U.S. Energy Department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy also looked at the life cycle of electric vehicles — which includes a car’s production, use and disposal — and concluded they produce less greenhouse gases and smog than gasoline-powered vehicles.

The production of lithium-ion batteries for electric cars emits a significant amount of carbon dioxide, but nowhere near the level claimed in the cartoon.

In it, the scientists say that ""Fungi thrive in radiation intense environments,"" and imply that Mars provides such an environment.  ""Sequential photos document that fungus-like Martian specimens emerge from the soil and increase in size, including those resembling puffballs,"" the paper reads. The researchers claim to have studied photos of the same location on Mars several days apart as proof that fungus ""grew"" over time.  In the paper’s ""conclusions"" section, the researchers acknowledge that ""minerals, weathering and unknown geological forces that are unique to Mars"" could be causing the changes captured in the images.  But the paper still goes on to conclude: ""However, growth, movement, alterations in location and shape, constitute behavior, and coupled with life-like morphology, strongly support the hypothesis there is life on Mars."" The paper has caused false headlines and social media posts that claim scientists have found ""proof of life"" on Mars to emerge.  A number of news outlets have debunked claims that emerged because of this study, which experts have said isn’t credible. When asked if there was any credible evidence that fungi were discovered on Mars, scientists agreed there wasn’t. ""No — especially for a claim of this magnitude,"" said Dr. Kenneth Nealson, a professor emeritus of earth sciences and an expert at the University of Southern California on microbial life in extreme environments. ""I don’t know who reviewed the paper, but I would take away their license as a biologist — especially as a microbiologist.""  Dr. Edwin Kite, an assistant professor in the department of the geophysical sciences and a planetary geoscientist and Mars expert at the University of Chicago, said the formations photographed were examples of something else entirely.  ""These features are well understood,"" he said, before linking to a photo example.

"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says that with what ""we have done,"" Texas created 1 million jobs while rest of nation lost 2.5 million
","
Gov. Rick Perry, who trumpets his job creation know-how, has a new favorite factoid about Texas job gains.

He revisited it at the top of the Sept. 7 Republican presidential debate at the Reagan library in California after NBC News anchor Brian Williams asked whether Texas, with its poverty rates and highest-in-the-nation share of minimum-wage workers, is the ""kind of answer Americans are looking for.""

""Actually, what Americans are looking for is someone who can get this country working again,"" Perry replied. ""And we put the model in place in the state of Texas. When you look at what we have done over the last decade, we created 1 million jobs in the state of Texas. At the same time, America lost 2.5 million.""

Texas created 1 million jobs while the country shed 2.5 million—because of what ""we"" did?

Granted, Texas has enjoyed phenomenal job growth over most of the time Perry has been governor, though how much came due to his leadership is debatable. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney hinted as much in the debate, saying: ""Texas is a great state. Texas has zero income tax. Texas has a right to work state, a Republican Legislature, a Republican Supreme Court. Texas has a lot of oil and gas in the ground,"" Romney said. ""Those are wonderful things, but Gov. Perry doesn't believe that he created those things.""

In a post-debate interview, economist Thomas Saving, director of Texas A&M University’s Private Enterprise Research Center, chimed in that Texas has relatively low state debt and endured less of a housing bubble than many states. Still, he said, the state’s economy might have been strong over the past decade regardless of who was governor.

Pia Orrenius, an economist for the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve Bank, told us in a June interview that the Texas economy has been roaring since 1990. ""Long before Rick Perry"" became governor, she said, ""we were talking about the great Texas economy. There are so many exciting things about the Texas economy that precede any political flavor of the month."" She listed as favorable factors the state’s range of natural resources, its energy and high-tech sectors, its booming Gulf ports and its surging trade with Mexico and China.

Also, we recognize that job-gain claims can overreach. An example: Perry’s January 2009 claim that about 70 percent of the U.S. jobs created between November 2007 and November 2008 were in Texas. We rated that claim False because the percentage was based on comparing new jobs in Texas with new jobs in 13 other states and the District of Columbia where job gains outnumbered losses; it ignored jobs created in 36 states where job losses overall outnumbered gains.

Back to the present: Perry debuted his latest Texas-versus-the nation jobs’ boast at an Iowa campaign stop in August. Afterward, Perry’s campaign told us it compared the total number of non-farm jobs in Texas versus the rest of the nation for December 2000, when Perry became governor, and July 2011. Such figures are tracked by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In December 2000, Texas had 9,537,900 jobs, while the other 49 states and the District of Columbia had 123,032,200, Perry spokesman Mark Miner said. And in July 2011, Texas had 10,619,800 jobs while the rest of the county had 120,577,500. So, Miner said, Texas had 1,081,900 more jobs than it did in late 2000 while the rest of the country had 2,454,700 fewer jobs.

By email, bureau economist Lindsay Davis told us those numbers are accurate.

So, Texas ended up with a lot more jobs than before, and other states, together, accounted for even more net job losses.

Specifically, Texas was among more than 20 states with net job gains in the period, while more than 25 states landed up with net job losses. In raw numbers, the net job losers were topped by California and Ohio, which together accounted for about 1.1 million fewer jobs. Michigan experienced the nation’s greatest percentage slide, more than 15 percent.

Conversely, while Texas had the greatest raw job gain, its 11.3 percent growth rate for the period was less than the percentage increases for Utah, Alaska, Wyoming and North Dakota, which led the nation with a 21 percent increase. Side note: The number of full-time positions in Texas state government went up about 7 percent from 2000 to 2010, according to the Legislative Budget Board’s Fiscal Size-up reports, from 222,685 to more than 238,404.

Providing out-of-state perspective on Perry’s comparison, Lee McPheters, director of the Economic Outlook Center at Arizona State University, said by email that it’s natural that the most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — also would generate big raw job gains and losses.

It’s also crucial to notice the time period being analyzed, he said. For instance, Florida outpaced Texas in job growth from 2000 and 2007, he said, but then lost jobs for three years. Texas experienced steady job losses in a shorter period, from late 2008 through 2009. He wrote: ""So the difference is in the recent years, where states such as Florida and California dropped out of the job growth derby while Texas continued to add jobs in 2010 and into 2011."" 
So, how does Perry's comparison stand up?

At a glance, it reflects the health of the Texas economy in his time as governor and the state’s perpetual outsize significance in terms of raw job counts.

Yet there's also a meaningful weakness in such a comparison. The governor of any state with net job gains in the period over the past decade could make a similar declaration, leaving the misimpression that just their state gained jobs while the rest of the country lost jobs. In this vein, for instance, Alaska created 43,700 jobs while the rest of America lost 1.4 million. Left out of this formulation is that 20-plus other states also had job gains.

Also, as experts note, the Texas economy was rocking before Perry became governor. Romney’s point sticks; most of each state’s economic circumstances—in Texas' case: no state income tax and vast natural resources, for starters—aren’t set by the governor.

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg claims population growth in Lower Manhattan exceeds combined totals in Atlanta, Dallas and Philadelphia
","
The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 may have forever changed the landscape of Lower Manhattan, but they didn’t stop more and more people from calling the area home.

Ten years since that fateful day, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has a statistic to prove it: the population of Lower Manhattan has nearly doubled, surpassing the combined growth in three major American cities.

""Over the past 10 years, the number of people living in Lower Manhattan has nearly doubled,"" Bloomberg said during a Sept. 6 speech. ""In fact, Lower Manhattan has added more people over the last 10 years than Atlanta, Dallas and Philadelphia combined. In 2001, no one could have believed that that would happen.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Bloomberg’s numbers are accurate. Based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, most of the area below Canal Street saw a net population increase of 26,870 between 2000 and 2010. The population in that area last year was 59,316 -- an increase of nearly 83 percent.

Atlanta, Dallas and Philadelphia saw population increases during the same time period of 3,529, 9,236 and 8,456, respectively, according to census data. That’s a combined total of 21,221.

Let’s explain how Bloomberg defines ""Lower Manhattan"" to reach his population estimate.

To back up the mayor’s point, Bloomberg spokesman Andrew Brent sent us a chart prepared by the city’s Department of City Planning. 
That chart breaks down population changes in 12 ""census tracts"" representing the area south of Canal Street, west of Centre Street and south of the Brooklyn Bridge. The changes in those census tracts totaled 26,870 new residents between 2000 and 2010.

Canal Street is widely considered a dividing line between Lower Manhattan and the rest of the borough.

However, we also found a separate analysis by the Department of City Planning that claims a smaller population increase of 19,611 for an area defined as ""Battery Park City-Lower Manhattan."" Comprised of seven census tracts, that smaller area excludes several northern blocks closer to Canal Street.

Still, that analysis cautions that ""(Neighborhood Tabulation Area) boundaries and their associated names may not definitively represent neighborhoods.""

Jovana Rizzo, a City Planning spokeswoman, further confirmed in an email that the ""26,870 number is the more appropriate reflection of Lower Manhattan (south of Canal St)."" So Bloomberg’s figure of 26,870 new residents in Lower Manhattan is correct.

Now, let’s talk about why people have moved there.

Even before Sept. 11, Lower Manhattan was being transformed into more of a residential community. Office space in the financial district was being converted for residential use, industrial lofts in Tribeca were being revamped and new construction was under way in Battery Park City, according to Sharon Zukin, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College.

Drawn by housing prices, waterfront access and other amenities, people were carving out a residential community where none existed before, Zukin said.

""They became emotionally attached to living in Lower Manhattan,"" said Zukin, referring to the existing residents on Sept. 11.

More residents came to Lower Manhattan as housing prices dipped in the years following Sept. 11, said Pace University professor Farrokh Hormozi, who once helped prepare a formerly ongoing university report on economic activity in Lower Manhattan.

After the transformation began around 2004, the level of economic activity surpassed its pre-Sept. 11 levels by 2007, Hormozi said.

""It is a very interesting part of the City of New York,"" Hormozi said. ""It has something to offer and people are taking advantage of that.""

The population increase in Lower Manhattan also coincided with ""a development boom that was fueled by two public incentive programs,"" including the availability of $1.6 billion in federal funding between 2001 and 2005, according to the Alliance for Downtown New York.

These days, the residential vacancy rate sits at 0.7 percent, according to the Alliance.

Our ruling

Nearing the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Bloomberg claimed the population in Lower Manhattan has nearly doubled, exceeding the combined growth in Atlanta, Dallas and Philadelphia.

Census data backs up his statement. Many people not only paid more attention to Lower Manhattan in the years following Sept. 11. They moved there.

We rate the statement True.

"['Bankruptcy', 'Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Legal Issues', 'Vincent ""Buddy"" Cianci']","
Cianci says Chafee staffer Michael Trainor still owes $250,000 to R.I.
","
Talk-radio host and former Providence Mayor Vincent A. ""Buddy"" Cianci Jr. recently referred to a member of Governor Chafee’s staff as ""the guy who still owes $250,000 to the state.""

Cianci’s jab at Michael F. Trainor,  aired on Sept. 1, 2011 on WPRO’s ""The Buddy Cianci Show.""

Because it wasn’t the first time that Cianci had made the comment -- and because a bankruptcy judge had ""discharged"" most of Trainor’s debt nearly a year ago -- we thought it was worth looking into.

Trainor has built a career in public relations representing some of the state’s high-profile politicians and corporate players. He was an advisor and spokesman for Lincoln Chafee during Chafee’s successful 2010 run for governor.

But Trainor has had his own public relations problems ever since it became known late last year that he and a business partner from Connecticut defaulted on a $250,000 federal small business loan granted through the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation.

According to the EDC and bankruptcy court documents,  here’s what happened:

The duo and two of their partners started a Rhode Island company, called Genesis Distribution & Marketing, in 2006 to distribute and market retractable window screens and hurricane shutters.

Trainor and his partners had already bought a company in Connecticut that distributed and installed hurricane shutters. And they planned to buy three more in the South that made the shutters. In January 2007, the EDC loaned  the business $250,000 through the federally funded Small Business Loan Fund to buy inventory, furniture, fixtures and equipment and hire three employees.

But the business was short-lived.

Just two months after receiving the EDC loan, the partners fell behind on their payments. In 2008, the company folded.

Trainor and his partner from Connecticut, who had pledged their homes as collateral for the loan, talked with representatives from the EDC about a settlement. But the talks broke off in August 2009, when Trainor notified the agency that he was filing for bankruptcy.

By then, the housing market had tanked along with the value of Trainor’s house.  

The partners had repaid $36,326 of the loan; with interest and late fees, the debt on the loan at the time totaled $250,723.

In September 2010, a bankruptcy judge granted Trainor’s petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
An explanation of the ruling in the bankruptcy court documents states: ""The chapter 7 discharge order eliminates a debtor's legal obligation to pay a debt that is discharged.’’

The EDC loan was written off on Nov. 30, 2010. The agency concluded that it couldn’t recover any money from its lien on Trainor’s home because the mortgage balance exceeded the property’s value.

In December, 2010, Trainor, who was being considered for a job in the Chafee administration, told The Providence Journal that he had not walked away from his obligations, saying he’d like to negotiate a settlement with the EDC.

Governor Chafee discussed Trainor’s situation on Channel 12 ""Newsmakers"" in December 2010, saying that there would be an effort made to repay the EDC. ""[We’ll] make sure Mike does that,’’ he said.

So it certainly sounded then as though Chafee and even Trainor himself believed that Trainor still owed the EDC the money.  

Chafee hired Trainor as spokesman when he took office in January, a job that paid $129,235.

That month, Trainor also repaid the state $20,788.75 in taxes -- which were not  dischargeable in the bankruptcy -- owed on his failed business. In return, the state Division of Taxation removed the lien on his property. 
Six months later, in July, the bank sold his house at a foreclosure auction. 
Trainor served seven months as Chafee’s spokesman before he was transferred, in August, to the Department of Higher Education. His salary has dropped to $88,177. 
So, does he still owe the $250,000, as Cianci claims?

""That debt was discharged,’’ Andrew S. Richardson, a lawyer and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court Trustee in the Trainor case, said. ""(He) can no longer be forced to pay the obligation -- nor can the creditor take any steps to try and collect it.’’

In other words, Richardson said, there’s no legal obligation that Trainor repay the loan.

But other lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy see it differently.

""Most people understand (bankruptcy) as destroying the debt … but technically the discharge in bankruptcy doesn’t destroy the debt at all,’’ Jason Kilborn, a lawyer, law professor and resident scholar at the American Bankruptcy Institute in Virginia said. ""It does not destroy the obligation from a moral or even a legal obligation. It just prevents the creditors from collecting on that debt.’’

The American Bankruptcy Institute was founded in 1982 to provide Congress and the public with unbiased analysis of bankruptcy issues.

In other words, the debt remains, even though the creditors are forced to write it off as uncollectable.

So if the debt remains but Trainor isn’t obligated to repay it, does he really ""owe"" the state money?

We called Cianci and challenged him on his use of the term ""owes.""  Trainor’s bankruptcy discharge, he maintained, doesn’t change the fact that Trainor still owes the EDC the $250,000.

""Maybe it was discharged,’’ he said, ""but in the mind of the taxpayer who fronted the 250 grand? Yeah, he still owes it.""

Said Richardson, the trustee: ""I think it depends on whose point of view you’re looking at, the creditor or the debtor.’’

We agree.

Practically speaking, the bankruptcy ruling and the fact that the mortgage on the Trainor’s home exceeded its value made it impossible for the EDC to recoup its money.

But even after the debt was discharged in bankruptcy Trainor and Chafee both said they’d make an effort made to repay the EDC.

After all, a debt can be owed even if it’s never collected.

For that reason, we rule Cianci’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFFEAC0>],/factchecks/2011/sep/11/vincent-buddy-cianci/cianci-says-chafee-staffer-michael-trainor-still-o/
"['Workers', 'Wisconsin', 'Chain email']","
Email claims physical fitness tests will be required for Wisconsin Department of Corrections staff
","
A fake story purporting to be from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s website got thousands of workers at the state’s Department of Corrections buzzing.

And then re-buzzing.

Some 10,000 employees of the state agency that oversees prisons received an email on Sept. 6, 2011, that included a ""story"" with the byline of Jason Stein, a reporter in the newspaper’s Madison Bureau. It looked like a JSOnline story, down to the same font and similar layout.

The headline: ""Dept. of Corrections considering yearly physical fitness testing.""

The item went on to say the department was considering new testing for ""security staff"" beyond what’s administered when they are hired. It even included a fake quotes from the department’s actual spokeswoman, Linda Eggert.

All of this would no doubt come as a surprise for state employees.

Many are already anxious about their jobs in the wake of a new state law pushed by Gov. Scott Walker greatly limiting collective bargaining for most public workers. And there are fitness tests at the time someone is hired. An applicant must clear a number of hurdles -- including a fitness test that consists of push-ups, sit-ups and a run. The standards vary depending on the age and gender of the applicant.

So, an authentic-looking story could well get them wondering: Are regular push-up tests coming for prison guards already on the job?

There’s only one problem.

The story wasn’t published by JSOnline.com and the Corrections Department says the claims in it aren’t true. It’s another email hoax.

Because so many people receive chain emails, PolitiFact checks them out.

PolitiFact’s national site has evaluated 100 chain emails. Of the claims, 28 were rated False and 51 were rated Pants on Fire. Some of them are items such as one claiming the federal government is going to make you get rid of your light bulbs next year (Pants on Fire). Or that members of Congress and their families are exempt from repaying student loans (likewise).

At PolitiFact Wisconsin, we looked at a chain email that -- also using a fake JSOnline story -- said Walker had hired convicted Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen to oversee a raid on the state employee retirement system to help balance the state budget. That email wound up, briefly, on a teachers union website in Little Chute before the hoax was revealed.

We rated it Pants on Fire. Anyone sensing a trend?

As for the new email, the agency first heard about it the morning of Sept. 6, 2011, when an employee from the Prairie du Chien prison contacted administrators in Madison, said Department of Corrections spokesman Tim Le Monds.

That afternoon, the agency sent an email to all employees trying to set the record straight.

""Enclosed is a ‘report’ that some of you may have received or seen. I want you to know that this report is false and has no merit or truth to it whatsoever,"" wrote corrections secretary Gary Hamblin. ""No one from the Secretary’s Office had a discussion about this topic with any reporter nor is the issue of physical fitness testing being considered.""

Hamblin tried to close the door on this issue. But the fake story was pasted into his email which suggested it had actually been published.

On Sept. 7, 2011, the secretary’s office tried again.

""To further clarify, neither the Journal Sentinel nor any of its reporter/s was involved in any way in the creation of the ‘report’ enclosed in the message,"" wrote Eggert.

The department does not know where the fake email originated and there are no plans to track down the source of the email. ""It’s a waste of time,"" Le Monds said.

Our conclusion

A fake JSOnline.com was emailed around the Department of Corrections saying that prison guards could face fitness testing. The story was never published. And the department says there are no plans for such tests. Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7F5E40>],/factchecks/2011/sep/10/chain-email/email-claims-physical-fitness-tests-will-be-requir/
"['Oregon', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Matt Wand']","
Rep. Matt Wand says using kicker money has failed to stabilize the state’s revenues
","
Correction appended: An earlier version of this item used the word ""economy"" instead of the word ""revenue."" The error does not change the ruling. 
The state’s surplus refund law, better known as the ""kicker,"" requires a refund to taxpayers if actual revenues exceed projections by at least 2 percent. The idea is to force the state to stick to a budget, but some people argue the law makes it harder to save money for bad economic times.

Last month, former state Rep. Brent Barton, a Democrat, argued we should repeal the ""kicker"" and build savings in order to improve the state’s bond rating. In response, current state Rep. Matt Wand, a Republican, argued that Oregon should leave the kicker alone and, instead, require state government to save 1 percent of its general fund dollars if it craves a piggy bank. 
""Repealing the kicker may impress some Wall Street bankers, but it'll do little to stabilize state finances and absolutely nothing to improve our economy and put people back to work,"" Wand wrote, adding: ""Every time the Legislature ‘suspended’ the kicker, most recently the corporate kicker in 2007, Salem spent every penny and failed to stabilize the state's revenues."" 
Every time? PolitiFact Oregon wanted to know how many times the kicker had been tapped, and under what circumstances. As for stabilizing revenues, we wanted to know whether kicker money was meant to do that and in how much time, especially when Oregon relies so heavily on income taxes that go up and down with the economy.

The kicker has been suspended three times since the law was approved in 1979. Legislators voted to suspend the law authorizing the personal kicker for tax year 1991 and the corporate kicker for 1993. Both times, they needed to plug financial holes due to lost revenue from 1990’s Ballot Measure 5, which curbed property taxes.

Measure 5 required state replacement of lost local school revenue at $362 million in 1991-93. That grew to $1.6 billion in 1993-95 budget.

Then Salem left the kicker alone, for the most part, until 2007, when the economy was pretty plush. Legislators, with backing from business, voted to start a ""rainy day fund"" to shelter the state should the economy sour going forward. They started with a one-time suspension of the corporate kicker, totalling $319 million.

But they didn’t get a chance to let that kicker money grow. In 2008, the recession hit. Lawmakers withdrew $225 million to balance the 2007-09 budget (which had grown to $338 million, including interest and leftovers from the previous budget period). Then they took $116 million to balance the 2009-11 budget, leaving a paltry $10 million in the pot. (Paul Warner, Oregon’s legislative revenue officer, said he expects the fund will grow to $46 million for the 2011-13 budget.)

So Wand’s not technically right about spending it all down, but we get what he’s saying. In 2007, legislators took the corporate kicker and they used most of it in the following years even while increasing taxes and fees for other state needs. Not very fiscally conscious of Salem.

Yet the ""failed to stabilize the state’s revenues"" continued to bug us. Wand dings lawmakers for taking some kicker money -- not all of it, mind you -- in times of emergency, as was the case with Measure 5. Furthermore, he criticizes the Legislature for taking corporate kicker money to start a rainy day fund, only to have the fund brutalized by a recession that continues to hurt. He was leaving out context.

After all, the bigger reason for Oregon’s revenue instability has to do with our heavy reliance on income taxes.

The kicker law just exacerbates the swings, say some economists. In a 2009 guest column in The Oregonian, University of Oregon adjunct professor and economist Tim Duy wrote that:
  
""(W)e have a ridiculous fiscal system that accentuates the peaks and troughs of the business cycle. When the economy is growing, we return hundreds of millions of dollars to taxpayers, but then find it necessary to raise taxes or reduce spending when recession hits --exactly the opposite of good policy, but the only option available under Oregon's unique ‘kicker’ law. We need to move forward with the development of a more aggressive rainy day fund. Optimally, but perhaps politically impossible, we would also reform tax policy to reduce dependence on the income tax."" 

We asked Wand what he meant by his statement. Did he blame the state’s instability on the kicker? Did he think we should never use the kicker? Did he really think the kicker was supposed to stabilize the budget?

It turns out he was responding specifically to claims that Democrats have made, that if we suspend Oregon’s kicker, ""magically the state budget will be stable and everything will be fine. And nothing could be further from the truth.""

He said, ""I’m calling foul on the other side for pretending that they’re serious about savings, and my proof of that is look at what’s happened in the past when we have suspended the kicker. The unicorns and rainbows have not appeared."" 
(For the record, Wand is not opposed to taking kicker money for savings -- so long as state government also puts aside money every year.) 
Wand is right that taking away the kicker isn’t the only way for state government to save money. Nothing has prevented the state from socking away dollars on its own. But the assertion that suspending the kicker should have stabilized revenues  -- but didn’t -- is flawed.

""These examples of when the kicker was spent are not good examples,"" said Duy, the economist. Ultimately, ""you'd want to be saving money when the economy is doing well and using that savings when the economy is doing poorly. It’s very hard to accomplish the savings when you're in a recession."" 
It’s true that the state has suspended the kicker three times, although it’s not true that the state has spent ""every penny"" in those instances. Using the kicker did not stabilize the state’s budget, but that’s largely due to an unreliable revenue base as well as extenuating circumstances: loss of revenue from a ballot measure and a recession.

The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB6C8C0>],/factchecks/2011/sep/10/matt-wand/rep-matt-wand-says-using-kicker-money-has-failed-s/
"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'History', 'Virginia', 'Bob Goodlatte']","
Goodlatte says Thomas Jefferson strongly backed a balanced budget amendment
","Almost two centuries after his death, Thomas Jefferson is often quoted by Virginia politicians espousing limited, frugal government.

So it wasn’t surprising when U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th, invoked Jefferson’s name in urging Congress to approve a balanced budget amendment and send it to states for ratification.

""This amendment isn’t my idea. It’s not even a new idea,"" Goodlatte said Sept. 3 in the Weekly Republican Address to the nation. ""Thomas Jefferson expressed strong support for it in 1798.""

Goodlatte has authored two balanced budget amendments pending in the House. Both require that spending doesn’t outpace revenues in a given fiscal year unless three-fifths of Congress signs off on the deficit spending.

We were well aware of Jefferson’s remarkable resume -- author of the Declaration of Independence and the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, governor, secretary of state, president and founder of the University of Virginia. But we had never heard that he was a father of the balanced budget amendment and wondered if that is true.

A spokeswoman for Goodlatte told us the congressman’s assertion is based on a Nov. 26, 1798 letter Jefferson sent to his friend, John Taylor.

""I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our constitution; I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our government to the genuine principles of its constitution,"" Jefferson wrote. ""I mean an additional article taking from the federal government the power of borrowing.""

Kathryn Rexrode, Goodlatte’s press secretary, said ending federal borrowing would result in a balanced budget.

Several Jefferson scholars told us there’s no doubt the former president opposed racking up national debt. But they said Jefferson’s position on federal borrowing, like much of his long life, was complicated and rife with contradiction.

Princeton University is transcribing Jefferson’s correspondence through 1809 -- shortly after Jefferson’s presidency ended -- and expects it will fill 60 volumes. At Monticello, Jefferson’s plantation, editors are compiling additional correspondence from the statesman’s political retirement to his death in 1826.

""Jefferson is a human being and he says a lot of things in the course of his very long career,"" said J. Jefferson Looney, a historian at Monticello and editor of the ""Papers of Thomas Jefferson Retirement Series.""

Looney noted that during the War of 1812, Jefferson was open to the nation incurring debt.
The evidence is a June 24, 1813 letter Jefferson wrote to U.S. Rep. John Wayles Eppes of Virginia, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee who was also the former president’s nephew and son-in-law.

Jefferson wrote that debt was acceptable as long as as it was paid off in a generation, which he calculated to be 19 years. He also suggested imposing a tax to ensure the debt was paid off within that time frame.

""I hope yourself and your committee will render the immortal service of introducing this practice not that it is expected that Congress should formally declare such a principle,"" Jefferson wrote. ""They wisely enough avoid deciding on abstract questions but they may be induced to keep themselves within its limits.""

Is this a flip-flop?

""You pick the year -- 1798, he’s for an amendment (banning federal borrowing),"" Looney said. ""In 1813 he’s saying it’s OK to borrow, but you have to borrow within certain restrictions, but don’t tie the hands of Congress by saying it’s a rule.""

Looney said Jefferson always fretted about public debt but appeared more concerned about it when his political adversaries, the Federalists, were in power.

Historians also note that as president Jefferson relied on public debt to finance one of his most famous accomplishments - the $15 million Louisiana Purchase. The deal with France bought the U.S. more than 800,000 square miles of land west of the Mississippi River.

""People often say he believed in getting rid of debt, then what happened when Louisiana came along? Of course he bought it,"" said Barbara Oberg, editor of The Papers of Thomas Jefferson published by Princeton University Press. ""It would have been silly not to. He’s a wonderful,  pragmatic statesman.""

A couple of historians told us Jefferson’s unease with public debt may have stemmed from his own financial difficulties. Monticello’s website notes that at the time of his death, Jefferson had debts totaling somewhere between $1 million and $2 million in modern dollars.

The historians also cautioned against using 18th century references and applying it to today’s debate over a balanced budget.

""I don’t think any politician, Jefferson or otherwise, at this point was presented with a balanced budget amendment as we understand that today,"" said J.C.A Stagg of the University of Virginia.

Oberg said the 1798 letter cited by Goodlatte hardly qualifies as a public call to end government debt.  After all, she said, Jefferson threw out the idea in a private letter.

Our ruling:

Goodlatte said that Thomas Jefferson ""strongly supported"" the idea of a balanced budget amendment in 1798.

The congressman cites a 1798 letter Jefferson wrote to a friend saying he would like to see a constitutional amendment ""taking from the federal government the power of borrowing."" This lends some credence to Goodlatte’s claim, although it’s a stretch to conclude that the private letter proves Jefferson ""strongly supported"" a balanced budget mandate.

Goodlatte omits that Jefferson’s thoughts on government debt evolved in later years. As president in 1803, he borrowed money to make the Louisiana Purchase. And in 1813, he wrote another private letter suggesting it is OK to run up debt so long as its paid off in a generation.

So there’s some basis to Goodlatte’s characterization of Jefferson’s view in 1798, some exaggeration and some selective interpretation. We rate the statement Half True.

"['Education', 'Florida', 'Donna Shalala']","
Donna Shalala says UM's athletes are mentioned in the same breath as Notre Dame and Stanford
","As news spread that a convicted Ponzi schemer said he plied University of Miami football players with everything from booze to prostitutes, university president Donna Shalala tried -- as best she could -- to spin the story away from the troubling allegations.

""Let us not forget who we are,"" Shalala said in a video posted on the university's website Aug. 29. ""Nationally the academic achievements of our student-athletes are mentioned in the same breath and spirit as Notre Dame and Stanford. This is because we are first and foremost an academic institution.""

Notre Dame. Stanford. And ... UM. Really?

PolitiFact Florida felt compelled to tackle (pun intended) this question about academic excellence.

Shalala relied on two sources of data to back up her claim -- graduation rates for student-athletes and a measure crafted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the NCAA, to measure the progress of student-athletes.

For the 2009-10 year, UM student-athletes had what the NCAA calls a ""graduation success rate"" of 86 percent. That means that 86 percent of student-athletes who started between 2000-03 graduated within six years. According to NCAA statistics, UM ranks 7th in the 12-school Atlantic Coast Conference (Duke and Boston College graduated 97 percent of their student-athletes, for instance) and well behind the graduation rates at Notre Dame (99 percent) and Stanford (94 percent).

The other measure Shalala cited -- specifically when it comes to the football program -- is called ""academic progress rate."" The APR measures, as its title suggests, progress -- not academic achievement; students get points for being academically eligible and staying in school. To the APR, a student-athlete who scores all C's in music therapy would ""look"" the same as one who scores A's in organic chemistry.

And by that measure, the most recent scores for the three schools' football programs are close -- 979 for UM, 977 for Stanford and 971 for Notre Dame.

That's good -- a 1,000 is a perfect score -- but not that uncommon. On the NCAA's website, we found about 28 university football programs that have APR scores between 971 and 979 and an additional 20 schools with better scores. So Notre Dame, Stanford and UM share the spotlight with Wofford, Appalachian State and the University of North Dakota.

But Shalala's pointing to a very limited source of information about student-athletes. Mark Nagel, a professor in sport management at the University of South Carolina, described the APR as a ""public relations mechanism"" created by the NCAA. 

""What APR is telling you is that the students are remaining eligible and retained on campus,"" Nagel said. ""It is not telling you their majors, educational outcomes or what they are learning.""

And the APR rates certainly don't indicate if students are, as one professor described it, taking ""rinky-dink courses."" A 2006 New York Times article showed that the Auburn University football team performed phenomenally on APR -- even finishing ahead of academically stout Duke. It turned out that many of the Auburn athletes were taking the equivalent of an independent study from the same sociology professor.

Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College economics professor who has written about the business of sports, says APR doesn't measure the quality of students' progress or learning -- just simply that they aren't dropping out.

""I would never compare the academic quality or achievement at two universities on the basis of drop-out rates,'' he said. ""It seems to me the educational process is deeper and richer and more complex. But, by the same token, the APR is not a meaningless number.""

APR also doesn't measure how rigorous (or not) the courses are or whether they are relying on tutors, Zimbalist said. 

""It's kind of shocking (Shalala) would consider APR to be a valid comparative measurement or the most important measure of academic achievement,"" he said.

(We should note that in our research we found that Stanford had some academic achievement blemishes of its own. Athletes had access to a list of classes known as easy A's such as ""Beginning Improvising"" and another in ""Social Dances of North America III."" That list has been discontinued.)

We're not the only ones to pick on Shalala's claim here -- Inside Higher Ed, an online publication, concluded that she ""engaged in some hyperbole."" 

Anyway, back to what Shalala said, which was: ""Nationally the academic achievements of our student-athletes are mentioned in the same breath and spirit as Notre Dame and Stanford."" 

This is a case where there is not a lot of evidence to back Shalala up. She cites graduation rates -- which are significantly lower for UM compared to Notre Dame and Stanford -- and the NCAA-developed ""academic progress rate."" But that measure awards points to students for remaining academically eligible and enrolled in school.

If that's your definition of ""academic achievement,"" we'd like to know where we can sign up for classes.

Nagel, the sport management professor from South Carolina, summed it up best: ""I have a sneaking suspicion that the only time those three schools are discussed in the same (breath) and spirit is within the halls of the University of Miami’s administrative offices.""

We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7E16C0>],/factchecks/2011/sep/09/donna-shalala/shalala-says-ums-athletes-are-mentionned-same-brea/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Voting Record', 'Wisconsin', 'Tommy Thompson']","
Republican Tommy Thompson says Democratic Rep. Tammy Baldwin ranks as ""most liberal"" House member
","
Until U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., announced her 2012 candidacy for the U.S. Senate, her campaign website displayed a 2006 news article that began with the words: ""Rep. Tammy Baldwin, one of the most liberal members of Congress.""

Evidently, Baldwin’s congressional re-election campaign wasn’t concerned about the candidate being cast as one of the most left-wing members of the U.S. House.

Certainly Baldwin’s critics aren’t shy about portraying her in that way.

On Sept. 6, 2011, the day Baldwin announced her run for the seat being vacated by Democrat Herb Kohl, Republican Tommy Thompson’s team weighed in. Darrin Schmitz, a consultant to the former Wisconsin governor and likely Senate candidate, issued a statement that said:

""Tammy Baldwin is a classic tax-and-spend liberal, and her ranking as the most liberal member of the House puts her clearly out of the mainstream of Wisconsin voters.""

So does Baldwin, who has served in the House since 1999, rank as its most liberal member?

As evidence, Thompson cited a 2010 ranking of House members by the National Journal, a nonpartisan political magazine and website. Baldwin tied with six other House members for the most liberal.

The rankings were based on what the journal judged to be 93 votes taken in 2010  that showed ""ideological distinctions between members."" The largest number -- 59 votes -- were on economic issues.

So in one rating system, seven House members, including Baldwin, were rated the most liberal.

Let’s look at other major rankings:

American Conservative Union

The American Conservative Union says it promotes economic growth through lower taxes and reduced government spending, as well as liberty, personal responsibility, traditional values and national security."" The organization said its 2010 rankings were based on 24 votes taken in 2010 that created a ""clear ideological distinction"" among House members.

The American Conservative Union had urged House members to vote, for example, against extending long-term unemployment benefits, for ending moratoriums on offshore drilling and against the repeal of the military don’t ask-don’t tell policy.

Baldwin’s rating: Zero on a scale of zero to 100, which the organization called a ""perfect liberalism score.""

That certainly puts Baldwin at the extreme end of the spectrum. But it’s also less of a distinction than it might appear: Baldwin was among 150 House members who received that score.

Americans for Democratic Action

Americans for Democratic Action is an organization that says it is ""committed to liberal politics, liberal policies and a liberal future."" It ranks lawmakers based on their votes on what the group considers the 20 most important votes of the year. In 2010, the group urged House members to vote for measures such as health care reform, the extension of long-term unemployment benefits and repeal of don’t ask-don’t tell.

Baldwin’s liberal rating on the 2010 list: 100 percent.

Again, this ranking marks Baldwin as an extreme liberal, but it didn’t exactly single her out. Baldwin was among 49 House members who received a perfect score.

Voteview.com

Voteview.com, a site created by political scientists, uses a complicated calculation based on patterns of how often each member of Congress votes with other members, and then plots them on a liberal-conservative spectrum. Voteview is different in that members are ranked based on the entire time they have served in the House.

Voteview’s latest rankings are for the 111th Congress -- members who served during the 2009-2010 session.

Baldwin’s ranking: 19th most liberal. 
(Note: After our item was posted, researchers with the group were able to pull out just the votes from the most recent session. Based on those votes, Baldwin would be tied for 12th most liberal.) 
Asked about Thompson’s attack, Baldwin campaign spokesman Phil Walzak dismissed the various rankings as ""just one group or organization's opinion based on its own selected criteria."" He also cited four votes that he said show Baldwin supports the middle class.

But four votes don’t go far in refuting the claim and the issue wasn’t whether Baldwin supported the middle class.

Our conclusion

Thompson says Baldwin, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2012, ranks ""as the most liberal member"" of the House of Representatives. He singled her out as being more liberal than any of the other 434 members.

One ranking puts Baldwin as the 19th most liberal. But that ranking covers her entire House career, and Thompson’s claim refers to the present.

Three other major rankings -- one liberal, one conservative and one nonpartisan -- all ranked Baldwin as being among a group of House members considered the most liberal in 2010, the most recent period available. But she was not singled out as being the most liberal in any of the rankings.

We rate Thompson’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6CC680>],/factchecks/2011/sep/09/tommy-thompson/republican-tommy-thompson-says-democratic-rep-tamm/
"['Ohio', 'Elections', 'Labor', 'We Are Ohio']","
We Are Ohio ad says Issue 2 would bar negotiations on firefighter numbers
","
The first TV commercial about the Issue 2 ballot war recently hit the airwaves. It features a firefighter talking about how his job will be more dangerous if the issue passes.

Issue 2 is the voter referendum on Senate Bill 5, the Republican-backed law passed earlier this year that restricts the collective bargaining power of Ohio’s public unions. If voters reject the issue on Nov. 8, SB 5 is overturned and will not take effect. If Issue 2 passes, the law takes effect after the election and will be applied as current collective bargaining agreements expire.

Although the 30-second commercial focuses on firefighters, SB 5 would affect about 360,000 public workers from teachers to prison guards to municipal workers.

The commercial shows a burning house and firefighters suiting up to respond. Ohio firefighter Doug Stern, as he is identified in the commercial, urges voters to vote against Issue 2 because it will endanger firefighters and the neighborhoods they are responsible for protecting.

""Issue 2 makes it illegal for us to negotiate for enough firefighters to do the job,"" Stern says.

Issue 2 is expected to be the most high-profile race on the fall ballot. Accusations of misinforming the public have flown from both sides since the law was introduced earlier this year. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the central claim of the first commercial in what will be an ongoing effort to keep both sides honest.

SB 5 is a complete overhaul of Ohio’s collective bargaining law, which originally passed in 1983.

A spokeswoman for We Are Ohio, an anti-Issue 2 political action committee that produced the commercial, pointed us to a provision in SB 5  that she said verified the ad’s claim.

The law sets new rules for what topics cannot be negotiated and specifies other topics that are negotiable only if management agrees to do so. Overall, these new rules give management significantly more power at the bargaining table.

Melissa Fazekas, a spokeswoman for We Are Ohio, said the number of firefighters on the job is among the topics that cannot be negotiated under SB 5.

Specifically, the law amends a portion of Sec. 4117.08 of the Ohio Revised Code to say ""the number of employees required to be on duty or employed in any department, division or facility of a public employer"" is a subject ""not appropriate"" for collective bargaining.

Other topics prohibited from negotiations under this section of the law include pension pickups – the practice of employers paying a share of workers’ pension contributions – and health care benefits.

But supporters of Issue 2 and SB 5 insist that workers will be able to negotiate staffing as long as management agrees to do so.

Jason Mauk, spokesman for the pro-Issue 2 group Building a Better Ohio, pointed us to other language in a different part of that same section that he says allows management to initiate talks on staffing.

The law lists ""the number of persons required to be employed or laid off"" under topics that can be negotiated at management’s discretion.

""Nothing says that employees cannot discuss staffing levels with employers,"" Mauk said.

The two sides of this argument are an example of how confusing SB 5 can be. We have two similar topics that are treated differently under the law.

One provision – ""the number of employees required to be on duty"" – is among topics prohibited from collective bargaining. The other – ""the number of persons required to be employed"" – can be discussed at management’s discretion.

The key difference between the two is the phrase ""on duty"", said Mark Sanders, president of the Ohio Association of Professional Fire Fighters.

Any negotiations related to the latter provision would only ensure, for example, that a city has a certain number of firefighters on the payroll, Sanders said. It would not cover the number of firefighters required to be on a fire engine, he said.

The distinction between the two provisions, however, would be moot if management unilaterally decides it doesn’t want to discuss staffing at all.

And Mauk said the bill is designed to give management, such as police chiefs and fire chiefs, the authority to decide staffing levels. Mauk said that is the way it is done in the private sector.

Supporters of SB 5 like Mauk say Issue 2 is needed so mayors and others in management positions can cope with tightening budgets without cutting services or laying off workers.

A key tenet of PolitiFact is that words matter. In this case, the words used in the statement were that ""Issue 2 makes it illegal for us to negotiate for enough firefighters to do the job.""

We think the natural reading of ""enough firefighters to do the job"" is how many would be needed to fight a fire -- or on duty. Scenes in We Are Ohio’s ad show firefighters responding to a call, buttressing that notion.

There is language in SB 5 that could allow negotiations on  overall staffing levels -- a point of clarification -- but only if management allows the topic to be part of negotiations.

And  there is a clear  prohibition against negotiating the number of workers ""on duty.""

"['Georgia', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Tom Graves']","
Does jet claim fly straight?
","
Like many congressional freshmen, Republican Rep. Tom Graves of Georgia is worried about the nation’s spiraling debt and how much of it is owned by China.

Graves, whose district consists of 15 northwest Georgia counties, including Forsyth, talked about the problem of deficit spending at a recent town hall meeting.

""Two days of interest we pay to China is enough to buy one joint strike fighter [jet],"" Graves told the largely receptive crowd, according to the Cumming Patch website.

Those aircraft usually cost astronomical sums of money, so we wondered whether the congressman’s math was correct. On average, does the United States really pay that much money in debt to China? Or did Graves use hyperbole to scare his town hall audience about the rapidly growing economic influence of China?

Our friends at PolitiFact Virginia did some of our homework for us. In April, they fact-checked a claim by U.S. Rep. J. Randy Forbes, R-Va., that the federal government pays China nearly $74 million a day in debt interest.

PolitiFact Virginia found U.S. Treasury Department reports that show China holds about $1.165 trillion of the national debt. In the most recent 12-month period available, the U.S. spent about $197 billion in interest payments on its debt. Since China owns about 12.8 percent of the U.S. debt, PolitiFact Virginia assumed that country received a similar percentage of the debt interest payments, which for fiscal year 2010 would total nearly $69 million a day. But since the debt increased in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, PolitiFact Virginia did some more math and determined the interest payments to China would be $74.4 million a day, which earned Forbes a True rating on its Truth-O-Meter. Two days of interest payments would total nearly $150 million.

So, the next question: How much do these jets cost?

The cost to produce a joint strike fighter jet, also known as the F-35, has caused a stir in Washington in recent months. They’re being made by Lockheed Martin, which has a plant in Marietta, and are said to be the most technologically advanced jets ever developed. The jets are being made for the Air Force, Marines and Navy. For the Marines and Navy, it will be the first time they have stealth jets, said Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 Joint Program Office.

They’re also very expensive, and some members of Congress are angry about the rising costs. Defense Department officials recently told the U.S. Senate’s Armed Services Committee that the cost for some of the initial planes ordered was 11 percent to 15 percent higher than expected.

""Disgraceful,"" tweeted U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Az., who has been critical of F-35 cost overruns.

Cost estimates are all over the place in news accounts. The most accurate estimate came from a Defense Department report that officials say was leaked to the news media a few months ago. The price to build and operate 2,443 of the jets was recently estimated to be about $93 million to $112 million apiece, according to a 2010 Pentagon report. DellaVedova did not dispute the cost estimate.

So if we take two days of interest payments, which we believe adds up to about $150 million, that total does eclipse the highest estimate for a F-35 jet, $112 million. Graves’ office estimates the total cost per jet at about $132 million, using a July report from the Congressional Research Service.

New Jersey Rep. Jon Runyan claims debt ceiling compromise links “a debt ceiling increase to spending cuts for the first time ever”
","
With a recent deal to raise the nation’s debt ceiling, U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan said he is helping to make history.

About a month after voting for the bipartisan proposal, Runyan (R-3rd Dist.) distributed a mailer highlighting some of the benefits of the legislation, known as the Budget Control Act of 2011. The mailer was posted Sept. 3 on bluejersey.com, a left-leaning blog.

According to the mailer, Runyan’s support of the bill will ""directly link a debt ceiling increase to spending cuts for the first time ever.""

Fact checkers across the country have been busy investigating the same claim from other congressmen.PolitiFact reviewed a statement from Rep. Allen West (R-Florida), and PoliGraph at Minnesota Public Radio took on comments by Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.).

As in PolitiFact’s and PoliGraph’s cases, PolitiFact New Jersey found that Runyan is wrong.

The Budget Control Act of 2011 ties debt ceiling increases to spending cuts, but that’s nothing new. In one form or another, a debt ceiling increase has been linked to spending cuts in at least four cases within the past 30 years.

Drew Fasoli, Runyan’s press secretary, acknowledged spending cuts have been tied to a debt ceiling increase in the past. He said the mailer meant to say the recent deal marked the first time that a spending cut was equal to or greater than the debt ceiling increase.

But we’re not going to look into that claim, because that’s not how the mailer was written.

""Maybe we could have done a better job explaining it further,"" Fasoli said.

First, let’s briefly explain the debt ceiling deal.

In early August, President Barack Obama reached an agreement with members of Congress to increase the debt limit for a total of between $2.1 trillion and $2.4 trillion. The legislation also would reduce the deficit by at least $2.1 trillion between 2012 and 2021, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Part of those savings comes from the following provision: if the enactment of legislation from a new committee does not achieve the requisite estimated savings by Jan. 15, 2012, automatic spending cuts totaling up to $1.2 trillion would kick in. Those spending cuts would be spread over fiscal years 2013 through 2021.

But Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, pointed to four similar cases, going back to 1985, where a debt ceiling increase was tied to spending cuts or related budget enforcement procedures. 
In 1985, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (GRH) Act was enacted as part of a nearly $175 billion increase in the debt limit. That act set targets to reduce the deficit. If those targets were not met, automatic spending cuts would be instituted through a process called sequestration.

Referring to that act, political science professor Steven Smith of Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., said in an email: ""The first time ever claim (from Runyan) is only narrowly technically correct. The debt limit increase in 1985 provided for ratcheting down the deficit, which surely required spending cuts but could have been achieved through revenue increases.""

Five years later, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990 also tied spending cuts to a debt limit increase. That legislation increased the debt ceiling by $915 billion, but also mandated spending cuts to help achieve nearly $500 billion in deficit reduction over a five-year period.

In 1997, then-President Bill Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress would reach a similar agreement with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. In addition to increasing the debt limit from $5.5 trillion to $5.95 trillion, the bill also made net reductions in direct spending of $122 billion over five fiscal years.

Just last year, when federal officials approved a $1.9 trillion increase in the debt limit, they also attached a measure known as the Statutory PAYGO Act of 2010. Under that act, if tax cuts or spending increases are not fully offset, across-the-board spending cuts would be made to a select group of mandatory programs.

All of these examples carry the same punch line: the new deal is not the first time that spending cuts have been linked to a debt ceiling increase.

""This recent August deal is nothing new,"" Peuquet said.

Our ruling

In a recent mailer, Runyan claimed the Budget Control Act of 2011 marked the ""first time ever"" that a debt ceiling increase was linked to spending cuts. But our research shows that similar connections have been made at least four times within the past three decades.

We rate the statement False.

Dukakis created jobs three times faster than Mitt Romney, says Rick Perry
","
Republican contenders for the presidential nomination Rick Perry and Mitt Romney sparred over jobs at a debate at the Reagan Library -- how many, what kind and who created them.  
The back-and-forth was full of stats and numbers, with Perry claiming his job-creation record as the Texas governor was superior to Romney's record as Massachusetts governor. 

And if that's wasn't enough, Perry said Romney's record was even worse than a Democrat's. ""Michael Dukakis created jobs three times faster than you did, Mitt,"" Perry jabbed.

We decided to fact-check whether Perry's attack was accurate. As is our usual procedure, we wanted to check both whether the number was correct and the implication that Romney's policies contributed to the outcome.

We'll begin by saying there are several different ways to count jobs, and the numbers change slightly depending on the parameters of your search. We decided to use numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

Michael Dukakis was governor for three terms, while Romney was governor for one term. (Dukakis was governor from 1975 to 1979 and from 1983 to 1991. Romney was governor from 2003 to 2007.) We could make a number of choices about how to calculate job growth by selecting different parameters, particularly whether we should look at growth on annual basis or whether we should look at when the governors took office and when they left. By some of our calculations, Dukakis created three times more jobs than Romney, and by other calculations, it was even more. 

As we researched the item more, we found an analysis published a few days before the debate by Matt Lewis of The Daily Caller. Lewis looked at different job statistics and concluded that Dukakis created jobs faster than Romney did. Using numbers from the Massachusetts Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development, Lewis found that Dukakis created an average of about 45,209 jobs per year, while Romney created an average of 12,850 jobs per year. So using those numbers, Dukakis' job creation was about three and half times Romney's.

In a follow-up to his original post, Lewis noted that the Romney campaign objected to his analysis but not because they questioned the underlying numbers. Rather, they said that Romney inherited large deficits that harmed job creation and that the unemployment rate was lower when Romney left office than when Dukakis left office. Lewis said that he believed his original analysis still had merit.

After looking at numbers from BLS, we concluded that Dukakis did have more robust job growth than Romney, and three times is a reasonable estimate, keeping in mind that one could use other reasonable estimates. We also noticed that Romney had his worst job growth during his first two years, giving creedence to the argument that his policies hadn't yet had time to take effect.

Now to our second point: Is there any evidence that Dukakis' policies led to robust job growth, while Romney's didn't? We asked the Perry campaign for evidence, but we didn't hear back. 

To pursue that issue, we spoke with Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent public policy organization. (Its board includes many business executives.)

Widmer confirmed that there was a faster rate of growth under Dukakis than Romney, but he warned that governors have little ability to create jobs in the short term. He attributed the growth under Dukakis to a growing computer industry in Massachusetts that was focused around what were then called minicomputers, computers sized between a mainframe and a personal computer.

""Massachusetts bet on the mini, while Silicon Valley bet on the PC,"" Widmer said. ""None of that had anything to do with a governor, before, after or since."" The bet on the mini didn't go so well, and job growth was dwindling even as Dukakis left office. 

And even when jobs were growing under Dukakis, people in Massachusetts didn't particularly credit his policies. ""Many business leaders were critical of Dukakis for not being more supportive of the business community and policies that they thought would be helpful. But then jobs were still created because of the outside factors,"" Widmer said.

Meanwhile, when Romney was governor, jobs were created slowly as Massachusetts pulled out of a nationwide recession. ""Again, there was little connection between that and the initiatives of Gov. Romney,"" Widmer said.

Romney himself made a similar point in the debate with Perry, saying that robust job growth in Texas can't be compared directly to job growth in Massachusetts. 

""States are different. Texas is a great state. Texas has zero income tax. Texas has a right to work state, a Republican Legislature, a Republican Supreme Court. Texas has a lot of oil and gas in the ground,"" Romney said. ""Those are wonderful things, but Governor Perry doesn't believe that he created those things.""

In ruling on this statement, Perry is correct that Dukakis did grow jobs at a faster pace than Romney. But we find little evidence that meant Dukakis was better at job creation. Rather, larger factors were at work, such as the way the computer industry in Massachusetts was developing, as well as national economic trends. So we rate Perry's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA07B80>],/factchecks/2011/sep/08/rick-perry/dukakis-created-jobs-three-times-faster-mitt-romne/

Democrats say Texas graduation rate fell to 50th under Rick Perry
","
In their attacks on Texas Gov. Rick Perry, the new front-runner for the Republican nomination for president, Democrats are taking aim at his record on education.

Ray Buckley, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, criticized Perry's record on high school graduation rates.

""Since Perry became governor, Texas has gone from 46th in the country to 50th in the population that graduates from high school,"" Buckley charged in an August 17, 2011 interview with The Telegraph of Nashua.

Buckley is not the first Democrat to take swings at Texas’ education system. U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan last month said that there were ""massive"" increases in class size under Perry. PolitiFact Texas rated that False.

But as for Buckley's claim: Does Texas rank 50th in high school graduates? And, if so, is Perry really to blame?

We hit the books.

The state numbers were easy enough to track down. N.H. Democratic officials first led us to the CQ State Rankings series, published by CQ Press. But the rankings, based on U.S. Census data, were only available back to 2005. So, we decided to go straight to the source.

The census figures show Buckley’s numbers to be slightly off but in the ballpark.

In 2000, when Perry first took office, 75.7 percent of state residents 25 or older had graduated high school, according to the Census bureau. That figure placed Texas 45th among the 50 states and Washington, D.C. (Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Virginia were lower.)

By 2009, nearly a decade later, the percentage of Texas residents with a high school diploma had increased to 79.6. But other states increased at a greater rate, leaving the Lone Star State ranking dead last.

The Census Bureau includes Washington, D.C. in its data, so Texas actually ranked 51st, though Buckley claimed it ranked 50th.

Either way, Buckley is largely correct about the numbers. But it's worth noting that the percentage increased under Perry, although the state still lost ground in the rankings because other states increased even faster.

As for the reason behind Texas’ low ranking, analysts cite a number of different factors, but few of them relate back to Perry.

Demographers and immigration experts say the state’s diversity weighs heavily on its ranking in regard to educational attainment.

With nearly 4 million immigrants, Texas boasts the country’s fourth-largest foreign-born population. And, of those immigrants over the age of 25, 46.8 percent did not have a high school diploma in 2009, according to census figures, compared to 32.3 percent for the nation.

Most immigrants, both legal and illegal, didn’t drop out from Texas schools but instead arrived in the state as adults without high school diplomas, according to Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a research organization in Washington, D.C.

""Texas has one of the less-educated immigrant populations,"" Camarota said. ""Texas and a whole series of states in the Southwest have lower educational attainment rates than they would in the absence of the immigrant population.""

Of the state’s native population, 12.9 percent did not graduate high school, according to census data provided by the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based agency that studies the movement of people, compared with 9.6 percent for the nation.

Texas’ diploma troubles aren’t simply an issue of immigration, however. The state’s deep ethnic diversity, even among Texas natives, also weighs heavily, other demographers told us. 
Nearly 40 percent of Texas residents -- about 9.5 million of the state’s 25 million people -- are Hispanic, and another 11.5 percent is African American. Of those, 26.4 percent of Hispanic residents live in poverty along with 23.1 percent of African Americans, according to census data provided by Steven Murdock, former director of the U.S. Census Bureau under President George W. Bush.

Poverty is typically a strong indicator of educational attainment, Murdock said. And that is reflected in the state’s high school dropout numbers. Figures provided by the Texas Education Agency show that 11.8 percent of African American students scheduled to graduate high school in 2010 dropped out, along with 9.1 percent of Hispanic students 3.5 percent of Caucasian students.

""Minority populations tend to have lower levels of education,"" said Murdock, who works now as director of the Hobby Center of the Study of Texas at Rice University in Houston.

""That’s not Texas specific. That’s a nation-wide problem. But, it is a big issue in Texas, which has a substantially more diverse population (than much of the rest of the country),"" he said.
 
These demographics suggest that Texas’ education troubles arise from causes other than the governor’s office. But education analysts say Perry had some responsibility for the low graduation rate.

Perry’s website credits him with increasing education funding by nearly $7 billion in the last six years. But this year alone, the governor and state lawmakers passed a budget that cut as much as $4 billion from state education funding.

This cut is only the latest in a series of reductions from Perry’s office, which has had an impact on students throughout his tenure, according to Julian Vasquez Heilig, an assistant professor of education policy at the University of Texas-Austin.

Since 2000, when Perry took office, Texas has fallen from 35th in per-pupil spending to 43rd in 2009. The state has actually increased the average per student costs during that time, moving from $6,560 per student to $8,540, according to census data provided by Vasquez Heilig. But, other states have increased their spending more dramatically, resulting in the rankings drop.

""Texas wants education on the cheap, and that’s what it’s got,"" said Vasquez Heilig, who also serves as associate director of the national University Council for Educational Administration, a national coalition of universities seeking to better prepare school leaders.

Other education analysts said Perry has some responsibility for the record of Texas schools but the state’s education troubles pre-date his time as governor.

Texas has a decades-long history of uneven and inadequate education funding that has left many poor and minority students struggling, according to Linda McSpadden McNeil, director of the Center for Education at Rice University.

""Certainly poverty is one part of it,"" McNeil said, but the problems are also caused by inadequate funding and language difficulties. ""We have a system now that actually stacks the deck against the poorest kids and the (teachers) who are devoted to teaching them.""

 Our ruling

The Democrats say Texas's ranking for high school graduates fell four spots under Perry. They are largely right about the drop, though their numbers are slightly off. The Democrats also exaggerate by blaming Perry. Although experts say he shares some responsibility, it is largely a factor of the state's demographics and history of education funding . We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCE86C0>],/factchecks/2011/sep/08/new-hampshire-democratic-party/democrats-say-texas-graduation-rate-fell-50th-unde/

Michele Bachmann says gasoline cost $1.79 a gallon when Barack Obama took office
","
During the Sept. 7, 2011, Republican presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., offered a line she has used frequently in the past: ""The day that President Obama took office, gasoline was $1.79 a gallon."" She added that ""it's entirely possible for us to get back to inexpensive energy."" 
With regular unleaded gasoline now hovering around $3.60 per gallon nationally, a number of readers wondered whether Bachmann was right on the price when Obama was inaugurated. So we looked into it. 
We turned to historical data collected by the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Energy Department. 
The interactive database offers a variety of measurements, so we’ll cite a few of them here. We’ll use the third week of January 2009 as a stand-in for Jan. 20, the day Obama was sworn in. 
Here are the average prices in several categories that week, rounded to the nearest cent: 
• Conventional retail gasoline, regular unleaded, national average: $1.83 per gallon 
• Reformulated retail gasoline, regular unleaded, national average: $1.88 per gallon 
• Gasoline retail prices, regular unleaded, national city average: $1.79 
So using one of these measures Bachmann is entirely correct and with the others she’s close. 
Of course, the national average is the most obvious way to analyze this issue, but there is usually variation by region. During the week in question, the cost of a gallon of unleaded ranged from a high of $2.00 on the west coast to a low of $1.61 in the Rocky Mountain states. 
It's also worth noting that a president's ability to affect gasoline prices is limited. ""Other than lip service, there is little any president or member of Congress can do about the price of gas, since 70 percent of the cost of a gallon is determined by the cost of crude oil,"" said John B. Townsend II, a spokesman for the mid-Atlantic region of the American Automobile Association. 
As recently as early 2009, a gallon of gasoline cost half what it cost today, which may be hard to remember, given the recent run of high prices. But it did cost that little.

Jon Huntsman says Utah was No. 1 in job creation when he was governor
","
During the Sept. 7, 2011, Republican presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman tried to burnish his economic credentials.

Taking a swipe at Texas Gov. Rick Perry, another Republican presidential candidate, Huntsman said, ""I hate to rain on the parade of the Lone Star governor, but as governor of Utah, we were the No. 1 job creator in this country during my years of service. That was 5.9 percent when you were creating jobs at 4.9 percent.""

We decided to check whether Huntsman was right -- and in a tale that only a statistical economist could love, we found that the answer is a lot more complicated than you might expect.

When we asked the Huntsman campaign for data to back up the claim, they directed us to a blog post at National Review Online, the website of the well-known conservative magazine. The item, posted June 20, 2011, compared employment statistics for several governors.

""During Huntsman’s tenure, January 2005 to August 2009, Utah had the best overall job-growth rate of any state in the nation,"" the item said. ""In that same time frame, Perry’s job-growth rate was 4.9 percent. (Minnesota Gov. Tim) Pawlenty’s job-growth rate was negative: The number of jobs in Minnesota decreased by 1.8 percent.""

At PolitiFact, we always double-check data in media reports against official statistics, so we did so here as well.

We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment statistics. We looked at the Current Employment Statistics database for each of the 50 states and subtracted the number of jobs in January 2005 from the number in August 2009.

As it happens, this period was split between an expansion (2005 through 2007) and a deep recession (2008 and 2009), so a majority of states actually lost jobs over that period. Utah was not one of the job-losing states -- but it also wasn’t No. 1 in the nation, according to this set of statistics, and it actually trailed Texas, undercutting Huntsman’s jab at Perry.

Here are the four states with the fastest employment growth over the period when Huntsman was governor:

1. Wyoming: 9.5 percent increase
2. North Dakota: 7.5 percent increase
3. Texas: 6.5 percent increase
4. Utah: 4.8 percent increase

So Huntsman’s claim gets a False, right? Not so fast.

When we showed our math to the Huntsman camp, they stood by their numbers. They sent us to a page for the state of Utah on the BLS website that backed up the claim Huntsman made during the debate -- the number of jobs in Utah rose by 5.9 percent over the period. Using the equivalent pages for the other three states, we found that Utah exceeded them all -- Texas grew by 4.9 percent, as Huntsman indicated, while Wyoming grew by 4 percent and North Dakota grew by 3 percent.

Using these figures, Huntsman was correct. So what gives?

When we checked with the BLS, a spokesman explained that the way we calculated the numbers and the way the Huntsman camp calculated the numbers are different because the numbers come from different data sets. The data we used come from the Current Employment Statistics, a monthly study of the payroll data at 400,000 businesses, whereas the Huntsman campaign was using data from the Current Population Survey, which is based on a survey of about 60,000 households.

Is one of these data set preferred in this context? The BLS’s answer is yes -- and the preferred method is not the one used by the Huntsman campaign.

""BLS uses changes in the payroll survey to describe job gain or loss,"" said spokesman Gary Steinberg.

One additional observation, which won’t affect our rating, but which we think is worth pointing out: Utah’s job growth during Huntsman’s tenure didn’t keep pace with the state’s population growth.

Utah’s estimated population grew by 11.4 percent during the Huntsman era, more than twice the rate of job growth as measured by the Current Employment Statistics data. Texas’ population growth over that period (8.7 percent) also outpaced its job growth. However, in the two smaller states, job growth did outpace population growth -- North Dakota, with a population increase of 1.8 percent, and Wyoming, with a population increase of 7.5 percent.

Then again, it’s also worth noting that 34 states lost jobs between January 2005 and August 2009, so any increase in jobs is noteworthy.

Our ruling

Huntsman’s campaign is able to point to government data to support its position that Utah was the No. 1 job creator in the U.S. during Huntsman’s tenure, and we see no evidence that they cherry-picked the data. Still, the BLS itself considers the data set used by the campaign to be less appropriate for the kind of comparison Huntsman is making, and, using the proper data set, Utah is fourth -- pretty high, but not first, as Huntsman said. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC784DC0>],/factchecks/2011/sep/08/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-says-utah-was-no-1-job-creation-when-/

NRSC blasts Brown for standing by Obama, his jobs record and debt increases
","
If the state of the nation is determined in any way by the president, those who stand with the president are destined to share credit or blame. Fair or not, that’s how political messages are being framed for the 2012 elections.

We’ve see few better examples than what follows from the National Republican Senatorial Committee. After noting that U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio won office in 2006 saying he wanted to pursue sound economic policies, the Republican committee said in a news release on Aug. 23:

""However, as Senator Brown has stood side-by-side with President Obama on virtually every major issue, including all of his major spending proposals, he and his fellow Democrats in Washington have presided over the most rapid increase in the debt over the last 2.5 years and they are on track to have the worst jobs record in the modern era.""

That’s a mouthful. Yet broken down into components, each part of the claim can be checked. And because this rap against Brown will be heard again and again over the next 14 months, PolitiFact Ohio thought it was worthwhile to do the checking now.

So the components, in order:

 Brown ""has stood side by side with President Obama on virtually every major issue, including all of his major spending proposals.""

Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the NRSC (an arm of the Republican Party), cited as major issues the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the economic stimulus bill; the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010; and the debt-hike bill of August 2011, which lifted the $14.3 trillion ceiling on government borrowing.

Those certainly are big. Obama pushed for passage and Brown voted yes on each one, as did Senate and House majorities.

Brown’s communications director, Meghan Dubyak, notes that the senator and president have disagreed on some big issues, too, such as carbon dioxide emission limits on factories and coal-burning power plants,  a speedier withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, and foreign trade.  

Were these major issues?

Our dictionary (Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate) defines major as greater in importance, or notable or conspicuous in effort and scope. The carbon caps were a significant issue in House of Representatives races last year in Ohio. But the stimulus and health care bill’s were Obama’s masterpieces, even if their final versions represented compromise. These, and the economy, have defined the Obama presidency.

Brown ""and his fellow Democrats have presided over the most rapid increase in the debt over the last 2.5 years.""

The debt has shot up from $10.626 trillion when Obama entered office to $14.622 trillion on Aug. 30, according to the Treasury Department’s ""Debt to the Penny"" database. In raw dollars, that $4 trillion increase is the most rapid rise in debt under any president, according to CBS News, which was one of the NRSC’s sources for the claim. Note the word ""rapid,"" because it’s important here. Total debt during President George W. Bush’s presidency rose by $4.9 trillion, according to the Treasury Department, but that was over the course of eight years. Obama has been in office less than three years.

But a dollar today is not worth what it was in, say, 1940, so we wondered about the rate of increase. We turned to the Office of Management and Budget’s historical debt tables and took out a calculator for additional perspective. Measured by rate of change, the gross federal debt has grown by 38 percent during the 2.5 years of Obama’s presidency.

That is not a historical record  Consider a one-year change during World War II, from the end of 1942 to the end of 1943: The gross debt rose 80 percent from $79.2 billion to $142.6 billion. It went up by another 43 percent the next year.

That was debt from a world war, of course, an extraordinary time.

Before moving on, it’s important to note one more piece of context. The NRSC did not say specifically that all the current debt was Obama’s and Brown’s fault. The statement was simply that Brown and fellow Democrats have ""presided"" over the rise, which the NRSC says means that Democrats voted to let the debt rise that high, approving debt-ceiling hikes like the controversial one that passed in August.

Brown’s spokeswoman says she reads that to mean the NRSC is blaming Brown for the underlying policies and programs that drove up the debt, and we agree that the NRSC makes that implication. PolitiFact has noted a number of times that the Obama administration inherited debt from Bush, the result of major tax cuts, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a costly Medicare prescription drug benefit, and a recession. The debt then grew under Obama with the stimulus, the continuation of the wars and tax cuts, and an economy that still threatens to flat-line. Both parties say if only their policies were followed, the nation would ease out of this mess. We don’t claim universal wisdom but, as we have observed before, there’s blame and credit all around.

Brown and Obama ""are on track to have the worst jobs record in the modern era.""

There are several ways to weigh this claim. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, which the NRSC used, show job losses of 2.37 million from January 2009, the month Obama entered office, through July 2011, the most recently recorded month. But since Bush was still president for the first 19 days of January 2009, and the nation was already losing 600,000 to 800,000 jobs a month at that point, some claim it is fairer to start the measurement in February 2009, Obama’s first full month in office. That puts the job losses during Obama’s presidency so far at 1.64 million.

Is this the worst in the modern era?

The NRSC points to the Washington Post’s ""Fact Checker"" column  for backup here. The Post weighed similar claims made by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Gov. Rick Perry about Obama, and wrote, ""When Romney made his statement, both Ronald Reagan and Obama were tied for the first two years of their presidency — a decline of about 2.3 percent in the number of people employed. The economy, however, really started to pick up in Reagan’s third year, while it has flagged under Obama, so for the first 2 ½ years, Obama’s record is now worse: a decline of about 1.4 percent under Obama, versus 0.5 percent under Reagan.""

The comparison can change with each successive month. But the NRSC allowed for some wiggle room by saying Obama and Brown are ""on track"" for a horrible jobs record.

So is the NRSC right?

As the Post noted, it is foolish to blame Obama for every one of those job losses, since the nation was already bleeding jobs when he got elected. We’ll go a step further: A single senator represents one vote out 100, and hardly has power to control job losses. He can, however, support policies, and sometimes his single vote matters.

Brown cast a crucial final vote that allowed the stimulus bill to pass, returning to Washington on a White House-provided plane on Feb. 13, 2009, from visitation in advance of his mother’s next-day funeral. A number of economists say that as bad as the economy got, more jobs would have been lost had it not been for the stimulus. That is not to say all economists agree, nor is it to argue that Obama and Congress have or haven’t handled the economy effectively. It is merely noting a single senator’s role, since the NRSC assigns Brown blame.

Going back to each part of the claim, then, the NRSC is correct on the highlights when it says Brown has stood side by side with Obama on virtually every major issue. But it overlooks energy -- a major issue in Ohio in 2010, though potentially less so in 2012, and one on which Brown took a different position than the president.

It is correct in a narrow way when it says that Brown and Obama ""presided"" over the most rapid rise in debt in 2 ½ years, but that claim ignores much greater rises in the rate of growth during the 1940s, as well as the reason for some of the debt.

As for being on track for the wost jobs record in the modern era, Obama may be headed for that ignominious distinction, but a single legislator generally lacks that kind of power.

Put together, this compound claim leaves out important details and context. On the Truth-O-Meter, it merits a rating of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC717EC0>],/factchecks/2011/sep/08/national-republican-senatorial-committee/nrsc-blasts-brown-standing-obama-his-jobs-record-a/

Former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean claims Homeland Security officials must report to about 100 congressional panels
","
People look at former Gov. Tom Kean in disbelief when he says the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reports to about 100 congressional committees and subcommittees.

Kean, the former head of the 9/11 Commission, received the same reaction from radio host Brian Lehrer on Aug. 30 when discussing counter-terrorism efforts as the country approaches the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

During the WNYC broadcast from Montclair State University, Lehrer asked Kean about a May 2010 article on NJ.com, in which Kean is quoted as saying ""Homeland Security spends way too much of its time reporting to the 100 congressional subcommittees that claim some type of jurisdiction.""

Lehrer asked Kean, ""Is it really a hundred or were you just kind of using an expression?""

Kean responded: ""I wish I was. No, it’s about a hundred…Believe it or not, if you can imagine this, let’s say you’re (U.S. Homeland Security Secretary) Janet Napolitano and you’ve been given a job of running Homeland Security. In other words, protecting all of us.

""And all of sudden, you find out you’re reporting to a hundred different committees and subcommittees in (the) United States Congress. And you’re spending at least a third of your time preparing testimony or testifying, you and your top deputies. That’s a third of your time you’re not spending protecting us. This is dysfunctional.""

That may be dysfunctional, but it’s also true. PolitiFact New Jersey discovered Kean was right -- Homeland Security must report to 108 congressional committees and subcommittees, according to the department.

Between Jan. 1 and Aug. 26, Homeland Security officials testified at 120 hearings and provided about 1,809 briefings to congressional offices, according to department records.

Napolitano also has expressed concern with her department’s level of congressional oversight.

""This often results in our principals and their staff spending more time responding to congressional requests and requirements than executing their mandated homeland security responsibilities,"" Napolitano wrote in an April 2010 letter to U.S. Rep. Peter King (R-NY).

The number of congressional eyeballs on Homeland Security operations has been subject to continued criticism in the years since the department was formed. Created slightly more than a year after Sept. 11, Homeland Security combined all or part of 22 different federal departments and agencies.

According to its July 2004 report, the 9/11 Commission recommended reforming congressional oversight of Homeland Security, which was then answering to 88 committees and subcommittees. A few months later, a report from a group of former legislators and other individuals noted that oversight of the U.S. Department of Defense was much different.

""In comparison, the Department of Defense, with a budget that is more than ten times greater than DHS, reports to only 36 committees and subcommittees in the House and the Senate,"" according to that December 2004 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies and Business Executives for National Security.

Following the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and another federal panel, Congress took ""a few incremental steps,"" such as forming the House Homeland Security Committee, according to a December 2008 report from the Commission on the Prevention of WMD Proliferation and Terrorism.

But that report said ""the creation of these new committees (and subcommittees) did nothing to streamline the number of congressional panels to which DHS must respond.""

More criticism of Homeland Security’s oversight came as recently as last week, when Kean and other members of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s National Security Preparedness Group -- a follow-up to the 9/11 Commission -- issued a ""report card"" on the status of the 9/11 Commission’s recommendations.

That report card said ""too many committees have concurrent and overlapping jurisdiction. This is a recipe for confusion.""

King, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, pledged in a Sept. 1 press release to continue working with House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and other House leaders to reform congressional oversight of Homeland Security.

The ruling

As unbelievable as it may sound to his listeners, Kean accurately states that Homeland Security answers to about 100 congressional committees and subcommittees. It’s a level of oversight that has attracted the criticism of various entities and the Homeland Security Secretary herself.

We rate the statement True.
