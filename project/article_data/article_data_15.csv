Paul Ryan says a dozen 'Obamacare' taxes hit middle-class Americans
","
During the Sept. 30, 2012, edition of Fox News Sunday, Paul Ryan took a shot at Barack Obama for raising taxes.

""We don't think that imposing new taxes on anybody is a good idea. Don't forget, Chris, the only person running for president who's proposing higher taxes is President Obama. … ""

Chris Wallace, the host, then interjected, ""Because he would end the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy.""

Ryan continued, ""Yeah, tax rates -- he already passed all these Obamacare taxes. About a dozen of them hit middle-income taxpayers, breaking that promise. He's proposing a massive tax increase on job creators in January.""

PolitiFact has already given Obama a Promise Broken for saying, ""I can make a firm pledge. Under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.""

But we hadn’t checked this specific claim, so we’ll do that here.

Are they taxes?

When we asked a Ryan spokesman for the taxes he was including, he referred us to a Web page put together by the House Ways and Means Republican staff. The list of tax increases in Obama’s health care law is pretty similar to a list of 19 that we published in January in a check of a claim by the Romney campaign.

The Ways and Means list marks the tax increases that affect ""middle-income taxpayers"" with an asterisk. We’ll list those 12 provisions here, with a brief summary of what they would do. As you’ll see, many of these are new taxes, some of them primarily hit the middle-class, others hit certain people within the middle class (along with other people not in the middle class), and others are debatable.

(1) Imposing an annual fee on manufacturers and importers of branded drugs, based on each company’s share of the total market. It took effect on Jan. 1, 2011.

(2) A 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. This tax is narrowly targeted at tanning bed users, but it is still a tax. This took effect July 1, 2010.

(3) Annual fee levied on health insurance providers, based on each company’s share of the total market. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.
 
(4) A 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.

(5) Limiting the amount taxpayers can deposit in flexible spending accounts to $2,500 a year. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.
 
(6) Raise the 7.5 percent adjusted gross income floor for the medical expenses deduction to 10 percent. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.
 
(7) Impose a fee on insured and self-insured health plans to fund the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.

(8) Increase the tax on distributions from a health savings account or an Archer medical savings account that are not used for qualified medical expenses. Already in effect.

(9) A tax penalty on companies with more than 50 employees that do not offer ""adequate"" health insurance coverage for their employees. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2014.
 
(10) A mandate for individuals to buy health insurance, with limited hardship exceptions. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2014.

(11) A 40 percent excise tax on employer-provided ""Cadillac"" health insurance plans costing more than $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2018.

(12) Increased penalty for purchasing disallowed products with health savings account. Already in effect.
 
In our prior review of Obama’s 19 tax increases, we relied on this operational definition, offered by Joseph D. Henchman of the Tax Foundation: ""Taxes have the primary purpose of raising revenue for general government. Fees have the primary purpose of raising revenue for a specific benefit to the payer. Penalties have the purpose of imposing criminal sanction, and any revenue generation is incidental.""

Under this definition, along with our discussions with tax experts, we feel comfortable that Ryan, at the very least, has a strong case for eight tax increases in Obama’s health care bill. (See Nos. 1 through 8 on our list.) Three of these have already taken effect, and the other five are set to take effect in about three months.

Categorizing No. 9 and No. 10 -- the employer and individual mandates -- is tricky. The question of whether the individual mandate is a tax was at the center of the Supreme Court’s decision that upheld the law this past summer. Shortly after the justices’ decision came down, we ruled that Romney was Mostly True when he characterized the Supreme Court decision as saying the individual mandate ""is a tax.""

However, what kept it from a full True rating was the view expressed by several legal experts that the court ruled that the mandate acts like a tax, or is analogous to one, but not that it is one -- a small linguistic distinction, but an important legal one. These two, in other words, could go either way.

No. 11, the ""Cadillac tax,"" has two problems. First, it’s not scheduled to take effect for another five years. More importantly, there is evidence that a significant share of the revenue from this provision may come not from the penalty itself, but from companies shifting their compensation from health coverage (which is not taxed) to wages (which is taxed).

Jonathan Gruber, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has provided health care policy advice to both Obama and Romney during his governorship of Massachusetts, estimated this using Joint Committee on Taxation data for an early version of the health care bill. He found that penalty revenues would total $201 billion from 2013 to 2019, compared to wage increases of $313 billion.

""If paying higher wages instead of paying for health benefits is a tax increase, then the definition of tax increase is being stretched beyond recognition,"" said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

Finally, No. 12 does not strike us as a tax at all.

No. 12 -- excluding the costs for over-the-counter drugs not prescribed by a doctor from being reimbursed tax-free through a flex spending plan or medical savings account -- strikes us as more like the kind of decision made by regulators than lawmakers responsible for writing the tax code. Lots of purchases still qualify, and plan participants can simply purchase other items to get reimbursed by their plan.

Do they ""hit middle-income taxpayers""?

For the most part, yes -- but not exclusively.

First, we should note that not all of these taxes are imposed directly on individuals. Some are taxes on health insurance companies, drug companies or medical device manufacturers. We’re making the assumption here, as many economists do, that these taxes are ultimately passed on to the customer through higher prices, rather than absorbed by the company.

Second, Ryan has excluded a number of other tax provisions in the health care law that are clearly not aimed at middle-class taxpayers, such as taxes that only hit earners above a certain income level, or those aimed at health-insurance CEO compensation. Most of the rest, we think, will hit some, or even many, members of the broad middle-class.

However, it’s worth noting that some of these taxes are narrowly focused. Most people use some brand-name drugs or have private health insurance. But someone who doesn’t use tanning booths won’t get hit by the tanning tax, and those who don’t have medical savings accounts won’t get hit by other new tax hikes. Ryan’s language suggests that a typical middle-class taxpayer is getting hit by a dozen new taxes; in most cases the actual number of new taxes will be smaller.

Our ruling

Ryan said Obama ""already passed all these Obamacare taxes. About a dozen of them hit middle-income taxpayers.""

We find that only eight of these measures are taxes, and in some cases the taxes are imposed on health insurance companies, drug makers and health device manufacturers, not on individual taxpayers. He can make a less-persuasive case for another three measures actually being tax increases. Finally, there will be a substantial variation in how many new taxes affect the middle class. The typical person will not be paying anywhere close to a dozen new taxes. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971BC1C0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/02/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-dozen-obamacare-taxes-hit-middle-cl/

Atlanta councilman targets repeat panhandling offenders
","
In many metropolitan areas, panhandling has long been a problem for local officials looking to balance a positive city experience for tourists with humanely treating their less fortunate residents.

The two agendas came together in the city of Atlanta last week when the mayor and the City Council collaborated on a problem-solving plan aimed at aggressive panhandling. They agreed to define and strengthen the city’s rules against that type of solicitation and set jail time of 30 and 90 days for repeat convictions.

The plan followed an initial proposal, sponsored by Councilman Michael Julian Bond, that would have allowed up to 180 days in jail for a conviction.

""The sentence should act as a deterrent,"" Bond, chairman of the council’s Public Safety Committee and the ordinance sponsor, said in an article by the Atlanta Business Chronicle about the initial amendment, which the council approved Sept. 17 but the mayor vetoed.

During the Sept. 17 council meeting, the Business Chronicle wrote that Bond cited statistics showing that almost 400 arrests in the city last year for panhandling-related offenses involved just 78 suspects, an indication that the same people were panhandling over and over.

With so many arrests, we questioned whether such a small number of people could be responsible for all the offenses. What data did Bond use to make the statement, and was the recidivist claim truly indicative of Atlanta’s aggressive panhandling problem?

Bond made a similar claim in an August 9, 2012, guest column he penned for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. At that time, Bond wrote, ""[S]ince last July, Atlanta police officers have made 279 aggressive panhandling arrests. Seventy-eight people were responsible for over 200 of these arrests — which mean some 75 percent of aggressive panhandling violations are due to less than 80 individuals.""

Atlanta’s new ordinance expands the definition of aggressive solicitation by prohibiting someone from continuing to ask for money after he or she has been told ""no."" It also prohibits touching during panhandling. A second conviction for aggressive panhandling requires the violator to serve a minimum of 30 days in jail; a third violation merits 90 days in jail.

We checked with Bond’s office about the source for its statistics. The numbers used in the statements were taken from two sources: the Atlanta Department of Corrections and the Municipal Court of Atlanta. Bond’s staff narrowed the court data of arrests between 2005 and July 2012 for panhandling-related offenses. Using just arrests from July 2011 through July 2012, staff then hand-counted the offenses and repeat offenders.  

The challenge in evaluating the claim comes with Atlanta’s current laws. As it stands, Atlanta does not have a specific aggressive panhandling ordinance. It does have a commercial solicitation ordinance, but no one has been arrested or prosecuted under it since it was passed in 2005. 

Instead, most aggressive panhandlers had been charged with begging/solicitation by accosting/force, according to police.

For its analysis, Bond’s office primarily used data on the begging/solicitation by accosting/force charge. Using that data does produce the statistics Bond cited. But because Bond did not specify in his statement which panhandling-related offenses he included, the analysis could change based on the data handler and the offenses selected. The court provided Bond’s office with data about a half-dozen charges that could reflect solicitation or aggressive panhandling. 

Overall, Bond’s analysis of the recidivist problem of aggressive panhandling is legitimate, according to experts who have studied the issue.

""These are the types of numbers that we are seeing,"" said Michael Scott, director of the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing, a community issue problem-solving think tank based at the University of Wisconsin Law School. His organization did a similar study of chronic nuisance offenders in Madison, Wis., and found the same phenomenon.

""It’s a small percentage of people that are the chronic problems, and it’s also notable that many of these people are not homeless but seem to be professional panhandlers,"" Scott said. ""… It’s a relatively small number of people that are creating the most problems for police, local officials and passers-by.""

So, is Atlanta Councilman Bond correct in his statement that 78 offenders were responsible for almost 400 arrests in the city last year for panhandling-related offenses? His assessment of the repeat offender aggressive panhandling problem appears accurate. But the varying charges that can make up panhandling-related offenses are not uniform and can change based on the situation. By using certain sets of public safety data, the statement can be correct, but shifting the range of offenses can change the numbers. Because of this possibility, we rate Bond’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D64140>],/factchecks/2012/oct/02/michael-julian-bond/atlanta-councilman-targets-repeat-panhandling-offe/

Anti-tax group says Obama's stimulus led to jobs in China, not U.S.
","
Back in the spring, jobs and jobs alone seemed the core issue in the presidential race. Since then, the menu of issues has become longer, but a recent flyer from Americans for Tax Reform, a leading anti-tax group, seeks to put jobs front and center once again.

The flyer appeared in mailboxes in New Hampshire and asks, where did the stimulus money go? A photo of President Barack Obama superimposed above a sprawling map of China in fire engine red provides an answer. Below the fold, an iconic photo of Mao Zedong is set against a newspaper headline ""NH has lost more jobs to China than any other state.""

Inside, the text reads ""The stimulus was intended to create ‘green’ American jobs. But the Obama administration funneled close to $2 billion to overseas firms. A Democratic
Senator said this would create thousands of jobs in China.""

There is a lot to unpack here but the gist of it comes down to the assertion that about $2 billion in ""green"" stimulus money went to foreign companies, with particular benefits for China at the expense of American workers. That’s a claim that we can check.

Foreign wind and solar suppliers

Americans for Tax Reform cites the work of the Investigative Reporting Workshop, a project of American University headed by investigative journalists. In February, 2010, the workshop wrote that it had found that the largest stimulus program to develop alternative energy had handed out $2.1 billion for wind, solar and geothermal power and of that, 79 percent went to companies based overseas.

We dug further and found some reports that Americans for Tax Reform missed but that bolster its claim. A later study from the workshop estimated the amount that had gone to overseas firms had reached nearly $2.4 billion. Later still, about a year after the first report, the lead author again updated his findings. The journalist, Russ Choma, noted that ""most of the jobs that were created, in the United States at least, were short-term construction jobs.""

""Since the bulk of the companies that received the money were foreign,"" Choma continued, ""and the bulk of the equipment (like wind turbines) were purchased from foreign companies, who mostly do their production overseas, very few of the high-skill, high-pay manufacturing jobs that green energy development can bring ended up in the United States.""

A study by the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the domestic portion on wind projects ranges from 48 percent to 66 percent of the total investment. For large solar projects, the domestic portion falls in the 42 percent to 71 percent range.

 A complicated jobs picture

Those wide ranges tell us that connecting taxpayer dollars to American jobs is not simple. Some foreign companies have American subsidiaries. Some American firms import large components.

The people who have tried get a handle on this have looked at the two main programs the government used to build the renewable energy sector. The biggest program, called Section 1603, subsidized energy producers. It paid the project developers 30 percent of the total project cost after an installation was complete. So far, Section 1603 has cost about $14 billion.

The smaller program, Section 48C, also provided a 30 percent subsidy but was focused on manufacturing. It helped companies that built or expanded manufacturing capacity in the U.S.. The final cost for 48C was $2.3 billion.

Teasing out the ways that Section 1603 money worked its way through the economy is tricky. The reporter cited by Americans for Tax Reform spoke about his own uncertainty after months of research into wind power.

""I can't say how many of the turbines built by American manufacturers were overseas,"" Choma said, ""and how many of the turbines built by foreign manufacturers were built here.""

The case of the Danish firm Vestas shows the challenge when dealing with foreign-based firms. Vestas supplied over 1,800 turbines in the U.S. between 2009 and 2011, or about 15 percent of the total added in those years. On the power production side, the Section 1603 subsidies for the turbines alone would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But Vestas also received nearly $52 million through the government’s program to boost manufacturing.

Those dollars ended up in Colorado for the construction of American subsidiary plants, Vestas Nacelles, Vestas Blades, and Vestas Towers. A declining wind industry has led to layoffs but at last count, the Danish firm employed about 1,700 workers in those plants, with about 5,000 workers statewide tied to the wind industry.

""This is insourcing,"" said Peter Kelley, spokesman for the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group. ""It’s important to draw foreign investment that creates jobs here in the U.S.""

Tracking the jobs for a domestic company is no easier. GE is the nation’s largest supplier of wind turbines. The Connecticut-based firm is providing the turbines for a wind farm in Alaska. GE might be an American company but the project includes blades made in Brazil and towers from China. On paper, it might look like stimulus money would stay in the country but in fact, not all of it would.

The most detailed estimate of the total number of American jobs created through the 1603 program comes from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. In a 2012 report, it found that from 2009 to 2011, spending on wind and solar produced some 57,000 to 80,000 jobs each year in construction, manufacturing and ongoing operations. These are the jobs that remain after you subtract the dollars that went overseas.

Importantly, the total earnings of American workers tied to these projects fell in the range of $9.5 billion to $14.3 billion. If these numbers are right, they tell us the low end of that estimate is more than the cost of the 1603 program, about $8.7 billion, during those years. This might be expected since 70 percent of the project costs were covered by private money.

 The China factor

The flyer from Americans for Tax Reform casts China as a major beneficiary of stimulus spending. While Chinese firms have certainly received some contracts, they do not seem to have played a major role. Their biggest place in the American renewable energy marketplace is in solar.

China has about half of the American photovoltaic market, according to Recharge News, an online industry magazine. In 2011, that was worth about $2.8 billion to Chinese manufacturers.

Subsidies for the solar industry through the 1603 program amount to about 20 percent of all spending. Wind accounts for about 70 percent of the dollars.

In wind, China is a negligible player. Of over 12,000 turbines installed under the 1603 program by 2011, Chinese firms had a role in six -- five in Texas and one in Iowa. This according to the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group.

For the curious, here is the national breakdown for the number of turbines installed in the U.S.from 2009 to 2011, according to the American Wind Energy Association and the Congressional Research Service:

United States - GE, Clipper - 49 percent
Germany - Siemens, RePower, Nordex -15 percent
Denmark - Vestas - 15 percent
Spain - Gamesa - 7 percent
India - Suzlon - 6 percent
Japan - Mitsubishi - 6 percent
All others - 2 percent

Our ruling

The Americans for Tax Reform flyer said the Obama administration funneled about $2 billion in ""green"" stimulus money to foreign companies, with particular benefits for China.

On the dollars, the claim understates the amount that went to foreign owned companies. It was certainly more than $2 billion, which would bolster the group’s claim.

But the flyer offers a very selective picture of what the stimulus did for American workers..

The distinction between domestic and foreign companies and the impact of that on jobs is unclear. And while the stimulus did help pay for high-skilled jobs overseas, it also leveraged thousands of jobs in the U.S. and produced earnings greater than the amount of money spent by the government. Money did leave the country, but not with the impact the flyer presents.

Regarding China, the flyer exaggerates the benefits for that nation. China stood to gain from spending on solar power, and it is hard to see how it wouldn’t have collected millions of taxpayer dollars. But solar represented about a fifth of the stimulus subsidies. The wind projects accounted for 70 percent and in wind, China played a tiny role. The countries that gained the most overall were European.

The statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DE6140>],/factchecks/2012/oct/01/americans-tax-reform/anti-tax-group-says-obamas-stimulus-led-jobs-china/

Ad says Obama defied China to save tire-making jobs at home, Romney criticized
","
One skirmish in the heated presidential race centers on this: Who’s tougher on China?

The Obama campaign has released an ad saying the president held firm against China in a trade decision, to the benefit of American tire manufacturers.

""When a flood of Chinese tires threatened a thousand American jobs, it was President Obama who stood up to China and protected American workers,"" a narrator says as images from manufacturing plants flash on the screen. ""Mitt Romney attacked Obama's decision … said standing up to China was ‘bad for the nation and our workers.’""

It concludes with the line, ""How can Mitt Romney take on the cheaters when he’s taking their side?""

We’re checking whether Obama saved 1,000 American tire-making jobs and whether Romney criticized him for it. In addition, we discovered ample analysis of Obama’s action that calls into question whether it protected some workers but harmed others.

The background

The United States and China became permanent, normal trading partners in 2001, after China joined the World Trade Organization. As a condition of joining, China agreed to a provision in law that lets the U.S. government determine whether a product from China is being imported in such increased quantities that it causes ""market disruption"" to domestic producers.

In the years following that agreement, several petitions were filed under the provision, called Section 421. But President George W. Bush rejected the petitions on the reasoning that any limitations on Chinese products would be filled in by other foreign exporters and American companies would not ultimately benefit.

A Section 421 petition is what brought the tire question to Obama’s desk.

In 2009, the United Steelworkers sought relief from a surge in Chinese tire imports that the union said had cost more than 5,000 U.S. jobs since 2004. A panel with the U.S. International Trade Commission heard the case and determined that ""certain passenger vehicle and light truck tires from the People’s Republic of China are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities or under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market disruption to the domestic producers of like or directly competitive products.""

The panel recommended a three-year tariff, of 55 percent in the first year, 45 percent in the second year and 35 percent in the third year. Obama did impose a tax, albeit a lighter one of 35 percent, 30 percent and 25 percent over three years. It was the first time a president approved Section 421 relief on imports from China. China appealed the tariff to the WTO but lost. It expires this month.

A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that the tariffs saved as many as 1,200 domestic jobs. The study’s lead author, Gary Clyde Hufbauer, served as deputy assistant secretary for international trade and investment policy under President Jimmy Carter. He has written extensively about international trade.

What Romney said

The Obama campaign cited three instances of Romney criticizing Obama’s move.

The first is a video, unearthed by the New Republic, of Romney speaking at the conservative group Foreign Policy Initiative in September 2009, the month Obama imposed the tariffs.

Romney said these kinds of protections just encourage lower productivity.

""The tire workers of America look at these tires coming in from China and say this is not good for me. ... But if that’s what their response is, my experience is over time, they will lose out slowly but surely. As they protect their lack of productivity with barriers, they will become less and less competitive, the foreign guys will get more and more volume, more and more successful, they’ll become more and more productive. The domestic guys get less and less productive, less and less competitive, until finally even the tariff can’t hold them out and the foreign products come flooding into the marketplace and the domestic guys are gone. So putting barriers up, trying to put walls up, in my opinion is a defeating strategy and will yield ultimate decline and collapse.""

In his 2010 book, No Apology, Romney wrote that action by the government to protect individual industries should be rare and temporary.

""President Obama’s action to defend American tire companies from foreign competition may make good politics by repaying unions for his support of their campaign, but it is decidedly bad for the nation and our workers. Protectionism stifles productivity,"" he wrote.

Finally, in a policy memo, Romney’s policy director Lanhee Chen also characterized Obama’s intervention as little more than a favor to unions that backed his campaign.

""What message does it send the Chinese when President Obama takes protectionist action against China on behalf of Big Labor, undermining free trade principles for political gain? The Obama campaign has repeatedly held out its Section 421 action against Chinese tires as an example of President Obama’s supposedly tough China policy.""

Did the tariff protect jobs?

It’s clear to us that the claims in the ad are substantially accurate. Obama did push back against China to protect American tire manufacturing jobs, and Romney did criticize him.

But Romney wasn’t alone, and we think it’s worth examining the real effect of the tariffs on American jobs. Some pro-trade groups tell a different side of the story than the ad.

The U.S.-China Business Council, a private organization comprised of companies that do business with China, said the tariff did succeed in lowering Chinese imports, as expected, but the vacuum wasn’t filled by American producers.

""We’re still importing a lot of tires from Indonesia, Taiwan and Mexico,"" said communications director Marc Ross. ""It just shifted supply chains.""

What’s more, the council said job gains for tire makers were more likely due to the burgeoning economic recovery and improved outlook for the auto industry, more so than the tariff.

The Peterson Institute study, mentioned above, did attribute 1,200 tire jobs to the tariff, but found there were other employment casualties.

""The additional money that U.S. consumers spent on tires reduced their spending on other retail goods, indirectly lowering employment in the retail industry,"" the authors wrote.

The fallout? ""On balance, it seems likely that tire protectionism cost the U.S. economy around 2,531 jobs, when losses in the retail sector are offset against gains in tire manufacturing.""

As for those higher prices, the Peterson study said consumers paid an extra $1.1 billion for tires in 2011 because of the tariffs, and ""adding further to the loss column, China retaliated by imposing antidumping duties on U.S. exports of chicken parts, costing that industry around $1 billion in sales.""

The Wall Street Journal noted that the steelworkers union ""believes the measure has been a success, adding jobs to the U.S. It cites anecdotal and other evidence of production expansion across the industry. Some companies have indeed added production and employees, but whether that is a result of the tariff or the recovery in the U.S. economy isn't entirely clear.""

Our ruling

Obama’s ad is accurate in stating that the president imposed trade sanctions against China in an effort to protect American workers and ""Mitt Romney attacked Obama's decision.""

But did the tariffs work? That’s less clear. Romney said the result was ""bad for our workers,"" and there are studies that back him up. Even with tire-making jobs that were saved, one analysis found that the higher price of tires depressed spending on other retail, and ultimately led to a loss in retail jobs.

The statement in the ad is accurate, but it needs additional information about the tire tariff’s effect. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809723C100>],/factchecks/2012/oct/01/barack-obama/ad-says-obama-defied-china-save-tire-making-jobs-h/

Union-backed ad says Mitt Romney's investments created zero jobs
","
For some voters, the mail recently brought a flier that said Mitt Romney’s investments created zero jobs.

For years we’ve checked empty claims from Republicans that President Barack Obama’s economic stimulus created ""zero jobs.""

Zero job creation makes for a catchy attack. But is it any more accurate about ""Romney’s investments"" than it was about Obama’s stimulus package?

Uh, no.

Romney made a personal fortune running private equity and venture capital firm Bain Capital, and super PACs are spending millions to show investments that ended with lost jobs and Bain profits.

That’s an incomplete snapshot of Bain’s portfolio — in fact, at least several of Bain's companies mushroomed, creating thousands of jobs.

Still, the ads and mailers keep coming, like this one the week of Sept. 17, 2012, from a super PAC associated with the union AFL-CIO.

The mailer, spotted by POLITICO, calls Romney’s business model at private equity firm Bain Capital ""un-American.""

It offered a chart titled ""Mitt Romney by the numbers,"" which included this:

""0: Number of jobs that Romney’s investments created.""

Zero?

A footnote says the source is a May 21, 2012, article published by Businessweek.com.

Eddie Vale, communications director for Workers’ Voice, pointed us to the final paragraphs of a BloombergBusinessweek story titled ""Mitt Romney's Private Equity Nightmare.""

The story paraphrases a former Romney colleague at Bain as saying, ""the main goal at buyout firms ... is never maximizing employment. ... It’s maximizing returns for investors.""

Vale said that was the point of the chart.

""The goal of Romney’s investments was to maximize profits, not create jobs. We are not saying he never created a job. He needs people to feed his dressage horse and wash his cars,"" Vale said. ""We are saying his investments were about maximizing profit. He did that by laying off workers and sending jobs overseas.""

But that doesn’t mean Romney’s investments created ""0"" jobs.

 Private equity vs. venture capital

In fact, sometimes Bain profits and jobs grew together.

Romney has repeatedly claimed that Bain was a job creator.

""In the business I had, we invested in over 100 different businesses and net-net, taking out the ones where we lost jobs and those that we added, those businesses have now added over 100,000 jobs.""

Independent journalists, including us, haven’t been able to confirm that ""net-net"" Bain investments added 100,000 jobs. Bain won’t release enough information to do the math.

But here are some things we do know. Sometimes Bain acted as a private equity firm, buying stakes in businesses, taking out loans to retool the companies and pay themselves fees, then selling their stakes at a profit. Thousands of workers lost their jobs.

But some studies show that private equity in general results in minimal net job loss. Companies shed jobs, but mostly make it up with hiring later.

Then there are the times that Bain acted as a venture capitalist, investing in young companies to help them grow. (Something that generally requires hiring workers, not laying them off.) That’s the case for companies like Staples, an example Romney loves to cite. And for good reason.

Here are the most widely reported Bain job gains and losses, as rounded up by FactCheck.org from POLITICO and the New York Times:

• Romney's campaign says three companies in which Bain invested alone have created more than 100,000 jobs: Staples (89,000), Sports Authority (15,000) and Domino's (7,900 jobs added since 1999). That's 111,900 jobs.

(Two of those were venture capital investments; Domino’s was a private equity buyout.)

• Companies that lost jobs include American Pad & Paper (385), Dade International (1,900), DDi Corp. (2,100), Clear Channel Communications (2,500) and KB Toys (3,400). That's 10,285 jobs.

Other roundups with a narrower time frame — the years before Romney retired — also show tens of thousands of new jobs, and fewer job losses.

None of these tallies is comprehensive. There’s also a fair question whether Romney deserves credit for all jobs gained — or blame for jobs lost. Some commentators say the issue isn’t that Bain companies shed jobs, but that they shed ""good jobs."" But this ad went way beyond that thoughtful criticism. It said his investments’ job creation was zero.

 Our ruling

Workers’ Voice says the ""number of jobs that Romney’s investments created"" is zero. That ignores Bain’s role as a venture capital firm that helped build companies that hired tens of thousands of workers.

The PAC, unable to provide data to back up its claim, said the goal of Romney’s investments wasn’t jobs, but profits. That doesn’t prove Bain’s job creation was zero. Nor do examples of Romney investments that lost jobs. This catchy claim comes up empty.

Chamber of Commerce says health care ""public option"" idea was ""wildly unpopular""
","
""Are you listening,"" Tammy?

That’s the question posed in new campaign ad portraying Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin as indifferent to constituent pleas about Medicare.

In the spot, funded by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, an actress posing as Baldwin eagerly deletes phone messages from regular folks calling her office line.

""Does it make you mad Tammy Baldwin voted to cut $716 billion from Medicare?"" a narrator asks.

Meanwhile, the phone messages play:

""My mom depends on Medicare, why would you vote to cut it?""

Delete.

""Keep your hands off my Medicare!""

Delete.

The spot concludes by urging a vote against Baldwin, and asks, incredulously: ""Can you believe Tammy even supported the wildly unpopular public option?""

We’re familiar with the ""cut Medicare"" claim, which Republicans and allies have leveled since the 2010 ""Obamacare"" health reform law passed with support from Democrats including Baldwin, a House member.

In one example, the Chamber of Commerce said ""seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund Obamacare."" That was rated Mostly False by PolitiFact Florida, which found that ""Medicare spending is still set to increase, just not at as high a rate as originally anticipated."" (The difference -- first estimated at $500 billion, now at $716 billion -- helps pay for other parts of the law).

Remember the so-called ""public option?""

That’s what we’re looking at here: Did Baldwin vote for something that was ""wildly unpopular""?

The idea -- ultimately left out of the bill -- was to create government-run health insurance to compete with private plans. The public option was an alternative to a ""single payer system"" or so called ""Medicare for all."" It was floated in part to appease more liberal Democrats who were critical of the bill’s reliance on private health insurers.

We rated Mostly True a claim by GOP Senate candidate Tommy Thompson that Baldwin ""wants a health care system that is completely government controlled"" and goes beyond ObamaCare. In that item, we noted Baldwin favored a public option or a single-payer system.

But the thrust of the claim was that the public option was ""wildly unpopular."" That is, Baldwin took a position most people at the time opposed.

We asked the U.S. Chamber, which wants to repeal the health care law, for backup for its claim. The group cited two public opinion surveys: An NBC News poll (August 2009) found a 47 percent plurality against the public option and a Rasmussen Reports voters’ poll (July 2009) showed only 35 percent support.

But what about other polls taken at the time?

We turned to the archives of the respected Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, which maintains a huge database mostly of media and commercial polls.

With help from Roper, we found 32 poll questions that asked directly about the public option from April 2009 to March 2010, when the law passed. They were from polls by or for Gallup, Bloomberg, the Kaiser Family Foundation, NBC/Wall Street Journal, CNN, the Independent Women’s Forum, CBS, the Democracy Corps, ABC/Washington Post and others.

In other words, mostly polls by or for the mainstream media and established polling organizations, with a sprinkling of surveys for groups with ideological leanings on the left and right.

Here’s what we found:

-- Of the 32 polls, support for the public option outweighed opposition in 28 of them.

-- Across those 28 polls, the average size of the group that favored the option was 57 percent. The opposition group averaged 38 percent in those polls.

-- There were four polls in which opposition was stronger than support; 53 percent was the average size of the negative group in those polls. One was the NBC poll pointed out to us by the Chamber of Commerce.
The Rasmussen poll did not turn up in our search. But it did show -- as the Chamber said -- only 35 percent of likely voters supported a public option. In the poll, 50 percent said they opposed it.

Now, we’re sure we didn’t look track down every poll or poll question taken on this topic. But the clear conclusion from a deep dive into the polls is that opinion leaned pretty strongly in favor of a public option.

Beyond that, there is no evidence for the Chamber’s claim of ""wildly unpopular"" -- the highest negative rating they sent us as back up was 50 percent.

The Chamber told us that, polling aside, the public option was ""deeply unpopular"" in the business community, its primary constituency. That may be true, but the claim made in the ad focused on the opinions of regular folks -- the ones dialing up Baldwin.

A final note: The Chamber of Commerce, as well as Republican critics of the polling, say that when pollsters drilled down, support for a public option waned as people heard details or were presented with possible ramifications.

We noticed that as well in some surveys. But a significant number of people’s support for Obama’s reform plan overall was conditioned on his including a public option.

Our rating

The Chamber terms the Baldwin-supported public option ""wildly unpopular.""

That’s way off target based on a broad look at surveys taken during the health care debate. The public option was far more popular than not, though some of that support was fickle.

Chris Christie claims Ronald Reagan won 40 states after trailing Jimmy Carter prior to 1980 debate
","Mitt Romney may have hit a rough patch on the campaign trail, but Gov. Chris Christie recently suggested a winning debate performance this week could propel the Republican presidential candidate to victory in November. Just like the 1980 debate took Ronald Reagan from trailing in the polls to winning 40 states on Election Day, the governor said. The New Jersey governor offered that history lesson last week as Romney and President Barack Obama gear up for their first debate Wednesday. Obama has been leading Romney in most national polls. ""Ask Ronald Reagan if he were around, you know, who was behind in the polls in 1980 going into the debate with Jimmy Carter and then turned around 10 days later and won 40 states,"" Christie, a Republican, said at a Sept. 24 news conference. ""These debates matter. They’re very important.""

It’s true that Reagan won 44 states in the 1980 election, but it’s not entirely accurate for Christie to say Reagan ""was behind in the polls"" going into the debate with Carter.

Leading up to that Oct. 28, 1980 debate -- a week before Election Day -- some polls showed Carter with a slight advantage over Reagan, but other polls had Reagan ahead of the president. Still, given the margins of error attached to the polls, the race appeared too close to call, according to various news articles.

The governor’s office did not respond to two e-mails seeking comment.

Let’s review some of those poll results.

In a Gallup poll released the day before the debate, Carter was leading Reagan by three percentage points, 45 percent to 42 percent. That poll was based on a sample of 1,100 registered voters, including 800 likely voters.

Another poll done for ABC News and released around the same time offered the exact opposite results: Reagan stood at 45 percent and Carter at 42 percent among likely voters.

But news articles said that because of the margins of error for those two polls, the ""race is essentially even"" and a ""virtual dead heat.""

An Associated Press-NBC News poll around the same time showed Reagan with a greater lead over Carter. Among likely voters, 42 percent supported Reagan and 36 percent backed Carter. That poll still had a margin of error of three percent.

""Generally, comparable results from all these polls fall within the error margins of such surveys, meaning the race is really too close to call,"" the Associated Press wrote.

The week before the debate, a CBS News/New York Times poll showed Carter leading Reagan, 43 percent to 41 percent among undecided voters. But given that poll’s sampling error, ""Mr. Carter’s lead thus was highly uncertain, and it is quite possible that Mr. Reagan may actually be somewhat ahead,"" according to a New York Times article.

Still, Reagan’s debate performance has been considered a deciding factor in his ultimate victory.

""It is my contention that there was significant change in presidential preference by the public starting with the Carter/Reagan debate that accelerated through election day,"" Warren J. Mitofsky, a pollster for CBS News, later wrote.

However, leading up to Election Day, polls failed to capture the scope of Reagan's landslide win. As Mitofsky noted, all of the major published polls ""seriously understated"" Reagan’s margin of victory over Carter.

In terms of the popular vote, Reagan received about 51.6 percent, beating Carter’s roughly 41.7 percent. The 1980 presidential race also included Independent candidate John B. Anderson, who received about 6.7 percent of the popular vote.

Our ruling

At a news conference, Christie claimed Ronald Reagan ""was behind in the polls in 1980 going into the debate with Jimmy Carter and then turned around 10 days later and won 40 states.""

Reagan went on to win 44 states, but it was not necessarily the comeback victory described by Christie. Reagan was behind in some polls and ahead of Carter in others. Given the margins of error for the polls, the race was ""too close to call"" and a ""virtual dead heat,"" articles show.

Is there a gender wage gap in every state?
","
Women: You’ve come a long way, but still have a ways to go, according to the National Women’s Law Center.

The NWLC revisited the gender wage gap debate last month, citing recently released federal statistics showing the difference between the earnings of men and women in the United States. Using the data, the organization devised a state-by-state ranking of women’s median earnings compared with men’s.

""In every state, women are paid less than men,"" the NWLC said in a Sept. 21 news release about its analysis. The liberal-leaning advocacy organization for women’s issues also cited the national gender wage gap showing that women are paid 77 cents for every dollar paid to men.

The organization’s leaders are using the analysis to push Congress to enact the Paycheck Fairness Act to address the disparity. That legislation -- sponsored by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., and supported by the Obama administration -- is intended to strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963: proposed guidelines to show employers how to evaluate jobs with a goal of eliminating inequities. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives in January 2009 but failed twice in the Senate, in November 2010 and in June 2012.

The gender wage gap issue has been studied for years and has been targeted through legislation including the Equal Pay Act and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. Still, the NWLC statement about all 50 states seemed broad. Was there the possibility that in at least one state the wage gap either didn’t exist or favored women? And what factors were considered to determine the gap?

The two most common sources for this type of gender wage data are the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. NWLC used data from the Census Bureau’s 2011 American Community Survey, released last month, to calculate wage gaps in each of the 50 states and Washington, D.C.

Using the Community Survey’s statistics, the NWLC calculated the wage gap for each state as the ratio of female and male median earnings for full-time, year-round workers. (The Community Survey classified full-time, year-round workers as those being 16 years old and over and who usually worked 35 hours or more per week.) The wage gaps are presented as the number of cents women are paid for every dollar paid to their male counterparts. Using this methodology, the organization’s statement is accurate.

For example, Georgia ranked 13th out of the 50 states and Washington, D.C., in order of the highest wage gaps by jurisdiction. In Georgia, the wage gap was 80.7 percent, meaning that for every dollar a man earned, women earned just under 81 cents. Georgia males earned $43,902 and women earned $35,438 annually, a difference of $8,464.

In that ranking, Washington, D.C., fared the best, with women making about 90 cents for every dollar men make. In Wyoming, where the wage gap was the largest, women earned 66.6 cents for each dollar earned by men.

The NWLC analysis also includes the often-used statistic that the national gender wage gap is 77 percent, or more clearly: For every dollar a man earns, a woman earns 77 cents. The national wage gap calculated by the organization is based on census data that  tracks full-time, year-round worker wages regardless of occupation.

PolitiFact has examined wage disparity claims with varying outcomes. Supporters of wage gap legislation typically cite the 77-cent figure without clarifying that the gap does not take into account other factors that could influence the figure, including occupation, employment longevity and education. The census data shows the widest gap, but other data, including hourly wages tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for example, yields smaller differences. Using BLS data, women are paid 86 percent of the median hourly wages of men.

So, does the NWLC’s claim hold up? Based on Census Bureau data, it does appear that women are paid less than men in every state and Washington, D.C. In considering other data and influences, the wage disparity amount, specifically the national wage gap, is smaller, but still exists.  

We rate it True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AFE940>],/factchecks/2012/oct/01/national-womens-law-center/there-gender-wage-gap-every-state/

Tim Kaine says George Allen voted to end Pell Grants for 84,000 students
","
Democratic Senate candidate Tim Kaine says that George Allen, his Republican opponent, is no friend of students struggling to pay for college.

""Allen voted to end Pell Grants for 84,000 students,"" Kaine said in a September 12 news release.

The Pell Grant program is primarily aimed at helping low-income undergraduates by providing federal grants, based on need. The maximum award to a student is now $5,500 a school year.

Allen served in the U.S. Senate from 2001 to 2007. Kaine backs up his charge by citing a vote Allen cast on Sept. 10, 2003, on an amendment to an appropriations bill funding the Department of Education and other agencies.

The amendment proposed to stop a plan by the Department of Education to tighten the formula for determining Pell Grant eligibility during the 2004-05 school year by changing how much families could deduct on financial disclosure forms for the state and local taxes they paid. It would have been the first time in 10 years that the formula had been changed.

Demand for Pell Grants had been steadily rising as more low-income students were going to college. The new formula was designed to ease pressure on the program by ending the eligibility of students who came from the most well-off of the low-income families.

Sen. John Corzine, D-NJ, successfully sponsored an amendment to delay implementation of the new formula for a year. The amendment passed the Senate, 51-44, with Allen voting against it.

Kaine’s campaign cited a story that ran in The Chronicle of Higher Education shortly after the vote. It said the Department of Education estimated that 84,000 students -- 1.6 percent of Pell Grant recipients --  would lose eligibility for the program in the 2004-05 school year if the new formula went into effect.

The 84,000 figure was widely reported in 2003 and a number of newspapers, including The New York Times, attributed it to a study by the Congressional Research Service that June.

We could not find a copy of the CRS report. But we did track down a January 2005 study by the U.S. Government Accounting Office that said the changed formula  ""would have likely resulted in a decrease in Pell Grant awards for about 36 percent of students, and an additional 92,000 applicants (2 percent) would no longer have been eligible for the grant.""

The Education Department said most of those losing eligibility would be students from higher income families who would no longer receive the minimum grant of $400 back then.

Allen’s campaign, in a web post, said Kaine’s claim ""doesn’t add up,"" because Allen voted for the for the overall education appropriation bill for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, 2003 and it increased total spending for Pell Grants as well the number of recipients.

Department of Education figures show the appropriation for Pell Grants rose from $11.36 billion in the 2002-2003 fiscal year to $12 billion in 2003-2004 -- a $640 million increase. That would have outweighed the $290 million in savings from the changed formula estimated by the GAO.

The number of Pell Grant recipients increased from 5.1 million in the 2003-2004 school year to 5.3 million in 2004-2005.

Congress did not stand in the way of the formula change a second time and it was incorporated in the education budget for the 2005-2006 school year.  The number of Pell Grant recipients fell to 5.17 million that year. The total appropriation for the grants rose to $12.36 billion due to the complicated nature of the program.

Our ruling

Kaine said Allen voted to end Pell Grants for 84,000 students. The need-based federal grant typically goes to undergraduate students from low-income families.  

There’s no doubt that Allen in 2003 cast a specific vote to alter the financial aid formula for awarding Pell Grants and that the non-partisan GAO said the change would drop 92,000 students from eligibility. He was on the losing side of that vote.

Allen argues that even if the more restrictive formula had been enacted back then, the overall education budget -- which he supported -- would have still increased total funding for Pell Grants and the number of recipients would have risen the next school year. He’s right on that point.

So Kaine’s statement is accurate but lacks some information: Allen’s vote would not have cut the overall Pell Grant program; it would have slowed its rate of growth. For that we reason, we rate Kaine’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AFD140>],/factchecks/2012/oct/01/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-george-allen-voted-end-pell-grants-/
"['Ohio', 'Elections', 'Military', 'Mike DeWine']","
Special voting access for the military nothing new, dates from the Civil War, Mike DeWine says
","
Mike DeWine was ready to fight. 

In the wake of a federal court decision that restored absentee voting the weekend before Election Day for military and civilian voters, DeWine was ready to duke it out in court some more. 

At an Aug. 31 news conference, DeWine expressed his displeasure with the decision by a federal judge which ruled that all Ohio voters would get a chance to vote in-person absentee the weekend before Election Day. 

As attorney for the state, DeWine's office had argued that only military voters should be eligible to vote in-person absentee but the judge ruled otherwise stating that to allow only one group of voters access to the polls amounted to unequal protection under the law.

The judge's decision in Obama v. Husted was an affirmation of the position of President Barack Obama's campaign which had argued that you couldn't treat military voters any different than other voters. 

But DeWine disagreed, and as he spoke at his news conference about the state's appeal he cited what he said was a long history of absentee voting for military members. 

""Since the time of the Civil War, we've made a distinction in this country between the availability and the ability to access for people who were in the military, versus the rest of us, to vote,"" DeWine said.  ""And we've made that distinction because of the unique situation the people in the military are in. We've done this now for about 150 years, and so this is not anything new."" 

Really? 

Has the United State allowed absentee voting by military members dating back to the Civil War?

We decided to rustle up our musket, our finest blue and gray duds and check it out for ourselves.   

We first turned to DeWine's office who responded quickly with a few references from legal briefs filed with the court. Several footnotes to the legal briefs mentioned the same source--a University of Michigan Law Review Journal article by John C. Fortier and Norman Ornstein.  

The article, entitled The Absentee Ballot and the Secret Ballot: Challenges for Election Reform, traces the history of absentee voting in the United States. And lo and behold, the authors find the Civil War was largely the starting point for absentee voting laws. 

""The early impetus behind absentee balloting was war; making sure that soldiers on the battlefield were not disenfranchised by their military service,"" it states. ""The Civil War inspired the first major effort for absentee balloting in the United States.""  

Fortier and Ornstein tally up 19 of 25 Union states and 7 of 11 states in the southern confederacy as having had absentee voting laws for soldiers during the Civil War. Prior to the Civil War, it appears that only Pennsylvania had military absentee voting thanks to a law passed in 1813, which allowed soldiers stationed more than two miles away from home to vote absentee, the authors state. 

Furthermore, one of the citations provided by DeWine's office points to a U.S. Court of Appeals decision which references the Civil War as the starting point. 

""Absentee voting began during the Civil War as a means of providing soldiers the right to vote,"" reads a snippet of the U.S. Ninth District Court of Appeals 2001 decision in Voting Integrity Project v. Kielsing. 

So it seems clear the Civil War was the starting point for all but Pennsylvania. But that doesn't mean those laws stayed on the books as DeWine implies. 

Turning again to Fortier and Ornstein, the authors state ""these laws applied only to military voting, and most were discontinued after the end of the (Civil) War."" 

A scholarly article co-authored by Daniel Tokaji, an OSU professor, arrives at much the same conclusion. 

""Yet, according to a 1915 survey, absentee ballots disappeared after the Civil War, to the point that only six states retained military absentee voting statutes,"" it reads. 

This had changed drastically by 1924, when all but three states had absentee voting laws on the books for military and civilians, the article states.  

Reached at his Columbus office, Tokaji said absentee voting for the military largely began in the Civil War but did not continue unnterrupted for the last 150 years. ""There has been some waxing and waning over the years,"" he said. ""It's not a story of steady progress over the years as time has marched on."" 

So where does that leave us? 

At a news conference following a federal court decision that cited equal protection law and ordered absentee voting for all voters the weekend before Election Day, Mike DeWine said the decision was wrong. In part, DeWine said that was because military voters and civilian voters have been treated differently dating back to the Civil War. He also implied that it has been that way uninterrupted since the Civil War. 

The historical record seems to be undisputed that absentee voting for the military went from being allowed only in Pennsylvania prior to the Civil War to being allowed in most Union states and a majority of the confederacy during the Civil War.  

However, those laws were repealed in most states following the Civil War. By 1915 only six states still had military absentee voting. That changed in the decade that followed and those laws appear to have stayed on the books ever since allowing absentee voting access for military voters. 

DeWine was partially correct. Special absentee voting privileges have been extended to military voters dating back to the Civil War. 

However, he also implied that those laws have been on the books for the past 150 years. This is true only in a handful of states, the vast majority of states had to reenact military voting statutes after 1915.  

That’s important information his claim leaves out that put the statement in full context.

7,000 millionaires ""gamed the system"" to pay zero federal income taxes, U.S. Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin says
","
U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., sounds a populist theme when she says she wants all Americans to pay their fair share f taxes.

It’s part of an effort to brand herself as a fighter for the middle class and to contrast herself with her U.S. Senate opponent, former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson, whom she casts as a wealthy Washington insider.

In that vein, Baldwin sent a fund-raising email to supporters Sept. 22, 2012 repeating a claim that Thompson wants to raise taxes on the middle class in order to give tax breaks to millionaires like himself. We previously rated that claim Half True- the millionaires part of Baldwin’s claim was correct, but the middle class part far less clear.

In the same email, Baldwin got more specific.

She claimed she ""is fighting for a country where opportunity exists for everyone -- not just the 7,000 millionaires who gamed the system to pay no income taxes on their fortunes.""

Did 7,000 millionaires pay no income taxes because they ""gamed the system""?

7,000 millionaires, no taxes

Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus cited as evidence a table published in July 2011 by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution in Washington.

The center estimated that 7,000 households that earned ""cash income"" of more than $1 million in 2011 paid no federal income tax. That’s an estimate based on taxpayer data, not a hard number.

Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the center, told us the center now believes the figure is 4,000 millionaires, but said he doesn't fault Baldwin for using the larger number given that the table has not been revised. The 7,000 figure has been widely cited on the Internet.

As for the ""cash income"" measure, it includes compensation that isn’t taxable, such as employer-provided health insurance. Williams said the Tax Policy Center viewed that as a more accurate way of defining millionaires, but he acknowledged it is a broader measure than what the Internal Revenue Service uses.

Indeed, that’s what The Washington Post Fact Checker found in examining the 7,000 figure in April 2012, nine months after publication of the table Baldwin relies on.

If adjusted gross income -- the figure at the bottom of your 1040 tax form -- is used, 1,470 millionaires paid no federal income taxes in 2009, according to the most recent IRS figure available. According to the Tax Foundation, another Washington, D.C., research group, the figure dropped to 1,403 in 2010.

As for millionaires as a class, according to the Tax Foundation, millionaires paid an effective tax rate of 25 percent and paid 22 percent of all federal income taxes collected in 2010.

So, Baldwin relied on a respected group for the 7,000 figure, but the number is actually smaller, and that had been established months before she made her claim.

Gaming the system

The second part of Baldwin's claim -- that millionaires who paid no federal income taxes had somehow ""gamed the system"" -- suggests they did something improper.

Kraus, Baldwin’s spokesman, provided as evidence a May 2012 news article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel about Beloit billionaire Diane Hendricks, who serves as treasurer of Thompson's campaign. The article said Hendricks paid no state income tax in 2010, which was attributed to a change in the corporate structure of a company she owned.

But Baldwin's claim was about federal taxes. So at best, Kraus is off point.

Williams, of the Tax Policy Center, said the roughly 1 percent of millionaires who pay no federal income taxes are able to do so because some sources of their income aren’t taxed and because of deductions provided in the tax code.

Aside from employer-provided health insurance, other types of income that aren’t taxed include tax-exempt municipal bonds. In addition, some high earners, such as certain hedge fund managers, can avoid higher tax rates by receiving more of their pay as capital gains rather than earned income.

Items that can reduce a millionaire’s taxes to zero include credits for taxes paid on income received in foreign nations, and deductions for charitable contributions made, as well as for state and local taxes paid.

Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation, agreed that foreign tax credits and deductions for charitable contributions are key reasons why some high earners pay no federal income tax. Another big reason is many of those households own businesses that suffered losses, he said. Hodge said none of those factors constitutes having ""gamed the system.""  

Indeed, when it was disclosed in September 2012 that GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said 47 percent of Americans pay no federal income taxes, PolitiFact National rated his statement True. Utilizing Tax Policy Center research, our colleagues found that about half of people who don’t pay income taxes are simply poor, and the tax code explicitly exempts them, while the rest benefit from tax breaks.

Williams said that if people feel there is something wrong with a system that allows some people to pay no income taxes, they should work to ""fix the system, don’t complain about people doing perfectly legal things.""

Our rating

Baldwin said 7,000 millionaires ""gamed the system to pay no income taxes.""

But her figure is high and she provides no evidence that millionaires ""gamed the system."" What’s clear is they worked within the system, however flawed it may or may not be.

Joe Kyrillos campaign claims Bob Menendez voted in favor of higher taxes more than 70 times
","
When is a vote not a vote? It depends on who’s doing the counting, apparently.

And with about five weeks to Election Day on Nov. 6, the issue of tax hikes is one of the latest volleys in the heated Bob Menendez-Joe Kyrillos campaign for U.S. Senate.

The Kyrillos campaign, for example, claims Menendez, a Democrat, has never met a tax increase he didn’t like – and support.

""Bob Menendez actually voted in favor of higher taxes more than 70 times!"" states an Aug. 29 news release posted on a campaign website for Kyrillos, a Republican from Monmouth County.

""These are direct votes against tax cuts as well as votes to raise taxes, votes in favor of reducing proposed tax cuts, votes for non-binding resolutions supporting taxes, among others,"" Kyrillos spokeswoman Meaghan Cronin said in an e-mail that included a list of 72 Menendez votes.

The Kyrillos campaign’s claim has a degree of accuracy, but there’s some important context missing.

Our analysis of the 72 shows that in many cases, Menendez’s votes support or give tax breaks to the middle class by reducing or eliminating tax breaks for the wealthy and big business. Many of Menendez’s votes were for education, needy children, agriculture, the environment and the disabled. Still others were for national security and safety.

But there are some issues with those votes. More than half of the 72 do not actually change tax policy or law. Others have to do with procedural rules for voting, which also cannot change law.

Let’s look at two examples.

Menendez in 2006 voted to increase a congressional spending limit by $965 million to put more money toward port security. That money would be offset by ending certain corporate tax breaks.

In 2011, Menendez voted to end debate on a bill asking those earning $1 million or more to make ""meaningful contributions"" to help reduce the deficit. That procedure then allows an immediate vote.

For some, the senator’s intent is key.

""This is not to take a partisan side either way but I would think most people reading about a record like this would ask the simple question, what the intent of the person was casting the vote, besides what the actual outcome was,"" said Pete Sepp, a spokesman with the National Taxpayers Union in Alexandria, Va. The NTU advocates for lower taxes and smaller government.

Seth Hanlon, director of fiscal reform for the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress Action Fund, had context concerns.

""This controversy that they’re having here is, if you get past the semantics, it’s basically about whose tax cuts we’re talking about: Tax cuts for the middle class he supports very consistently or supporting tax breaks for very wealthy people, millionaires, oil companies, corporate tax breaks,"" Hanlon said. ""We need to look through the semantics and look at the record on middle class tax cuts.""

Paul Brubaker, Menendez’s communications director, said the vote list shows Menendez’s support for siding with the middle class over millionaires and corporate special interests.

And there’s another issue to consider: is voting against a tax benefit for one group in order to fund a tax break for another group the same as a tax increase? That’s the case for many of the resolutions that can’t change tax law.

PolitiFact National addressed that question in an August fact-check about a U.S. Senate race in Florida in which the Republican incumbent accused his Democratic challenger of voting 150 times to raise taxes.

Our colleagues spoke with a few federal budget experts who generally agreed that a vote against a tax cut doesn’t equal a tax increase.

Chapin Fay, Kyrillos’ campaign manager, disagreed.

""All of the votes we cite are votes in favor of higher taxes,"" he said in an e-mail.

Our ruling

The Kyrillos campaign claims in a news release that ""Bob Menendez actually voted in favor of higher taxes more than 70 times!""

More than half of the votes cited by the Kyrillos campaign have no effect on tax law or are procedural matters. There also are Menendez votes that give or extend tax breaks to the middle class at the expense of the wealthy and corporations – but federal budget experts have said that a tax break for one group isn’t the same as a tax increase for another.

Menendez did vote in favor of bills that would mean higher taxes, so there’s an element of truth to the claim. But since so many of the bills would have no effect on tax law or policy, that’s a critical fact that would give a different impression – and that meets the definition for Mostly False.

U.S. Rep. David Cicilline says Republican opponent Brendan Doherty wants to repeal Obamacare and increase drug prices for seniors
","
If you vow to repeal a law but then promise to preserve some of its key provisions, are you really promising to repeal the law?

That's the question surrounding an advertisement in support of Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline's attempt to hold his 1st District seat against a challenge by Republican Brendan Doherty.

The 30-second television ad, produced by Cicilline’s campaign, shows video of Doherty praising GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and lists some ways in which the two agree on key issues. It is available on YouTube.

One issue is the Affordable Health Care Act, the controversial legislation often referred to as Obamacare.

""Doherty and Romney both want to repeal Obamacare, increasing drug prices for seniors,"" the ad says.

Romney has already made it clear he wants to repeal the law. In looking at the assertion, we will focus on Doherty’s position.

Doherty has said repeatedly that he wants to repeal Obamacare because it places too much of a burden on small businesses.

One element of the law was crafted to save Medicare recipients a lot of money because it closes the so-called ""doughnut hole,"" the gap in prescription drug coverage that has forced elderly people with health problems to shell out thousands of dollars per year.

If Obamacare were simply repealed, the hole would reopen and its effect would be as Cicilline describes it.

But if Doherty were elected and a new federal law were passed that closed the doughnut hole, Doherty could then vote to repeal Obamacare without increasing drug prices for seniors.

Doherty has repeatedly said he wants to keep the doughnut hole closed. He also has said that he wouldn’t repeal Obamacare without preserving that popular feature, and others.

In a July 2, 2012, appearance on ""The Helen Glover Show,"" Doherty said ""I would vote to repeal it. But I think we need to find better solutions even before we repeal it.""

A bit later, he specifically referred to continuing coverage for young adults and people with pre-existing conditions and protecting people in the doughnut hole as ""good points"" in the law. He said those are areas ""to have real health care reform.""

Separately, the Doherty campaign sent us a July 12, 2012, news release in which the candidate criticized House Republicans for voting to repeal Obamacare ""without offering any alternative proposal.""

And we put the question to him directly, asking Doherty if he would, if elected, cast any vote to repeal Obamacare if the government hadn't first passed a law closing the doughnut hole. He said, ""No.""

But he said the safeguards could be part of a repeal bill.

""I wouldn't vote for any repeal of Obamacare if we didn't have the doughnut hole closed,"" or protection for children up to 26 years old and coverage ""for preexisting conditions in that,"" he said.

Cicilline spokesman Eric Hyers, asked about the ad and Doherty's support for some elements of Obamacare, said in an e-mail: ""Simply because [Doherty] says he wants to find a bipartisan solution or that he has started mentioning parts of the bill he likes, is irrelevant. As soon as the bill is repealed, the benefits are gone and closing the doughnut hole, (or allowing young people to stay on their parents' insurance or whatever else), would have to be re-fought. Saying, 'He thinks there should be a solution before repeal,' is nice, but it doesn't change the real world implications of voting for repeal.""

Our ruling

David Cicilline, in a campaign ad, says Brendan Doherty wants ""to repeal Obamacare, increasing drug prices for seniors.""

Doherty does want to repeal Obamacare, and a repeal would do precisely that.

But Doherty, at least as far back as July 2, has repeatedly said he would not vote for repeal until ""better solutions"" are found.

Such subtlety is lost in the Cicilline ad. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

In 2019, few Florida felons got their voting rights back through clemency board
","Florida voters passed Amendment 4 in 2018 with the intention of restoring voting rights to most felons who served their time. But how it will work remains uncertain due to litigation, and a waiting list for felons who want to restore their rights the traditional route continues to swell. State Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried said officials don’t have to wait on the legal battle to make the process easier for felons. The four-person state Cabinet could make the changes through the clemency board, she said, referring to the body that already has the power to grant restoration of civil rights.  Fried, the only Democrat on the Cabinet, asked her Republican colleagues on the board to adopt new rules for clemency. But that hasn’t happened, she said, and the result has been far fewer rights restored under Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration than under previous governors Charlie Crist, Jeb Bush and Rick Scott. ""Under Governor Crist, over 155,000 Floridians had their rights restored,"" Fried said. ""Under Governor Bush, over 76,000. Even under Governor Scott, more than 3,000 of our fellow citizens earned back their right to participate in society."" Fried then pivoted to lower numbers under the current Cabinet. ""But so far this year, under this clemency board, four have gotten their rights back,"" Fried told reporters at a pre-session gathering in Tallahassee. ""That is not a typo. Four. Four people."" We hadn’t heard that number, so we decided to look into it. Verifying the number since she made the remarks on Oct. 29 required a public record request and weeks of dialogue with state officials. We found that Fried has a point that very few people have gotten their rights restored by the new clemency board in its first year. But there are ways to count restorations that add up to a little more than four.   Fried joins three Republicans on the clemency board: Gov. DeSantis, Attorney General Ashley Moody and Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis. The board reviews cases for eligible applicants at a public meeting about four times a year. The backlog of cases approached 11,000 as of Oct. 1. Amendment 4 was intended to largely get rid of this process for many felons seeking to only regain their right to vote. Amendment 4 restored the voting rights of Floridians with felony convictions after they complete their sentences. It does not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offenses. The four Floridians Fried referenced were granted restoration of civil rights through the clemency board on Sept. 25, according to a video of the meeting. Each of the four  had their civil rights restored, but none were granted pardons. That means they were not forgiven by the state. That opens up another possibility, state officials told us: Other felons could have had their rights restored through pardons. Florida’s clemency rules state that a full pardon ""restores to an applicant all of the rights of citizenship possessed by the person before his or her conviction."" In other words, a full pardon also restores civil rights including the right to vote. We submitted a public record request with the Florida Commission on Offender Review seeking records to show how many got pardons and their rights restored at the same time. The agency handles decisions related to clemency and parole. A review of the records showed 20 people have gotten their rights restored through the board so far this year. That includes the four who were granted clemency but did not get a pardon. Because Amendment 4 was supposed to become the main vehicle for felons to regain their voting rights (rather than the clemency board), the clemency board doesn’t appear to have taken up many cases since its passage.  Meredith Beatrice, a spokeswoman for DeSantis, said that Amendment 4’s automatic restoration of voting rights has significant implications for the clemency process. The clemency board has prioritized requests for other forms of clemency during its meetings this year. DeSantis also said that Amendment 4 didn’t address other rights such as the right to serve on a jury or hold public office. He said he is considering restoring those rights for non-violent offenders. Litigation has created confusion about which felons can register.  ""It’s anyone’s best guess how many individuals have registered who have a former felony conviction,"" University of Florida political scientist Daniel A. Smith said. ""The state is not tracking it, nor do I think there is any way for them to track it."" Fried said that while previous clemency boards granted restoration of civil rights to thousands of Floridians, ""so far this year, under this clemency board, four (felons) have gotten their rights back."" Fried was counting one group of people who got their rights restored without a pardon. And we confirmed four people had their rights restored by the clemency board in 2019. They sought pardons and did not get them. But we found an additional 16 people who did receive pardons and simultaneously had their rights restored. Fried’s overall point is correct: Very few people in Florida have had their rights restored by the clemency board this year, significantly lower than the thousands or tens of thousands under previous governors.  We rate this statement Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C1F280>],/factchecks/2019/nov/21/nikki-fried/2019-few-florida-felons-got-their-voting-rights-ba/

Elizabeth Warren misstates findings of racial disparities in student loans
","In the Nov. 20 Democratic presidential debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for student loan debt forgiveness after citing a startling racial disparity statistic. ""Today in America — a new study came out — 20 years out, whites who borrowed money, 94% of them have paid off their student loan debt; 5% of African Americans have paid it off,"" Warren, D-Mass., said. There are racial disparities when it comes to student debt.  But Warren misstated these two figures. Warren has proposed that, for anyone making under $100,000, the federal government would pay off up to $50,000 of their debt. The government would also help people making up to $250,000, although on a sliding scale. Student loan debt totals nearly $1.5 trillion, according to an August 2019 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That’s as high as it’s ever been and up about 200% from 2006, we’ve found. It is a result of increases in both the number of borrowers and the loan balances they carry. As for race, 17.7% of borrowers who live in black-majority ZIP codes default on their student loans — nearly double the rate (9%) of borrowers from white-majority areas, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released a week before the debate. But Warren’s claim alludes to a September 2019 report from Brandeis University in Massachusetts. The major finding of the Brandeis study is this:  ""Twenty years after starting college, the median debt of white borrowing students has been reduced by 94% — with almost half holding no student debt — whereas black borrowers at the median still owe 95% of their cumulative borrowing total.""   The problem here is that Warren talked about borrowers, whereas the statistic she tried to cite from the study talked about the amounts borrowed. 1. Warren claimed that the study said that 20 years out, 94% of white borrowers had paid off their student loans.  But what the study’s measure of student debt actually found is that, 20 years after starting college, the median debt of white borrowers had been reduced by 94%. 2. Warren claimed the study said that only 5% of African American borrowers had paid off their student debt. But the study found that the median debt of black borrowers had decreased by only 5%. We wondered about data for the borrowers.  Three student debt experts who were not part of the study pointed out another racial disparity finding of the study: 48% of white borrowers had paid off their student loans, compared with 26% of black borrowers. A Warren campaign spokesman acknowledged that Warren misquoted the study, saying the study is ""another alarming reminder of why we need to cancel student loan debt and close the racial wealth gap."" One of the study’s authors told us that Warren gets right the broader policy point that there are racial disparities in student debt that should be addressed. ""In the important discourse concerning student debt and when race is added, Sen. Warren is right on the mark,"" said Tom Shapiro, director of Brandeis’ Institute on Assets and Social Policy. But, as we’ve laid out, the way she stated it in the debate was wrong. Warren said: ""Today in America — a new study came out — 20 years out, whites who borrowed money, 94% of them have paid off their student loan debt; 5% of African Americans have paid it off."" There are racial disparities in repaying student loans, but Warren misquoted a Brandeis University study. It found that 20 years after starting college, the amount of debt of white borrowers had been reduced by 94%, versus 5% for black borrowers. We rate Warren’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809700E100>],/factchecks/2019/nov/21/elizabeth-warren/elizabeth-warren-misstates-findings-racial-dispari/

Pete Buttigieg falsely says Donald Trump illegally diverted funds for veterans
","The Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta kicked off with a discussion of the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. Pete Buttigieg claimed that Trump’s conduct was impeachable, but also that Trump has already done something that would have gotten any other president out of the White House — and it has nothing to do with Ukraine. ""Under normal circumstances a president would leave office after something that was revealed recently that barely got any attention at all,"" Buttigieg said, ""which was the president had to confess in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans."" Is Buttigieg right that Trump admitted in writing to illegally diverting donations for veterans? No. Buttigieg mischaracterized what Trump agreed to in a lawsuit settlement. What Trump agreed to in writing was that his 2016 political campaign, instead of his charitable foundation, coordinated a fundraising event for veterans and directed the distribution of funds. A judge said that Trump breached his fiduciary duties to the foundation by allowing the campaign to take over the fundraiser, furthering his political campaign. The funds were given to veterans. Buttigieg’s campaign sent PolitiFact links to several articles about the settlement which pointed out that Trump’s campaign took control over the fundraiser and other admissions of wrongdoing. The New York Attorney General Office in June 2018 sued the Donald J. Trump Foundation, Trump (who founded the foundation and served as its president), and his three eldest children (who served on the board of directors). The lawsuit charged that the foundation persistently violated state and federal laws and that Trump repeatedly used his foundation's money for his own personal, business, and political interests. The foundation in December 2018 agreed to dissolve. Earlier this month, on Nov. 7, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced she’d reached a settlement in the lawsuit and that the New York Supreme Court ordered Trump to pay $2 million in damages ""for improperly using charitable assets to intervene in the 2016 presidential primaries and further his own political interests."" The settlement outlined several matters Trump agreed to. But the part that is most pertinent to this claim relates to early 2016, when Trump said that in lieu of attending a Republican primary debate he would hold a fundraiser for veterans in Iowa. Trump in the settlement agreed that his political campaign planned, organized, and paid for the fundraiser, with the administrative assistance of the foundation. Further, he agreed that the campaign ""directed the timing, amounts, and recipients of the foundation’s grants to charitable organizations supporting military veterans."" The event raised about $5.6 million in donations intended for veterans’ groups — about $2.8 million of that went to Trump’s foundation and the rest was donated directly to veterans’ groups. Trump even presented foundation checks to veterans’ groups during his campaign events. However, we find nothing in the settlement terms that suggests Trump admitted to illegally diverting those funds away from veterans, as Buttigieg claimed. Trump ""breached his fiduciary duty"" to the foundation by allowing his campaign to ""orchestrate"" the Iowa fundraiser and by ""using the fundraiser and distribution of the funds to further"" his political campaign, New York Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla said Nov. 7. ""I find that the $2,823,000 raised at the fundraiser was used for Mr. Trump’s political campaign and disbursed by Mr. Trump’s campaign staff, rather than by the foundation"" in violation of state laws, Scarpulla wrote. However, she added, ""the funds did ultimately reach their intended destinations, i.e., charitable organizations supporting veterans."" Buttigieg said, ""the president had to confess in writing, in court to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans."" Trump did not confess to illegally diverting money away from veterans. He admitted that his campaign took charge of a fundraiser for veterans, even though it featured the name of his foundation. A judge said Trump breached his fiduciary duties to the foundation and that the fundraiser and distribution of the funds helped Trump’s political campaign. But the funds did go to veterans.

It claims President Donald Trump fired Vindman, who is responsible for Ukraine policy on the National Security Council, for participating in the impeachment inquiry. ""Trumputin fired Lt. Col. Vindman because he testified agaisnt (sic) him and corroborated the Whistleblowers (sic) testimony that Trump indeed did attempt to extort Ukraine,"" the photo’s caption reads. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

(Screenshot from Facebook) Dworkin wrote that the president had fired Vindman from the NSC after he gave closed-door testimony about Trump’s July phone call with the president of Ukraine. The call, which Vindman listened to, is at the center of the impeachment investigation about whether Trump solicited Ukraine’s help to investigate political rival Joe Biden. Dworkin’s tweet was based on a story from Talking Points Memo about comments that National Security Agency Adviser Robert O’Brien made during a Nov. 10 interview with Margaret Brennan on CBS News’ ""Face the Nation.""  Here’s what they said on the show: Margaret Brennan: ""Lt. Col. Vindman, who has testified under oath, is serving on the National Security Council currently. Will he continue to work for you despite testifying against the president?""

So everyone who's detailed at the NSC, people are going to start going back to their own departments and we'll bring in new folks.""

Amy Klobuchar leans in on support for Roe vs. Wade, Planned Parenthood in Atlanta debate
","Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar trotted out statistics at the November Democratic presidential candidates’ debate — suggesting sweeping majorities oppose some of the abortion and reproductive health care policies backed by the Trump administration. ""Over 70% of the people support Roe vs. Wade. Over 90% of the people support funding for Planned Parenthood, and making sure women can get the health care they need,"" Klobuchar said. Those are large numbers for one of the nation’s most polarizing issues. So we decided to take a look and found that Klobuchar was correct in expressing public opinion on Roe vs.Wade, but overstated support for Planned Parenthood funding.  Roe v. Wade On 70% supporting Roe vs. Wade, Klobuchar’s statistic holds up. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll from this past June found that 77% of Americans wanted Roe vs. Wade upheld — though within that group, some support expanding circumstances in which abortion is legal, and others would like more restrictions. (The landmark court ruling is the basis for a women’s right to an abortion.) Another poll, conducted in 2018, found a similar figure: 71% of respondents told NBC/Wall Street Journal pollsters that they opposed overturning the legal standard.  Funding Planned Parenthood We couldn’t find any specific polling evidence for Klobuchar’s 90% statistic of support for Planned Parenthood. In fact, we found evidence indicating the support here is lower.  A majority of Americans do want the government to fund the network of clinics, which provides abortions but also many other health care services to mainly low-income women. This takes two forms: Planned Parenthood can bill government health plans for non-abortion services — since federal law blocks taxpayer dollars from paying directly for abortions — and means Planned Parenthood clinics are eligible for funding from the federal Title X program, which supports low-income women’s access to contraception. Right now, Planned Parenthood is not accepting any Title X funding because the Trump administration has banned the program’s grantees from referring patients for abortions.  Polling from this past April by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 73% believe ""the government should continue paying Planned Parenthood for non-abortion services provided to people on Medicaid."" (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) A January 2017 poll by Quinnipiac found a lower figure: 62% opposed cutting off government funding to Planned Parenthood. When respondents learned that those dollars didn’t fund abortion, support went up to 80%.  Klobuchar’s campaign highlighted polling by progressive polling group PerryUndem. The poll does reference opposition of 90% against something related to defunding Planned Parenthood, but it’s different than what Klobuchar said. The question refers to adults who opposed an agenda that ""includes defunding Planned Parenthood,"" but also includes steps such as nominating Supreme Court Justices who expressly oppose abortion. Even PerryUndem found that, on the specific issue of of defunding Planned Parenthood, 70% of respondents expressed opposition. Those are significant numbers for what has long been a lightning rod of the culture wars. But they aren’t the statistic Klobuchar cited. Our ruling Klobuchar cited two statistics at the debate: More than 70% of Americans support Roe vs. Wade, and more than 90% support funding Planned Parenthood. Both these ideas appear to have majority support. But we couldn’t find compelling evidence for the 90% figure — polls focused on this particular issue suggest support is somewhat lower. With one of these statistics correct, and the other based on a different, broader polling question, we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0BAD00>],/factchecks/2019/nov/21/amy-klobuchar/klobuchar-leans-support-roe-v-wade-planned-parenth/
"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Mike Pence']","
Mike Pence right about Wisconsin jobs increase
","Visiting Wisconsin to tout economic progress and push for an updated North American trade deal, Vice President Mike Pence made the case that Wisconsin is better off than it was before President Donald Trump. During the campaign, Trump said he would be ""the greatest jobs president God ever created.""  So, it was little surprise Pence built his claim around job numbers. ""Since President (Donald Trump’s) election, 36,000 jobs have been created in WI,"" Pence tweeted while on his way to visit shipbuilder Fincantieri Marinette Marine in northeastern Wisconsin. We’ve tackled several claims on manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin: We rated the Democratic National Committee Mostly False for claiming a decline in manufacturing jobs last year meant Trump broke a campaign pledge to bring such jobs back. And we explained how it is largely accurate to say Wisconsin manufacturing jobs are both up under Trump or to say they’re down in the last year. But Pence’s claim is broader, so we’ll give this another go. Pence’s claim largely matches up with the latest jobs data, and actually understates the change a bit. The number of jobs in Wisconsin rose from 2.94 million in January 2017 — when Trump was sworn in — to 2.98 million in October 2019, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s a difference of 40,900. Those tallies show non-farm, seasonally adjusted jobs from the agency’s Current Employment Statistics — an estimate based on a monthly survey of a sampling of companies. But the gap is about the same using other breakdowns of the data. For example, Wisconsin’s job count has risen by 44,400 since January 2017 if you look at BLS data for all private-sector jobs (eliminating government positions from the equation).  But this uptick isn’t exactly a new phenomenon. The number of Wisconsin jobs has risen every year since 2010, when the trend headed up nationally in the wake of the Great Recession. And recent data tells a different story. The monthly jobs data shows a loss of 9,300 jobs from January 2019 to October 2019. Which brings us to the implication in Pence’s claim — that Trump deserves credit for the uptick since 2017. Experts say you can’t give a president full credit or full blame for job gains (or losses) on their watch. ""The President can claim some credit for creating an economic environment nationally in which jobs are being created,"" Abdur Chowdhury, professor emeritus of economics at Marquette University, said in an email. ""However … there are many local factors which affect job creation at the state level including, but not limited to, state employment policy,  business environment, national economic trends, tax policy, etc."" Dennis Winters, chief economist for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, cautioned against giving Trump too much credit in our earlier examination of state manufacturing jobs. He noted Trump took office during an ""expanding business cycle"" that would inherently lead to more jobs. Pence said 36,000 jobs have been created in Wisconsin since Trump took office. It’s an oversimplification to imply, as Pence does, that Trump deserves the credit for that bump. Jobs have actually trended in the other direction so far this year -- and changes in either direction are the product of many factors, not just who occupies the Oval Office. But Pence’s number lines ups with — and actually understates — the gains since January 2017, according to the latest data.  For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, our rating is Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A468140>],/factchecks/2019/nov/21/mike-pence/mike-pence-right-about-wisconsin-jobs-increase/

In a tweet following Yovanovitch’s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Nov. 15, Meadows wrote: ""For Washington Democrats and pundits who are incredulous that @realDonaldTrump recalled an ambassador, certain that it must be evidence of a conspiracy…  President Obama fired every Bush appointed ambassador upon his election."" We wondered whether it was true that Obama fired all of Bush’s politically-appointed ambassadors. There are two breeds of ambassadors: political appointees and career diplomats.  Political appointees are usually stationed in countries that are U.S. allies or desirable locations, like the Bahamas. These plum jobs are often awarded to the president’s friends and donors. They step aside when a new president is elected. Peter Feaver, a political scientist at Duke University, said, ""It is customary for political ambassadors to rotate out within the first several months of a change in administration precisely because one of their top assets — their closeness to the occupant of the Oval Office — disappears with the departing president."" Those are the people who cycled out when Obama took office. That’s standard practice. In his tweet, Meadows linked to a Washington Post article from Dec. 2008 to back up his claim. The article said that the Obama administration told all of Bush’s politically-appointed ambassadors to vacate their posts by Jan. 20. But we found at least a couple of examples of Bush’s politically-appointed ambassadors staying in their posts past Inauguration Day, which also is standard practice.  One example: Bush appointee Victor Ashe told PolitiFact that the Obama team asked him to continue serving as ambassador to Poland until his successor was confirmed. He ended up staying for nine months into Obama’s first term. ""I was flattered,"" Ashe said. ""I thought it was a tribute to my service, that I acted in a nonpartisan way."" A Snopes article from 2017 concluded, ""We found similar examples of presidents allowing ambassadors appointed by their predecessors to remain at their posts past Inauguration Day for every presidential transition dating back to 1977, when Jimmy Carter succeeded Gerald Ford."" So, it’s not accurate to say that Obama ""fired every Bush appointed ambassador."" Indeed, he wasn’t even the one to ask for their resignations. Ashe told us that the ambassadors received notice from the Bush White House requesting a letter of resignation effective Jan. 20, 2009. In routine fashion, they obliged. Many of Bush’s political appointees left their posts by Inauguration Day, but Ashe and some others were asked to withdraw their resignations and stay on during the transition, Ashe said.  It’s important to note that Yovanovitch’s case is different. She is a career diplomat, not a political appointee, who has served under three presidents. Also, she was ousted more than two years into Trump’s presidency, not during a transition period. Career diplomats hold the majority of ambassadorships. They are foreign service officers who rose through the ranks, often serving for decades before becoming ambassadors. While it’s customary for political appointees to cycle out when a new president takes office, career diplomats usually stay in their posts. In his tweet, Meadows tried to characterize Yovanovitch’s removal as routine — and Democrats’ criticisms about Yovanovitch’s ouster as invalid. But he’s applying the practice of replacing political appointees — and wrongly characterizing what Obama did, to a large extent — to career diplomats. Meadows claimed that Obama ""fired"" all of Bush’s politically-appointed ambassadors.  There’s an element of truth to that — they rotated out of their positions as political appointees do with every administration —  but Obama did not ""fire"" them. Indeed, Ashe told us it was actually the Bush White House that asked for his resignation. That was routine, unlike Yovanovitch’s removal. And at least a couple of political appointees, including Ashe, actually stayed months into Obama’s presidency. We rate this claim Mostly False. Correction: In the first reference to Ashe, we've corrected the sentence to say ""successor"" rather ""predecessor.""",[<zip object at 0x00000280976A1700>],/factchecks/2019/nov/21/mark-meadows/no-obama-didnt-fire-all-bushs-politically-appointe/

Do 160 million Americans really like their health plans? Kind of
","Articulating his proposal for health care reform, former Vice President Joe Biden emphasized the number of Americans who, he said, were more than perfectly satisfied with the coverage they have.  ""160 million people like their private insurance,"" Biden said during the November Democratic presidential primary debate.   That argument is at the heart of many moderate Democrats’ criticism of the ""Medicare for All"" proposal backed by Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.. We decided to take a closer look. We reached out to the Biden campaign for comment. The campaign directed us to his next point — that people who don’t like their private coverage could, under his health plan, opt into government-sponsored coverage. 160 million, and some squishy polling The figure appears to refer to the number of Americans who receive health benefits through work — so-called ""employer-sponsored health insurance."" Under Medicare for All, that would no longer be an option. On first blush, polling seems to suggest that most people with employer-sponsored coverage like it. Polling done earlier this year by the Kaiser Family Foundation with the Los Angeles Times found that most beneficiaries are ""generally satisfied"" with this insurance. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) But that doesn’t get at the whole story.  ""Most like their policy, but not all,"" said Robert Blendon, a health care pollster at Harvard T.H.  Chan School of Public Health. The context matters. In the same KFF/L.A. Times poll, about 40% of people with employer-sponsored coverage said they had trouble paying medical bills, out-of-pocket costs or premiums. About half indicated going without or delaying health care because — even with this coverage — it was unaffordable. And about 17% reported making ""difficult sacrifices"" to pay for health care.  Beneficiaries who have higher deductible plans — that is, they are required to pay larger sums of out-of-pocket before health coverage kicks in — are less likely to be happy with their coverage, and more likely to report problems paying for health care.  And it’s worth noting that these high-deductible plans have grown increasingly common, even for the 160 million Americans who get insurance from work, though that trend may now be losing steam. Research from the Commonwealth Fund, meanwhile, notes that increasing numbers of ""underinsured"" people do in fact have employer-sponsored health insurance. Underinsured people are those who have coverage but delay care because they still can’t afford it.  Meanwhile, other polling, such as a January Gallup survey, suggests that about 7 in 10 Americans believe the nation’s health care system is in crisis.  So while Americans may individually not express frustration with their specific private plans, more are learning that, when they try to actually use that coverage, it doesn’t meet their health needs.  These findings cast significant shade on the idea that all 160 million Americans with employer-sponsored coverage actually like it. Our ruling Biden argued that ""160 million people like their private insurance."" A cursory look at polling would suggest that most of the people he’s talking about — Americans who get coverage through work — are happy with their plans.  But once you dig a little deeper, that narrative gets more complicated. Even while Americans say they like their plans, large proportions indicate that the private coverage they have still leaves meaningful gaps, requiring them to skip or delay health care because they cannot afford it.  Biden’s argument is technically correct, but it leaves out important context and relies on a somewhat squishy number. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A45A4C0>],/factchecks/2019/nov/21/joe-biden/do-160-million-americans-like-their-health-insur/

Kamala Harris' claim about typical dad paying higher taxes than 400 richest families is Mostly False
","One theme U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris sounds in her 2020 presidential campaign is that ""justice is on the ballot."" The California Democrat did so repeatedly in a Facebook video ad, which leads off with this claim: ""In America, there is a father who is holding down two jobs and paying more taxes than the richest 400 families in America."" Her statement is based on a study that produced startling headlines, such as one in the Washington Post: ""For the first time in history, U.S. billionaires paid a lower tax rate than the working class last year."" But Harris misfired by making her claim about taxes paid instead of tax rates. Also, the study, while produced by two prominent economists, makes estimates based on assumptions that are not universally accepted among economists. The study, published as a book about a month before Harris’ claim, was done by leading economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, whose work PolitiFact has relied on for previous fact-checks.  Harris’ campaign told us Harris was referring to rates, even though that isn’t what Harris said. The study said that in 2018, the average effective tax rate paid by the bottom half of American households was 24.2% — a full percentage point higher than the 23% rate paid by the 400 richest families.  As the book puts it, ""the Trumps, the Zuckerbergs and the Buffetts of this world pay lower tax rates than teachers and secretaries."" So, to use Harris’ example, a typical father with two jobs pays a higher tax rate than the richest 400 American families — according to one study by prominent economists.  That’s not the same as paying more taxes. Indeed, an individual with $1 million in taxable income would pay roughly $230,000 in all federal and state taxes, Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, told us. Someone with $50,000 in taxable income would pay about $12,000. Moreover, the study Harris relied on makes estimates for 2018, and its methodology has come in for criticism from some economists. That isn’t to say that the study is wrong or that the critics are right. But the picture isn’t as clear as Harris’ statement suggests. Federal tax data for 2018 were not available, so the Saez-Zucman study had to do extrapolations, Gleckman wrote in a critique of the study. That is ""no easy feat,"" because of fundamental changes made by the 2017 Republican tax cuts; plus, the study excluded certain federal tax credits received by lower- and middle-income people. The upshot, according to Gleckman:  Incomes of the very rich are rising faster than for all other income groups, and Trump’s tax law cut the taxes of high earners by more on average than for low- and moderate-income households; ""but that doesn’t mean that billionaires paid a lower tax rate than the working class."" A similar criticism was made by economists Aparna Mathur of the American Enterprise Institute and Kyle Pomerleau of the Tax Foundation.  The Saez-Zucman study, they wrote, ""rests on several unconventional methodological assumptions which, in our opinion, biases the outcome towards finding relatively lower tax rates on the wealthy compared to the poor and overstates the decline in top earners’ tax burdens."" David Splinter, an economist at Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation, also found fault with the Saez-Zucman study’s methodology and conclusion that tax rates are nearly equal for people at opposite ends of the income scale. The joint committee, the Tax Policy Center, the U.S. Treasury, the Congressional Budget Office and economists all have found that federal taxes are progressive, he wrote in a critique of the study. The study’s assumptions, Tax Foundation economist Erica York told us, ""go against the widely-accepted methods that exist for determining tax burdens, without providing a convincing reason for doing so."" Saez referred us to a frequently asked questions web page that explains the study’s rationale and addresses some of the criticism. University of Wisconsin-Madison economist Andrew Reschovsky praised the study, but called Harris’ claim misleading. ""In dollar terms, the father holding down two jobs is certainly paying less in taxes than the taxes paid by the richest families,"" Reschovsky told us. ""What Harris should have said, is that the father holding down two jobs is paying a larger share of his income in taxes than the average richest families are paying in taxes relative to their incomes."" But, again, that scenario comes from a study that is in some dispute. Harris said, ""In America, there is a father who is holding down two jobs and paying more taxes than the richest 400 families in America."" The study Harris relies on estimates that a typical taxpayer pays a higher tax rate on federal, state and local taxes — not that he pays more in actual taxes — than do the richest families. And even on rates, the difference is not especially large: 24.2% vs. 23%.  That’s important because, while the study was done by leading economists, it relies on estimates and a methodology that some economists say makes the tax system look less progressive than it actually is. Most critically, there is nothing in Harris’ ad that suggested she was talking about tax rates rather than taxes paid.  For a statement that contains only an element of truth, we give Harris a Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D8F080>],/factchecks/2019/nov/21/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-claim-about-typical-dad-paying-more-/

No, gruesome photo of tortured man isn’t Benghazi victim Chris Stevens
","On Sept. 11, 2012, terrorists attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, resulting in the deaths of four Americans.

PolitiFact fact-checked the claim when it first surfaced and found it to be a combination of fabrication and unsupported speculation. We rated it Pants on Fire.

Facebook screens the troubling torture image from viewers until they click on an ""Uncover Photo"" icon, warning first that, ""This photo may show violent or graphic content."" As we previously reported, speculation that Stevens was raped and tortured prior to his death is unsupported. The rumor does not line up with government reviews of the attack and its aftermath, or with contemporaneous media reports and video footage. A website called ""The Meme Policeman"" reported that it found the photo on the internet as early as 2004 when it appeared in a story by Spanish newspaper Diario de León about Argentinian military torture. We can’t verify that it was shared that early, as the article’s link no longer works, and it doesn’t appear in a search of internet archives.  Nevertheless, we did find the image posted on various blogs as early as 2009. As well, a reverse-image search shows versions of the photo on the internet as early as 2008 –– four years before Stevens’ death. Various blog posts make a myriad of claims about the image’s origin. It has been used to illustrate articles about Spanish war crimes, Argentinian war crimes and CIA torture in Afghanistan.

The image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This caption is not accurate. The pack is being led by one animal, with the rest following in a single-file line to save energy.  The image was taken by Chadden Hunter in 2011 for the BBC series and features a pack of timberwolves hunting bison in Canada’s Wood Buffalo National Park. The original caption reads: ""A massive pack of 25 timberwolves hunting bison on the Arctic circle in northern Canada. In mid-winter in Wood Buffalo National Park temperatures hover around -40C. The wolf pack, led by the alpha female, travel single-file through the deep snow to save energy. The size of the pack is a sign of how rich their prey base is during winter when the bison are more restricted by poor feeding and deep snow. The wolf packs in this National Park are the only wolves in the world that specialise in hunting bison ten times their size. They have grown to be the largest and most powerful wolves on earth."" However, despite the popular understanding of how wolf packs work, some scientists dispute the term ""alpha."" In the 1999 paper, ""Alpha Status, Dominance, and Division of Labor in Wolf Packs,"" wolf expert L. David Mech wrote that, in natural wolf packs, the alpha male or female are ""merely the parents of the packs."" Mech said that after years of observation he saw no dominance contests among wild wolves. ""Calling a wolf an alpha is usually no more appropriate than referring to a human parent or a doe deer as an alpha,"" Mech wrote. ""Any parent is dominant to its young offspring, so ‘alpha’ adds no information. Why not refer to an alpha female as the female parent, the breeding female, the matriarch, or simply the mother? Such a designation emphasizes not the animal’s dominant status, which is trivial information, but its role as pack progenitor, which is critical information."" The photograph in the post is real and unaltered, but its caption is incorrect. The pack is not being led by the older, sick wolves and the ""alpha"" or leader wolf is not bringing up the rear.

NC Republican tells half the story about teacher pay vetoes
","When it comes to teacher pay, Republicans and Democrats say the other side isn’t doing enough. And, with elections less than a year away, Republicans are slamming Gov. Roy Cooper for using his veto power. NC Rep. David Lewis, a Republican from Harnett County, recently tweeted about Cooper’s history of vetoing proposals passed by the legislature. ""Gov. Cooper just vetoed another pay raise that the #NCGA passed, as he has every single teacher pay raise we've ever passed,"" Lewis tweeted. Lewis went on to say that he’s ""tired of Cooper using teachers as political pawns, blocking their raises then trying to convince them he cares."" Is it true that Cooper has vetoed every proposed teacher raise the legislature has passed since January 2017, when he took office? Contacted by PolitiFact, Lewis spokesman David Capen said in an email that Cooper has vetoed four opportunities to raise teacher pay. Lewis is suggesting that Cooper is opposed to raises in teacher pay. But, when you look at the reason Cooper vetoed the proposals, you’ll see Cooper hoped to secure better raises for teachers. Cooper vetoed: Seeking higher raises Cooper vetoed the GOP proposals in hopes of negotiating even higher raises. But the governor and Republican legislative leaders have yet to strike a deal. ""Every budget Governor Cooper proposed has contained significantly higher teacher pay raises than the Republican budgets, which deserved vetoes because they shortchanged teachers and prioritized corporate tax cuts,"" Cooper spokeswoman Megan Thorpe said in an email. For example, she said Cooper’s budget sought to pay first-year teachers $37,500. That’s $2,500 more than the legislative budget proposal, according to the governor’s office. The gap was wider for experienced teachers, Thorpe said. For teachers with 30 years of experience, Cooper proposed $58,000 and the legislature proposed $53,100. Political drama aside, some teachers will get more money in their checks this year. Cooper signed the Teacher Step Act earlier this month, authorizing raises for teachers who had previously qualified for them (by adding another year of work experience.) But Lewis and others don’t consider that signature to be progress in the debate over long-term teacher pay. Step raises The Teacher Step Act authorized raises that had been previously-approved. In other words, the legislation didn’t enact a new raise structure -- which is at the heart of the teacher pay debate. But it did have a real-world effect of funnelling more money into teachers’ pockets. ""Step increases are not considered ‘raises’ in the traditional sense, as teachers (and other educators paid on the step schedule) earn them based on years of service,"" Mark Jewell, president of the N.C. Association of Educators, told PolitiFact in an email. Jewell told the News & Observer in October that lawmakers shouldn’t get any credit for funding step increases that are required under state law. ""It’s state law that teachers get their steps based on the step schedule, so in this case all the step bill did was fully fund what was already guaranteed,"" he told PolitiFact. Still, even though the raises had been previously negotiated, Cooper’s signature was key. Under the State Budget Act, no step increases are actually funded without legislative approval. (see page 22). PolitiFact ruling Lewis said Cooper has vetoed ""every single teacher pay raise we’ve ever passed."" While this is technically accurate, it suggests that Cooper opposes teacher pay raises -- which isn’t true. In fact, Cooper vetoed the proposed raises in hopes of securing more money for educators. And his approval of step raises shows he’s not blocking teachers from the money they’re owed. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details that might give the public a different impression of the situation.

Donald Trump gets Ukraine phone memo timeline backwards
","President Donald Trump argues that his July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky was ""perfect,"" and that Democrats have distorted it to build their case for impeachment. In an interview with conservative show host Dan Bongino, Trump said a false rendition of that call by House Intelligence chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., forced him to release the readout of that call. ""They never thought, Dan, that I was going to release that call, and I really had no choice because Adam Schiff made up a call,"" Trump said Nov. 15. ""He said the president said this, and then he made up a call."" The problem with Trump’s statement is that Schiff spoke after the White House released the memo of the phone call, not before. Sept. 9, 2019: Michael Atkinson, inspector general of the intelligence community, notifies Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, that there was a whistleblower complaint of ""urgent concern.""  Sept. 19, 2019: Atkinson briefs the House Intelligence Committee in a closed-door session. Sept. 24, 2019: House Democrats launch a formal impeachment inquiry.  Sept. 25, 2019: The White House releases a declassified summary of the July 25 telephone call between Trump and Zelensky. Sept. 26, 2019: Schiff makes opening remarks at a hearing with Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence. Maguire was questioned because he had not forwarded the inspector general’s findings to conference.  At that Sept. 26 hearing, Schiff offered a dramatized synopsis of Trump’s call with Zelensky. He described rhetorically the nature of Trump’s message to Ukraine. Trump later latched on to Schiff’s words, saying he was lying to the public. ""Rep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine,"" Trump tweeted Sept. 30. Rep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason? We can find no other version of Schiff describing the call before the summary emerged. We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. Trump said that the White House released a summary of his call with Zelensky after Schiff gave a false rendition of the call.  The summary came out before Schiff described the nature of the call at a hearing. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2C3F00>],/factchecks/2019/nov/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-schiff-ukraine-timeline-phone-memo/

No evidence for Trump's claim that Pelosi, Schiff promised to impeach him before he took office
","In a Facebook ad that started running Nov. 14, the day after the first public hearing of the impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump declared: ""Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and the rest of the corrupt Democrats made a promise to their crazy left-wing base that they would impeach me even BEFORE I took office."" Did the two California House members — Speaker Pelosi and impeachment inquiry leader Schiff — and other Democrats pledge to impeach Trump even before his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017? We found no evidence of it. In fact, Pelosi and Schiff long resisted calls by other Democrats for the current impeachment inquiry. There was some early talk about possible impeachment. In April 2016 — before Trump even won the GOP nomination — Politico reported that there was talk of impeaching Trump soon after he took office, were he to be nominated for the presidency and win. Then-U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., said at the time that if Trump insisted on building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border despite Congress’s opposition, his actions could lead down a path toward impeachment. In December 2016, five Democratic senators, including 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, announced they would introduce a bill to require Trump to divest assets that could pose a conflict of interest in his role as president. They said the legislation would symbolically make violations of federal conflict-of-interest rules ""a high crime or misdemeanor under the impeachment clause of the U.S. Constitution."" But those are only examples of Democrats raising the possibility of impeachment — far short of promising to do it. And Pelosi and Schiff were not involved. The same is true of two statements cited to us by the Republican National Committee to back Trump’s claim in the ad. (The ad, by the way, was placed by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a joint fundraising committee composed of the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. As of Sept. 30, 2019, it had raised more than $96 million during 2019, according to the latest figures from the Federal Election Commission.) 1. A Schiff tweet on Dec. 22, 2016, said: ""There’s no question the Emoluments Clause applies to POTUS – including Trump. Severe remedies if its violated, including impeachment."" The Constitution’s emoluments clause bars officials from receiving payments from foreign entities and is the basis for lawsuits challenging foreign payments to Trump’s Washington hotel. It has rarely been tested in court. At the time, the federal Office of Government Ethics was urging Trump to sell his business holdings as the ""only way to resolve these conflicts of interest."" Similarly, Schiff was calling on the president-elect to ""divest completely,"" raising impeachment as one possible consequence if Trump didn’t, but not pledging to impeach. 2. U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, another California Democrat, said four days before the inauguration that if there was evidence the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians by using hacked information from Democratic National Committee emails against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, it would be an impeachable offense. Waters has repeatedly called for Trump’s impeachment, but those demands didn’t start until the months after Trump took office. The RNC didn’t provide us any information about Pelosi. A Pelosi spokesman denied to us that Pelosi ever promised before Trump took office that she would seek to impeach him.  It’s also important to note that Pelosi and Schiff long resisted calls by other Democrats to initiate an impeachment inquiry. Pelosi launched the inquiry, in September 2019, only after evidence emerged Trump allegedly pressured the president of Ukraine to open a corruption investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son. Trump said, ""Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and the rest of the corrupt Democrats made a promise to their crazy left-wing base that they would impeach me even BEFORE I took office."" The Republican National Committee, on Trump’s behalf, cited no evidence of such promises and we did not find any. We rate Trump’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AC1E00>],/factchecks/2019/nov/19/donald-trump/no-evidence-trumps-claim-pelosi-schiff-promised-im/
