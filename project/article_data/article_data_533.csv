Scott Walker says 2013 job growth in Wisconsin was best since 1990s
","In the wake of formally launching his re-election bid, Gov. Scott Walker is rolling out a new jobs statistic to combat criticism over the pace of Wisconsin’s employment recovery. ""You don’t hear this from a lot of the other media outlets out there, and you certainly don’t read about it in most of the newspapers in the state,"" Walker told conservative talker Jay Weber on Milwaukee’s WISN-AM (1130) April 16, 2014.  ""In 2013 we had the largest, the best, private sector job growth we’ve had in this state since the 1990s."" Now, it’s been well documented that Wisconsin’s private-sector job growth has trailed the national average and Walker is lagging on his promise of adding 250,000 private sector jobs in his first term. Despite all that, did Wisconsin job growth in 2013 outpace gains in every year for nearly the last decade and a half? Digging into the numbers When we asked Walker’s office to provide backup, his spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster pointed to monthly jobs estimates based on government surveys of a small sample of employers. Those numbers showed that 2013’s private job-growth of 39,700 is the highest since 1999’s 55,700. To be sure, those numbers are far less reliable than the job-count data reported in the U.S. Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which tallies job creation from a census of 96 percent of the nation’s employers. Notably, over the last three years Walker has criticized the monthly numbers as unreliable, arguing for using the quarterly figures. Here, he does the opposite. But the latest figures from the more-reliable quarterly census run only through September 2013, so we think it’s fair game for the governor to use them, though as we shall see they are subject to change. The year-end 2013 figures are expected out in June. Researchers we spoke to said the percentage of growth is a better measure because economies grow over time. By that measure, the 1.66 percent growth in 2013 also was the best since 1999’s 2.37 percent. The numbers didn’t surprise Laura Dresser, who tracks Wisconsin’s employment picture as labor economist and associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, a nonprofit think tank. Two national recessions bookended the 2000s, Dresser noted, with the one early in the decade spawning the phrase ""jobless recovery."" Three years (2001 and 2008-09 in the Great Recession) saw big job losses in Wisconsin’s private market. And the state’s job total still hasn’t rebounded to 2007 pre-recession highs. Digging a little deeper There are multiple ways to slice jobs data. So hang with us, there’s a bit of technical job-count speak ahead. Walker’s figures are based on seasonally adjusted data for December each year. Under this counting method, actual changes in job growth are adjusted to account for cyclical economic factors such as weather, vacation periods and holidays. But some researchers prefer to use unadjusted figures, saying the seasonal adjustments are not necessary when comparing year-over-year changes. (The most important thing is to use one or the other method consistently.) The counts can vary significantly. In fact, the unadjusted figures for 2013 show 15,000 fewer jobs created in 2012 than the seasonally adjusted figures. At this point, using unadjusted figures, the 2013 result (24,400 jobs added) trails five years, namely, 2004, 2005, 2010, 2011 and 2012 which ranged from 28,100 to 39,000 jobs added. ""If he is talking about actual counts of jobs, this is the number you want to use,"" Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, told us. Others are fine with the seasonally adjusted data that backs up Walker’s claim. It’s frequently used in year-over-year comparisons published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official scorekeeper on job growth. Seasonally adjusted figures have several advantages and are more familiar to the general public than other types of data, BLS economists told us. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue uses it as well. Dresser, of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, uses the seasonally adjusted data for annual comparisons, but said the unadjusted data is defensible as well. PolitiFact Wisconsin tracks Walker’s progress on his 250,000 jobs promise in part using seasonally adjusted figures. Our ""Walk-O-Meter"" includes a footnote that explains we combine the more reliable quarterly census data with the latest monthly survey data to come up with the ""best available"" up-to-date figures for the current month. In the end, Walker’s claim may have a limited shelf life. That’s because the monthly survey numbers have not gone through final revisions for the fourth quarter of 2013. Those revisions are made based on what happens with the more accurate quarterly-census data, so it is still a bit of a moving target. Based on past changes, the revision -- expected this summer -- could be large. ""To know how many jobs were added in 2013, we just have to wait for the (quarterly census) data,"" said Knapp. Our rating Walker said that ""in 2013 we had the largest, the best, private sector job growth we’ve had in this state since the 1990s."" The claim is accurate based on the best available data source and using a common method of comparison. But it needs some clarification because the number is not final, so the ranking is subject to change. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/apr/27/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-2013-job-growth-wisconsin-was-be/

Raimondo touts having cleared 900 claims in backlogged victims’ fund
","As a candidate for governor, state General Treasurer Gina Raimondo has been touting her experience in the venture capital business as an asset when it comes to running the treasurer’s office, and possibly the rest of state government. On her campaign website, under the headline ""Making Government Work,"" she says she implemented a strategy to streamline management in her office. As evidence, she claims that under her tenure, the treasurer’s office cleared a 900-claim backlog in the state Crime Victim Compensation Program that had been building up for years. She makes a similar claim on the treasurer’s website. We decided to check her claim on those claims. The Crime Victim Compensation Program pays grants to Rhode Island crime victims or their family members. Awards can be used to help pay for expenses such as health insurance deductibles, medical care, lost wages, mental health therapy, crime scene cleanup or funeral costs. Individual victims often file more than one claim, but the maximum amount any one person can receive is $25,000. Most of the program’s money comes from fines and assessments levied in the state courts, augmented by federal funds.   When we asked Raimondo’s office for backup, her staff provided a breakdown of the unresolved claim backlog that they said they found after sorting through the compensation program’s files when she took office in 2011. It comprised 912 claims by 415 people. The names of the individuals and the doctors or health care providers who were paid were redacted from the documents we received. Treasurer’s office spokeswoman Joy Fox said fund staffers began going through the paperwork in the files around the middle of 2011, finishing around November. During that time they found instances in which claims had been filed but not decided, and others in which claims had been approved but not paid. The accounting listed the date that each backlogged claim was filed, how much was sought, when it was approved or denied, how much was awarded if it had been approved, when the check was issued and the check number. The earliest claim went back to 2007. After the list was compiled, Fox said the effort to resolve them began in January 2012. According to the payment accounting from Raimondo’s office, by June of 2012 about 95 percent of the claims had resolved. The remainder, 47 claims, were finished by December 2012. Since then, the average wait time for a new claim to be resolved is 28.9 days, the treasurer’s office said in its 2013 annual report on the program to the General Assembly. Of the 912 claims, 391 were approved for some kind of award, about 43 percent. The total amount paid out on those came to $681,890.67. We wanted to find independent verification of that figure.   So we went to the treasurer’s office online ""transparency portal,"" which lists the checks issued by the state in given fiscal years. We looked for the 391 checks on the backlog list and found 310 matches -- enough to give us confidence in Raimondo’s figure. Fox said the rest don’t show individually on the transparency portal because the state consolidates multiple payments to single health care service providers into a single combined number for each payee. Our ruling Gina Raimondo said her office was able to resolve 900 pending claims from the state’s Crime Victim Compensation Program since she became general treasurer in 2011. Her staff provided an accounting that outlined the effort. It showed 912 claims resolved, 12 more than she said. We independently verified enough of the claims to rule her statement True.

Democrats say Ed Gillespie's book promoted individual mandates
","Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie rarely leaves a microphone without criticizing Democrat incumbent Mark Warner’s 2009 vote for Obamacare. The Democratic Party of Virginia says the attacks are hypocritical, maintaining that Gillespie once embraced a policy that is at the heart of President Barack Obama’s health reform law -- an individual mandate that most Americans have insurance or pay a penalty. ""Gillespie’s memoir promotes an individual health care mandate, and recommends that it be enforced by the IRS through the income tax code,"" the party stated in a March 24 news release. The Democrats were pointing to words that Gillespie -- a former White House adviser and chairman of the Republican National Committee -- wrote in his 2006 book, ""Winning Right: Campaign politics and conservative policies."" We wondered if Gillespie’s memoir really did promote an individual mandate for health insurance -- the bane of many conservatives who oppose Obamacare. Under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, Americans without health coverage start paying a penalty this year. By 2016, the levy grows to $2,085 per family or 2.5 percent of household income -- whichever is greater. Certain tax filers facing financial hardship and other situations are exempt. Paul Logan, Gillespie’s campaign spokesman, told us in an e-mail that ""Ed never supported the individual mandate."" Gillespie made a similar statement to the Washington Examiner last December, before he announced his candidacy. ""If I run against Sen. Warner, my critique of Obamacare will be consistent with my past positions in opposition to an individual mandate and too much government intrusion in our health care sector,"" he said. But Democrats point to a 2006 book passage in which Gillespie wrote that health care reforms should ensure that uncovered adults gain health care insurance so they won’t remain ""free riders"" who get care at others’ expense. ""A more rational approach is to ensure that every emancipated adult capable of providing for his or her health care do so,"" Gillespie wrote. ""One way to accomplish this is to use the tax code to gain compliance. Annual filers would have to attest that they have some form of health coverage or else the ‘standard deduction’ on their income tax would be cut in half."" Right after this passage, Gillespie discussed another way to ensure all adults provide for their own health care. ""Another approach would be the creation of tax-free Health Savings Accounts that would be refunded after a certain period for any use,"" he wrote. ""If after seven years, an individual didn’t use his HSA funds for health care, the money would be treated like an income tax refund. The inducement of tax-free savings for those who are healthy would provide an incentive for more people to obtain insurance coverage."". We twice asked Gillespie’s campaign why his suggestion to cut the standard deduction for uninsured people should not be considered support for a mandate. Logan did not provide a direct answer, saying Gillespie was writing about ""various proposals for reforming health care under consideration at the time."" Logan also pointed us to an op-ed earlier this month in Forbes in which Merrill Matthews, a resident scholar at the conservative Institute for Policy Innovation, said the passage In Gillespie’s book amounts to an ""anti-mandate approach."" Matthews told us he ""assumed"" that Gillespie, in his 2006 book, was endorsing an unsuccessful proposal President George W. Bush made one year later offering tax breaks to insured households. Bush’s ""carrot"" approach sought voluntary compliance; it did not mandate the purchase of health insurance, but would have rewarded most people who had coverage. That’s different from Obama’s ""stick"" approach of insisting people obtain coverage or face tax penalties. But Matthews added that the Gillespie campaign has never told him his assumption is correct and that Gillespie’s language in the book is unclear. Logan also pointed to a column from the conservative National Review magazine which said ""some of the language (‘ensure,’ compliance’) sounds pro-mandate, but the actual policies described strongly resemble the proposals of the Bush administration and of Paul Ryan, which very few conservatives have described as the equivalent of a mandate."" We spoke to two health care experts who had a different take on Gillespie’s prose.   Ted Marmor, a professor of health policy at Yale University, told us the policy Gillespie described is ""the functional equivalent of an individual mandate without using the words mandate and fine."" ""Absolutely, that’s an individual mandate,"" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Libertarian Cato Institute, after reading Gillespie’s passage. Tanner said the passage sounds like an endorsement Massachusetts health care reforms that then-Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, signed a few months before Gillespie’s book was published. The law imposed tax penalties on state residents who could afford insurance and refused to buy it. In November 2006, a few months after his book was released, Gillespie specifically weighed in on the Massachusetts plan. ""You see Mitt Romney in Massachusetts is taking some steps toward individual requirements for people to carry their own insurance. I think the party is probably open to that kind of approach,"" Gillespie told C-SPAN. ""Others are proposing small business health plans and greater transparency and putting the consumer closer in touch with the health care expenditure. I think that’s a good direction."" Logan, Gillespie’s spokesman, said the interview establishes his boss’s mindset: While Gillespie opined that the GOP might be open to an individual mandate, Gillespie added he personally thought a ""good direction"" was to pursue a different approach. In ensuing years, Gillespie emerged as a steadfast opponent to the individual mandate in Obamacare. In November 2009, he told ABC News that the health reform bill under consideration was a ""monstrosity"" in part because of ""the mandates in it."" As our colleagues at PolitiFact National have reported, the individual mandate was discussed in Republican circles more than 15 years before Obamacare even existed. In 1993 some Republican senators signed onto a bill that would have required everyone to buy insurance. The legislation was an alternative to then President Bill Clinton’s failed health care reform plan that required employers to pay for insurance and then closely regulated insurers and health care providers. Our ruling Democrats said Gillespie’s book ""promoted an individual mandate."" Gillespie’s 2006 memoir states that one way of reforming health care is to require people to carry insurance or have their standard tax deduction cut in half. That fits the definition of an individual mandate. Gillespie’s campaign denies this is the case, but declines to provide a clear explanation. It should be noted that Gillespie offered tax consequences as one possibility for reforming health care. His book suggested Health Savings Account as another way to ensure adults get coverage. Webster’s New World College Dictionary defines ""promote"" as ""to help bring about"" something. Although it may not have been Gillespie’s intention, his unclear book passage can be easily interpreted as advancing the idea of individual mandates during a formative time for health policy. So we rate the Democrats’ claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/apr/27/democratic-party-virginia/democrats-say-ed-gillespies-book-promoted-individu/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Small Business', 'Stimulus', 'Texas', 'Young Conservatives of Texas']","
Company led by Ryan Sitton applied for government construction loan, but turned to private financing in the end
","The Young Conservatives of Texas said Ryan Sitton, a candidate for the Republican nomination for a seat on the Texas Railroad Commission, once tapped economic stimulus aid ushered into place by the Democratic president, Barack Obama. Those are fightin' words for GOP voters wary of Obama's fingerprints. The group, which has endorsed the candidate facing off with Sitton in a May 27, 2014, primary runoff, former state Rep. Wayne Christian, said in a March 13, 2014, press release that Sitton’s company, ""Pin(n)acleAIS, accepted over $650,000 in Obama stimulus dollars to expand their company."" This claim, which Sitton's campaign urged us to check, has been found faulty before. We divined why. Two web posts By email, Jenna White of Austin, executive director of YCT, told us a web post by the nonprofit journalism organization ProPublica and a business news story posted online were the basis of its claim. The undated ProPublica post, headlined ""How much stimulus funding is going to your county?,"" indicates that PinnacleAIS was awarded a Small Business Administration loan of $652,000 on Sept. 24, 2009. Sitton is president and CEO of Pasadena-based Pinnacle Asset Integrity Services, which describes itself as providing engineering consulting services and risk assessments.  A story posted online Jan. 19, 2010, by GlobeSt.com, a commercial real estate news organization, described PinnacleAIS as on track to break ground on its headquarters building in Pasadena. Financing, the story said, had been delayed. From the story: ""Sitton says PinnacleAIS didn’t have difficulty obtaining the financing, as the company is in strong financial shape. ‘This will be the first debt the company has taken on,’ he adds. Rather, the company’s executives decided to take advantage of stimulus funds and obtain financing through a U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loan, due to the better loan rates and less initial capital requirement. Dealing with a government entity like the SBA can take time, Sitton explains, but the attractive terms made it worth it."" Chief financial officer says loan never closed Those web posts were inaccurate, Sitton’s campaign manager, Jared Craighead, and Steve Cory, PinnacleAIS’s chief financial officer, told us by phone. The company won approval of the described loan, Cory said, but ultimately closed a conventional bank loan to help cover construction costs. Specifically, Cory said, the Small Business Administration loan, which he described as totaling $621,000, never was closed, as in finalized. Instead, Cory said, PinnacleAIS obtained financing through JPMorgan Chase--a decision reached in 2011, about two years after construction began. Cory said the company concluded the higher closing cost of the government loan made it less appealing than the bank-loan alternative. Cory said that after we brought up the ProPublica web post, Pinnacle asked ProPublica to make a correction. To our query, a ProPublica spokeswoman, Minhee Cho, told us its stimulus funds' database hadn’t been updated since 2012. She added that it drew on the USASpending.gov website, where we found four entries indicating Pinnacle has sought SBA loans, though there was nothing about a loan of $650,000 or so. This stimulus charge percolated in 2012 when Sitton sought a Texas House seat. According to a Feb. 13, 2014, Texas Tribune news story, Sitton said then that he sought but never took out an SBA loan, and while that agency got help under the stimulus package, so did many. According to the story, the federal database of stimulus awards ""shows none went to Pinnacle."" That also was the case when we checked the list April 24, 2014. Group changing message We circled back to White, who said by email the group would  amend its message. ""We are changing the verbiage to ‘applied for federal stimulus dollars’ in a corrected press release to reflect the new information,"" White wrote. Postscript: Craighead emailed us an April 24, 2014, letter from Laquita Cyprian, a Houston-based Chase vice president, stating PinnacleAIS obtained its funding for the building project entirely ""through conventional loan products by JPMorgan Chase."" Craighead also forwarded an April 25, 2014, email from Ryann Jones, a ProPublica data reporter, stating the organization had ""confirmed that PinnacleAIS’s entry in our Recovery Tracker is indeed outdated and we will be removing the entry as soon as possible."" Both messages originated after YCT made its claim, so we didn’t consider them in our analysis. In fairness, our fact checks must be derived from information already known or obtainable at the time a claim is made. Our ruling YCT said Sitton’s company ""accepted over $650,000 in Obama stimulus dollars."" The company applied for a government loan identified by ProPublica and a business news publication as stimulus money. But the Sitton-led company says the money never flowed. We found no indications to the contrary and a federal website that tracks stimulus spending has no PinnacleAIS entry. We rate this statement as False.",/factchecks/2014/apr/25/young-conservatives-texas/company-led-ryan-sitton-applied-government-constru/

Thom Tillis, Senate Majority PAC disagree on disgraced staffers
","Both Republican and Democratic super PACs are jumping in local races to criticize candidates this year. One tit-for-tat war has broken out in North Carolina, where the Senate Majority PAC, a pro-Democratic group, has publicized two-year-old dirt from the office of Thom Tillis, the state’s House Speaker and leading contender for the GOP Senate nomination. The Senate Majority PAC, which supports Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan, released an ad on April 15 reminding viewers of how two Tillis staffers -- one of whom he shared an apartment with -- got caught having affairs with lobbyists just days apart. ""Thom Tillis’ reaction?"" the narrator said. ""He claimed he was surprised by his roommate’s affair, but then rewarded both aides with taxpayer-paid bonuses."" The ad also specified that the staffers -- Charles Thomas and Amy Hobbs -- resigned. Tillis’ Democratic opponent, incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan, released a similar radio ad. Two days later, Tillis’ campaign offered a decidedly different take. ""Seen those ads attacking Thom Tillis?"" the narrator said. ""They’re false. Tillis fired the staffers."" Who’s right here? PolitiFact concludes that the Senate Majority PAC’s description of the situation -- not Tillis’ -- is closer to the truth. What happened in 2012 The News & Observer, a newspaper based in Raleigh, N.C., reported that Charles Thomas, Tillis’ chief of staff and roommate, resigned in April 2012 after his affair with a lobbyist was caught on video. Less than one week later, policy analyst Amy Hobbs resigned after an affair of her own was exposed, the paper reported. Tillis then offered the two former staffers a payment of one month’s salary -- $12,500 for Thomas and $6,833.33 for Hobbs. The listed purpose was ""payment in lieu of notice,"" a term he took from Wikipedia that referred to a British policy. Under North Carolina law, Tillis wasn’t obligated to pay either staffer a month’s salary upon resignation. In defending his decision to pay staffers, Tillis said, ""I stand by my decision to accept their resignation while recognizing the difficult transition period they are now entering."" In other words, Tillis at the time did not claim that he had fired the staffers -- only accepted their resignations. This supports the pro-Democratic ad, and clashes with what Tillis’ 2014 ad claims. Indeed, after our colleagues at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker expressed skepticism about Tillis’ ad, his office now appears to be backing off the term ""fired."" ""Speaker Tillis initiated the action that resulted in the termination of employment. He asked for their resignations,"" Tillis spokesman Jordan Shaw told PolitiFact. That’s closer to Tillis’ initial phrasing, that he ""accepted"" the resignations, but it’s still not the same thing as ""fired."" And in any case, Tillis’ response ad was not aired with the ""forced resignations"" terminology that Tillis’ office began using after the fact. Our ruling Tillis’ ad called a pro-Democratic ad ""false"" for saying that he allowed two disgraced staffers in 2012 to ""resign."" But the news coverage at the time painted a different picture -- he accepted their resignations. This generally supports the Democratic ad’s description, so we rate Tillis’ claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/apr/25/thom-tillis/thom-tillis-senate-majority-pac-disagree-disgraced/

Social media meme says 300,000 suicides are attributable to foreclosures
","A reader recently asked us to check a social media meme with a striking statistic about foreclosures and suicides. It said, ""1.4 million homes stolen by banks since 2008. Over 300K home owner suicides attributed to foreclosures. Why won't anyone defend these American property owners' rights?"" Have there really been 300,000 suicides linked to foreclosures? We decided to take a look. We first checked with the group credited with creating the meme -- a news and opinion site called occupycorporatism.com -- but an email to the site’s general inbox was not returned. So we next checked annual death statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most recent report came out in December 2013, covering statistics for 2010. For 2010, CDC found that suicide was the 10th most common cause of death, with 38,364 cases. Here’s the number for the past nine years:   Year Suicides 2010 38,364 2009 36,909 2008 36,035 2007 34,598 2006 33,300 2005 32,637 2004 32,439 2003 31,484 2002 31,655 Total, 2002-10 307,151   So the total number of suicides from 2002-10 is around 300,000. But for the meme to be correct, you’d have to believe that every single American suicide between 2002 and 2010 was caused by a foreclosure.  Of course, that assumes there was a reliable way to measure this kind of causal effect. (The CDC reports don't address what caused a person to commit suicide.) And the meme is even further off-base it it intends to be referring only to suicides since 2008. We asked several experts whether the meme's claim was even remotely possible. ""There is no basis for this claim,"" said Douglas Massey, a population-research professor at Princeton University. ""It isn't plausible that every suicide over a nine-year period could be attributed to foreclosure,"" agreed Janet M. Currie, a Princeton University economist who, along with Erdal Tekin of Georgia State University, has studied the health impacts of the rising tide of foreclosures in the United States. Tekin expressed similar skepticism when contacted by PolitiFact. In their own research, Currie and Tekin found that a location with about 400 foreclosures in a year might see 24 more medical visits for mental health conditions, including suicide attempts. But that wouldn’t be enough to support the meme’s claim, Currie said. Our ruling The meme said that over 300,000 homeowner suicides are attributable to foreclosures. But that would mean every suicide over a nine-year period would have been caused by a foreclosure, and experts say that’s not credible.

Mark Udall ad says Cory Gardner 'championed' Colorado fight to ban birth control
","Women, particularly single women, voted strongly for President Barack Obama and other Democrats in 2012. Hoping to replicate that success, Democrats this year are hammering Republicans on women’s health issues in the early stages of the 2014 midterm campaign season. A good example is Colorado, where Democratic Sen. Mark Udall is expected to face Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., in November. Udall recently released a 30-second ad attacking Gardner on abortion and birth control. ""Congressman Cory Gardner’s history promoting harsh anti-abortion laws is disturbing,"" the narrator says. ""Gardner sponsored a bill to make abortion a felony, including cases of rape and incest. Gardner even championed an eight-year crusade to outlaw birth control here in Colorado."" Udall’s campaign said Gardner’s ""crusade to outlaw birth control"" stems from his support of efforts to add so-called ""personhood"" language that would define life beginning at fertilization to the Colorado Constitution. Opponents of personhood legislation say that giving a fertilized egg all the rights of person could make illegal several FDA-approved contraceptives. (More on that in a bit.) Anti-abortion groups successfully petitioned to get personhood measures on the Colorado ballot in 2008 and 2010. Both times it was rejected by more than 70 percent of voters. In a further complication, Gardner recently made a major about-face, saying he no longer supports the personhood movement, partly because he now thinks it could potentially impact access to certain forms of birth control. ""The fact that it restricts contraception, it was not the right position,"" Gardner told The Denver Post. ""I've learned to listen. I don't get everything right the first time."" Despite this, Gardner’s camp still contends Udall’s ad is misleading because Gardner thought he was supporting an anti-abortion measure, not a referendum on birth control. Gardner’s campaign argues that it’s an exaggeration of his position to claim that he’s ""championed"" a ""crusade to outlaw birth control."" What are we to make of this? We can’t predict how the courts would interpret personhood legislation or its impact on legal birth control. Though even Gardner acknowledges that some contraceptives could be at risk if personhood passed, a lot of legal ambiguity remains. Because no state has passed a personhood measure, we don’t know how it could impact specific types of contraceptives. As we’ve noted in past articles about the debate over personhood, some legal scholars and the medical community have cautioned that it could potentially impact access to birth control. In a 2011 op-ed to the New York Times, Glenn Cohen, co-director of the Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics at Harvard University, and Jonathan Will, law professor at Mississippi College, said what is considered ""fertilization"" is not even clear. Fertilization could mean at least four different things: ""penetration of the egg by a sperm,"" successful combination of the genetic information from sperm and egg, activation of the genetic information, and ""implantation of the embryo in the uterus,"" Cohen and Will wrote. Sperm penetration occurs almost immediately, but implantation can take up to two weeks. ""Thus, on some reasonable readings of the amendment, certain forms of birth control ... would seem impermissible, while on other equally reasonable readings they are not."" Therefore, it is difficult to know how courts would react, especially considering that past rulings have affirmed the right of access to birth control. A personhood law could present proponents an opportunity to challenge those rulings. So we’re left trying to determine whether Gardner’s past positions in support of personhood could reasonably be considered as championing a crusade against birth control. Gardner’s history In 2006, Colorado Right to Life asked all politicians running for office if they supported the Right to Life Act in Congress, ""recognizing that personhood begins at fertilization."" Gardner, then a first-term state representative answered yes. Udall’s campaign provided a television news story from March 17, 2008, that appears to briefly show Gardner in a room with several Republican colleagues signing on to the petition to put personhood on the Colorado ballot (around the 1-minute mark). Gardner’s campaign did not respond to questions about his support of the 2008 referendum. His campaign did, however, acknowledge that Gardner supported the referendum efforts in 2010 at a candidate forum. In a video clip from the forum, Gardner says he signed the petition and circulated it at his church. He also said the measure ""backs up my support for life,"" but did not mention contraceptives or birth control. News stories from Colorado papers in 2008 and 2010 mention the debate over contraceptives involved in personhood legislation. In fact, Ken Buck, the 2010 Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Colorado, backed away from his previous support of the personhood referendum because he said it could impact some forms of birth control. So contraception was a live issue at the time. But Cohen, the Harvard professor, told PolitiFact that ""it is unclear that the Colorado 2008 and 2010 referendums were intended to ‘outlaw birth control in Colorado’ — that's what the word ‘crusade’ seems to imply. It is more clear that the language of those amendments might have outlawed some forms of birth control, whether that was the goal or not."" In other words, Gardner may have been in favor of the amendment, but for reasons other than curbing contraception. Since getting elected to Congress in 2010, Gardner has co-sponsored the Life Begins at Conception Act in 2012 and 2013, which has been described as federal personhood legislation. But he was hardly alone in doing so, nor was he an early backer. In 2012, he was one of the final cosponsors of 120 lawmakers, joining a full 14 months after the bill was introduced. In 2013, the bill had 128 sponsors, with Gardner signing on four months after introduction. Gardner’s campaign notes that in 2007, he was one of five to cosponsor an anti-abortion measure in Colorado that specified that ""nothing in this section shall prohibit the sale, use, prescription or administration of a contraceptive measure, device, drug or chemical."" This bill, his campaign said, demonstrates that while Gardner is pro-life, he is not anti-contraceptive. Udall’s campaign, though, noted Gardner also voted against the ""Birth Control Protection Act"" in 2009, a response to the 2008 personhood ballot referendum, which became law. Our ruling Udall’s ad said Gardner ""championed an eight-year crusade to outlaw birth control here in Colorado."" It’s clear Gardner has supported personhood in the past, and it’s hard for him to claim ignorance about the measure’s threat to contraception, given the media attention that aspect of the law attracted at the time. Gardner also voted against a bill that would have legally protected birth control. Still, the effort is probably more accurately described as a crusade against abortion than against birth control, and ""championed"" is also a strong word to describe Gardner’s role, since it implies that he was a leader in the cause. Udall’s ad is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/apr/25/mark-udall/mark-udall-says-cory-gardner-championed-colorado-f/

Lead bullets will have to come from overseas after EPA closed smelter, chain email says
","""We, the American public have been blindsided again by the Obama crowd!!!"" warns a chain email. ""Last Lead smelting plant -- gone."" The email goes on to blame the ""Evil Protection Agency"" for shutting down a lead smelting plant, calling it ""backdoor gun control"" and saying it will result in the cost of bullets soaring. ""All lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!"" the email says, adding, ""Long term what this means: Your investment in ammo may be your best investment. Guns will be plentiful but ammo will be another story. How does $3.75 a round (that's for one bullet) for a 9mm work for you?  Box of 50 would only cost you $187.50."" We wondered: Is the email correct to say that all lead for bullets will now have to come from overseas? The Doe Run plant We’ve been down this road before. In December, former Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West of South Florida, stated on his website: ""It seems that back door gun control is in full effect in the United States. Why? Thanks to Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we can no longer smelt lead from ore in the United States. ... So America, back door gun control is moving forward and while we are all distracted with Obamacare and Iran nuclear negotiations, our Second Amendment rights are undergoing an assault by clandestine infiltration."" We rated West’s claim Pants on Fire. The shuttered smelter, operated by Doe Run, is located in Herculaneum, Mo. Facing regulatory concerns about its air-quality record, Doe Run announced in 2010 that it had reached a settlement with the EPA and the state of Missouri which included paying fines. Then, in December 2013, it shut down. We found no evidence that the EPA’s settlement had anything to do with gun control -- it was about pollution. Ever since the EPA was created in 1970, one of its missions has been to limit pollution from smelters, which are ""terribly toxic sites,"" said David Rosner, a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University who studies the politics of pollution, told us when we wrote fact-checked West. Lead can accumulate in the body from many sources, and it can severely hamper mental and physical development. ""It had nothing to do with gun control or bullets,"" Rosner told PolitiFact. ""The idea of linking this to an issue of gun control or a surreptitious way for the government trying to shut down the gun industry is nuts. This was an EPA decision because of children who were being poisoned by what had come out of that plant."" Indeed, while the chain email blames Obama, the EPA’s case against Doe Run actually began decades ago. The St. Louis area failed to meet federal clean air standards for lead in 1987 due to emissions from the smelter, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in 1989. That was during the Reagan administration. Reagan wasn't the only Republican president who presided over an advance in the national anti-lead effort. In 2008, during the tenure of President George W. Bush, the EPA adopted tougher air quality standards for lead that were 10 times more stringent than the past. Doe Run’s primary smelter -- a plant that extracts lead from ore -- was the last primary smelter in the country. But Doe Run continues to operate as a secondary lead smelter -- essentially a recycler for lead contained in other products. That includes -- you guessed it -- bullets. A company spokeswoman told us in December that more than 80 percent of all lead produced in the United States is used in either vehicle batteries or in stationary batteries for backup power used by the military and in telecommunications and medical applications. ""In the U.S., the recycle rate of these batteries is approximately 98 percent, making lead-based batteries the most highly recycled consumer product,"" the company said in a statement. ""These batteries are recycled at secondary lead smelters. We own such a smelter in southern Missouri."" In our previous fact check, Doe Run spokeswoman Tammy Stankey told us that the company ""will continue to supply our ammo customers using secondary lead."" We contacted Stankey again for this fact-check. ""The primary smelter did close, (but) we are still supplying ammo customers through our only secondary smelter,"" she told us. ""We do know that primary lead is being imported to the U.S., but we don’t know if it is specific to ammunition suppliers. ... There are many other uses of lead."" Ammunition experts Now that the Doe Run primary smelter has been shuttered for a few months, we checked back with ammunition experts to see whether there’s any evidence that all lead for bullets now comes from overseas. An NRA spokesman referred us to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Spokesman Mike Bazinet told us for this fact-check that ""almost all the lead used in ammunition in the U.S. comes from secondary sources, recycled car batteries and other sources of lead. The closing of the lead smelter has not had any effect on ammunition prices or availability. ... Lead for bullets comes from secondary sources, and that was not completely understood by people out there. We certainly tried explain that it's had virtually no effect on ammunition prices."" While some ammunition is imported to the U.S. from overseas, ""it would be pretty heavy stuff to send (lead) across the ocean and put into a bullet. There are secondary sources of lead in sufficient quantity in the United States."" Tom Falone -- president of Clearwater-based Florida Bullet, which supplies ammunition to law-enforcement agencies in Florida -- said its manufacturer has been using reclaimed lead for years. ""I think that by the time we see a shortage, the industry will have found another material to replace the lead with,"" Falone said. Our ruling A chain email said that following closure of a lead smelter in Missouri, ""all lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!"" While the closure of a Doe Run primary lead smelter in December 2013 means there are no smelters to make lead from ore anywhere in the United States, smelters to recycle lead remain in operation, and their output is substantial enough to satisfy the needs of ammunition manufacturers. Four months after that particular smelter closed, we found no evidence that all lead for bullets now comes from overseas.

MSNBC labels Fla. Republican as Charlie Crist adviser, wrongly claims Crist bashed Democrat Bill Nelson
","The national media is abuzz, again, about the possibility of Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., shaking up the Florida governor’s race. Nelson has repeatedly said he has no plans to enter, but he hasn’t flatly ruled out a scenario in which he enters the race if Democratic front-runner Charlie Crist appears to flame out against Republican incumbent Gov. Rick Scott. A new poll has Crist and Scott tied with 42 percent of the vote, while other polls generally have shown Crist ahead. On Wednesday at a luncheon with Daytona Beach business leaders, Nelson zinged Scott for rejecting high-speed rail financed by federal stimulus dollars and not pushing harder for billions of federal dollars to expand Medicaid to poor, uninsured residents. ""I think it’s not only a shame,"" Nelson said, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. ""I think it’s a moral abscess."" The speech generated headlines that Nelson was toying with the idea of running. That, in turn, spawned reaction from Scott’s campaign chairman, state Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine.

PolitiFact: Sex trafficking plagues Atlanta, but Carter overreaches in ranking city No. 1
","The topics of sex slavery and human trafficking have gotten plenty of ink lately. Only last month, a study commissioned by the Justice Department showed Atlanta topping a handful of cities -- including Miami and Washington -- in the lucrative sex-trade industry, with projected annual earnings approaching $300 million. Former President Jimmy Carter weighs in on the subject in his 28th and newest book, ""A Call to Action: Women, Religion, Violence and Power."" Carter is considered one of America’s most prolific writers among former presidents, only topped in most book counts by Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover. His book focuses on the abuse of women, which he calls ""the worst and most pervasive and unaddressed human rights violations on earth."" On radio recently to promote the book, the former president said, ""Atlanta is the No. 1 trading point for sexual slavery in America."" ""Between 100 and 200 girls are sold into slavery in Atlanta every month,"" Carter told Scott Slade on News 95.5/AM 750 WSB on April 6. Numbers like those given by Carter are jolting to people who can’t relate to this dark and complex world where seller, buyer and, oftentimes, victim operate in secrecy. But how these numbers are gleaned merits further examination. Human trafficking, sometimes referred to as modern-day slavery, comes, according to the United States Trafficking Victims Protection Act, largely in two forms: commercial sex and work servitude. The victims of each comply most often through force, fraud or coercion. Sex involving a child under 18 also is classified as human trafficking. Steven Hochman, Carter’s assistant and the director of research at the Carter Center, said the numbers that Carter quoted in the interview with Slade -- 100 to 200 girls sold into slavery every month in Atlanta -- were ""conservative."" In his book (Page 127), Carter puts the number at between 200 and 300 girls a month. The former president obtained the estimates he used in his book from a presenter at the Carter Center’s Human Rights Defenders’ Forum, Hochman said. The presenter drew from studies released by The Schapiro Group in Atlanta from 2007 to 2011. Those studies estimated that 200 to 400 girls were being sexually exploited each month in Georgia. The Schapiro Group did research on the Internet, on the streets, in hotels and about escort services in an attempt to get a head count of underage girls being sexually exploited commercially. Similar estimates have been used by state agencies, including the Georgia Department of Education, which hosted a two-day conference last year for educators on how to spot and combat human trafficking. More studies are expected on the issue, including one by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The results of the GBI study should be out in May and will include numbers lower than those reported in The Schapiro Group study, GBI spokeswoman Sherry Lang said. GBI officials have questioned the methodology of The Schapiro Group report, which company President Beth Schapiro stands by and says produced ""very conservative numbers."" ""We are the first to say this is not perfect ... that our numbers are not complete,"" she said. ""But it is a great starting point. And we are ready for more folks to jump in."" Alan Seelinger, the state advocacy leader for the nonprofit International Justice Mission, said Carter’s numbers appear on target, based not only on The Schapiro Group study, but also on other tracking that’s taken place. As to Carter’s other statement that Atlanta is the No. 1 trading point for sexual slavery in America, Hochman said the former president was drawing from media reports on the recently released study that was commissioned by the Justice Department and done by the Urban Institute. The four media reports Hochman referenced, including a blog post by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, could be misleading or confusing. They referenced Atlanta as ""the capital,"" ""the nation’s major hub"" or the ""No. 1"" city for sex trade. But two of the reports, including the AJC blog, also noted the limited scope of the study. The Urban Institute report focused on eight cities -- Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, Mo., Miami, San Diego, Seattle and Washington. Larger municipalities, such as Chicago, Los Angeles and New York were not included. The study showed that in 2007 the underground sex trade in Atlanta brought in $290 million, the largest amount for seven of the studied cities. (No estimate was made for Kansas City.) But No. 1 in America? One of the study’s authors says that statement wasn’t proven. ""We don’t have the data to say which U.S. city brings in the most money nationwide,"" Meredith Dank told PolitiFact Georgia. Our conclusion: Sex trafficking is clearly a sizable and troubling problem in Georgia and elsewhere. As early as 2005, the FBI identified Atlanta as one of 14 cities where its offices reported having the highest incidence of children used in prostitution. But by its very nature, sex trafficking is hard to track, even estimate. That’s likely true whether you’re trying to size up the profits or gauging how many girls are involved. Carter’s estimate on the number of girls aligns with -- and is on the conservative side of -- other estimates that are out there. His statement about the lucrative nature of the business in Atlanta draws on recent research that found that in 2007 the sex trade generated $290 million in Atlanta -- the highest amount among seven of the eight cities that were studied. But his statement needed context so his audiences understand that it was drawn from a study that was limited in scope. His spokesman rightly points out that the media reports he relied upon, with only a cursory reading, support the label of No. 1 in the nation. You could look deeper into two of those accounts or read the report itself though, and see that it was an overreach. Both the media outlets and the former president could have done a better job.   Part of Carter’s statement accurately quotes the estimates that are out there on the girls involved. The part about Atlanta being ""the No. 1 trading point for sexual slavery in America"" is off base. Overall, we rate Carter’s two-part statement Half True.",/factchecks/2014/apr/25/jimmy-carter/politifact-sex-trafficking-plagues-atlanta-carter-/

Did Sen. Harry Reid drive the standoff at the Bundy ranch for personal gain?
","The furor over Cliven Bundy’s cows in Nevada has churned up some powerful speculation about the murky forces at play. A long-running effort by the federal Bureau of Land Management to stop Bundy from letting his cattle forage without paying any grazing fees (on land that was off-limits to grazing in any event) turned into a standoff between federal agents and Bundy’s supporters, both well armed. Out of that drama came the assertion that Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid was behind it all and the goal was personal gain. Reid publicly endorsed federal action against Bundy. A tea party website Republic Broadcasting Network out of Texas put it succinctly. ""It’s very simple. Harry Reid, senator from Nevada, is using federal violence to take people’s land in his state so he can package it to re-sell it to the Chinese. That’s what the Bundy Ranch deal is all about."" This claim and its cousins have been debunked before (a tip of the hat to Snopes). Here’s the gist of its flaws: The government had no interest in Bundy’s property. It wanted his cattle off government land. Reid’s son had represented a Chinese firm that had been interested in developing a solar energy array, but the deal involved land far from the Bundy property and collapsed a year ago. The Bureau of Land Management has identified a desert area for solar power development, but it is about 50 miles away from both the Bundy ranch and the federal land where he likes to graze his cattle. The habitat protections on the land Bundy wants to use were put in place in 1994, long before there was any hint of Chinese interest. Reid's accusers posted an interview with Fabian Calvo, a Los Angeles real estate agent, as evidence to back up their inaccurate claim. Calvo connected the dots between Reid, his son Rory and the Bureau of Land Management. ""Reid’s son is involved with BLM customers, putting together deals right where Clive Bundy’s ranch is,"" Calvo said. ""The federal government is ready to send armed guards in to take peoples land, unconstitutionally, illegally, over what I believe is making sweetheart deals to the Chinese."" An editorial in Investors Business Daily hinted darkly that on March 14, the BLM announced support for the Western Solar Energy Plan. ""Coincidentally, part of that solar energy expansion includes a plan by China's ENN Energy Group to build what would be America's largest solar energy complex,"" the editorial said. ""The site chosen with the guidance of Reid's son, Rory, is in Laughlin, Nev. Laughlin is in Clark County, where Bundy's ranch is."" Clark County covers more than 8,000 square miles. Laughlin is about 100 miles as the crow flies from Bundy’s ranch. As for the ENN Energy Group, there had been a plan to turn 9,000 acres into the nation’s largest solar array. According to press reports, Reid’s son Rory did represent the company, and Reid himself helped recruit the company during a trip to China in 2011. But the deal hinged on nailing down long-term contracts to sell the power the massive facility would generate. When the developers were unable to get those agreements, they backed out. That was in July 2013. Looking at the BLM’s efforts to use federal lands as sites for solar energy, the agency released a list of 17 designated areas in 2012. The Dry Lake Solar Energy Zone is closest to Bundy’s ranch, but that doesn’t make it his neighbor. It is about 5,700 acres large but its closest border is at least 50 miles to the west of Bundy’s property. The BLM did invite energy companies to submit proposals in mid March. This was the final step in a two-year process aimed at managing the environmental impacts of any development that might take place in these zones. That environmental assessment provides one possible link to Bundy and his cows. In order to offset the loss of natural habitat in the development zone, the government typically preserves or restores the same kind of habitat someplace else. The Dry Lake area is home to the desert tortoise, a threatened species. Mike Connor is with the Western Watersheds Project, an environmental conservation group. Connor said Nevada has four areas designated as Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) to protect the desert tortoise. One of those is Gold Butte. That’s the federal land where Bundy has been grazing his cattle. Some of Bundy’s defenders have said that blocking him from Gold Butte would make it easier to build at Dry Lake. ""That really wouldn’t make any sense,"" Connor said. ""Gold Butte was set aside as an ACEC in 1994. You can’t use the same land twice to protect the same habitat. There really is no connection between what’s going on at Dry Lake and what’s going on at Gold Butte."" Our ruling The Republic Broadcasting Network said Sen. Reid was behind the use of force to take away Bundy’s land and sell it to the Chinese. There is nothing accurate about this claim. The dispute involved Bundy’s long use of federal land without a permit. The land gained protected status long before solar energy projects were on the table. The Chinese solar energy proposal no longer exists. The land where such projects might be developed are far from Bundy’s property.

Rachel Maddow unleashes on Oklahoma's 'sun tax' but misses context
","Rachel Maddow sharply criticized Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin on her MSNBC show Monday for imposing a ""sun tax"" on residents who install solar panels or wind turbines to conserve energy and save on their electric bill. But Maddow’s searing attack is misleading, says even a solar energy trade association. Maddow topped her April 21 broadcast with the story of SB 1456, connecting the ""sun tax"" law to conservative-driven efforts in other states to dial back state-approved benefits for utility customers who use alternative energy sources like small wind turbines and solar panels. (In Oklahoma, wind turbines are more prevalent than solar panels, for the record.) ""Tonight Oklahoma’s Republican Gov. Mary Fallin signed a new law which makes you pay a special fee,"" she said. ""It will essentially fine people for the crime of using solar power. If you want to use the sun for electricity instead of your local coal fire power plant, the redder-than-red state Oklahoma government has figured out a way to make you pay for that crime."" But the law mandates no special fee or fine as Maddow says. What SB 1456 does is crack open the door for Oklahoma’s utility companies to apply to charge future ""distributed generation"" customers (the ones who invest in solar and wind energy devices on their properties) a tariff, surcharge, fee, or whatever you want to call it. But that fee or ""fine"" could only come after extensive court-like hearings before a state regulator, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. And there are questions if that will happen. In signing the proposal into law, Fallin released an executive order that repeatedly stressed the bill does not mean a fee or surcharge is the only way to deal with the concern of utility companies. Fallin ""specifically said the bill does not mandate an increase for solar customers,"" said Bryan Miller, president of the pro-solar group Alliance for Solar Choice. While Miller opposes a fee or surcharge should one come, he said Maddow’s segment missed the mark. Miller called Fallin’s executive order ""a tremendously positive step for the future of Oklahoma in promoting distributed generation."" ""Even without the executive order, it was a very misleading story,"" Miller said. MSNBC spokeswoman Lauren Skowronski said the show stood by its reporting. ""The order declares the governor’s recognition that renewable energy is important, but it does not, in any codified way, meaningfully change what the new law does,"" Skowronski said. ""The law was opposed by advocates of solar power for the very reason that it is designed to impede the expansion of solar usage among Oklahoma consumers, and the governor’s executive order does not change that."" We’ll unpack all of this a little more for you.    Oklahoma’s explanation SB 1456 moved quickly through the Republican-led Oklahoma Legislature. State Rep. Mike Turner, a Republican whom Maddow mocked during her April 21 show for proposing an all-out ban on marriage, was the primary House sponsor of the bill. He introduced it on the Oklahoma House floor this way: ""Members, this bill effectively allows our senior citizens as well as our lower-income individuals in this state to no longer bear the cost of the way that we do accounting."" That’s not a very detailed or transparent explanation for what SB 1456 is really about, but no one asked questions before passing it on an 83-5 vote. (One lawmaker asked Turner a question privately as members voted, and Turner could be heard saying, ""This doesn’t raise, it’s not what people think."") Turner told PunditFact he was not acting at the behest of utilities, the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council or Koch brothers by supporting the Senate bill, as Maddow suggested during her broadcast. Still, a pro-solar Republican group went against him for sponsoring the bill in a video ad suggesting he turned on conservative principles by ""taxing solar."" ""It’s not a tax,"" Turner told PunditFact of his bill. ""You have to be a willing customer."" A self-described opponent of subsidies, Turner says Oklahoma’s 350 or so customers who use wind, solar or other alternative energy devices are being subsidized by other utility customers under current law. Here’s his argument. Most people who have wind- and solar- energy devices are not completely off the grid. They access the grid on cloudy or low-wind days, utilities say. Like most states, Oklahoma has a net-metering law that allows ratepayers who install solar panels and microturbines to sell excess energy they generate for use by their nearest neighbor. The utility, compelled by federal law, must buy back this energy at the retail rate, so the ""seller"" is charged only for their net energy use (what they sell minus what they use). Before Turner’s bill became law, utility companies could not charge solar customers for extracting the excess energy with their infrastructure. Turner says solar panel customers fail to compensate the utility companies for harnessing the extra power. As a result, that additional cost is picked up by other customers. Spokespeople for the state’s two largest utility companies, Oklahoma Gas and Electric and the Public Service Company of Oklahoma, say the current system is giving an unfair break on grid ""maintenance costs"" to customers who use solar or wind power. ""What we credit them for energy they generate greatly exceeds the value of that energy,"" said Stan Whitehouse, Public Service Company of Oklahoma spokesman. ""Distributed generation is no longer in its infancy, and as potential for growth grows, the subsidization will only increase."" This bill could fix that inequity, the utilities say, by letting the state utility regulator ""set up a new rate for distributed generation that would be very clear about here is what you owe to cover the cost of the grid maintenance and here is the amount of electricity you use,"" said Oklahoma Gas and Electric spokeswoman Kathleen O’Shea. Practically speaking, the fee would eat into the credits solar and wind customers accumulate from selling excess energy back to the electrical grid -- a concept that pro-solar groups, including Miller’s Alliance for Solar Choice, oppose. To Maddow, that’s a tax. To Turner, it’s eliminating a subsidy. The law, which goes into effect Nov. 1, says utilities would have to get new charges approved by the end of 2015. What SB 1456 does Specifically, the law modifies a 1970s-era law that prevented utilities from increasing rates or imposing a surcharge because a consumer installed a solar energy device. The change would not affect existing customers. The law says a higher fixed charge for new customers with energy-saving equipment is ""a means to avoid subsidization."" Emphasis on ""a,"" Miller said. ""It says you can have a fee, but it doesn’t say you have to have a fee,"" he said. The practical effect of the bill for future solar and wind customers is unclear until the state’s utility regulator starts the process of reviewing a fee request from a utility. Arguments for and against would be reviewed by an administrative law judge, who would make a recommendation to Oklahoma’s three-person Corporation Commission. The commission could approve the fee or surcharge, reject it, or order additional review. To approve the fee -- and this is important -- the Corporation Commission would need to conclude solar and wind customers are being subsidized by other energy users. Alternative energy users would still save money by selling their excess energy, they’d just save less. The law does not just affect solar users. Mike Bergey, Bergey WindPower Co. president and CEO, sent a letter to Fallin expressing profound disappointment for signing the law because uncertainty about a fee will hurt microturbine sales by dissuading customers interested in investing in a nascent industry. Oklahoma does not offer state incentives for residents who install small-scale solar and wind devices, so ""it’s a rare customer"" who is willing to take the investment leap. A federal tax credit defrays some of the cost of a small $65,000 wind system, but extra utility fees would extend the payback period that customers usually recoup from reduced bills. ""Certainly the utilities will make a strong case for additional charges,"" said Bergey, who said he will fight a proposed utility tariff. ""What the industry is concerned about is they’ll play up the cost ... and ignore the benefits."" Some observers look to what happened in Arizona as a sign of what could come next. There, a utility proposal backed by conservative groups to charge solar customers $50-$100 per month was whittled down to about $5 by the commission. And that executive order?  Fallin’s executive order insisted the bill ""does not mandate tariffs or other increases for distributed generation customers."" Fallin told state agencies to implement the bill in accordance with her energy plan, ""which promotes wind and solar power as important forms of clean energy,"" and for the commission to ""consider the use of all available alternatives, including other rate reforms such as increased use of time-of-use rates, minimum bills, and demand charges."" The executive order isn’t binding, but it provides guidance to the Corporation Commission. Commissioners are elected statewide while vacancies are filled by the governor. ""This will be given all the attention that any changes in rates are given,"" said Mike Skinner, the Corporation Commission spokesman. Still, Fallin’s order is music to solar advocates’ ears. ""Even without the executive order, the bill is just ambiguous and does not mandate any charge,"" Miller said. ""But the executive order lends a lot of clarity to that."" We checked in with TUSK, or Tell Utilities Solar won’t be Killed, a pro-solar group led by Republicans Barry Goldwater Jr., a former California congressman, and Tom Morrissey, former chairman of the Arizona Republican Party. TUSK consultant Jason Rose called Fallin’s executive order indicative of ""Republican adults"" who support customers’ rights to use solar to defray electric costs. ""Do I think (Maddow’s) assessment of the legislative effort was accurate? Yes, I do,"" Rose said. ""Was she unaware, or were her producers unaware, of the executive order that neutered the legislation? Yes."" Our ruling Maddow said, ""Oklahoma's Republican Gov. Mary Fallin signed a new law which makes you pay a special fee. It will essentially fine people for the crime of using solar power."" The law does not make you pay a special fee for using solar power, as Maddow said. What it does do is open the door to a potential fee -- if utility companies can prove that solar and wind customers are being subsidized by other energy consumers. We’re a ways from knowing whether the utilities can make their case and what fee might be assessed. The law does not affect the ability of Oklahoma solar and wind customers to sell excess energy they produce to lower their monthly bill, and even advocates of solar energy say Maddow’s segment missed news in Fallin’s executive order, which stressed ""this bill does not mandate tariffs or other increases"" for people who generate alternative energy.

Chain email says Barack Obama wants U.S. to join International Criminal Court
","A reader recently sent us an email that had a meandering -- but strongly critical -- message of opposition to President Barack Obama. The email, which can be read in its entirety here, urges veterans and their families to vote in the 2014 midterm elections in order to send Obama a message. Here are excerpts: ""The President, the Commander in Chief, has made the Rules of Engagement (ROE) so difficult, that our troops are often killed before they can even get permission to fight. Nothing has been done to stop our troops from being murdered by the Afghanis they are training, either. ""Now, the President wants the US to sign on to the UNs International Criminal Court (ICC), which would allow the UN's ICC to arrest and try US troops for War Crimes, without the legal protections guaranteed under US Law, and from which there is no appeal. The President, with his Democratic control of the Senate, has nearly all the power. If the Non-Establishment Republicans, and Conservatives, can take back the Senate in 2014, our troops can once again be protected from unnecessary danger. Please consider this, and send it on to your mailing lists."" We will be checking a few claims from this email, but in this report, we’ll look at the claim that ""the President wants the U.S. to sign on to the U.N.’s International Criminal Court."" First, some background on the International Criminal Court and its relationship to the United States. The ICC is a permanent, independent court headquartered in the Hague that investigates and brings to justice individuals who commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, according to the Congressional Research Service. Cases may be referred to the ICC either by a member state, the court’s own prosecutor, or the U.N. Security Council. The court only investigates or prosecutes serious crimes by individuals (not organizations or governments), and then, only when national judicial systems are unwilling or unable to handle them. The court’s founding document, known as the Rome Statute, entered into force on July 1, 2002. So far, 122 nations have become members of the court. But while the United States signed the Rome Statute under President Bill Clinton in 2000, it has not moved on to ratification -- the step that would make membership official. This position is intentional. Under President George W. Bush, the United States actually went so far as to ""un-sign"" the Rome Statute. The reasons included concerns that the court could exercise jurisdiction over U.S. citizens or military officials, as well as a perceived lack of checks and balances on court pursuits. More recently, United States opposition has softened -- within limits. In 2008, the United States decided not to veto a Security Council resolution to refer a case from the Darfur region of Sudan. Then, when Obama took office, it began attending sessions as an ""observer"" nation in 2009. In January 2010, a Justice Department review found that ""informational"" support for ""particular investigations or prosecutions"" would be legal under laws passed under Bush. In theory, the Obama administration could choose to seek Senate ratification. But even if it did, experts say, the administration’s ability to win the 67 votes in the Senate is almost nonexistent, given the extent of lingering concern about U.S. membership in the court. ""President Obama has made no indication that he ‘wants the U.S. to sign on to the U.N.’s International Criminal Court,’"" said Steven Groves, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""Since everyone knows such a transmittal would be dead on arrival, the likelihood that the president would do so before the end of his term is negligible, if not zero."" Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor who specializes in international law, agrees, calling the email’s claim ""completely wrong."" ""Although the U.S. is no longer actively opposed to the court's existence and operation, as was the Bush administration, the Obama administration has no intention of submitting the ICC statute to the Senate,"" Ratner said. In other words, the email is wrong to claim that Obama, ""with his Democratic control of the Senate, has nearly all the power."" All Obama could theoretically do is ask for Senate support. Even if the Democrats had 67 votes -- which they don’t -- ratification for this particular agreement would be an uphill battle. We should add that the email has some other misleading elements about the court, such as when it says the court can ""arrest and try U.S. troops for War Crimes, without the legal protections guaranteed under U.S. Law, and from which there is no appeal."" While the ICC can issue ""arrest warrants,"" it cannot enforce them. The ICC ""cannot ‘arrest’ anyone -- it has no police power whatsoever,"" said Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service Anthony Clark Arend. Instead, it has to rely on its member states to do so, and ""a state would not want to cooperate with the ICC if it sought arrest based on trumped-up charges,"" Ratner said. Ratner added that, contrary to the email’s claim about weak legal protections, the ICC procedures are ""generally on par with U.S. law, with small exceptions such as trial by judges rather than a jury, and looser rules for admission of evidence."" Our ruling The chain email says Obama ""wants the U.S. to sign on to the U.N.’s International Criminal Court."" While the Obama administration has been more willing to engage with the court than the Bush administration, which was strongly opposed to cooperating, Obama has made no sign that he wants to become a full-blown member of the court. Even if he did, doing so would require 67 votes in the Senate, making it essentially a nonstarter. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2014/apr/24/chain-email/chain-email-says-barack-obama-wants-us-joint-inter/
"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Stimulus', 'Virginia', 'Robert Hurt']","
Robert Hurt says some federal spending is up over 80 percent in two years
","
U.S. Rep. Robert Hurt recently refashioned a threadbare GOP claim on the growth of federal spending under President Barack Obama.

Hurt, R-5th, wrote in a June 3 newsletter that non-defense discretionary spending has increased ""by over 80 percent in the last two years.""

Does the the Southside Virginia congressman have his facts right?  We thought we’d check.

First, a few definitions. Discretionary spending is the money Congress controls through annual appropriations. It goes for services such as defense, education, health and housing. In contrast, mandatory spending is used for entitlement programs with required levels of spending -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

About 60 percent of discretionary spending goes towards the U.S. defense budget. As the phrase suggests, ""non-defense discretionary spending"" removes military money from the pot. So Hurt is addressing a left over portion of the U.S. budget that accounts for about one-sixth of annual spending.

Amanda Henneberg, Hurt’s press secretary, said her boss’s statement was based on a Feb. 3 news release by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., the chairman of the House Budget Committee.

PolitiFact is no stranger to Ryan’s release. An assortment of Republicans -- including speaker Speaker Boehner of Ohio and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia -- have used Ryan’s numbers to exaggerate spending increases since Obama took office Jan. 20, 2009.

Ryan’s numbers show non-defense discretionary spending rose from $434 billion in fiscal 2008 to $537 billion in fiscal 2010. That’s a 23.7 percent jump. Then Ryan added $259 billion in stimulus money to the fiscal 2010 ledger, since that’s the amount of the roughly $862 billion stimulus outlay deemed discretionary by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.

If you compare the new 2010 total -- $796 billion -- to the original $434 billion, you get an 83.4 percent increase. It creates a convenient Republican chart that shows non-defense discretionary spending soaring up like a rocket from 2008 through 2010. If Ryan put the stimulus money in 2009, when it was approved, his chart would look like a roller coaster -- spending would have climbed steeply in 2009 and dropped in 2010.

Hurt’s newsletter did not mention that he was counting the stimulus money. And there’s a major problem with the congressman’s math.

The CBO counts all of the stimulus funds in the 2009 budget, since that’s the year the bill passed Congress. Hurt and other Republicans have chosen to move the stimulus money to its 2010 budget count.

The money actually is being spent over several years. The bulk of the spending came in 2009 and 2010, with increasingly smaller amounts being spent this year and in the next several years. The CBO says it cannot provide a breakdown of how much money is being spent each year.  

To get another look at how much the government has spent in each of the past several years, we turned to budget tables from the Office of Management and Budget. The OMB is the White House’s budget office. It tracks exactly how much was spent by each agency during the past several years, regardless of the source of the funding.

According to OMB tables, non-defense discretionary spending was $522.4 billion in fiscal 2008 and climbed to $658.2 billion in fiscal 2010. That is a 26 percent increase, roughly in line with the increase cited by Ryan.

But that spike includes money from the stimulus, said Meg Reilly, an OMB spokeswoman. It counts all non-defense discretionary money spent by the government during the given year.

Paul Krugman, a liberal economist who teaches at Princeton University and is a columnist for The New York Times, noted in a recent blog that the OMB projects non-defense discretionary spending to fall off rapidly in 2012 and 2013, as stimulus funds are exhausted. By 2013, the OMB estimates it will be back at 2009 levels, though that is still about 10 percent higher than 2008 spending, the last full budget year under former Republican President George W. Bush.

""So this GOP talking point is a complete fraud; it’s based on counting the same spending several times over,"" Krugman wrote.

Let’s review Hurt’s claim.

The Virginia Congressman said non-defense discretionary spending has climbed ""by over 80 percent in the last two years."" Unlike other Republicans who have made similar claims, he did not say that much of the increase came from the 2009 stimulus bill.

Republicans reach this number by putting all of the one-time discretionary stimulus money in the 2010 budget instead of 2009, when the stimulus was approved.

Moreover, data from the White House budget office provide strong evidence that the GOP has double-counted the stimulus.

The White House budget office shows non-defense discretionary spending rose 26 percent from 2008 to 2010. The CBO, which Hurt and other Republicans cite as their source, puts the increase at 23.7 percent.

That’s a long way from the ""over 80 percent""  increase claimed by Hurt. We rate his statement False. ",/factchecks/2011/jun/10/robert-hurt/robert-hurt-says-some-federal-spending-over-80-per/
"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Corporations', 'Herman Cain']","
Did Herman Cain turn around Godfather's Pizza?
","
Editor's note: This fact-check is a excerpt of a longer examination of Herman Cain's business accomplishments, including his work experience before and after Godfather's Pizza. Read the longer story here. 
Pizza is Herman Cain's biggest selling point. He says his track record running Godfather’s Pizza, a chain that once billed itself as ""the cure for the pizza emergency,"" shows he has the ability to run the country. The 620-store chain was on the brink of bankruptcy when he arrived in 1986, he says, and he ""turned it around with common-sense business principles."" 
A PolitiFact examination of Godfather’s, based on interviews with industry analysts and company officials, shows Cain is largely correct. The chain wasn’t literally preparing paperwork for bankruptcy, but it was widely considered troubled. Cain changed that by uniting the franchisees, overhauling the chain's advertising, and getting his team focused on its core mission: pizza. 
'They got what they paid for' 
Cain was an executive with The Pillsbury Co. when the company bought Godfather's in 1985. The purchase was almost incidental, according to press reports from the time. Godfather’s was part of Diversifoods Inc., a conglomerate that included more than 300 Burger King franchises. Pillsbury wanted the Burger Kings, and the chain of more than 800 Godfather’s pizza restaurants came with it. 
""The value of Diversifoods was its ownership of the Burger Kings, and the deal made sense without Godfather's,"" John McMillin, an industry analyst, told the Chicago Tribune shortly after the deal. ""Pillsbury got Godfather's for nothing, and some said they got what they paid for."" 
The chain’s problems included franchisee lawsuits, an overly long menu and a dejected workforce. Even its TV ads seemed hapless, showing a car full of executives driving around, unable to find a Godfather's. (""Find one. It's worth it,"" the ad lamely concluded.) As Cain said later, the chain had ""had one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel.""

Cain attacked problems on every front. He declared the company’s advertising account up for review, pitting ad agencies against each other in a bidding war. He trimmed the menu and enforced quality standards. He pushed more restaurants to offer delivery, and he closed low-performing franchises. 
He emphasized communication, giving speeches at important moments to employees and franchisees. After his first 60 days at Godfather's, he gave a speech he called ""get on the wagon,"" which he now uses in political speeches. 
When he was a boy, Cain said, his grandfather, a potato farmer, would hitch up his mules for the weekly trip to town. Any grandchildren who wanted to go could ride along. Cain would finish the story in his grandfather’s thundering voice: ""Them that’s going, get on the wagon! Them that ain’t, get out of the way!"" 
'Mesmerizing' 
Charles Henderson, who runs coffee kiosks in Pennsylvania, was Cain’s director of marketing back then. He says Cain is ""probably the most inspirational person I’ve ever met in my life."" 
""He can be mesmerizing. He’s very dynamic. I’m not slamming our current president, but Herman Cain will give a 20- or 30-minute speech extemporaneously, and certainly without teleprompters. He is without a doubt the most dynamic speaker I’ve ever heard,"" Henderson said. 
Henderson said Cain succeeded because he immersed himself in all aspects of the business and wasn’t afraid to get his hands into the dough. Cain baked pies on a weekly basis after he arrived in Omaha. ""He loved to make pizzas. We had a test store over on Pacific Street, which wasn’t too far from Godfather’s, and once a week, he’d round us all up and we’d go make pizzas,"" Henderson said. 
Cain directed an overhaul of the Godfather's television ads that focused on Godfather's ""hot slice,"" a customized pizza slice aimed at the lunch crowd and intended to compete with Pizza Hut's Personal Pan Pizza. The new ads showed a secretary at a desk about to have a ""pizza emergency."" Godfather's, of course, was the cure. 
Later commercials tended toward attention-getting and even bizarre humor. The ""Studney twins"" – an old white guy and a young black guy in garish blue and green tuxedos – promoted Godfather's two-for-one specials. Another ad featured attorney-turned-actor Ben Stein of  Ferris Bueller's Day Off as a burned-out hipster needing pizza. 
Cain himself even appeared in a series that Advertising Age named one of the best campaigns of 1989. In one ad, Cain told viewers Godfather's has conducted exhaustive research to find out why customers preferred Godfather's pizza. He introduced his director of research, who unveiled the results by unfolding a piece of paper and reading two words: ""More topping."" 
""Enjoy your Godfather's pizza, and take life one bite at a time,"" Cain concluded. 
'Steady the course' 
Jeff Campbell is the retired Pillsbury executive who selected Cain to run Godfather’s. Reached by PolitiFact at his home in San Diego, he said there was no doubt in his mind that Cain turned Godfather's around. 
""He was the best thing that happened to Godfather’s in a long time,"" Campbell said. 
Cain has said that the chain returned to profitability within 14 months of his arrival. That number wasn’t possible for PolitiFact to independently confirm because the chain did not report its profits as a stand-alone unit, but industry analysts do not dispute that Cain stabilized the company. 
Technomic, a research and consulting firm focused on the restaurant industry, has research data on Godfather’s going back to the 1970s. At PolitiFact’s request, vice president Darren Tristano examined the revenues and franchise numbers for Godfather’s during the time Cain headed it from 1986 to 1995. 
It's not possible to determine profitability from those numbers, but they do show Godfather's place in the market, particularly in comparison with its competitors. 
""It’s really hard from that period to find a strong positive or a strong negative. It’s more like ‘steady the course,’ "" Tristano said. 
Still, ""steady the course"" isn’t bad for a company that was troubled to start out with and in an industry that’s punishingly competitive, analysts said. 
Godfather’s position was particularly perilous. It wasn’t as big as chains like Pizza Hut and Domino’s, and it also had to compete with locally owned mom-and-pops in just about every market. 
""They had to be very innovative to compete with the big three and with the little guys. They couldn’t rest on their laurels,"" said John Correll, a Michigan-based pizza industry consultant. ""For a number of years, Herman Cain and his management team were able to pull that off."" 
Pizza Hut, the industry leader at the time, was a particularly difficult foe. After Godfather's launched its ""pizza emergency"" campaign in 1986, Pizza Hut matched it with ads imitating the emergency broadcast system. In the event of a real pizza emergency, ""you should go directly to Pizza Hut and order their famous pan pizza,"" the ad said. Pizza Hut executives said the similarity was coincidence. 
Cain said the alleged thievery wouldn’t matter in the end, and he wouldn’t pursue legal action. ""It's not a big deal to us,"" Cain told AdWeek, which documented the feud. 
Godfather’s never grew fast enough to outpace giants like Pizza Hut and Domino’s, but today it still claims about 620 franchises across the country. 
John Chisholm was a Godfather's franchisee who owned 90 restaurants in five states when Cain arrived to run the company. 
""His leadership and his ability to deal with people were just outstanding. I have nothing but the highest praise for Herman Cain,"" Chisholm said. 
Cain's primary accomplishment was motivating the people who worked for Godfather's, Chisolm said. The turn-around happened ""mostly through motivation and talking to people and getting people to work as a team."" 
Chisholm recalled Cain's first speech to the entire company as one of the ""most charismatic"" he ever heard. 
Cain included a copy of the speech in his 1999 book, Speak as a Leader. 
""Sixty days ago I came to Godfather's with a curiosity about what I would find. I had already accepted my newly bestowed responsibilities even before I stepped foot on Nebraska soil and before I met or knew anyone or anything about Godfather's. … Sixty days ago, I came to Godfather's anxious to tackle a situation considered by some of our external constituencies to be irreversible. I came without a golden parachute because I never entertained the idea that the situation was irreversible. I came committed to prove the skeptics wrong because I have a personal, fundamental belief in the power of human determination. I came to Godfather's believing in you even before I met you. I challenge you to commit and believe in yourself and Godfather's pizza as a system."" 
Two years after Cain was named chief executive officer, Pillsbury decided to get out of the pizza business and sell Godfather’s. Cain and his management team decided to buy the chain in a leveraged buyout for an undisclosed sum. Cain left the position in 1996 when he went to work for the National Restaurant Association. 
Cain now says of his time at the pizza chain, ""When I became president and CEO of Godfather’s Pizza, it was supposed to go bankrupt . . . We turned it around with common sense business principles."" 
Our ruling 
A thorough review of business records and interviews with executives who worked with Cain show that the chain was widely considered troubled when he arrived. It's a slight exaggeration to say it was supposed to go bankrupt. But from all accounts, Cain's performance as CEO is widely considered a success. So we rate this statement Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2011/jun/10/herman-cain/herman-cain-godfathers-pizza-turn-around/
"['Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Wisconsin', 'Sandy Pasch']","
Democratic Wisconsin state Rep. Sandy Pasch says GOP U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget plan would end health care for seniors
","
When some Democrats look at the federal budget plan proposed by House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., it’s as if they’ve caught sight of a tiki bar at the end of a hot summer day.

They aren’t envisioning fruity drinks with tiny umbrellas, but rather electoral victories. The Democrats see Ryan’s plan, particularly its changes to Medicare, as distasteful to voters and therefore an advantage for their party.

As evidence, they point to Democrat Kathy Hochul’s upset win in a western New York congressional race that was dominated by Ryan’s Medicare plan. That special election was held May 24, 2011, less than two months after Ryan released his plan, which would convert Medicare into a ""premium-support payment"" program starting in 2022.  

On June 6, 2011, Wisconsin state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, was asked in an online chat how Ryan would affect elections on another level.

Pasch is running in a recall election against state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, who aims to retain a seat she has held since 1992. It is one of an unprecedented nine state senator recall elections that will be held in Wisconsin in July 2011.

In the chat, which was sponsored by Blue America, a political action committee that says it works to elect progressives, a questioner asked:

""I just read that (Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman) Mike Tate says that Paul Ryan will be a central focus in the recall elections. I hadn't heard that before. Will it work? Is it that connected in people's minds? Or is it too abstract for the average voter to make the connection?""

Pasch, a second-term lawmaker who formerly worked as a nurse and nursing professor for 30 years, gave this response:

""I think that Paul Ryan is the face of the radical plan to dismantle Medicare and Medicaid. People across Wisconsin depend on and like Medicare. If you stand with Paul Ryan, you stand with the promise to end health care for our seniors. It's not just a policy issue, it's a values issue.""

So, according to Pasch, Ryan promised to end health care for senior citizens.

No health care? That would be one stiff drink to swallow.

Before we assess Pasch’s defense of her claim, a little background.

Ryan’s budget -- passed by the GOP-controlled House, 235-193, but defeated in the Democrat-controlled Senate, 57-40 -- would make dramatic changes to Medicare if it ever became law.

As it exists now, Medicare is government health insurance for people age 65 and over and for people under 65 with certain disabilities. It helps pay for doctor visits, inpatient and outpatient hospital care, other services and prescription drugs.

Under Ryan’s plan, people who turn 65 before 2022 would remain in traditional Medicare, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Those who turn 65 in 2022 or after, the budget office said, would get a ""premium support payment"" from Medicare. Rather than getting health insurance from the government, Medicare recipients would use the payment toward the cost of buying private health insurance.

That’s a major change. Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office concluded that future Medicare recipients ""would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system.""

But when MoveOn.org declared that Ryan’s budget ""abolishes Medicare within 10 years,"" the left-leaning political advocacy group earned a False from us, given that Medicare would change but not go away.

Other critics, including U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, haven’t gone as far, arguing instead that Ryan’s plan would end Medicare ""as we know it."" But when Wasserman Schultz also claimed that under Ryan’s Medicare, insurance companies could ""deny you coverage and drop you for pre-existing conditions,"" she got a False from our colleagues at PolitiFact National.

Yet Pasch goes even further, claiming Ryan has promised to ""end health care for our seniors."" Not just Medicare, but ""health care.""

Now to Pasch’s defense.

Pasch’s campaign manager, Phil Walzak, argued in an email to us that, under Ryan’s proposal, Medicare recipients would ""lose a guaranteed set of health benefits"" because they would instead receive money to be used toward buying private health insurance. He also predicted that Medicare recipients would get fewer benefits even though they would be paying more for their health care. He cited analyses by the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the National Academy of Social Insurance.

For her part, Pasch herself was more measured in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin than she was in the online chat, saying Ryan’s plan ""is clearly a move toward not promising health care to seniors."" She went on to say that as senior citizens are forced to pay more for health insurance, they will ""start neglecting their health care.""

It’s time for the tab from our political tiki bar.

Pasch originally claimed that Ryan promised to end health care for seniors and now she says his Medicare plan is a ""move toward not promising health care to seniors."" That’s quite a step back from the original claim. Moreover, we’ve established that, although it’s expected that senior citizens would pay more for health care under Ryan’s plan, they would still have health care.

At PolitiFact, we have a name for the drink that’s made by mixing false and ridiculous. It’s called Pants on Fire, and that’s what we rate Pasch’s claim.",/factchecks/2011/jun/10/sandy-pasch/democratic-wisconsin-state-rep-sandy-pasch-says-go/
"['Georgia', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Kevin Bloye']","
Trauma Centers Save Lives Just Not as Many as People Think
","
Georgia voters are suspicious of new taxes.

How suspicious are they?

Last year, they voted down an amendment that would have added a $10 fee to the cost of registering a motor vehicle to pay for additional trauma centers in the state. This wasn’t a penny sales tax to polish the Capitol dome, this was an attempt to improve emergency medical care.

Proponents of the tax, such as Kevin Bloye, a spokesman for the Georgia Hospital Association, say the money would have helped Georgia lower the number of trauma deaths by creating more emergency medical facilities designed to treat trauma patients.

Bloye said in a news story that appeared in the AJCin March that roughly 700 Georgians die needlessly each year because they are too far from a trauma center.

Right now, there are only 18 medical facilities that specialize in treatment of physical injuries, according to the Georgia Department of Community Health.

Many of these facilities are clustered in the Atlanta metro area, leaving portions of South Georgia without immediate access to trauma care.

So the argument is the state could save lives if the number of trauma centers in South Georgia was, say, closer to  the number of billboards advertising Asian massage parlors along I-75.

It’s hard to argue with that logic, but we felt the number ""roughly 700"" deaths seemed high, so we decided to take a closer look.

The number comes from an extrapolation of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study of trauma deaths in each state, Bloye said.

""It does vary from year to year, but in the year we put it together, it was 712,"" he said.

Dr. Patrick O’Neal, deputy director of the Georgia Department of Community Health’s Division of Emergency Preparedness and Response, prepared this number for the hospital association about seven years ago.

O’Neal used CDC estimates to determine that if Georgia lowered its trauma death rate to the national average, the state could save 712 lives in that particular year. He didn’t remember if he used data from 2004 or 2005.

Since O’Neal’s analysis, the CDC has updated its data for that year, and the difference between the national trauma death rate and Georgia’s rate is closer, he said.

So that number is no longer accurate.

Another problem is that O’Neal examined only one year, but Bloye said roughly 700 lives could be saved ""each year.""

Bloye’s not alone. Organizations, such as Georgia Watch, the nonprofit consumer advocacy group, also have said an estimated 700 people die each year because of inadequate trauma care in the state.

The number has often been repeated in news reports, including by the AJC.

Turns out no one should use that statistic.

PolitiFact used O’Neal’s methodology and the CDC’s current data and found that if Georgia had the same rate of trauma deaths as the national average in 2007, the latest data available, the state could have saved 455 lives. The state would have saved 329 lives in 2006, 415 in 2005, 623 in 2004 and 719 in 2003.

These numbers are based on the CDC’s age-adjusted rate of trauma deaths for the state and the nation. Statisticians adjust rates of illness, death and injury by age so communities with different age structures can be compared to one another.

Using the unadjusted data, the number of lives saved drops even lower. According to these numbers, the state would have saved 120 lives in 2007, 2 lives in 2006, 88 in 2005, 306 in 2004 and 402 in 2003.

Even considering these are estimates, neither the adjusted nor the unadjusted numbers fall in the ""roughly 700"" range.

There’s another issue as well.

Bloye said Georgians died needlessly because ""they are too far from a trauma center.""

But O’Neal said the number of ambulances and the quality of ambulance service along with other public policy issues such as developing programs to combat violent crime also play a role in reducing the trauma death rate in Georgia.

""There’s some truth in [Bloye’s statement], but it’s simplistic,"" he said.

The statement holds some truth in that Georgia is consistently above the national average in trauma deaths, according to CDC statistics. And if Georgia lowered the number of trauma deaths to the national average through a comprehensive approach including the creation of new trauma centers, better emergency transportation and innovative public policy approaches, hundreds of lives would be saved each year.

In 2003, Georgia could have saved 719 lives if the state had matched the national rate of trauma deaths; since then, the number is not in the ""roughly 700"" range, according to CDC data. But with more trauma centers, the state could save hundreds of lives.

Bloye’s statement contains some elements of truth, but it ignores critical facts that would give the reader a different impression.

That’s PolitiFact’s definition of Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/10/kevin-bloye/trauma-centers-save-lives-just-not-many-people-thi/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Doug Otto']","
Plano schools' chief says Rick Perry said there's a 1-to-1 ratio of administrators to teachers in Texas schools
","
A Dallas-area school leader concerned about state education aid zeroed in on what he characterized as a ridiculous claim by Gov. Rick Perry.

In an interview with KRLD-AM’s Scott Braddock posted online March 22, Doug Otto, superintendent of the Plano school district, said the district would adjust to any state reductions by cutting administrative and teaching posts. Asked about whittling first outside classrooms, Otto replied: ""Well, certainly we’re going to do that as much as we can... But it’s disingenuous, as the governor says, that somehow we have one administrator for every teacher. That’s idiocy.""

Otto’s claim about Perry came to our attention after a reader asked us to check a May follow-up interview the governor gave the radio host.

Perry, stressing school districts will ultimately decide which employees to shed due to tight budgets, said in the May 11 interview: ""In Texas now, we’ve hired a huge number of non-teachers into our public schools — administrators, et cetera.""

Braddock then asked: ""Do you stand by the number you gave previously, that there was (a) 1-to-1 ratio of administrators to teachers?""

Perry: ""That is absolutely correct.""

Later, Braddock told us he posed his question that way because of Otto’s earlier characterization of Perry’s view. But we found no evidence that Perry has ever cited a 1-to-1 ratio of teachers to administrators.

What Perry did say, in early March, was that non-classroom positions are on the rise. ""Over the course of the last decade, we have seen a rather extraordinary amount of non-classroom employees added to (Texas public) school rolls,"" he told reporters.

We checked that statement and found that from 1998-99 to 2009-10, the number of non-classroom employees — especially in support and administrative staff — outpaced growth in student enrollment and teachers, though whether this growth qualifies as ""extraordinary"" is open to debate. Nevertheless, we rated Perry’s statement Mostly True.

Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said by email the governor meant to say just that in the May interview -- that the ratio of non-teachers to teachers is 1-to-1.

Similarly, in March 2010 we rated Mostly True a statement saying there were about the same number of teachers as non-teachers in Texas in 2008-09. Non-teaching staff is a broad category that includes administrators, typically superintendents, principals, registrars, tax assessor-collectors and athletic and personnel directors and the like, as well as other school employees ranging from custodial staff to librarians.

In 2009-10, according to the Texas Education Agency, teachers filled half of the state’s 661,286 full-time school district posts. Administrators accounted for 4 percent of the remaining positions.  

By email, Otto told us he thinks he saw Perry’s 1-to-1 claim in a newspaper story.

Jim Hirsch, another Plano administrator, provided links to news stories. A March 18 Fort Worth Star-Telegram article attributed that erroneous 1-to-1 claim to the Texas Young Republican Federation, but none quoted Perry saying there’s a teacher for every administrator.

Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno says the Business Retention and Relocation Assistance Grant program helped Panasonic stay in New Jersey
","
The Panasonic Corporation of North America recently threatened to break off its relationship with New Jersey and leave the Garden State.

New Jersey, not willing to end the relationship, offered up tax credits to coax Panasonic to stay.

The offer worked.

Instead of moving its North American headquarters to Atlanta, Brooklyn, California or Chicago, Panasonic is relocating to Newark from Secaucus -- a move that will net the company up to $102.4 million in tax breaks through the Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit program.

Did that grant ultimately sway Panasonic?

Not according to a recent radio interview with Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno. On WNYC, Guadagno touted the Business Retention and Relocation Assistance Grant, or BRRAG, program as the initiative that kept Panasonic in New Jersey.

Near the beginning of a more than 20-minute interview, WNYC host Brian Lehrer asked Guadagno specifically about the BRRAG program, which was revised in January to increase the amount of tax credits companies can receive.

""I read that, as we go down some of your initiatives, that one of your programs is to beef up the Business Retention and Relocation Assistance Grant program so that it's $2,250 annually for six years for every job retained in New Jersey, compared to $1,500 for just one year in the past. Do I have the numbers right and is that an important change?"" Lehrer asked.

Guadagno said ""it’s a crucial change"" and confirmed the numbers.

""It's a very lucrative program. We're winning that game based on the program,"" she said. ""For example, I think you've probably read, Panasonic is staying in New Jersey based on that program and some other incentives.""

Guadagno then talked about other companies that are choosing to stay in New Jersey. Lehrer shifted the conversation back to Panasonic.

""I know Mayor (Cory) Booker called that a game-changer for the City of Newark the other day. But on the retention, how much do you think those dollar figures matter? Because some people question whether a per job ... payment program just makes businesses that don't plan to leave threaten to leave and we've seen in other states that they're not binding anyway. So then some businesses abolish some jobs in a few months or even a few years and then they get paid for pretending to retain others. I'm sure you've seen those kind of things go on. So how do you cost it out in a way you know you are not going to get scammed?""

Guadagno answered: ""Well, there's a couple of issues there. First of all, let's stick with Panasonic for just a minute. Panasonic is a multi-national company who was leaving New Jersey, certified in their records that they were out the door ... It's not a surprise that they could go anywhere in the world. So we went to them and said, ‘Stay in New Jersey; use these incentive programs.’ So, we were able to keep Panasonic solely because of the existence of this incentive program.""

Really? PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check, and found Guadagno was wrong to brag about BRRAG.

""We did not apply for that grant,"" said Peter Fannon, vice president of technology policy at Panasonic. But, he said,  ""with the help of the transit credit we were able to stay in New Jersey.""

Panasonic applied for a $102.4 million Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit. If the company doesn’t create an additional 200 jobs at the Newark site during the next 10 years, it will qualify for 80 percent of the tax credit, or $81.9 million, according to a state Economic Development Authority memo.

The EDA, which administers tax credit programs, approved Panasonic’s application on Feb. 16.

Laura Jones, spokeswoman for the state agency, said companies that receive Urban Transit Hub Tax Credits aren’t eligible to get BRRAGs.

""You can’t get both a hub and a BRRAG,"" she said.

PolitiFact New Jersey went back to Guadagno’s staff with the conflicting information.

The lieutenant governor’s spokesman, Fred Snowflack, said Guadagno wasn’t trying to deliberately mislead listeners during the radio interview.

""You can understand the overall point that she was trying to make: that it was from incentives from the state that kept Panasonic in New Jersey,"" he said.

Let’s review.

Guadagno claimed BRRAG helped Panasonic stay in New Jersey. Panasonic said BRRAG wasn’t a factor in the company’s decision and the state EDA confirmed Panasonic is not eligible for any tax credits through that program.

We rate this statement False.

"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'Chris Christie']","
Gov. Chris Christie claims only 17 of 150,000 tenured New Jersey teachers have been dismissed for incompetence in the past 10 years
","
In his ongoing attempts at education reform in New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie has a statistic to prove his point that tenure in the public school system provides a ""job for life"": only 17 out of 150,000 tenured teachers have been dismissed for incompetence during the past decade.

The Republican governor offered those figures during his April 29 address before about 250 students and professors at Harvard University's Graduate School of Education.

Here’s what Christie told the Ivy League institution:

""In New Jersey, despite whatever the union will tell you, tenure is a job for life after three years and one day. It is a job for life. Here’s the evidence of it. We have about 150,000 public school teachers in New Jersey. In the last ten years how many teachers do you believe were dismissed for incompetence who were tenured teachers? Now keep it in context. Ten years at 150,000, 1.5M (1.5 million) opportunities to do this in the last ten years. The answer is seventeen. Seventeen in ten years.""

PolitiFact New Jersey was intrigued by the low number, and we reached out to the governor’s office and the state Department of Education to check it.

The governor’s representatives could not prove there have been 150,000 tenured teachers during the past decade, but state records mostly support Christie’s argument that only 17 teachers were removed from the classroom following charges of ""inefficiency"" or ""incompetence"" during the past 10 years.

First, let’s talk about that bigger number -- 150,000 tenured teachers?

According to the New Jersey Department of Education’s website, the number of certified teachers climbed from 102,723 in the 2001-02 school year to about 114,704 in the 2009-10 school year. Those figures likely include nontenured teachers.

PolitiFact New Jersey submitted an open public records request seeking, in part, documents detailing the number of tenured teachers in the public school system from 2000 to 2011, but state education officials told us they don’t have any such records.

We reached out to the governor’s office for an explanation of the 150,000 figure, but two phone messages were never returned.

Now, let’s return to those 17 dismissals cited by Christie at Harvard.

Through the same open public records request, state education officials provided records of 17 cases from between 2001 and 2010 where tenured individuals were dismissed or resigned from their jobs following charges of inefficiency or incompetence.

Christie had used the word ""incompetence,"" but education spokesman Alan Guenther told us the correct term is ""inefficiency,"" which covers incompetence. The cases typically involve teachers failing to provide adequate instruction for students.

PolitiFact New Jersey found a few discrepancies between Christie’s statement and the records provided by the education department.

Christie said 17 teachers were dismissed, but the records show that nine individuals resigned through settlement agreements and another person resigned before an agreement was reached. 

The remaining seven individuals were dismissed from their positions by the commissioner or acting commissioner of education.

Also, the 17 individuals include a social worker, a facilities manager and a secretary.

We also conducted our own review of more than 140 legal decisions available on the Department of Education’s website involving tenure hearings during the past decade.

That research turned up only two cases ending in teacher dismissals between 2001 and 2010 involving inefficiency charges that were not included in the records provided by the education department.

Excluding cases involving inefficiency or incompetence, 64 staff members in public schools were dismissed between 2001 and 2010 for other tenure charges, such as unbecoming conduct, according to decisions on the department’s website. Another eight individuals lost their jobs by other means in the face of tenure charges.

Here’s where all that research leaves us:

If we include the case involving the social worker, our research and the records provided to us support Christie’s statement that 17 teachers left their jobs following charges of inefficiency or incompetence.

A New Jersey Education Association spokesman and a Rutgers professor took exception to Christie’s figure.

NJEA spokesman Steve Baker pointed to state data showing that, on average, nearly 40 percent of first-year certified staff members in New Jersey do not attain tenure. By the time individuals attain tenure, they have proven to be competent teachers, Baker said.

""Because they are essentially at-will employees for three years, there is no way to know why each one left or was not brought back. However, it is clear that a large number were dismissed, or chose to leave, because they were not effective,"" Baker wrote in an email. ""Those who make it through the process and earn tenure have already pretty convincingly demonstrated to their administrators that they are effective and capable.""

Bruce Baker, an associate professor in the Graduate School of Education at Rutgers University, who is not related to Steve Baker, said the 17 figure is not very meaningful because teachers are dismissed before reaching tenure status or they’re forced out later without charges being filed.

There also is no benchmark of how many bad teachers are out there, Baker said.

Two experts said proving charges of inefficiency and incompetence presents a challenge to school districts.

The existing evaluation system makes it difficult to determine ineffectiveness among tenured teachers, said Patrick McGuinn, an associate professor of political science at Drew University. The cost and time involved in pursuing such tenure cases also are disincentives for districts, he said.

Middlesex County attorney David Rubin, who represents various school districts, added: ""What constitutes lousy teaching is somewhat subjective to begin with.""

Let’s return to Christie’s statement:

The governor said 17 out of 150,000 tenured teachers were dismissed for incompetence in the last 10 years. The 150,000 figure is off, since state records show no more than 114,704 certified teachers have been working in the past decade. But state records back up his statement about the 17 cases involving inefficiency or incompetence charges.

Still, his underlying point is largely correct. The state has tens of thousands of teachers and only 17 have lost their jobs through dismissals or resignations in the past decade following charges of incompetence or inefficiency.

We rate his statement Mostly True.

"['Environment', 'New Jersey', 'New Jersey Sierra Club']","
New Jersey Sierra Club claims state loses from 8,000 to 10,000 acres annually to development in “bear country”
","
The ongoing dispute between the New Jersey Sierra Club and state officials goes beyond whether the state should host another bear hunt this year. It’s also about how they each define ""bear country.""

To the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, ""bear country"" refers to where the December 2010 hunt took place in seven northern New Jersey counties. To New Jersey Sierra Club Director Jeff Tittel, ""bear country"" extends to bear habitats in points further south.

The questions surrounding ""bear country"" stem from the Sierra Club’s recent comments regarding habitat loss. In a press release opposing another hunt this year, the Sierra Club offered a list of ways to manage New Jersey’s bear population, including ""protecting habitat.""

""Every year the state loses 8,000-10,000 acres of land in bear country,"" according to a May 17 press release. ""The more we build houses in the middle of the woods where bears live, the more conflict we will see between bears and humans.""

That estimate of acreage loss caught the attention of PolitiFact New Jersey, especially since New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the country.

Whether the Sierra Club’s numbers are accurate hinges on that original question -- where is ""bear country?""

First, let’s start with how the Sierra Club arrived at its habitat loss figures.

Tittel told us in an email that the Sierra Club’s estimate was based on annual land losses compiled through the the Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis at Rutgers University.

In his email, Tittel said the Sierra Club looked at the ""Northern and Western Counties of NJ that have Bears."" By acres lost, Tittel said he was referring to acres developed and fragmented by development, such as the impacts to the edge of a forested area.

But when PolitiFact New Jersey examined the recent research done by the center, the Sierra Club’s numbers didn’t add up -- at least when looking at the seven counties where the 2010 bear hunt occurred.

Between 2002 and 2007, the combined urban growth in those seven counties totaled 4,780 acres per year -- not the 8,000-to-10,000 figure cited by the Sierra Club, according to a July 2010 report from the center director and another professor.

But the total impact on bear habitat goes beyond just the number of acres developed, said Rowan University associate professor John Hasse, who co-authored the July 2010 report. Each acre developed affects wildlife habitat in the surrounding area, Hasse said.

The Sierra Club misfired in terms of growth where the 2010 bear hunt occurred, but Tittel told PolitiFact New Jersey that ""bear country"" -- there’s that phrase again! -- is larger than where the hunt took place.

Tittel argued that sizable bear populations also exist in four other counties not included in the 2010 hunt. When combining the annual growth rates in those counties with the figures from the counties where the 2010 hunt occurred, the new total is 8,806 acres per year, according to the center’s report.

""Bear Country is where there are (breeding) populations and good habitat, not where there is a hunt,"" Tittel wrote in a May 23 email.

But DEP spokesman Larry Ragonese said ""bear country"" should be defined as where last year’s hunt occurred. The bear population has been the most predominant in northwest New Jersey, he said.

Yet DEP records back up Tittel’s point that bears can be found outside of where the hunt was held.

Bears can find suitable habitats in southern parts of New Jersey, and the most recent DEP statistics show bear activity in seven counties not included in the 2010 hunt.

Despite the questions surrounding acreage loss estimates, the Sierra Club correctly states that habitat loss will lead to greater conflicts between bears and humans. Development creates easier access to food for the bruins, increasing their birth rate and survivability, said Larry Katz, a professor of animal sciences at Rutgers University.

""We move into an area and we create more habitat,"" Katz said. ""They’re not frightened off by us.""

Before we give the Sierra Club its rating on the Truth-O-Meter, let’s remember something about all that land being lost to development -- construction activity has taken a sharp downturn in New Jersey and across the country.

According to a report prepared by the New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development, the number of residential building permits authorized in New Jersey decreased by about 50 percent from 25,400 in 2007 to 12,396 in 2009.

Back to the Sierra Club’s statement, let’s review:

The environmental organization said between 8,000 and 10,000 acres annually is lost to development in ""bear country,"" citing the research done by the Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis.

But in the counties where the 2010 bear hunt was held, the center’s research pegged growth at 4,780 acres per year. When you throw in figures from other counties mentioned by Tittel, the acreage loss fits within the 8,000-10,000 range in the Sierra Club’s original statement. State records show bear activity in counties outside of last year’s hunting areas.

One professor acknowledged that the loss of bear habitat goes beyond the number of acres developed. The Sierra Club’s underlying point -- habitat loss leads to more bear-human conflicts -- also is in line with the perspective of an animal sciences professor.

Still, the Sierra Club’s argument about the pace of development is undercut by the decline in construction activity statewide.

We rate the statement Half True.

State Sen. Loretta Weinberg says six of New Jersey’s 58 family planning centers closed because of budget cuts
","
The elimination of nearly $7.5 million in funding for family planning services helped state lawmakers plug a multibillion-dollar budget gap last year.

But that’s not all it did, according to state Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen).

She says the cuts forced six of 58 family planning centers to close.

""In the current budget, the budget under which we are operating, the governor stripped out seven and a half million dollars that went to family planning centers throughout the state of New Jersey,"" Weinberg said at a discussion she hosted with women’s health care providers and other female Democratic legislators. ""At the beginning of this current budget year, we had 58 family planning centers, we now have 52. Six have closed and others have cut back their hours.""

PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check this claim, as lawmakers continue battling over funding for family planning services in New Jersey and nationally.

In June 2010, the state Assembly and Senate passed a bill that would restore the $7.45 million in funding cut for family planning services. Gov. Chris Christie vetoed the bill, S2139, saying New Jersey residents have access to ""comprehensive reproductive health care services"" at other sites and the state can’t afford to ""provide duplicative funding for family planning centers.""

Since then, Donna Leusner, spokeswoman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services, said her agency has been notified that six sites have closed: Westampton and Brown Mills locations run by the Burlington County Health Department; Planned Parenthood of Southern New Jersey’s Cherry Hill center; FamCare, Inc.’s Millville facility; the Bayonne Women’s Health and Family Planning Center; and Planned Parenthood of Greater Northern New Jersey’s Dover site. 
The state Senate passed another bill, S2899, on May 23 that would restore the funding, but the Assembly has not yet voted on the measure.

The organizations that ran the six centers told PolitiFact New Jersey that state funding cuts forced the closures.

Ralph Shrom, a spokesman for Burlington County, said the Westampton clinic and a satellite location at Deborah Hospital in Brown Mills closed at the end of 2010.

In Camden County, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southern New Jersey Lynn Brown said her organization closed its family planning services center in Cherry Hill, a site that was operating one day a week, in fall 2010.

A Millville location run by FamCare, Inc. that also operated one day a week closed on Dec. 1, according to Kimberly McKown-Strait, the organization’s executive director.

The women’s health center in Bayonne officially closed on April 29, Bayonne spokesman Joe Ryan said.

Triste Brooks, the president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood of Greater Northern New Jersey, said the organization’s Dover site closed at the end of 2010. 

So let’s review: Six family planning clinics closed during the past fiscal year and representatives from each blamed the loss of state funding for the closure. Christie signed a budget that eliminated $7.45 million in funding for family planning services that the Democratic-controlled Legislature passed. The governor also vetoed a measure that would have restored the funding.

We rate Weinberg’s statement that the governor’s cuts forced six family planning centers to close True.

Anonymous GOP officials claim commerce nominee John Bryson endorses world government
","Supporting climate change policy is one thing, but is Barack Obama’s nominee for commerce secretary, John Bryson, an advocate for world government?

That's the speculation raised by anonymous GOP sources on Capitol Hill, according to the conservative website the Daily Caller.

Bryson, former chief executive officer and chairman of Southern California energy conglomerate Edison International and co-founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, has been under fire due to his support for clean-energy legislation. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., called him an ""environmental extremist"" and Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., a global warming skeptic, says he fears Bryson would implement climate change policy that would hurt American businesses. Bryson's nomination is also opposed by Massachusetts Democrats, Reps. Barney Frank and John Tierney, because of the NRDC's fight for fishing-catch limits.

But the claim that Bryson supports a ""world government"" raises the rhetoric to a new level.

The speculation originated in a June 7, 2011, story in the Daily Caller that ran under the headline: ""Commerce nominee appears to endorse world government in video, Republicans say.""

Here's how the story begins:
 
Does John Bryson, Barack Obama’s nominee for commerce secretary, want a world government?

Critics say a newly uncovered video of the nominee suggests that he does.

In the video – given to The Daily Caller by sources on Capitol Hill – Bryson refers to the 2009 United Nations climate negotiations in Copenhagen as ""the closest thing we have to a world governance organization,"" implying it provided the best model for imposing climate regulations on countries around the globe.

Bryson also boasts about his role as an adviser to the U.N. secretary general on climate change in the video.

The story includes a link to a 1-minute and 25-second clip of Bryson making a formal presentation to an unidentified group. Here's the fuller context from the attached video:

""I thought that one of the things that is, in my judgment, not as well covered in the press and not as well understood as it ought to be is the kind of global picture on addressing clean energy and climate change. One of the things that have been a particular pleasure for me over the last year is I’ve been working as an adviser to the Secretary General of the United Nations on that subject. So I thought I would talk a little about that, talk a little about Copenhagen, a little bit about the global environmental and energy picture as I see it. Where we are. Where we might go. I thought I’d start there…So, let’s start with Copenhagen. So Copenhagen, obviously the United Nations is the global entity, the closest thing we have to a world governance organization. Copenhagen negotiations take place under the auspices of the United Nations as does the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), the side of the body that’s developed this growing consensus about the effects of carbon emissions, greenhouse gas emissions on climate change.""

That seems like pretty flimsy evidence on which to base speculation that Bryson ""appears to endorse world government."" So we contacted Daily Caller reporter John Rossomando to find out who provided the video and made the claims. Rossomando wrote back that, ""it came from GOP officials on the Hill, of whom I am not a liberty to name.""

We tracked the origin of the video to a presentation Bryson made at an energy symposium hosted by the University of California Berkeley on March 4, 2010. It's actually about an hour-long speech, with a brief Q & A, which you can watch here.

In the passage in question (at about the 10-minute mark), Bryson was talking about the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, commonly known as the Copenhagen Summit, and the perception that nothing was accomplished because no treaty was reached.

Bryson made a case that, actually, they did accomplish a good deal. Although it fell short of the binding pact hoped for by many environmental groups, the summit produced a nonbinding emissions deal knows as the Copenhagen Accord.

According to a New York Times account on Dec. 20, 2009, ""The plan does not firmly commit the industrialized nations or the developing nations to firm targets for midterm or long-term greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The accord is nonetheless significant in that it codifies the commitments of individual nations to act on their own to tackle global warming.""

""That means there was no binding legal obligations that came out of what happened in Copenhagen,"" Bryson said in his Berkeley address. ""...But those are nonetheless commitments on behalf of the leaders of those countries.""

""Certainly bringing the nations of the world together around addressing climate change and moving toward consensus and effective agreement on working together is vitally important,"" Bryson said.

Bryson talked about the need to think about climate change on a global basis, but at no point did he advocate for ceding power to the United Nations, let alone advocating anything as extreme as creating a world government.

Brian Darling, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who was quoted in the Daily Caller story, said it may be a rhetorical stretch to suggest that Bryson was advocating a world government. However, Darling said, what Bryson said on the video is of concern. Bryson seems to suggest that he supports giving the U.N. ""authority to impose climate change policy on other countries."" At the least, he said, Bryson ought to be questioned by Congress about the video and made to explain his position.

Myron Ebell, a climate-change skeptic at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, said the portion of the clip posted by the Daily Caller ""implies that (Bryson) supports global governing institutions. That is, he supports Kyoto and successor agreements to require mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. These international agreements are administered by an institution, the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), that is administered by the UN, which Bryson says is 'the closest thing we have to a world governance organization.'  Supporting the Kyoto Protocol thus seems to imply that he supports some sort of world governance organization. But not quite necessarily.""

However, Ebell said, ""supporting some global institutions that govern some aspects of life is not the same as supporting world government."" To suggest the clip is evidence that Bryson supports a world government is a ""stretch,"" he said. ""I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that he does, but more evidence is required to establish what he really believes or supports.  I think that what we do know about Mr. Bryson already is sufficient to disqualify him to be Secretary of Commerce from our perspective, which is why we oppose his confirmation.""

We contacted the White House press office to see where Bryson stands on the whole ""world government"" issue, but they declined to comment, saying the fuller context of Bryson's statement -- even in the short clip on the Daily Caller site -- is enough to definitively refute the claim.

We agree. Referring to the United Nations as ""the closest thing we have to a world governance organization"" isn't exactly a smoking gun. We didn't hear any evidence in Bryson's full, hour-long address that suggests he wants to cede the U.S. government's authority over climate change policy to the United Nations, let alone something as radical and all-encompassing as a world government. No wonder the GOP officials who leaked the video and provided the speculation decided to remain anonymous.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz compares GOP-backed voting bills to Jim Crow
","
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. -- the new chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee -- provoked controversy recently when she compared Republican efforts to heighten scrutiny of voters at the polls to Jim Crow laws -- the primary tool that supported segregation and white supremacy in the South between the 1880s and the 1960s.

On June 5, 2011, Wasserman Schultz was interviewed by Roland Martin, an African American political commentator for CNN and the host of a weekly public-affairs show on the TV One cable network. Martin brought up the topic of voter-identification laws.

Here’s a portion of their conversation.

""Republicans are backing measures that will require photo identification and other types of things, including cutting the number of days for early voting,"" Martin said. ""Republicans say it will cut down on voter fraud. Critics contend it's a step backwards, and it would discriminate against the poor, elderly, students, people with disabilities, and minorities. … Your home state – Gov. Rick Scott is leading one of these efforts, and for the life of me, I don't understand whenever I see Republicans or even Democrats contesting votes and things along those lines. We talk about this is the fundamental right to be Americans, but to put roadblocks up to – to – for voting makes no sense to me.""

Wasserman Schultz responded, ""Well, I mean if you go back to the year 2000, when we had an obvious disaster and – and saw that our voting process needed refinement, and we did that in (the Help America Vote Act) and made sure that we could iron out those kinks -- now you have the Republicans, who want to literally drag us all the way back to Jim Crow laws and literally – and very transparently – block access to the polls to voters who are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates than Republican candidates. And it's nothing short of that blatant.""

She went on to say that the DNC considers photo ID laws to be ""very similar to a poll tax. I mean you look – just look at African-American voters as a snapshot. About 25 percent of African-American voters don't have a valid photo ID. I mean – and – and the reason it's similar to a poll tax is because you've got the expense. You've got the effort. There's difficulties for … many people in getting a photo ID. So, you're literally just throwing a barrier in the way of someone who's trying to exercise their right to vote.""

Wasserman Schultz continued, ""And the reason that it's not necessary is because we already have very legitimate voter verification processes, signature checks that are already in place; and there is so little voter fraud, which is the professed reason the Republicans are advancing these – these laws. There's so little voter fraud, and I mean you're more likely to get hit by lightning than you are to see an instance of voter fraud in this country, but Republicans are imposing laws all over the country, acting like it's not – voter fraud is rampant, and it's ridiculous.""

Not long after the interview, Republicans pounced on the Jim Crow comparison, arguing that comparing voter ID laws to poll taxes, literacy tests and other Jim Crow laws was not only inaccurate from a policy perspective but was tantamount to calling the GOP racist.

Later that day, Wasserman Schultz acknowledged that she had gone too far in her terminology, though she reiterated her opposition to the Republican-backed voter law policies.

""Jim Crow was the wrong analogy to use,"" Wasserman Schultz said. ""But I don't regret calling attention to the efforts in a number of states with Republican dominated legislatures, including Florida, to restrict access to the ballot box for all kinds of voters, but particularly young voters, African Americans and Hispanic Americans."" In addition to voter ID laws, she and her allies have also criticized proposals that would restrict early voting and place burdens on registration drives.

At PolitiFact, we do not typically fact-check statements that are quickly retracted by the speaker. However, we made an exception in this case because we expect voter identification laws and other election-process issues to remain a significant and divisive issue in the 2012 election. For this reason, we thought a historical comparison of Jim Crow laws and today’s voter-identification laws would be of interest to readers (and to us).

At this time, we won’t delve deeply into the policy details of the current legislative proposals. Instead, we’re going to focus on the big-picture similarities and differences with Jim Crow laws.

To do this, we reached out to about a dozen scholars and found a striking array of opinions, many of them passionate. Some -- many of them historians of the Jim Crow era -- believed that the comparison was justified. Others -- many of them election-law experts -- argued that the comparison was over the top.

First, here’s the case for arguing that the current crop of voter laws are similar to Jim Crow laws.

• Voting restrictions were the linchpin of Jim Crow. Preventing blacks from voting enabled the subsequent imposition of other segregationist laws. ""Exclusion from the franchise was the centerpiece of the system that was put in place in the late 19th century,"" said Robert Korstad, a Duke University historian and coauthor of Remembering Jim Crow: African Americans Tell About Life in the Segregated South.

• Like Jim Crow laws, the new laws are likely to diminish the voter pool. Though the extent is uncertain, most experts agree that some people who would otherwise want to vote will be disenfranchised. And many agree that minorities will be hit disproportionately.

The United States is unusual among advanced industrialized countries in promulgating an ""enormous discouragement of voting,"" said Glenda Gilmore, a Yale University professor of history, American Studies and African American Studies and coauthor of Jumpin’ Jim Crow. ""Historians of the South use the term ‘Jim Crow laws’ to mean discouraging voting in a way that impacts minority voters. So, I think that she was exactly right in her use of the phrase.""

In fact, some of the potential legal challenges to today’s new laws will argue they violate the 24th Amendment’s prohibition against the poll tax.  

• Allegations of fraud were also used to support the initial imposition of Jim Crow voting laws. Jane Dailey, a historian at the University of Chicago and author of Gender and Jim Crow: Women and the Politics of White Supremacy in North Carolina, 1896-1920, agrees that Wasserman Schultz’s comparison ""is historically accurate,"" in part because the justifications were the same.

""Groups interested in limiting political competition have always justified suffrage restrictions as necessary checks on election fraud,"" Dailey said. ""Like today's GOP, turn-of-the-century southern Democrats argued that poll taxes and literacy tests would reduce fraud at the polls.""

• Even laws that are superficially race-neutral can have serious effects on minorities. Many of the Jim Crow voting laws were not explicitly written to favor white voters over black voters, even though they had that practical effect.

""There was nothing, on the surface, that made those laws anti-black. It was how they were enforced that became critical,"" said William H. Chafe, a Duke University historian and coauthor with Korstad of Remembering Jim Crow: African Americans Tell About Life in the Segregated South. ""The laws provided political officials with the tools to discriminate against whom they wished.""

Now, we’ll present the case for arguing that the current crop of voter laws are different from Jim Crow laws.

• Jim Crow laws had much higher rates of disenfranchisement. Jim Crow laws disenfranchised all or virtually all of the potential black voters in southern states. Not even critics suggest that will happen today with voter ID laws.

""Black voter participation, which in some places had been 90 percent of eligible male voters in the late 1860s and early 1870s, was cut to essentially zero by early decades of 20th century,"" said Michael J. Klarman, a professor at Harvard Law School and the author of From Jim Crow to Civil Rights: The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality. ""What Republicans are doing now … is trivial by comparison. They are making it marginally harder for poor people, disproportionately minority, to vote.""

• It’s much easier for minorities to abide by a voter ID law than a Jim Crow law. Getting an identification card may be a hassle, but it’s not as challenging as learning how to read.

""Unlike with Jim Crow laws, there are ways voters can avoid this loss of voting rights,"" said Rob Richie, the executive director of FairVote, a non-partisan group that works to expand voter turnout and improve how elections are run.

Thomas Adams Upchurch -- a historian at East Georgia College and author of several works on race relations in the South, including Legislating Racism: The Billion Dollar Congress and the Birth of Jim Crow-- agreed, saying that ""people find the money to afford those things that are important to them, and they make a way to do those things that they value. If people want to vote, they should have a photo ID.""

• Jim Crow was about much more than just voter disenfranchisement. While laws to restrict voting were an important part of the system of Jim Crow, they were just one part, said James C. Cobb, a University of Georgia historian and author of several books on the South, including The Brown Decision, Jim Crow, And Southern Identity. Legalized discrimination in the South ran the gamut from separate hotels and buses to to unequal schools to separate water fountains.

Today, invoking the term Jim Crow in a policy debate seems like an unnecessarily broad -- not to mention provocative -- way for Wasserman Schultz to make her case against voter ID laws.

""Jim Crow regimes involved relentless efforts to stop all African Americans from voting and included brutal intimidation tactics, like lynching,"" said Heather Gerken, a Yale Law School professor who specializes in election law. ""I don’t think photo ID rises to that level, and I don’t think she thinks so either.""

• Jim Crow was unadulterated racism. Voter ID laws are not. Richard Hasen, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and a specialist in election law, said that intent matters.

""Jim Crow laws were intended to hurt African-Americans and make it difficult for them to achieve any political strength,"" Hasen said. ""In contrast, the motives behind the wave of Republican-led voter identification laws and other restrictive voting laws are less clear. At their worst, the laws seem to be motivated to hurt Democrats, including poor and minority voters who tend to vote Democratic,"" which would make it ""partisan, not racial, discrimination.""

Gerken agreed that there’s a difference between what’s intended to do harm and what might do harm as a side effect.

""Photo ID laws are the product of good motives (a desire to prevent fraud) and bad motives (an effort to use election regulations to promote the election chances of the GOP),"" Gerken said. ""The congresswoman is quite right to worry if they have a disparate effect on African Americans, precisely because they continue to suffer from the continuing effects of past discrimination. But the purpose is quite different. Jim Crow was motivated by pure racial animus. Here, the dominant motive is politics.""

It’s true that Wasserman Schultz isn’t the only one who’s made the Jim Crow comparison. Editorials in the New York Times, the Miami Herald, the Memphis Commercial Appeal, the Amarillo Globe News have all referenced Jim Crow laws in this context, as have a smattering of politicians.

Still, we agree with her ultimate decision to retract her use of the phrase. Even if the ultimate effect of these laws is to decrease voter turnout -- and even if the need to prevent voter fraud is not as dire as the laws’ supporters contend -- Wasserman Schultz’s decision to compare the new crop of laws to Jim Crow went too far.

Although there are some similarities in the two sets of laws, they are outweighed both by the differences between them and by the inflammatory nature of the phrase, which all but calls the laws’ supporters racists. The current laws would at worst disenfranchise a fraction of minority voters, not most of them. Unlike with Jim Crow laws, minority voters allow an feasible ""out"" -- getting an ID card. Wasserman Schultz’s comparison reduces an overwhelming apartheid system to one of its facets, voting laws. And Jim Crow was pure racism, whereas the intent behind today’s proposals is, at most, partisan gain -- albeit at the expense of some would-be voters, many of whom are likely to be minorities. Reasonable people can disagree about the wisdom of the new laws, but they would not return the United States to Jim Crow. Saying so offers more heat than light. On balance, we rate her comment False.",/factchecks/2011/jun/09/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-compares-gop-backed-votin/

Economic adviser Brian Deese says auto industry has rebounded with 115,000 jobs
","
As President Barack Obama prepared to go to Toledo on June 3 to laud the American auto industry’s comeback, the White House as well as Sen. Sherrod Brown were prepping the press.

Brian Deese, deputy director of the White House National Economic Council, joined Brown, an Ohio Democrat, June 2 on a telephone news conference call to hail the industry’s resurgence following Chrysler’s and General Motors’ bankruptcies and $62 billion worth of government bailouts.

""We've seen 115,000 jobs created in the American auto industry since GM and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy,"" said Deese, a point man on the auto recovery for the Obama administration. ""More than 8,000 jobs in Ohio,"" he continued. ""That's the best case of job growth in this country since the late '90s in the auto industry.""

These numbers made us pause, because of something The Plain Dealer had published that very day: The two automakers employ 16,500 fewer people nationwide than they did in 2009.

Just looking at Ohio plants, Chrysler downsized its workforce since 2009 while General Motors had an increase. Put together, these resulted in a net gain of 1,496 jobs in the state. These numbers are very different from what the administration cited.

How could that be?

Deese said it’s because he was talking about the overall industry -- U.S. workers at Chrysler and General Motors and also at every other company in the industry. That includes auto parts makers and people employed in car dealerships and parts stores, because parts makers often supply multiple manufacturers and each component  of the industry relies on the other. Deese said his numbers came from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the White House provided us with the data..

We also went to BLS’ databases independently. Deese’s numbers checked out, both nationally and for Ohio, but his starting point left us with some questions.

We found that from June 2009 to April 2011, the most recent month reported, the auto industry rebounded with 115,400 jobs nationwide and 8,200 in Ohio. These were the months Deese used for his measurement..

Why June? Because that’s when Chrysler’s strongest operations emerged from bankruptcy with a new life -- on June 10 -- after filing in April that year.

But General Motors didn’t file for bankruptcy until June 1, 2009, and the bankruptcy didn’t end until July 10. What would the rebound look like, then, if we didn’t start counting until July?  

By waiting to count until the month GM exited bankruptcy, the industry’s nationwide comeback would come to 84,300 jobs, which would put Deese’s claim off by 27 percent nationally. In Ohio, however, he’d still be awfully close, at 7,900.

We bring this up not to nit-pick. Calculations for both time frames show a rebound. But Deese specifically said his numbers showed the success ""since GM and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy,"" and ""emerge"" means to rise from. GM was still engaged in its reorganization when the turnaround started.

The dates Deese chose also happen to show the greatest level of rebound. Would it have been more accurate for him to start his counting a month later, when GM exited bankruptcy?

We asked the Center for Automotive Research, in Ann Arbor, Mich., which analyzes the auto industry and studies its employment trends closely. We also asked Susan Helper, chair of economics at Case Western Reserve University’s Weatherhead School of Management. Both of these sources looked at the BLS data, too.

Kristin Dziczek, director of the Center for Automotive Research labor and research group, told us she thought it was fair for the White House to pick June, even though General Motors didn’t leave bankruptcy until July. ""June is the low point,"" she said, and that’s a good point to start when measuring a comeback.  

Plant closings and layoffs had spread for months before then, and by June the government was involved heavily in GM’s restructuring. In the three months before June 2009, the number of workers in auto plants had dropped by 20,300, according to the BLS.

""I think it’s a fair assessment,"" Dziczek said of Deese’s statement.

Helper, of CWRU, agreed,  noting that while Chrysler’s bankruptcy and the government’s role were surrounded by questions about the legality and propriety of such intervention, the GM bankruptcy was swift and it was apparent from the filing in June that the company would emerge quickly.

And, she asserted, the phrase ""since emerging from bankruptcy"" could be interpreted to include not only these government-aided bankruptcies but also the start of the Cash for Clunkers auto buyback program that Congress passed in June 2009; White House economic policies at the time that were aimed at the broader U.S. economy, and general economic conditions that threatened everything from jobs to car sales. Considering the economic risks at the time, she said, ""conceivably you could argue that the 115,000 figure is an under-estimate"" when measuring the success.

Before we give Deese’s claim a rating, we’ll note two last things.

First, a day after Deese spoke, BLS updated its data, giving figures for May, 2011. Doing a calculation with these figures, we found that had Deese waited a day, he would have had to say 113,200 instead of 115,000. This difference is so minor, but we include it for the sake of accuracy -- and to note that the White House, too, was aware of this slight change. By the time Obama spoke in Toledo that day, he said, ""So far the auto industry has added 113,000 jobs over the past two years.""

Second, some critics still say the administration overstepped its bounds with the bailouts. Taxpayers are expected to lose $14 billion in the end. That’s less than the $48 billion loss that was projected earlier, and much less than it would have cost in pension bailouts and other economy-wide expenses had the automakers failed. But skeptics say the free market -- and outside companies -- might have picked up the pieces without the government needing to intervene. We’ll never know, although Dziczek and Helper say the bailouts helped avoid economic catastrophe.

So we turn to the Truth-O-Meter.

Deese was correct if we measure his statement against job figures for June 2009, when Chrysler left bankruptcy. But General Motors didn’t leave bankruptcy until July 2009, and that produces a lower number.

The Center for Automotive Research’s Dzieczek says it was nevertheless reasonable to start counting at that date, and so does CRWU’s economics chair, Helper. The Obama administration was heavily involved by then, they said, and it’s fair for it to claim all those job gains.

But while the June date may be a reasonable starting point for Deese to have chosen, PolitiFact also is guided by the principles of the Truth-O-Meter. A key one is that words matter. We pay close attention to the specific wording of a claim.

So we go back to Deese’s words: ""since GM and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy.""

GM had not yet climbed out of bankruptcy when Deese starts his count. And that’s important to know because had he started after GM emerged from bankruptcy, the figure for total number of jobs created would have been more than 30,000 fewer.

So Deese’s notion is accurate -- but a listener needs that important detail for a full understanding of his claim. That is exactly how the Truth-O-Meter defines Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/09/brian-deese/economics-adviser-brian-deese-says-auto-industry-h/

Rep. Scott Rigell says U.S. debt could hit $99 trillion this year
","
U.S. Rep. Scott Rigell issued a dire warning recently about the country’s fiscal problems.

""When $14.3 trillion is cited as the total of our national debt, that is only taking into account one part of the equation,"" Rigell, R-2nd, said in a June 3 newsletter e-mailed to constituents. ""When the unfunded liabilities of mandatory entitlement spending are accounted for, the debt really added up to $75 trillion in 2010 and is on track to hit $99 trillion this year.""

It’s widely known that last month, the U.S. government hit its $14.3 trillion ""debt ceiling"" -- the maximum amount it’s allowed to borrow without further congressional authorization.

But when you lump in entitlement spending, was the national debt really $75 trillion in 2010 -- more than five times the debt ceiling? Is the debt really on track to jump another $24 trillion by the end of 2011?

We decided to find out. First, we asked Rigell’s office where these colossal numbers came from.

Kim Mosser, Rigell’s communications director, pointed to an April slide-show presentation on the debt from the House Budget Committee.  It included a graph detailing ""unfunded promises."" For 2010, the graph showed a tally of $76.4 trillion. For 2011, it showed a total of $99.4 trillion -- close to Rigell’s figures.

But exactly what costs are included in those numbers?

Conor Sweeney, the communications director for the Budget Committee, told us the figures come from reports by the Government Accountability Office on the nation’s fiscal outlook.

Looking at those studies, it’s clear the tallies Rigell cites are not, as he suggests, overall debt totals. They are complex and long-term projections used to estimate the 75-year costs of maintaining Social and Medicare under present-day conditions.

Technically, the numbers are GAO estimates of the amount of money needed to keep the level of publicly held debt at its present ratio of debt to gross domestic product for 75 years. The GAO calls it the ""fiscal gap,"" a measure of the shortfall between revenues and spending promises for entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare.

For example, under one scenario, it would take $99.4 trillion in new revenues, measured in current-day dollars, to keep publicly-held debt 75 years from now at 62 percent of GDP -- its level at the beginning of 2011.

That money could come from higher taxes, decreased spending or a combination of both.

In a 2010 report, the GAO estimated it would take $76.4 trillion to keep publicly held debt at its January 2010 level of 53 percent of GDP.

But these are pessimistic projections of the nation’s long-term finances. The $99.4 trillion and $76.4 trillion figures arise from assumptions that most tax cuts will be extended for 10 years, discretionary spending will grow at the pace of GDP, and physician fees under Medicare will grow with inflation.

Under a moderate set of assumptions, the GAO projects the level of money needed to keep the publicly held debt level constant would be much lower -- $31.9 trillion would be needed to keep the debt 75 years from now at its January 2011 level.

Regardless of which scenario is used, the country needs to change its long-term fiscal trajectory, according to the GAO.

Rigell mischaracterizes the GAO’s numbers as total debt, when in reality they measure something different.

Let’s turn to another point. Rigell calls the projected shortfalls in funding entitlement programs for the next 75 years ""unfunded liabilities."" Many economists dispute that contention, noting that Congress is free at any time to reduce or alter the programs.

""Legally, they are not liabilities,"" said J.D. Foster, an economist with the right-leaning Heritage Foundation. ""They can be referred to accurately as promises or obligations.""

But Edward Mazur, a former member of the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, said some social insurance programs should be counted as liabilities until the government alters the parameters of its promises.

To summarize:

Rigell said that the national debt was $75 trillion in 2010 and is projected to be $99 trillion in 2011 when unfunded entitlement costs are factored into the equation.

But his numbers are not based on actual totals of entitlement spending and the debt in any given year. His figures are based on pessimistic 75-year projections of what it would cost to continue entitlement programs under present-day conditions. A lot can change over 75 years.

Rigell is mischaracterizing the nation’s debt level.

DCCC says Hurt voted again to end Medicare
","
On June 6, 2011, PolitiFact Virginia rated as False a statement by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that Rep. Robert Hurt, R-5th, voted ""to end Medicare and raise health care costs for Virginia seniors."" We based that ruling, in part, on a faulty determination that the legislation would not raise health care costs for anyone now 55 or older.

Further review shows about 8 percent of Medicare recipients could see higher costs if the plan Hurt supported is adopted. But given the blanket nature of the DCCC’s statement, which suggests all Virginia seniors would see higher costs, we are maintaining our False rating and providing this new analysis:

When it comes to alarming voters, nothing rings louder than an accusation that a politician wants to harm seniors.

In 2009, Republicans claimed health care reform would set up ""death panels"" that told old people when to die. Now Democrats are returning fire. They’re accusing Republicans, including Rep. Robert Hurt from Virginia’s 5th District, of voting to end Medicare.

""Rep. Robert Hurt voted again today to end Medicare and raise health care costs for Virginia seniors,"" the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said in a June 1 news release. The statement added that seniors will ""get a $6,400 medical bill"" if the GOP plan is adopted.

The DCCC, which works to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives, earned a Pants on Fire in April for claiming Republicans wanted to end Medicare and stick seniors with a $12,500 bill. We wanted to see if this latest attack was true.

What is Congress voting on?

In a partisan vote on April 15, Hurt other House Republicans passed a budget resolution embracing proposals that would overhaul Medicare for young and middle-aged Americans. The plan was put forward by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc, chairman of the House Budget Committee.

Ryan proposed replacing today’s Medicare program with a ""premium support payment."" In 2022, new beneficiaries would buy plans from private insurance companies with financial assistance from the government. People who need more health care would get a little more money. Some call this a voucher program, but the proposal says it’s not a voucher plan, because the government would pay the insurance companies directly.

The proposal requires private insurers to accept all applicants and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would comply with standards to be set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67, and it provides smaller premium support to high earners.

The Congressional Budget Office says Ryan’s plan could save the federal government money, but it would also raise costs for users. The CBO, the nonpartisan budget arm of Congress, estimates beneficiaries would contribute about $6,150 in premiums during 2022 if the current program isn’t changed. Under Ryan’s plan, the CBO estimates beneficiaries would contribute $12,500, more than double what they’d pay under the existing plan.

So the proposal would raise costs for future seniors, but not for anyone now 55 or older. Folks older than that, including those seniors who currently use Medicare, would still use the existing program. Let us say that again, for emphasis: Ryan’s plan would not affect the Medicare coverage for anyone currently 55 or older. But the DCCC is right in saying people using the new system could pay about $6,400 more per year in the future.

The DCCC says the plan would raise costs for current seniors, something we rejected in our initial analysis. Would those who stay on the regular Medicare program see their health care costs go up under the Ryan plan, as the Democratic group says?

Some would, but not enormously. Here’s why:

The Ryan plan would repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed by President Obama in March 2010. Among its myriad provisions, the law would phase out the ""doughnut hole"" a quirk in the current Medicare law that requires people with high-priced prescriptions to shoulder more of the costs.

The Department of Health and Human Services said about 3.9 million people, or roughly 8 percent of people who use Medicare, fell into the doughnut hole in 2009. During 2011, a discount on brand-name drugs under Obama’s reforms is saving those people an average of $553,  according to HHS.

If the health care act is repealed, those people would lose that benefit.

The DCCC issued its press release after House Republicans, including Hurt, passed a procedural resolution on June 1 that also embraced the Ryan plan.

We should note that the Ryan plan, while a bargaining chip in current debt negotiations and likely to be a big issue in the 2012 elections, has no immediate chance of becoming law. The proposal has been rejected by the Democratic-controlled Senate is strongly opposed by President Barack Obama.

And here’s a technical point: Both resolutions supported by Hurt are, as PolitiFact national has noted, non-binding documents that state policy preferences but cannot be viewed as the equivalent of legislation that establishes law. To actually alter Medicare, Congress would have to pass a detailed law changing the U.S. Code.

Would the plan really end Medicare?

The Republican plan would be a huge change to the current program, and future seniors would have to pay more for their health plans if it becomes law. But to say it would end Medicare, as the DCCC email does, is a major exaggeration. All seniors -- current and future -- would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program’s budget would increase every year.

Republicans say future spending projections for Medicare are not sustainable and the program requires changes. Their proposal ""protects and preserves Medicare -- with no disruptions -- for those in and near retirement and provides those now under the age of 55 with a strengthened, personalized Medicare program they can count on when they retire,"" Conor Sweeney, a spokesperson for House Budget Committee, told PolitiFact in April.

Democrats contend that the proposal would change the essential nature of Medicare as a guarantee of health coverage for seniors. The Congressional Budget Office in April released a detailed analysis of the proposal that concluded future beneficiaries would pay more for current levels of coverage, and that some will decide to go without any insurance.

Many Democrats, including the president, said Ryan’s plan would end ""Medicare as we know it."" And that’s a crucial qualifier, since Ryan’s vision for the program is indeed very different from what currently exists.

But the DCCC left that qualifier out of its attack on Hurt.

Our ruling

The DCCC says Hurt voted ""to end Medicare and raise health care costs for Virginia seniors.""

Hurt has indeed cast votes for the Ryan plan, which would substantially alter Medicare for many Americans. But beyond that, the DCCC statement falls apart.

The Ryan plan would not end Medicare for anyone. The government would continue to help all older Americans pay for their medical bills.

And the plan would not mean any change in costs of services for 92 percent of the people who now receive Medicare. So the blanket statement that it would raise the cost for seniors is misleading. The fact that 8 percent might see higher costs does not support the DCCC’s blanket statement that health care costs will rise for seniors.

For younger Americans, there would still be a universal program that helps them pay for health care when they reach retirement age through payments to help buy private insurance. They would face higher out-of-pocket costs than those insured under the current plan.

The DCCC knows this but seems intent on scaring seniors. We rate its claim False. ",/factchecks/2011/jun/09/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-says-hurt-voted-again-end-medicare/

Rick Scott says welfare recipients are more likely to use illicit drugs
","Florida Gov. Rick Scott is defending his decision to sign a bill into law requiring drug tests for potential cash welfare recipients by saying that people who get welfare are more likely to be on drugs.

During an appearance on CNN on June 5, 2011, Scott was asked what evidence he had that people receiving welfare assistance in Florida are using drugs.

""Studies show that people that are on welfare are higher users of drugs than people not on welfare,"" Scott said. He started to continue his thought -- but was cut off by host T.J. Holmes. (You can watch the entire exchange by clicking here.)

""Sir, to that point ... that would stop people in their tracks. And I don't have whatever study you are referring to, but you're saying that people out there who need this assistance, lost jobs, are on welfare, have a higher tendency to use drugs,"" Holmes said.

""Absolutely,"" Scott responded. ""Studies show that people on welfare are using drugs much higher than other people in the population. But the bottom line is, if they're not using drugs, it's not an issue. Our taxpayers don't want to subsidize somebody's drug addiction. It's going to increase personal responsibility. It's the right thing to do for Floridians.""

Are cash welfare recipients more likely to be drug users than other Floridians?

Details about the drug-testing law

Scott had run for office promising a drug-testing requirement, and he worked to broaden the original drug-testing bill that would have applied only to recent drug felons. The final bill, HB 353, which Scott signed on May 31, forces all people who receive welfare cash -- called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families -- to pass a drug test in order to be eligible for the funds. If prospective recipients fail a first test, they would lose benefits for one year. A second positive drug test would make them ineligible for three years.

About 233,000 Floridians applied for cash assistance in 2009-10, according to statistics kept by the Department of Children and Families. During May 2011, 93,170 Floridians received cash assistance, a drop of 8.3 percent from a year ago. Payments can range from $100 to $200 a month per person.

Under the law -- which takes effect July 1 -- welfare applicants would have to pay for the test. If they pass, the state would reimburse them for the cost, which can range from $10 to $25.

Florida has tried to initiate drug testing before. The Legislature in 1998 approved a drug-testing pilot project for people receiving temporary cash assistance. But the results were underwhelming. Of the 8,797 applicants screened for drugs, only 335 (3.8 percent) showed evidence of having a controlled substance in their systems and failed the test, the Orlando Sentinel reported. The pilot project cost the state $2.7 million (or about $90 a test).

The Legislature ultimately abandoned the program.

Scott's case: Welfare recipients and drug use

Scott spokesman Lane Wright provided PolitiFact Florida with government and academic research that suggests people receiving government assistance are more likely to use illicit drugs than people who are not. The government analysis comes from the Department of Health and Human Services, which -- through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency -- conducts an annual National Survey on Drug Use & Health. (A lot of long names, sorry.) The survey has been conducted since 1971. Surveyors administer questions through face-to-face interviews at the subject's home. Results are based on tens of thousands of responses.

Government researchers used the 1999 and 2000 surveys to publish a report titled ""Substance Use Among Persons in Families Receiving Government Assistance.""

Among the findings, researchers concluded that ""past-month illicit drug use was higher in assisted families than in unassisted families among persons aged 12 to 64.""

Specifically, the report found that 9.6 percent of people in families receiving some type of government assistance reported recent drug use, compared to 6.8 percent among people in families receiving no government assistance at all. The government research, we should note, extends beyond the scope of what Scott is talking about -- cash payments through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program -- and includes families receiving food stamps, non-cash assistance through housing assistance or child care, and people receiving Medicaid.

It also is 11 years old.

But it does provide at least some grounding for Scott's claim.

We asked Bradford Stone, a government spokesman for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency, if researchers have used more recent survey data to complete the same analysis regarding drug use and welfare assistance. Stone said researchers have not.

The second report is from Harold Pollack, a professor at the University of Chicago who studies substance abuse among welfare recipients, and Lisa Metsch, a professor at the University of Miami.

The 2009 report, ""Substance Use Among Welfare Recipients: Trends and Policy Responses,"" concluded that ""substance abuse and dependence are relatively uncommon"" for people receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families dollars. Yet the same research found -- by reviewing many different surveys -- that ""approximately 20 percent of TANF recipients report that they have used an illicit drug at least once in the past year.""

In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Pollack said that his research helps support Scott's claim -- but it also doesn't.

""It is true that compared to other women of the same age, TANF recipients are more likely to use illicit substances,"" Pollack said. ""That's a fact.

""On the other hand, there are a couple of major caveats,"" Pollack added.

Pollack said that most women who have used an illicit drug in the past year do not meet the diagnosis of being dependent on drugs, or abusing drugs. A lot of casual marijuana users may well test positive, Pollack said, but they do not have a ""drug problem.""

Nor are they feeding a habit with welfare dollars, Pollack said.

The other case: Welfare recipients and drug use

The American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the drug-testing requirement, offered other government and academic research to consider.

Researchers at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a part of the National Institutes of Health, published findings in 1996 that said welfare recipients ""using, abusing, or dependent on alcohol or illicit drugs are consistent with proportions of both the adult U.S. population and adults who do not receive welfare.""

The research relied on 1992 data and concluded that drug use among welfare recipients ranged between 1.3 to 3.6 percent, compared to 1.5 percent for non-welfare recipients.

The caveats here are much like the government research Scott provided. Namely, it includes other types of welfare than cash assistance, and it's old. The report was published in 1996, and relies on 1992 data.

Another researcher used data from Michigan -- a state that participated in drug-testing for welfare recipients until the program was ruled unconstitutional. In Michigan, 10 percent of recipients tested positive for illicit drugs. That's comparable to The National Survey on Drug Use & Health, which found that in 2007-08, 8.95 percent of all Michigan residents (grouping non-welfare and welfare recipients) said they used illicit drugs in the last month.

Lastly, the ACLU highlighted the work of professors Robert Crew Jr. and Belinda Creel Davis, who studied Florida's attempt to drug test welfare recipients.

In two research papers, ""Substance Abuse as a Barrier to Employment of Welfare Recipients"" and ""Assessing the Effects of Substance Abuse Among Applicants for TANF Benefits: The Outcome of a Demonstration Project in Florida,"" Crew and Davis assessed the results of the Florida program.

They found that only 5 percent of welfare recipients showed evidence of drug abuse. But, Crew and Davis noted, the number is low in comparison to other data and raises ""some questions about the procedures employed by the state.""

Yet, Crew and Davis also concluded: ""The evidence from Florida suggests that the concern on the part of both citizens and public officials about substance abuse among welfare recipients may be unwarranted. Evidence from previous research on the welfare population in Florida shows that controlled substances are low (about 5 percent) when measured by a urine test.""

The study also concluded that welfare recipients who do use drugs are able to compete for jobs just like middle- and upper-class drug users -- meaning drug use isn't creating their reliance on welfare.

But Crew, who teaches at Florida State University, told us that his research didn't try to compare drug use among TANF recipients and non-TANF recipients.

""We didn't try to compare that population in Florida,"" he said. ""I don't know how to do that.""

Crew said his research had two major conclusions -- which we previously noted. The percentage of welfare recipients who used drugs in Florida was ""pretty small,"" and in terms of those recipients finding work, ""it didn't make much difference whether they used drugs or not.""

Our ruling

Let's remember what Scott said. He told CNN's T.J. Holmes that, ""Studies show that people that are on welfare are higher users of drugs than people not on welfare.""

Scott's office provided evidence that supports that claim. Sort of.

And opponents provided evidence that refutes Scott's claim. Sort of.

What's obvious is that it's difficult to make broad generalizations about a whole group of people. And it's even more difficult to definitively measure drug use. Scott's statement is at least partially accurate because there are studies showing a higher prevalence of drug use among some welfare recipients. But he also is neglecting research that suggests that drug use among welfare and non-welfare recipients is consistent.

"['Ohio', 'State Budget', 'Armond Budish']","
State Rep. Armond Budish says Kasich's budget amounts to Ohio's second largest spending increase
","
  
The irony behind Gov. John Kasich’s $55.6 billion two-year budget proposal is that a Republican leader who subscribes to the politics of limiting government spending is actually proposing to tap the state’s checkbook for a lot more cash than his Democratic predecessor ever did.

That’s a fact not lost on state Rep. Armond Budish, a Beachwood Democrat, who grabbed a  pen and paper last month to rail against The Columbus Dispatch’s endorsement of the governor’s proposal.

""Despite the dramatic cuts targeted at schools and local communities, Kasich’s budget increases state spending from $50.5 billion to $55.6 billion,"" Budish wrote in a letter the newspaper published May 14. ""This is the second largest, two-year spending increase in Ohio history.""

It is true that the governor’s budget makes deep cuts to public education and local governments, especially in larger urban areas. And it is true that the current state operating budget which covers fiscal years 2010 and 2011 passed under former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland and expires on June 30, made just $50.5 billion in appropriations. It marked the first time in more than four decades that an Ohio biennial budget actually spent less than the previous budget.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Budish’s numbers.

Ohio’s general revenue funds budget is part of a larger state fiscal document called an all funds budget. The general revenue fund is where state taxpayer money goes. It includes income, sales and other state taxes. The all funds budget, which is about double the general revenue fund, also includes money raised through various state licenses and fees and federal draw down funds for federally mandated spending and other items that lawmakers have little control over.

Budish’s numbers refer to the general revenue fund.

In another letter to The Dispatch, one written in response to Budish’s, state Rep. Ron Amstutz, a Wooster Republican, said the GRF accounts for less than half of total state spending.

Susan Ackerman, senior budget and fiscal analyst for the Center for Community Solutions, said that Amstutz is correct, but that Budish’s message is in better context. When thinking of the budget, the figure to focus on is the general revenue fund number, not the all funds figure, she said.

""I think the budget to really watch is the GRF budget. The GRF budget is funded by Ohio’s tax revenues and it is the budget that lawmakers have the most discretion over, therefor it gives you the most accurate picture of what the state’s priorities are,"" Ackerman said.

""The all funds budget is an important number, too,"" she said. ""But the problem in Ohio is there is a lot of double counting in our all funds budget.""

For example, state tax refunds are counted as expenditures in the all funds budget even though the state is essentially just giving back money that taxpayers overpaid, Ackerman said. And sales of state goods from one state entity to another is considered an appropriation under the all funds figure even though the money never technically left the state’s coffers.

""GRF is really where your tax dollars go,"" she said.

But is the spending level proposed by the governor is the second highest increase in the state’s history.

We started by asking where the House minority leader got his facts. Budish’s staff pointed us to a general revenue fund chart maintained on the Ohio Office of Budget and Management web site that lists the state’s operating budgets back to 1968. That’s just 43 years; not exactly inclusive of all Ohio history but enough information to test Budish’s point.

Kasich’s proposal represents a $5.1 billion spending increase for a state still limping back from a crippling economic recession and deficit somewhere between $4 billion and $8 billion. The largest spending increase since 1968 came under Republican Gov. Bob Taft. The 2000-01 budget, which spent $40.4 billion, was $5.3 billion greater than the previous budget.

We’re talking actual numbers here, not percentage gains or losses.

Since information prior to 1968 is difficult, at best, to completely recapture, PolitiFact Ohio wanted to add some perspective for the numbers that are available. The 1968-69 budget spent just $2.4 billion, so it appears safe to assume that never in Ohio’s history prior had the state witnessed a spending increase greater than $5.1 billion from one budget to the next. From that perspective, Budish’s statement seems logical.

Lawmakers and the public have traditionally focused on the general revenue fund because it is the figure that lawmakers have direct say so over how to spend.

Knowing that the GRF represents part of all state spending, and that the all funds budget is much larger, is an additional point that provides clarification.

And while Budish couldn’t provide documentation for his ""Ohio history"" reference, it is clear that Ohio has never passed a general revenue fund budget prior to 1968 that is anywhere in the stratosphere of what lawmakers are presently debating in the Statehouse.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Budish’s comment Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/09/armond-budish/state-rep-armond-budish-says-kasichs-budget-plan-c/

Social service provider says Rhode Island has highest rates of substance abuse in U.S.
","When state lawmakers this year took up legislation to create a high school program in Rhode Island for teens in recovery, they heard sobering testimony from the head of the agency that would run it.

Ian Lang, chief strategy officer of The Providence Center, a provider of mental-health and substance-abuse services, painted a disturbing portrait of addiction problems in Rhode Island.

""Rhode Island continues to have the highest rates of substance abuse in the country,"" he told members of the Senate Education Committee while describing plans to locate the small school in one wing of the center’s building on Hope Street.

Do we really have such a serious substance abuse problem?

In his remarks, Lang cited statistics from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Its sponsor, the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, says the survey  ""is the primary source of statistical information on the use of illegal drugs, alcohol, and tobacco by the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population aged 12 or older.""

The survey, begun in 1971, is conducted in door-to-door interviews with a representative sample of the nation’s population. About 900 people in Rhode Island respond annually to the questionnaire, parts of which are administered confidentially with computers.

Lang, citing survey estimates, testified that ""over 11 percent of Rhode Islanders 12 and over use illicit drugs, the highest rate in the nation, and that Rhode Island has the highest percentage of persons 12 years and over needing but not receiving treatment for illicit drug use, at 3.3 percent. We also have the lowest perceived risk of substance abuse in the country, according to national statistics.""

When we contacted Lang to discuss the survey results, he did some checking and realized he had actually cited old data. The most recent state-by-state comparison is based  on the 2007-2008 surveys. (The federal agency is a couple years behind and will release 2009 data later this year, a spokeswoman said.) Still, Lang said, Rhode Island continues to have among the worst substance-abuse rates in the nation.

""I think a lot of it has to do with the location... between Boston and New York and the easy availability of  drugs and the urban environment  we live in,"" he said. ""It’s a lot easier to get around here than if you were in the middle of nowhere....If you look at our sister states, it’s not just a problem in Rhode Island, it’s a problem in the Northeast,"" Lang said.

We decided to check the survey results ourselves. They turned out to be far more complex than we imagined. And troubling.

To begin with, states are not ranked individually. Instead, they are grouped into one of five ""quintiles."" So when Lang says Rhode Island’s rates are the ""highest"" in the nation, he’s using the survey definition, which is falling among the 10 worst states in any particular category.

We found that Rhode Island not only landed among the worst states in one category Lang cited -- the percentage of those 12 and over who have used illicit drugs in the past month -- we actually had the highest individual score. Rhode Island’s rate was 13.3 percent. (Oregon was second, at 12.1 percent.)

We wondered why Lang would select everyone 12 and over instead of focusing on the population that would be served by the recovery high school. The survey, after all, includes a category for youths ages 12 to 17. So how does Rhode Island rank in that category? Still in the highest fifth and, according to our review, second of all states, at 12.4 percent. (Vermont is highest, at 13 percent.)

Lang also cited survey estimates of how many people in Rhode Island need treatment for substance abuse, but aren’t getting it. For ages 12 and up, Rhode Island was in the ""highest"" group (ranking second at 3.9 percent). Again, we checked the rate for those ages 12 to 17, and the state remained in the top fifth, in sixth place at 4.9 percent.

Lang also highlighted the study’s examination of attitudes in Rhode Island toward drug use, namely whether people  consider monthly marijuana use and weekly binge drinking to be risky. The numbers generally indicate our state is more accepting than others of such behavior.

We decided to look into two areas of the survey that Lang didn’t mention, and turned up more troubling statistics. Turns out that Rhode Island topped all states for marijuana use for all age groups: an estimated 10.9 percent of residents 12 and older had used marijuana in the month prior to the survey. It also was tops for alcohol consumption by youth, including binge drinking.

Finally, we wondered whether the National Survey Lang cited is really the most authoritative. We put that question to Robert Morrison, executive director of the National Association of State Alcohol/Drug Abuse Directors.

""The national survey on drug use and health is one of the most widely used surveys in the country to get a picture of substance abuse in the nation,"" he told us.

In summary, the federal study Lang relied upon has a 40-year history and the statistics he cited were accurate. And when we delved into a variety of other categories from the same survey, we found that in many instances, Rhode Island has the ""highest rates of substance abuse in the country"" -- an alarming distinction.

We rate his claim True.
