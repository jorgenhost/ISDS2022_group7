Are coal mining jobs up by 50,000 since last year? Not exactly
","Just days after President Donald Trump announced that he would be pulling the United States out of the Paris international climate agreement, his Environmental Protection Agency administrator went on the Sunday shows to defend Trump’s decision. During the June 4 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd asked Scott Pruitt whether it was disingenuous for the administration to promise a rebirth of coal. On the one hand, coal is a high-carbon-emissions fuel that is at a disadvantage under the Paris agreement and could potentially benefit from the United States’ exit from the accord. On the other, some experts have said that the demise of coal as an energy source has less to do with emissions than with lost market share to a competing fossil fuel -- natural gas -- and technological improvements that have bolstered renewable energies such as wind and solar. Here’s how Pruitt answered Todd’s suggestion that the administration was making a ""false promise."" ""Dead wrong, because the numbers show exactly the opposite,"" Pruitt said. ""In fact, since the the fourth quarter of last year until most recently, we've added almost 50,000 jobs in the coal sector. In the month of May alone, almost 7,000 jobs."" Is that correct? Calculating job figures for the coal industry is tricky, as we have previously noted, but we found reason to be skeptical of Pruitt’s numbers. The EPA pointed us to a separate interview Pruitt had on ABC’s This Week, when he said, ""We've had over 50,000 jobs since last quarter -- coal jobs, mining jobs -- created in this country. We had almost 7,000 mining and coal jobs created in the month of May alone."" This is also not firmly backed by data. Let’s start with the official Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers. Currently, the BLS counts about 50,000 coal mining jobs in the United States -- total. That makes it all but impossible for the first half of Pruitt’s claim -- 50,000 more mining jobs since the end of last year -- to be accurate. Indeed, according to the BLS data, the actual increase in coal jobs since the end of last year was 1,300, while the monthly increase in May was 400. That’s far below the increases of 50,000 and 7,000 that Pruitt cited, respectively. Based on his comments to ABC, Pruitt appears to have been referring to the broader ""mining and logging"" sector in the BLS data. But even by that standard, his numbers are inflated. The mining and logging sector has grown by 38,000 jobs since the end of last year and grew by 6,000 in May. He’s close when he calls 6,000 ""almost 7,000,"" but 38,000 is well short of 50,000. And if Pruitt meant to refer to these statistics, they include logging jobs as well -- a sector he didn’t reference on the shows. The coal industry has long chafed at the BLS’ definition of coal-sector jobs. Terry Headley, the director of communications for the American Coal Council, said that coal employment numbers compiled independently by states are typically much larger than what BLS has found, perhaps because many states use broader definitions of who should be counted. For instance, Headley said, coal truck drivers -- probably numbering several thousand nationally -- are not broken out from the BLS data for ""truck drivers."" The situation is similar for electricians, surveyors, mechanics, and equipment service technicians, he said. In West Virginia alone, he said, state data for 2015 show 48,327 in the category of miners, mine support, and onsite processing staff. ""If you look purely at the federal numbers you will only get about 12,000 for the state,"" he said. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, doesn’t dispute that this can have an effect on the numbers. ""It’s possible that the added employment connected with moving the coal once it is removed from the ground, such as transportation and warehousing, and the use of the coal in downstream industries, such as in electric power generation and integrated steel plants, would produce a somewhat bigger employment effect,"" Burtless said. Official BLS data for the coal mining industry ""does omit many workers who work in the industry,"" said Jed Kolko, the chief economist for the jobs site Indeed.com. ""Related industries, like support activities for mining, presumably include some who work in the coal mining industry, though related industries might combine coal with oil and gas and therefore make it hard to come up with a broader total of coal-mining employees."" Still, Burtless said that getting from 1,300 official coal-mining jobs to 50,000 additional jobs that can be credited to the sector would likely require an even more generous definition -- one that estimates how many additional jobs in the overall economy stem from the added purchasing by newly flush coal companies and miners. Headley said that such calculations for the coal sector have historically ranged from a multiplier of three to a multiplier of 11 -- that is, from three times to 11 times as many jobs created in the broader economy for every job created in coal mining. Such a wide range of estimates should serve as a yellow light, economists say, since they are subject to advocates’ rosy estimates. Pruitt is at least able to point to data showing a recent increase in coal production. Data calculated by the federal Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration shows that year-to-date coal production has been 17.6 percent higher than the comparable figure for 2016. And data from the Association of American Railroads shows that, the amount of coal loaded onto rail cars has been significantly higher so far this year than it was during first few months of 2016. Such data indicates that more coal has been mined and shipped in the first part of this year, even if actual job gains aren’t showing up in the data yet. Still, this begs the question of whether this increase had anything to do with the Trump administration’s policies. The increase in coal jobs began before Trump was elected. The job gains in the coal sector during the final five months of the Barack Obama administration -- an administration that Trump’s camp blamed for waging a ""war on coal"" -- were actually slightly larger than the equivalent number for the first five months of the Trump administration, namely 1,400 versus 1,300. Moreover, good and bad times in the coal sector tend to stem more from industry-specific developments and international factors than domestic policy changes, experts said. ""Coal mining is a highly cyclical industry, making it hard to attribute ups and down to policy or political factors,"" Kolko said. A recent report in NPR put its finger on one possible factor that has boosted the coal sector in recent months -- unusually high demand for ""metallurgical"" coal, which is used for making steel, rather than for electricity generation. Metallurgical coal accounts for about about one-sixth of coal production worldwide. Art Sullivan, a mining consultant and former coal miner in Washington, Pa., told NPR that Australia, the world’s leader in metallurgical coal, has faced supply-chain troubles in recent months due to rail and weather problems. This, plus higher Chinese steel production, has caused the price for Australian metallurgical steel to spike, making U.S. firms more competitive recently than they would ordinarily have been, Sullivan told NPR. Pruitt said, ""Since the fourth quarter of last year until most recently, we've added almost 50,000 jobs in the coal sector. In the month of May alone, almost 7,000 jobs."" The official Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows strikingly smaller increases than what Pruitt said, even when taking into account his comments on other Sunday shows. Meanwhile, there is evidence that coal production and shipment is higher this year compared to early 2016, but the rise actually began under Obama and it’s not clear that Trump policies have been the driving factor. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/jun/05/scott-pruitt/are-coal-mining-jobs-50000-last-year-not-exactly/

Al Gore says a majority of Trump voters support Paris Agreement. Really?
","Former Vice President Al Gore said most backers of President Donald Trump wanted the United States to remain a party to the Paris accord on climate change. Trump announced on June 1 that he would set the country on a course to withdraw from the agreement, which lays out ambitious but voluntary goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature. ""The president made the wrong decision in my view and in the view of most Americans,"" Gore said in a June 4 interview on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos. ""A majority of President Trump's supporters and voters wanted us to stay in."" Gore made it sound like the president’s decision was out of step with his supporters, so we decided to take a closer look at how his voters view the global climate pact. Gore, an environmentalist who favored sticking to the deal, appears to be referring to a joint poll conducted by Yale University and George Mason University immediately after the 2016 election that looked at what American voters -- and Trump voters in particular -- thought about U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement. (It is the only poll we could find that homed in on Trump voters’ position on the Paris deal.) Overall, the poll found that nearly 70 percent of registered voters wanted the United States to stay in the international agreement that’s been signed by 194 other countries. That appears to dovetail with a separate Rasmussen poll of likely voters that found only 30 percent agreed with Trump’s decision to withdraw. The Yale-GMU poll also found that a slim majority of registered Republicans -- 51 percent -- said the United States should participate in the pact. However, this result fell within the 3 percent margin of error, so it should not be taken as an ironclad indication of majority support. As for Trump voters, the poll describes their attitudes about the environment in a light that may strike some as a surprising, given Trump’s previous dismissal of climate change as a ""hoax."" Most Trump voters who responded to the poll voiced support for some climate-friendly policies. Strikingly, nearly half backed an Obama administration policy limiting carbon emissions from coal-powered plants, as well as a carbon tax on fossil fuel companies. On Gore’s central point, the poll found that among Trump voters, 47 percent wanted to participate in the Paris Agreement, compared to 28 percent who supported opting out, with a quarter expressing no opinion. So, 47 percent support among Trump voters amounts to a plurality -- not a majority, as Gore said. This may seem nitpicky, but had Gore said that more Trump voters wanted to remain in the agreement than leave it, his description of the Yale-GMU poll would have been accurate. Since this is the only poll we found that asked Trump voters specifically about U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement, we wondered how much credence we should give the data. For insight on the Yale-GMU poll’s reliability, we turned to polling experts Karlyn Bowman of the American Enterprise Institute and Charles Franklin, who directs the Marquette Law School Poll. Both agreed Yale-GMU’s polling generally employs sound statistical methods and is considered highly reputable in the field. Bowman said there’s no sign that the poll’s funding sources, including the Energy Foundation, swayed the pollsters’ findings. Our experts also agreed that the 401 self-identified Trump voters who responded to the poll amounted to an adequate sampling, and that the poll’s roughly 5 percent margin of error was a fair estimate. But we got some interesting answers when we asked our experts to consider the Yale-GMU question that elicited the relevant data, which read: ""One year ago, the United States signed an international agreement in Paris with 196 other countries to limit the pollution that causes global warming. Do you think the U.S. should participate in this agreement, or not participate?"" Franklin said there’s no issue with question phrasing, per se. But given his belief that most people don’t know the details of the Paris Agreement, Franklin said the opinion may be ""more of a reflection of a general attitude toward and belief about climate change."" That’s important because, as Gallup points out, Americans are open to arguments about helping the environment and containing global warming, on the one hand, and arguments about the costs of imposing burdens on the U.S. economy that might slow job growth, increase federal spending or lead to unfair outcomes for the United States, on the other. However, what the Yale-GMU question did not do was challenge respondents to wrestle with these trade-offs, which is the core of any meaningful environmental policy, including the Paris Agreement. Had the question addressed this tension, the findings may have been quite different. By failing to address the costs of participation, the Yale-GMU question may very well have been interpreted to mean, ""Do you dislike pollution and like working with other countries?"" Bowman said that given how low climate change ranks on Americans’ priority list it’s unlikely that subsequent polls will show Trump voters emerging as strong environmentalists. What’s more likely, she said, is that future polling on climate change would break along partisan lines. Franklin agreed that forthcoming polls will provide important context. ""This is one poll taken shortly after the election,"" he said. ""Now that Trump has acted on this, will those numbers shift?"" Gore said, ""A majority of President Trump's supporters and voters wanted us to stay in"" the Paris Agreement. One poll taken immediately after the 2016 election found 47 percent of Trump voters supported U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement that Trump withdrew from. That amounts to a plurality, not a majority. While our experts lauded Yale-GMU's statistical methodology and reputation, the poll question skirted the tension inherent in policymaking. A more meaningful question about whether or not to participate in the Paris Agreement would force respondents to wrestle with environmental and economic trade-offs. Ultimately, it's risky hanging a factual assertion on any one single poll, and a fuller, more accurate picture of Trump supporters' opinion of environmental policy is likely to emerge through additional polling over time. We rate Gore’s statement Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2017/jun/05/al-gore/al-gore-says-majority-trump-voters-support-paris-a/

City of Austin appointee says Arabic third most-common language in Texas capital
","An Austin appointee declared Arabic the Texas capital’s third most-common language. De veras? Maram Museitif, confirmed by the Austin City Council in May 2017 to serve until 2020 on the Central Health Board of Managers, was quoted saying in a press release announcing the appointment: ""I'm very familiar with Central Health's mission and the needs of the people we serve. I bring a broader representation to the board."" Museitif went on: ""Austin has a growing Muslim, Arab, and refugee community and they need a voice at the table. I can be that voice. I'm a Muslim and speak fluent Arabic, which is the third most-common language in Austin."" That’s not so for all of Austin, we found, but it has been so among patients seeking care at clinics overseen by Central Health. For all of Texas, we previously found True a 2016 claim by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, that Vietnamese is the state’s third most-spoken language. Cornyn’s statement was backed up by U.S. Census Bureau survey results. Those results placed Arabic about No. 10 in the state. Spokesman: Appointee meant to limit claim Ted Burton, a Central Health spokesman, responded to our request for the basis of Museitif’s statement by saying she meant to say something less. ""Museitif,"" Burton wrote, ""was referring to CommUnityCare’s patient population – meaning patients in our community that Central Health serves."" He said the online press release quoting Museitif would be amended to quote her calling Arabic ""the third most common language in the CommUnityCare patient population."" Central Health says it works through a network of health care partners and community members to connect uninsured, underinsured and low-income residents with high-quality, cost-effective health care. Its all-volunteer board consists of four members appointed by the council, four by the Travis County Commissioners Court — plus one joint appointee Burton wrote that in fiscal 2015, a little over half of the entity’s patients spoke English, nearly 44 percent spoke Spanish--and, third in concentration, 1.1 percent reported speaking Arabic, according to self-reported patient data. In the year, Burton said, about 20 clinics served more than 88,000 patients. Burton provided a chart breaking out patients’ ""language"" responses: Top 10 Languages spoken by CUC patients, FY15 (excluding unknown or other) Language % 1 English 51.9% 2 Spanish 43.5% 3 Arabic 1.1% 4 Burmese 0.4% 5 Nepali 0.4% 6 Vietnamese 0.3% 7 Persian 0.2% 8 American Sign Language 0.2% 9 Swahili 0.1% 10 Amharic 0.1% Total 98.1% SOURCE: Email citing patient-submitted responses, Ted Burton, director of communications, Central Health, May 26, 2017 Burton, asked for more detail, emailed us a document showing that Arabic also proved to be CommUnityCare patients’ third most-common language in 2014 and 2016. Asked why Arabic has been so widely used among patients, Burton put us in touch with an Arabic-speaking CommUnityCare physician assistant, Amneh Amro, who speculated by phone that there’d been an Austin-area uptick in refugees from Arabic-speaking countries including Syria. A decade earlier, Amro said, Asian languages were likely more prevalent among patients. When we asked, Burton said Central Health has no data on patients' countries of origin. Surveys: Chinese third most-common Austin language So, which languages are most prevalent in Austin? We heard back from a couple of authorities on that. Jewel Jordan, a Census Bureau spokeswoman, pointed out results from the single-year 2015 American Community Survey indicating that behind English and Spanish, the third most common spoken language in Austin was Chinese. According to those survey results, Arabic was Austin’s 12th most-common spoken language — though we noticed that if you apply the survey’s margin of error figures as much as possible to drive up the number of Austin Arabic speakers and apply respective margins of error to drive down the number of speakers of some other languages, it’s possible to place Arabic fifth in the city, behind English, Spanish, Chinese and ""Other Asian Languages."" Ryan Robinson, the City of Austin demographer, drew on the bureau’s five-year ACS results through 2015 to provide a chart showing Arabic 10th in prevalence among spoken languages in Austin behind English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, other Asian languages, Korean, Hindi, French and other Indic languages. The chart also presents estimates of the number of individuals primarily speaking about 30 other languages. Our ruling Museitif called Arabic Austin’s third most-common language. That’s incorrect; in 2015, Chinese ranked third in prevalence in Austin behind English and Spanish, according to federal surveys. Arabic was evidently third most common among languages spoken by patients at clinics overseen by Central Health. We rate Museitif’s statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Donald Trump's tweet misleads about London mayor's reaction to bridge, stabbing attacks
","Saturday night, President Donald Trump responded to the London Bridge and market attacks with solidarity for London and the United Kingdom. Sunday morning, Trump had harsh words for the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan. ""At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’ "" Trump wrote June 4. At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ""no reason to be alarmed!"" The London mayor did use those words in a morning-after news conference about the van and stabbing rampage. But in no way, shape or form did Khan say them about the terrorist attack. When Khan said there was ""no reason to be alarmed,"" he was talking about the increased police presence around the city that residents and tourists would notice. Khan condemned the attacks at London Bridge and Borough Market. ""I am appalled and furious that these cowardly terrorists would deliberately target innocent Londoners and bystanders enjoying their Saturday night,"" Khan said June 4. ""There can be no justification for the acts of these terrorists. And I’m quite clear that we will never let them win nor will we allow them to cower our city or Londoners."" Khan talked about the stepped-up police presence three different times in the news conference, and twice he said people should not be alarmed by it. Here's one of the comments in context, via the BBC: ""Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. ""No reason to be alarmed. One of the things the police and all of us need to do is make sure we're as safe as we possibly can be. ""I'm reassured that we are one of the safest global cities in the world, if not the safest global city in the world, but we always evolve and review ways to make sure that we remain as safe as we possibly can."" The comment came up again when Khan was asked to give his message to Londoners and visitors (go to the 6:50 mark). In addition to saying they should remain calm and vigilant, he said, ""You will see an increased police presence today, including armed officers, uniformed officers. There's no reason to be alarmed by this. We are the safest global city in the world."" At another point in the news conference, Khan said he did not want the general elections Thursday postponed as a result of the attacks, and the threat level remained ""severe."" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It’s probable that Trump fired off his tweets after watching Fox & Friends, where pundits discussed Khan’s comments in the same manner around the same time. Asked about Trump’s tweet, a spokesperson for Khan told NBC News, ""The mayor is busy working with the police, emergency services, and the government to coordinate the response to this horrific and cowardly terrorist attack and provide leadership and reassurance to Londoners and visitors to our city. He has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump's ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks urging Londoners not to be alarmed when they saw more police — including armed officers — on the streets."" Trump tweeted, ""At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’ "" Trump portrayed Khan as an official with his head in the sand about the attacks that disrupted his city. The reality is the president plucked five words from the mayor’s longer message that condemned the terrorist acts and explained why Londoners would see an increased police presence in the coming days. Khan was not saying there is ""no reason to be alarmed,"" period,  by the attack -- he was pre-empting concerns about what law enforcement presence might mean in the days to come.  We rate Trump’s statement False.",/factchecks/2017/jun/04/donald-trump/donald-trumps-tweet-misleads-about-london-mayors-r/

Do California’s clean energy jobs equal 10 times the nation’s coal mining jobs?
","Democrats in California vowed to take on greater leadership on climate change this week after President Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris Climate Accord. The day before Trump’s action, State Senate Leader Kevin de León, a Democrat from Los Angeles, said California should sprint ahead on aggressive renewable energy goals not only to fight climate change but because it makes economic sense. ""We have already seen the economic benefits,"" of clean energy policies, De León told his colleagues on the Senate floor on May 31, 2017. ""Today, California is home to over 100,000 solar jobs."" He made his comments as he promoted a plan to require California produce all of its energy from renewable sources by 2045. De León then made a related claim that caught our attention: ""Clean energy is in fact a pillar of our economy that employs now more than half a million Californians. That’s nearly ten times more the number of coal mining jobs that exist in the entire nation. So, clean energy is the future.""  De León makes his claim at about the 2:30 minute mark in the video above.  We know California is home to many jobs tied to solar, wind and other renewable forms of energy. But do those really amount to nearly ten times the number of coal mining jobs nationwide? We dug in on a fact check. Coal mining jobs We’ll start by examining the number of coal mining jobs. As of May 2017, there were 51,000 coal mining jobs nationwide, according to an analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  This includes all categories of workers in the industry, from clerks and accountants to truck drivers and security guards. The number of extraction workers -- those who actually mine the coal -- was far smaller, at 11,620, according to 2016 breakdown of these jobs by the Bureau. In the mid 1980s, there were nearly 180,000 coal mining jobs in the United States. The industry has experienced a steady decline in employment since that time, with a few exceptions. De León appears to be on the right track with his claim that California’s half million clean energy jobs are nearly ten times the nation’s 51,000 coal mining jobs. Clean energy jobs Verifying the number of clean energy jobs in California is more complex. ""There isn’t a formal way the state collects data on clean energy jobs, at least not at this point,"" said Brook Taylor, deputy director of the California Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development. Instead, Taylor said, the state relies on a survey by Advanced Energy Economy Institute, which is affiliated with a national association that promotes clean and affordable energy. He said the organization takes a deep look at California’s ""advanced energy"" jobs, which Taylor described as an interchangeable term for clean energy employment. As of 2015, AEEI’s survey found 507,703 advanced energy jobs in California, up 18 percent from the previous year. It estimated that figure would grow to nearly 550,000 in 2016. AEEI said it based its data on a survey of 831 companies doing business in California. It defines advanced energy employees are those who are full-time and part-time permanent employees who support the advanced energy portion of a business, including administrative staff and excluding interns and other temporary workers. De León's spokesman pointed to this survey as evidence for the senator’s claim. ‘Really elusive number’ Labor economists, however, say the AEE survey isn’t perfect. ""This is a really elusive number,"" Carol Zabin, director of the Green Economy Program at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, said of the number of clean energy jobs in the state. ""The study he cited by AEE, it may be an exaggeration. But we don’t have anything better."" Zabin said the way clean energy jobs are counted is problematic. An electrician whose company starts installing more efficient lighting, she explained, might be counted as having a clean energy job. A bus driver who operates a diesel bus one year and then a cleaner burning bus the next might similarly be counted in the survey as having a clean energy job. But those aren’t new jobs, they are the ""greening of jobs,"" she added. The survey also might count employees who spend only part of their time performing clean energy tasks as clean energy workers, added Betony Jones, associate director at the university’s Green Economy Program. De León's statement does not specifically address whether these are new jobs or existing positions that have shifted to clean energy roles. The senator’s spokesman also pointed to a 2017 U.S. Energy and Employment report that at least partly backs up the claim. That report cites just over 300,000 energy efficiency jobs in the state. In addition, the report includes 200,000 electric power generation jobs, of which about 153,000 belong to the solar industry and about 4,600 in wind. This approaches the half million jobs De Leon cited, though many of them would be subject to the same caveats expressed by the labor economists. Our rating State Senator Kevin de León recently stated that California has ""more than half a million"" clean energy jobs. ""That’s nearly ten times more the number of coal mining jobs that exist in the entire nation."" Government data and a survey by the Advanced Energy Economy Institute, which is affiliated with a clean energy trade group, largely back up De León's claim. Labor economists say pinpointing the exact number of clean energy jobs in any state is difficult. There aren’t always clear definitions for these jobs. And the way some clean energy jobs are counted is problematic, they said, because some positions only focus on clean energy as a portion of their overall responsibilties. Still, they said, the evidence cited by the senator is the best available. We found De León's statement is accurate but needs clarification.

State money was not used to buy beer tanks for Genesee Brewery
","A dozen massive fermentation tanks slowly traveled on barges along a 225-mile stretch of the Erie Canal before reaching Rochester last week. It was an eye-catching site for the thousands who flocked to the canal to watch the tanks float by. The 2,000-barrel tanks were hauled from Saratoga County to Rochester as part of Genesee Brewery’s $49 million upgrade. But their arrival also drew criticism from Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi, a Democrat from Utica, because the state offered economic incentives to the brewery even though the tanks were made in China. ""It disgusts me to know that state economic development dollars were used to support a project where goods were manufactured in China, when we have companies like Feldmeier Equipment that produce products like this right in the Mohawk Valley,"" Brindisi said in a statement. ""New York should put its money where its mouth is and support our state workers and state companies first, before they ship taxpayers' money right out the door to China."" Is Brindisi right? Were tax dollars used to pay a manufacturer in China for the new fermentation tanks at Genesee Brewery? State money In September 2016, New York state officials announced a $9.5 million investment to support the expansion at Genesee Brewery. The state promised help from two programs: $4.5 million in tax credits from the Excelsior Jobs Program and up to $5 million from the governor’s Upstate Revitalization Initiative. But Genesee Brewery has not yet received any of that money from the state. The company must first meet criteria from the Empire State Development. The brewery must create 128 full-time positions by 2020 to qualify for the $4.5 million in tax credits. Half of those jobs have to go to local residents in poverty based on criteria from the Rochester-Monroe Anti-Poverty Initiative. The tax credits are spread out over ten years. The $5 million from the Upstate Revitalization Initiative has strings attached, too. The brewery must invest $34 million in private money and create 13 full-time positions to receive the first $2 million of the grant. The other $3 million would be paid in four installments if the brewery maintains its hiring goals and consistently pays its property taxes. Private money The tanks are part of a three-phase upgrade at Genesee Brewery. The state incentives could reach $9.5 million. Genesee Brewery’s corporate parent, North American Breweries, is spending $40 million. The approximate cost of the tanks accounts for about 5 percent of the company's $40 million investment, the company said. The brewery says its parent company paid for the tanks. The state also confirmed no state money was used. ""The bottom line is that while Feldmeier bid on a larger equipment package, the company declined (twice) to bid on the tanks in question and not one penny of State funds were spent on the equipment purchased by NAB, from China or elsewhere,"" Jason Conwall, an Empire State Development spokesman, said in a statement. A request for bids on the tanks went out in December 2015, the same month the Finger Lakes region was awarded $500 million in economic development money from the governor’s Upstate Revitalization Initiative competition. The brewery’s expansion was included in the region’s pitch for the award but no dollar amount was announced until September 2016. Genesee Brewery signed a contract with Chinese manufacturer Lehui in June 2016 to begin the first phase of the project, a modernization of the brewery’s equipment. Genesee Brewery has worked with Feldmeier Equipment since at least 2006 to manufacture equipment for the plant, including seven tanks in the last three years. When the bid for new fermentation tanks went out, Feldmeier put in a bid for a large part of the project instead of the whole project. ""Based on the timing for the project at the time, we placed a bid on the majority of it but not the entire project, just because of the timing,"" said Dave Pollock, vice president of sales for Feldmeier Equipment.

Austin's Ann Hudspeth says Texas leads nation in animal deaths due to exploding M-44 traps
","A toxic bomb that kills wild animals and sometimes even pets should be banned, an Austin resident urged in a letter to the editor of the Austin American-Statesman. Ann Hudspeth stirred our curiosity by writing: ""Fourteen states are using cyanide bombs to kill wildlife — and Texas leads the country in animal deaths by sodium cyanide M-44s."" Her April 2017 letter continued: ""Thousands of coyotes, foxes, possums, raccoons and skunks meet their end this way in our state. According to figures from the Humane Society of the United States, last year seven Texas dogs were killed by these bombs."" She closed her letter by advocating for a proposed national ban on sodium cyanide M-44s, pointing out legislation introduced in March 2017 by U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., to ban the use of sodium cyanide and another compound for predator control. A 2010 U.S. Department of Agriculture leaflet, from its Animal Health and Plant Inspection Service, calls sodium cyanide M-44s, which are placed with the permission of ranchers and landowners by the agency’s Wildlife Services branch,  ""an effective and environmentally sound wildlife damage management tool."" The leaflet specifies how it works: ""The spring-activated device delivers a dose of cyanide powder to targeted animals,"" who draw the poison into their mouths by tugging on baited capsule holders. According to a 2012 Sacramento Bee news series, the service’s roots reach to 1915, when Congress – hoping to increase beef production for World War I – allocated $125,000 to exterminate wolves, starting in Nevada. ""Popular among ranchers, the effort was expanded in 1931 when President Herbert Hoover signed a law authorizing the creation of a government agency – later named the Branch of Predator and Rodent Control – ‘to promulgate the best methods of eradication, suppression or bringing under control’ a wide range of wildlife from mountain lions to prairie dogs,"" the Bee reported. Reader cites society research Hudspeth, describing herself as a Congressional District 10 Texas volunteer with the Humane Society of the United States, told us by email that she based the claim on a humane society ""data sheet."" The undated sheet, which she provided, has a chart indicating that in 2016, Texas ranked first among 14 states with 4,865 animals killed by sodium cyanide M-44s. According to the sheet, the animals felled in Texas included 4,210 coyotes, 521 gray foxes, 56 red foxes, 40 raccoons, 25 opossums, 7 dogs and 6 skunks. Oklahoma placed second, per the sheet, with 3,930 such animal deaths, with New Mexico third at 901 such deaths:                      SOURCE: Document, ""Wildlife Services, M-44 Data  by Species and State,"" 2016, the Human Society of the United States, undated (received by email from Ann Hudspeth, Austin, April 28, 2017 and confirmed by email, Wendy Keefover, carnivore protection manager, Wildlife Department, the Humane Society of the United States, April 30, 2017) We spot-checked and confirmed the society’s presented totals for the top three declared states from USDA-posted data. By email, we heard back from a service spokesman, Andre Bell, that the death counts by state are annually updated. Rates of animal deaths We recognized, too, that Texas was by far the most populous of the states with M-44 deaths. When we adjusted for population differences, using U.S. Census Bureau estimates, we found Oklahoma leading the 14 states with 10 such animal deaths for every 10,000 residents. By this metric, Texas ranked No. 8, with nearly 2 such deaths per 10,000 residents--higher than the rates for Nevada, Virginia, Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Colorado and lower than the rates for Oklahoma, North Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, West Virginia and Nebraska. We also tried ranking the deaths by state by adjusting for each state’s total area in square miles as posted by the bureau. By this sort, West Virginia had the highest rate of M-44 animal deaths per square mile--with Texas second, followed by Nebraska, North Dakota, Virginia, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Human exposures Hudspeth put us in touch with Wendy Keefover, a manager for the Humane Society of the United States, who guided us to news accounts of human and pet dog exposures to the sodium cyanide explosives intended to kill predators. A 1971 Sports Illustrated story described the 1966 death of Texas surveyor Raymond Medford, 49, near Fort Stockton due to accidental sodium cyanide exposure from a predecessor predator-control device to the M-44. Keefover wrote that through a Freedom of Information Act request to the Environmental Protection Agency, the society drew reports of four other Texans exposed to sodium cyanide, none fatally, all in connection with M-44s, from 1998 into 2011. Keefover also noted an April 20, 2017, National Geographic news story stating that according to the EPA, ""an average of 30,000 M-44s, deployed by the federal government in concert with Western states and counties, are triggered each year. Baited to entice animals, they’re indiscriminate in their victims,"" the story said. Also noted: Wildlife Services reporting that in 2016, 12,511 of 76,963 coyotes killed for livestock protection were felled with M-44s. Most recently, Keefover noted, a March 2017 incident resulted in a boy and his dog briefly getting exposed to an M-44’s contents. According to an Idaho State Journal news story noted by the fact-checkers at Snopes.com, 14-year-old Canyon Mansfield was walking with his dog when he noticed what he thought was a sprinkler head protruding 6 inches from the ground. ""Like many curious teenagers would, he bent down and touched the pipe, which erupted with a loud popping noise that knocked Canyon off his feet,"" the story said. ""A hissing sound ensued and Canyon noticed his clothing and face were covered with an orange, powdery substance,"" the story said, which the boy washed off in nearby snow; his dog, though, shortly died. The story said Wildlife Services issued a statement referring to the dog’s death as a regretted ""unintentional lethal take."" Humane Society stands by claim Reminded that Texas falls far short of No. 1 in animal deaths due to M-44s once the federal counts are adjusted for each state’s population, a national Humane Society official, Carol Misseldine, replied by email that Hudspeth and the society intended a different emphasis. ""Texas ranks number one in total numbers of animals killed by these cyanide bombs and we stand by our numbers,"" Misseldine wrote. Our ruling Hudspeth wrote: ""Texas leads the country in animal deaths by sodium cyanide M-44s."" Texas would have ranked lower if each state’s tally were adjusted for population or land area, but Hudspeth’s claim was only that Texas had more animal deaths than any other. We rate her claim True.

Did Obama seek back-channel talks with Iran during his 2008 campaign?
","Amid media reports that President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner sought secret ""back-channel"" communications with Russia before Trump’s inauguration, some conservative commentators say outraged liberals have a short memory. They say Barack Obama did pretty much the same thing during the 2008 presidential campaign, secretly sending former Ambassador to Ukraine William Miller to Iran. Like Kushner, they say, Obama went around the existing administration to forge his own diplomatic path with a foreign adversary. ""Let me set the scene for you. It's 2008, we are having an election, and candidate Obama, he's not even president-elect, sends William Miller over to Iran to establish a back channel and let the Iranians know that should he win the election, they will have friendlier terms,"" Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel said on NBC’s Meet the Press on May 28. Candidate Obama faced criticism for saying he would talk to Iranian leaders as president. And after he took office, his administration pursued back-channel communications — meaning secret dialogue outside normal diplomatic processes — with Iran as part of achieving the nuclear deal. Journalists reported on those processes extensively. We were intrigued by the claim that Obama sought secret communication channels with Iran before he even won the 2008 election. When we started to dig into it, we were surprised to find that the evidence supporting that narrative is slim and ultimately insufficient. As far as we can tell, this allegation stems solely from the commentary of Michael Ledeen, a conservative Iran and Iraq expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a critic of Obama’s foreign policy. Ledeen was also a national security consultant to President Ronald Reagan’s administration. He recently co-authored a book with Trump’s ousted National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies. Strassel hasn’t replied to our requests for comment, but she defended her comment on Twitter by citing Ledeen’s work. By Ledeen’s account, Miller told him that Obama sent him to Tehran in 2008. Ledeen has made this claim a number of times since at least 2013, in blog posts, on conservative talk radio, on Twitter in prepared remarks, and in a phone interview with PolitiFact June 1. ""During his first presidential campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama used a secret back channel to Tehran to assure the mullahs that he was a friend of the Islamic Republic, and that they would be very happy with his policies,"" Ledeen wrote in 2014 for conservative website PJ Media. ""The secret channel was Ambassador William G. Miller, who served in Iran during the shah's rule, as chief of staff for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and as ambassador to Ukraine. Ambassador Miller has confirmed to me his conversations with Iranian leaders during the 2008 campaign."" We called up Miller. He said Ledeen’s claims are ""totally untrue."" Miller told us that he supported Obama’s 2008 candidacy and knew some of the campaign’s foreign policy staff from his decades-long public service career, but he had no role in the campaign or the subsequent administration. Miller does have extensive experience with Iran, starting out as a diplomat there in the 1950s and 1960s. President Jimmy Carter chose Miller to be a lead negotiator during the 1979 hostage crisis, while Miller was serving as staff director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. And as a private citizen, he played a role in the release of American hikers who were imprisoned in Iran from 2009-11. But ""the assertion that Obama sent me as an envoy is totally false,"" he said, adding that he’s met Ledeen a few times but doesn’t really know him. Miller said he travels frequently to Iran but didn’t in 2008. When we told Ledeen that Miller was telling a different story, Ledeen stood by his account. ""(Miller has) changed his mind,"" Ledeen said. ""He’s decided he didn’t go to Tehran."" So either Ledeen or Miller isn’t telling the truth. We’re sensitive to the idea that someone who was involved in secret communications might not be forthcoming with us about those communications. But it’s also telling that there have been no independent news reports to corroborate Ledeen’s claims, given the extensive reporting on the Obama administration’s relations with Iran and negotiations over the nuclear deal. Marie Harf, who headed the State Department’s Iran nuclear negotiations communications strategy during Obama’s second term, said she hadn’t heard of these allegations until we called her. ""Never in my time at the State Department or working on Iran negotiations did any back channel prior to when we were in office come up,"" she said. Wall Street Journal foreign affairs reporter Jay Solomon, author of The Iran Wars, said he ""could never prove"" that Obama sought a back channel to Iran as a presidential candidate, but he can’t definitively say it didn’t happen. Like Solomon, National Iranian American Council President Trita Parsi never came across any evidence for the alleged back channel while researching either of his two books about the Obama administration’s relationship with Iran, including the upcoming Losing an Enemy: Obama, Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy. Parsi questioned Ledeen’s credibility and said, ""At this point, I'm completely convinced this is all B.S."" Strassel said that in 2008, Obama’s presidential campaign secretly sent former Ambassador William Miller to Iran to talk with Iranian leaders. This is a case of he-said-she-said. A single conservative scholar says Miller told him about his secret ‘08 campaign mission to Iran. Independent journalists who have covered U.S.-Iran relations extensively haven’t been able to confirm the account. There is no corroborating evidence, and Miller says it’s not true; he says he never worked on behalf of the Obama campaign, and he didn’t travel to Iran in 2008. At PolitiFact, we believe the burden is on the speaker to back up their claim with evidence. The evidence here is insufficient, so we rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2017/jun/02/kimberley-strassel/did-obama-seek-back-channel-talks-iran-during-his-/

Richest 1 percent pay lowest rate of state and local taxes in Wisconsin?
","Two weeks after indicating he will run for governor of Wisconsin in 2018, the leader of a nonprofit organization that encourages citizens to challenge the political establishment listed some of the reasons why. The potential candidate is Mike McCabe, who runs Blue Jean Nation and was a founding member of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks money in politics. Appearing on the May 21, 2017 edition of ""Capital City Sunday,"" a public affairs show on WKOW-TV in Madison, McCabe said the state needs to raise the minimum wage ""to turn that into a living wage"" and make education ""debt free."" He added: ""And we’ve got to change a tax system -- when you look at all the state and local taxes we pay in Wisconsin, the wealthiest 1 percent pay the lowest overall tax rate."" Claims about the 1 percent, or the richest of the rich, are among our most popular. Let’s see how this one stands up. His evidence

McCabe, who says he is not a member of any political party, cited a 50-state analysis of state and local taxes published in January 2015 by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning research organization based in Washington, D.C. Experts told us it is the only recent report of its kind on state and local taxes in Wisconsin. The report measured total state and local taxes as a share of family income for non-elderly taxpayers. In Wisconsin, according to the report, the top 1 percent pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than other income groups: Lowest 20%: Less than $22,000 Second 20%: $22,000 – $38,000 Middle 20%: $38,000 – $61,000 Fourth 20%: $61,000 – $91,000 Next 15%: $91,000 –
$163,000 Next 4%: $163,000 – $399,000 Top 1%: +$399,000 8.9% 10% 10.2% 10.2% 9.2% 7.8% 6.2% (Nationwide, the gap was wider: The bottom 20 percent of earners pay 10.9 percent of their income in state and local taxes each year, compared to 5.4 percent paid by the top 1 percent.) It’s important to note that while the study supports McCabe’s statement, it uses a methodology that is accepted by some experts but criticized by others. Todd Berry, president of the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, told us that any effort to assess who bears the burden of state and local taxes depends in part on assumptions that are made. Jared Walczak, an analyst with the Center for State Tax Policy at the free market-oriented Tax Foundation in Washington, D.C., said this study’s ""assumptions do not provide a meaningful way to assess the question"" about the 1 percenters in Wisconsin. The Tax Foundation expressed criticism at the time and Walczak emphasized to us that the study omits some taxes altogether -- such as business license taxes, gross receipts taxes and severance taxes. And the study includes one federal provision -- the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes paid -- to make state tax systems ""look more regressive."" However, data for the omitted taxes were not available, the institute told us. And even if the federal deduction were not considered, the richest 1 percent in Wisconsin would still have a lower state and local tax burden than other income groups in Wisconsin. Richard Auxier, state and local tax policy expert at the nonprofit Tax Policy Center, noted state and local taxes in the vast majority of states, including Wisconsin, are regressive: They rely largely on sales and property taxes, which generally take a bigger bite out of the incomes of lower income people than higher income people. He also said that although Wisconsin’s income tax is relatively progressive, its earned income tax credit, which eases the income tax burden on lower-income residents, isn’t overly generous. So, given the generally regressive nature of taxes states rely upon, McCabe’s statement is not surprising. Indeed, if he made the statement about 48 of the 50 states (except Alaska and California, plus the District of Columbia), it would be on target, according to the report he cited. Our rating McCabe says: ""When you look at all the state and local taxes we pay in Wisconsin, the wealthiest 1 percent pay the lowest overall tax rate."" His claim is based on a 2015 report which found that the top 1 percent of earners (income of $399,000 and above) pay 6.2 percent of their income in state and local taxes -- a lighter burden than six lower income groups. It’s important to note that the report’s methodology has its critics, but it is the latest available study that attempts to assess state and local tax burdens. With that caveat, we rate the statement Mostly True.

Fact-check: Does the GOP health care bill mean steep increases for seniors?
","A Florida Democrat running for governor is warning about massive insurance rate increases for low-income seniors as part of the House Republican health care bill. Chris King, an Orlando-area businessman, recently called on Gov. Rick Scott and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam to disavow the health care overhaul based on analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. ""The only thing as reckless and disappointing as the 800 percent premium increases Florida seniors will face under Trumpcare is Rick Scott and Adam Putnam's silence on the issue,"" King said in a May 25 press release that describes the bill as hiking premiums for low-income seniors. Putnam is running for governor, and Scott is considering running for the U.S. Senate. Is it true? Does the Republican health care plan -- the American Health Care Act -- portend an 800 percent premium increase for low-income Florida seniors. It depends on your definition of seniors. King’s comment could mislead readers to believe that seniors on Medicare face 800 percent premium hikes under the terms of the House bill, and that isn’t the case. The CBO report addresses the impact of the American Health Care Act on individuals up to age 64 who buy on the individual marketplace and not Medicare. However, King does have a point that low-income, older Americans would be hit harder than any other group under the bill that passed the House and earned President Donald Trump’s applause. CBO researchers considered the effect of the bill on a few different age brackets, including consumers who are 64 years old and not yet on Medicare. The May 24 report compares the average amount consumers who are 64 years old would spend in premiums under the current Affordable Care Act with what they would pay under the House legislation in 2026. As written, the House bill would create two choose-your-own-adventure scenarios for states that decide to obtain waivers to certain ""essential health benefits"" under current law. Either scenario, CBO found, means steep increases for older, poorer Americans than under current law. Here’s what the estimates say about average insurance costs for a person 64 years old who earns $26,500 a year in 2026: • Under the Affordable Care Act, that person would pay a net of $1,700 in premium costs for an individual market plan after subsidies. (A 21-year-old and 40-year-old would pay the same amount.) • That net premium rises to $16,100 for states not requesting waivers to certain ""essential health benefits"" under current law. That’s an increase of about 847 percent. • For states that obtain those waivers, the premium rises to $13,600, or a 700 percent increase. Due to those rising costs for low-income older Americans, the CBO predicted that many will lose insurance. ""Although the agencies expect that the legislation would increase the number of uninsured broadly, the increase would be disproportionately larger among older people with lower income — particularly people between 50 and 64 years old with income of less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level,"" the report states. The reason that low-income consumers who are 64 would face such a massive hike in premiums is due to what happens to age rating and tax credit subsidies in the House legislation. ""The changes to the subsidies and age bands all explicitly increase net premiums for seniors. That piece of the CBO score isn’t really up for debate,"" said Chris Sloan at Avalere Health consulting. Under current law, insurance companies can charge older adults up to three times as much as younger people based on their age. The House bill increases the ratio to five times as much starting in 2018. Also under the current Affordable Care Act, tax credits are tied to income, so low-income older Americans receive large tax credits. Subsidies under the House bill, however, are based on age rather than income. The credits also don’t vary based on the cost of insurance in a person’s area. Tax credits for older adults under the House bill are only two times the size of that for younger adults, even though they face premiums that are five times as high, said Linda Blumberg, a health expert at the Urban Institute. The CBO report shows that wealthier older Americans -- 64 year olds earning $68,500 -- would fare far better: They would pay a 5 percent increase in non-waiver states and an 11 percent decrease in waiver states. Overall, the legislation would mean cheaper premiums for some consumers and higher costs for others, said Cynthia Cox, an expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""If you looking for an extreme scenario — someone the most hurt by AHCA — it would be a low- income senior living in a rural area,"" she said. ""The person benefiting the most is a young affluent urbanite."" The CBO figures are based on a national average; insurance premiums can vary from county to county with costs rising in rural areas, according to other estimates. The Kaiser Family Foundation’s map shows that under AHCA a 60-year-old earning $20,000 a year would face a 772 percent increase for a premium in Miami-Dade. The same senior would pay a 1,594 percent increase in the Big Bend’s Gadsden County. The Senate has not released its version of the health care bill, which could result in a drastically different situation for older Americans. Trump officials have talked about making other legislative and regulatory changes that they say would drive down the cost of health insurance. King said a Congressional Budget Office report shows that low-income seniors in Florida will face ""800 percent premium increases"" under the American Health Care Act. King was referring to a report that analyzed premium costs for seniors who are 64 and therefore not yet on Medicare. The report showed that average premiums for a 64-year-old earning $26,500 will rise dramatically if the bill becomes law — between 700 and 847 percent depending on a state’s choices. That puts low-income, older Americans in a disproportionately affected position compared to other age and income groups. But the King said seniors, which certainly would include people 65 and older. Most of those people are covered by Medicare. The CBO report does not apply to them. King’s statement is partially accurate but missing needed context, we rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2017/jun/02/chris-king/does-ahca-increase-health-care-premiums-low-income/

Are Nicaragua and Syria the only countries not to sign Paris Agreement?
","Just a few hours before President Donald Trump was set to announce whether he will withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change, Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz questioned the president’s reported intent to walk away from the accord. ""Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough. What's Trump's excuse?"" the representative from Florida tweeted June 1. Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough. What's Trump's excuse? Trump’s promise to ""cancel"" the Paris Agreement is one of more than 100 promises we are tracking on the Trump-O-Meter. News outlets reported that Trump was leaning toward exiting the global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep global average temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius. Wasserman Schultz tweet left us wondering if she was right about only two nations — Syria and Nicaragua — not signing the agreement, and that the Central American nation refused to sign because the agreement ""wasn’t tough enough."" Information from the United Nations and statements by Nicaraguan representatives support her statement.   The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in 1992 and entered into force in 1994. It consists of 197 Parties (196 States and 1 regional economic integration organization). Among them are the United States, Syria and Nicaragua. The UNFCCC’s ultimate goal is ""preventing ‘dangerous’ human interference with the climate system,"" that includes greenhouse gas concentrations, according to the UNFCCC’s website. Parties to the UNFCCC during a December 2015 session in Paris adopted the Paris Agreement, seeking ""to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change."" One of the objectives is to hold the increase in global average temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. A total of 175 parties signed the agreement on April 22, 2016, according to information from the UN. The agreement remained opened for signatures from April 22, 2016, to April 21, 2017. The latest nation to sign was Uzbekistan, on April 19. Overall total signatories: 195.  The only countries in the world that did not sign: Syria and Nicaragua.  The Paris Agreement came into effect in November 2016 after 55 countries accounting for at least 55 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions formally ratified the agreement. So far, 147 parties have ratified the agreement. Wasserman Schultz office referred us to several news reports indicating that if the United States abandons the Paris agreement, it would join Syria and Nicaragua as nonparticipants. Reuters in December 2015 reported that Nicaragua objected to the climate agreement ""saying it did not do enough to protect ‘Mother Earth,’ in a symbolic protest after the deal had been formally adopted."" The news agency noted that Paul Oquist, head of the Nicaraguan delegation at the December 2015 session, said wealthy nations should do more to reduce their emissions. Nicaragua also had said developed nations were ""not doing enough to reduce their use of carbon and are not providing sufficient funding to help the developed world adapt to the impact of climate change,"" Reuters reported. ""We’re not going to submit because voluntary responsibility is a path to failure,"" Oquist told Climate Home in 2015, a media organization covering climate news. He added: ""It’s a not a matter of being troublemakers, it’s a matter of the developing countries surviving."" In September 2016, a Spanish-language post by the United Nations also said that the Nicaraguan vice president, Moisés Omar Halleslevens Acevedo, had reiterated his nation’s concerns on global warming but did not believe the Paris Agreement would prevent the worsening of the global issue. ""Many of us concur that what was agreed in Paris is not sufficient,"" and more ambitious actions are urgent, Halleslevens Acevedo told the UN General Assembly in September 2016. Nicaraguan media have also reported that Nicaragua’s absence from the agreement is due to its concerns over the agreement, not out of lack of concern for climate change. Amid a civil war since 2011, Syria’s participation in the agreement has been difficult because members of the Syrian government are subject to European and American sanctions. Wasserman Schultz tweeted, ""Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough."" A total 195 of the 197 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change signed the Paris Agreement. That includes all the countries in the world, except Syria and Nicaragua. Nicaraguan representatives have said the Paris Agreement is ""not sufficient"" and believe rich nations should do more to reduce their emissions.

","Bloggers revived an 18-month-old fake news story that greatly distorts Republican Sen. Marco Rubio’s position on abortion. ""Rubio: ‘Rape victims should be in custody if there is suspicion that they’re planning abortion,’ "" reads the headline on USPOLN.com (short for U.S. political news). USPOLN.com, which describes itself as a ""hybrid news/satire platform,"" published the article May 23, 2017. But the story talks about a statement the Florida senator allegedly made at a New Hampshire town hall during his presidential campaign, which ended more than a year ago. As its source, USPOLN.com links to a Nov. 8, 2015, story on politicono.com, also a regular purveyor of fake news. The article was flagged by Facebook users as potentially being fabricated. The article drastically veers away from Rubio’s real position on abortion. USPOLN.com made up this flippant, over-the-top quote and attributed it to Rubio: ""I’m just totally against the whole shebang, I won’t deny it. I am appalled by how insensitive and self-centered rape victims can sometimes be. I mean, sure, okay, you were just violated in the most intimate way, and sure, you had to undergo a detailed physical examination afterwards, but that doesn’t mean you have the right to kill an innocent baby regardless of what it’s father has done to you, come on."" Reporters and debate moderators asked Rubio about his position on abortion and rape victims on several occasions during his primary campaign. Rubio opposes rape and incest exemptions for abortion. He never said rape victims considering abortion should be jailed. In fact, Rubio has cosponsored legislation that bans abortions but includes exemptions for victims of rape and incest. He said he does not support these exemptions but recognizes that they are necessary to get more support for the legislation. ""A rape is an act of violence,"" he told MSNBC’s Chuck Todd in August 2015. ""It's a horrifying thing that happens. And fortunately the number of abortions in this country that are due to rape are very small, less than 1 percent of the cases in the world. But they happen and they're horrifying and they're tragic, and I recognize that."" He added, ""That being said, I recognize that in order to have a consensus on laws that limit the number of abortions, a lot of people want to see those exceptions and that's why I've supported those laws in the past, as has every pro-life group in America."" USPOLN.com’s about page includes a disclaimer, warning readers that its articles ""may not be reliable"" and that they should consider ""any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney."" Yet a perusal of the comments at the bottom of the article shows that at least some people fell for this explosive fake headline about Rubio.

Rick Perry says neither Obama or Calderon have been on U.S.-Mexico border Mexico and Texas
","UPDATE, 11:15 a.m., March 7, 2011: After this article was published, readers alerted us to President Obama's Aug. 31, 2010, trip to Fort Bliss in El Paso. According to a transcript of his remarks, Obama thanked the soldiers and talked about his upcoming address to the nation on Iraq and Afghanistan; he made no mention of the border situation or Mexico during his two-hour visit. Gov. Rick Perry told an interviewer Wednesday that he’d dearly love to be part of Thursday’s White House meeting between President Barack Obama and Mexico President Felipe Calderon. Perry then told Greta Van Susteren of Fox News: ""You know, neither one of them have been on the border to see what's happening to the citizens of Mexico, and for that matter the citizens of Texas."" For real? We asked Perry’s office for back-up information, simultaneously trying to reach Calderon’s press contact and the White House on whether and why each president has ventured to the border. An online search yielded news articles showing that both Calderon, sworn in as president in 2006, and Obama, president since early 2009, have been to the U.S.-Mexico border, though it appears Obama has traveled there just once, while he was seeking the Democratic nomination for president. As president, he went to Mexico City in 2009. At least three times in 2010, Calderon visited Ciudad Juarez, the city adjoining El Paso, in the wake of January 2010 slayings that drew international attention. The Mexican city had experienced more than 2,500 killings in 2009, according to a CNN dispatch, which also quoted Calderon saying there: ""I come mostly to listen... we're looking for solutions from Juarez because you are the ones living it."" Also in 2010, Calderon visited Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville, and Piedras Negras, opposite Eagle Pass, in the wake of a hurricane. He also helped open an international bridge in Reynosa, near McAllen, at a cross-border event where Obama’s emissary was U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, the former Dallas mayor. And Obama? In February 2008, according to a CBS News report, then-candidate Obama courted Brownsville voters. The report says he and state Rep. Eddie Lucio III briefly stood near the U.S. bank of the Rio Grande, looking across the border. According to the report, Obama joked: ""This is the first time that I've been this close here, in Texas. I've been in Mexico when I was in college and was going to school in Southern California. I can't entirely talk about it."" Obama went to Mexico City in April 2009 as part of a swing through Latin America. An April 16, 2009 news article in the New York Times says Obama was the first American president since Bill Clinton to visit Mexico’s capital, where he hoped to shore up Calderon’s ""efforts to combat the rising tide of cross-border drug violence."" This February, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano invited Republican and Democratic U.S. House leaders to join her at the Mexican border this spring, according to a Feb. 10 Politico news article. Republicans have urged Obama to visit the border. In March 2010, Texas U.S. Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn sent Obama a letter including an invitation to join them on a visit to the border region. ""Such a visit would draw national attention to a national priority,"" the letter says, ""and allow you to thank the federal and local officials who are doing heroic work to protect our communities."" In September 2010, U.S. Sen. John McCain told a Fox News interviewer that he wanted Obama to visit the border. ""I’d love for the president to come and visit the border. Unfortunately, he hasn’t had time to do so,"" the Wall Street Journal quoted McCain saying. Next, we asked CBS News’ White House correspondent Mark Knoller to check his well-respected log of presidential trips. Knoller said by e-mail that as president, Obama has not made any U.S.-Mexico border stops. He said Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush, delivered a speech on border security in El Paso in March 2002, also watching a demonstration of technology that detects contraband in border-crossing vehicles. Knoller said Bush also came to Tucson and El Paso in November 2005 and in May 2006 made a trip to Yuma to observe National Guard troops on the border. Finally, we asked political scientist David Shirk, director of the non-partisan Trans-Border Institute at San Diego University, how he’d appraise Perry’s claim. Shirk said Perry’s wrong about Calderon, but correct per Obama who, Shirk said, ""has not visited the border region since the start of his presidency to examine the circumstances that we’re facing here in communities like San Diego and El Paso, places where we are very close to the violence and there’s been a lot of discussion about the possible spillover effects."" As for whether Obama is ""right for not visiting the border,"" that’s a separate question, Shirk said, adding that the answer depends on whether the ""situation and the (status) of border residents today (is) more important"" than other issues on the nation’s agenda.

To our inquiry about Obama’s border travels, White House spokesman Adam Abrams declined comment. We didn’t hear back from Perry and failed to connect with Calderon’s office.

Perry’s statement appears to be accurate per Obama, but it’s unmoored regarding Calderon. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/04/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-neither-mexico-president-felipe-ca/
"['Georgia', 'Burrell Ellis']","
DeKalb CEO says he wields a big budget ax
","
DeKalb County Chief Executive Officer Burrell Ellis lost a recent battle with county commissioners on his proposal to raise property taxes to help balance the budget.

The seven-member board chose instead to order an additional $33.6 million in cuts, insisting there’s more fat to be trimmed.

Ellis and some DeKalb officials worry the additional cuts might take a toll on public safety in the county. Ellis vented.

""We’ve cut $109 million. I think we’ve done more than any local government in the metro Atlanta region,"" he told reporters after the board’s vote on Feb. 22.

The second part of that quote piqued our curiosity. Has DeKalb cut more than anyone else?

DeKalb’s communications director, Burke Brennan, explained and offered a slight correction. Ellis was discussing how much money he and the commissioners have cut from DeKalb’s general fund budget -- which pays for police, fire rescue and most county services -- since he became CEO in January 2009. DeKalb’s budget was $636 million in 2008. With the additional cuts adopted by commissioners last month, the general fund budget is about $529 million, county officials say. That’s actually a $107 million decrease, Brennan said, not $109 million.

There are 73 cities, counties and towns in the 10 counties that are part of the Atlanta Regional Commission. It didn’t seem fair to compare the budgets of, say, Clayton County’s Lake City (population 2,886) to DeKalb, which had a population of 747,274, according to the most recent U.S. census data. We decided, instead, to compare DeKalb to the similarly sized governments of Cobb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties and the city of Atlanta, which all have populations in excess of 500,000.

DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett base their budgets on a calendar-year basis. Atlanta’s budget year begins each July 1 and ends June 30. Cobb’s budget year begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. We compared the last four budgets adopted by each government.

In 2008, Fulton County’s general fund budget was nearly $671.5 million. The county’s budget has declined in each year to its 2011 budget of nearly $595 million. That’s an 11 percent decline of $76.5 million. Fulton officials told us they actually spent $35 million to $60 million less in 2008, 2009 and 2010.

Gwinnett County’s general fund budget has gone up and down since 2008. In 2008, it was nearly $456 million. It rose to nearly $510 million in 2010. This year’s budget is $448.6 million, $7 million -- or 2 percent -- less than it was in 2008.

Atlanta, like DeKalb, has cut its general fund budget significantly since 2008. The city budget was about $645 million in fiscal year 2008, which began July 1, 2007, and ended June 30, 2008. The city cut hundreds of jobs from the payroll in fiscal year 2009, resulting in a general fund budget of nearly $571 million. The current fiscal year budget, which ends June 30, is approximately $559 million. That’s an $86 million difference that is 13 percent lower than fiscal year 2008.

Cobb County’s general fund budget for 2008 was nearly $338 million. The county’s general fund budget includes most of the same services as the others, but there are some differences. For example, a portion of the property taxes goes specifically to the fire department budget, which is about $65 million for the current fiscal year. The fiscal year budget for 2011 is $328 million, a 3 percent drop from FY 2008.

Since 2008, the numbers show DeKalb has cut more money from its general budget than any of the governments its size. The $107 million DeKalb has cut amounts to a 17 percent decrease over that time span. That is a larger percentage than the other governments. It appears CEO Ellis is on the money with this claim.

Gov. John Kasich says only California and Michigan lost more jobs than Ohio in the last decade
","
Jobs were the leading issue in Ohio's 2010 election campaign, and the issue has lost none of its importance or utility to officeholders.

Gov. John Kasich brought it up twice in two days in interviews on CNN. The first-term Republican cited the state's loss of jobs among the reasons he backed Senate Bill 5, which would eliminate collective bargaining rights for state employees.

""We have lost 600,000 jobs over the period of the last 10 years,"" Kasich said. ""Only Michigan and California have done worse.""

We thought that was worth checking, especially because employment figures are estimates, measured several different ways.

The Current Population Survey (CPS) is based on household interviews conducted each month by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It counts employed individuals, and its data is used in calculating unemployment.

The monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey uses payroll records and counts unique jobs. Normally the headline jobs figure, it is preferred by the Congressional Budget Office and Bureau of Labor Statistics for measuring job growth.

According to the CES survey and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 5,002,900 jobs in Ohio in December 2010. Ten years earlier, in December 2000, the number was 5,613,000.

That's a loss of about 610,000 jobs -- and the decline is even larger from the peak level of 5,638,100 jobs in May 2000.

Kasich had Ohio's number right.

But was it the nation’s third worst?

California, which had 13,897,100 jobs in December 2010, lost 803,000 jobs from December 2000, and 1,305,500 jobs from the state’s peak level of July 2007, according to the CES survey.

Michigan had 3,831,500 jobs in December 2010, a loss of 832,800 from December 2000.

Kasich was correct that both states lost more jobs than Ohio from the start to the finish of the decade ending last December. No other states lost more by that measure.

But there’s a footnote we’ll also add about boom-or-bust Florida, which qualifies as both a gainer and a loser. The state gained about 30,000 jobs from December 2000 to December 2010, when it had 7,193,900 in the CES survey.

From its peak level of March 2007, however, Florida has lost 876,500 jobs -- more than any state except California.

But for purposes of the Truth-O-Meter, words matter. Kasich’s statement was that over the last 10 years, Ohio lost 600,000 jobs and that only Michigan and California have done worse. And in terms of net change over the decade, he’s right on the money.

We rate his statement as True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/04/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-only-california-and-michigan-/
"['Labor', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says local public unions rushed through contracts without employee contributions for pensions and health care
","
The drum roll was building a little each day.

On Feb. 24, 2011, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker issued a news release titled, ""Union bosses say one thing, do another.""

The release charged that while union leaders were saying their members would contribute more to their pensions and kick in more for health insurance -- as called for in Walker’s budget repair bill -- they were actually signing local contracts that did neither.

The governor banged the drum a little louder during a news conference that day, saying a variety of local governments were in a ""rush to ram through employee contracts"" that do not include the greater share from employees -- effectively a pay cut -- for health and pensions.

Finally, Walker pounded the biggest drum yet, repeating the claim in response to the first question posed by moderator David Gregory during Walker’s appearance Feb. 27, 2011, on NBC’s ""Meet the Press.""

""We’ve seen local union after local union rush to their school boards, their city councils, their technical school boards and rush through contracts in the past two weeks that had no contributions to the pension and no contribution to health care,"" said Walker. ""And, in fact, in one case in Janesville, they actually were pushing through a pay increase. Actions do speak louder than words.""

That’s a lot of drum beating.

But is the truth taking a beating?

Asked for backup on the statement, Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie pointed to about a half dozen units of government that ratified contracts since Feb. 11, 2011 -- the day Walker released his budget-repair bill.

""And those are the only ones we know about,"" he added.

Walker’s bill contains demands for increased health premiums and contributions by government workers to their state retirement plans. The bill, which exempts most law enforcement and firefighters, would sharply curtail collective bargaining rights for most other employees.

The changes would not apply to contracts in place at the time the bill is signed. So unions would have an incentive to cut a deal now for fear they will soon lose the ability to negotiate much of anything.

We took the list provided by Walker and decided to check it twice to see who, according to the governor, has been naughty or nice.

Let’s start with a key aspect of Walker’s statement.

He said the newly ratified contracts had ""no contributions to the pension and no contribution to health care."" While they do not meet the size of the contribution called for in Walker’s budget repair bill, each pact does include some employee contributions to health insurance. In Madison, however, the contract would require very few workers to contribute to their premiums.

Now, let's look at the details of each contract cited, beginning in Walker’s new backyard.

Madison: Unions in the state’s second biggest city have been negotiating contracts for more than a year. Their pacts expired at the beginning of 2010.

Contracts with two of Madison’s biggest public unions settled before Walker was inaugurated Jan. 3, 2011, said Brad Wirtz, Madison human resources director. He said who said those deals set the template for the remaining unions, who reached agreement on wages and other key financial issues after Walker took office but before Feb. 11, when Walker announced his plan. The remaining issues were negotiated after Feb. 11, Wirtz said.

Madison Mayor Dave Cieslewicz said the time frame presented a dilemma.

He said he didn’t want to wait until the council's regularly scheduled meeting on Feb. 23, because he feared the Legislature would pass Walker’s budget-repair bill before that date. (This was before the 14 state Senate Democrats fled the state, blocking a vote on the bill.) That could have created a split in the work force, with one half better off than the other half.

So, Cieslewciz, scheduled a special session of the the council for Feb. 17 and the contracts were ratified.  He urged Secretary of State Doug La Follette to wait as long as possible before taking steps that would make the budget repair bill law – that is, if it had it been passed by the Senate.

Cieslewicz said he was trying to avoid ""having frozen in amber an inequitable situation"" among city workers.

Sheboygan County: Officials there are running the risk Madison dodged. Adam Payne, the county’s administrator, said the county approved a contract with the union representing nurses on Feb. 15, 2011 -- four days after Walker’s proposal.

But, Payne said, the agreement between negotiators was struck before Feb. 11 and it mirrors pacts reached with other unions late last year. ""There was no special treatment,"" Payne said noting the County Board approved the contract at a regularly scheduled meeting.

Payne took  offense at having his county listed on Walker’s ram-it-through list.  

In fact, he said, agreement on the contract covering courthouse workers has also been reached, but the County Board is not scheduled to act on it until March 15, 2011. Thus, depending on what happens at the Capitol  -- and when it happens -- the county could be left with unions under different sets of rules, the scenario Madison avoided.

Janesville schools:  This Rock County city got a special mention on ""Meet the Press"" when Walker said, ""in Janesville, they actually were pushing through a pay increase.""

Walker was right when he said the school board approved a contract that included a pay hike.

Kevin Murray, a board member who helped negotiate the contracts, said the pact with custodial workers was ratified Feb. 22, 2011, but a second contract -- this one with secretarial workers -- isn’t scheduled for board action until March 8.  

The custodians, like the teachers before them, agreed to a pay freeze retroactive to the 2009-’10 school year, followed by three years of raises averaging about 2 percent per year. The pending contract for clerical workers has a one-year freeze followed by two annual raises of 2 percent each. All the contract expire at the end of the 2012-’13 school year.

Murray said there was no rushing on Walker’s behalf.

The tentative agreement for custodians was reached Jan. 25, 2011 -- before Walker’s proposals were made public. The tentative agreement with secretarial workers was reached Feb. 21, after Walker’s announcement. But, as in Sheboygan, the future of that agreement could hinge on what happens -- and when -- in the Capitol.

Murray noted talks for the various contracts started in either 2010 or 2009, and all of the school union workers had been working without contracts. Said Murray: ""We don’t believe we should not be ratifying these things because of what might come down from Madison.""

However, that feeling was not unanimous.

The vote approving the custodial workers contract was 5-4, with the losing side arguing the board should wait to see what happens In Madison.

Janesville city: The City of Janesville dealt with some of the same uncertainty when contracts with city workers, which also included pay increases, were ratified by the city and the unions after Walker made his announcement.

Eric Levitt, city manager, said that in January he had set a mid-February target to settle contracts, so the talks continued on the previously set timetable.

The two sides were close to reaching tentative agreements prior to Walker’s Feb. 11 announcement, Levitt said. He said the city felt that because of its obligation to negotiate in good faith, it was necessary to continue the talks after the governor made his call for increased payments by employees.

La Crosse County: Agreements with seven of the county’s eight bargaining units were approved between Feb. 17 and 21, 2011, meaning both sides were aware of what Walker was up to.

County Administrator Steve O’Malley argued the county didn’t rush things since negotiations started last year and the first tentative agreement with a local was reached in December.

Racine: City Administrator Thomas Friedel said Walker is ""technically correct but there were extenuating circumstances.""

He explained that Racine had been negotiating with  bargaining units representing Department of Public Works and clerical workers since summer of 2010 and reached tentative agreements well before Walker made his move. The Common Council approved the pacts Feb. 15, 2011, which was the first available date after the unions approved the contracts, said Scott Letteney, assistant city attorney. .

Friedel said the city felt to delay action after all the months of negotiation would be a breach of good faith bargaining that had already taken place.

Milwaukee Area Technical College: Like all of the other governments, the technical college and the union representing teachers and other workers had been talking for months -- starting back when Walker was a candidate for governor.

The board and the American Federation of Teachers Local 212 reached tentative agreement on Feb. 10 -- the day before Walker’s announcement.

The agreement froze wages for two years but -- like the other contracts -- did not match Walker’s proposals on health insurance and pensions. Union president Michael Rosen said a negotiating session was originally scheduled for Jan. 31, 2011, but was delayed because an MATC negotiator broke his hand.

The union membership approved the contract on Feb. 16 and the MATC board held a special meeting that night to ratify the contract. The board held a special meeting rather than voting on the contract at its regularly scheduled meeting the following week.  

Were they rushing things to beat the legislative clock?

""Rush is such a subjective word,"" said Kathleen Hohl, the college’s communications director.

Indeed it is.

And it’s our job to figure out if it applies.

On ""Meet the Press,"" Walker said he seen ""local union after local union rush ... through contracts in the past two weeks that had no contributions to the pension and no contribution to health care."" While the contracts did not match the health care payment he is seeking, they did include health care increases. But what about the rush?

Walker’s words suggest the situation was common, but his office provided only about half a dozen examples. The words also suggest late-night sessions to finalize deals, when each example cited involved negotiations that had been going on for months -- and in some cases were finalized before Walker’s budget-repair bill was unveiled.

Two governmental bodies -- Madison and MATC -- tapped on the accelerator to get deals approved before state lawmakers could slam on the breaks. But two others, Janesville schools and Sheboygan County, are making their workers wait until the contracts are brought up for a vote at regularly scheduled board meetings. That doesn’t reflect the ram-it-through image Walker pointed to. We rate his statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/03/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-local-public-unions-rushed-t/

Rep. Betty McCollum says Army spends millions on NASCAR team sponsorship
","
Rep. Betty McCollum says the government wastes a remarkable amount of money sponsoring a NASCAR team -- $7 million a year. 
""In 2011, the U.S. Army is sponsoring Ryan Newman's #39 Chevrolet Impala in the Spirit Cup series at a cost to the taxpayers of $7 million,"" McCollum, D-Minn., said in a statement.

A reader wondered whether this was true, so we looked into it.

The NASCAR sponsorship was cited many times during the recent House of Representatives deliberations on budget cuts. During one round of budget-cutting in February 2011, the House voted to slice more than $61 billion from the budget, but it spared the money that the Army pays to sponsor Newman's NASCAR team.

The Army has sponsored various NASCAR teams for many years and has sponsored Newman's for the past two years. Backers of the expenditure say sponsorship pays off in recruiting leads. ""Last year alone, the U.S. Army's motor sports programs generated more than 46,000 qualified leads, more than 1,300 pledges of support from key business and community leaders, and more than 484 million media impressions (34 million of which offered specific Army recruiting messages),"" said Newman in a website discussion.

A spokesman for Stewart-Haas Racing confirmed that the Army pays $7.4 million for its co-sponsorship. The team's website quotes Newman saying that he is energized by the sponsorship.

""Being around the U.S. Army soldiers is an inspiration to me and the race team,"" he said. ""The physical, emotional and mental strength of these individuals is a driving force behind our mission to get the soldier’s car into Victory Lane.""

But to McCollum the sponsorship is too much.

""Taxpayer-funded NASCAR race cars are an absurdity at a time when the Republican-Tea Party is cutting federal support for homeless veterans, law enforcement officers, and firefighters,"" McCollum said in a press release announcing her proposed amendment.

""With trillion dollar deficits, this amendment is where the rubber meets the road for my Republican Tea Party colleagues,"" she said. But her amendment failed.

We won't weigh in on the debate over whether the Army's money is well spent or not. When it comes to the dollars, though, McCollum is on the mark, so we rate this statement True.

Matt Miller blasts deficit, debt implications of Paul Ryan's budget proposal
","
In a Feb. 24, 2011, column in the Washington Post, Matt Miller, a senior fellow with the liberal Center for American Progress, criticized Republican plans for the federal budget. Miller specifically took aim at a ""roadmap"" put forth by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the chairman of the House Budget Committee.
   
""We're so accustomed to political flimflam that, as (the late Democratic Sen.) Daniel Patrick Moynihan might have put it, we're defining truth-telling down,"" Miller wrote. He charged that leading Republicans have so far only offered ""half-truths"" about the long-term budget realities.
   
""Thanks to House budget chief Paul Ryan, it's possible to measure the size of this fraud. And it's colossal,"" Miller wrote. ""As can never be said often enough, Ryan is absurdly hailed as a fiscal ‘conservative’ for a ‘roadmap’ that doesn't balance the budget until the 2060s and that adds an unthinkable $62 trillion to the national debt between now and then.""
   
Miller said that Ryan ""pretends we can keep federal taxes at their recent historic levels of 19 percent of gross domestic product as the boomers age. No can do. The math doesn't work. Ryan's endless red ink proves this.""
   
As Congressional leaders and the White House negotiate over the next federal budget, we thought we’d check whether Miller fairly characterizes Ryan’s proposal -- specifically whether it’s true that Ryan’s roadmap ""doesn't balance the budget until the 2060s and … adds an unthinkable $62 trillion to the national debt.""
   
First, we turned to Ryan’s roadmap itself. In a summary table, Ryan provided the amounts for outlays, revenues, deficits or surpluses, and debt for every year of the plan through 2083. (Yes, through 2083 -- more on that in a moment.) Ryan’s table offers these figures as a percentage of gross domestic product rather than as dollar amounts.
   
For the question of when the budget reaches balance, Miller is correct. The percentage of GDP shifts from negative (representing a deficit) to positive (a surplus) in 2063. From that point on, the percentage stays in positive territory -- that is, in surplus -- through 2083.
   
An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’s non-partisan arbiter of budgetary figures -- doesn’t list the exact year that surpluses first occur under Ryan’s plan, but it agrees that it will happen sometime between 2060 and 2080. So on this point Miller appears to be correct.
   
How about Miller’s claim that Ryan would add $62 trillion to the debt?
   
We couldn’t find a $62 trillion figure in either Ryan’s roadmap or in the CBO analysis. We looked back at a previous column and discovered that Miller had also mentioned the figure there. Here’s what he wrote:
   
""According to the Congressional Budget Office, Ryan's plan would result in annual deficits of between 3.5 and 4.5 percent of GDP between now and somewhere after 2040, with a balanced budget coming only around 2063,"" Miller wrote. ""This would add at least $62 trillion to the national debt over the period. (My estimate is conservative mostly because the independent Tax Policy Center says Ryan's tax reforms would produce far less revenue than Ryan required the CBO to assume.)""
   
In other words, the $62 trillion figure is an estimate that Miller -- not Ryan or CBO -- produced, and it doesn’t cover the debt added by Ryan’s plan through either 2080 (the final year of CBO’s analysis) or 2083 (the final year of Ryan’s projection).

Miller told PolitiFact that his $62 trillion estimate was conservative, stopping the count at 2050 rather than the deficit/surplus tipping point of 2063, and using lower annual debt estimates than CBO did.
   
Whether or not Miller's figure is right -- and the number is certainly in the trillions of dollars -- it's important to note that he was selective in choosing his time frame.
   
That’s because between 2063 and 2080, the federal debt under Ryan’s plan is projected to disappear. In fact, by 2083, the debt under Ryan’s plan would actually turn into a surplus -- a surplus equal to one-sixth of the nation’s GDP.
   
These numbers come from Ryan’s proposal, but CBO’s analysis essentially backs them up, agreeing that the national debt would fall to between negative 0.5 percent and positive 0.5 percent of GDP in 2080. In other words, CBO reckons that the debt would be either small, zero, or in a modest surplus by then.
   
So while Miller has a point that it would take Ryan 52 years to balance the budget -- and that perhaps trillions of dollars in debt will be added between now and then -- the columnist leaves out the counterpoint that Ryan’s plan would eliminate the federal debt after an additional 17 to 20 years.
   
There’s also another bit of missing context: Under the status quo, it would take even longer to reach a surplus, and the U.S. would acquire even more debt.
   
There aren’t many budgetary projections that look 69 years into the future. But CBO does produce long-term budget analyses, including one under a scenario in which the current baseline budget numbers are adjusted to include changes to those policies that are widely expected to be enacted.
   
Under this status-quo scenario, CBO sees the deficit growing consistently as a percentage of GDP, from 7.4 percent of GDP in 2020 to 17.2 percent in 2040, 28 percent in 2060 and 42.8 percent in 2080.
   
So under this model there isn’t a surplus in sight at all, at least through 2080.
   
As for debt, the situation is similar. According to CBO, the status-quo model produces debt levels that reach 433 percent of GDP by 2060 and 716 percent of GDP by 2080. The comparable numbers for Ryan’s plan are 77 percent of GDP by 2060 and essentially zero by 2080.
   
By glossing over what happens to the debt under Ryan’s plan between 2063 and 2083, Miller does give a misleading impression of its projected full fiscal impact.
   
Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, calls Miller’s debt assertion ""ridiculous. Yes, Ryan's plan may allow $62 trillion of debt, but that is far, far, far less than what would happen under current law.""

But Miller makes two counter-arguments.
   
First, Miller isn’t advocating the status-quo plan CBO used. To the contrary, his point is that while some of Ryan’s proposed policies are admirable, the lawmaker should be more aggressive about deficits and the debt by proposing tax increases. Such increases, which are anathema to most Republicans, could help reduce the deficit and the debt much more quickly than Ryan’s plan would.
   
Second, 70-year budgetary estimates ought to be taken with a big grain of salt. On the one hand, economists use the tools they have available, and because much of the federal budget is dictated by long-term demographics -- including Social Security and Medicare -- experts in the field say that the numbers are reasonable approximations.

Still, 2083 is as long in the future as 1939 is in the past. Any estimates made in 1939 about what the nation’s economy would look like in 2011 would not have accounted for factors that were unimaginable then, from the baby boom to free trade policies to computerization and the Internet.

""Ryan is the one who claims his plan is ‘conservative,’"" Miller told PolitiFact. ""The idea that he runs 62 or 80 or 100 trillion in debt but then pledges to do better when all of us are long dead is silly.""
   
So where does this leave us?

On the one hand, Miller’s statement fails to mention the fact that Ryan’s plan does eventually eliminate the debt, according to CBO -- a sizable achievement when one realizes that under status quo policies, the debt would be more than seven times the size of the nation’s economy. Still, an outcome 70 years from now is subject to a lot of uncertainty, and Miller’s actual statement was phrased carefully. It’s true, as he says, that Ryan’s plan ""doesn't balance the budget until the 2060s,"" and before it gets there, it will probably add trillions of dollars in debt. It’s a close call, but we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/03/matt-miller/matt-miller-blasts-deficit-debt-implications-paul-/
"['Jobs', 'Virginia', 'Brian Moran']","
Virginia Democratic chairman Brian Moran says Gov. Bob McDonnell failed to create ample jobs
","
In a sluggish economy where the spotlight has been on elected officials’ efforts to boost employment, the state Democratic Party is saying Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell’s job creation efforts are disappointing.

A Feb. 25 news release from the Democratic Party of Virginia cited statistics from a Bureau of Labor Statistics report released that same day showing Virginia’s monthly unemployment rates during 2010 averaged out at 6.9 percent. That’s a slight increase from the 2009 average of 6.8 percent.

The Democrats also noted the BLS reported a drop in the state’s percentage of working age people with jobs. It fell from 64.9 percent in 2009 to 64.1 percent in 2010.

Brian Moran, chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, fired out a news release charging the numbers demonstrate ""the governor and his team did not even create enough jobs to keep pace with population growth.""

We dove into the BLS numbers to see if Moran is right.

We started with his claim that in 2010 - the first year of  McDonnell’s term -  Virginia’s average monthly unemployment rate rose .1 percent to 6.9 percent. That’s true, but it provides an skewed picture.

That’s because when McDonnell was inaugurated in January 2010, the state unemployment rate was 7.2 percent -- its highest point of the year. The rate slowly declined the rest of the year and ended at 6.6 percent by December, ranking Virginia 9th lowest in the nation.

In other words, the unemployment rate improved during McDonnell’s first year as governor. And one could make an argument that, when it comes to computing the monthly average for 2010, McDonnell was hurt by a relatively high unemployment rate he inherited from his predecessor, Democrat Tim Kaine.

Moran doesn’t go there. Nor does he mention that Virginia’s monthly unemployment rate in 2009 -- Kaine’s last full year in office -- increased from 5.7 percent in January to 7.2 percent in December.

We’re not pointing this out to say one governor performed better that the other. Economists have repeatedly told us that governors have a limited impact on employment in their states. We’re merely pointing out that there’s a variety of ways to interpret these statistics.

Virginia’s 6.9 percent unemployment rate for 2010 was far better than the national rate of 9.6 percent.

Let’s turn to Moran’s second assertion, that percentage of working-age Virginians with jobs fell from 64.9 percent in 2009 to 64.1 percent in 2010. His numbers are correct.

We were curious whether the percentage of the state’s population with jobs continued to improve throughout 2010 just like the unemployment rate did.

To the contrary, the numbers got worse.  The percentage of employed working-age Virginians declined from 64.3 percent in January to 63.9 percent in December.

So, as Moran says the population growth did indeed outpace job growth in 2010. But is that McDonnell’s fault?

Howard Wial, an economist and fellow with the left-leaning Brookings Institution, is dismissive of Moran’s use of the BLS statistics to to fault McDonnell.

""I’m not saying the governor is right that he’s been a wonderful job creator or that the Democrats are right in saying he hasn’t been,"" Wial said. ""I’m just saying that these numbers don’t prove anything either way … They don’t show you any connection between public policy and results.""

Virginia, with 64.1 percent of its working age population employed last year, out-performed the national average of 58.5 percent. Just like Virginia, the national percentage of working age people who were employed declined by .8 percent from 2009 to 2010.

At the end of Kaine’s term, the percentage of employed working-age Virginians fell by 1.8 percent -- from 66.7 percent in 2008 to 64.9 percent in 2009. So the same argument Moran uses to disparage McDonnell’s performance could also be hurled at Kaine.

Let’s review.

Moran uses two sets of data to prove his point that job growth lagged a rise in population during McDonnell’s first year as governor.

He says Virginia’s the average of Virginia’s monthly unemployment rates rose in 2010.While technically correct, a month-to-month review shows the unemployment rate was at a high point when McDonnell took office in January and fell throughout the year. Moran’s use of the annual unemployment rates is misleading and cloaks that improvement.

Moran also cites a drop in the percentage of working-age Virginians who were employed last year. The numbers certainly confirm his claim that state job growth did not keep pace with population growth. So he’s right on the trend, but it’s questionable whether the sluggish job environment can be laid at the feet of a governor who has been in office for a year.

While there is some truth in Moran’s statement, he also uses a misleading figure to paint an inaccurate picture of the jobs situation under McDonnell. We rate the statement Half True.

Sen. Sherrod Brown touts business incubators' job creation powers
","
Business incubators, known as business ""accelerators"" in Europe, serve as homes and training grounds for new companies, providing them an affordable start-up environment and a variety of administrative, consulting and networking services.

When President Obama came to Cleveland on Feb. 22 to talk about ways to help small businesses, Sen. Sherrod Brown used the opportunity to tout legislation he has written called the Business Incubation Promotion Act, which would help create more business incubators in hard-hit regions of the country.

In an opinion piece he penned for The Plain Dealer, Brown said: ""For every $10,000 invested in business incubators, up to nearly 70 local jobs are generated.""

An impressive success rate, we thought, and a potentially worthwhile investment -- if true.

So we decided to put Brown’s claims through the Truth-O-Meter.

Brown spokeswoman Meghan Dubyak directed us to an independent 2008 study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration.

In its report, titled ""Construction Grants Program Impact Assessment Report,"" Grant Thornton LLP, an audit, tax and advisory organization based in Chicago, updated and improved on a 1997 EDA study performed by a team of Rutgers and Princeton university economists.

The study concluded that ""EDA's strategic focus on innovation and entrepreneurship makes sense, in that investments in business incubators generate significantly greater impacts in the communities in which they are made than do other project types.""

The majority of the literature we found on the subject supported the Grant Thornton study’s conclusions, and the field of business incubator press clippings are ripe with success stories. In 2000, for instance, The Los Angeles Business Journal  reported that companies launched in incubators remained in business after five years 87 percent of the time, compared to only 20 percent of all new business start-ups reaching the five-year mark.

The advantages of incubators includes shared operating costs, consulting and administrative assistance, improved access to capital, legitimacy in the community, and the support of fellow entrepreneurs, according to the Reference for Business, the Encyclopedia of Small Business.

Conveniently, the National Business Incubation Association is headquartered in Athens, Ohio. Over the past year, Brown has trumpeted EDA grants of more than $12 million for Ohio start-up businesses and incubators, including JumpStart Inc. of Cleveland, Kent State University and the Community Improvement Corp. in Tuscarawas County, the city of Twinsburg, and the Barberton Community Development Corp.

Such local support for business incubators is vital, based on the Grant Thornton study’s findings that about 84 percent of incubator graduates establish their businesses within 20 miles of the incubator facility.

The study’s findings support Brown’s claims of ""nearly 70 local jobs"" generated per $10,000 EDA investment in business incubators. The exact range is 46.3 to 69.4 jobs per $10,000, which far out-distances jobs generated by other federal projects such as commercial structures (9.6 to 13.4 jobs generated), roads and other transportation (4.4 to 7.8), industrial park structures (5 to 7.3) and community infrastructure (1.5 to 3.4).

The study concludes that money spent on business incubators appears to have the largest correlation with future economic growth. ""In this context, it can be seen that EDA’s strategic emphasis over the last several years of entrepreneurship makes sense in terms of its jobs figures.""

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Brown’s claim as True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/03/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-touts-business-incubators-job-cr/
"['Health Care', 'Labor', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Jennifer  Shilling']","
Wisconsin Rep. Jennifer Shilling says many local governments require employees to pay more than 20 percent of their health insurance premiums
","
It’s hard to imagine any group of public employees in Wisconsin having a sweeter deal on health insurance costs than city employees in Madison.

Most make no payment toward their insurance premiums and are in plans that require no co-pays and have no deductibles.

So Madison wasn’t cited by state Rep. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse) when she blistered Gov. Scott Walker’s controversial budget-repair bill.

The measure would require workers to pay more of the costs of pensions and health care, effectively forcing them to take a pay cut. One of Walker’s justifications for trying to sharply curtail public sector collective bargaining rights in the process is to give local units of government the same opportunity to impose similar costs on their employees.

In turn, that money could be used to offset reductions in state aid in the two-year budget starting July 1, 2011. Walker has said state employees should pay 12.6 percent of their health insurance premiums.

Shilling called Walker’s argument false and ""ridiculous"" because, she said, many local government already get more than that from employees.

""The truth is, local school districts and municipalities that have been requiring employees to pay for health and pension benefit costs are going to be hit hard by Walker’s cuts,"" Shilling, a member of the Legislature’s budget-reviewing Joint Finance Committee, said in a Feb. 27, 2011 news release.

She added: ""Walker claims municipalities will be able to force employees to pay 12 percent of their health insurance premiums, but many cities already require employees to pay 20, 30, or even 40 percent of their health insurance premiums.""

Now, that’s a big number and, potentially, a big development.

We’re going to tackle Schilling’s statement with this caveat: We’re not looking in this item at the assumptions Walker and his budget crunchers  used to calculate the prospective savings for local government. We’re looking at whether many school districts and cities already make employees pay between 20 percent and 40 percent of health care costs.

We asked Shilling for backup on her claim.

Her legislative aide, Anthony Palese, pointed us to a survey of school district cost-sharing on health insurance, conducted annually by the Wisconsin Association of School Boards.

That annual survey showed that only 6 of the 130 school districts that responded are asking for more than 12 percent in premiums on family coverage.  The average: 4 percent.

Only one district, Abbotsford, fell into the 20 percent to 40 percent range that Shilling claims is common -- the district asks 46 percent of employees on family plans. The district pays more in salaries than nearby districts, said district administrator Reed Welsh.

But the current year data is not complete, in part because many contracts are still unsettled. So let’s take a look back to the previous year’s survey.

In the 2009-10 survey, the schools association found that out of 388 districts, the average ask from employees was 5 percent.

Only 14 districts were getting more than the 12 percent benchmark set by the governor.

Only five of the 388 fell into the wider range -- 20 percent to 40 percent -- that Shilling outlined.

We noticed a possible explanation for Shilling’s belief that ""many"" local units were already getting more than that 12 percent: there were two school districts in western Wisconsin -- Onalaska and Holmen -- that got 20 percent from employees in 2009-’10. 
The city of Onalaska also receives 20 percent from its employees.

Both communities are near La Crosse and Shilling’s district. So her perspective on it may be skewed.

In her statement, Shilling also referred to ""municipalities"" already charging employees similar amounts.

There is no equivalent annual survey of cities, and Shilling’s staff could point to none asking 20 to 40 percent, as contended.

We sampled a few big cities.

Madison: The city’s no-cost insurance option, selected by most full-time union workers there, is one end of the scale -- and nowhere near 20 percent to 40 percent.

La Crosse: City workers in the family plan pay 3.1 percent if they undergo a health assessment, which almost all do. Single people pay about 12 percent.

Milwaukee: City workers -- union or nonunion -- pay 3 percent to 8 percent in the family plan if they do the wellness tests.

Wausau: Workers pay 10 percent with a co-pay only for emergency room visits.

That 10 percent in Wausau is pretty typical, according to the labor union that represents municipal employees in nearly 600 bargaining units across Wisconsin.

Most full-time employees in those locales now pay about 10 percent of their premiums, up significantly in the last decade, said Jack Bernfeld, associate director, AFSCME Wisconsin Council 40.

So, what’s the bottom line?

Shilling contended that Walker was misguided in claiming that communities had a lot of room for savings by getting employees to kick in more of health insurance costs because ""many"" already get double or even triple what Walker is asking.

But the school data she points to shows that’s true in only a tiny scattering of districts. In cities, 10 percent is typical, and Shilling could name only one city in the 20 to 40 percent range.

"['Education', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says state's public school spending increased 82 percent in decade
","
Gov. Rick Perry says the state’s public schools are improving -- in part, he suggested, because state aid is way up. ""Over the past decade,"" Perry said in his Feb. 8 State of the State address, ""the state’s share of public education spending increased from $11 billion per year to $20 billion in ‘09. That’s an 82 percent increase.""

Our first pass at his analysis proved a snap after reaching the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters. Its staff spokesman, John Barton, said the board shared spending figures with Perry before his speech. Separately, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed us to a chart showing that in 2000, state aid totaled around $10 billion and the board’s 2008-09 ""Fiscal Size-up"" projected the aid to be about double that in 2009.

Barton said the state spent $11.1 billion on public education aid in 2000. According to LBB staff, the state spent $20.3 billion on such aid in 2009--$9.2 billion, or 84 percent, more than before.

What drove the increase? More students, for starters. Texas public schools served more than 4.8 million students in 2008-09, the Texas Education Agency says -- 20 percent more than in 1998-99.

What else? School finance expert and lobbyist Lynn Moak, whose clients include a consortium of the state’s largest school districts, said other factors that boosted state aid between 1998-99 and 2008-09 included legislated increases in teacher pay and health care coverage, supported by increasing local tax revenue driven by surging property values.

Moak said another major factor driving state aid was the 2006 decision by GOP lawmakers and Perry to mandate lower school property taxes and make up the difference in lost revenue going forward. According to LBB research, nearly $18.6 billion in state aid went to the schools in 2008 compared with $12.1 billion in 2006, before the tax swap took effect. Meanwhile, local funds spent on public education dropped slightly to $18.2 billion in 2008, compared with $19.9 billion in 2006. All told, school spending (from federal, state and local funds) amounted to nearly $41 billion in 2008.

But school districts in 2008-09 also had more money to spend per pupil, according to TEA calculations included in year-by-year pocket guides to school statistics. In 1998-99, operating expenditures averaged $5,668 per pupil. Adjusting for inflation, that amount would have been about $6,720 by 2008-09. The actual per-pupil operating expenditure was $8,572, the TEA says. 
The guides reminded us of another way to size up state spending on public education: by comparing it to the total spent from all sources, meaning local, state and federal funds. According to the guides, the state picked up 46 percent of school districts’ spending in 1998-99. That share was less than 43 percent in 2008-09. During Perry’s decade as governor, the state’s portion hit a low of 34 percent in 2005-06 and a high of 45 percent in 2007-08.

So, the state spent 84 percent more money in 2008-09 than before and per-student spending from all funding sources also was higher. Yet the state’s share of education spending -- a telling indicator of state support for the schools -- was down from what it was a decade earlier.

We contacted Perry’s office about these aspects. Frazier said the governor stands behind his speech statement.

Gov. Rick Scott says high-speed rail jobs won't last long
","
Florida Gov. Rick Scott made time during his two-day promotional tour of northern U.S. cities on March 2, 2011, to stop into New York's Fox News studios and talk high-speed rail.

In an interview with Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy, Scott first brushed off a lawsuit filed by two state senators challenging the new governor's ability to unilaterally kill the project. ""I represent the taxpayers,"" he said. ""This doesn't make any sense."" Doocy then asked if a high-speed train is ""really what people need."" But before Scott could answer, Doocy said the project would provide jobs, right?  

""Short-term jobs,"" Scott said. ""The federal government gives you all this money and then you have to pay for it down the road.""

In a previous item, we checked a claim from U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Jacksonville, that the rail line from Tampa to Orlando would create 60,000 jobs and rated that False. This time, we wanted to drill down on Scott's assertion that the jobs created would be ""short-term jobs.""

For starters, we should note that estimating job numbers is a little bit like estimating ridership figures when it comes to the Tampa-Orlando train. There is science to it, of course, but there is a bit of art, too.

Nevertheless, the Florida Department of Transportation provided a detailed job-creation estimate (page 16) as part of its application to the federal government for high-speed rail funding in October 2009. The state was awarded $2.4 billion in federal money for the $2.7 billion project, the money that Scott rejected.

The job estimates are spread out over the four-county area along the 84-mile high-speed line, covering Hillsborough, Polk, Orange and Osceola counties. The 2009 application was based on a four-year construction period, beginning in 2011, and broke down the jobs created into three basic categories -- construction, engineering services and operations/maintenance. The estimate includes direct jobs -- those directly hired as a result of the project -- and indirect jobs, which FDOT said are jobs created to support the suppliers of the materials and equipment to the project.

FDOT concluded that the rail line would create a total of 48,800 direct and indirect jobs over the construction of the system and another 1,100 total jobs once the line is in operation. (FDOT predicted the line would start running in 2015.)

The jobs are measured in job-years, which is different than how most people would classify a job. The idea is that a ""job"" equals a year someone is employed -- that's a job-year. It could be one person working a year, or two people working six months each, or some other combination. In counting job-years, FDOT adds each year's job total to create one big number.

It's a perfectly valid calculation -- as long as you understand the difference -- but to many, it comes off as a way to inflate the impact of a project.

Here's how the FDOT breaks down the job creation in job-years:
  

After 2015, FDOT says, the operations and maintenance jobs would continue (600 direct, 1,100 total) while the construction-related work would not.

In the most favorable light, that's a total of roughly 50,000 job-years spread out over five years, with 1,100 of those jobs continuing in perpetuity. But 40,500 of those jobs -- more than 80 percent -- are confined to just two years during the rail construction, 2012 and 2013.

Scott said the high-speed rail project provides ""short-term jobs."" He's largely right. More than 80 percent of the jobs created (talking job-years again) only exist for two years, and 98 percent of the jobs last no more than four years while the rail's being built. That leaves just 1,100 direct and indirect jobs created as a result of the operation of the train that are truly permanent.

"['Labor', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says Wisconsin is broke
","
Republicans from Washington to Madison have adopted a new expression when it comes to describing the state of government finances: ""We’re broke.""

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker started using the ""broke"" description as he unveiled his controversial budget-repair bill, which would force state employees to pay more for health care and pensions and curtail collective bargaining rights for most public employees.

""I don't have anything to negotiate,"" Walker said Feb. 11, 2011, the day he unveiled his budget-repair bill, aimed at closing a $137 million gap in the budget that ends June 30, 2011. ""We are broke in this state. We have been broke for years.""

Since then, he’s repeated the phrase many times.

""The bottom line is we are trying to balance our budget and there really is no room to negotiate on that because we’re broke,"" Walker said Feb. 21, 2011 on ABC’s ""Good Morning America.""
""
At a news conference that day, he said: ""We’re broke. We don’t have any more money.""

He added: ""We have a $3.6 billion budget deficit (for the next two years). You can’t really negotiate if you don’t have any money to negotiate with.""

In his March 1, 2011 budget speech, the governor said: ""The facts are clear: Wisconsin is broke and it’s time to start paying our bills today – so our kids are not stuck with even bigger bills tomorrow.""

Walker, of course, has promised not to turn to one conventional tool the state has available to make ends meet -- raising taxes. That’s a political decision and one we are not focused on in this item. Rather, we’re focusing on the language Walker and supporters are using to describe the state’s finances and to persuade taxpayers that his solutions are best.

Since the ""broke"" description has become so common, we decided to look at exactly what it means and whether it is an accurate description of Wisconsin’s financial state.

Let’s start with some dictionary definitions:

Broke: having no money; bankrupt.

Broke: without money; penniless.

Broke: Synonyms: bankrupt, beggared, bust, cleaned out, destitute, dirt poor, flat broke , impoverished, in Chapter 11, in debt, indebted, indigent, insolvent, needy, penniless, penurious, poor, ruined, stone broke, strapped, tapped out.

We’ll add a more conversational use: ""I’m broke. Can you buy this round of beers?""

Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said the governor was referring to $58.7 million plus interest owed to Minnesota under a discontinued tax-reciprocity deal and at least $200 million owed to the Patients Compensation Fund after a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision said former Gov. Jim Doyle’s administration  illegally tapped into the fund.

Werwie also cited the ""Medicaid deficit"", the ""corrections deficit"" and ""other things out there."" The state, he said, has been running ""massive structural deficits for years.""

in earlier items, we found the deficit in the budget ending June 30, 2011, is real and rated False a claim that the $3.6 billion deficit projected for the next two fiscal years is a ""bogus"" number.

Walker wants to close the current deficit with a combination of debt restructuring and changes that would affect most public employees -- including limiting collective bargaining rights to only wages, and then only within limits. The outcry over that provision stirred the huge protests in Madison, the walkout by Democrats in the state Senate, and numerous efforts by Walker and Republicans to explain their position.

The Republican explanation has been that Walker’s ""budget-repair bill"" includes modest requests of state employees and brings their benefit contributions in line with private sector workers. And it’s continued: The state has no choice....because we’re broke.

To be sure, some local governments have gone belly up, but not many.

The Wall Street Journal’s David Wessel reported in fall of 2010 that fewer than 250 of the nation’s 89,000 government units have filed for bankruptcy since 1980.

""Recent close calls in Harrisburg, Pa., and Central Falls, R.I., spark predictions that the next phase of the financial crisis will be a tsunami of municipal bankruptcies and defaults,"" Wessel wrote. ""Muni-bond experts at rating agencies and bankruptcy lawyers assure us that isn't likely.""

He added: ""After Vallejo, Calif., won a federal judge's OK to use Chapter 9 in 2008 to extricate itself from union contracts, there were widespread predictions that other cities would follow.
‘Two and a half years later that hasn't been the case,’ says Robert Kurtter, who oversees state and local government ratings at Moody's Investors Service.""

In an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Kurtter said few municipalities have filed for bankruptcy because it’s a long, complicated and expensive process with uncertain outcomes. In addition, states are prohibited from filing bankruptcy under federal law.

A columnist for Governing magazine addressed the issue in fall of 2010.

""There may be talk about governments being bankrupt and insolvent when what is meant is, ‘We don't want to raise taxes and don't want to spend so we have to cut.’"" Penelope Lemov wrote in the article.

Meanwhile, in January 2011, Moody’s issued a national report that combined state debt and pension liabilities. Moody’s studies and rates debt issued by governments and corporations, and its ratings can affect how much those issuing bonds will have to pay in interest.

The report says that combining those obligations makes it easier to compare the fiscal health of states. Those with the highest ratings have the most serious debt burdens, which makes them less appealing to investors.

Wisconsin’s rating was 37th as measured by the amount of debt per capita, 38th (debt by GDP) 39 (by personal income) and 41 (by revenue).

""States’ liability rankings versus revenue or economic measures tend to be indicative of the nature of risks these states carry in funding their obligations over the long term,"" the report says.

So according to the Moody’s debt ranking, Wisconsin fares well when compared with other states. That’s one measure of the state’s fiscal health.

We asked a few local experts about the use of the term ""broke"" to describe the state of Madison’s finances:

Andrew Reschovsky, a UW-Madison professor of public affairs and finance, said use of the term didn’t make sense when it comes to the state’s financial situation.

""That’s obviously absurd,"" Reschovsky said. ""We obviously aren’t broke. The analogy to a household is really a fallacious one.""

He said the government has powerful tools at its disposal to make ends meet: taxes or manipulating fees. You could also put off some spending or shift some debt into the next fiscal year -- tricks that state budget offices have routinely used.

Walker has taken tax increases off of the table. He proposed in his budget-repair bill to  restructure the state’s debt, pushing some payments off into the future.

""For the amount of money that we’re talking about there’s a wide range of things that could be done,"" Reschovsky said.  

The $137 million deficit in the budget year ending June 30 represents about 0.456 percent of the $30 billion state budget, or less than half of 1 percent. The projected $3.6 billion deficit for the next two-year budget is more serious: about 12 percent of the overall budget.

Connie Kilmark, owner of a Madison firm that consults people in financial trouble, said of Walker’s ""broke"" rhetoric: ""It’s just not true. He’s trying to scare us all.""

The state has taxing power, and revenue is continuing to flow in -- both key factors in making ends meet, she said. As the economic recovery continues, tax revenue is expected to actually rise $1.5 billion in the next two-year period, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.

Claire Ann Resop, a Madison attorney who handles bankruptcies and reviews other bankruptcy cases filed in that part of the state, said ""broke"" is measured by whether or not you can pay your bills. Said Resop: ""I haven’t heard that they’ve been defaulting.""

That said, some of the bills are due. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, for instance, has expressed impatience with Wisconsin’s delays on repayment, saying in January that Wisconsin should pay up immediately.

Ken King, of the Family Service Association in Sheboygan, which runs a consumer credit counseling center, said, ""When you have nothing to draw on anymore, you’re broke.""

Ralph Anzivino, a Marquette University Law School professor who teaches bankruptcy law, said, ""Broke is a lay term, a street term.""

He said it would be more accurate to say that the state was insolvent but has options at its disposal to put its house in order. They include: raising taxes, laying off workers and cutting costs or finding other savings.

Then there is this perspective from within state government itself.

""The state is no more broke than it was two, four or 10 years ago,"" said Frank Hoadley, capital finance director with the state Department of Administration.

""There’s always a huge gap"" as budget deliberations begin, he said. ""And it always gets hammered out.""

In unveiling his two-year budget, Walker cut aid to local schools and government by about $1 billion. But the proposal, which now goes to the Legislature, included new spending in some areas, including adding $1 million in raises for prosecutors, $993,800 for additional public defenders and $1.04 million to investigate Internet crimes against children.

On the opposite side of the ledger, the budget reduced revenue by some $140 million through a variety of tax cuts, including ones aimed at businesses and individuals with Health Savings Accounts.

Finally, we took the question to Wall Street and the experts at Moody’s, who are hired by the state to study and rate its debt. A Moody’s panel, including Kurtter, one of the most respected municipal finance experts in the country, discussed Wisconsin’s dilemma and Walker’s assertion and made these observations: 
""This is not a problem that’s isolated in Wisconsin,"" said Kimberly Lyons, a Moody’s analyst.

Kurtter noted that Wisconsin faces unique challenges because the state does not have a reserve or ""rainy day"" fund.

The state’s ""budget stabilization fund"" had an average balance of $1.685 million in January, according to Robert Lang, director of the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. That supports a budget that has a $14 billion in general fund spending.

Kurtter said Wall Street will look at several factors when deciding how much risk Wisconsin presents to future investors. They include: whether or not a budget is adopted, whether it closes the shortfall, and whether it does it in a ""structural way,"" that is long-term.

So, let’s review.

Walker and other Republicans say the state is broke, so broke that there’s no money, and because there’s no money, they are unwilling to negotiate over the terms of the budget-repair bill.

Experts agree the state faces financial challenges in the form of deficits. But they also agree the state isn’t broke. Employees and bills are being paid. Services are continuing to be performed. Revenue continues to roll in. A variety of tools -- taxes, layoffs, spending cuts, debt shifting -- is available to make ends meet. Walker has promised not to increase taxes. That takes one tool off the table. Another tool was never there: declaring bankruptcy. We’re not broke or bankrupt in part because under federal law we can’t be.

"['Rhode Island', 'Children', 'Crime', 'Peter  Palumbo']","
Palumbo says there are 500,000 registered sex offenders in U.S. and 100,000 are unaccounted for
","
For several years, state Rep. Peter G. Palumbo has worked to revise the way Rhode Island registers and monitors convicted sex offenders. This year he introduced legislation to consolidate the state’s sex offender registry under the supervision of the state police and revamp it to comply with federal guidelines.

A General Assembly news release announcing the new bill cites the reason such legislation is needed, attributing the statement to Palumbo:  ""Across the nation, there are nearly 500,000 registered sex offenders and at any one time about 100,000 of them are unaccounted for. As long as there is one sex offender out there that we cannot account for, there is the potential for great harm, the potential for another victim.""

We wondered if that many sex offenders were really missing, so we asked Palumbo where he got those figures. He cited one source: The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, a nonprofit based in Alexandria, Va. According to its annual report, the center was created by Congress in 1984, following the highly publicized disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz in New York City.

The center created a national missing children’s hot line and serves as a clearinghouse for information on missing and exploited children. It also collects data twice a year from every state on registered sex offenders.

Carolyn Atwell-Davis, the center’s director of legislative affairs, says the group arrives at its figures by calling law enforcement officials in each state and requesting the totals. It uses the information to periodically publish a national map showing the number of registered sex offenders in each state. Using similar data, and what it calls conservative estimates, the center tallies offenders who are unaccounted for.

Atwell-Davis said the number of registered sex offenders, based on the most recent survey, in December, is actually 728,435 -- 46 percent more than the number Palumbo cited.
Atwell-Davis said the last time the total number of sex offenders nationally was close to 500,000 was about 2002.

The group’s estimate of the number of unaccounted for is 100,000 -- a number that hasn’t changed in years.

NCMEC receives nearly $50 million annually in government grants and charitable contributions to fight child pornography, track sex offenders, maintain a missing children’s hot line and train police and prosecutors.  Its data on sex offenders are cited routinely by politicians and the Justice Department.

Because Palumbo’s underlying point is that a substantial number of registered sex offenders is missing, we decided to examine that premise.

First, we checked Rhode Island, where the sex offender registry lists 569 offenders. Of that total, 119 are so-called Level 3 offenders, who have been convicted of sexual assaults, child molestation or kidnapping a minor. Ten of those were identified as being deported, moved out of state, incarcerated out of state or whereabouts unknown.

Another  225 are so-called Level 2 offenders, those who had committed less serious felony sex offenses. A total of 12 were identified as whereabouts unknown.

So, 22 of the 569 registered offenders in Rhode Island are unaccounted for -- about 4 percent.

We checked with some neighbors. One problem is that many use different criteria in entering offenders on their registries.

Connecticut, for instance, does not have tiers of offenders.  All are lumped together, for a total of 5,279. Rather than having various categories of missing, public information officer Lt. Paul  Vance says the state uses a category of ""not in compliance."" That includes everyone from those who haven’t supplied their addresses to those who have fled. The total is 372 or about 7  percent.

New York State identifies 31,972 offenders in three tiers. But only 490 are identified as location unknown. That is 1.5 percent of the total.

Massachusetts has a total of 8,166 registered sex offenders. Those who haven’t properly registered or who are otherwise unaccounted for are termed violators. As of Wednesday, there were 227 violators - or less than 3 percent.

We aren’t the only ones wondering about NCMEC’s numbers.

Jill Levenson, chairwoman of the Department of Human Services at Lynn University, in Boca Raton, Fla., has been studying sexual offender registries, with other researchers from the University of Massachusetts, the University of California and the New Jersey Department of Corrections. She disagrees with the number of 100,000 ""missing"" offenders reported by NCMEC. Levenson said the highest number her group could determine was 17,688.

""When they (NCMEC) say missing, part of the question is what does that mean?"" said Levenson. She said her group found many of the ""missing"" were homeless, in transit or simply the result of data entry errors.  A study of the Florida registry found nearly a third of the people listed had died, moved or been deported.

Levenson said she feels it’s important to make the proper data available so that resources may be allocated most efficiently to deal with social problems such as sexual offenses. She argues the current emphasis on ""publicly identifying and tracking known offenders may do a disservice to the public, since over 90 percent of sexually abused children are victimized by someone well known to them with no previous sex crime record, not a stranger found on a registry.""

We asked Atwell-Davis about Levenson’s conclusions.

As for the missing offenders, Atwell-Davis said, ""We’ve always said that was an estimate and that it was conservative."" She said several studies suggest the true number is higher.

For example, she said she believes California is missing 20 percent of its offenders. The official figures from California, as of March 1, are 71,803 registered offenders, with 17,544 in violation of the registration law. That is 24 percent.

Atwell-Davis said she believes the discrepancy is due to the fact that Levenson gets her figures from public registries while NCMEC gets data directly from law enforcement agencies in each state and territory.

""We don’t want to create fear where it is unnecessary,"" said Atwell-Davis. ""We believe it is important for communities to have good information.""

So where are we?

* The 500,000 figure Palumbo cites for the total number of sex offenders in the United States was, by NCMEC’s count, off by more than 228,000. The last time it was 500,000 was nine years ago.

* If NCMEC’s numbers are accurate, the ratio of unaccounted for sex offenders nationwide is 1 of 7, not the 1 of 5 Palumbo’s statement suggests.

* NCMEC’s numbers are in dispute. A team of academics says they’re substantially overstated. Data from Rhode Island and nearby states supports that view.

Clearly, when even one registered sex offender is missing, that’s a serious problem -- a problem Palumbo is trying to fix. But public officials owe it to their constituents to get the facts right when they’re trying to address such issues.

Palumbo’s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- the PolitiFact definition for Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/03/peter-palumbo/palumbo-says-there-are-500000-registered-sex-offen/

Rail proponent says high-speed rail creates 60,000 jobs
","
Critics of Florida Gov. Rick Scott's refusal of $2.4 billion in federal money for high-speed rail often knock his decision for its apparent hypocrisy: Shutting down the project will cost tens of thousands of jobs, they say, a move that goes against the governor's oft-referenced No. 1 priority.

One pro-rail member of Congress, Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Jacksonville, put the jobs estimate higher than any projection we've seen -- about three times as high.

""We are going to continue to work for those 60,000-plus jobs for Floridians,"" Brown told Orlando's WESH-TV on Feb. 17, 2011, the day after Scott announced his intent to reject the money. ""With unemployment at 12 percent, we've just got to work this out for the people of Florida."" Brown made the 60,000-jobs claim in several news releases, and repeated the figure on March 1 in comments from the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Is Scott turning his back on 60,000 jobs -- a little less than 10 percent of the 700,000 jobs he promised to create -- by nixing the Tampa-to-Orlando high-speed rail line?

To find out, we turned to the Florida Department of Transportation, which has managed the state's high-speed rail plan since 1991.

FDOT's application for federal rail money included predicted economic benefits to the Tampa-Orlando corridor, including the creation of 23,600 direct jobs, like construction and design, and 26,300 indirect jobs, like those created for equipment suppliers.

FDOT calculated these jobs in something called ""job-years,"" which, in short, refers to the number of jobs that will be funded each year.

Job-years are not how you'd probably think of a job. So let us explain.

In the first year of rail construction, 2011, FDOT estimated the project would require a total of 2,100 construction workers and an additional 700 workers providing engineering services. Another 3,400 spinoff workers would be created in the first year, FDOT estimated. That's a total of 6,200 jobs.

Construction would then ramp up in 2012 -- ballooning the work force from 6,200 to 21,600, an increase of 15,400 workers.

On the surface, most people would say the rail project created jobs for 21,600 people -- some having a job for one year, others having a job for two. But in ""job-years,"" the actual number is 27,800. Here's how FDOT comes up that: They start with the 6,200 jobs from 2011, then add the 21,600 jobs from 2012.

The number of jobs created in the final two years of construction decreases. In 2013, a total of 18,900 direct and indirect jobs would be needed to service the construction of the rail line. In 2014, the number drops to 2,100.

A report by the Central Florida Partnership, an Orlando-area economic development group, explained it more bluntly: peak rail employment would occur between fall 2012-14 and require about 10,000 workers. That excludes indirect jobs.

After the rail line is up and running, FDOT said it will create 600 permanent jobs to operate the 84-mile line and 500 permanent spinoff jobs.

In the most optimistic terms, that's 49,900 ""job-years"" created over a five-year window, including 1,100 permanent jobs.

That's short of 60,000 -- the figure cited by Brown -- and that's without even factoring in the jobs vs. job-years part of the claim. Really, the best way to look at the rail project is to say that it would employ directly or indirectly 6,200 workers in 2011, 21,600 workers in 2012, 18,900 workers in 2013, 2,100 workers in 2014 and then 1,100 workers thereafter. But to count job-years, FDOT is adding each year's job count to one big number: 49,900.

David Simon, a spokesman for Brown, said he has seen different job numbers for the high-speed rail project, and was not sure where Brown got her 60,000-job figure. He believed it may have come from the state, but noted that the state's high-speed rail website has been taken down and is no longer accessible.

Whatever the number, he said, people should be asking Scott why he wants to kill the jobs created by the high-speed rail project.

Maybe so. But we're here simply to examine Brown's numbers.

In the media, in press releases, and on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, Brown said the Tampa-to-Orlando high-speed rail project would create 60,000 jobs. That number is too high. In reality, the project would create construction and construction spinoff jobs for parts of four years. The number of the jobs varies depending on the year of construction, but peaks at a total of 21,600 jobs in the second year of work. Once the high-speed rail line is operational, the state anticipates the creation of 1,100 permanent direct and indirect jobs.

Yes, the project creates jobs. But not to the extent Brown suggests. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2011/mar/02/corrine-brown/rail-proponent-says-high-speed-rail-creates-60000-/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'State Budget', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Deval Patrick']","
Deval Patrick said the Massachusetts health care law added 1 percent to the state budget.
","
Massachusetts overhauled its health care laws in 2006 to work toward universal coverage. Many consider it a model for national health care reform -- even critics, who say that Massachusetts’ problems with cost controls mean the national plan will have similar problems.

But Deval Patrick, the Democratic governor of the state, said the cost overruns aren’t as dramatic as some are claiming, when asked about it on This Week with Christiane Amanpour.

""Actually, it's added about 1 percent to our state budget, which is not what is generally reported on out there, but that is the truth,"" Patrick said.

Patrick added that the plan in Massachusetts was to cover the uninsured and then address cost controls. ""And just as we have shown the nation how to provide universal care through a public-private model, I think we can crack the code on health care costs as well,"" he said.

Patrick promoted his own plan for reducing costs by paying doctors and hospitals for healthy outcomes, not per procedure.

We were interested in fact-checking Patrick’s statement that the 2006 Massachusetts health care law, signed by then-Gov. Mitt Romney, had added only 1 percent to the state budget.

We contacted Patrick’s office but didn’t hear back. Meanwhile, we tracked the claim back to a report from the Massachusetts Taxpayers’ Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research group backed by business that regularly analyzes state fiscal issues.

A report published in 2009 found that the state’s share of health care spending increased by $353 million in fiscal year 2010. The state’s entire budget is roughly $30 billion, so that comes out to about 1 percent, said Michael Widmer, the group’s president. He said the group has not updated the analysis with more recent numbers but has seen nothing to indicate the trend is any different.

There’s some fine print to explain about the group’s analysis, though. The foundation arrived at its number by adding health care spending increases for expanding coverage. But it also subtracted money the state would have spent under the old system on care for the uninsured and the state’s old Medicaid program.

An analysis by Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute in 2009 took issue with the study’s focus solely on the state budget. The federal government significantly increased Medicaid aid to Massachusetts as a result of the new law. Additionally, businesses and individuals had to spend more on insurance to satisfy new requirements that everyone have health insurance.

Widmer of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation agreed that the federal government did pay more money for the Massachusetts health plan. Also, some of the uninsured also paid for care that the state paid for before, he said.

""That’s why the piece around the state budget has always been modest,"" Widmer said.""We’re not trying to pretend it didn’t cost any additional money to insure 400,000 additional people.""

Patrick said his state’s health care law ""added about 1 percent to our state budget,"" and an independent analysis confirms that. There were additional costs for the health care plan outside of the state budget, so Patrick was right as far as the state budget goes. But because it's only one piece of a picture that includes increased federal spending, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/02/deval-patrick/deval-patrick-said-massachusetts-health-care-law-a/
"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Obama Birth Certificate', 'Mike Huckabee']","
Mike Huckabee said Barack Obama grew up in Kenya
","
Mike Huckabee, a potential Republican candidate for president, mused on President Barack Obama’s upbringing when asked about it on a radio talk show on Monday.

The host, Steve Malzberg, complained that people don’t know enough about Obama’s background and brought up Obama’s birth certificate.

""Don't you think we deserve to know more about this man?"" Malzberg asked Huckabee.

We should note that back in 2008, Obama’s presidential campaign produced a certificate of live birth, showing that Obama was born in Honolulu. Hawaiian public officials said the certificate was accurate. (Read our many fact-checks on Obama’s birth certificate.)

Huckabee answered Malzberg with this statement: ""I would love to know more. What I know is troubling enough. And one thing that I do know is his having grown up in Kenya, his view of the Brits, for example, very different than the average American. When he gave the bust back to the Brits, the bust of Winston Churchill, a great insult to the British. But then if you think about it, his perspective as growing up in Kenya with a Kenyan father and grandfather, their view of the Mau Mau Revolution in Kenya is very different than ours because he probably grew up hearing that the British were a bunch of imperialists who persecuted his grandfather.""

Huckabee here seems to be repeating claims made in book by conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza, The Roots of Obama’s Rage, that Obama is a committed anti-colonialist. An adaptation of D’Souza’s book ran in Forbes magazine back in September. The book has received mixed reactions in conservative circles, with both fans and detractors.

Obama did not grow up in Kenya and had almost no contact with his father growing up; he never met his grandfather. He grew up in Indonesia and Hawaii; numerous eye-witness reports have confirmed this. Classmates and teachers in Jakarta, Indonesia, and in Honolulu, Hawaii, have shared their recollections of Obama with independent reporters several times.

And in fact, Huckabee corrected his statement shortly thereafter.

""On Monday, while on Steve Malzberg's radio show on New York's WOR Radio, I was asked about the President Obama's birth certificate issue. In my answer, I simply misspoke when I alluded to President Obama growing up in 'Kenya' and meant to say Indonesia,"" said Huckabee in a statement on his website.

Huckabee’s initial comments were widely reported, though, because polls show he is a leading contender for the Republican nomination for president in 2012. Huckabee has not declared his candidacy and has said he’s still thinking it over.

It’s worth pointing out that Huckabee has said several times recently that he does not think Republicans are well-served by questioning Obama’s citizenship. On the Thursday before his radio appearance, Huckabee said at the National Press Club, ""I find it unnecessary, useless and frankly a bit unnecessary to get into all sorts of debates over President Obama's religion or the authenticity of his birth. I know for some people that it is an obsession. It is not with me.""

He said if Obama had not been born in the United States that it would have come out in the primary campaign and that Obama is a Christian.

Huckabee then praised Obama as a good role model for fathers: ""I have no disagreement with President Obama as a human being. In fact, I'll go so far to say one of the things I respect very much is the role model that he has served as a husband and a father. And I think he has been an exemplary husband to his wife and an extraordinary father to his daughters. Frankly, America needs a good role model like that.""

Huckabee emphasized that he disagreed with Obama’s policies. ""But this is not an attack on President Obama, the person, even though you will see sharp elbows at the policies that he has put forth, specifically, many of the economic policies,"" Huckabee said.

Huckabee did say in a radio interview that Obama grew up in Kenya and then spoke at length about the implications of that, suggesting that his views of the British were shaped by a father whom he only met once and a grandfather he never met.

But we should note that Huckabee quickly corrected the record and has notably rejected claims about Obama’s birth place that have been debunked repeatedly. We correct his statement on Kenya for the record here, since his comments have been widely reported, and rate it False.",/factchecks/2011/mar/02/mike-huckabee/mike-huckabee-said-barack-obama-was-born-kenya/
"['Ohio', 'Taxes', 'Jay Hottinger']","
Did Wendy's founder Dave Thomas really flee Ohio's estate tax on his death bed?
","
Opponents of Ohio's estate tax say it hurts the state by driving away wealthy residents.

State Rep. Jay Hottinger, a leader of the drive to repeal the tax in the General Assembly, said a ""shockingly high number"" of Ohioans leave because of the tax. But, the Newark Republican acknowledged on the ""Sound of Ideas"" on WCPN 90.3 FM there is no actual number to cite.

""When an individual decides to leave my home community in Licking County, believe it or not, they don't take out a press release,"" he said. ""They don't send it to the news media and say, 'We're leaving the state of Ohio because we want to preserve our assets for our heirs.""

He pointed to individuals instead, naming the founder of Wendy's restaurants as one example.

""Dave Thomas left the state literally on his deathbed to avoid the estate tax,"" Hottinger said.

PolitiFact Ohio was stirred. We imagined a dramatic dash for the border in a souped-up medical van.

Wanting to know more, we called Hottinger's office for details. When they didn't get back to us, we searched on our own.

We found a less dramatic story.

Thomas died in 2002, after a decade-long battle with liver cancer, at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He had lived there since 1982, when he moved to Florida after retiring as CEO of Wendy’s at age 49. Prior to that, he had lived in Ohio for 20 years.

If his primary goal at that time of his move was to limit the tax exposure his estate would have after his death, he must have been pleasantly surprised to discover that he also gained the year-round ability to play golf (which he loved) and to cruise on his 90-foot yacht, the I. Lorraine (named for his wife), which he was able to dock behind his home.

A generous philanthropist, particularly in the interests of children's welfare, medicine and education, Thomas supported (and established) a number of organizations and causes in Florida, as he continued to do in Ohio and elsewhere.

He said his greatest regret was not finishing high school, and in 1993 he hired a tutor and passed the G.E.D. exam. Coconut Creek High School in Fort Lauderdale made him part of its senior class, and awarded his high school diploma. He and his wife were king and queen of the senior prom, and Thomas was voted ""Most Likely to Succeed.""

Legal residency is not something that can be established by deathbed conversion. Nor is it determined solely by physical presence.

The point is that Thomas, an adoptee who was born in New Jersey and moved constantly as a boy, spending significant periods in Michigan, Tennessee and Indiana, was no mere Florida visitor or latecomer. Though he still had Ohio homes at Buckeye Lake and in the Columbus suburb of Upper Arlington, he registered to vote in Florida, not as an absentee in Ohio, in 1988.

There’s also evidence that Thomas (who was survived by his wife, five children and 16 grandchildren) knew a thing or two about taxes, making us doubt that he would have left tax and estate planning to the eleventh hour.  

Gov. Bob Taft credited his support for getting passage of a $500 adoption credit on Ohio income taxes in 1999, and President Clinton gave him credit in 1996 for a federal law giving parents a one-time tax credit of $5,000 when they adopt a child.

There are other reasons to be skeptical of the claim about Thomas.

In examining claims about estate taxes elsewhere, PolitiFact Rhode Island found research reporting that estate taxes have little or no impact on the flow of people from one state to another.

The National Tax Journal in 2006 published ""State ‘Death’ Taxes and Elderly Migration -- The Chicken or the Egg?,"" whose authors found no evidence that the elderly were responding to changes in estate taxes. Kail Padquitt, staff economist for The Tax Foundation, a think tank that studies federal and state tax policies, told PolitiFact he hasn’t seen any proof that the prospect of paying estate taxes drives people to move.

And if all this wasn’t enough, there’s another key fact to consider.

Hottinger’s claim was that Thomas fled the state ""literally on his death bed, to avoid estate tax.""  That clearly isn’t the case, unless he lingered 20 years before passing. And at that, it would have been three years too soon.

Until 2005 (three years after Thomas’ death), Florida also had an estate tax.

Hottinger’s statement isn’t just inaccurate, it’s also ridiculous. On the Truth-O-Meter, it’s worthy of flame broiling. That’s why we rate it Pants On Fire.
