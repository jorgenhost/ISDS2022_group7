Has the FBI 'become America's secret police,' like the KGB?
","A Fox News legal commentator argued the FBI has become the new KGB, the Soviet-era secret police, during a segment of Hannity. Here’s the exchange between Gregg Jarrett and the show’s host, Sean Hannity, during the Dec. 6, 2017, edition: Jarrett: ""I think we now know that the (Robert) Mueller investigation is illegitimate and corrupt. And Mueller has been using the FBI as a political weapon. And the FBI has become America's secret police. Secret surveillance, wiretapping, intimidation, harassment and threats. It's like the old KGB that comes for you in the dark of the night banging through your door."" Hannity: ""By the way, this is not a game. This is not hyperbole you are using here."" Jarrett: ""No. Ask Paul Manafort, they came for him and broke through his front door."" Hannity: ""And if it can happen to him, Gregg…."" Jarrett: ""It can happen to all of us. Absolutely. The FBI is a shadow government now."" Are today’s FBI and yesterday’s KGB really interchangeable? Jarrett and Hannity said it wasn’t hyperbole. We checked with a range of experts in the history of both agencies, and even those who are no fans of past and present FBI practices say the comparison is wrongheaded. Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett The statement ""is over the top and ridiculous,"" said Douglas Charles, a historian at Penn State University Greater Allegheny and author of three books on the FBI, including J. Edgar Hoover and the Anti-interventionists: FBI Political Surveillance and the Rise of the Domestic Security State. ""And I say this as an FBI historian who has long been critical of the bureau's history, its political surveillance, its use of illegal wiretaps, its harassment of the LGBT community, and its promotion of ‘morality’ issues."" To be sure, some of the tactics Jarrett cited are used by the FBI, or more broadly by law enforcement agencies in the United States. The pre-dawn, break-down-the-door raid ordered at a house owned by Manafort -- President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman now under indictment on several counts involving his foreign lobbying business -- is not especially unusual. Such raids are more common in drug investigations than in white collar crime, according to Radley Balko, a criminal justice blogger for the Washington Post and author of Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America's Police Forces. Meanwhile, law enforcement has the ability to conduct warrantless wiretaps under certain circumstances, despite the longstanding opposition of civil liberties groups. A category of subpoena called a ""national security letter"" provides ""a law-enforcement officer with broad discretion or authority to search and seize unspecified places or persons,"" said John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org. National security letters have been used to trawl through ""customer records held by banks, telephone companies, Internet service providers, and others,"" who are then prevented from telling anyone about these searches, according to the Electronic Privacy Information Center. However, the use of such tools does not make the FBI, or any other U.S. law enforcement agency, the same as a secret police agency such as the old KGB. For one thing, those tactics sometimes may be needed. ""Breaking down front doors in the dark of night is a bit melodramatic, but it is probably necessary to avoid destruction of evidence,"" Pike said. (Preventing destruction of evidence was the reported justification for the Manafort raid.) ""Legitimate concerns about the increase in law enforcement’s surveillance capacity over the last decade or so are de-legitimized by such a specious pairing of agencies,"" said Victor E. Kappeler, a criminologist at Eastern Kentucky University and co-author of Policing in America and Homeland Security. Here are some of the reasons why any comparison between the two agencies is problematic. • Just because the FBI sometimes operates in secret does not mean that it’s a ""secret police."" ""By 'secret police,' we do not mean 'police activity that is secret' any more than by 'public interest' we mean 'what the public is interested in,' "" said Anthony Glees, director of the Center for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham and the author of The Stasi Files: The UK Operations of the East German Intelligence and Security Service. Indeed, the very fact that a legal analyst can criticize the FBI on a national television broadcast is a significant departure from anything that would be possible in a country with a true secret police. • The FBI is run by laws, not by whim. The KGB -- which translates from the Russian acronym for Committee for State Security -- answered to and served the interests of the Communist Party, not any system of law. Put simply, ""the FBI is subject to the laws limiting police powers,"" said Joseph Wippl, a former clandestine Central Intelligence Agency officer who now teaches at Boston University. ""These laws were passed by a Congress elected by the U.S. population. These laws can be changed, either restricting or expanding police powers."" Robert Mueller, the special counsel, ""needs to work within an independent judicial system to get search warrants and to indict suspects, whereas in the Soviet Union, there was generally no meaningful judicial oversight of the secret police,"" said Edward Cohn, a Grinnell College historian and author of The High Title of a Communist. ""And KGB efforts at intimidation and surveillance often went beyond anything the FBI is accused of doing."" Simon Ball, the chair of international history and politics at the University of Leeds and author of The Cold War: An International History 1947-1991, agreed. ""The contemporary U.S. political system and the Soviet political system of 1954, when the KGB was formed, are not comparable in any sensible analytical scheme,"" he said. • The FBI doesn’t torture or carry out extrajudicial executions. ""The KGB carried out the repression of a totalitarian state that murdered tens of millions of innocent people in the name of a political ideology,"" said Gregory Feifer a journalist and author of Russians: The People Behind the Power. ""Whatever one thinks about the FBI — with its many faults and occasional moves toward KGB-like surveillance of government critics over the years — it is an integral part of our rule-of-law society."" A secret police like the KGB operates ""through the institutionalised use of torture,"" Glees said. By contrast, ""any use of unnecessary violence, let alone torture, would be met with the full force of the criminal law."" Even as bad as the Hoover-era FBI was about civil liberties and abuse of power, Charles said, ""it was still no KGB-like organization coming for people in the dead of night who were then ‘disappeared.’ "" Indeed, he said, the excesses of Hoover’s tenure were, to a large extent, curbed after his death by the ordinary workings of the democratic process. Pike of globalsecurity.org said that, while there’s a need for vigilance, ""there does seem to have been a remarkable absence of abuses of these far-reaching powers."" He added, ""Whatever happens to you down at the J.Edgar Hoover building, you are pretty confident it will not entail a bullet to the back of the head."" A Fox News representative did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Jarrett said that ""the FBI has become America's secret police … ""The FBI has become America's secret police …  like the old KGB."" He also agreed with Hannity that the statement was not an exaggeration. Numerous historians of the FBI and the KGB say the comparison is ridiculous. The KGB implemented the goals of the Communist Party leadership, including countless examples of tortures and summary executions. The FBI, by contrast, is subject to the rule of law and is democratically accountable. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7DF780>],/factchecks/2017/dec/08/gregg-jarrett/has-fbi-become-americas-secret-police/

Ryan Sitton inaccurately says 12 million people left without homes by Hurricane Harvey
","A Texas official's guest editorial, shared on his campaign website, made us wonder about the whopping impact of Hurricane Harvey. Ryan Sitton, a Houston Republican on the Texas Railroad Commission, opened his Nov. 7, 2017, article in Drilling Contractor: ""Earlier this year, Hurricane Harvey left more than 12 million people in Texas and Louisiana without homes. The devastation of this storm was more far-reaching than anyone imagined."" That many people left homeless? That breaks out to an improbable 38 percent of the states’ combined populations. We sought Sitton’s elaboration; a state aide, Katie McKee, said by email that she’d typed the 12 million figure when she intended to write 1 million. McKee said that we’d brought the error to Sitton’s attention and a correction would be sought. Before we completed this fact-check, the version of his editorial on his campaign site had been amended to say 1 million; Drilling Contractor’s post still said 12 million. McKee told us Sitton intended to say the hurricane left more than 1 million people without homes, per a Sept. 8, 2017, CNN news story stating that after Harvey swirled over southeast Texas for several days, the ""storm and subsequent flooding left more than 70 people dead and ravaged nearly 300 miles of the Texas coast and parts of Louisiana, flooding homes and displacing more than a million people."" FEMA figures That story doesn’t say how CNN got to its million-plus figure. For our part, we fruitlessly hunted other news accounts estmating the number of Texas and Louisiana residents left homeless. Next, we turned to press releases issued by agencies including the Federal Emergency Management Agency starting after Harvey landed and wreaked havoc in late August and early September 2017. On Sept. 22, 2017, FEMA summed up Harvey’s punch: ""More than 19 trillion gallons of rainwater fell on parts of Texas, causing widespread, catastrophic flooding. Nearly 80,000 homes had at least 18 inches of floodwater, 23,000 of those with more than 5 feet."" That release further said: ""Nearly 780,000 Texans evacuated their homes. In the days after the storm, more than 42,000 Texans were housed temporarily in 692 shelters. Local, state and federal first responders rescued 122,331 people and 5,234 pets."" Also, the release said: ""The volume of applications for disaster assistance was one of the highest in FEMA history. To date, 792,000 households have applied for assistance."" (That figure was approaching 900,000 as of early December 2017.) So, per FEMA, nearly 780,000 Texas residents evacuated homes. Might that mean that many people were left without homes? A FEMA spokeswoman, Deanna Frazier, initially told us that the agency had ""no data on those left homeless as a result of the hurricane."" Frazier otherwise said the 792,000 figure in FEMA’s release reflected the number of Texas households that had filed requests by late September 2017 to receive grants for rental assistance, home repair, personal property replacement or direct housing (manufactured housing units or travel trailers). Estimating flood-hit homes Meantime, we noticed a Texas General Land Office press release, issued in December 2017, quoting the Texas land commissioner, George P. Bush, saying: ""Hurricane Harvey affected nearly 50,000 square miles of Texas and damaged or destroyed more than a million homes."" By email, Bush spokeswoman Brittany Eck attributed Bush’s ""more than a million homes"" to an earlier estimate of damaged or destroyed homes made by Gordon Wells, Ph.D., a research associate with the University of Texas Center for Space Research. Eck advised that when Harvey came ashore, Wells was ""embedded with the GLO for hurricane response at the State Operations Center run by the Texas Department of Emergency Management."" By phone, Wells told us he didn’t have an estimate of Texas residents left without homes by Harvey. But Wells said he estimated the extent of Harvey-caused flooding initially by geo-locating homes for which 338,829 flood insurance claims had been filed by early October 2017. Wells said that far more homes were flood-hit, however, considering that some 80-plus percent of homeowners and renters lacked flood coverage. ""If the figure of 339,829 affected structures represents the insured population of homeowners,"" Wells wrote, ""then the total number of impacted structures in the region would rise by a factor of five to nearly 1.7 million, including a large number with only minor water damage,"" Wells said. ""This is higher than my original estimate of 1 to 1.1 million affected structures estimated from the insurance data available in early September."" Wells cautioned too that he did not gauge the destructive results of the hurricane’s winds alone. ""The distribution of the insurance claims, widespread floodwater detected in satellite and aerial imagery and the tendency for homeowners not to insure their property for flood damage lead me to estimate that water damage of some degree occurred to over one million properties in Texas as a result of Hurricane Harvey and perhaps as many as 1.7 million properties based on the best available data,"" Wells wrote. Fewer Louisiana residents left without homes? Sharon Karr, a Louisiana-based FEMA spokeswoman, said the federal government issued a major disaster declaration in October 2017 for 20 of the state’s Harvey-affected parishes--including six bordering Texas, a FEMA map shows. Nine of the parishes, Karr said by email, became eligible for aid to remove debris and repair roads and bridges, water control facilities, public buildings and utilities, parks and other recreational facilities. By phone, though, Karr said FEMA did not authorize ""individual disaster assistance"" awards that could include housing assistance. We separately noticed that Louisiana’s September 2017 request for the disaster declaration said 312 residences in the state were ""impacted""  by the hurricane, including 19 ""destroyed"" residences and 48 with ""major damage."" We also reached Mike Steele of the Louisiana Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, who said by phone the state doesn’t have a tracking system to tally displaced residents after a disaster. Karr and Steele each suggested we elicit detail about residents left without homes from preparedness officials in Calcasieu Parish. Our attempts to do so didn’t succeed. Our ruling Sitton wrote: ""Earlier this year, Hurricane Harvey left more than 12 million people in Texas and Louisiana without homes."" This figure, attributed to a typo, is improbably high. We also didn’t spot an authoritative alternate count though it seems reasonable to say--based on requests for help through FEMA and a state expert’s review rooted in flood insurance claims--that more than a million Texas residents sustained home damage. It looks to us like the hurricane left far fewer Louisianans without homes. We rate Sitton's published claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

No, Roy Moore accuser didn't admit she forged his signature in her yearbook
","A conspiracy-minded website attempted to cast doubt on evidence presented by one of eight women who accused Roy Moore of sexual misconduct in a misleading headline days ahead of the Alabama Senate race. ""WE CALLED IT! Gloria Allred Accuser **ADMITS** She Tampered With Roy Moore’s Yearbook ‘Signature’ (VIDEO),"" the headline reads on The Gateway Pundit. We found similar posts on Breitbart, ""Roy Moore Accuser Beverly Nelson Admits She Forged Yearbook,"" and on the blog Silence is Consent, ""Roy Moore accuser admits she forged yearbook inscription."" Beverly Young Nelson accused Roy Moore of groping her when she was 16 years old and he, in his 30s, was the deputy district attorney of Etowah County. As evidence, Nelson presented a note she said Moore wrote in her high school yearbook before the incident took place. Nelson has been represented by celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred. The inscription reads, ""To a sweeter, more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas. Christmas 1977. Love, Roy Moore, D.A."" Below the signature reads 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House. Moore’s defenders have pointed out the date and place seem to have been written in different ink and handwriting than the note. In a Dec. 8 Good Morning America interview with Nelson about Moore’s response to the allegations (he denies them) and her experience since taking her story public, Nelson addressed the inconsistency. Nelson said she added the date and place of the inscription. ""He signed your yearbook?"" ABC News reporter Tom Llamas asked Nelson. ""He did sign it,"" Nelson said. ""And you made some notes underneath?"" Llamas asked. ""Yes,"" Nelson said. ""Nelson said she did make notes to the inscription, but the message was all Roy Moore,"" the video voiceover says. To summarize, Nelson says she added the time and location to the inscription. But she says the note and signature was from Moore. That’s not what the headlines of the Gateway Pundit, Breitbart or Silence is Consent. All three say Nelson said she either tampered with Moore’s signature or forged the inscription. There’s no evidence of that. Yet, the Gateway Pundit wrote that ""Nelson admitting that she added to Moore’s alleged signature is the final nail in the coffin,"" the story reads. ""Allred’s accuser is nothing but a fame-seeking fraud."" Fox News made a similar misstatement in their headline and story about the ABC report, which they later walked back. ""Roy Moore accuser admits she forged part of yearbook inscription attributed to Alabama Senate candidate,"" the original Fox News headline read. It was later edited to say she wrote, rather than forged, part of the inscription. The story did not include a clarification or correction when we last looked at it. The original Fox News story also said Nelson ""wrote part of the disputed note"" without specifying what she wrote, whereas the edited version clarified that ""she added the date and place in the inscription."" Our ruling The Gateway Pundit’s headline reads ""WE CALLED IT! Gloria Allred Accuser **ADMITS** She Tampered With Roy Moore’s Yearbook ‘Signature’ (VIDEO)."" But Nelson does not claim she tampered with Moore’s actual signature. She said she added a time and location below the signature. Nelson still attributes the note and signature to Moore.

"['Legal Issues', 'Women', 'Missouri', 'Roy Blunt']","
Blunt is partially accurate in Senate sexual harassment issues
","The U.S. Senate needs to clean up its own house when it comes to sexual harassment charges, regardless of whether Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore wins his Dec. 12 election, Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt has argued. Some Senate Republicans, including Blunt have not endorsed Moore, who is accused of sexual misconduct with a 14-year-old girl and several other teenagers, saying it’s up to Alabama voters whether to choose him or Democrat Doug Jones. Others, including President Donald Trump, are backing Moore. The election comes amid fallout of sexual misconduct claims against Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., who announced his resignation on Dec. 7, and Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., who stepped down on Dec. 5. Blunt said he and a few colleagues are trying to address sexual harassment procedures for charges against members of Congress because ""we need to be sure that we’ve got an environment where people want to come and be a part of that."" ""In the current law, if you report harassment, you’re the one that has to go into 20 hours of counseling before you can decide whether you were really harassed or not,"" Blunt said on Meet the Press on Nov. 19, 2017. ""That’s just totally inappropriate."" That seemed like an uncommon rule, so we wanted to dig into Blunt’s claim. Reporting harassment in Congress The standards for investigating employees and members of Congress is a lot different from ones laid out for the public in other states, and the process has come under scrutiny as allegations in Hollywood, politics and journalism have piled up. Congress’ rules for handling sexual harassment allegations are under the spotlight after reporting by The Washington Post and others found lawmakers essentially write their own rules for handling claims. Some lawmakers are working to fix their own workplace culture. The Post reported the story of a 19-year-old intern who said she was the victim of sexual misconduct but did not report it for fear of losing her job. The Post also shed light on another unique rule for reporting sexual harassment on Capitol Hill: The confidential payouts in settlements come from a special U.S. Treasury fund supported by tax dollars. Any member or employee of Congress who reports a violation of the Congressional Accountability Act (including sexual harassment) must go through mandatory steps to file a claim. This is known as the Dispute Resolution Process. Blunt’s statement addresses the first step: counseling. The person reporting sexual harassment must request counseling with the Office of Compliance within 180 days of the alleged harassment. According to the posted procedures, the counseling period normally lasts 30 days. But it may be reduced at the request of the employee. In Blunt’s statement, he said the counseling process takes 20 hours. We were unable to confirm the number of counseling hours each person receives during the 30-day period. When we asked Blunt’s office, spokesperson Katie Boyd pointed us to the Office of Compliance. Laura Cech, the outreach and publications coordinator for the Office of Compliance, did not specify whether Blunt was correct in saying 20 hours. She responded with a Q&A the office developed Nov. 13 outlining what they see as ""the most common misconceptions"" from the media about the process. The first question is about the required ""counseling"" — but it does not include how the 30-day process translates into hours. A counselor will ""discuss with an employee the information that gave rise to their concerns, and inform them of their rights under the law,"" the document says. It also notes the counseling can be completed over the phone or through a designated representative, such as an attorney. Remaining steps continue after counseling if the employee still believes he or she has been sexually harassed. The steps include a 30-day mediation where both parties are allowed the opportunity to resolve the dispute, administrative hearing or civil action, and the appeals process where the employee can request the final decision be reviewed by the OOC Board of Directors. Sandy Davidson, a professor at the University of Missouri who teaches law in the journalism school, said, ""The rules are bizarre and totally unfriendly to women."" Davidson also noted the confidentiality aspect of the laws. The rules say all statements, communications and documents during the mediation process are confidential. In Missouri, you can file a complaint with the Missouri Commission on Human Rights, which investigates complaints in public accommodations about race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, age and familial status. There is no requirement for counseling. Once the complaint is filed, the commission investigates by interviewing both sides. If the investigator finds discrimination, the commission attempts to settle the case. If the case is not settled, a hearing process gives a final decision and determines whether remedies such as back pay, reinstatement or promotion are ordered. Our ruling Blunt said, ""In the current law, if you report harassment, you’re the one that has to go into 20 hours of counseling before you can decide whether you were really harassed."" According to the Office of Compliance, any employee or member of Congress must go through counseling for a 30-day period before they can continue with further steps of reporting the harassment. However, we were unable to find evidence detailing how many hours the 30-day period includes. Blunt’s statement is on the right track but needs further clarification with the ""hours"" claim. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA16640>],/factchecks/2017/dec/08/roy-blunt/blunt-partially-accurate-senate-sexual-harassment-/

Paul Ryan's partially accurate claim that House tax bill saves typical Wisconsin household $2,000
","U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan is pushing back against criticism of a GOP tax plan that he hopes will become law before the end of the year. In a Dec. 1, 2017 National Public Radio interview, the Wisconsin Republican repeated his argument that the House version of tax reform is a middle-class tax cut. Then he made a claim about Wisconsin, saying:   This is designed to be a middle-class tax cut. I think the people who are concerned the most are some of the big businesses; that's where we hear most of the complaints about. But this is a middle-class tax cut, no two ways about it. I just ran the numbers of Wisconsin. The median family of four -- the median household of four -- gets about a $2,000 tax cut, on average. Ryan’s $2,000 claim is correct -- as far as it goes. But it leaves out some important information. The $2,000 To defend Ryan’s statement, his office referred us to the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee. A spokeswoman for the committee provided us these figures, which compare current law to the House bill, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The figures are for a Wisconsin household of four -- a couple with two minor children -- based on 2016 U.S. Census data for median income. The median income -- $91,532 -- means that half of four-person households in the state earned more than that in 2016 and half earned less. Current law House tax plan Adjusted gross income $91,532 $91,532 Standard deduction $13,000 $24,440 Personal exemptions $16,000 0 Taxable income $61,932 $67,132 10% bracket $1,905 --- 12% bracket --- $8,056 15% bracket $6,432 --- Preliminary liability $8,337 $8,056 Child tax credit $2,000 ($1,000 per child) $3,200 ($1,600 per child) Family credits --- $600 ($300 per parent) Tax liability $6,337 $4,256 Tax savings in 2018 --- $2,081 (The House bill would make several changes in the tax brackets, including replacing the 10 percent bracket with a 12 percent bracket.) The $2,081 savings figure is correct, according to experts at four think tanks we contacted: Amir El-Sibaie, an analyst at the Tax Foundation; Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; and Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center senior fellow Frank Sammartino; and Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy deputy director Meg Wiehe. But the experts agreed there are two important caveats: 1. Ryan’s example assumes the typical household he cites claims a standard deduction, rather than itemizing deductions. But many households at the income level Ryan cites itemize their deductions. That initial $2,081 in savings could be hundreds less if that household has claimed certain itemized deductions, such as for medical expenses, that would be eliminated by the House bill. (Other deductions eliminated or pared back in the House bill include the mortgage interest deduction, and the state and local tax deduction.) Marr told us IRS data shows that in 2015, 55 percent of Wisconsin tax filers with an income between $75,000 and $100,000 claimed itemized deductions instead of the standard deduction.   2. Even the household that stand to save $2,081 in 2018 would see that savings decrease each year going forward. According to these figures Marr provided, the annual savings drops to $767 by 2027: Year Tax savings for median income household of four in Wisconsin 2018 $2,081 2019 $1,956 2020 $1,889 2021 $1,819 2022 $1,749 2023 $1,076 2024 $1,018 2025 $903 2026 $827 2027 $767 The savings decline for several reasons, including: The family credit goes away after 2022; there generally aren’t inflation adjustments for the child tax credit; and the personal exemptions would be indexed to a different measure of inflation that increases more slowly. Our rating Ryan says that under the House Republican tax plan, in Wisconsin, ""the median household of four gets about a $2,000 tax cut, on average."" That’s true if the typical household Ryan describes claims a standard deduction on their taxes rather than itemizing deductions. The savings would be $2,081 -- in 2018. But many Wisconsin households at that income level would see a savings of several hundred dollars less because they would no longer be able to claim deductions such as one for medical expenses, which the House bill eliminates. Moreover, because of the way the House bill is written, even the household that saves $2,081 in 2018 would see that savings drop in each year, down to an estimated $767 in 2027.

"['National', 'Guns', 'Brendan Boyle']","
No, the GOP concealed carry bill does not block states from keeping guns out of schools
","The House passed a bill Dec. 6 that would make permits to carry a concealed weapon issued in one state valid in all other states, similarly to how driver’s licenses are recognized across state lines. Republicans attached the concealed carry measure to a bipartisan bill to strengthen the national background check system, causing House Democrats to sour on the legislative package. On the eve of the vote, one Democratic lawmaker warned the expansion of concealed-carry rights would prevent states from keeping guns away from schools. ""There are 12 states that don’t require permits for carrying guns. Under #HR38, someone from one of those states could travel to your community and walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say,"" Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., tweeted Dec. 5, referring to House Resolution 38. ""This bill is a nightmare. #StopCCR.""  There are 12 states that don’t require permits for carrying guns. Under #HR38, someone from one of those states could travel to your community and walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say. This bill is a nightmare. #StopCCR As the House-passed bill moves to the Senate, we decided to look at whether Boyle’s claim about the effects on state gun laws was correct. It turns out his read on the bill is misleading. Historically, each state has determined its own scheme for regulating concealed carry, which led to the current patchwork of varying laws and standards across the country. Thirty-eight states require gun owners to obtain a state-issued permit before than can lawfully carry a concealed weapon in public. A dozen states — as Boyle noted — require no permit. Traditionally, states have decided for themselves whether to honor out-of-state permits, a legal concept known as ""reciprocity."" Under the broad strokes of the House-passed Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, having a concealed-carry permit issued by one state makes it legal to carry in any state. And according to Boyle, the Republican measure would supersede state and local laws concerning the carry of concealed weapons in school zones. But a close reading of the interplay between the House-passed bill and state gun laws shows that’s not the case. Before discussing what Boyle gets wrong, it’s worth noting that his claim would have been more accurate if he’d taken aim at federal law, not state law. The federal Gun-Free School Zones Act generally prohibits concealed carry in a school zone, which is defined as a distance of 1,000 feet from the grounds of a public, parochial or private school. But the law makes an exception for people who hold a concealed carry permit from the state in which the school zone is located, according to David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. So under the Gun-Free School Zones Act, a permit issued by State A would allow you to legally carry in a school zone located in State A, but not a school zone in State B, Kopel said. But the bill the House voted on says that people with concealed-carry permits aren’t subject to the restrictions in the Gun-Free School Zones Act. In other words, Kopel said, if you had a permit from State A, and carried a gun into a school zone in State B, you would face no penalty under the Gun-Free School Zones Act. So Boyle would have been accurate to say the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act overrides federal law concerning the carry of concealed weapons in a school zone. But his claim was about state and local laws. Boyle specifically said the bill would allow residents of one of the dozen states that allow permitless concealed carry to ""walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say."" A large majority of states prohibit non-school employees from carrying in schools, even with a concealed carry permit. So if Boyle were correct, the House bill would stand to cancel out a great deal of gun regulation at the state level. But the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act clearly states that it does not supersede state law — the opposite of Boyle's claim. Under the bill, permit-holders would still be subject to any state or local laws that restrict the carry of a gun in a school or a designated zone around it. The bill reads: ""This section shall not be construed to supersede or limit the laws of any state that permit private persons or entities to prohibit or restrict the possession of concealed firearms on their property, or prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms on any state or local government property, installation, building, base, or park."" So if the bill becomes law, states would still be free to ban the carry of guns in school zones — and the federal law would also yield to any future laws passed by the minority of states that now generally allow concealed-carry permit holders to carry in schools. ""That’s precisely the opposite of Boyle’s point, which was local laws are irrelevant,"" said Adam Winkler, law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Joseph Blocher, a law professor at Duke University who specializes in federal and state constitutional law, agreed that Boyle’s statement is misleading. ""If the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act passes, someone from a permitless state could walk into a school zone without violating any federal law, since HR 38 basically rescinds the Gun Free School Zones Act,"" he said. ""But the part about ‘no matter what local laws say’ isn’t right."" Boyle said the concealed carry bill would allow residents of certain states to ""travel to your community and walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say."" While the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act would override a federal law concerning the carry of concealed weapons in a school zone, Boyle is wrong about how the bill would affect state and local gun laws. Concealed carry permit-holders — and residents of the dozen states that allow permitless concealed carry — would still be subject to any state or local laws that prohibit or restrict the carry of a gun in a school or a designated zone around it. We rate this False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7C17C0>],/factchecks/2017/dec/07/brendan-boyle/no-gop-concealed-carry-bill-does-not-block-states-/

Donald Trump says job market is getting non-workers working. Is it?
","President Donald Trump took a victory lap on the job market during one of his periodic Cabinet meetings. ""Unemployment is at a 17-year low,"" he said on Dec. 6, 2017. ""Very shortly it's going to be at a 19-year low. We think the numbers are going to continue to go down. And we're also getting into the pool of the 100 million people that are not working. That pool is now coming back. As you know, that's not considered in the low employment numbers, which means we have a lot of people that want to get to work, and that will be working."" The unemployment rate is indeed at its lowest point since December 2000. But we were curious about Trump’s other assertion -- that would-be workers from a pool of 100 million are coming back into the workforce. President Donald Trump at a cabinet meeting on Dec. 6, 2017. (Kevin Dietsch-Pool/Getty Images) First off, Trump is in the ballpark when he says that there are 100 million people not working. There are currently 95.4 million people above the age of 16 who are out of the labor force -- meaning neither working nor actively looking for work -- and another 6.5 million people who are unemployed. If you look at the raw number of Americans who are not in the labor force -- people who are not working or looking actively for work -- that figure has risen by 1.02 million since January 2017, an increase of about 1 percent. Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate -- or the percentage of people age 16 and up who are either working or actively looking for work -- has been bouncing around in a narrow band since Trump took office -- between 62.7 percent to 63.1 percent -- with no clear trend. While neither of these measures supports Trump’s assertion, each presents an imperfect view of the labor pool by including everyone 16 and up. Those totals are shaped by demographic changes. ""Demographic trends such as the aging of the baby boomer cohort have been the primary drivers for the decline in labor force participation,"" said Chris Lafakis, a director at Moody's Analytics. ""We simply have more retirees now because our population is older."" If you drill down using statistics that are more targeted to working-age Americans, Trump’s assertion looks more credible. Consider the employment-to-population ratio for Americans age 25 to 54. During Obama’s last 12 months, this measurement rose by half a percentage point. (Rising, for this statistic, is good -- it means a larger percentage of Americans are employed.) But in the first 10 months of Trump’s tenure, the statistic rose by six-tenths of a percentage point. That’s not a radical improvement, but it’s better than his predecessor managed in his final year. Here’s the full chart (with Obama months in blue and Trump months in red): If you look at the raw numbers, the number of non-workers in the 25 to 54 age range has declined by about 691,000 since January 2017. Another statistic also puts the improvement in 2017 in a favorable light. That would be the unemployment rate known as ""U-6."" This statistic uses a more generous definition of unemployment than the most commonly used measure. The U-6 rate includes not just workers who are officially unemployed but also those who are employed part-time when they would prefer a full-time job, and those who want to work but who haven’t looked for work in the preceding four weeks. In Obama’s final year, this measure dropped by half a percentage point. (A drop is a good sign.) But under Trump, it has dropped by 1.5 percentage points -- three times faster in a shorter period of time. Here’s the full chart: This statistic is an important one for judging Trump’s assertion, because the people who would be driving the declines would specifically be those who find jobs after being unemployed by conventional definitions, plus those who had been forced to work only part time and those who had not looked for work for several months. ""President Trump is correct that the ‘pool of non-workers’ continues to shrink,"" said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless, though he added that it has done so ""fairly steadily"" since the last quarter of 2011. Jed Kolko, the chief economist for the job site Indeed.com, puts significant stock in the two statistics that support Trump’s statement. ""Our view is that the labor market is entering 2018 with strength and momentum, with some room to grow,"" Kolko said. Finally, it’s worth noting that no president can take full credit for the economy’s achievements (or take full fault for its shortcomings). Many other factors, including the health of the rest of the world economy and changes in demographics and technology, play a role as well. Our ruling Trump said that ""we’re … getting into the pool of the 100 million people that are not working. That pool is now coming back."" The statistics that shine the most direct light on working-age Americans support Trump’s point. Both the working-age employment-to-population ratio and the U-6 expanded unemployment rate have improved on Trump’s watch. It’s worth noting that they also improved during Obama’s final year, so Trump was fortunate to take office at a time when the economy was already going in the right direction. But the scale of the increase has been bigger under Trump. We rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBBAC00>],/factchecks/2017/dec/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-job-market-getting-non-workers-w/

Doug Jones launches misleading attack ad about Roy Moore's court record on sex crime cases
","In the Alabama Senate race, Democrat Doug Jones launched an ad to suggest Republican Roy Moore goes easy on sex offenders. Moore called on stations airing the ad to pull it, saying it ""blatantly misrepresents the facts and my judicial record."" The ad speaks of three cases from Moore’s days on the Alabama State Supreme Court. Here’s the full text from the ad, although this fact-check focuses only on the first case from 2014. ""Alabama, there's a pattern. In a 2014 case involving a man convicted of abusing two underage girls, Judge Roy Moore disagreed and wrote the dissenting opinion. In a 2015 case involving a man who pleaded guilty to raping an underage girl, Roy Moore dissented again. And Roy Moore was the only Supreme Court justice who sided with a felon convicted of sexual abuse of a child at a daycare center. Court documents, real facts. Roy Moore's disturbing conduct."" On television, the visuals are important. Here’s what viewers saw.  In one of the most reliably Republican states, Moore has been fighting headwinds after multiple reports that he made sexual advances on young women under 18 when he was in his 30s. The Jones attack ad plays to that issue. In the 2014 case, Jones misappropriated technical elements of the legal saga to leave voters with the wrong idea. In 2010, Sherman Fitzgerald Tate, then in his mid 30s, worked as a mentor with the Youth Advocate Program at Pointe Academy in Mobile, Ala. The court-funded program aimed to help troubled teens. A security camera recorded Tate bringing two 15-year-old girls into a conference room. He was not their assigned mentor. There was no tape of what took place inside the room. The two girls accused him of coercing them to touch him and each other sexually. Tate was convicted on two counts of second-degree sodomy. His lawyer wanted to bring in testimony that the two girls had a romantic relationship with each other and that Tate had told one of the girls’ mother about it. That information would, the lawyer said, give the girls a reason to invent a charge against Tate. But under Alabama law, victims of sexual assault are shielded from any exploration of their past sexual activity, because it could bias a jury against them. This is a fundamental principle that holds in many states. The trial judge blocked the testimony and an appeals court agreed. Tate’s lawyer brought the issue to the state supreme court. The majority of the justices, five, declined to hear the case. Moore and two other justices disagreed. In his dissent, Moore basically argued that courts in Massachusetts, Mississippi, Colorado and elsewhere had allowed similar evidence in certain cases and there was a reasonable argument that the facts in Tate’s case ""would make the proposed cross-examination relevant to show that the victims had possibly fabricated the charges against Tate."" The key line in Moore’s dissent, however, is the last one: ""I believe that we should resolve this material question of first impression."" In other words, Moore's dissent was about resolving the legal question for future cases. We reached several experts in appellate law and all of them agreed that Moore was only arguing that the court should hear the case. ""He was saying there’s a decent legal issue in the case that the court ought to resolve,"" David Moran at the University of Michigan Law School. ""It read like a perfectly reasonable dissent, and it would be grossly unfair to attribute anything to him based on a dissent from a denial of review."" Peter Smith at George Washington University Law School agreed, saying that at that point in the process, Moore was not challenging the case itself against Tate, but the legal issue of what testimony was admissible. ""In theory, if the court had heard the case, he could have ruled against the guy,"" Smith said. Smith said Moore was telegraphing some sympathy for Tate’s position, but again, this dissent alone did not amount to disagreeing with Tate’s conviction. The ad raises two other cases to show Moore’s ""disturbing conduct."" The 2015 case involved second-degree rape and like the charges against Tate, the issue was whether the sexual activity of the victim should have been presented at the trial. Moore and two other justices joined in saying the court should decide the matter. In the ad’s final example, Moore was the lone dissenter. The case involved a 17-year-old boy who performed a sexual act on a 4-year-old boy at a daycare center. The teen was convicted on two counts -- first-degree sodomy of a child under 12 and first-degree sodomy by forcible compulsion. Moore took issue with the second count, arguing that there was no evidence of an implied threat of serious physical injury or death in the case. The matter was made more complicated because the offender was under 18, which put him in a gray zone under state law. Moore argued that the court was going beyond what lawmakers had written. An ad from the Jones campaign said that Moore disagreed and dissented in a case involving the abuse of two underage girls. There is no question that Moore dissented, but the ad provides no context for what Moore disagreed with. The glaring lack of detail leaves reasonable viewers with the impression that Moore disagreed with the conviction. That’s not what he said. He disagreed with the court’s decision not to consider a legal question of admissible evidence. Several independent law professors told us that Moore raised a valid point that was legally separate from the underlying conviction in the case. The ad leaves out critical context that gives a highly misleading impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB0A140>],/factchecks/2017/dec/06/doug-jones/jones-ad-wrongly-attacks-moore-sex-crime-case/

Is Donald Trump correct about the history of the Jerusalem Embassy Act?
","President Donald Trump on Dec. 6 unveiled a new policy regarding Israel’s capital city, stating that ""it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel."" In his remarks, Trump said he would be designating Jerusalem as the officially recognized capital of Israel and ""directing the State Department to begin preparation to move the American embassy"" from its current location in Tel Aviv. In his remarks, Trump noted that the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 had ""passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago."" The 1995 law Trump cited mandated that the embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by 1999. However, Palestinians also consider Jerusalem to be their capital, and the city has long been considered one of the stickiest points of contention for final-status negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. Most other nations that have diplomatic relations with Israel have continued to locate their embassies in Tel Aviv. For these reasons, past U.S. presidents from both parties have regularly signed waivers to suspend the move, amid fears it would destabilize peace talks. So is Trump correct in describing the legislative history of the law? We took a closer look. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Dec. 6, 2017. (Olivier Douliery/Abaca Press/TNS) The Jerusalem Embassy Act ""passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority"" For this portion of his statement, Trump is on solid ground. In the Senate, the bill passed on Oct. 24, 1995, by a 93-5 margin. Later that day, the House followed suit, passing it by a 374-37 margin. The law was ""reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago."" This part requires more explanation. The non-binding resolution from earlier this year involved ""commemorating the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem"" during the Six Day War in 1967. One of its provisions specifically referenced the 1995 law. A portion of the 2017 resolution ""reaffirms the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 (Public Law 104–45) as United States law, and calls upon the President and all United States officials to abide by its provisions."" On June 5, 2017, the measure passed the Senate by a 90-0 margin. Here’s the caveat: The same resolution that passed the Senate 90-0 also included this provision: The Senate ""reaffirms that it is the longstanding, bipartisan policy of the United States government that the permanent status of Jerusalem remains a matter to be decided between the parties through final status negotiations towards a two-state solution."" Did Trump do or say anything contrary to that provision? There’s some disagreement on that. Trump in his remarks offered some language reaffirming the substance of this provision. Specifically, he said, ""In making these announcements, I also want to make one point very clear: This decision is not intended, in any way, to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement. We want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians. We are not taking a position of any final status issues, including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, or the resolution of contested borders. Those questions are up to the parties involved."" To Michael Koplow, policy director of the Israel Policy Forum, this ""made clear that his decision doesn’t prejudice final status issues, so it seems to still be consistent with the Senate resolution."" Others, however, contend that an embassy move may imperil future Israeli-Palestinian negotiations over Jerusalem. ""Not only is this a reasonable caveat, it is a critical one,"" said Samer S. Shehata, a professor and acting director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Oklahoma. ""If you've been following the British, French and many of the other reactions to President Trump's move, almost all note this critical point."" In their public remarks, both French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May made a point of reaffirming the need for future final-status negotiations about Jerusalem, which suggests that they are worried about the impact of Trump’s move in that context. Macron, in a phone call to Trump before the announcement, ""expressed his concern with the possibility that the United States might unilaterally recognize Jerusalem as capital of the state of Israel,"" the French government said. ""Mr. Macron reaffirmed that the status of Jerusalem must be resolved through peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, and particularly those relating to the establishment of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security with Jerusalem as their capital."" May said that she’s ""intending to speak to President Trump about this matter. The status of Jerusalem should be determined in a negotiated settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Jerusalem should ultimately form a shared capital between the Israeli and Palestinian states."" Our ruling Trump said that the Jerusalem Embassy Act ""passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago."" He’s right about both pieces of legislation and the margins by which they passed. However, it’s worth noting that the 2017 Senate resolution also reaffirmed that ""the permanent status of Jerusalem remains a matter to be decided between the parties through final status negotiations towards a two-state solution"" -- a position that Trump rhetorically backed in his speech, but that some believe could be endangered by his decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the embassy.

"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Adam Putnam']","
Does Andrew Gillum want to make Florida a sanctuary state?
","Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam is using the controversial topic of sanctuary cities to drum up Republican support in his bid for governor. At a campaign stop in Jacksonville, Putnam warned voters that one of his Democratic opponents wants a statewide expansion of policies that prevent the deportation of immigrants in the country illegally. ""There’s a candidate running for governor who wants to make Florida not a sanctuary city, but a sanctuary state,"" Putnam said Nov. 30. ""That’s crazy talk."" There is no specific legal definition of sanctuary cities, but the term generally describes jurisdictions that to some extent limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials or don't honor their detainer requests. With that in mind, we wondered: Does a Democratic gubernatorial candidate really want to make Florida a sanctuary state? Putnam’s team singled out Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum as having this plan. But nothing on Gillum’s website calls for a move on this scale, and Gillum’s team says ""sanctuary state"" is not an accurate description of what Gillum envisions for Florida. So what’s the deal? Putnam’s team pointed to a tweet and multiple news articles where Gillum criticized President Donald Trump’s January 2017 executive order to penalize cities that don't comply with federal immigration agents by withholding federal funds. The next day, Gillum took to Twitter and posted a lengthy statement to attack Trump’s decision as ""inconsistent with our highest values,"" adding the United States can ""protect national security interests and have a secure border without criminalizing people who are here undocumented."" Those examples didn’t show Gillum calling for a statewide sanctuary law or policy similar, so we asked the Gillum campaign for more insight on what he wants to do. ""The commissioner accused Andrew of something that he never said,"" spokesman Geoff Burgan told PolitiFact Florida.  As Tallahassee mayor, Burgan said that Gillum was clear that local law enforcement agencies are not Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. In other words, Gillum believes local law enforcement should be focused on enforcing the laws of their city, not deporting undocumented immigrants. Gillum’s campaign website says that he will ""continue to fight mass deportation policies"" and calls for an end to Trump’s attack on ""cities friendly to immigrants.""  ""Andrew believes that a decision between security or compassionate immigration policy are false choices; we can have them both,"" it reads. ""As Governor, Andrew will use every effort to protect Florida from President Trump’s attacks on immigrants."" As of November 2017, Tallahassee is not considered a sanctuary city by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter immigration laws and regularly updates a map on its website detailing what it considers sanctuary cities, counties and states. Jessica Vaughan, the center’s director of policy studies, said Gillum’s statements to the Tallahassee Democrat indicate that he is a ""sanctuary-sympathizer"" who has adopted the language of people who support sanctuary policies. But while his rhetoric may raise concerns to her group, Gillum has not gone as far as articulating a policy mimicking other states that do have the unofficial classification as a ""sanctuary state."" The group considers six states, including California and Illinois, as having statewide sanctuary policies. In 2014, California adopted the Trust Act, which prohibited local law enforcement agencies from holding individuals solely based on their immigration status, unless certain criteria are met. That criteria includes factors like whether the immigrant has a serious or violent felony conviction or a specific sexual crimes conviction. For what it’s worth, none of the other Democratic candidates for governor — former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, Chris King from Orlando and Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine — have specifically said they want to make Florida a sanctuary state, either. We couldn’t find any instances of those candidates speaking out against Trump’s 2017 executive order, but in June, Graham tweeted about a House bill known as ""No Sanctuary for Criminals Act."" This piece of legislation cut funds for cities that protect immigrants. ""While Trump is attacking the press, the House is attacking immigrants & voting to defund law enforcement agencies – potentially many in FL,"" Graham tweeted, adding that she voted against similar legislation in 2015. Putnam said Gillum wants to make Florida a ""sanctuary state."" Putnam's comment is extrapolated from Gillum's vows to fight back against Trump's attack on sanctuary cities. As mayor of Tallahassee, Gillum criticized Trump’s executive order threatening to suspend funding to sanctuary cities, and Gillum’s campaign said as governor he would support an approach like in Tallahassee that emphasizes immigration enforcement as a federal responsibility, not a local one. But Gillum has not offered a specific statewide policy for not cooperating with detainer requests from immigration enforcement officials. His position is murkier than Putnam describes.

Story misleads tying Obama Russian spy swap to Hillary Clinton's Uranium One ties
","A headline points the finger at former President Barack Obama for releasing Russian agents. ""Obama released 10 Russian agents from U.S. custody in 2010 during Hillary’s uranium deal,"" stated the Nov. 26 headline in Puppet String News. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. While Puppet String News is a fake news website, in this case the headline stems from real news. The Puppet String story linked to an October 2010 New York Times story which stated that Russian sleeper agents, arrested in the United States in the summer of 2010 and deported to Russia as part of a prisoner exchange, later received top government honors from President Dmitri Medvedev. In exchange for the Russian prisoners, Medvedev signed pardons for four men Russia considered spies who had been held for many years. ""The agreement we reached today provides a successful resolution for the United States and its interests,"" Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said at the time. The Puppet String News story included information from the New York Times story recapping the prisoner swap, which involved the arrest of the agents in the suburbs of New York, Boston and Northern Virginia in the summer of 2010. The agents had been directed to gather information in the U.S. on nuclear weapons, American policy toward Iran and other topics. The agents were ""widely lampooned in the West as bumbling caricatures of a bygone era"" for using outdated methods, but in Russia they were praised by top leaders, the New York Times wrote. There was nothing in the New York Times story that mentioned Hillary Clinton or uranium. The Puppet String News article then added it’s own speculation -- without any evidence -- that the swap involved Russia providing millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for Obama releasing the Russian agents. ""As this sounds like the case with these 10 Russian agents being deported back to Russia in 2010 at the same time of the Uranium One deal,"" Puppet String News wrote. PolitiFact has previously explained the complex tale which pertains to a company with significant U.S. uranium assets, the Clinton Foundation, and a decision by several federal agencies to allow greater Russian influence in the United States’ uranium market. Some have alleged that, as secretary of state, Clinton approved the sale of U.S. uranium assets to Russia’s nuclear energy agency in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation. While the connections between the Clinton Foundation and the Uranium One deal may appear fishy to some, there has been no proof of quid pro quo. And it’s not accurate to say that Clinton approved the sale herself. Most of the Clinton Foundation donations in question occurred before and during Clinton’s 2008 presidential run, before she could have known she would become secretary of state. The decision in 2010 to greenlight the Uranium One deal was approved by a panel comprising multiple governmental agencies, so it’s misleading to conclude the State Department, then headed by Clinton, acted unilaterally. We sent a message to Puppet String News via Facebook and did not get a reply. By all indications, the prisoner release is no more connected to the Uranium One deal than any number of other events that occurred in 2010.

PA Rep. Lou Barletta overstates benefits of the House tax bill
","After a failed attempt at health care reform, Republican leaders in Congress are working on reforming tax policy. The U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on Nov. 16. Rep. Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania’s 11th District tweeted a slew of claims about tax reform a few days before the Senate passed their own tax bill early Saturday morning. The following was tweeted on Nov. 29 from Barletta’s account: ""GDP is booming. Let’s spread the prosperity to the middle class with big #TaxCuts. Our #TaxReform package doubles standard deduction, brings $$$ back home, and reduces rates for ALL taxpayers. We will #MAGA."" Barletta, who voted in favor of the House bill, has a list of reasons the legislation could benefit taxpayers. However, we wanted to see if ""ALL taxpayers"" will have reduced tax rates. In support of the House bill First, we confirmed that Barletta was referring to the House version of the bill in his tweet. One of the major differences between the two bills is the number of income tax brackets and corresponding tax rates. The House bill changes the current number of seven tax brackets to four, which would be 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. On average, each income group will receive a tax cut David Jackson, a spokesman for Barletta, sent a report on the House bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee in Congress, as the source for Barletta’s tweet. ""According to the Joint Committee, in 2019, Americans in every income category will see a tax cut,"" Jackson told PolitiFact Pennsylvania. The table in the report shows that, on average, each income group will have a reduced effective tax rate in 2019 compared to the current law. But that isn’t what Barletta tweeted. Barletta’s tweet made it seem as if every single taxpayer will see a rate reduction, which contradicts a report released by the Tax Policy Center. In 2018, if broken down into quintiles, a little more than 7 percent of individuals will be subjected to an increased tax rate. About 75 percent of individuals will receive a tax cut. ""There are specific individuals in each income group that would actually pay higher taxes,"" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told PolitiFact Pennsylvania. In 2018, the percentage of individuals with a tax increase in the lowest income distribution would be 1.7 percent, 6 percent in the second, 9.2 percent in the middle, 11.5 percent in the fourth and 12.9 percent in the top. The ‘chained Consumer Price Index’ and ‘bubble rate’ create some tax rate increases The House and Senate bill both propose using chained CPI to index standard deductions according to inflation. Standard deductions include $12,000 for single filers, $18,300 for households and $24,400 for joint filers in the House bill. Starting in 2018, the chained CPI would also move some individuals into higher tax brackets at a faster pace since bracket cutoffs would be moved in relation to a lower inflation measure. Gleckman said that process will contribute to average tax rates going up by 2027. This will likely increase the percentage of individuals with tax rate increases in 2027 to more than 25 percent compared to the 7 percent in 2018. ""What will happen is middle-income people and lower-income people will end up paying slightly higher taxes than they do under current law,"" Gleckman said. At first, the bill will increase the effective tax rates of some individuals in the top 1 percent. The ""bubble rate"" put in the bill for individual income rates and brackets would make the top effective tax rates rise to 49.4 percent for some high-income taxpayers, and then fall by 2027.

"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Small Business', 'Wisconsin', 'Mary Burke']","
Wisconsin under Scott Walker is near bottom in new businesses, Mary Burke says
","In a Milwaukee Public Radio interview on Sept. 22, 2014, Democrat Mary Burke critiqued Gov. Scott Walker’s jobs strategy, saying the Republican governor ""generally believes that you give tax breaks to those at the top and the special interests and somehow it trickles down and creates jobs."" ""Well, I’m a business person. That’s not how jobs get created,"" countered Burke, who formerly served as a Trek Bicycle Corp. executive and state Commerce secretary. ""So, it’s a flawed model and I have a very different model and I lay out in my jobs plan the five core strategies on how we’re going to do this,"" Burke continued, before making a claim we want to check. ""It means we need to have a more entrepreneurial climate in Wisconsin. That’s one of them (her five strategies). Right now, we’re 46th in the country in terms of new businesses started."" Just the other day, we rated True a Walker claim that Wisconsin ranks 11th ""in total business establishment growth,"" compared with 47th in the years that Burke was Commerce secretary. So we wondered whether Burke’s claim contradicts that. As we’ll see, terminology is key. Different measures Walker referred to ""business establishments,"" a term that means a business location, such as a new store or factory or farm. A single company can have multiple ""establishments,"" and new ""establishments"" can be opened by existing or new firms. So it’s a particular measure. Burke’s terminology is different than Walker’s, and refers to a different measuring stick. In October 2013, days after announcing her candidacy for governor, Burke said Wisconsin was 49th in the United States in ""new businesses created."" We rated her statement Mostly True. Burke cited the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, an annual study produced by the nonpartisan Kauffman Foundation, a Kansas City-based group that works to foster entrepreneurial activity. Business administration professor Stewart Thornhill, executive director of the Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies at the University of Michigan, told us it is a widely cited measure. The index uses U.S. Census data to capture the number of new business owners in their first month of significant business activity. In Kauffman’s 2013 index, Wisconsin tied with Michigan for 48th among the states in the number of entrepreneurs per 100,000 people, ahead of only Nebraska and Minnesota. So, what’s the landscape now? Burke’s evidence To back Burke’s new claim, her campaign cited the 2014 Kauffman index. Here are the states rated lowest in terms of new business owners in their first month of significant business activity:   Rank/State Entrepreneurs per 100,000 people U.S. average 280 (tie) Wisconsin and Washington                170 (tie) Minnesota and Indiana 160 Rhode Island 140 Iowa 110   So, Wisconsin is actually one notch higher than Burke indicated. On one hand, tying for 45th is an improvement from 48th in the 2013 index. On the other hand, Wisconsin’s 2014 rate of 170 entrepreneurs per 100,000 people is actually lower than its 2013 rate of 180. (Montana ranked first in both 2013 and 2014. Its 2014 rate was 610 entrepreneurs per 100,000 people.) Walker’s response Walker campaign spokeswoman Alleigh Marré pointed out that in our earlier Burke factcheck, the Kauffman Foundation warned that its index isn’t meant to provide a precise ranking of states. But its report in effect does that by reporting precise ratings and singling out states in the top five highest and lowest groups. Marré also cited other business-creation statistics, including the Walker claim about total business establishment growth. But, again, that is a different measure than the one Burke cites. Our rating Burke said Wisconsin is ""46th in the country in terms of new businesses started."" Wisconsin actually ties for 45th in the well-known Kauffman index, in terms of new business owners in their first month of significant business activity. We rate the statement Mostly True.

Carter claim about median household income on target
","Georgia’s economy has been hotly debated in this year’s governor’s race. And in a new television ad, Democratic nominee Jason Carter says power brokers at the state Capitol need to do more for the middle class. ""In the last 10 years, Georgia’s middle-class income has dropped $6,500,"" he says. ""We have to change that."" The two-term state senator from Atlanta who is hoping to unseat Republican incumbent Gov. Nathan Deal in the Nov. 4 general election has previously voiced concern about the shrinking income of the middle class. At a press conference in January, when 2012 figures were the most recent available, Carter said the income of an average Georgia family, adjusted for inflation, is about $6,000 less than it was 10 years ago. PolitiFact Georgia rated that statement True, albeit on the conservative side. Carter was relying on historical data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The data showed that the median household income in Georgia fell by an estimated $6,682, from $54,803 in 2002 to $48,121 in 2012, when adjusted for inflation. Nationally, in that same period, the median household income dropped from $54,127 to $51,017, or $3,110, according to the Census Bureau’s data. Carter’s new ad cites a $6,500, 10-year drop in household income. That’s even more on target with the Census Bureau data. Still, we decided to go a little further since, after Carter’s ad aired, the Census Bureau came out with new data for 2013. The middle-class income number also provides one more measure for trying to assess what’s going on with Georgia’s economy. It can be a cloudy picture. Deal says nearly 300,000 jobs have been created in his tenure. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says Georgia’s unemployment rate jumped from 6.9 percent in April to 8.1 percent in August. So what’s the latest info on median household income? In the U.S. Census Bureau’s just-released 2013 American Community Survey, Georgia had a median household income of $47,829 in 2013, inflation-adjusted dollars. The state ranked 34th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia, with Maryland the highest at $72,483, Mississippi the lowest at $37,963. The survey said the median household income for the nation was $52,250 — $4,421 higher than Georgia’s. The numbers, however, showed metro Atlanta’s median household income at $55,733. That is above the national average. And more than half of all Georgians live in or near metro Atlanta. Median household income is down for metro Atlanta and Georgia since 2010, the first year after the government says the recession ended and the year Deal was elected governor. Metro Atlanta’s median household income was $56,850 for 2010, and in inflation-adjusted dollars, Georgia’s was $49,412, according to the survey. (Note: Some estimates in the American Community Survey differ from prior estimates.) In inflation-adjusted dollars, Georgia’s median household income was $47,536 in 2011 and $47,811 in 2012. Wesley Tharpe, a policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, said income and wages have been basically stagnant in the state for the past two to three years. ""What we saw with the Great Recession, starting around 2007, was employment and income just really fell through the floor due to the collapse of the housing market, the collapse of the stock market,"" Tharpe said. ""Those really hurt Georgia because of our reliance on the housing industry and construction jobs."" Since that crash, the economy has been gradually moving in the right direction, he said. ""But incomes and the ability for families to make a living and make ends meet is really lagging behind,"" Tharpe said. ""We haven’t really seen that much growth since we hit that floor."" In summary, Carter’s ad says middle-class income has dropped $6,500 in 10 years. He bases this on historical data from the U.S. Census Bureau. That shows Georgia’s median household income, in inflation-adjusted dollars, fell by $6,682, from $54,803 in 2002 to $48,121 to 2012. We rate Carter’s ad claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF0F2C0>],/factchecks/2014/sep/29/jason-carter/carter-claim-about-median-household-income-target/
"['Congress', 'Elections', 'History', 'PunditFact', 'Laura Ingraham']","
Current Congress adjourned earlier in election year than any previous Congress, Ingraham claims
","A couple of hefty issues await congressional action. There’s the matter of replacing departing Attorney General Eric Holder, and even more pressing, authorizing or rejecting America’s attacks on the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq where airstrikes are ongoing. But both items are for the moment on hold until lawmakers get back Nov. 12. Their last official day of business was Sept. 19. Conservative radio show host Laura Ingraham was particularly peeved by Congress’ absence as the American military returns to war in the Middle East. Ingraham focused on the constitutional role Congress has in declaring war. ""We should have civilian authorization, civilian leadership authorization for this war, otherwise we're going to be in for real trouble down the road,"" Ingraham said. Moments earlier, she said: ""The Congress adjourned earliest of any time in Congressional history before an election."" We thought we’d check whether taking a long break in September and October is as record-setting as Ingraham asserted. She’s incorrect, but before we get to the details, we need to clarify a couple of terms. When we talk about a session of Congress, we mean the stretch that starts in January and generally ends in December. According the Congressional Research Service, ""A session begins when the chamber convenes and ends when it adjourns. A recess, by contrast, does not terminate a session, but only suspends it temporarily."" Lawmakers and pundits often refer to a recess as an adjournment. Right now, technically Congress is in recess. The Congressional Research Service acknowledged that the informal use of the words doesn’t always align with their formal meaning. The House of Representatives has a table with the schedule of every session of Congress going back to 1789. To check Ingraham’s claim, we need only go back as far as 1960. That year, Congress ended its session for the year and adjourned on Sept. 1. That was a full adjournment (not just a recess) and it came 18 days sooner than this year’s extended recess. For the record, 1960 was the year that Republican Richard Nixon faced Democrat John F. Kennedy. Interestingly, Sept. 1 was not particularly early for the times. In 1959, Congress adjourned for the year Sept. 15. In 1958, Congress adjourned Aug. 24. In 1956, it was July 27. We note that the last two in that list were election years. So Ingraham is wrong, but we should note similar-sounding claims Sunday that are accurate. On Fox News Sunday, Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barasso said, ""This is the earliest Congress has adjourned in over 50 years."" On CBS’ Face the Nation, Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine called it ""the second-earliest recess before a midterm since 1960."" Both senators are correct (if you excuse Barrasso’s use of adjourn instead of recess). For Barrasso, ""over 50 years,"" takes us back to any year up to 1963, or 51 years ago. The record shows that since 1963, Congress often has taken short breaks in September, given lawmakers several weeks in October to campaign in election years, and even closed the books for the year in October. But an extended break from mid September to mid November has not occurred. Kaine’s claim is spot on. Our ruling Ingraham said Congress had adjourned earlier this year than in any time in ""Congressional history before an election."" Technically, Congress is in recess and hasn’t adjourned. But setting that aside, the record shows that in 1960, Congress adjourned and ended its session Sept. 1 -- more than two weeks before the current Congress took its recess. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC78BE40>],/factchecks/2014/sep/28/laura-ingraham/current-congress-adjourned-earlier-election-year-a/

LZ Granderson: Obama has bombed twice as many Muslim countries as Bush
","In light of recent U.S. military involvement in the Middle East, some say the voters who put President Barack Obama into office in 2008 didn’t sign up for this. On CNN’s State of the Union Sept. 28, political commentator LZ Granderson said Obama is losing favor among his base supporters because of his recent foreign policy decisions. In 2008, they were tired of the wars started under former President George W. Bush and were hoping that a new president would bring them to a close. ""They voted for him because he was supposed to end these wars and stop bombing people,"" Granderson said. ""And when you look at the raw numbers, three times as much Special Forces were used than ‘W.’, twice as many strikes (on) countries that are predominantly Muslim. Those were not the numbers that his staunch progressive base voted for."" Last week, we fact-checked the New Yorker’s Washington correspondent Ryan Lizza, who tweeted, ""Countries bombed: Obama 7, Bush 4."" We rated that claim True. Granderson’s claim that there have been ""twice as many strikes (on) countries that are predominantly Muslim"" is similar to Lizza’s -- but with the added caveat that these are Muslim countries, so we decided to check it out again. The tally When we compared Bush and Obama last week, Lizza sent us this list of countries that had been bombed by each president: Bush: Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Somalia. Obama: Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria. We asked Granderson for additional evidence. He cited the same numbers as Lizza, and pointed to a supporting CNN article. We found little reason to challenge the nations Lizza and Granderson named. If anything, they shortchanged both presidents. There’s no question about airstrikes in Afghanistan and Iraq -- Bush launched wars in both countries, and airstrikes have continued there under Obama. Drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia have been in the news for a long time, with or without official acknowledgment. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit news service based at City University London, maintains a running list of U.S. military actions in a number of countries, including Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen, based on press and official reports. By its tally, American drone strikes against suspected terrorists in Somalia occurred under both Bush and Obama. In the case of Yemen, we found evidence of just one airstrike there under Bush -- back in 2002, reported by BBC News and Time magazine. This would increase Bush’s total to five countries, but the strikes have been much more frequent under Obama. The air attacks on Libya that helped topple Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 under Obama are well documented. In March 2011, the United States and British warships fired more than 100 cruise missiles to destroy Libyan air defenses. And, of course, there’s now Syria. We also found some unconfirmed reports of drone attacks on suspected militant camps in the Philippines in 2006 and 2012, reported by the New York Times and an expert at the Brookings Institute. If these reports are accurate, the totals for Bush and Obama would rise by one. The final, maximum number would be Bush 6: Obama 8. Predominantly Muslim Granderson is correct to say these countries are all predominantly Muslim (with the exception of the Philippines, which is not included in his tally). We found at a Pew report that said each of the seven countries with confirmed airstrikes under Obama are more than 90 percent Muslim, as of 2010. Afghanistan: 99.8 percent Iraq: 98.9 percent Pakistan: 96.4 percent Somalia: 98.6 percent Yemen: 99.0 percent Libya: 96.6 percent Syria: 92.8 percent The Philippines, on the other hand, is just 5.1 percent Muslim. For comparison, the United States is 0.8 percent Muslim, according to the Pew report. Our ruling Granderson said Obama has conducted ""twice as many strikes (on) countries that are predominantly Muslim"" as Bush. By Granderson’s count -- Bush four countries, Obama seven countries -- it’s a little less than twice (1.75 times to be exact). While you can make arguments that both Bush and Obama have bombed additional countries, we think Granderson -- and Lizza before him -- are using reasonable figures based on what’s publicly known. Granderson’s claim is accurate but could use the caveat nearly twice. As such, we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD0C280>],/factchecks/2014/sep/28/lz-granderson/lz-granderson-obama-has-bombed-twice-many-muslim-c/

Buddy Cianci says in 2001 and '02, when he was Providence mayor, the pension system was fully funded
","Former Providence Mayor Vincent ""Buddy"" Cianci Jr. says he's running to regain his old job because he believes the city has gone downhill since he was forced to leave office in September 2002. One of the biggest problems facing the city is the lack of money and part of the problem is a severely-underfunded pension system. According to the most recent data, from July 31, 2013, the city has only 31.4 percent of the money it needs to pay for its pension obligations. During the Sept. 21 edition of WPRI-TV's ""Newsmakers"" program, which featured Cianci rattling off a blizzard of financial numbers about the city, host Tim White asked Cianci about his role in the pension shortfall. After playing an old video in which Cianci stressed the importance of fully paying the city's pension costs, White noted that from 1998 to 2002, the city was putting in only 60 percent or less of what it was supposed to be paying. Cianci said that he did pay in full, and he had a document to prove it. ""In 2001 and '02, a letter that I have from the finance director says that we had the pension system funded at [the] 100 percent level in that year, and we did for two years at that point,"" he said. Cianci made it clear later in the interview that he was referring to the two years prior to his leaving office. So was the Cianci administration putting all of the money it was supposed to into the pension fund in those two years? The short answer is no. City pension records show that in the 2001 fiscal year, the city paid only 60.6 percent of the amount it needed to properly fund its pension program. That amount is an estimate known as the annual required contribution, or ARC. And in 2002, another year when Cianci said the pension was being funded at 100 percent, the funding level was actually 64.2 percent. Only in the 2003 fiscal year, when Cianci was mayor for just over two months (to be succeeded by John Lombardi and, later, David Cicilline, now a U.S. representative) did the ratio rise significantly, to 80.3 percent. By then, the pension fund was hobbled with a massive debt, with only $335 million of the $899 million it needed. And what about the letter Cianci was talking about? First, a little background. From 1991 through the 1994 fiscal year, and again in the 1996 fiscal year, Providence was paying 100 percent of the ARC. (Cianci, who had been mayor from 1975 until 1984 when he was removed from office after being convicted of felony assault, began his second stint as mayor in 1991.) But after the first few years of Cianci's second administration, the funding for Providence's pension program began a precipitous decline. The city paid 54 percent in 1995, then 93.6 percent in 1997, 57.5 percent in 1998, 56.2 in 1999, 60.0 percent in 2000. Cianci and Alex Prignano, who was Cianci's finance director at the time and is now business manager in the Cumberland school department, told PolitiFact Rhode Island in a joint interview that pension benefits were the subject of lawsuits. To make a long story short, Cianci had agreed in 1991 to annual 5-percent cost-of-living increases; in 1994, amid concerns over the mounting expense of funding them, the city filed suit seeking relief from the increases. As the suit progressed, the city based its pension fund payments on the assumption that it would win the suit. It was also working under the belief that if it fully funded the pension system, it would be harder to argue in court that the cost of living payments were unsustainable, Prignano and Cianci said. (The Providence Journal's Tom Mooney outlined the saga in a June 7, 2011 story.) When the state Supreme Court ruled on the case in 2000, the decision produced an annual pension shortfall of about $16 million, Prignano said. He developed a timetable to bring the payment level back up to 100 percent. The letter Cianci was referring to is dated Aug. 23, 2002, exactly two weeks before Cianci would be removed for office once again, this time after being convicted of racketeering conspiracy. In the letter, Prignano writes about Cianci's support for ""a four-year plan that my office proposed in fiscal 2000 to fully fund the annual pension contribution according to the amount recommended by the actuary."" In other words, Prignano explained in his interview with PolitiFact, Cianci had agreed to the timetable for bringing the funding back to 100 percent of the city's ARC. The percentage the city was paying started to rise -- albeit very slowly -- in 2000. The biggest increases didn't come until Cianci left office. And as Prignano acknowledged, it wouldn't hit 100 percent until 2007, five years after Cianci left, when David Cicilline was mayor. Cianci said that when he talked about funding the pension system at 100 percent, he was referring to 100 percent of the amount recommended by Prignano, not the full 100 percent of the annual required contribution. Our ruling Cianci said, ""In 2001 and '02 . . . we had the pension system funded at [the] 100 percent level in that year, and we did for two years at that point."" But the last full contribution to the system under Cianci was in 1996. During the last years of his term, he short-changed the system each year by more than a third of the money it would ultimately need. That would have a long-term deleterious impact on the health of the pension plan. Cianci contends his ""100 percent"" remark referred to a plan to eventually restore the funding level. But although he had ample time to explain that during the ""Newsmaker"" interview, he never made that clear. And viewers likely came away with the false impression that Cianci had given the pension fund the full amount it needed in those years. We rate Cianci's claim False.

Gillespie ad falsely tags Warner with PolitiFact's 'Lie of the Year' award
","A TV ad by Ed Gillespie, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, indicates incumbent Mark Warner has received PolitFact’s most ignoble rating: ""The Lie of the Year."" The commercial starts with footage from a videotape Warner posted on Aug. 10, 2009, laying out his qualified support for health care reform. At the time, Congress was considering Obamacare -- also known as the Affordable Care Act -- and there was loud debate over whether the bill would strip people of health insurance policies they liked and wanted to keep. ""Let me make clear, I’m not going to support a health care reform plan that’s going to take away health care that you’ve got right now or a health care plan that you like,"" Warner said in the 2009 video. While Warner is saying this, the words ""LIE OF THE YEAR"" appear in red capital letters and, underneath them, in black caps, is the attribution to ""POLITIFACT, 12/12/13."" The Lie of the Year is awarded each December by our colleagues at PolitiFact National. Gillespie’s claim that Warner took the title last year was news to us because the dubious distinction went to President Barack Obama’s statements that under that ACA, ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it."" Obama had repeated that vow at least 37 times since 2009, including during his re-election campaign in 2012. Those promises unraveled last fall when insurers informed millions of Americans who buy their own coverage -- as opposed to getting it through work -- that their policies were being cancelled because they did not meet the ACA’s minimum standards. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, essentially told us the ad claim is fair because the promises by Warner and Obama were identical. Logan said the Lie of the Year was not directed specifically at the president, but to anyone who made the like-it, keep-it claim. PolitiFact National’s article announcing the Lie of the Year, however, only refers to the White House’s repetition of the false claim. It notes that when insurers started cancelling policies last fall, Obama’s first reaction was to deny he made a blanket promises that people could keep their pre-existing coverage. ""For all those reasons, PolitiFact has named `If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,’ the Lie of the Year for 2013,’"" our colleagues wrote. PolitiFact National also specified that the distinction went to Obama’s statements in a follow-up article -- which Logan also sent us -- detailing national reaction to the award. So it’s clear that Gillespie’s campaign took liberty in interpreting the PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year. There are important distinctions between Obama’s comments and Warner’s. Gillespie’s campaign is circulating tapes of two events where Warner pledged not to vote for a bill that would take away existing insurance plans: the video used in the ad and one from a September 2009 town hall meeting in Fredericksburg. Both of those recordings occurred when the ACA was being drafted. Warner was speaking about his conditions for supporting legislation; he was not offering a long-term guarantee on how the law would work.   Warner wound up voting for a bill that contained language shielding existing policies from meeting the minimum ACA coverage standards, but leaving it to the White House to fill in the details. Obama subsequently imposed tough regulations that blocked insurers from adjusting the grandfathered plans to market conditions or selling them to new customers, all but assuring the death of substandard policies. Warner says he was surprised by the president’s actions. Obama repeated his like-it, keep-it line long after he imposed regulations that guaranteed the law wouldn’t work that way. The White House published the rules in June 2010 with a chart estimating between 39 percent and 69 percent of employers with grandfathered plans would relinquish them by 2013. Unlike Obama, we’ve come across no record of Warner making a like-it, keep-it statement past 2009. Our ruling Gillespie’s ad indicates PolitiFact National branded Warner with the ""Lie of the Year"" in 2013 for promising four years earlier that he wouldn’t vote for health care reforms that took away insurance plans people like. PolitiFact National never mentioned Warner in handing out the award. In articles and videos, our colleagues focused the award on Obama’s insistence over the years that under the ACA, ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it."" The statements and the circumstances behind them are not clones. The president had far greater power in shaping the law that bears his name than the senator. Warner didn’t repeat his pledge after he voted for the ACA in 2009. Obama continued to make his vow long after he added regulations to the law in mid-2010 that guaranteed the ACA would end some pre-existing insurance plans.   The clear implication of Gillespie’s ad -- that PolitiFact cited Warner for telling the Lie of the Year -- is simply False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD04380>],/factchecks/2014/sep/28/ed-gillespie/gillespie/

Do other countries have a higher minimum wage than the United States?
","One of the most popular Democratic talking points this campaign season has been to call for an increase in the minimum wage. A social-media meme that’s been circulating recently provides a justification for hiking the minimum wage -- namely that the minimum wage in the United States falls well below that of other advanced industrialized nations. Here’s the text on the meme, which Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., among others, put on his Facebook feed: ""Minimum wages around the world in U.S. dollars: Denmark $21/hr., Australia $15.81/hr., Germany $11/hr., France $12.35/hr. United States $7.25/hr. Share if you agree we should catch up with the rest of the world."" We wondered how accurate the meme was, so we took a look. Using foreign-exchange rates There are two major methods for comparing minimum wages between countries. The meme uses the most basic way -- using exchange rates to convert the wage amount from the foreign country’s currency to U.S. dollars. Using this method, the meme isn’t perfect, but it’s pretty close. Australia’s minimum wage was recently raised to 16.87 per hour in Australian dollars. At current exchange rates, that’s $14.81 in U.S. dollars -- a little lower than the $15.81 cited in the meme, but still well above the United States’ rate of $7.25 an hour. Germany recently established a national minimum wage for the first time, at 8.5 Euros per hour. (Previously, Germany had a patchwork of different rates.) That works out to $10.79 in U.S. dollars, not far from the $11 cited in the meme, and still quite a bit higher than the minimum wage in the United States. In France, the minimum wage is currently 9.53 Euros, which works out to $12.10. That’s pretty close to the $12.35 in the meme, and it’s well above the U.S. minimum wage. Of the four countries cited in the meme, the description of Denmark is the least accurate. There is actually no minimum wage in Denmark, according to a summary published by the U.S. State Department. According to that summary, ""unions and employer associations negotiate minimum wages. The average minimum wage for all private and public sector collective bargaining agreements was approximately DKK 110 ($20) per hour, exclusive of pension benefits."" In other words, the Danish ""minimum wage"" of $20 or $21 is actually an average of all minimum wages across a variety of sectors. That means many Danish workers will be working in companies or industries that have a ""minimum wage"" lower than $20 or $21. And that undercuts the notion of a ""minimum wage,"" which is supposed to be a floor for wages. So, using foreign-exchange rates, the meme is pretty close for Australia, France and Germany, and somewhat misleading on Denmark. But that’s not the only method you can use. Using purchasing power parity Taking exchange rates into account takes care of one problem related to comparing one country’s minimum wage to another. Untouched, though, is the difference in the cost of living between one country and the other. This difference can be handled by using what’s called ""purchasing power parity,"" or ""PPP."" If there’s a higher wage but also a higher cost of living in a given country, factoring in purchasing power parity will adjust for that. In two of the four countries -- Australia and France -- factoring in purchasing power parity reduces the gap between the United States’ minimum wage and that of the other country. (We could not find equivalent data for Denmark or Germany.) The data comes from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a research group for advanced industrialized countries. OECD reports that in Australia, the PPP-adjusted minimum wage is $10.20, rather than the $15.81 shown in the meme. Meanwhile, France’s PPP-adjusted minimum wage works out to $10.60, rather than $12.35 as in the meme. That’s a 36 percent reduction in the figure for Australia and a 14 percent reduction for France. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, says a PPP-adjusted wage is preferable for this sort of comparison. ""Most economists agree that the PPP exchange rate offers a better measure of the standard-of-living comparison between countries than does the commercial exchange rate,"" he said. ""Also, PPP exchange rates fluctuate less from year to year than commercial exchange rates."" Our ruling The meme says that countries with a higher minimum wage than the United States’ $7.25 an hour include Denmark at $21, Australia at $15.81, Germany at $11 and France at $12.35. The figure for Denmark is questionable because the country has no single minimum wage. Meanwhile, the figures for the four other countries have been converted into U.S. dollars, but they do not take into account differences in the cost of living in each country -- in other words, how far that wage would go in purchasing goods and services. Economists tend to favor taking purchasing power into account when doing cross-country comparisons of this sort. When purchasing power is taken into account, the gap between the other countries and the United States narrows, though it does not disappear. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB20D00>],/factchecks/2014/sep/26/facebook-posts/do-other-countries-have-higher-minimum-wage-united/

Scott Walker says tax cuts amount to $322 for average family
","Engaged in a tight re-election duel with Democrat Mary Burke, Gov. Scott Walker is returning to a theme that’s been a constant in his career. Tax cuts. In a new TV ad, the first-term Republican governor peers into the camera and declares: ""Thanks to our reforms, the average family will have an extra $322 to spend."" Walker then asks: ""What are you going to do with your savings?"" A series of regular-lookin’ folks enthusiastically answer: Buy clothes and school supplies, buy 96 gallons of gas, new truck tires, 2,700 diapers. Burke has criticized Walker’s tax cuts as tilted to the rich. We rated Half True her claim that Walker cut ""taxes for the wealthiest"" and raised taxes ""on 140,000 Wisconsin families."" That claim left out important information, namely that Walker has also cut income taxes across the board. So, what about Walker’s claim of $322 in savings for an ""average family."" When we asked Walker spokesman Tom Evenson for back up for the $322 figure, he pointed to a series of income tax cuts and property tax relief policies enacted by Walker and GOP lawmakers. Evensen said the figure is based on an ""average family"" as having four people and a median household income of $81,000. The time frame for the claimed savings, he said, is the 2014 tax year. U.S. Census figures show that a family of four in Wisconsin has a median income of that amount, or slightly higher. A family of four is a common measuring stick. About one in five family households in Wisconsin is that size. But according to the census bureau, a family of two is much more common, making up almost half of those households. There are also more three-person households than four-person ones. More notably, we found the median income across all family sizes in Wisconsin is lower than what Walker used -- $65,618. Because it’s a broader figure, it’s arguably a more representative ""average family"" income. ""To figure out a typical tax cut for a typical Wisconsin family, the $65,618 figure would be the income figure to use,  said Tamarine Cornelius, analyst at the Wisconsin Budget Project, a program at the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families. Let’s see how this plays out under both scenarios. We’ll break our calculations into the two major parts -- property taxes and income taxes. Property taxes Special injections of state property tax relief provided in the form of aid to schools  and technical colleges helped drop the property tax bill for a median-valued home taxed at statewide average rates. That hypothetical, ""average"" property owner will see a decrease of $151 on the 2014 property tax bill compared to what they would have without the relief measures, according to estimates from the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Not every family at the average income level will see that savings. For one thing, not every family owns a home or property. And while the Fiscal Bureau estimate is widely cited by both parties as an illustration of  changes in property taxes statewide, the bottom line on tax changes can vary widely depending on a variety of factors at the municipal level. Income taxes Using Walker’s ""average family"" income figure of $81,000, the income tax cuts enacted under Walker would top $200 in 2014, based on our reading of the Fiscal Bureau’s analysis of two income tax rate reductions enacted under Walker. At the $65,618 income figure, the average tax owed would drop more than $185. Bottom line Combining the two types of tax cuts shows a reduction of more than $330 in 2014 for a property-owning family at the median income level for Wisconsin families. Using the higher ""average family"" income for four people -- the one cited by Walker -- pushes the average savings over $350. Either way, the figures support the ad’s claim of $322. Our rating Walker tells TV viewers that ""Thanks to our reforms, the average family will have an extra $322 to spend."" Using some solid sources, the governor accurately pegs the combined estimated savings for a median-income family from his income- and property-tax cuts. The claim needs clarification, though, because not every average family is in circumstances to receive a cut of that size, particularly if they are not property owners. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4E9B84A00>],/factchecks/2014/sep/26/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-tax-cuts-amount-322-average-fami/

Perdue fails in attempt to tar Nunn for terrorist link
","With Election Day just about five weeks away, and polls consistently showing a tight race with national implications, the battle to become Georgia’s next U.S. senator has turned ugly. In a newly released television ad that carries echoes of the late-campaign attacks that pundits said worked during the GOP runoff, Republican candidate David Perdue goes after Democrat Michelle Nunn for a supposed weakness on border security. Before he gets to that though, a narrator opens with a simple statement: ""Michelle Nunn’s own plan says she funded organizations linked to terrorists."" If that wasn’t clear enough, an overlay in all capital writing spells out what it calls an ""exact quote"" from a Nunn campaign document: ""awards to inmates, terrorists."" A simple sentence but serious implications. Is the ad right, that Michelle Nunn admits to financial ties to terrorists? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a close look.  The conservative National Review revealed in July that it had a 144-page series of Nunn campaign memos from last December. The story broke about a week after Perdue won the Republican nomination, in part by attacking rival U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston as ""pro-amnesty"" and in the pocket of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The leaked memos lay out Nunn's campaign strategy and include, among other things, detailed fundraising plans, a public relations strategy and list of anticipated attacks in the race. In those anticipated attacks and vulnerabilities is the reference to ""service awards to inmates, terrorists"" during her Points of Light tenure. The plan called for her team to have ""pushback"" documents ready for those anticipated issues as well as common, more broad attacks leveled against Democratic candidates. That means Nunn’s camp correctly predicted the GOP would attack her on the issue, not that there is a connection to be made. And about that connection?  Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey said the statement was based first on Nunn’s leaked documents and then cited a National Review story following up on the leak as evidence of the terrorist connection. ""This isn’t something that we pulled out of thin air,"" Dickey said. The story refers to a link that PolitiFact Georgia already ruled as Mostly False when used in an attack ad from Ending Spending Action Fund. The Super PAC– which at nearly $2.8 million has injected the most outside money into the Georgia Senate race  – centered its attack on MissionFish, a business that Points of Light owned until 2012 that collected donations from eBay users for about 20,000 charities. One of those charities, Islamic Relief USA, received about $13,500 in donations from MissionFish, and has partnered with the umbrella group Islamic Relief Worldwide (IRW) on disaster relief programs. A top Israeli defense official has accused IRW of having links to the terrorist group Hamas, and in June, the defense minister banned it from operating there. In 2012, one British bank closed an IRW account over counter-terrorism concerns. But the U.S. State Department does not consider the group a terrorist organization or front. The United Kingdom Charity Commission, which regulates IRW, also has found no such ties.  The nonprofit released a statement following Israel’s ban, adamantly denying any links to terrorism. Islamic Relief USA, meanwhile, earns a perfect score from Charity Navigator for its transparency and accounting. The group does give grants to IRW for humanitarian programs in developing countries, as it does with other groups, said advocacy counsel Sharif Aly. But it also works with the American Red Cross and other charities in disaster relief, such as an ongoing effort to help with flooding in the Detroit area. ""We are not terrorists and we do not support terrorism,"" Aly said. ""Any money disbursed, inside or outside the United States, follows all regulations to ensure that."" Nunn declined to be drawn into the debate this summer, when the memo was first unveiled. She did tell the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the memos, including the anticipated attacks, were more advice from supporters than a strict campaign blueprint. Nunn spokesman Nathan Click told PolitiFact Georgia that of course Nunn ""absolutely"" did not support terrorism or have any connections to terrorists. ""That is not what the memo says,"" Click said. ""It anticipates attacks that mischaracterize her record and distort her experience. That’s exactly what has happened."" So where does that leave us with an attack that states as fact that Michelle Nunn’s own internal documents says she funded organizations that have terrorist ties? The Perdue ad plainly misconstrues what the Nunn internal memos said and why. PolitiFact Georgia has already ruled that tying Nunn’s nonprofit work to terrorism is off base. The effort to make the connection by incorrectly citing her campaign’s leaked memos verges on the ridiculous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBAD50C0>],/factchecks/2014/sep/26/david-perdue/perdues-attempt-tar-nunn-terrorist-link-fails/

Begich's record on illegal immigration a target in Alaska Senate race
","Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, says he doesn’t support amnesty for illegal immigrants -- but his opponent Republican Dan Sullivan says Begich cast a ""deciding vote"" that proves he does. Last week, the Senate briefly squabbled over immigration legislation, eventually blocking a Republican proposal from coming to a vote. Now, Republicans are using that as ammunition. Begich voted to block the proposal. In a Sept. 19, 2014, email to supporters, the Sullivan campaign framed this as a blatant contradiction to what Begich has said in the past. ""Yesterday Sen. Mark Begich cast the deciding vote in favor of President (Barack) Obama’s authority to issue executive amnesty to illegal aliens,"" the email says. ""Yeah, I couldn’t believe it either. Especially after he told Alaskans he was against executive amnesty."" The way it’s phrased, Sullivan’s statement makes it sound like Begich voted ""Yes"" on a bill that approves Obama’s authority to give amnesty to illegal immigrants. Based on our research, that’s not what happened. What was this vote? The chain of causality is pretty tangled, but we’ll try to break it down succinctly. On Sept. 18, Congress passed a bill that funds the government through mid December, including allocations to equip and train Syrian rebels. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., wanted to attach an amendment to the bill that would have stripped down the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program (more on the specifics of the amendment later). However, they couldn’t propose their amendment. Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., had filled the bill up with his own amendments -- effectively blocking any others from consideration. Cruz and Sessions asked for a vote to table (kill) one of Reid’s amendments to make room for their proposal. The Senate voted exactly 50-50, with Begich voting ""no."" The measure needed 51 votes to pass, so it failed, and the Cruz-Sessions proposal never made it to the floor. Both conservative and liberal media outlets have played this as a vote either for or against Obama’s immigration authority. It’s possible that some senators voted ""no"" on this measure because they do not support the Cruz-Sessions amendment, but it’s not a given. Begich’s campaign said he did not support the procedural measure because it would have slowed consideration of the primary bill, which Begich opposed. In sum: The Senate did not vote on a bill that addressed Obama’s ""executive amnesty.""  They voted on whether or not they should kill an amendment that addressed numbering in another amendment. The deciding vote? The Cruz-Sessions measure was one vote away from passing. The tally split almost evenly along party lines, except for five Democrats -- four of whom are up for re-election -- who sided with Republicans. Begich sided with Democrats, but was his the ""deciding vote""? We’ve checked many, many claims that say a Democrat cast the deciding vote for the Affordable Care Act. Usually, those claims rate a Mostly False. In order for the measure to pass, it needed every vote up to and including the tiebreaker, so it leaves out a lot of context to designate one individual as the ultimate tiebreaker. The same logic applies here. It’s easy to pin blame on Begich because he is a Democrat running for re-election in a red state, so he likely felt pressure to vote both ways. In an interview with Politico, he joked that he possibly could have been swayed to vote with the Republicans but ultimately decided against it. But that doesn’t mean Begich is the only senator who was on the fence. Amnesty? Whether or not the Cruz-Sessions amendment addresses ""executive amnesty"" -- as Sullivan’s comment says -- is almost a moot point because Begich never voted on it. We want to hash it out anyway. The amendment -- a version of which passed the House in August -- would have stripped funding from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and prevented it from being expanded upon. The program is aimed at young people who arrived in the United States illegally as children. (They’re sometimes referred to as ""Dreamers"" because legislation that would permanently address their status is known as the DREAM Act.) Experts disagree on whether or not the Deferred Action program can be considered ""executive amnesty."" It is an executive program, to be sure -- Obama and the Department of Homeland Security established the program in 2012. It allows people who were brought to the United States as children and meet other requirements to apply for a two-year deportation deferral and work permit, which can be renewed. (Sullivan’s statement makes it seem like the entire illegal immigrant population is in play.) ""In the immigration context, amnesty is anything that lets an illegal alien stay legally,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels. With this definition, Krikorian said Deferred Action is a two-year amnesty program. On the other side, immigration policy attorney Kamal Essaheb said Deferred Action is not amnesty because it doesn’t permanently prevent someone from being deported. Nor does it absolve them from their crime of entering the country illegally. A more accurate descriptor is ""prosecutorial discretion"" because it helps prioritize deportation cases -- of which there are too many for the courts to realistically handle, said Essaheb, who works for the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group.   We asked several experts about this and heard both arguments multiple times. We searched news databases and couldn’t find any Begich commentary on the Deferred Action program specifically. However, he has said he doesn’t support the president using executive action to give illegal immigrants amnesty. At a debate in Anchorage last month, Begich and Sullivan were asked if they would support the president taking executive action on giving amnesty to illegal immigrants, according to local publication News-Miner. ""No. Congress needs to be a part of it,"" Begich said. (Sullivan said, ""No way."") Our ruling Sullivan said Begich ""cast the deciding vote in favor of President Obama’s authority to issue executive amnesty to illegal aliens."" Begich never voted on this question. In reality, Begich voted ""no"" on a procedural measure, along with 49 other senators. As a result, a amendment regarding immigration policy did not come up for a vote. It’s debatable whether this amendment really addressed ""executive amnesty,"" and it had little chance of passing even if it hadn’t been blocked. Begich’s vote did not increase Obama’s authority, as Sullivan’s statement makes it seem. Rather, it maintained the status quo. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBAFD840>],/factchecks/2014/sep/25/dan-sullivan/begichs-record-illegal-immigration-target-alaska-s/

Fox analyst: Airstrikes in Syria conducted at night to 'minimize terrorist casualties'
","U.S. fighter pilots and drones launched their assault on terrorist-linked spots in Syria early Sept. 23, 2014, under the cover of darkness. Retired Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, who appears frequently on Fox News as the network’s ""strategic analyst,"" said that was done by design. But not for the reason you might think. ""You think the time of day for these strikes is significant. Why?"" Fox News’ Bill Hemmer asked Peters on America’s Newsroom on Sept. 24. ""Well, it really, really mattered,"" Peters said. ""And I think the media were so enraptured with dramatic footage of the cruise missile launches and the before and after photos that they missed the fundamental point: that Obama had restrictions on this air operation to minimize not just civilian (casualties), but to minimize terrorist casualties. ""He didn't want bloodshed, so we attacked in the middle of the night. Now the only reason you’d attack in the middle of the night is if there is a forbidding air defense complex and you’re worried about it -- there were no air defenses in the areas we attacked. The Syrians certainly weren't going to turn on anything they had. ISIS doesn't have them. You could have gone in there safely in a hang glider. But instead we went in the middle of the night. Why? Because the buildings were empty."" Did America really target terrorist strongholds at night only as a way to avoid killing terrorists? We found that there are plenty of other possible explanations for a night-time attack. Peters, in an interview with PunditFact, stood by his comments. ""In the past we attacked at night to reduce the capability of the enemy's air-defense systems to target our aircraft,"" he said. ""In this case, there was no air-defense threat in the areas held by Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL)."" A spokesman for U.S. Central Command was reluctant to discuss operations in Syria, pointing out the goal of taking out the terrorists’ infrastructure -- access to oil refineries, financial centers, radio dishes, transportation corridors, training sites, etc. -- that has made Syria a ""safe haven"" for terrorism, as Obama has said. The strikes against Islamic State and Khorasan were along the northern Turkish border and IS’ Raqqa headquarters. CentCom released videos of attacks near al Tabqah, a refinery, and ISIS vehicle storage location. Night attacks are standard procedure, and Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom all started in a similar manner, said retired Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula, the principal attack planner for the Operation Desert Storm air campaign and commander of the combined air operation center for Operation Enduring Freedom. ""The bottom line is, if you go back and look historically, we generally do strike first at night because there is a surprise factor, and folks aren’t expecting it,"" said Deptula, also dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, a Washington-based research group founded by the Air Force Association. Michael O’Hanlon, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and co-director of the institution’s Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence, agreed with Deptula’s point, saying a night attack would cloak the otherwise visual giveaway and prevent terrorists from using cell phones to spread word of a looming aerial threat. ""I think that's a more credible theory than Ralph's in this case,"" O’Hanlon said. While there is little doubt that the Defense Department is trying to minimize civilian casualties, ""I disagree on the point about desiring to minimize terrorist casualties,"" said retired Air Force Col. Mark Gunzinger, who works at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. ""I actually find that a rather strange comment."" Another reason for a night attack, experts told us, is American aircraft enjoy their biggest advantage when they fly at night, as U.S. pilots are trained to wear night vision goggles and perform low-visibility military assignments. Peters, for the most part, did describe the air defense capabilities of Syria and the Islamic State correctly, experts said. Given Syria’s mutual problem with the Islamic State, it’s unlikely the Syrian Integrated Air Defense System would threaten U.S. warplanes en route to ISIS targets, said Christopher Harmer, an Institute for the Study of War senior naval analyst with the Middle East Security Project. ISIS’ air defense is basic and includes some large caliber anti-aircraft cannons, he said. ""These rudimentary air defense systems are completely ineffective at night,"" Harmer said. ""Although they are not much of a threat, flying at night minimizes that risk as well."" Our ruling Peters said that the United States launched airstrikes against terrorist targets at night ""to minimize terrorist casualties."" He said the only reason for a night-time attack would be to hit empty buildings. One of the principles of PunditFact is that people who make factual claims are accountable for their words and should be able to provide evidence to back them up. In this case, Peters’ evidence appears to be speculation based on his knowledge of past airstrikes. However, several experts detailed other reasons why the United States would strike at night. The ultimate motives are unknown, but lack of information casts a big shadow over Peters’ claim. We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7EAE00>],/factchecks/2014/sep/25/ralph-peters/fox-analyst-airstrikes-syria-conducted-night-minim/

Wendy Davis catches fire with incorrect claim about Greg Abbott, incest and rape
","Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis, who has been pressing Republican candidate Greg Abbott to say if he opposes abortion in all circumstances, told reporters Abbott should disavow a supporter’s comment about rape and incest. According to video posted online by KXAS-TV, NBC5 in Fort Worth, Davis said Sept. 23, 2014: ""It is not acceptable that Greg Abbott and his surrogates have referred to women who have been the victims of rape or incest as though somehow what they are confronting is a minor issue. And I am calling on them to disavow those statements and to show their respect for women in this state who have undergone the horrific and heinous crimes of rape and incest and demonstrate their respect for what those situations have placed them in, the trauma that they’ve dealt with and step away from the idea that they, not these women who may be impregnated in these circumstances, somehow are in a better place of knowing how women should handle that situation."" Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, was asked if Abbott should be accountable for a comment by someone who doesn’t work for him. She replied that Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak, whose comments she was questioning, has ""been a surrogate voice for Greg Abbott and the Greg Abbott campaign. And I think that most telling is the fact that Greg Abbott has not come forward  to disavow Matt Mackowiak’s characterization of women who have been victimized by rape and in cases of incest as though somehow they’ve suffered a minor issue."" Mackowiak (who has his own Truth-O-Meter report card) took exception to Davis’ characterization of his comments and urged us to check whether whether Abbott or his ""surrogates,"" as Davis said, referred to victims of rape or incest as if they’d experienced minor events. At issue is Mackowiak’s appearance on the Sept. 21, 2014, episode of KXAS-TV’s ""Lone Star Politics"" during which he and Davis advocate Matt Angle offered conflicting takes on how Abbott, the state attorney general, and Davis had fared in their first debate Sept. 19, 2014. On the show, Dallas Morning News reporter Gromer Jeffers asked Angle, ""Matt, do you think Wendy Davis picked up any women voters?"" ""Absolutely,"" Angle replied, saying Abbott made it clear he plans to continue defending the state against school districts who say the funding system is unconstitutional. ""And also,"" Angle said, ""he again defended his position, his extreme position, that even in cases where women are victims of rape or incest that he would impose himself and others like him in the government to decide what they do with that pregnancy."" Next, Jeffers asked Mackowiak if abortion remains a tough issue for Davis in conservative-leaning Texas. Mackowiak replied: ""It is, that’s right. Wendy Davis didn’t use the word ‘abortion’ in her announcement speech when she announced for that office and that’s for that reason. Look, Wendy Davis filibustered a bill that would have outlawed, that did outlaw, late-term abortion after five months. That is the law of the land. Texas is a pro-life state. ""We can get into minor issues that are 1 percent or 2 percent of the problem. But ultimately, Texas is a strongly pro-life state. Abbott would love to fight this campaign on that issue alone from here on out, but Wendy knows that that’s not strategically wise. Angle: ""That’s the first time I’ve heard rape or incest called a minor issue."" Mackowiak: ""It’s minor in terms of the percentage of the cases, that’s all I’m saying."" Angle: ""A victim of rape and incest is not a minor problem."" Mackowiak (nodding his head): ""OK. All right. Great. Right."" The day after Davis made this claim, Mackowiak emailed us a statement saying he’s not an Abbott surrogate and had never claimed to be. ""I do not believe rape or incest is a minor issue and never said that,"" he told us. ""For any victim of rape or incest, that brutal crime is a major and life-changing issue and the crime deserves to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Rather, I said that rape and incest are a small percentage of abortions."" Abbott campaign spokeswoman Amelia Chasse told us by email that Mackowiak hasn’t been employed or paid by Abbott’s campaign. By email to our queries, Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas said: ""Any Republican who goes on television to do post-debate spin, uses their talking points and defends their positions is an Abbott surrogate."" Petkanas said he was not aware of other Abbott surrogates making the rape-incest claim described by Davis. Our ruling Davis said Abbott and his surrogates ""have referred to women who have been the victims of rape or incest as though somehow what they are confronting is a minor issue."" Davis got this wrong various ways given that the individual in question, a Republican consultant who doesn’t work for Abbott, immediately clarified on the air he was saying few abortions occur after incidents of rape or incest. Also on the air, Mackowiak agreed with the Democrat criticizing him that rapes and incest aren’t minor things. Davis’ camp also identified no other people who declared incest and rapes to be minor things nor is there evidence Abbott said anything of the sort. Pants on Fire!

Bill Cassidy says Mary Landrieu 'put illegal immigrants ahead of veterans'
","Rep. Bill Cassidy, a Republican running for Senate in Louisiana, mixed two buzzwords of the 2014 campaign cycle — immigrants and veterans — in an ad attacking Democratic opponent Sen. Mary Landrieu. How are the two related? Cassidy said Landrieu chose to fund one but cut from the other. ""What would you choose? To fund benefits for veterans or for illegal immigrants? I would never put illegal immigrants ahead of veterans. But Mary Landrieu did,"" Cassidy said in the ad. ""Instead of fully funding veterans’ benefits, she voted to give benefits to those here illegally. No wonder she supports Barack Obama and his amnesty plan."" That’s quite the charge, but is it accurate? We decided to take a look. Cassidy is referring to the budget agreement reached in December 2013 between Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. — the top budget negotiators for their respective chambers. The bill prevented another government shutdown and provided some relief from sequestration. (Forgot about the sequester? It’s the 10-year, across-the-board budget cuts that were supposedly so deep and detested by both parties that Congress was expected to reach a grand budget compromise to avoid them, but never did.) Under the agreement, budget caps for discretionary spending are set at $1.012 trillion for fiscal year 2014 and $1.014 trillion for fiscal year 2015. For 2014, that figure is $45 billion more than it would have been under sequestration, and it’s $18 billion more for 2015. How did Congress pay for that? In part, by reducing the cost-of-living adjustments for the retirement pay of veterans under the age of 62. That provision sparked immediate blowback from veterans groups and some members of Congress. But the budget agreement passed the House on Dec. 12, 2013, overwhelmingly, 332-94. Cassidy voted for it. When the bill moved to the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., blocked any amendments so the fragile agreement could get an up-or-down vote as it passed the House (another government shutdown was looming in January). But Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., tried to reopen the amendment process so he could introduce an amendment that would have restored the pension cost-of-living reduction for veterans. To pay for increased spending caps, Sessions wanted to instead close a loophole that allowed some undocumented immigrants with children to collect the Additional Child Tax Credit. Sessions' amendment never came up for a vote. The Senate did take up a procedural vote, however, on whether to reopen the amendment process so Session’s amendment, and possibly others, could be heard. However, that vote failed on Dec. 17 largely along party lines, 54-46, with Landrieu voting with her Democratic colleagues. The next day, the bill passed the Senate on a vote of 64 to 36. Cassidy spokesman John Cummins said Landrieu in the Senate could have voted to open the budget agreement to amendments and chose not to. Cassidy did not have that opportunity in the House because Republican leadership pushed it through under structured rule, meaning no amendments were allowed. (For what it's worth, we didn't see any statements from Cassidy lamenting this.) Even if we agreed with this line of reasoning — which we don’t — it doesn’t absolve Cassidy from voting for, and defending, the same reductions to veterans benefits. As both FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker noted, on the very day the Senate passed the budget agreement, Cassidy defended the cuts to military pensions on conservative commentator Laura Ingraham’s radio show. Ingraham: ""You supported this budget deal and now we find out that military folks who have sacrificed so much are being asked yet again to sacrifice — this in terms of their pensions — and yet we can’t seem to close loopholes for welfare benefits going to illegal aliens and yet you supported this. Why?"" Cassidy: ""There are no benefit cuts to people who are retiring, there is an adjustment to their cost of living, which starts off not for all, but those who retire before age 62."" Cassidy went on to further defend the cut to military pensions as logical reforms without really touching on the second aspect of Ingraham’s question about tax credits for undocumented immigrants. Finally, the House and Senate voted to restore those cuts to veterans benefits the following February. Under the restructured agreement, anyone who signed up for military service before 2014 would not see a change to their benefits. Both Cassidy and Landrieu voted for this, and Obama signed it into law on Feb. 15. Our ruling Cassidy said, ""I would never put illegal immigrants ahead of veterans. But Mary Landrieu did."" There are several problems with this statement. First is the false dichotomy that Landrieu had a choice between funding undocumented immigrants and veterans in the budget agreement. That amendment never actually came up for a vote. But even putting that aside, Cassidy suggests that his position is vastly different than Landrieu. In fact, they both voted in favor of the same budget agreement to reduce future cost-of-living adjustments for veterans benefits (they both also voted to restore them), with Cassidy going on conservative radio to defend these cuts. Cassidy ignores his own record to inaccurately criticize Landrieu’s. That extra level of hypocrisy bumps his claim to ridiculous, and we rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9C2C40>],/factchecks/2014/sep/25/bill-cassidy/bill-cassidy-says-mary-landrieu-put-illegal-immigr/

Wendy Davis overstates what's confirmed about Abbott backer Ted Nugent
","CLARIFICATION, 4 p.m. Sept. 26, 2014: We revised the conclusion of this fact check to clarify our reasoning. The rating did not change. Democrat Wendy Davis revived a link between Republican Greg Abbott and guitar rock and roller Ted Nugent in the Sept. 19, 2014, debate between the gubernatorial nominees. The Fort Worth state senator initially mentioned her 2013 filibuster against legislation tightening restrictions on abortion in the state. ""My opponent, on the other hand, has paid women less than he has paid men,"" Davis said, likely referring to a March 18, 2014, news story in the San Antonio Express-News exploring that topic. And, Davis said, ""he has campaigned with a sexual predator who has bragged about having sex with underage girls."" By email, Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas said Davis was referring to Abbott stumping in Denton in early 2014 with rock guitarist Ted Nugent, the so-called Motor City Madman whose 1970s hits included ""Cat Scratch Fever."" Petkanas emailed: ""An adult man who has sex with underage girls is by definition a sexual predator."" We identified a legal definition using ""predator."" By email, Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, guided us to a Texas definition connected to civil commitments of individuals repeatedly convicted of sexual offenses who haven’t proved amenable to traditional mental illness treatment. A person is a ""sexually violent predator,"" this law says, if the person is a ""repeat sexually violent offender"" and ""suffers from a behavioral abnormality that makes the person likely to engage in a predatory act of sexual violence."" Nugent has no criminal convictions, according to a background check we conducted on LexisNexis. Nugent (who has his own Truth-O-Meter report card) appeared with Abbott on Feb. 18, 2014. At that time, Davis said Abbott had appeared with ""an admitted sexual predator."" Karin Johanson, then her campaign manager, went on to say Nugent ""has boasted of having sexual relations with underage women."" That day, Abbott praised Nugent’s zealous defense of gun rights and claimed ignorance of the performer’s inflammatory remarks on immigration and women. Nugent had suggested immigrants who are not in the country legally should be treated like ""indentured servants"" until they earn citizenship; he’d also referred to feminists as ""fat pigs"" and used lewd language about women in song lyrics and interviews. Nugent later apologized for referring to the Democratic president, Barack Obama, as a ""subhuman mongrel."" Appearing on WBAP Radio in Dallas, Nugent said, ""I apologize for using the street fight terminology of subhuman mongrel."" He said he should have called Obama ""violator of his Constitution, the liar that he is,"" a reference to the 2012 health law known as Obamacare. Abbott then said Nugent’s comment was ""not the kind of language I would use or endorse in any way."" Nugent has been married to his current wife, Shemane, since 1989, she says on her blog. Has he also boasted of relations with underage girls? Petkanas pointed us to a Nugent profile on the VH1 cable channel as the basis of what Davis said. The episode of ""Behind the Music,"" which debuted in April 1998, presents Nugent, in his words and comments from others, as a tee-totaling, drug-free, gun-loving performer who had had many sexual partners. We spotted a remastered version on VH1’s website, dated Jan. 30, 2012. ""I didn’t get into rock and roll to pick up women,"" Nugent says in the program. ""But I adapted."" The episode’s narrator says Nugent was divorced by the mother of two of his children in the mid-1970s in part because he was ""fighting a losing  battle with his own addiction, his weakness for young women."" ""I was addicted to girls,"" Nugent says. ""Addicted. It was hopeless. It was beautiful."" Post-divorce, Nugent, 30, paired up with a 17-year-old from Hawaii. ""She was like a dream,"" Nugent says. ""I was underage,"" the woman, says, looking back. ""And even back in the wild ‘70s, it just wasn’t a terribly appropriate situation in most people’s eyes."" The narrator says the girl’s mother even signed papers making Nugent her daughter’s legal guardian. ""Ted admits to a number of liaisons with underage girls,"" the narrator says. Petkanas also forwarded a web link to a Huffington Post article stating Courtney Love, the singer, recalled performing a sex act with the elder Nugent when she was a 12-year-old groupie. Love said so in a radio interview in March 2004, according to a March 23, 2004, New York Post news story. The Post said Nugent didn’t return its call for comment on Love’s statement. Nugent’s office didn’t engage with our email and telephone inquiries for this article. Our ruling Davis said Abbott ""has campaigned with a sexual predator who has bragged about having sex with underage girls."" Davis didn’t mention Nugent’s name, but she’s right the former rock star, who stumped for Abbott this year, has talked about sexual escapades with much younger women. Then again, we found no confirmation of Nugent explicitly saying his victims were underage. Also, Davis’ statement could have given debate viewers the misimpression Nugent is a convicted sex offender, which isn’t so. We rate the claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Crist says Scott pleaded Fifth 75 times 'to avoid jail'
","Gubernatorial campaign commercials have been digging up each candidate’s past for months, but now Gov. Rick Scott and Charlie Crist are pretty much calling each other criminals. The Republican Party of Florida, working on Scott’s behalf, had a Fort Lauderdale investor say in a TV ad that he was ""swindled"" by Crist. The man had invested with Scott Rothstein, who was later convicted of a Ponzi scheme. We rated that Pants on Fire!, because Crist had nothing to do with the plot to defraud investors. Now Crist is going after Scott’s past as the CEO of hospital chain Columbia/HCA, which in 1997 was busted by the federal government for bilking Medicare. Crist referred to the Rothstein attack in a Sept. 19, 2014, commercial, saying Scott lied to voters ""4,000 times,"" the number of times the Rothstein ad had aired on Florida TV stations. ""We shouldn’t be surprised,"" the narrator said. ""Scott pled the Fifth 75 times to avoid jail for Medicare fraud."" That’s referring to a deposition Scott gave in 2000 for an unrelated civil case. To further muddy the waters, the commercial shows footage from a deposition for yet another unrelated case in 1995. This attack should sound familiar, because it came up in the 2010 campaign, when Scott’s Republican primary opponent Bill McCollum said Scott ""barely escaped imprisonment,"" which we rated False. PolitiFact Florida wanted to revisit this angle and see if Scott, who was never charged with wrongdoing in the federal fraud case, gave vague testimony to avoid time in the cooler. The Columbia/HCA case We’ve been over this many, many times before, so let’s explain the history as quickly as possible. Scott began what eventually became Columbia/HCA in 1987, buying and merging hospitals until his publicly traded company became the nation’s largest health care chain. At its peak, the company boasted more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations in 37 states and two foreign countries. Scott’s reputation as a hard-nosed businessman came from a cutthroat corporate environment, in which the most productive managers were rewarded and the least were fired. Some employees speculated it was that culture that led to unscrupulous behavior, such as padding bills, charging Medicare for procedures that were more lucrative than what was actually performed, and giving doctors kickbacks in exchange for patient referrals. Whether Scott knew about such practices is unknown, although he apparently signed off on reports that raised concerns about things happening within the chain. Jerre Frazier, a company attorney told the Miami Herald in 2010 that Scott said the company wasn’t doing anything differently than other chains in the health care industry. Whistle-blowers exposed the fraud, helping federal investigators gather enough evidence to raid the company’s offices and hospitals in 1997. Scott was pressured to resign in July of that year, taking a $5.1 million cash severance and an additional  $300 million in stocks and options with him. (Five other top executives also resigned.) Scott has said it was because he wanted to fight the charges while the board wanted to settle, which they did in 2000 and 2002, for a total of $1.7 billion in fines and penalties. Scott was never charged with a crime. His boilerplate response to the incident is that he wasn’t even questioned by investigators, although ABC’s World News Tonight reported in 1997 he was ""considered a prime target of the investigation."" That’s not unusual, legal experts told PolitiFact, because replacing a CEO is often a first step a company makes to show the government it means business about cleaning up its wayward methods. Whether that’s exactly what happened in Scott’s case, we can’t say. Scott has addressed the case plenty, however. In a 2010 debate he called the deposition a ""fishing expedition"" he refused to participate in. He told the Tampa Bay Times that same year that he was partly culpable. ""There's no question that mistakes were made and as CEO, I have to accept responsibility for those mistakes,"" he said. ""I was focused on lowering costs and making the hospitals more efficient. I could have had more internal and external controls. I learned hard lessons, and I've taken that lesson and it's helped me become a better business person and a better leader."" Think about the clink The company agreed to plead guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies, which don’t involve jail time but did factor into the fines. Four Florida-based Columbia/HCA executives were indicted. Two were convicted of defrauding Medicare and sentenced to prison, but those verdicts were later overturned. One was acquitted, and a jury couldn’t reach a verdict on the last. Does that mean Scott faced jail at all? In pleading the Fifth Amendment, it certainly seems like a possibility, former federal prosecutor Ryan O’Quinn told us. That’s because the only legal reason to use your Fifth Amendment right in court is if you think your answer would incriminate you. The deposition in which Scott pleaded the Fifth 75 times was part of a civil case by Nevada Communications Corp., which alleged that Columbia/HCA breached the terms of a communications contract. Scott gave the deposition at his offices in Stamford, Conn., on July 27, 2000, months before the settlement with the federal government. Scott lawyer Steven Steinbach explained the strategy thusly: ""Unfortunately because of the pendency of a number of criminal investigations relating to Columbia around the country, he's going to follow my advice, out of prudence, to assert his constitutional privilege against giving testimony against himself."" While pleading the Fifth in a criminal case can’t be used as an admission of guilt, it’s just fine to assume that in a civil case. For example, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in July 2014 upheld a $67 million judgment against TD Bank for a group of investors bilked by imprisoned attorney Scott Rothstein, who has factored heavily into campaign commercials between Scott and Crist. In that ruling, the judge said jurors could infer former TD Bank South Florida regional VP Frank Spinosa knew about or participated in Rothstein’s scheme when he invoked the Fifth 193 times. Spinosa has not been charged with a crime and was no longer a bank employee, but was likely avoiding self-incrimination, or possibly as a favor to TD Bank, the ruling said.  Scott wasn’t facing a jury, but we’re trying to establish whether one could infer guilt for invoking the Fifth Amendment. In fact, there’s no other reason to think otherwise, because by the letter of the law, Scott must have thought he would incriminate himself if he answered truthfully. ""Given the adverse consequences of an assertion of the Fifth Amendment in a civil deposition, an executive must have a significant concern that their response could contribute to their criminal prosecution,"" O’Quinn said. ""A frivolous assertion of the Fifth Amendment would be an unethical act."" So if Scott was avoiding incriminating himself and other executives were actually convicted and sentenced to prison (albeit later overturned), does that mean Scott faced jail? That’s conjecture, but he certainly could have faced federal charges, which could have resulted in time in prison. There is a possibility some in the FBI regretted the decision to not go after Scott. ""After Columbia/HCA, I realized people, individual corporate officers, had to be held accountable for the actions of their companies,'' former Tampa FBI agent Joe Ford said in a book about the Columbia/HCA case. ""Instead of just giving us (the government) money, people need to go to jail. I learn from my mistakes and this was my first big one.'' Our ruling Crist said Scott ""pled the Fifth 75 times to avoid jail for Medicare fraud."" If you haven’t heard by now, Scott did invoke his Fifth Amendment rights 75 times in a deposition to avoid discussing a Medicare fraud case. But Crist’s ad is pushing the envelope to say he did it to avoid jail. No one went to prison for the Medicare fraud debacle, nor did Scott actually face the rigors of a grand jury or even federal investigators. The commercial seems to imply Scott was in the thick of the raids, when he was actually sent packing as soon as it became apparent the company faced a major punishment for defrauding the U.S. government. It’s impossible to say if Scott would have gone to jail if he had answered those deposition questions, but experts say he was certainly avoiding possible legal trouble by asserting the Fifth Amendment. We rate the statement Half True. Correction, Oct. 3, 2014, 2:30 p.m.: This version clarifies the context in which Scott asserted his Fifth Amendment right. The change does not affect the ruling.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA60CC0>],/factchecks/2014/sep/25/charlie-crist/crist-says-scott-pleaded-fifth-75-times-avoid-jail/

Austin City Council hopeful slightly off saying over 1,000 city workers earn six-figure checks
","UPDATE 6:15 p.m., Sept. 26, 2014: We revised the story below to note that at a Sept. 23, 2014, forum Wiley said almost 1,000 workers have six-figure salaries. This additional information, pointed out by a reader, didn't change our rating of the claim we checked. Rich rich rich! City of Austin employees strike it rich! Sorry. We got carried away by a claim at a forum for Austin City Council candidates thrown by the League of Women Voters and the City of Austin. According to an Austin American-Statesman news story posted online Sept. 16, 2014, a council candidate, lawyer Jay Wiley, said the day before there’s room in the city budget to staff offices in each of the 10 newly created single-member districts. Wiley, running in District 6 in Northwest Austin, also said at the forum: ""We’ve got, actually, over 1,000 city employees that make six-figure salaries."" Does that add up? We failed to reach Wiley to learn the origin of his figure. Meantime, city spokeswoman Melissa Alvarado emailed a chart indicating that as of Sept. 1, 2014, 879 workers earned from $100,089 to $304,657. To follow-up queries, Alvarado sent a chart listing 24 vacancies at that time for positions paying $100,000 or more. So, you could say the city had 903 positions paying six figures at the time Wiley spoke. Alvarado said the city then had 11,852 workers, which means its $100,000-plus earners accounted for 7 percent of its workers. Plus, more workers were heading into the six-figure class shortly. To our inquiry, Alvarado said 3.5 percent raises taking effect Sept. 21, 2014, (before the start of the new fiscal year in October) would result in 1,162 employees earning $100,000 or more. At that time, she said, the city expected there to be another 36 open positions paying more than $100,000 each. So at that time, the city projects, 1,198 positions will pay six figures. Alvarado said the city had 12,780 positions budgeted for fiscal 2015. We also looked at which city workers make the most. Peruse that sampling below. Top-Paid Employees City of Austin Sept. 1, 2014 NAME TITLE/DEPARTMENT SALARY Larry Weis General Manager/Austin Energy $304,657 Marc Ott City Manager $269,755 Paul Hinchey Medical Director/EMS System $246,688 Michael McDonald Deputy City Manager $220,126 Cheryl Mele Chief Operating Officer/Austin Energy $211,494 Kerry Overton Deputy General Manager, Shared Services/Austin Energy $211,494 Sue Edwards Assistant City Manager $203,860 Robert Goode Assistant City Manager $203,860 Humberto Lumbreras Assistant City Manager $203,860 Anthony Snipes Assistant City Manager $203,860 Reynaldo Arellano Assistant City Manager $200,116 Art Acevedo Police Chief $199,118 Claire Hart Chief Financial Officer $206,003 Elizabeth Little Senior Vice President/Austin Energy $202,716 Jose Cabanas Rivera Deputy Medical Director, Office of the Medical Director $200,969 Source: Information provided by City of Austin, September 2014. The full chart is here. After we initially posted this fact check, a reader pointed out thar Wiley said at a Sept. 23, 2014, forum the city has ""almost 1,000"" workers earning six-figure salaries. Our ruling Wiley said more than 1,000 city workers make six-figure salaries. When he spoke, 879 workers earned more than $100,000, meaning he overshot.

Lizza says Obama has bombed more nations than Bush
","The irony of President Barack Obama, Nobel Prize winner and putative anti-war candidate, launching extensive airstrikes in Syria, quickly led to comparisons with his predecessor, President George W. Bush. Ryan Lizza, Washington correspondent for the New Yorker summed it up in one tweet. ""Countries bombed: Obama 7, Bush 4."" We asked Lizza for his list and he sent us this: Bush: Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Somalia.

Obama: Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria. As we fact-checked Lizza’s statement, we found little reason to challenge the nations he named. If anything, he shortchanged both presidents. There is no dispute whatsoever about airstrikes in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. Bush launched wars in the first two countries and drone strikes in Pakistan have been in the news for a long time, with or without official acknowledgment. Airstrikes in those places continued under Obama. Somalia falls largely in the same category as Pakistan. The New York Times, BBC News and other news organizations reported airstrikes as early as 2007 against people linked to the al-Qaida network.   The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit news service based at City University London, maintains a running list of U.S. military actions in a number of countries, including Somalia and Yemen. The bureau annotates each incident with links to press reports. By its tally, American drone strikes against suspected terrorists in Somalia occurred under both Bush and Obama. The same pattern holds in Yemen. BBC News and Time magazine reported a CIA-directed drone attack in Yemen in 2002. This would increase Bush’s total to five countries, rather than the four Lizza cited. Lizza said he left Yemen off of Bush’s list because it was a ""one-off strike, rather than a more sustained bombing campaign. Probably deserves an asterisk."" The air attacks on Libya that helped topple Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 under Obama are well documented. In March 2011, the United States and British warships fired over 100 cruise missiles to destroy Libyan air defenses. And, of course, there’s now Syria. We might stop there but it is possible that the Philippines should be added to the rosters for both presidents. The New York Times cites ""three current and former intelligence officials"" as saying that drones fired Hellfire missiles at a suspected militant camp in the Philippines in 2006. And Akbar Ahmed, a professor at the American University School of International Service, wrote on the Brookings Institution website that a similar attack took place in 2012. If these reports are accurate, the totals for Bush and Obama would rise by one. The final, maximum number would be Bush 6: Obama 8. PunditFact cannot confirm the authenticity of these reports. This framework says little about the nature of each president’s air campaigns. According to Air Force data, the number of munitions dropped in Afghanistan and Iraq declined about 35 percent between 2007 under Bush and 2009 under Obama (adjusted for missing data in 2009). However in Afghanistan, the number of sorties with at least one weapon release and the number of munitions used rose in 2010 and 2011 before falling in 2012, according to Air Force data. The number of weapon releases fell greatly in 2013. The country tally also tells us nothing about the general military strategy under each president. Bush initiated the war in Iraq, while Obama was elected on the promise to end it. Our ruling Lizza said that Obama has bombed seven countries to Bush’s four. Depending on your view of Bush’s reported drone strike into Yemen, he may have slightly undercounted Bush’s tally. Both presidents also may have bombed the Philippines. But it's hard to fault Lizza for the numbers we use.  We rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE0C240>],/factchecks/2014/sep/25/ryan-lizza/lizza-says-obama-has-bombed-more-nations-bush/
