Manufacturers are not shipping COVID-19 vaccines with ‘varying ingredients’
","The ingredients of COVID-19 vaccines are safe, publicly available, and scrutinized by regulators. Yet, in some corners of social media, they are claimed to be ""secret,"" ""illegal,"" and ""toxic."" Now, they are said to be ever-changing. ""Growing mountains of evidence show that PHARMA (Pfizer, Moderna, J&J) are shipping lots of jabs with varying ingredients, potency & EVEN placebo lots,"" says a post shared recently on Facebook.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It links to a video featuring German conspiracy theorist Reiner Fuellmich, who has repeatedly spread misinformation during the pandemic. He has previously claimed that COVID-19 is less dangerous than the common flu, that the pandemic was schemed by global elites to control people, that PCR tests are fabricated evidence to justify coercive measures, and that residents of a nursing home in Germany died because of the vaccine, not the virus. His claims about ingredients, potency, and placebos are as baseless as his previous allegations, according to the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency that regulates vaccines in the United States. ""These claims are false,"" the FDA told PolitiFact. ""We are confident in the safety, effectiveness and manufacturing data behind each COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorization."" The FDA demands that vaccines go through quality-control tests that evaluate ""critical vaccine qualities"" like purity and potency to determine their safety and effectiveness. It also checks any changes made to the formula or dosage of vaccines. Pfizer did modify the composition of its vaccine recently, adding an ingredient that allows the product to be stored for longer. But the core ingredients of the shot have remained the same, and the new one is not dangerous and is commonly used in vaccines, according to a fact-check of a similar claim by USA Today. The change was checked and approved by the FDA, which said in a press release that the new formula ""does not present safety or effectiveness concerns."" A spokesperson for Pfizer told PolitiFact that it does not ship vaccines with varying ingredients or potency and that ""the approved vaccine is the only one shipped."" The company also said that placebo injections are only sent to health facilities that are doing trials. ""Otherwise, no placebos are shipped to recipients."" Moderna did not answer a request for comment, and Johnson & Johnson did not answer specific questions about ingredients, potency, and placebos, but there is no credible evidence to support the idea that they are shipping varying batches of vaccines. Health professionals have previously given saline injections instead of the proper COVID-19 vaccine to patients in Canada, Scotland, Germany, and Australia, but those accidents were the result of mix-ups by health professionals. A Facebook post claims that vaccine manufacturers are shipping COVID-19 shots with different formulas and strengths, and that some lots are coming with placebos. 
  The FDA said that the claims are wrong, and Pfizer said that it does not change the composition or strength of its vaccines between lots, and that it does not ship placebo injections widely. The claim was originally made by a conspiracy theorist who has repeatedly spread falsehoods during the pandemic.  We rate the post False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809695EF00>],/factchecks/2022/jan/31/facebook-posts/manufacturers-are-not-shipping-covid-19-vaccines-v/

DeSantis doesn't tell full story about evidence for FDA move on monoclonal antibody treatments
","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has prioritized access to monoclonal antibody treatments as a way to help Floridians deal with COVID-19 while downplaying the use of vaccines as a way to minimize infections.  So when the federal government announced it was reducing deliveries of two of these treatments because of the omicron outbreak, DeSantis was mad. The state health department said it would be forced to close 25 sites that were administering monoclonals to people in the early stage of COVID-19. DeSantis said the call was based on President Joe Biden’s ""whims."" ""Without a shred of clinical data to support its decision, the Biden Administration has revoked the emergency use authorization for lifesaving monoclonal antibody treatments,"" he tweeted.   DeSantis has a point that clinical data did not drive the decision. But that obscures a number of lab studies and admissions from the drugmakers themselves that these treatments were not helping people infected by the omicron variant — nowadays, that’s what almost every COVID-19 patient has. In other words, these drugs were no longer ""lifesaving."" Earlier in the pandemic, access to monoclonal antibody treatment was scarce. Former President Donald Trump praised one of the treatments, made by Regeneron, for his recovery after he caught the coronavirus in October 2020, but it was not widely available at the time.  This type of therapy, infused with an IV, or administered via subcutaneous injection, is most effective when given quickly after a COVID-19 diagnosis. Ideally, it makes symptoms more manageable and keeps people out of the hospital. As the treatments became more available, the FDA authorized their use for people 12 and older with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and who were at risk of developing severe illness.  Regeneron and Eli Lilly made two of the more well-known monoclonal antibody treatments. But on Jan. 24, the Food and Drug Administration restricted their use ""to only when the patient is likely to have been infected with or exposed to a variant that is susceptible to these treatments."" According to CDC surveillance, more than 99.9% of COVID-19 cases in the country are omicron. Unlike previous strains, the disease caused by this variant does not respond as well to these two monoclonal antibody drugs.  ""Data show these treatments are highly unlikely to be active against the omicron variant, which is circulating at a very high frequency throughout the United States,"" the FDA said. Limiting the use of these treatments ""avoids exposing patients to side effects, such as injection site reactions or allergic reactions, which can be potentially serious."" Both Eli Lilly and Regeneron acknowledged that their drugs were ineffective against omicron.  DeSantis said in a press conference that some people could still be contracting the delta variant of COVID-19, and they deserve access to the drugs. And COVID has a 99% survival rate. That’s not an argument to “do nothing,” right? So why is the CDC’s “99% omicron” assertion such a compelling argument to stop treating patients? https://t.co/5aS3dywodl The thing is, it is difficult to say which strain of COVID-19 a person has without more advanced lab testing. A rapid or PCR test will not reveal whether someone has the delta or omicron variant. The FDA announcement did not rule out monoclonal antibody treatments altogether. Sotromivab, a monoclonal antibody made by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology, is still in play. Three other drugs may also be used to treat infections: Paxlovid and molnupiravir, which are pill medications obtained through a prescription, and Veklury (remdesivir), an antiviral drug given by IV infusion. While the federal government pulled back on its shipments of the Eli Lilly and Regeneron drugs, it’s ramping up the distribution of others. An FDA spokesperson said the government is sending  more than 3,200 doses of sotromivab to Florida for the last week of January. That’s in addition to 4,680 doses of the preventative treatment Evusheld, more than 21,000 doses of mulnipiravir and more than 5,200 doses of Paxlovid. All together, Florida is set to receive over 34,000 doses of medicine for the week that ends Jan. 30. DeSantis talked about the absence of ""clinical data,"" which is a careful choice of words. Clinical data is collected and analyzed in real time from patients or through clinical trials involving people.  But this obscures the volume of lab evidence showing the two drugs were ineffective against omicron. ""Evidence from lab tests is not the same as clinical evidence, which the governor’s tweet referenced,"" said DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw. ""We have seen patients are still benefiting from monoclonal antibody treatment."" According to studies listed in FDA fact sheets for both drugs, Eli Lilly’s treatment was nearly 3,000 times less effective against omicron, and Regeneron’s was more than 1,000 times less effective. Both drugs were ""unlikely to be active against variants from this lineage,"" the fact sheets say. Pushaw acknowledged that omicron is the dominant strain, but said delta variant cases still exist and all monoclonal antibodies have been effective against that strain. ""Even if you decide to take the FDA at their word, without clinical evidence, why would the FDA pull these treatments off the market when we know that decision will harm Delta patients?"" she said. Thomas Unnasch, distinguished health professor at the University of South Florida, said policy needs to adapt to the changing threats of the pandemic.  ""The answer to that eventuality is to admit that the treatment no longer works and to emphasize those things we know work,"" Unnasch said. He noted that this includes getting fully vaccinated. He pointed to five lab studies, including an unedited study published in the open access journal Nature on Dec. 23, 2021, which determined that omicron evaded the antibody treatments. Researchers used scientific technology called ""high-throughput yeast display screening"" to test how well the treatment could neutralize the variant, and found that omicron ""escaped"" the neutralizing antibodies. ""Lab tests against an Omicron ‘pseudovirus’ showed a large reduction in REGEN-COV’s neutralization activity,"" said Regeneron spokesperson Alexandra Bowie. ""This tells us that, unfortunately, it is also not going to be able to neutralize the virus in people infected with this variant."" DeSantis said the FDA was blocking the use of ""lifesaving"" monoclonal antibody drugs ""without a shred of clinical data.""   That wording obscures the full story: There were several scientific studies — including ones from the drugmakers themselves — that found that the drugs from Regeneron and Eli Lilly are ineffective against the omicron variant. Omicron accounts for over 99% of new cases, and this class of drugs only works when given soon after diagnosis. While these drugs helped earlier in the pandemic, they are no longer lifesaving. The agency still allows four other drugs to be used against COVID-19, including another monoclonal antibody treatment called sotromivab, that do work against omicron. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809710C1C0>],/factchecks/2022/jan/31/ron-desantis/fda-drug-companies-say-antibody-treatments-are-not/

Fact-checking Tulsi Gabbard’s misleading claim about monoclonal antibody treatments, delta patients
","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration removed a pair of monoclonal antibody therapies from the list of COVID-19 treatments after they were found to be ineffective against the omicron variant. The federal government notified states Jan. 24 that the medications, made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly, would no longer be distributed.  Some Republican governors, like Florida Gov. Ron Desantis, rebuked the move, claiming that the therapies were ""lifesaving"" and could still help patients with other variants, like delta. Former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, took up a similar position on social media. ""Biden won’t allow Delta-variant COVID patients to get proven and effective monoclonal treatments even though there are 50,000-100,000 Americans infected by Delta EVERY DAY— many of whom will be hospitalized or die without such access,"" Gabbard wrote in a Jan. 26 Facebook post. ""Bottom line is, Biden should stop undermining the health of the American people by interfering with our access to proven therapeutics like monoclonals, and stop your cruel joke of telling us we can take the highly effective therapeutic Paxlovid when you know it isn’t really available."" A spokesperson for Gabbard told us that delta patients will not be able to get monoclonal treatment, like Regeneron, because COVID-19 tests don’t make the distinction whether a person has the delta or omicron variant.  But the therapies were pulled because they are ineffective against omicron, which currently makes up more than 99% of cases in the U.S. The FDA still allows four other drugs that remain effective for both variants, including another monoclonal antibody treatment called sotromivab.  We wanted to check Gabbard’s numbers. Is the delta variant still infecting between 50,000 and 100,000 people per day?  Her team told us she got her estimate from a CNN article that cited data from Dec. 19. It said 95% of cases in the Southern region of the U.S. were omicron. Approximately 700,000 new COVID-19 cases were being reported per day at the time, but Gabbard’s spokesperson said case numbers were likely ""much higher,"" and estimated 1 million per day with 5% being the delta variant and got to at least 50,000 Americans. This is way off the reported numbers and exaggerates outdated data from a portion of the country. RELATED VIDEO Some health systems, including ones in New York City, stopped using the antibody treatments weeks before the FDA’s announcement. The drugmakers Regeneron and Eli Lilly had announced in December that the treatments had ""diminished potency"" against the omicron variant. Several other approved treatments remain effective against both omicron and delta, including sotrovimab, a monoclonal antibody made by GlaxosSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology; paxlovid, an antiviral pill by Pfizer; molnupriavir, an antiviral pill by Merck, and the antiviral drug remdesivir, which is given by infusion. As of now, they are harder to get. A recommendation from the National Institutes of Health said health providers can use the restricted monoclonal treatments if others are unavailable in a region where delta is still prevalent.  ""If we knew we had a delta case, there’s no reason that we couldn't use it,"" said Dr. Marissa Levine, a health professor at the University of South Florida. ""It’s not an all or nothing, it’s just that there really isn’t any delta in the U.S."" FDA spokesperson Chanapa Tantibanchachai told PolitiFact that the NIH panel recommended against the treatments’ use because of ""markedly reduced activity"" against omicron and because real-time testing to identify less-common variants like delta isn’t routinely available. ""CDC data indicate that the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to account for more than 99% of cases in the United States as of Jan. 15,"" Tantibanchachai said. ""Therefore, it’s highly unlikely that COVID-19 patients seeking care in the U.S. at this time are infected with or were exposed to a variant other than omicron."" Some medical providers have complained that some of the other COVID-19 treatments, like Pfizer’s paxlovid pill, are in short supply and proving difficult to get for patients. But multiple medical experts said that they believed the supply tides were turning, and they agreed with the FDA’s pivot. ""Why would you use something that doesn’t work?"" said Dr. Aileen Marty, an infectious disease and disaster medicine specialist at Florida International University. ""You don’t want to give something that causes no benefit, and then there's economic costs, there’s stress to the individual, and with a monoclonal antibody — it’s invasive, and although minor, there’s always a risk of an infection or complications."" Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made molecules that act as substitute antibodies that can mimic the immune system's ability to fight off pathogens such as viruses. The therapy, typically given via IV infusion, has helped eligible patients fend off the virus and avoid hospitalization. These therapies were issued in late 2020 and early 2021 under the FDA’s emergency use authorization, which stipulates that a given treatment’s benefits outweigh any risks it may pose. The use by anyone with COVID-19 was revoked once it was determined that the benefit no longer existed. Monoclonal antibodies can cause stress on the body and, while rare, can cause infections or other side effects like shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting. Medical experts told us that most run-of-the-mill COVID-19 tests cannot differentiate between variants. More sophisticated testing, such as gene sequencing, can give more clear answers. We couldn't find any evidence for Gabbard’s estimate of 50,000 to 100,000 Americans being infected with the delta variant ""every day.""  The current projection is that only 0.1% to 0.2% of sequenced variants in the U.S. are delta, said Cindy Prins, a clinical associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida. If you take the daily average of U.S. COVID-19 cases on Jan. 26 — which was 618,231 — and use the higher end 0.2% delta estimate, then only 1,236 of those cases that day were delta, she added. ""Even though I’m using an estimated percentage for the current proportion of variants that are delta, it’s very reasonable to believe this is accurate because omicron has quickly outcompeted delta to become the dominant variant,"" Prins concluded.  Nicholas Spinelli, a spokesperson at the CDC, also said that national estimates for delta appear to be much lower than Gabbard’s figures. ""SARS-CoV-2 sequencing does not occur for every positive case,"" Spinelli wrote in an email. ""However, based on the surveillance data, in the cases tested the week ending Jan. 22, 0.1 - 0.2% were projected to be delta, and 4,852,998 new cases (were reported) nationally over the same time period. That levels out to approximately 4,853 delta cases for that week, or about 693 per day on average. Case numbers fluctuate, so using figures from another week would result in a different answer."" Others agreed, saying that omicron is, by far, the dominant strain. ""In Florida, we monitor the concentrations of SARS-Cov-2 RNA in wastewater,"" Marty said. ""Back in December, we did have some delta circulating, but the only thing they are finding in the sewers now is omicron."" Gabbard said, ""Biden won’t allow Delta-variant COVID patients to get proven and effective monoclonal treatments even though there are 50,000-100,000 Americans infected by Delta EVERY DAY."" Gabbard’s estimate of daily delta patients appears to be way off, with national surveillance data putting the average estimate closer to 1,000 cases a day. While the Biden administration has limited two monoclonal antibody treatments over their ineffectiveness against omicron,the FDA still allows four other drugs that remain effective for both variants, including another monoclonal antibody treatment called sotromivab.  A person with the delta variant has a harder time now finding treatments for the disease; but the best data show that the number isn’t nearly as high as Gabbard said. Because this claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096749E00>],/factchecks/2022/jan/31/tulsi-gabbard/fact-checking-tulsi-gabbards-misleading-claim-abou/
"['Labor', 'Illinois', 'Lori Lightfoot']","
No, Chicago’s jobless rate in 2021 was not better than “any large American city""
","On New Year’s Eve, Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s office released a 22-page list of her administration’s key achievements in 2021, including a striking claim about Chicago’s jobless rate. ""Chicago maintained the lowest unemployment rate through most of 2021 of any large American city,"" the press release said, listing this fourth among more than 200 ""key accomplishments"" by her administration, ranging from economic development to racial justice reforms. Since the statement seemed to contradict news reports throughout the year suggesting Chicago had among the worst jobless rates in the country — and was a claim Lightfoot repeated several times before — we decided to check. A spokesman in Lightfoot’s office said the mayor’s claim is supported by statistics provided to the administration on jobless rates in the four most populated metropolitan areas — New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston.  In an emailed response, Lightfoot Press Secretary Cesar Rodriguez cited a monthly Economic Recovery Dashboard, published by the city’s economic development arm World Business Chicago (WBC), as the source for the stats. So we called the WBC, where an official said they get their numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics According to the BLS, the jobless rates in the WBC’s dashboard report are identical to the BLS numbers for metropolitan areas, which include suburbs.  The Chicago area’s unemployment rate did drop from 8.7% in January 2021 to 4.5% in November, the most recent month available, a decline that was seen nationwide. In October, Lightfoot launched Accelerate Chicago — a program specifically aimed at tackling the city’s high unemployment rates caused by the COVID-19 crisis, according to Lightfoot’s Oct. 1 news release. At the time, unemployment in the city was at 5.1%. Still, a review of jobless rates in the top four metropolitan areas shows Chicago faring better than New York and Los Angeles, but consistently worse than Houston. Lightfoot made the claim several times throughout 2021, but we could find only one — at a press conference in April — where she specified it pertained to the top four most populated areas in the country. ""We have the lowest unemployment rate among the top four largest U.S. cities,"" she said. ""None of that happened by chance."" In all her other statements we could find on the issue — including the New Year's Eve press release — Lightfoot opted for more broad language suggesting Chicago is doing better than all large cities. ""The numbers that I look at … tell me that Chicago’s got the lowest unemployment rate of any big city in the country,"" Lightfoot said during a May 20 press conference. At another event, on July 22, she used similar language. ""With a historic post-pandemic recovery on the horizon — and folks, we are coming back,"" Lightfoot said during a ribbon cutting for Elm 551 at Parkside. ""Every indicator says that's so both in terms of our numbers of tourism, our hotel occupancy, the fact that events are coming back to this city, our unemployment rate is the lowest of any major city in the country. Lots of great things are happening."" Given that broader language and her repeated use of the phrase ""any"" major city, including in the press release, we reviewed BLS statistics beyond the top four metropolitan areas. With the exception of New York and Los Angeles, Chicago’s jobless rate was worse than any of the other top 15 metro areas. Between January and November 2021, Chicago had an average unemployment rate of 7%, which was higher than 12 of the 15 metropolitan areas. The metro area with the lowest average unemployment rate over the 11-month period is Atlanta at 3.6%. Los Angeles had an average rate of 9%, making it the metropolitan area with the highest average unemployment rate. Houston, with 2.3 million residents, is closest in population to Chicago, which has 2.7 million residents, according to the 2020 U.S. Census. Based on BLS data, Houston had lower unemployment rates compared to Chicago for six of the 11 months from January through November.  Even though Lightfoot’s office relied on BLS jobless rates for the metropolitan areas, which include suburbs, we also checked jobless rates only within the city limits. A comparison of the 10 of the nation’s largest cities shows that half of them — San Jose, Calif., Phoenix, Dallas, San Antonio and Houston — had lower jobless rates than Chicago, based on 11 months of data available through BLS.  When considering only areas within city limits, Houston’s unemployment rate was better than Chicago’s in every available month, January through November. Lightfoot said, ""Chicago maintained the lowest unemployment rate through most of 2021 of any large American city.""  By any statistical measure, the statement is not accurate. Chicago’s unemployment rate in 2021 was consistently worse than other comparable cities, with the exception of only New York and Los Angeles. Even accepting the clarification from Lightfoot’s office that she meant only the four largest cities, it is still wrong. We rate this claim false.",[<zip object at 0x000002809713D2C0>],/factchecks/2022/jan/31/lori-lightfoot/no-chicagos-jobless-rate-2021-was-not-better-any-l/

Study in Brazil on ivermectin as a COVID-19 prevention is flawed, experts say
","Ivermectin is not FDA-approved for use against COVID-19 and there’s no scientific consensus yet of its effectiveness in treating or preventing the virus. But a new study out of Brazil has advocates of the drug again proclaiming the drug’s effectiveness on social media and beyond.  ""Large, peer-reviewed research study proves ivermectin works,"" read the headline of a Jan. 25 article shared widely on Facebook. The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We wanted to know more about whether the study might indeed be a course-changer in the ongoing debate about using ivermectin for COVID-19. But experts in the field criticized the study as having critical flaws involving methodology and incomplete data that detract from what, if anything, it adds to the research. The article was written by a group called the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, also called FLCCC, which described itself as a nonprofit organization of critical care specialists dedicated to developing prevention and treatment protocols for COVID-19. According to the group’s website, it advocates for the use of ivermectin in treating COVID-19. One of the study’s co-authors told PolitiFact that he could not say that the research ""proved"" ivermectin is effective. And he said nothing replaces vaccines. Rather, the manuscript urges ivermectin as an additional tool. Ivermectin tablets and topical forms of the drug are FDA-approved for use in humans to treat parasites and certain skin conditions, but not COVID-19. There are also animal-only formulations of the drug used to treat and prevent heartworms and other parasites.  Asked specifically about this Facebook claim, a spokesperson for the FDA said the agency doesn’t generally comment on third-party research, but evaluates it as part of a body of evidence when forming their guidance. And nothing about its stance has changed. ""Currently, FDA has not authorized or approved ivermectin for use in preventing or treating COVID-19 in humans,"" Chanapa Tantibanchachai, an FDA spokesperson wrote in an email to PolitiFact. ""To date, published clinical trials have shown mixed results."" Tantibanchachai said that while ivermectin can be prescribed by doctors for COVID-19 if they deem it appropriate, ""the safety and efficacy"" hasn’t been established for that use and warned that the drug could negatively interact with other drugs. The World Health Organization also still recommends against using ivermectin to treat COVID-19 outside of clinical trials. A WHO spokesperson said the organization is following the research on ivermectin. ""As of today, there is no plan to review our guidelines on ivermectin in the immediate future, but that could change,"" the spokesperson said. The FLCCC story shared on Facebook links to a study published on Jan. 15 in the scientific journal Cureus. Its authors, two of whom are members of the FLCCC, concluded that ""regular use of ivermectin as a prophylactic agent was associated with significantly reduced COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality rates,"" based on an observational study of 159,561 residents ages 18 and over in Itajaí, Brazil. According to the study, between July 7, 2020, and Dec. 2, 2020, 113,845 participants of a citywide program took the drug, while 45,716 did not. Those who took ivermectin caught COVID-19 at a rate of 3.7%, while those who did not had a 6.6% infection rate. After adjusting for variables, the authors said, they found a 67% reduction in hospitalization rate and a 70% reduction in mortality rate for ivermectin users. It sounds promising, but two experts not associated with the study pointed out serious research flaws, including leaving questions about whether those identified as having taken the ivermectin actually did as prescribed. They also raised questions about conflict of interest by some of its authors. Dr. Nikolas Wada, an epidemiologist with the Novel Coronavirus Research Compendium at Johns Hopkins, raised concerns about the study's uncertainty over who was ""truly taking ivermectin and vice versa"" and poor control for factors that may predispose someone to catch COVID-19, among other issues. ""My primary takeaway,"" Wada said, ""is that this paper adds nearly nothing to the knowledge base regarding ivermectin and COVID-19, and certainly does not prove its effectiveness as a prophylaxis."" Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist and Ph.D student from the University of Wollongong in Australia who often writes about COVID-19, said the research lacks critical information about the study’s participants, including how many Itajaí residents were already taking ivermectin before the program began and how many continued to take the full doses of the drug as prescribed. ""This sort of epidemiological study is very prone to biases resulting from characteristics that are inherently different between the intervention and control groups,"" Meyerowitz-Katz said. ""There is essentially no information on how many people in either the intervention or control group actually took ivermectin, which is a fairly important consideration if that's what the authors were trying to investigate."" Meyerowitz-Katz detailed some of his concerns about the study in a long Twitter thread in December, when the study was in preprint, a draft version that has not been peer-reviewed.  He said not much has changed in the published version. The Municipal Health Department of Itajaí said in January of 2021 — a year before the study was published — that 138,216 residents took the first dose of ivermectin when it started distributing the drug as part of a citywide program. That number fell to 93,970 people taking the second and third doses, and 8,312 taking the fourth and fifth doses, the department said. The study’s authors acknowledged the uncertainty about the drug regimen in the ""discussion"" section of the publication. Dr. Flavio Cadegiani, corresponding author of the study, also addressed it in an email to PolitiFact, arguing the results would be even better in a controlled study if all users had taken the drug regularly. But Cadegiani defended the study’s methodology. ""Limitations of the study are those inherent to any populational, observational studies,"" said Cadegiani, who said they used a method called propensity score matching ""to increase the level of certainty of the findings."" Cadegiani said that in addition to showing positive results for ivermectin, the study explicitly states that ""nothing replaces the vaccines."" Dr. Lucy Kerr, the study’s lead author, responded to criticism in the comment section below the study, writing that the data was complete and that ""the most relevant clinical variables that affected mortality from COVID-19 were considered. She said that the study was ""strong, robust, precise"" and ""very high quality."" We reached out to Kerr via email but didn’t hear back. As for whether the headline of the article’s assertion that the study ""proves"" that ivermectin works, even Cadegiani isn’t so sure, despite being a member of the FLCCC, the group promoting the study. ""Our work was to check whether in that population ivermectin would be effective or not, in terms of protection from COVID-19 infection, hospitalizations, or deaths. At least from what we received, it seemed to work. And I was not a believer at all,"" he told PolitiFact. ""Now, the concept of being 'proven' is scientifically hard to tell — even a precise definition lacks,"" he said. ""I have never said it was proven anywhere. How people interpret and claim, that is not under my control."" Wada and Meyerowitz-Katz, who were not involved with the study, each pointed out potential conflicts of interest with the study’s authors. They noted that although the preprint version of the study mentions that two of its authors received money from a pharmaceutical company that manufactures ivermectin, the published version leaves that detail out. The preprint study said that Kerr received funding from Vitamedic ""unrelated to this study"" and that Cadegiani was paid for consulting services by the firm, also unrelated to the study, and that he donated it all for COVID-19 patient care and research. In an email to PolitiFact, Cadegiani also said he did not have any conflicts and reiterated that he had donated his payment. The published version of the study simply stated that ""all authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work."" The National Research Ethics Commission in Brazil, meanwhile, is investigating another clinical trial of an experimental COVID-19 drug in which Cadegiani was the lead author for possible violation of ethics, according to The BMJ and the publication Science. An article shared on Facebook about an ivermectin study out of Brazil states that the ""large, peer-reviewed research study proves ivermectin works."" The article is being promoted by the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, a group that promotes the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19. Two of the study’s authors are members of the group. The study, one of its authors said, does not definitively prove that ivermectin works as a prevention or treatment for COVID-19. Experts not involved in the study pointed out serious flaws in the study and conflicts of interest with its authors. The FDA and WHO have not changed their positions on the use of ivermectin outside of clinical trials.

Nothing happening here, nothing to see. This is a travesty, this is a scandal.""  That was a real jaw-dropper for us. All sorts of athletes dropping dead on the field because of the vaccine?  Is Johnson right? No. Let’s take a closer look. When asked for backup for the claim, Johnson spokeswoman Vanessa Ambrosini told us the senator has been alarmed by stories he has heard of athletes dying on the field.  ""The Senator’s point in raising these issues,"" she said via email, ""has always been that our federal health agencies should be concerned about reports on adverse reactions related to COVID-19 vaccines and they should fully investigate and make their findings available to the American people."" Fair enough. But the claim was that there are stories about all sorts of athletes dying in the midst of competition, or at least while practicing. Patrick Remington, director of the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s preventive medicine residency program and a former epidemiologist for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency is already monitoring such things. Johnson frequently cites a federal database of adverse events that people – from patients to doctors – report to the agency as possibly connected to various drugs. But the database itself notes the claims are not vetted to establish a cause between them. Remington said the CDC is looking for causation, not just coincidence of two events happening in proximity to each other, such as cardiac episode and getting a vaccine.  ""The burden is on credible scientists to study whether vaccination could be associated with this outcome, and no credible science exists to say it is,"" he said. ""We continue to do ongoing surveillance, the vaccine surveillance system is in place to study any possible associations that come up. But to date, I am not aware of any studies or any credible research that suggests that vaccines cause death in young athletes.""  Ambrosini also shared an article from goodsciencing.com which purports to list hundreds of young athletes who have died from the vaccine. The article was previously debunked in a  Dec. 17, 2021 fact-check by FactCheck.org. ""We found no proof of a causal relationship in any of the cases between the vaccines and the injuries or deaths,"" the fact-check said.  Johnson’s team also cited a Dec. 23, 2021 article from the Daily Mail, which suggested that the heart problems of two Premier League soccer players – who did not die – were related to the COVID vaccine.  But those claims have also been debunked. A June 2021 fact check by Reuters found that  Christian Ericksen’s collapse during a game was not a result of a vaccine. At the time of the collapse, Erickson was not vaccinated and was not sick with COVID.  As for Sergio Aguero, the other soccer player, his cardiologist said the cardiac episode the player experienced was likely caused by a small scar on his heart, according to a Dec. 17, 2021 article in the Irish Post. The scar, he said, was likely caused by another virus at some point in the player’s life, but was in no way related to COVID or the vaccine.  In addition, other fact-checks have looked at similar claims.  Days before Johnson took to the Charlie Kirk Show, former NBA All-Star John Stockton on Jan. 23 2022 claimed more than 100 professional athletes who were vaccinated have dropped dead ""right on the pitch, right on the field, right on the court.""  PolitiFact National rated this False in a Jan. 26, 2022 fact-check. In it, Matthew Martinez, a sports cardiologist with the National Football League, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League and Major League Soccer and who is director of sports cardiology at Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey said he was not aware of a single COVID vaccine-related cardiac complication in professional sports.  Other doctors made similar statements. The item went on to explain that a rare risk of myocarditis appears to be higher following a COVID-19 infection, citing a study that found that boys and young men infected with the virus are up to six times more likely to develop the heart condition than those who have received the vaccine. In other words, being vaccinated reduces this risk.  The CDC says that it has not detected unusual or unexpected patterns for deaths following immunizations that would indicate vaccines are causing or contributing to deaths, outside of nine confirmed deaths following the Janssen vaccine from Johnson & Johnson. Those deaths resulted from a rare and serious adverse reaction involving blood clots, called thrombosis.  But that is far from hundreds, and is far different than Johnson’s claim of ""all these athletes"" dying on the playing field. Johnson claimed that ""all these athletes are dropping dead on the field"" after receiving the COVID-19 vaccination.  But similar claims have repeatedly been debunked – doctors have not encountered athletes dropping dead from the vaccine. And doctors for the two European soccer players Johnson’s staff cited have said those cardiac episodes were not caused by the vaccine. There is also the obvious problem with those cases, as they relate to supporting Johnson’s claim, so far as that the two athletes are not, well, dead. Finally, health experts have also said that no research shows the link between sudden death incidents in sports players and vaccines.  We rate this claim as False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280F67D8380>],/factchecks/2022/jan/28/ron-johnson/johnson-wrong-claim-covid-vaccines-are-killing-ath/

Joe Biden isn’t first to prioritize race, gender in picking SCOTUS nominee, as Sean Hannity claimed
","Fox News host Sean Hannity misleadingly claimed that President Joe Biden was venturing into unprecedented territory with his pledge to nominate a Black woman as a replacement for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, who is retiring after 28 years. ""I'm saying this fully acknowledging that there are definitely qualified people in all backgrounds, all races, all religions, etc., etc.,"" Hannity said Jan. 27 during a conversation on his radio show. ""But there's never been a president that has made race and gender the defining factor. That's the difference here."" Biden, who promised during his campaign to nominate the first Black woman to the nation’s highest court, said he plans to settle on a nominee before the end of February. Only two Black men, the late Justice Thurgood Marshall and Justice Clarence Thomas, and only one woman of color, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is Hispanic, have ever served on the Supreme Court. But Hannity’s claim that Biden did what’s never been done before when he announced his intent to fill Breyer’s seat with a Black woman — a move some conservatives have cast as affirmative action — runs counter to the long history of Supreme Court nominations.  A spokesperson for Hannity’s radio program did not respond to a request for comment. Less than two years ago, President Donald Trump vowed to nominate a woman to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He then appointed Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the vacancy.  President Donald Trump watches as Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas administers the Constitutional Oath to Amy Coney Barrett on Oct. 26, 2020. (AP) ""I will be putting forth a nominee next week. It will be a woman,"" Trump said Sept. 19, 2020, during a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina. He later added: ""It will be a woman, a very talented, very brilliant woman. I haven’t chosen yet, but we have numerous women on the list."" Decades earlier, President Ronald Reagan said that if he were elected, he would nominate the first woman to the Supreme Court. ""It is time for a woman to sit among our highest jurists,"" he said at a news conference weeks before the 1980 election, according to the Washington Post. A year later, Reagan followed through, nominating Justice Sandra Day O’Connor.  President Ronald Reagan presents his Supreme Court nominee Sandra Day O'Connor to members of the press in the White House Rose Garden on July 15, 1981. (AP) Race, and also religion, played a role in other Supreme Court nominations, as well.  Nikolas Bowie, assistant professor of law at Harvard Law School, said Hannity’s claim ""ignores the reality that from 1789 through 1967, every president made race and gender a defining factor in their selection process by refusing to nominate anyone other than a white man."" Tomiko Brown-Nagin, another professor of constitutional law and history at Harvard University, said the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s Italian background was a ""defining, positive factor in Ronald Reagan’s selection of him,"" citing a report in Slate, a progressive online magazine. In a 2003 interview with the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, Peter Wallison, Reagan’s White House counsel at the time of Scalia’s appointment in 1986, said that Reagan ""wanted to be sure that he could appoint the first Italian-American … he felt that it would be great to put an Italian-American on the Supreme Court."" ""Reagan had asked me whether Scalia was of Italian extraction,"" Wallison said, according to the Miller Center’s interview transcript. ""I think he used the word ‘extraction,’ and I said, ‘Yes, he’s of Italian extraction.’ Reagan said, ‘That’s the man I want to nominate, so I want to meet him.’""  President Ronald Reagan speaks at a news briefing at the White House in Washington, where he announced the nomination of Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court on June 17, 1986. (AP) In 1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower told his attorney general, ""I still want the name of some fine, prominent Catholic to nominate to the bench,"" according to books by historian David A. Nichols, a former professor at Southwestern College, and Sheldon Goldman, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The late Justice William Brennan Jr., the Catholic whom Eisenhower appointed in 1956, acknowledged this during an interview with Irish America magazine. ""I have seen the record that President Eisenhower, when this vacancy arose, gave instructions to the Attorney General that he would like consideration of a Catholic,"" Brennan said.  President Dwight D. Eisenhower shakes the hand of Justice William J. Brennan Jr. in the White House on Sept. 29, 1956, after selecting Brennan to the U.S. Supreme Court. (AP) Contemporary reporting also indicated that President George H. W. Bush concentrated the search that ended with Thomas’ swearing-in in 1991 mostly on minority and female candidates, though Bush denied that he was trying to satisfy a ""quota"" by replacing one Black justice with another. Thomas replaced Marshall, a former civil rights attorney and the court’s first Black justice, who retired due to health issues.  Hannity said that before Biden’s recent pledge to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court, ""there's never been a president that has made race and gender the defining factor."" The claim ignored that both Trump and Reagan made similar vows to nominate women to the Supreme Court, then followed through on those promises. Other presidents in history have also considered race and religion as they have made their picks. We rate Hannity’s claim False.

Biden did not receive millions from the drug industry as a member of Congress
","Throughout his political career, President Joe Biden has received campaign contributions from the pharmaceutical industry.

This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Among people who have served in Congress, Biden holds a record for drug industry contributions. But the record is not for the money received when he was in Congress, as the post says. Biden has received more than $8.8 million from political action committees and individuals within the pharmaceutical and health products industry, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan nonprofit tracking money in politics. OpenSecrets’ website lists him as the top all-time recipient of pharmaceutical industry money among people who served in Congress. But less than 1% of Biden’s total came during his 36-year tenure in Congress. The rest came during his campaign for president in 2020. The next three highest recipients among people who have served in Congress were also candidates for president as their party’s nominees: Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney, now a Utah senator. Between 1989 and 2008, the pharmaceutical industry gave Biden’s Senate campaign committees $69,100, ranking him 708th among members of Congress, said Doug Weber, senior researcher for OpenSecrets. The list doesn’t include Donald Trump, who never served in Congress. In his 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, Trump collected just over $3.2 million from the pharmaceutical industry. Excluding presidential candidates, Utah Republican Orrin Hatch, who retired in 2019 after 42 years in the Senate, holds the record for the highest pharmaceutical industry contributions to a member of Congress: $2,681,843.  The highest-ranking Democrat on the list is Rep. Anna Eshoo of California, who has received $2,007,631 from the industry since she took office in 1993, according to OpenSecrets.

Looking at how many trucks are participating in the “Freedom Convoy” in Canada
","A so-called ""Freedom Convoy"" of Canadian truckers protesting the government’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for drivers who cross the border has drawn international attention and sweeping claims about the number of big rigs involved.  They were expected to start arriving in Ottawa on Jan. 28 — but how many trucks are on track to converge at the country’s capital? Some Facebook posts are claiming there were 50,000 and as many as 250,000. But we haven’t found evidence to support that.  These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As trucks were reported to pass through Toronto on Jan. 27, we called the police department there and spoke with Constable Edward Parks, who laughed when we floated the 50,000 figure but said ""at this point, no one knows how many trucks there are.""  There were about 20 to 30 in the Toronto area, he said, and reports of more across the province of Ontario, where the city is the capital.  The Royal Canadian Mounted Police told us they didn’t know how big the convoy was and suggested we contact the convoy’s organizers. We tried but were unsuccessful.  Benjamin Dichter, a spokesman for the convoy, told the Toronto Sun that the convoy from British Columbia to Ottawa was 70 kilometers long.  ""There are estimates the Canadian convoy could compromise 50,000 trucks from West, East, and even from the United States,"" the Sun reported, with a caveat. ""It’s difficult to speculate what will translate in the days ahead.""  A press release that listed Dichter as a contact was posted on Jan. 26 in the Facebook group Freedom Convoy 2022. It said that ""although our initial convoy (is) estimated to be 1,600 trucks, that number significantly increased to 36,000 trucks in just a few days. It is now estimated that the number of heavy trucks heading to Ottawa is closer to 50,000."" But cobbling together estimates from authorities and news reports so far, we haven’t reached anywhere near 50,000 trucks, much less 250,000. On Jan. 23, the CBC reported that ""hundreds"" of truckers were bound for Ottawa.  On Jan. 24, the Regina Leader-Post reported that ""based on organizers’ estimates,"" about 1,200 trucks were expected to pass through the Saskatchewan city that day. When truckers passed through Winnipeg the next day, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told CTV News Winnipeg that the convoy was 20 kilometers long (our back-of-the-envelope math shows that would be about 820 trucks bumper-to-bumper, though news reports have said that cars and tractors without trailers are mixed in).  On Jan. 27, Adrian Ghobrial of Toronto’s City News tweeted that while there were thousands of cars and SUVs at an outlet mall in the city that day, ""you’d be hard pressed to find 100 trucks.""  David Akin, chief political correspondent for Global News, tweeted that the Ontario Provincial Police said that the convoy that arrived in Winnipeg from Thunder Bay that day included 113 trucks. On Jan. 28, Akin followed up with information from ""several police sources."" There are eight separate convoy captains, he tweeted, and 230 trucks from Toronto and Western Canada. That tweet inspired CNN’s Daniel Dale to urge people to please not believe ""the wildly nonsensical ‘TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TRUCKS!!!’ claims circulating on social media and in right-wing media."" By the Kingston police office’s count, there 17 tractors trailers and 103 tractors with no trailers.  The estimates of 50,000 and 250,000 truckers in the Freedom Convoy also far exceed the number of drivers trucking groups say will lose work because they won’t get vaccinated.  The CBC reported that both the Canadian Trucking Alliance and the American Trucking Associations say that up to 26,000 of 160,000 drivers who regularly cross the U.S.-Canada border are likely to be sidelined due to the vaccine mandate.   In Canada alone, as many as 16,000 drivers may be sidelined, according to the Canadian Trucking Alliance. Omar Alghabra, the Canadian transport minister, said about 90% of truckers there are vaccinated.  We couldn’t find any evidence to support the claim that 250,000 trucks are participating in the convoy — five time greater than even the organizers’ estimates.  We rate this post False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809695EAC0>],/factchecks/2022/jan/28/viral-image/looking-how-many-trucks-are-participating-freedom-/

Deceptive RNC edit takes Biden’s words on taking Supreme Court questions out of context
","The Republican National Committee posted a selectively edited video of President Joe Biden to give the misleading impression that Biden said taking questions from reporters is inappropriate. ""BIDEN: 'I'm not gonna take any questions because I think it's inappropriate,'"" said the Jan. 27 tweet from the RNC Research account, which received a few hundred retweets and likes.  The tweet showed a 3-second clip from Biden’s event honoring the retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, a Clinton administration appointee who spent 28 years on the bench.  But the video and tweet took Biden’s comments out of context and cut him off mid-sentence. What’s left is an abbreviated, misleading quote that doesn’t accurately capture what Biden said. The president’s full remarks, as seen on video and in the White House’s official transcript, show that he was not speaking about taking questions in absolute terms.  Biden reiterated his commitment to nominate a Black woman as Breyer’s replacement during his speech. Then, after Breyer spoke, Biden wrapped up the event and said that it would be inappropriate to take questions in front of Breyer, since the justice is ""still sitting on the bench."" Biden went on to say that there would soon be other opportunities for reporters to ask him questions.   Here’s what Biden said to close the Jan. 27 event, with the comment the RNC plucked out in its deceptive tweet highlighted in bold for emphasis: ""That you all so very, very much for being here. And I’m not going to take any questions because I think it’s inappropriate to take questions with the justice here. He’s still sitting on the bench and — I’ll give you your mask back — and, but you’ll have plenty of opportunities to get me later today and for the rest of the week, and next week too. So thank you very much. Thank you."" The Associated Press reported on Jan. 9 that Biden held fewer news conferences and participated in fewer media interviews during his first year in office than his recent predecessors had — although the outlet also reported that Biden more frequently fielded questions during his public appearances than those same predecessors, citing research from a Towson University professor. But Biden did not say Jan. 27 that he thinks taking questions in general is inappropriate. The RNC tweet abbreviated Biden’s remarks to leave that misleading impression. The tweet contained an element of truth — the words it highlighted did indeed come out of Biden’s mouth — but its editing and presentation omitted what Biden said next, critical information that would give a different impression.  We rate the tweet Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978318C0>],/factchecks/2022/jan/28/republican-national-committee-republican/deceptive-rnc-edit-takes-bidens-words-taking-supre/

Finkenauer says, ""Well heck, I don’t even know what’s in it at this point, they keep going back and forth. I will say, look, I am not for giving tax breaks to folks in California or New York, but I am for making sure that 3- and 4-year-olds have universal preschool in this country."" She also said she supports the plan expanding universal, publicly-funded pre-K education but not expanding state and local (SALT) tax deductions.  Finkenauer is seeking the Democratic nomination to run against Sen.

O’Rourke’s claim about Texas fourth-graders’ reading proficiency supported by sample federal data
","Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke has made improving education one of his campaign priorities. He wants to expand full-day pre-K, increase per-pupil spending, keep teachers in the workforce and reduce Texas' emphasis on standardized testing. In place of that emphasis, the campaign's director of policy and research Gina Hinojosa wrote, Texas could develop strategies ""that better allow teachers to teach to the student, not to a standardized test."" At a November rally, O'Rourke released a startling statistic while speaking about increasing teacher pay. ""Right now, in the average Texas fourth grade classroom, seven out of 10 kids cannot read at grade level,"" O'Rourke said. That would mean most fourth grade students in Texas are reading below grade level. We took a look at this claim. O'Rourke's campaign pointed to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, which falls under the U.S. Department of Education and the Institute of Education Sciences. The center tracks the performance of U.S. students through the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The results are presented in The Nation's Report Card. The assessment is the longest running assessment nationally that gauges students' knowledge and skills. The assessment is administered to a sample of students nationally.  Students, teachers, and administrators also complete survey questionnaires for contextual information on students' classroom experiences.  The most recent data is from 2019. The 2019 reading assessment was given to approximately 150,600 Grade 4 students nationally, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress website. For Texas, 7,400 fourth grade students participated in mathematics and 7,400 Texas fourth grade students participated in reading. The 2019 data indicates 30% of fourth-graders in Texas are at or above the ""proficient"" level, meaning 70% are below that level. For context, the Texas fourth-grade reading data are similar to the national rate: 34% of fourth-graders nationally read at or above the proficient level in 2019. ""Proficient"" means students can interpret texts and apply their understanding of the text. It ""represents the goal for what all students should know,"" according to the governing board for the national assessment. The national assessment has three ranges in its scoring system: basic, proficient, and advanced. Scoring basic on the assessment means students can make simple inferences and understand the main idea of a text, and 61% of Texas fourth-grade students scored at or above basic in reading. Overall, that 30% would seem to match O'Rourke's numbers. However, how the federal government defines ""proficient"" does not mean that's how Texas education officials define it. Grady Wilburn, a statistician for the National Center for Education Statistics, noted in an email that states have their own definition on what it means to read at grade level. The National Assessment of Educational Progress conducted an analysis in 2019 on how the proficiency criteria used by states compares to the national assessment, Catherine Lammert, assistant professor of reading methods at Texas Tech University's Teacher Education Department, wrote in a Jan. 5 email. ""Texas was listed as one of the states where grade-level proficiency standards exceeded the 'basic' standards of NAEP but does not surpass the 'proficient' level,"" Lammert wrote. In 2019, most states' definitions of ""proficient"" actually fall within the ""basic"" category of the national assessment. Only four states — Illinois, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Oklahoma — had standards on par with the national proficient level. Virginia's standards were below the basic level. In Texas, a student could simultaneously read at grade level by the state's definition and not be proficient by the national definition. ""Every state has their own curricular standards, and every state uses assessments aligned to those standards,"" Lammert wrote. ""NAEP has been used for decades as a tool to compare rates of reading achievement across states. This is valuable. Since each state defines proficiency differently, by nature NAEP is a harder measure than some states’ assessments and an easier measure than others."" The results of the 2021 State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, the Texas standardized tests, indicate 36% of Texas fourth grade students scored at or above grade level for reading. The percentage of fourth-grade students reading at or above grade level declined from 2019 to 2021. In 2019, 43% of students were reading at or above grade level. Lammert cautioned that statewide averages can hide that some classrooms face steeper challenges and inequalities in funding, access and support compared to others. Virtually all students in better-resourced, higher-income communities may read at grade level. Lammert gave an example: at Casis Elementary School in the affluent Tarrytown neighborhood of West Austin, 97% of the students passed the STAAR reading exam, but in East Austin at Oak Springs, the average was 59%. ""In Texas, ZIP code determines opportunity,"" Lammert wrote. In a series of criticisms against Gov. Greg Abbott, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke said, ""Right now, in the average Texas fourth grade classroom, 7 out of 10 kids cannot read at grade level.""   This matches data from the national assessment standard for proficient, as defined by the National Center for Education Statistics. To get a different view, it's important to note that Texas has its own definition of reading at grade level. Texas, alongside many other states, has lower standards than the national assessment. But the state's own assessment results indicate 64% of fourth grade students did not meet grade level for reading in 2021, not far off from the national data. We rate this claim Mostly True, meaning the statement is accurate but needs additional information or context.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097802240>],/factchecks/2022/jan/28/beto-orourke/three-out-10-texas-fourth-graders-read-or-above-pr/

Ron Johnson: Iran's parliament gets to vote on nuclear deal, Congress should too
","Republican Sen. Ron Johnson wants President Barack Obama to seek Congress’ approval before finalizing a deal with Iran, an agreement that would halt the country’s nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanction relief. Obama has argued that since the agreement is not a treaty, Congress’ approval isn’t needed. But Johnson, R-Wis., one of 47 GOP senators who signed a controversial letter to Iran critical of the negotiations, isn’t buying it. ""The Iranian parliament will get to say yes or no on this deal,"" Johnson said March 8, ""and I think the United States Congress should have the exact same input into the process."" It’s a curious comparison, but is it accurate? We decided to check. You can look at this through two lenses: What does Iran’s Constitution literally say about the duties of the parliament, called the Islamic Consultative Assembly or the Majles? And in practice, what responsibilities does the parliament actually have in an authoritarian regime heavily controlled by the Supreme Leader and the unelected 12-member Guardian Council? The Iran Constitution The Iranian parliament is made up of 290 elected officials. Their duties are outlined in the country’s Constitution. There are some strict limitations on the body’s power. For example, it ""cannot enact laws contrary to the usual and ahkam (the Islamic commandments) of the official religion of the country or to the Constitution."" The Guardian Council determines if a law is in violation and it often overturns legislation in the name of Islam or the constitution. But the Constitution does bestow some broad powers on the assembly. Article 77 says, ""International treaties, protocols, contracts, and agreements must be approved by the Islamic Consultative Assembly."" That would seem to be a point for Johnson, right? Not necessarily. Just as the White House contends that the agreement is not a treaty and therefore not subject to congressional approval, Obama’s National Security Council says the deal would not fall under ""international treaties, protocols, contracts and agreements"" in the Iranian Constitution. Experts agreed. ""The Iranian parliament has the authority to ratify treaties, but a possible nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1 will be a political agreement, not a treaty,"" said Alireza Nader, a senior policy analyst at RAND Corporation. ""The Majles can debate the agreement, but it is unlikely to vote yes or no on it. The political establishment, including the Supreme Leader, president, etc., will have the critical voice."" There is one aspect of the agreement that may need approval from Iran’s parliament. The Joint Plan of Action for reaching an agreement says that the final step to a comprehensive solution is contingent on Iran ratifying and implementing the ""additional protocol."" What’s that? Under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which Iran signed, member countries must abide to standards set forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In 2003, the agency approved additional protocols for Iran so the agency could monitor Iran’s nuclear sites. While Iran temporarily abided by the additional protocol, it has since stopped, and it never ratified the agreement. If Iran wants the United States to lift its economic sanctions, it must ratify that agreement, which would require action by Iran’s parliament. A 'dead letter'? Johnson’s staff pointed us to a report on Iran’s parliament from the United States Institute of Peace. It noted that the Islamic Consultative Assembly has ""forced a degree of accountability on the executive branch through its powers over the budget, confirmation or impeachment of ministers, and interpellation,"" and that ""has long served as the one public outlet for political differences."" ""By Middle East standards, the persistence and vitality of Iran’s Majles has been somewhat remarkable,"" the report said, especially as a vehicle for local cultural and economic debate. But the same report also noted how toothless the body is, particularly on foreign policy. Every candidate that runs for parliament is vetted by the Guardian Council. As it is, turnover is constant, and dissenters don’t last long. And unelected leaders often get around the body’s legislative role or strong arm the assembly, particularly on nuclear issues, the report said. Put bluntly, any power the Constitution grants the parliament is a ""dead letter,"" said Matthew Kroenig, co-author of The Handbook of National Legislatures: A Global Survey. ""It is inconceivable that the Iranian parliament would stand in the way of an agreement that had the support of the government and the Supreme Leader,"" said Kroenig, professor of international relations at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. Johnson’s office noted that already Iran’s parliament voted on the nuclear negotiations. That came on Jan. 6, when the Islamic Consultative Assembly held a vote on the government’s handling of the nuclear negotiations. But the assembly ultimately sided with the regime and the vote had no repercussions tied to it anyway. The parliament is under ""heavy influence of the Supreme Leader, and in recent years has not acted against his interests,"" Nader said. Our ruling Johnson said, ""The Iranian parliament will get to say yes or no"" on the nuclear deal. This is incorrect on two accounts. Experts said the nuclear agreement between the United States and Iran won’t require ratification by Iran’s parliament, the Islamic Consultative Assembly. It’s possible the deal will be contingent on Iran’s ratification of a previous international nuclear agreement, which might require the assembly’s approval, but the body won’t weigh in on the deal currently being worked on. And even if it did, it would be entirely symbolic, as the assembly is heavily influenced by the Supreme Leader on foreign policy matters.

Democratic Party says Scott Walker proposed selling state parks
","Many aspects of Gov. Scott Walker’s 2015-’17 budget have come under heavy criticism, but this headline on a state Democratic Party news release really caught our attention: ""Scott Walker's Iowa Caucus Budget Would Sell Off Wisconsin's State Parks."" The Iowa part didn’t surprise us -- it’s just the party’s latest dig at Walker for spending more time out of state as he weighs a potential 2016 presidential bid. That includes Iowa, home to the first voting in that contest. But would Walker’s budget ""sell off Wisconsin’s state parks""? As in, to private bidders? No. It wouldn’t. When we asked Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff for evidence to support the claim, it became evident that there was some false advertising in the news release. ""We are referring to the proposals by Walker administration officials at the DNR to sell off naming rights to the state parks to offset his budget cuts to the state park system,"" Baldauff wrote in an email, adding ""the people who do live here aren't likely to want to see our richest natural resources sold off to corporations and campaign donors."" OK. But selling naming rights is far, far different than selling any of Wisconsin’s 64 state parks, forests and recreational areas. And even that is not in the budget itself. Rather, naming rights is an idea that came up in questioning during a March 3, 2015, hearing of the Joint Finance Committee. Under Walker’s budget, state parks would have to sustain themselves through higher admission and camping fees. That stirred questions from lawmakers when Department of Natural Resources Secretary Cathy Stepp, a Walker appointee, testified. State Sen. Jon Erpenbach, D-Middleton, quizzed Stepp about her plans for keeping the state parks in business. A video of the meeting shows that Stepp said there was sufficient money to run the parks for the next two years, and said officials would use the time to consider ways to best fund parks beyond that. Said Stepp:  ""We also are going to be engaged in conversations with external partners and opportunities for us to be able to leverage -- I guess for lack of a better word -- more support within our state parks."" The senator asked whether that meant Stepp was considering selling state parks. ""Well, we’re not talking about that,"" Stepp responded. Despite her answer, Erpenbach pressed on and asked if sale of parks had been discussed within the agency. ""We have not discussed that at this point...it’s very premature. I don’t anticipate that’s going to be a problem,"" she said. ""We’re talking about engaging with external partners for opportunities for, say, concessions, sponsorships, while still maintaining the integrity and the unique state park experience for our users."" Stepp declined Erpenbach’s invitation to say what the state might be willing to accept for, say, a sponsorship of Devil’s Lake, the most-visited state park. When we reached out to the department, assistant deputy secretary Michael Bruhn said in an email that Stepp was drawn into the selling of parks discussion by the questions. ""Cathy’s testimony did NOT say anything about selling state parks. Senator Erpenbach made the claim,"" he wrote. ""We are NOT considering selling state parks."" Our rating The state Democratic Party of Wisconsin said Walker’s budget ""would sell off Wisconsin’s state parks."" But that is not included in the budget, and Stepp said during testimony it was not under consideration. At best, what is up for discussion is the potential sale of naming rights as a way to derive extra revenue for the parks.

Scarborough: Clinton told State Department staff not to use personal email for official business
","The furor over Hillary Clinton’s emails during her time as secretary of state has only grown since the New York Times reported she used a personal account for official business. At a press conference at the United Nations March 10, 2015, Clinton said she wished she had handled her email differently but that she complied with federal rules. Clinton’s office has turned over more than 55,000 pages of emails and documents to the State Department for review and ultimately some type of public release. Meanwhile, details on those government rules concerning email continue to emerge. Joe Scarborough latched on to one recent disclosure -- a 2011 State Department memo that went out under Clinton’s name. ""She sent out a memo that says ... you should not do State Department business on personal email,"" Scarborough said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on March, 9, 2015. ""She sent that memo out to every employee at the State Department."" For this fact-check, we wanted to dig into the details of Scarborough’s claim that Clinton sent this sort of memo across the entire department. Scarborough’s staff sent us links to several articles. Fox News posted the actual memo dated June 28, 2011. It was sent to diplomatic and consular staff worldwide in response to a warning from Google that hackers had targeted the Gmail addresses of government workers. It began with ""Department of State users are encouraged to check the security settings and change passwords on their home email accounts because of recent targeting of personal email accounts by online adversaries."" Under the heading ""What can you and your family members do?"" the memo covered such familiar steps as changing your password and making sure you choose a strong one. It also said, ""Avoid conducting official Department business from your personal email accounts."" This memo had a bit of history. In 2005, a department manual covered transmitting information that is ""sensitive but unclassified."" That is a broad category that covers anything from meeting schedules, to visa applications, to ordinary emails to other federal agencies. The manual basically said that department-related email should go through servers authorized by the department. As a point of reference, we don’t know if the State Department had signed off on the private server that carried Clinton’s emails (she didn’t use Gmail or Yahoo! or another commercial provider) or if the server met government security standards. Caveats to Scarborough’s claim Scarborough twice said Clinton sent the memo, which ascribes a more personal touch than was actually the case. In the strictest literal sense, Clinton neither wrote nor sent the memo in question. In a March 6 briefing, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said this was a routine memo, or cable. ""Her name is at the bottom of the cable, as is practice for cables coming from Washington,"" Harf said. ""Some people think she wrote it -- which is not accurate."" Steven Aftergood directs the project on government secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists, a group that promotes transparency in government. ""It seems unlikely that the secretary of state would have written or even seen this kind of housekeeping memo,"" Aftergood told PunditFact. ""Still, it went out over her name and she is in some sense responsible for it,"" he said. Scarborough also summarized the memo as saying ""you should not do State Department business on personal email."" That is a bit off target. There’s a difference between a guideline and a requirement. The memo itself makes the distinction, Aftergood said. In the list of things staffers can do, the final point used stronger language. It said, ""Do not auto-forward department email to personal email accounts, which is prohibited by department policy."" ""It's interesting that the memo says that employees should ‘avoid’ conducting official business via personal email, but it says that auto-forwarding department email to a private account is ‘prohibited’,"" Aftergood said. ""The clear implication is that use of personal email for conducting official business is discouraged, but not strictly prohibited."" In that light, Scarborough's term ""should"" goes a little further than the memo. Security vs. retaining records Clinton was secretary of state before there was a law that would have required her to use a government email address or share copies of her communications with the government. That came in 2014. Two significant topics remain unresolved. First, it would make a difference if any of her emails contain classified information. We don’t know if they do. Second, there is a long-standing state department policy on using email for sensitive but unclassified information. That policy speaks to the need to send email through a server that meets department standards. At her U.N. press conference, Clinton said the server she used was set up for former President Bill Clinton’s office and that it had ""numerous safeguards."" That said, we don’t know the security protections in place on that server. Our ruling Scarborough said that Clinton sent a memo to State Department staff that said they should not use personal email accounts for department business. Scarborough pushed a bit too far on two points. Clinton had no direct role in sending the memo, even though it went out under her name. And while the memo encouraged staffers to avoid using personal email accounts, it fell short of prohibiting their use. These points diminish the accuracy of Scarborough’s statement, but not critically. We rate the claim Mostly True. Update: We’ve added some additional context provided by Clinton at her March 10, 2015, U.N. press conference.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A464540>],/factchecks/2015/mar/10/joe-scarborough/scarborough-clinton-told-state-department-staff-no/

Is today's poverty rate in Selma, Ala., nine times higher for blacks than whites?
","In its coverage of the 50th anniversary of the landmark civil rights clash in Selma, Ala., NBC’s Meet the Press talked to several people who live there about ""what has changed and what hasn't,"" as host Chuck Todd put it. One of those interviewed was Henry Sanders, a state senator whose district includes Selma. Here’s what he said: ""I was elected to the Senate in 1983. So I've been here more than 32 years. It's still two Selmas. The unemployment rate for African-Americans is roughly three times that of whites. But the poverty rate is roughly nine times that of whites. So there are two Selmas. I don't know of a black-owned business here on Main Street. All the blacks go to their churches and all the whites go to their churches, most of the children are in separate schools."" It didn’t surprise us that there is a racial gap between rich and poor in Selma. But is the poverty rate really nine times as high for blacks as it is for whites? We turned to figures from the U.S. Census Bureau to find out. To cover our demographic bases, we looked at the poverty measures for not one but two jurisdictions -- the city of Selma, and the county to which it belongs, Dallas County. In the city of Selma, the Census Bureau counted 3,562 white residents and 15,908 black residents on average between 2009 and 2013. The poverty rate for the white population was 14.4 percent, compared to 48.4 for the black population. That’s a stunningly high percentage of people in poverty -- nearly half of all African Americans in the city are counted as impoverished. Still, Sanders exaggerated the degree of difference between black and white poverty rates in the city. The black rate is about 3.4 times the white rate, not nine times higher. Dallas County, meanwhile, had 12,413 white residents and 29,402 black residents. The poverty rates were 13.6 percent for whites and 44.9 percent for blacks. That makes the ratio almost identical to Selma itself -- 3.3 times higher for blacks. Even taking into account the Census Bureau’s stated margins of error -- roughly plus-or-minus 5 percentage points for Selma and plus-or-minus 3 percentage points for Dallas County -- Sanders' claim is off base for the poverty rate. He’s closer when comparing the unemployment rate -- unemployment is about 2.3 times higher for blacks in Selma and 2.5 times higher for blacks in Dallas County. That’s a little less than the ""roughly three times"" Sanders cited. Experts said that Sanders has an underlying point, despite the inflated numbers. ""The transformational changes of the past few decades, including the election of black leaders, have not transformed the local economies of most small, rural, poor areas of the southern ‘Black Belt,’ ""said Glen Browder, a former Democratic congressman from Alabama and emeritus political science professor at Jacksonville State University. ""Whether that reflects racial or educational or economic factors or a combination of factors is debatable, but the reality is that economic development is a difficult assignment in such communities."" William H. Stewart, a University of Alabama political scientist, said impoverished communities sometimes ""look"" worse than the statistics officially say they are. ""The mostly poorer housing conditions endured by blacks reinforce the impression that a much greater disparity exists between whites and blacks than is shown from the objective statistics,"" Stewart said. Sanders did not respond to a voicemail and an email. Our ruling Sanders said that today in Selma, Ala., ""the poverty rate is roughly nine times that of whites."" There’s no question that a substantial economic gap exists between blacks and whites in Selma and Dallas County, even a half-century after ""Bloody Sunday."" But documented poverty rates are a little over three times higher for blacks -- not nine times, as Sanders said. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966686C0>],/factchecks/2015/mar/10/henry-sanders/todays-poverty-rate-selma-ala-nine-times-higher-bl/

In Madison, black adults are 8 times more likely than white adults to be arrested?

","Two months before the fatal police shooting of an African-American man in Madison, an activist group called the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition decried what it called ""the violence of heavy policing and arrest-rate disparities in Madison."" In an open letter issued Jan. 9, 2015, the Madison-based group called on Police Chief Mike Koval to ""dramatically reduce the number of police contacts with black people and poor people,"" and it made this claim: ""Given that the arrest rate shows that black people are eight times more likely to be arrested than white people, we demand that disparity cut in half by the end of 2015."" In the wake of the March 6, 2015 shooting death of 19-year-old Tony T. Robinson Jr., we thought we would take a look at the claim, which was repeated by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) three days after the shooting. Robinson case According to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news reports: Madison police were called shortly before 6:30 p.m. when Robinson started jumping in front of cars on Williamson Street on Madison’s east side. Then in swift succession, Robinson apparently hit a friend and, after entering a house, tried to strangle someone else. A police officer entered the home, got into a struggle with Robinson and shot him. Robinson was not armed. The officer was injured, but did not need to be hospitalized. The shooting quickly drew comparisons by some with other recent high-profile killings by police of black men across the country: Dontre Hamilton at Red Arrow Park in Milwaukee, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. and Eric Garner in New York City. Protests followed Robinson’s death. One protest, three days after the shooting, drew more than 1,000 people to the State Capitol. Nearly a year before he was killed, on April 25, 2014, Robinson, then 18, was arrested with three other people in connection with an armed home invasion at a Madison apartment.  He pleaded guilty to felony armed robbery and received three years of probation. The officer who shot Robinson, Matt Kenny, who is white, shot and killed a 48-year-old white man in the line of duty on July 15, 2007, after the man pointed what turned out to be a pellet gun at Kenny. The officer did not know the weapon was a pellet gun, and the district attorney cleared Kenny. The claim The Young, Gifted and Black Coalition based its claim on an October 2013 report on racial disparities in Dane County. So, although the claim was about Madison, the report examined the larger surrounding area. The report was done by the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a Madison-based liberal advocacy group whose research is respected. The report said that in 2012, African-American adults were arrested in Dane County at a rate more than eight times that of whites. Here are the adult arrest rates per 1,000 adults in 2012:   Black Adults White Adults Ratio of black to white Dane County 295 36 8.19 Wisconsin 230 53 4.34 United States 82 33 2.48   Erica Nelson, the author of the report, told us the figures were developed from an unpublished report of the state Office of Justice Assistance. She said she is working on developing figures strictly for Madison, rather than Dane County, but wouldn’t speculate on how the Madison rate might differ from the county rate. When the coalition first made its claim in the open letter, the police chief responded in a blog post, saying: ""I have always agreed that the harmful impacts of racial disparity in Dane County are not in dispute. An education system that has underserved people of color, high rates of unemployment and underemployment, a lack of suitable guardians or mentors for our youth (leading to greater gang involvement), challenged neighborhoods and a criminal justice system that is fraught with inadequacies are but a few of the drivers that contribute to the malaise we face as a community."" But, he added: ""Based on the diversity and the strength of character personified in our workforce, the training which is second to none and ever-striving for best practices, coupled with checks-and-balances that serve to bring rogue cops or practices to the light of day, I will not buy into the naive supposition that our community's disparity issues are largely owing to a pervasive pattern of systemic racism by MPD."" When we asked Koval about the eight times higher claim, he responded by email through a spokesman, saying that in his initial response to the open letter ""I was not disputing the fact that there are racial disparities; I dispute the fact that I have ‘rogue’ cops or policies/procedures which are intrinsically racist.  There is no doubt but that the police should be mindful of our role as the gatekeepers to the criminal justice system, and therefore ‘own’ part of this problem."" The chief also noted that the figures from the report are for all of Dane County, not just Madison, which ""includes big bedroom communities"" such as Fitchburg and Sun Prairie. Koval said he has not seen any figures for only Madison. Our rating The Young, Gifted and Black Coalition said ""black people are eight times more likely to be arrested than white people"" in Madison. A report the coalition relies on says that in 2012, the arrest rate for black adults was eight times higher than for white adults. However, the figures were for all of Dane County, not merely for Madison, the county’s largest city. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.  To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page. Note: After we published this item, the author of the research report cited above said she generated new figures strictly for the City of Madison, rather than Dane County, and provided them to PolitiFact Wisconsin.

Rick Perry errs in tying patriotism quote to Thomas Paine

","Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry drew inspiration from one of the nation’s founding fathers during a speech at a recent fundraising dinner for the Republican Party of Virginia. ""Thomas Paine wrote that ‘the duty of a patriot is to protect his country from his government,’"" Perry said, drawing applause from the crowd during his Feb. 24 event at the Richmond Marriott. Paine, a prolific pamphleteer during the Revolutionary War, authored essays such as ""Common Sense"" and ""The American Crisis"" that took aim at British rule of the colonies. His words remain widely cited by conservatives to support their calls for limited government. We wondered whether Perry had quoted Paine correctly. We turned to the National Thomas Paine Historical Association in New Rochelle, N.Y., which posts Paine’s major writings. You can find plenty of patriotic passages there, some of them published while Gen. George Washington suffered battlefield losses in 1776. ""These are the times that try men’s souls,"" Paine wrote. ""The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country. But he that stands now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered."" But many quotes have been mistakenly attributed to Paine, and the association also notes on its website what its hero did not write. Among them is a virtually identical phrase the former Texas governor attributed to Paine:  ""The duty of a patriot is to protect his country from its government."" Gary Berton, secretary of the association, told us, ""I’ve read every word of Paine’s several times. It’s definitely not Paine.""   Berton, who has studied Paine’s writings for decades, said the phrase doesn’t even sound like a thought the founding father would convey. Paine was certainly critical of Britiain’s rule of the colonies and hoped society would one day become so advanced that it wouldn’t need government, Berton said. ""But in the meantime, he was for a strong central government with redistribution of wealth,"" added Berton, who is also the coordinator of the Institute of Thomas Paine Studies at Iona College in New Rochelle. Harvey Kaye, a history professor at the University of Wisconsin Green Bay who wrote a 2006 book about Paine, also told us the quote didn’t come from the pamphleteer. Many conservatives in recent decades have tried to turn Paine into an ""anti-statist prophet,"" Kaye said in an email. ""But Paine was a radical, small-d democratic patriot who opposed monarchical & aristocratic government and called for independence and the making of democratic republic (Common Sense, 1776), proposed a social security system (Rights of Man, 1792), and argued for taxing the propertied because God intended the earth for all to share and the concentration of power and wealth produced poverty for working people (see Agrarian Justice, 1797),"" Kaye wrote. So where did Perry’s misattributed quote come from? Berton said it appears to have been penned by Edward Abbey, an American anarchist, environmentalist and novelist. Two weeks before Abbey died in 1989, he published ""A Voice Crying in the Wilderness,"" a collection of sayings and quotes that came from a private journal he kept for 21 years. ""A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government,"" Abbey wrote in his book. Berton said the attribution to Paine appears to have spread through the Internet. We can’t swear that Abbey coined the saying.  In a humorous introduction to his book, Abbey noted that many of the collected sayings came from his earlier writings. ""Others may be unconscious plagiarisms from the great and the dead (never steal from the living and mediocre), ideas absorbed in my reading so long ago that I’ve made them mine and forgotten the source,"" Abbey wrote. ""If so, the author would appreciate hearing from readers on this point. (Be kind.)"" Finally, we should note that we reached out to the Perry camp several times while researching this article and did not get a response. Our ruling Perry says Paine wrote that ‘the duty of a patriot is to protect his country from his government.’"" He offers no proof or citation of where Paine wrote that phrase. Two Paine scholars tell us the quote didn’t originate with the founding father and that the saying doesn’t appear in any of Paine’s writings.

Rand Paul gets it wrong on fate of Libyan missiles
","Terrorists have thousands of dangerous missiles, and it’s former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s fault, said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. Paul, a potential 2016 contender, threw some jabs at Clinton in his Feb. 27 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference. In particular, he pointed to the United States’ military involvement in the 2011 Libyan uprising, during Clinton’s term as secretary of state. ""Hillary's war in Libya is a perfect example,"" Paul said. ""Hillary's war made us less safe. Libya's less stable, and radical jihadists run amok. They swim in our swimming pool! Hillary's war in Libya allowed thousands of surface-to-air missiles to fall into the hands of radical Islamists. As Hillary was declaring victory in Libya, Ambassador Stevens was pleading for more security."" We were intrigued by Paul’s claim that radical Islamists got their hands on ""thousands"" of surface-to-air missiles. The United States has worked for years to destroy tens of thousands of man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) around the globe. These over-the-shoulder surface-to-air missiles are easy to transport, and they pose serious danger to both commercial and military aircraft. We found that it’s likely terrorists have acquired a few Libyan MANPADS as a result of the conflict, but experts told us that there is no way they number in the thousands, or even dozens. Moreover, experts told us U.S. military involvement isn’t to blame. American programs actually reduced by thousands the number of MANPADS accessible to terrorists. ""There is currently insufficient evidence to support the claim that radical Islamist groups have obtained ‘thousands’ of Libyan MANPADS,"" said Jeremy Binnie, the Middle East/Africa editor for Jane’s Defense Weekly. Where did they go? The 2011 U.S.-backed Libyan uprising -- part of the Arab Spring -- toppled the decades-long dictator Col. Muammar Gaddafi. At the time, the State Department estimated that Gaddafi had amassed about 20,000 MANPADS over 40 years. Paul's office sent us news reports from 2011 regarding the many MANPADS that went missing during the conflict; most were looted or destroyed. There was real concern that they would end up in the hands of terrorists. Three years later, a United Nations Panel of Experts report found: ""Fears that terrorist groups would acquire these weapons have materialized."" According to the report, Libyan MANPADS are known to have been smuggled into Chad, Lebanon, Mali and Tunisia, and authorities seized some found on a boat headed to Syrian insurgents.  It’s also possible, but unconfirmed, that they’ve made their way to Egypt and Gaza. The MANPADS found in Mali and Tunisia were confirmed to be part of terrorists’ arsenals. But the idea that terrorists even had access to ""thousands"" of operable MANPADS is inexplicable, experts told us. First, Libya’s 20,000 MANPADS were amassed over 40 years. The U.N. report said only some would still be usable today, despite their age. Others were acquired in pieces and cannot be reassembled because they are missing key components, said William Lawrence, a professor at George Washington University's Elliott School, who previously worked at the United States Embassy in Tripoli, Libya. The missiles destined for Syria, for example, did not include launchers. Also, some of the weapons were controlled by anti-Gaddafi rebels, whom the U.S. supported, Lawrence added. As for the claim that U.S. military involvement is somehow to blame for any missiles falling into the wrong hands, Libyan rebels were seen with looted MANPADS before the United States got involved in March 2011, Binnie said. There is a long paper trail of America’s role in drastically reducing Libya’s MANPADS arsenal. The United States military spent about $2 billion and several months in Libya as part of a U.N.-sanctioned NATO coalition intent on toppling Gaddafi. In the mission, NATO airstrikes destroyed Libyan weapons depots, and in the process, according to the administration, eliminated thousands of MANPADS. Further, a major aspect of the United States’ diplomatic mission in Libya was a $40 million program to aid the U.S.-backed transitional government in regaining control over Libya’s weapons -- MANPADS in particular. The program -- which one State Department official called ""the most extensive effort to combat the proliferation of MANPADS in U.S. history"" -- recovered more than 5,000 Libyan MANPADS. According to the State Department, getting rid of Libya’s MANPADS were part of diplomatic discussions with Libya long before the 2011 uprising.   So let’s review: Of those 20,000 MANPADS -- the United States recovered 5,000, NATO destroyed thousands, the U.S.-backed transitional government acquired many, and many are inoperable. While we know terrorists got their hands on a few, it’s highly unlikely that they have ""thousands."" A line in the U.N. report Though the evidence overwhelmingly is against Paul, one line in the U.N. report threw us a curveball: ""Panel sources stated that thousands of MANPADS were still available in arsenals controlled by a wide array of non-state actors with tenuous or non-existent links to Libyan national authorities."" If thousands of MANPADS are still in the hands of ""non-state actors,"" could that mean thousands are available to terrorists? Not likely, Binnie said. While Libya has some radical Islamic non-state actors, the county also has numerous local tribes and militias (who aren’t terrorists) that formed during the uprisings who likely stockpiled MANPADS. ""While Ansar al-Sharia and other radical groups affiliated to the Islamic State are operating in Libya, they remain very much a minority,"" Binnie said. It’s also worth noting that there have been no documented instances of a shootdown using Libyan MANPADS since the 2011 conflict, said Karim Mezran, senior fellow at the Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East. ""The Islamist groups have been bombed from the air daily in the last six months,"" Mezran said. ""If they have thousands (of MANPADS) why haven't they used them so far?"" Our ruling Paul said that U.S. military involvement in Libya ""allowed thousands of surface-to-air missiles to fall into the hands of radical Islamists."" Experts told us that even though some terrorists are known to have a few Libyan surface-to-air missiles, the idea that they have ""thousands"" is extremely unlikely. While many of Libya’s 20,000 surface-to-air missiles went missing during the conflict, thousands more were destroyed, recovered, rendered inoperable or believed to be in the hands of militias that aren’t radical Islamic terrorists. It’s also incorrect to say the United States’ military involvement caused these missiles to go missing. The weapon looting began before the United States and NATO showed up. And when they showed up, they destroyed or recovered many thousands. It’s arguable that American involvement had the exact opposite effect than what Paul asserts. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate Paul’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2BCDC0>],/factchecks/2015/mar/09/rand-paul/paul-gets-it-wrong-fate-libyan-missiles/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker: UW tuition will be lower than ""just about any other campus""
","As Gov. Scott Walker’s presidential star continued to rise, Chris Wallace, host of Fox News Sunday, challenged him on how his budget treats the University of Wisconsin System. ""You cut funding, state funding for the University of Wisconsin higher education system by 13 percent. You cut funding for the state parks system by 28 percent,"" Wallace said during the March 1, 2015 interview. ""Governor, are those your priorities?"" Walker responded by noting that critics said his 2011 budget cuts would devastate K-12 education, but graduation rates and reading scores are up. That led to this exchange: WALLACE: But the University of Wisconsin says they're going to have to raise tuition on students. WALKER: But they're not. We have a two-year tuition freeze. WALLACE: I know, but they're saying after that. WALKER: Going forward, we have a cap on it tied to inflation. And so, we will be much more affordable than just about any other campus in America. At issue are fears that big tuition hikes could be coming after 2017. They stem from Walker’s proposed Walker’s tuition freeze between 2015 and 2017, which would stymie UW from raising more revenue via tuition to replace the $300 million aid cut the governor wants. Walker is saying a big tuition increase won’t happen, and that UW schools will be near the top in affordability nationally. Let’s hit the books. We asked Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for Our American Revival, a group Walker formed as he explores a 2016 presidential bid, to back up Walker’s claim. She pointed us to 2014-’15 figures for tuition and fees at universities in other states compared with UW-Madison and at four-year public universities in Wisconsin as a group. The numbers come from a good source -- the College Board’s survey of college pricing trends. But Wisconsin is right in the middle of the pack or somewhat worse by various measures, the numbers show. -- All four-year schools: Among the states, Wisconsin’s average cost of in-state tuition and fees at these schools -- the ""sticker price"" at least -- ranked 26th highest.   -- Flagship campuses: UW-Madison tuition and fees ranked 22nd highest compared to flagship campuses in the other 49 states. -- Two-year campuses: Wisconsin’s costs ranked 15th highest. Among four-year schools in the Big Ten (now with 14 schools), Nebraska, Iowa and Maryland charged less in 2014-’15 than Wisconsin. A gap of $2,000 to $3,000 a year separates Wisconsin and the least expensive states. Of course, nobody knows how the tuition rankings will look down the road after Walker’s freeze. But it would take a lot more than a freeze to put Wisconsin near the most affordable states. Cap on tuition? Next let’s look at Walker’s contention that ""Going forward, we have a cap on it tied to inflation."" The governor’s pending 2015-’17 budget plan would freeze tuition for the two years -- but it applies only to that period. Wallace, though, specifically asked about what happens after that. So that was the period Walker was citing when he referenced a ""cap"" going forward. Walker did suggest in February 2015 during a trade mission to the United Kingdom that he was ""open"" to the notion of putting an inflationary lid on tuition past 2016-’17. The idea drew criticism from UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank, who said it contradicted Walker’s plan to spin off the UW System as an independent authority with control over its budget and more ability to find efficiencies. In any case, no ongoing cap is in place. It’s not even formally introduced anywhere and Walker said he had no specific plan. So it’s not nearly the done deal Walker made it sound like. Our rating Walker said the University of Wisconsin schools ""will be much more affordable than just about any other campus in America"" because ""going forward we have a cap on it tied to inflation."" His evidence is current rankings, but they show the state is neither high nor low for student costs. And the inflationary cap the governor mentioned remains only a gleam in his eye. We rate his claim False. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972F8DC0>],/factchecks/2015/mar/09/scott-walker/scott-walker-uw-tuition-will-be-lower-just-about-a/
"['Immigration', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'John Fredericks']","
John Fredericks says every illegal immigrant can be eligible for up to $38,000 in tax credits
","John Fredericks, a conservative radio talk show host whose program airs across much of Virginia, has been incensed for months that President Barack Obama bypassed Congress to extend legal status to millions of immigrants. Adding to the outrage, Fredericks says, are recent disclosures that all of these immigrants can be eligible for big tax breaks. Here’s a comment Fredericks made on his Feb. 28 show: ""Now we find out that every one of these illegals who came into this country illegally, that worked illegally, broke the law a number of times, now they can be eligible for up to $36,000 to $38,000 in earned income tax credits without paying a dime in."" Fredericks made the statement during an interview with U.S. Rep. Bob Hurt, R-5th. Hurt, no fan of Obama, replied, ""It’s an absolute nightmare."" On the same show, the radio personality repeated himself during an interview with U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-9th. Griffith replied, ""I’m fighting like crazy to stop this president and his bad policies that are detrimental to the United States of America."" The so-called ""amnesty bonuses"" have become a talking point in conservative circles. We wondered whether Fredericks is right that, under Obama’s policies, every illegal immigrant could become eligible for up to $38,000 in tax credits -- even if they haven’t paid taxes. The tax credit Obama announced on Nov. 20 that he will delay deportation of immigrants who have lived illegally in the U.S. for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards. If the applicants pass background checks and pay a fee, they would qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for three years at a time. More than 4 million people could qualify for the program, which is scheduled to open for applications this spring but faces a legal challenge from 26 states. Those who qualify for the program would also be able to get a Social Security number because a longstanding policy allows people who have been legally present in the U.S. to obtain the numbers. And with that Social Security number, they would be required to file tax returns and possibly qualify for the earned income tax credit that helps low-income workers. But there’s more. The reclassified immigrants also would be eligible to file or amend tax returns going back three years, provided they can meet income requirements and furnish pay documents. In other words, some will be able to claim four years of credits -- for their current tax filing and three years of back filings. The earned income tax credit slides with the amount of earnings families report and the number of children they have. It’s also adjusted each year for inflation. The maximum amount a family with three or more children can claim this year on their 2014 tax filings is $6,242. The top amount that could be claimed over the last four years, according to IRS documents is $24,320 -- well short of Fredericks’ claim. Of the 28.8 million families that applied for the tax credit on 2012 filings, only 3.5 million -- or 12 percent -- had three or more children, according to IRS figures. To qualify for the maximum credit, those families’ taxable income could have been no greater than about $23,000 a year. Only 1.3 million of those three-child or more families fell into that category, according to computations of IRS data by John Wancheck, who coordinates a program to publicize the earned income tax credit for the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. In other words, only 6.4 percent of families applying for the tax credit in 2012 were eligible for the maximum benefit of about $6,000. The average credit was $2,407. So it’s likely, Wancheck said, that only a small percentage of reclassified immigrants would qualify for the maximum, three-child credit any given year, yet alone four years in a row. Wancheck said certain issues may deter immigrants from trying to recoup the credit from past years: Many may not have the tax records necessary to file back returns; others may be reluctant to go through the hassle for what might end up being a small reward. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen recently told Congress that his agency has not estimated the cost of extending the tax credit to reclassified immigrants. So how did Fredericks come up with the $36,000 to $38,000 credit that he said ""everyone of these illegals...can be eligible for?"" Fredericks sent us an email noting that in 2013, the maximum credit for three children or more was was $6,044. ""So two single illegals living together filing separately with 6 or more kids in the household can claim 3 each and it’s 6,044 x 2 = $12,088 x 3 years = $36,264,"" he wrote. It’s possible that Fredericks’ hypothetical households exist, but odds are there aren’t many of them. As we’ve noted, 6.4 percent of the families that applied for credit in 2012 qualified for the maximum three-child benefit. That’s about one in 16 families that year. The chances that two such families would live together for three years -- sharing income and filing separate tax returns -- are much lower. Tax payments Fredericks, in his radio statement, also said that all reclassified immigrants can be eligible for the maximum credit "" without paying a dime in."" This claim runs into trouble because those who will qualify for the credit would have been paying payroll taxes this year and in any past years they would seek to recoup. Although some illegal immigrants work in the underground economy and do not report their income to the government, others do. The IRS issues those workers an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) and accepts their filings without reporting them to immigration authorities. That’s designed to encourage them to pay taxes. A 2011 study by the Department of Treasury estimated 3 million ITIN holders filed federal taxes that year, with 2.3 million getting refunds and 700,000 paying arrears. Stephen Goss, Social Security’s chief actuary, told the Associated Press in February that illegal immigrants have paid $100 billion in Social Security payroll taxes during the last ten years, even though few will be able to collect benefits when they retire. A final note: As we said earlier, a coalition of 26 states -- not including Virginia -- has filed a suit challenging Obama’s action. It contends that Obama exceeded his presidential authority by granting temporary legal status to immigrants without getting approval from Congress. A U.S. District Court judge in Texas has blocked the immigration program until there is a trial on the suit. The White House has appealed the judge’s action. Our ruling Fredericks says, ""Now we find out that every one of these illegals who came into this country illegally, that worked illegally, broke the law a number of times, now they can be eligible for up to $36,000 to $38,000 in earned income tax credits without paying a dime in."" He’s wrong for a number of reasons: The maximum credits any family could receive is $24,320 for the four most recent tax years. ""Everyone of these illegals"" is not eligible for the maximum credit. To qualify, a family must have at least three children and a taxable income of no more than about $23,000 a year. Only 6.4 percent of families that applied for the credit in 2012  fell into that category. To receive back payments, immigrants would have to produce earning documents from past years. You can’t get the credit ""without paying a dime in."" You’d have to pay payroll taxes. Fredericks offers a scenario in which two families living together with three children apiece could claim $36,000 in combined credits if they file taxes separately. But this hypothetical situation lies on the margins and doesn’t buttress Fredericks’ claim that all reclassified immigrants can be eligible for up to the maximum credit. We rate Fredericks’ statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F17500>],/factchecks/2015/mar/09/john-fredericks/john-fredericks-says-every-illegal-immigrant-can-b/

Fact-checking Chuck Schumer's defense of Hillary Clinton's private email
","Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton didn’t appear on the Sunday political talk shows to explain her use of a private email account to conduct State Department business. But Democrats were out in force to defend her as proxies. For example, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., appeared March 8 on CBS’ Face the Nation to throw cold water on accusations of wrongdoing on the part of Clinton. ""The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over, and she’s the only one who’s done it,"" Schumer said. We decided to dig into Schumer’s claim. Spokesman Matt House said Schumer was referring to an October 2014 letter from the State Department to former secretaries of states. The letter has not been publicly published but its contents were outlined by State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf to the media last week. Harf said the letter was part of a routine effort to update record preservation and asked former secretaries to turn over emails containing state work conducted on personal accounts. A couple months after the request, Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails and documents from a personal email account created on a self-operated server, according to the New York Times and the State Department. Clinton has since requested (via Twitter) for those emails to be released. It’s not as though the letter went out to living secretaries of state dating back to Henry Kissinger. While it may be hard to remember a time before email, only four former secretaries have held the job during the prominence of electronic communications: Clinton, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright. As it is, the State Department query was limited to just those four individuals. Two of those individuals haven’t provided personal emails for good reason: They didn’t use email much during their time at the State Department. According to MSNBC, an aide for Albright said she ""did not use email while she was in office"" from 1997 to 2001. Similarly, Rice, head of the State Department from 2005 to 2009, was not a habitual emailer either, according to multiple reports. As Harf noted in a State Department briefing, ""Secretary Rice has repeatedly said that she did not regularly use email,"" and a spokesperson for Rice told ABC, ""She did not use personal email for official communication as secretary."" Essentially, two of the four former officials contacted didn’t turn any emails over because they didn’t have any to turn over. That’s pretty important context. And what about Powell, who served as Secretary of State during President George W. Bush’s first term? Powell appeared on ABC’s This Week to answers those questions. Apparently, Powell can’t turn over any documents. Why? Because he doesn’t have them anymore. ""I retained none of those e-mails and we are working with the State Department to see if there's anything else they want to discuss with me about those emails,"" he said. ""I did not keep a cache of them. I did not print them off,"" he added. ""I do not have thousands of pages somewhere in my personal files."" Harf acknowledged in a March 4 briefing that Powell's ""account has been closed for a number of years,"" and said, ""He’s looking to see if there’s anything responsive he still has."" You can draw your own conclusions about Powell not saving official emails from a 10-year-old account, and the relevance of that revelation to the Clinton controversy. Powell said most of his important correspondence would have been archived already, since they were sent to staff who had State Department accounts. But it does shed light on why Powell didn’t provide emails to the State Department, and it also demonstrates that he has taken steps to comply with the request, even if only recently. So to recap: The State Department reached out to four former secretaries asking about personal email accounts. Two have said they rarely used email, the third used personal email but had no records to turn over and the fourth was Clinton. That makes Schumer’s defense fairly hollow when you think about it. Clinton may have been the ""only"" person to provide emails, but realistically, that’s from a potential pool of two people. We took all this back to Schumer’s spokesman House. He stood by the comment. ""There is another person (Powell) who specifically said he had emailed in a way that would be relevant to their request, but did not keep records so wouldn't be able to comply,"" House said. ""So she's the only one to do what State is asking."" Our ruling Schumer said, ""The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over, and (Clinton is) the only one who’s done it."" That statement is much more grandiose than the reality of the situation. The State Department asked four former secretaries of state for any official business conducted on personal emails. Two of those individuals, Albright and Rice, rarely used email at all while in office, let alone on a personal account. The other, Powell, has said his personal emails no longer exist, but said he is working with the State Department to recover them, if possible. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. Correction: Clinton turned over 55,000 pages and documents from her private email account. A previous version of this fact-check described the number incorrectly.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B2DE80>],/factchecks/2015/mar/08/charles-schumer/fact-checking-chuck-schumers-defense-hillary-clint/

Lindsey Graham has it wrong on 'Meet the Press': Labor participation rate is not at an all-time low
","A shrinking unemployment rate isn’t enough for Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to say the economy is bouncing back from the recession. On NBC’s Meet the Press March 8, host Chuck Todd noted that unemployment is at its lowest since May 2008. And in 2014, unemployment went down in every state — a first since 1984. Todd asked Graham if Republicans — who have criticized President Barack Obama’s economic policies — could admit that some progress has been made. ""I think that we do have stagnant middle-class wage growth, and I think the labor participation rate is at an all-time low,"" Graham said. ""So if your argument is that we’re on the road to recovery, we had a sound economy under President Obama, no I don’t agree with that at all."" Pointing out that the labor participation rate has been on the decline is a typical retort among Republicans in response to arguments that the unemployment rate is shrinking. While low unemployment rate is generally a good thing, economists also say you want a high labor participation rate. That’s because the higher the rate, the more members of the working-age population that are actively seeking employment. But is today’s labor participation rate at an ""all-time low""? Not so. As of February, the labor participation rate is 62.8 percent, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Rates were consistently lower than what they are today from 1948 through 1978 — with the lowest point at 58.1 percent in December 1954. (Available data goes back to 1948.) Below is a graph showing the trend since 1950:  In fairness to Graham, today’s labor participation rate is essentially the lowest it’s been since 1978. The rate increased steadily from the mid 1960s through the late 1990s, when it hit a peak of 67 percent. Since Obama has been in office, the rate has dropped 2.9 percentage points. Much of the increase in the labor participation rate in the second half of the 20th century largely has to do with a massive increase in the number of women seeking employment as a result of changes such as better access to contraceptives and anti-gender discrimination legislation, according to an economic report out of the White House, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data. This major social difference in the country’s workforce makes it difficult to compare labor participation rates today to those 50 years ago. Another important reason for labor participation rate increase through the 1990s was the fact that baby boomers reached their ""peak working years,"" according to the report. Factors contributing to current decline are up for debate. On the one hand, there’s concern that people are discouraged about their job prospects. The slow recovery from the recent recession may have prompted people to go back to school, stay at home with their kids or give up on a job search altogether. But absent the recession, labor participation would have dropped anyway, Brookings economist Gary Burtless told PolitiFact in 2013. Why? Because the baby boomers have started to retire. And as the population gets older, fewer people will be working overall, meaning the labor participation rate will continue to decline in the coming decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally the rate of female labor participation — which increased rapidly through the 1990s — has since plateaued and declined slightly. (The labor participation rate among men has decreased more.)   The White House report found that half the decline in labor participation is a result of the aging population, while the other half is a combination of cyclical economic trends, the recession and existing trends such as the decline of female workers. The report also notes that while labor force participation among young adults has declined about 0.8 percentage points a year since 2007, school and college enrollment has increased. So the rate of young adults either working or in school has remained relatively unchanged. Our ruling Graham said, ""The labor participation rate is at an all-time low.""  Graham’s office did not respond to multiple emails seeking comment. The rate was lower than it is today from 1948 to 1978. That said, it's not necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison and the labor participation is at about its lowest level in 37 years.  The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280979F5E80>],/factchecks/2015/mar/08/lindsey-graham/lindsey-graham-has-it-wrong-meet-press-labor-parti/

Gov. Gina Raimondo says R.I. is ‘well below average’ in number of public employees
","Governor Raimondo sounded an alarm about state spending and looming budget deficits at a news conference last month. ""Out of whack … Alarming … Scary,"" she said. Her presentation included facts and figures about public employees and their salaries. ""Contrary to popular belief, we actually don’t have that many public employees…We are well below average in the number of public employees,"" she said. When we called Raimondo’s office, Marie Aberger, the governor’s spokeswoman, told us that Raimondo was referring to all federal, state and municipal employees, including educators, when she said ""public employees."" The governor’s office forwarded a chart to us that was compiled using U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics information from November 2013. It showed that Rhode Island had the lowest percentage of government employees in New England. According to the chart, a total of 59,800, or 11.6 percent, of the state’s 514,100 jobs are in the public sector. New Hampshire was second lowest, with 12.5 percent, followed by Massachusetts (13.1 percent), Connecticut (13.3 percent), Maine (15 percent) and Vermont (16.3 percent).   But those are just the New England numbers. Where does Rhode Island rank nationally in percentage of public employees? We got those figures when we reached out to the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training. Spokesman Michael J. Healey provided us with calculations from its labor market information division. Donna Murray, assistant director of the division, compared the number of government jobs -- including federal workers and educators -- to the number of non-farm jobs in every state and determined what percentage the public-sector jobs made up. Those calculations indicated that as of December 2014, the state had a total of 59,700 government jobs, which accounted for 12.5 percent of the state’s 478,900 total positions. Of the state’s public sector jobs, 10,500 are federal, Murray said. This ties Rhode Island with Nevada as the states with the second lowest percentage of public employees in the nation. Pennsylvania was the sole state with a lower percentage, at 12.3 percent. By contrast, Wyoming had the highest percentage of public employees at 24.2 percent. Nationally, government jobs make up an average of 15.9 percent of total non-farm jobs, according to the department’s calculations. We wondered how Rhode Island compares when federal jobs are excluded, and only state and local workers are counted, since those are the jobs that impact state and municipal budgets. We contacted Governing, a non-partisan magazine and website that tracks politics, policy and management for state and local government leaders. It published its own analysis, entitled ""States With Most Government Employees: Per Capita Rates By Job Type"". (The governor’s office also referred us to this analysis.) The Governing analysis was published last March, using 2012 numbers. Mike Maciag, the data editor at Governing, agreed to run more current numbers for us to determine how Rhode Island’s rate of state and local public employees compares with rates of other states and the national average. Maciag used 2013 data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of Public Employment and Payroll for his calculations. According to the analysis, Rhode Island had 458 state and local employees -- including teachers -- per 10,000 residents, he said. This placed the Ocean State as the state with the seventh-lowest number of public employees in the country. Wyoming had the most public employees per 10,000 -- 866. Nevada had the least -- 368 . The national average was 538. For the record, according to Healey, Rhode Island had a total of 16,100 state employees as of December 2014. That includes 10,805 in state government, 4,612 in higher education, and 683 in the judiciary. Our ruling Governor Raimondo said that Rhode Island was ""well below average"" in the number of public employees. Information provided to us by the governor’s office and the state Department of Labor and Training support that claim, as does an analysis done by Governing,  the non-partisan magazine and website We rate her claim True.

R.I. GOP official Steven Frias says research finds no economic benefit from having sports franchise
","Debate has begun over a proposal by the new owners of the Pawtucket Red Sox to move the team to Providence, where they want to build a new riverfront stadium. The project is still in the planning phase, but the owners have said they intend to ask for some financial support from the state and the city, including possibly getting the state-owned land for the stadium for free. But would a new stadium be worth the price tag? Rhode Island’s Republican National Committeeman Steve Frias says no. In a Feb. 24, 2015 commentary in The Providence Journal, he said giving away the valuable land, which was freed up by the relocation of Route 195, would be a mistake. ""Research performed by economists has shown no consistent, positive impact on jobs, income or tax revenues arising from stadiums or sports franchises,"" Frias argued. We thought that claim was worth checking out. When we contacted him, he immediately referred us to a 2008 summary of research in the field by economists Dennis Coates of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and Brad Humphreys of West Virginia University. The authors reviewed more than 40 academic studies, spanning nearly two decades, that examined public subsidies for professional sports teams. Their findings were clear. ""There now exists almost 20 years of research on the economic impact of professional sports franchises and facilities on the local economy,"" they wrote, reporting that studies published in peer-reviewed economic journals show there is ""almost no evidence that professional sports franchises and facilities have a measurable economic impact on the economy."" And that's for major-league teams. In this case, we're talking about a minor league team, said Humphreys when we contacted him by phone. For example, he and Coates found no difference in economic impact between the years when teams were playing their regular schedules and five time periods when they didn't, due to strikes. And in a subsequent analysis, they found that having postseason games did not affect real per-person income in a city. Money may shift from one part of the economy to another, but there's no net benefit. The evidence is overwhelming, Coates and Humphreys wrote. ""Economists reach the nearly unanimous conclusion that ‘tangible’ economic benefits generated by professional sports facilities and franchises are very small; clearly far smaller than stadium advocates suggest and smaller than the size of the subsidies."" They also noted that in 2005, when a random group of economists was asked if they agreed or disagreed with the statement, ""Local and state governments in the U.S. should eliminate subsidies to professional sports franchises,"" 28 percent agreed and 58 percent strongly agreed. That's a whopping 86 percent. Only 5 percent disagreed. There are special-interest reports that claim an economic benefit and contend that every dollar invested in a sports franchise generates a specific amount of money, Humphreys said, but those are never published in reputable journals because ""you can make them say whatever you want them to say"" by tinkering with the assumptions that influence how the numbers are crunched. We posed the question to other experts, including Rick Eckstein, professor of sociology at Villanova University and author of ""Public Dollars, Private Stadiums: The Battle over Building Sports Stadiums."" ""There are absolutely no publicly subsidized stadiums and arenas that generate enough direct or indirect tax increases to balance the initial (and ongoing) public outlay,"" he said in an email. ""In fact, some research suggests that sports stadiums actually decrease economic activity and tax revenue in areas where they are built,"" said Eckstein. ""However, strategically placed stadiums and arenas can sometimes ride existing redevelopment trends, but they are never the cause of these trends."" Coates and Humphreys said there are several reasons to explain a lack of economic benefit. In many cases -- and this would be particularly true in Rhode Island -- the state would simply be transferring the economic activity from one city to another. And even if more people went to see the Sox in a new stadium, when people spend to go to a ballgame, ""local entertainment spending on sports increases and local entertainment spending on other activities like movies, bowling, etc. decreases."" There are other costs people need to weigh, they wrote. ""For every individual who derives enjoyment from the presence of the sports franchises in the community, there are likely to be other individuals who are uninterested in sports or even resent being taxed to subsidize an activity they have no use for."" And the money used to subsidize a move might be better spent ""for other public projects with higher social rates of return than a stadium"" such as construction and maintenance projects, or even reducing taxes. Supporters of public support for professional sports teams often point to intangible benefits, such as boosting civic pride. But that argument is beyond the scope of this item. So here's the box score.  Steven Frias said, ""Research performed by economists has shown no consistent, positive impact on jobs, income or tax revenues arising from stadiums or sports franchises."" It appears that he belted this one out of the park. We rate his claim True.

Scott Walker disavows support for path to citizenship
","On Feb. 4, 2015 we awarded Gov. Scott Walker a Half Flip for inconsistencies in how he framed his views on what to do about millions of illegal immigrants currently in the United States. Our focus was on Walker’s comments in light of a 2013 Wausau Daily Herald interview in which he clearly agreed ""it makes sense"" that people could not only stay here but get citizenship with the right mix of penalties and waiting periods and other requirements. Walker had muddied the waters in a Feb. 1, 2015 interview on ABC’s ""This Week"" program by declaring he was not for ""amnesty"" for those residents. Critics opposed to a ""pathway"" to legal citizenship disagreed, calling his position just that. In assigning Walker a Half Flip, which is defined by a partial change in position or inconsistent statements on an issue, we noted ""the truth is that we don’t really know whether he has a completely new position, because he wasn’t asked to clarify his views in detail."" (Worth noting: Two days after we issued the Half Flip, Walker in a Fox interview accused the Wausau newspaper of misquoting him despite video proving otherwise.) Walker’s position became a whole lot clearer in a March 1, 2015 interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. Faced with the public perception that he was equivocating on the issue as he weighs a 2016 presidential run, Walker tried to better define his position. That prompted us to return to the Flip-O-Meter. Our standard disclaimer applies: The Flip-O-Meter is not designed to say whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. Rather, it strictly looks at whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views on a topic. Pressed by Wallace in the interview, Walker at first continued to say he didn’t believe in amnesty, while not disavowing his endorsement of a path to citizenship in the 2013 Wausau interview. Wallace: The question was, can you envision a world where if these people paid a penalty, that they would have a path to citizenship? And you said, sure, that makes sense. Walker: I believe there's a way that you can do that... But Walker switched course when Wallace persisted: Wallace: But you said you supported it. Walker: And my view has changed. I'm flat out saying it. I'm -- candidates can say that. Sometimes they don't. I'm saying my -- Wallace: So, you've changed from 2013? Walker: Absolutely. I look at the problems we've experienced for the last few years. I've talked to governors on the border and others out there. I've talked to people all across America. And the concerns I have is that we need to secure the border. We ultimately need to put in place a system that works. A legal immigration system that works. And part of doing this is put the onus on employers, getting them E-Verify and tools to do that. But I don't think you do it through amnesty. So, Walker now says he’s changed his mind since agreeing that some pathway to citizenship makes sense. There may still be a bit of wiggle room in his position. But in our view Walker’s declarations now make this a Full Flop, which we define as a complete change in position. Indeed, he agreed he had ""absolutely"" changed his position. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DFB4C0>],/factchecks/2015/mar/06/scott-walker/scott-walker-disavows-support-path-citizenship/
"['Georgia', 'Immigration', 'Congress', 'Doug Collins']","
Collins largely on target
","Members of the U.S. House voted Tuesday to fund the Department of Homeland Security through September. The vote was a blow to a GOP-led threat to strike back at President Barack Obama for his executive action on immigration. All 10 Georgia Republicans voted ""No"" on the funding bill, which passed 257 to 167. Some Republicans wanted to add provisions to the bill to gut the legal protections that the president, by executive order, called to provide to as many as five million illegal immigrants. But after threat of a partial agency shutdown created a backlash, House Speaker John Boehner and the majority quietly capitulated Tuesday. They passed a ''clean'' funding bill with no immigration provisions. U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Gainesville, was among those who voiced frustration. ""It’s not what I would like to see,"" Collins said. Why, Collins asked, was the president willing to jeopardize funding for the Department of Homeland Security for ""a proposal that frankly he himself has said 22 times he couldn’t do?"" Sound familiar? It’s a claim PolitiFact has checked more than once and one that Republicans have repeated multiple times. The 22 citations were included in a blog posted by Boehner’s office in November and shared with us this week by Brendan Thomas, Collins’ spokesman. On Nov. 20, Obama announced he would delay deportations of illegal immigrants who have lived in the country more than five years, have children who are citizens or who have green cards. This would allow more than 4 million people to qualify for work permits and avoid deportation for three years, provided they each pass a background check and pay a fee. The president’s decision, which the GOP has denounced as an abuse of power, is on hold based on a temporary injunction from a federal judge in Texas. Our PolitiFact Texas colleagues checked the list for claims by politicians from that state. All of the citations in Boehner’s post were compared by PolitiFact Texas to transcripts and news stories. The majority of the examples are of Obama saying he did not have power to do more on immigration without Congress. Others, as we’ll explain in a moment, say something more nuanced or aren’t specific to immigration. We won’t go through every quote that supports Boehner’s point here, but here are a few we culled from a document created by PolitiFact Texas: In September 2012, Obama was asked if he would follow up his recent protective move for students by doing something similar for non-criminal immigrants such as the parents of U.S.-born children. Obama replied that ""as the head of the executive branch, there’s a limit to what I can do… we’re still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally,"" as in parents deported. (No. 13 on Boehner’s list.) At a presidential debate in October 2012, Obama and Mitt Romney were asked: ""What do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green card that are currently living here as productive members of society?"" Obama said: ""I've done everything that I can on my own."" (No. 14 on Boehner’s list.) In a January 2013 Telemundo interview, Obama was asked why he couldn’t protect mothers living here without authorization from deportation as he had served law-abiding students. ""I’m not a king,"" Obama replied, akin to his response the same month to a similar query from Univision. ""You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law. And-- you know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws-- we’ve got some discretion. We can prioritize-- what we do. But we can’t simply ignore the law."" (No. 16 on Boehner’s list.) So clearly there are examples of Obama saying he couldn’t do more with executive action, then later doing exactly that. That’s why PolitiFact previously rated Obama’s claim that ""my position hasn’t changed"" as False. What should not be counted Also included on the list of 22 are quotes where Obama was either suggesting his executive powers did not have hard limits or was silent on his executive power on immigration. Here are a few problems with quotes included on Boehner’s list. In two instances during his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama criticized ""signing statements"" used by President George W. Bush that interpret laws, but he did not bring up immigration. Immigration was also not part of his reply to a question at a 2010 MTV/BET event when he said, ""I can’t simply ignore laws that are out there,"" in response to a question about ""don’t ask, don’t tell.""  (Nos. 1, 2 and 5.) In September 2011, with his deferred-action plan on the horizon, Obama reiterated that he cannot just change laws unilaterally in response to a question about possible administrative relief for students who don’t have legal residency. But he hinted that there might be room within his authority, saying, ""what we can do is to prioritize enforcement, since there are limited enforcement resources."" (No. 12 on Boehner’s list.) Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a New York immigration attorney, reviewed the GOP citations for PolitiFact Georgia and concluded a number referred to ""deferred action,’ which, he said, ‘is not changing the law. ""It is simply prioritizing who should be targeted for deportation, for example serious criminals,"" he said.  ""... most legal scholars believe that these executive actions fall within the limits; they do not exceed them."" Kennesaw State University political science chair Kerwin Swint said the 22 statements ""do indicate the president felt, at the time, that immigration authority should go through Congress. ‘But, funny how circumstances change change one's principles,"" Swint said. ‘When his party lost control of the Senate in 2014, he felt like he had no other choice but to use executive authority.""    Our ruling Collins  said this: President Obama said ""22 times"" he could not authorize immigration reform by executive order. Obama did say that more than a dozen times. Other times it was something more nuanced or not specific to immigration. The broader point -- that Obama said one thing about executive action but did another -- is accurate. We rate Collins’ statement as Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809688D2C0>],/factchecks/2015/mar/06/doug-collins/collins/
"['Labor', 'Wisconsin', 'Julie Lassa']","
Julie Lassa says infant mortality rate is 15 percent higher in states with right-to-work laws
","The arguments against right-to-work legislation usually focus on economic matters. Supporters say such a law will make a state more friendly to business; opponents say it will reduce the strength of unions, and depress the state’s wages and incomes. The Republican-pushed bill, which prohibits employers from signing contracts with unions that require employees to pay union dues, was fast tracked in the Legislature and is expected to reach Gov. Scott Walker’s desk by March 6, 2015. When the state Senate debated the right-to-work bill Feb. 25, 2015, state Sen. Julie Lassa (D-Stevens Point) criticized the measure with the wages-and-income argument -- then she took it a step further. Said Lassa: ""Families in right-to-work states are less likely to have health insurance, and the infant mortality rate is 15 percent higher than in other states."" Wait. Babies are at greater risk of death in right-to-work states? Looking at the evidence When we asked Lassa for her evidence, her staff pointed to a Jan. 23, 2015 report by the liberal Economic Policy Institute written by Gordon Lafer, a political economist at the University of Oregon. His report says that by a number of measures -- including infant mortality rates -- Wisconsin fares better than the 24 states with right-to-work laws. And he says right-to-work states are worse off than those without such laws. For infant mortality numbers, Lafer relies on data from 2010 collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To do the right-to-work comparison, he added up the infant mortality rates in those states and divided by 24, to get 6.7 deaths per 1,000 births. The same approach for the other states found 5.8 deaths per 1,000 births. The difference is 15 percent. But simply adding up the rates and dividing by the number of states isn’t an accurate method because the calculation could be skewed by states with relatively more or fewer births and deaths, said Geoffrey Swain, medical director and chief medical officer for the City of Milwaukee Health Department, and an expert on infant mortality. His office provided the raw data from the CDC for births and infant deaths for 2012, the most recent year available. Using those numbers, right-to-work states had 6.48 deaths per 1,000 live births, while the remaining states (and the District of Columbia) had 5.54. The difference under this approach is actually larger -- 16.97 percent. So, Lassa is about right when it comes to the numbers. But she linked the number to right-to-work status, suggesting there is a causal relationship: One leads to the other. That’s a lot less clear, and it depends on the impact the law would have on the state’s economy, income and wages. And, of course, the sides disagree on that front. A study prepared for the conservative Wisconsin Policy Research Institute by Ohio University economist Richard Vedder argues that right-to-work laws added ""about six percentage points to the growth rate of RTW states from 1983 to 2013. With such a law, Wisconsin’s per capita personal income growth of 53.29 percent would have been, instead, about 59.29 percent."" Translated: right-to-work boosts the economy and wages. Lafer’s report comes to a much different conclusion. His study says right-to-work ""is associated with lower wages and benefits for both union and nonunion workers. In a RTW state, the average worker makes 3.2 percent less than a similar worker in a non-RTW state."" He also said average household income in right-to-work states is $6,430 less than in states without such laws. Of course, it’s impossible to predict how the law will affect jobs and wages in Wisconsin. The linkage Lafer -- and Lassa -- make also is based upon the idea that infant mortality rates are themselves correlated with poverty and other factors. Swain noted that a 2012 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that there was an improvement in key factors affecting infant mortality when the federal earned income tax credit -- targeted at low income people -- was expanded. Putting a relatively modest amount of money in the hands of the most needy helped, Swain said. ""These people are living on the margins and giving them a little more (income) would make a difference,"" Swain said. Therefore, he said, ""it’s likely that lower wages are going to lead  to worse outcomes."" For their part, CDC officials say they ""haven’t investigated the association between wages (or right to work states) and infant mortality."" Our rating Lassa says right-to-work states have higher infant mortality than states without such a law. She’s right on the raw numbers. But there are many more factors at work -- some of them are vigorously disputed -- when it comes to how such laws affect  wages, incomes and especially lower income people whose babies are more at risk. That’s simply not settled. Over the years, we have examined a series of claims that take a wage or job related statistic and say it is either better or worse in a right-to-work state. Generally, we have rated these Half True -- the statistic is right, but there is no clear evidence of a causal relationship. That fits here as well.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973BA900>],/factchecks/2015/mar/05/julie-lassa/julie-lassa-says-infant-mortality-rate-15-percent-/
"['New Hampshire', 'Legal Issues', 'Jennifer Horn']","
NH Republican Party says governor is required to notify Senate president of out-of-state travel
","Gov. Maggie Hassan traveled to private meetings in New York and Washington D.C. Monday, fanning speculation that she may consider a run for U.S. Senate in 2016 to challenge first-term Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte. In recent weeks, the New Hampshire Republican Party has taken aim at Hassan’s out-of-state travel schedule, claiming the New Hampshire Democrat is using the governor’s post as a ""political stepping stone"" to elevate her political career. Republican party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn filed several right-to-know requests seeking Hassan’s travel itinerary, and suggested that Hassan did not follow ""proper protocol"" by notifying the Senate President when she left the state.   In a letter sent to Hassan’s office, Horn writes that ""the governor must inform the Senate president about his or her absence from the state."" In response to Horn’s letter, Hassan responded that -- at the time -- she had only traveled outside the state once in 2015, to the border with Maine to attend the groundbreaking for a bridge reconstruction project. She has since traveled out of the state twice more. We wondered, is the governor required to tell the Senate president every time she leaves the state, whether on official business, for vacation or simply to go out for dinner in Boston? State Republican Party spokesman Ryan William pointed to the New Hampshire Constitution, part 2 article 49, which outlines who acts as governor when the office is vacant, and what qualifies as a vacancy.   That section states: ""In the event of the death, resignation, removal from office, failure to qualify, physical or mental incapacity, absence from the state, or other incapacity of the governor, the president of the senate, for the time being, shall act as governor until the vacancy is filled or the incapacity is removed."" The section furthers outlines when the powers of the governor are transferred as a result of an absence from the state in its concluding sentence:   ""While the governor or an acting governor is absent from the state on official business, he shall have the power and authority to transact such business."" In other words, under Article 49, the only time gubernatorial authority would fall to the Senate President due to the governor’s absence would be when the governor is away on unofficial business, such as a private vacation, said Martin Gross, senior counsel at the law firm Sulloway & Hollis and an expert in New Hampshire constitutional matters. So, if Hassan leaves, is she required to notify Senate President Morse? The Constitution doesn’t directly spell it out. Williams says it’s good practice, for the safety of the state. ""It’s important for Gov. Hassan to inform Senate President Morse when she is out of state. If she doesn't, he has no way to know he is acting governor (and) that would put the state at risk,"" Williams said. Still, good practice is not the same thing as a requirement. This is not a new issue; it has come up in state politics from time to time. The state attorney general’s office has rendered opinions on whether the governor is required to notify the senate president of an absence. ""While there are instances when notice has been formerly given in the past, it is not mandated by the Constitution, which is wholly silent on the issue,"" wrote Attorney General Stephen Merrill in 1987. However, Merrill noted, the intention of the Constitution was to have an automatic transfer of powers. ""Since the executive power must be kept functioning at all times, there can be no possibility of the gap which would occur while the Senate President awaits a notice from the governor,"" Merrill wrote. And Merrill added, ""There appears to have been a custom in New Hampshire for a Governor to provide notice if he is to be absent or disabled for some significant period of time."" Over the years, governors and senate presidents have worked out their own notification processes, and they vary widely. When Sen. Sylvia Larsen, a Concord Democrat, was Senate President between 2006 to 2010 then-Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, didn’t tell her when he was leaving, she said. ""In my four years (as Senate President) I don’t ever recall ever being notified,"" said Larsen, who did not seek reelection last year. ""If I learned about it, it was just because we were friends."" That wasn’t the case with Larsen’s successor, Peter Bragdon, a Milford Republican who was Senate President between 2010 and 2013, overlapping with both Lynch and Hassan’s terms. Lynch and Bragdon worked out an informal system, Bragdon said. Lynch’s chief of staff would notify Bragdon’s office when the governor would be out of state. It was the same when Hassan took over, he said. ""It was pretty much a courtesy,"" said Bragdon, who is now executive director of Health Trust Inc., which was formerly part of the Local Government Center. Hassan’s office recently released documents showing that her chief of staff, Pam Walsh, emailed Morse’s chief of staff, Kristy Merill, on the morning of Thursday, Feb 19, 2015, to tell her Hassan would be out of state that evening through Monday. That was when Hassan went to Washington D.C. to attend the National Governors Association winter meeting. ""She will be reachable by cell and email during the trip,"" Walsh wrote. Walsh again emailed on Feb. 27, to say Hassan would be out of the state until the morning of March 3 as she traveled to New York and Washington D.C. We’ll note that none of the governor’s powers were transferred to Morse during any of Hassan’s absences, according to the governor’s office. Our ruling New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn said Gov. Maggie Hassan ""must inform the Senate president about his or her absence from the state.""   While according to the state Constitution the governor’s powers are passed onto the Senate president during certain gubernatorial absences, the Constitution does not specifically require notification. It has been a frequent practice for governors to notify the Senate president of their absence from the state (as Hassan has been doing by email) but this policy hasn’t been followed in every case. We rate her statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972B7400>],/factchecks/2015/mar/05/jennifer-horn/nh-republican-party-says-governor-required-notify-/
