No, a doctor was not murdered after criticizing the Clinton Foundation
","After a New York City surgeon was found dead at his Park Avenue apartment in late 2017, some media drew a connection between his apparent suicide and a lawsuit brought against him by a former New York Giants running back. Police investigated the death of Dean Lorich as a suicide, news reports from the ABC News and the New York Daily News stated at the time. The medical examiner determined that Lorich’s death was a suicide, a fact that the New York Police Department confirmed for us again on Friday. But another website, Intellihub, published a Dec. 12, 2017 story suggesting something more nefarious—that Lorich was murdered after exposing corruption involving the Clinton Foundation in Haiti. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It appears to be making the social media rounds nearly a year after publication, with CrowdTangle data showing it has  been shared on Facebook nearly 80,000 times, generating almost 373,000 social media interactions. ""A well-known surgeon who exposed major inadequacies in medical trauma care promised to the Haitian people by the Clinton Foundation after the nonprofit raised over $30 million dollars in donations following the devastating 2010 earthquake was found dead in his upscale apartment Sunday with a stab wound to the chest,"" begins the Intellihub.com story written by Shepard Ambellas and labeled as an ""opinion"" piece. Intellihub’s website describes Ambellas as ""an opinion journalist, analyst, and the founder and editor-in-chief of Intellihub News & Politics."" Ambellas is also, according to the site, a regular contributor to Alex Jones’ InfoWars.com, a website known to traffic in fake news and conspiracy theories. Ambellas goes on in the story to report that Lorich was working with a team of doctors in Haiti when he ""discovered an almost non-existent medical effort backed by the Clinton Foundation."" When he was stateside again, the story says, Lorich aired his grievances in an email that was eventually forwarded to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A note at the end of the article asks readers who they think murdered the doctor. ""Did the doctor’s persistence wind up getting him added to the Clinton body count?"" the website says. ""Please comment and share."" According to Intellihub’s website, it is an ""independent news outlet which covers a variety of topics such as politics, the economy, surveillance, liberal corporate media bias, and much more."" Ambellas did not immediately respond to an email seeking more information about the article. An email sent to an address at the bottom of the Intellihub website also went unanswered. The story links to three outside sources. The first is a New York Post article about the surgeon’s death and the lawsuit he was facing. It doesn’t mention the Clintons or Haiti. The second is a WikiLeaks page that appears to show an email Lorich wrote in 2010 that was eventually forwarded to Hillary Clinton. By the time it reached the the-secretary of state, the subject line was: ""DOCTORS REPORT FROM HAITI."" ""Depressing,"" wrote the aide who forwarded it. In the email, Lorich describes a trip to Haiti with other doctors to provide trauma care in the wake of a devastating earthquake there. When they arrived, they were discouraged to discover that ""disaster management on the ground was nonexistent,"" according to the email. ""The difficulties in getting in despite the intelligence we had from people on the ground and David Helfet’s high political connections with Partner’s in Health as well as the Clintons only portended the difficulties we would have once we arrived."" The email does not mention the Clintons nor the Clinton Foundation again. The third link is the CNN piece authored by Lorich and surgeons Soumitra Eachempati and David Helfet. ""Doctors: Haiti medical situation shameful,"" the headline reads. They describe their plan to help safely amputate the limbs of injured earthquake victims with a 13-member team of surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses. ""We thought our plan was a good one, but we soon learned we were incredibly naive,"" the CNN opinion piece says. ""Disaster management in Haiti was nonexistent. The difficulties getting in—despite the intelligence we had from people on the ground and Dr. Helfet’s connections with Partners in Health and Bill and Hillary Clinton—only hinted at the difficulties we would have once we arrived."" Lorich and the surgeons wrote of numerous points of failure in the operation before finally taking aim at the United States, writing, ""The lack of support for our operation by the United States is shocking and embarrassing and shows how woefully unprepared we are for the realities of disasters."" There is no further elaboration of the involvement of the Clintons or the Clinton Foundation. As other fact-checkers have noted, the Clintons played a role in Haiti recovery efforts. Hillary Clinton led the U.S. government’s response to the disaster, Bill Clinton was the United Nations special envoy to Haiti and their foundation raised millions for relief projects. The couple faced allegations that their efforts didn’t accomplish enough and that some of the projects they backed benefited foreign investors and the wealthy more than poor Haitians.   Lorich’s criticism was aimed at the United States, not the Clinton Foundation, but conspiracy theories that the Clintons kill their political enemies aren’t new. And Intellihub isn’t alone in promoting the idea that the doctor’s death was retribution. But while these stories lean on some factual information—Lorich traveled to Haiti and he was discovered with a chest wound—there is no evidence that suggests he was murdered by the Clinton family.

"['Education', 'North Carolina', 'Dan McCready']","
Does this GOP candidate actually want to ‘abolish’ the Department of Education?
","In the closing statement of a debate Wednesday night, Democratic congressional candidate Dan McCready slammed Republican Mark Harris for his stance on education, repeating a favorite line of attack. ""Mark Harris has said he would abolish the Department of Education,"" said McCready, a former Marine who is running for the seat held by Republican Rep. Robert Pittenger in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, which stretches from south Charlotte east to include Lumberton and up the Interstate 95 corridor to Fayetteville. McCready made similar versions of the same claim earlier in the night and also during an Oct. 10 debate, when he said Harris, a former pastor, was ""on the record saying he would abolish the Department of Education."" We wondered if Harris, who defeated Pittenger in the Republican primary, actually said he would eliminate the cabinet-level Education Department, which has been around since 1979. Since McCready has repeated this claim many times, we decided to check it out for ourselves. Our finding? The statement is true, and Harris isn’t denying it. We did Google and Nexis searches and discovered two reports from The Charlotte Observer that said Harris had suggested he would like to eliminate the Department of Education. The reports cited a Republican primary debate from April 22, 2014, when Harris was running for a U.S. Senate seat held at the time by Democrat Kay Hagan. At the end of the debate, the moderator opened the floor for questions from voters in the audience. The first question asked the candidates which federal department they would ""actively campaign to eliminate"" and why they believed that department deserved to be eliminated. Sen. Thom Tillis, then a state representative who ultimately won the GOP nomination and later the general election, answered first. ""I think, going back to Common Core, I’d start looking at the Department of Education,"" he said. ""We existed for more than a century without one."" Tillis explained that he believed bureaucrats in the department were overpaid and were restricting teachers with unnecessary rules and regulations. Harris, who answered next, said he agreed with Tillis and added that he would also consider cutting the energy and commerce departments. He said: ""Yeah, I would really say and agree with Thom that the fact that the Department of Education, as I mentioned earlier, has certainly demonstrated such an overreach and really is something that needs — education belongs in our state and our local communities, and so I think that that’s an area. But I’ll also add to that that I think when you look at the Department of Energy, when you look at the Department of Commerce, again I think that we’ve seen so many regulations that keep stopping and holding back the job creators here in our nation, that those would be departments I would be interested in seeing."" Clearly, Harris was on board with Tillis’s suggestion that the Education Department should be eliminated, even if he also included the Energy and Commerce Departments in his response. Aaron Simpson, communications manager for the McCready campaign, pointed to the Charlotte Observer’s coverage of that debate as evidence in support of McCready’s claim. Simpson also noted that Harris did not refute the claim during the Oct. 10 debate. Instead, Harris countered that the department had overstepped its authority and that its responsibilities would be better left to the states. ""I have clearly stated that the Department of Education has lost its purpose and its way from when it was founded,"" Harris said. ""It has become a larger agency. It has become an animal that is eating money."" Later during that debate, after McCready repeated the same claim, Harris lamented that his opponent ""continues to go back and reiterate about the Department of Education."" ""Again, I will make clear, the Department of Education has gotten to a place where they are holding our money back if you do not go along with Common Core and other pieces on education that do not fit with what the citizens of North Carolina have wanted,"" Harris said. ""Local control, state control of education has always been the best answer,"" he added. Andy Yates, a spokesman for the Harris campaign, said Harris still stands by his belief. ""Mark is passionate that education is a state and local issue and that we need to keep the federal government out of our classrooms and out of our education,"" Yates said. McCready said, ""Mark Harris has said he would abolish the Department of Education."" In 2014, during a GOP primary debate for the U.S. Senate, Harris said he thought there were enough problems with the Education Department to get rid of it. His statements since then have supported that position. We rate McCready’s statement True.

Did Beto O'Rourke vote for $10 tax on a barrel of oil?
","During their second televised debate, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz said that U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke voted in favor of a $10 tax on each barrel of oil. The comment was among many heated remarks the two exchanged three weeks before the midterm elections. 
About 11 minutes into the debate, WFAA-TV reporter Jason Whitely asked Cruz, R-Texas, about climate change. Whitely said Cruz is ""clearly on record for years saying there's no evidence"" to support the concept of human-caused climate change. Whitely noted that ExxonMobil says ""the risk of climate change is clear and warrants action."" He asked Cruz, ""So, what do you tell Texas companies who think this really is a problem?"" 
Cruz replied, ""Of course the climate is changing. ""The climate has been changing from the dawn of time. The climate will change as long as we have a planet Earth. I am the son of two mathematicians and computer programmers. I believe in science."" Cruz ended his answer by saying Democrats are using climate change as a way to expand government power and control.

""That has led, for example, Congressman O'Rourke to cast some votes that I think are really harmful to the people of Texas,"" Cruz said. ""For example, Congressman O'Rourke voted in favor of a $10 a barrel tax on every barrel of oil produced in the state of Texas. That would have been absolutely devastating to the state of Texas."" 
O'Rourke denied the claim. 
""This is what you can expect over the course of this debate,"" O’Rourke said. ""Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you. He's going to make up positions and votes that I've never held or have ever taken. He's dishonest. That's why the president called him ‘Lyin’ Ted’, and it's why the nickname stuck, because it's true."" We tracked Cruz’s claim back to 2016, when President Barack Obama proposed ""more than $300 billion worth of investments over the next decade in mass transit, high-speed rail, self-driving cars, and other transportation approaches designed to reduce carbon emissions and congestion"" and a $10 tax to support its funding, according to Politico. Republicans in Congress introduced a resolution condemning the proposal. Cruz’s campaign pointed to the language of that resolution to support the senator’s claim and later shared a link to an October 9, 2018,  article from The Dallas Morning News about the claim. The Dallas Morning News article fact-checked O’Rourke’s and Cruz’s positions but didn’t say who was correct. The resolution states that ""Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That Congress finds that — (1) any new tax placed on the struggling oil and gas industry will further prevent growth and development throughout the sector and encourage additional layoffs; and (2) the effect of a $10 tax on each barrel of oil sold in the United States — (A) would raise the price of oil, and by extension gasoline; and (B) would result in a decrease in the consumption of oil."" The document concludes with the sense of Congress, which was ""(1) a new tax should not be placed on oil, and 2) in considering future policy, Congress should carefully review the detrimental impacts of placing any new taxes on any industry that has seen a slash in jobs, revenue, and production."" That language is verbatim what House Concurrent Resolution 112 states. On the House floor, Republicans said funding should come from specific user fees and not a gas tax, that Obama's proposal would increase the cost of living for Americans and instead of talking about climate change, Congress should focus on improving economic conditions in the country, according to a list of actions compiled by C-SPAN. Democrats defended the proposal as a way to fight climate change and invest in infrastructure, and at least a solution on the table that can move the discussion forward. Democrats also criticized Republicans for not wanting to tackle climate change. O’Rourke voted against the resolution, but it passed mostly with Republican support. Cruz never got the chance to vote on it, though, because after it passed out of the House, the Senate received the resolution on June 13, 2016, referred it to the Senate Finance Committee and took no further action, according to Congress’ online bill tracker. Obama backed away from the plan and didn’t include it in his budget proposal. Congress’ online glossary defines a concurrent resolution as a ""form of legislative measure used for the regulation of business within both chambers of Congress, not for proposing changes in law"" and doesn’t require the president’s signature. In other words, the resolution condemning the oil barrel tax would not have had the force of law. We asked O’Rourke campaign spokesman Chris Evans for an explanation of the congressman’s vote. Evans said O’Rourke didn’t vote in favor of a tax and pointed to the same Dallas Morning News article Cruz’s team referenced. ""As (The Dallas Morning News) points out, ’Legislation to enact a federal per-barrel oil tax hasn't even come up for a vote in the House since O'Rourke was elected in 2012,’"" he said in an October 17, 2018, email. ""Similarly, legislation that would enact a $10 a barrel tax on Texas produced oil has not come before Congress."" Evans added that ""the resolution in question was not a vote on imposing such a tax, much less did it mention anything about oil produced in Texas."" ""Beto voted against a non-binding resolution that voiced opposition to a proposal by President Obama to fund infrastructure investments,"" he said. ""The proposal itself was never voted on. But put another way, had the resolution Senator Cruz names failed to pass the House, it still would not have enacted such a tax. There was no outcome from that resolution that would have imposed ‘a $10 a barrel tax on every barrel of oil produced in the state of Texas.’ Because, as I mentioned earlier, legislation to do that has not come before Congress."" Our ruling: Cruz said O’Rourke voted in favor of a $10 tax on every barrel of oil. O'Rourke didn't vote in favor of a $10 tax. He voted against condemning a proposal to do that, one that wasn't even up for consideration in his chamber or the Senate. Also, despite Cruz’s suggestion, nothing about the proposal was directed specifically at Texas.   Cruz’s claim thus has an element of truth but is otherwise off the mark. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/oct/19/ted-cruz/did-beto-orourke-vote-10-tax-barrel-oil/

Did Nevada's Dean Heller break his promise to protect expanded Medicaid?
","Democrats have been dogging Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller ever since he sided with his party on a couple of key health care votes last year. The latest attack comes from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in an ad airing statewide in heavy rotation. In it, young Army veteran Kyle Rhodes tells his story. ""I served in Iraq, but when I got home, I couldn’t afford health insurance,"" Rhodes says. ""I finally got it when they expanded Medicaid. That helped a lot of us. ""I believed Dean Heller when he promised to protect our health care, but Dean Heller broke that promise."" Rhodes ends with these uncompromising words: ""Dean Heller, you voted against us. Now it’s our turn to vote against you."" Medicaid expansion covered nearly 9,000 veterans in Nevada in 2015, so the story Rhodes tells is not unique to him. Heller’s moves during the Senate’s push to repeal and replace Obamacare in 2017 play a prominent role in the Nevada Senate race. The charge that he broke a promise shows up repeatedly in Democratic ads. In this fact-check, we look at what Heller said and did between June and September of 2017. By June 22, 2017, the House had passed the American Health Care Act and the Senate had a draft of its replacement for Obamacare, the Better Care Reconciliation Act. The next day, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval and Heller held a joint news conference to protest the Senate bill. Heller said the Affordable Care Act had many problems, but ""this bill is simply not the answer."" ""I’m announcing today that in this form, I will not support it,"" Heller said, waving a copy of the 167-page draft. ""Our first vote on this piece of legislation may be as early as Tuesday. We'll have a procedural motion, that we don't need to get into, but it's called getting on a bill so that we can have a final vote sometime on Friday. I'm just telling you this, if this is the bill, if this is the language on that procedural motion on Tuesday, I won't be voting for it."" Tuck that away: Heller said he wouldn’t even vote on the procedural motion for the bill ""as written."" Which brings us to the biggest problem in that version of the bill for both Heller and Sandoval –– Medicaid. Heller vowed to protect expanded Medicaid. Here’s what he said: ""If you want my support on legislation on health care that fixes the state of Nevada, that supports these people that are on expanded Medicaid, you’ve got to make sure that the Republican governors that have expanded this Medicaid sign off on it. The question is, what are the changes in here and what are the assurances that they will have insurance in the future. And I’m telling you right now, it doesn’t do that. It doesn’t protect Nevadans on Medicaid and the most vulnerable Nevadans."" Under the Affordable Care Act, states got the option to extend Medicaid to any adult earning up to 138 percent of federal poverty. Nevada was one of 16 states with Republican governors that took Washington’s offer. The terms were better than for traditional Medicaid. Instead of Washington covering a little more than half of the cost (the average in 2012 was 57 percent), Washington promised to cover 90 percent of the tab for Medicaid expansion recipients over the long haul. The Senate plan changed that. It phased out the enhanced federal matching funds for the Medicaid expansion group and set a limit on federal funding through a per capita cap or, optionally, through a block grant for some enrollees. For Nevada, those changes meant an estimated loss of $4.2 billion over 10 years. The procedural vote that Heller expected quickly didn’t come for a month. In between, lawmakers tweaked the bill, but never fundamentally changed the funding rules for expanded Medicaid. Sandoval became a barometer of how well the Senate bill treated Medicaid. He never liked what he saw. Throughout the process, Sandoval remained opposed, saying he had ""great concern"" for what the legislation –– in all of its versions –– would do. After that news conference with Sandoval, Heller was in the crosshairs of everyone who wanted to get a bill through the Senate. Heller found himself on the receiving end of attack ads from a Trump-aligned super PAC America First Policies. Heller was invited to the White House where he was seated next to President Donald Trump. Trump pointed to Heller and said ""This is the one we were worried about. You weren’t there (on the bill.) But you’re going to be."" Trump turned to the rest of the room and added, ""Look, he wants to remain a senator, doesn’t he?"" On July 25, Heller voted with 49 other Republicans to move the bill forward in the Senate. It was the procedural vote he had said he wouldn’t approve. Heller spokeswoman Megan Taylor said by that time, the measure had changed and he saw that vote as the best way to improve the bill. ""After it was clear that the bill was being modified and there would be an open debate and votes on amendments to the Senate’s bill, Sen. Heller voted to debate health care because he thought that ideas to improve our failing health care system should be discussed,"" Taylor said. But in terms of a threat to expanded Medicaid, the bill Heller green-lighted was largely the same as the version he rejected a month earlier. The welter of Senate votes that followed make the head spin, and through it all, Heller managed to be on both sides of the Medicaid issue. He voted against a Democratic move that would have protected benefits to anyone currently eligible for Medicaid. He voted for a motion that effectively killed the main Republican bill and its whittling away of expanded Medicaid. Heller offered a non-binding amendment that urged Senate members in a hoped-for conference committee to protect Medicaid expansion. The amendment also called for repeal of the Affordable Care Act and lost by a wide margin. He voted against the full repeal of Obamacare, which would have washed away everything, including expanded Medicaid. Few people followed the twists and turns more than Timothy Jost, professor emeritus at Washington and Lee University School of Law. Jost told us Heller’s record was decidedly mixed. ""He voted with the Republicans a number of times to proceed and on motions that kept the bill alive,"" Jost said. ""But he did vote against two bills that would have killed Medicaid expansion."" Jost said he sees evidence for both sides of the argument on where Heller stood. In the end, the Senate plan crumbled. In a dramatic 1 a.m. vote, every Democrat and three Republican senators, including most notably John McCain, voted against it and the bill died. That version was stripped down and said nothing about Medicaid. Heller joined most Republicans and voted for it. In September, Heller joined a last-ditch push to pass a new health care law. He co-sponsored the Graham-Cassidy bill. That would have replaced expanded Medicaid with block grants to the states. It shifted traditional Medicaid funding from an open-ended commitment to a capped amount. Nevada would have the flexibility to use its block-grant money however it saw best to help subsidize health insurance premiums, create high-risk pools for those with pre-existing conditions or take other steps as necessary to make health insurance affordable and available. The impact on the people benefiting from Medicaid expansion was unclear, but the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that overall, Nevada would lose about 8 percent or $870 million by 2026. Sandoval joined nine other governors to oppose Graham-Cassidy. The plan never came up for a vote. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said Heller broke his promise to protect expanded Medicaid. Heller said he would vote no on a procedural vote, and said any bill must pass muster with Republican governors in states with expanded Medicaid. His follow-up votes were mixed. Heller voted yes on the procedural vote. While the bill differed from the original draft, it had no significant differences on Medicaid expansion. Immediately after that, Heller both voted no on a move that explicitly protected expanded Medicaid and voted no on two bills that would have killed expanded Medicaid. Heller co-sponsored the Graham-Cassidy bill, which did not specifically curtail Medicaid expansion but reduced funds going to Nevada and created uncertainty about the program’s future. He had said he would not support health care changes that did not win Gov. Sandoval’s support, but Sandoval opposed Graham-Cassidy. His record can make the case either way.

Cuomo attacks Molinaro's record on shackling pregnant inmates
","Gov. Andrew Cuomo is keeping up the attacks on his Republican opponent, Marc Molinaro, as he campaigns for a third term. His latest ad, running online and also airing on television, focuses on issues important to women and criticizes Molinaro for opposing equal pay, abortion rights and taking guns away from domestic abusers among other positions. But one claim stood out. Cuomo says Molinaro ""supports putting a female inmate in shackles during childbirth."" Where did that come from, and is it true? The Assembly bill

As an Assembly member in 2009, Molinaro voted against a bill to prohibit the use of shackles and restraints on pregnant inmates who are in labor. In support of the ""anti-shackling bill,"" women who had been incarcerated in New York State described how they were subject to the use of waist chains, handcuffs, and shackles, while they were in labor.  Health care organizations called the restraints harmful to women and their babies. ""Physically restraining a pregnant prisoner poses undue stress on both her and her baby, is uncomfortable and possibly could interfere with proper assessment of the patient's condition,"" the Medical Society of the State of New York wrote in a letter supporting the bill. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists called for an end to the practice before the legislation. By 2009, at least four other states had enacted prohibitions on restraining inmates during delivery. Groups opposed to the bill included the New York State Association of Counties, which said it takes away discretion of local sheriffs and medical personnel. It could add expenses to local budgets, the association said. The New York State Sheriff’s Association also opposed the measure. The bill, S.1290-A/A.3373-A, won wide support, passing 61-0 in the Senate and 119-21 in the Assembly. The law restricts the use of restraints when pregnant inmates in labor are transported to a hospital and during delivery and recovery. During transport to a medical facility before labor, and only under ""extraordinary circumstances,"" the law allows corrections staff to handcuff them by one wrist if the women are a danger to themselves or to medical or corrections personnel. No restraints may be used during labor or during recovery. The law calls for corrections personnel to stay with the woman during her hospital stay to keep her in custody. The law applies to state correctional facilities and local jails. Between 60 and 70 state prison inmates were pregnant in 2007 and 2008, according to Sen. Velmanette Montgomery, a bill sponsor.

Molinaro's regret

Molinaro said recently that he would not vote the same way today - not because he changed his mind about the substance of the bill, but because of politics. He said he voted against the 2009 bill because of concerns raised by physicians and corrections officers about women acting violently against themselves and their newborns, according to an article in the Poughkeepsie Journal. ""The way the bill was written, there was no discretion,"" Molinaro told the newspaper’s editorial board. ""It made a very black-and-white statement that could put women and children at risk."" Molinaro explained his regret to the editorial board. ""I regret that vote only in that I had to deal with it politically,"" he said. ""The only reason I regret that vote is that you can spin it the way you wish."" We asked the Molinaro campaign whether he had anything to add and if there is any context we should consider when evaluating Cuomo’s claim about Molinaro’s vote. Campaign spokeswoman Katherine Delgado provided a memo written by then-Gov. David Paterson when he signed the bill into law. Paterson acknowledged some people were concerned the law would be interpreted to apply to any pregnant woman being transported for any reason. Paterson wrote that he did not share that concern. The Molinaro campaign also drew attention to Paterson’s statement that he would prefer a bill that would allow corrections personnel to use discretion about whether to use a restraint if the inmate posed a risk to the public or could escape. Paterson decided not to veto the bill because inmates who are a danger to the public would also likely be a danger to themselves or medical or corrections personnel, as specified in the law. Inmates thinking about trying to escape would be deterred by the presence of a correctional officer, he said. In a video interview with USA TODAY Network, Molinaro pushed back on the use of the term ""shackle"" when describing restrained inmates. He was not directly asked about that vote. But speaking generally about votes that have come under scrutiny during the campaign, Molinaro said he has evolved.   ""If we want to be held and defined only by slices of our lives, we’ll get nowhere,"" he said. Our ruling Cuomo said Molinaro ""supports putting a female inmate in shackles during childbirth."" Molinaro was one of 21 Assembly members to vote against a bill that would prohibit the use of restraints on pregnant inmates held in local jails and state prisons during childbirth.

Florida PAC levels scary and misleading claim about Tallahassee's murder rate under Andrew Gillum
","Set to the creepy voice of Gollum from The Lord of the Rings, a Facebook video blames Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum for a murder spike in his city. ""Andrew Gillum,"" says the narrator of the video, produced by the conservative Florida Strong PAC. ""He is a failed mayor ..."" The ad then levels a series of charges about his record, including that he ""oversaw a 52 percent increase in murder."" (Yes, the PAC was having some fun with the fact that Gillum’s name is similar to Gollum while bringing up violent crime.) Gillum and Republican Ron DeSantis have been arguing over the city’s record on crime for months. Did Gillum oversee a 52 percent increase in city murders? There's a way to get to that number, but it isn't very honest. The PAC cherry-picked data that made the city sound like a growing hotbed for murder. In reality, the number of murders during Gillum’s tenure as mayor has swung little, ranging from 11 to 17 deaths in four years. Further, the ad goes too far to pin the responsibility on Gillum. Tallahassee has a weak mayor form of government, which means Gillum is just one vote on the commission. Florida Strong PAC chairman Stafford Jones told PolitiFact that he gleaned the information about the city’s murder rate from a Republican Party of Florida Facebook post. The party drew data from Tallahassee Reports, a website critical of city government run by former city commission candidate Steve Stewart. Tallahassee Reports looked at data reported by the city’s police department to the state for the annual FBI reports. The data covers Gillum’s political tenure; he was elected to the city commission in 2003 and became mayor in late 2014. The website found that from 2002 to 2009 the average murder rate per 100,000 citizens in Tallahassee was 4.6. Then, from 2010 to 2017, the average murder rate increased to 7 murders per 100,000 citizens. The increase equals 52 percent. But if we look at the sheer number of murders we see that the number of murders ranges from a low of four deaths in 2003 to a high of 17 in 2017. If we look just at Gillum's mayoral tenure, the range was between 11 and 17 murders. We sent the Tallahassee Reports data to Brian Stults, a criminologist at Florida State University. ""There is nothing wrong with the math, nor anything inherently wrong with the approach,"" he said. ""It just cherry-picks a single number that happens to be the most volatile in most places."" He said small numbers must be viewed with caution and that it requires taking a broader look at trends. ""In both periods, the risk of being murdered is very, very low,"" Stults said. ""Small random fluctuations from year to year can lead to dramatic changes in the murder rate that are not as substantial as they may seem."" Stults created his own spreadsheet using FDLE data showing crime and crime rate data in Tallahassee. He, too, found spikes in the murder rate, though he noted that the size of the increase depended upon the methodology used. DeSantis has cited an even higher figure when he tweeted that ""the murder rate increased 83 percent.""  That’s a reference to an increase in murders in Leon County from 12 in 2016 to 22 in 2017. Several criminology experts said that the data about the murder rate in isolation doesn’t tell us much about murders, or more broadly, crime about the city. Experts also generally warn against blaming a mayor for the crime rate (or the inverse, giving a mayor credit for a drop in crime). Crime is influenced by local characteristics beyond a mayor’s control, such as poverty rates and the concentration of the youth population. A murder rate alone doesn’t account for shifts in the demographic makeup of the population that may affect the murder rate, said Florida State University criminologist William D. Bales. ""Blaming changes in the murder rate, or any other type of crime, over time in a community on one single person is fallacious,"" he said. The number of murders alone doesn’t tell us anything about how many suspects murdered strangers compared to acquaintances or people they know well, University of Florida professor Jodi Lane said. Generally, people are more likely to be killed by someone they know, which is much more difficult for a politician to affect. Stults said that that while citizens are often quite concerned about the murder rate since it is such a serious form of victimization, the likelihood of being murdered in Tallahassee is extremely low. A video by Florida Strong says Gillum ""oversaw a 52 percent increase in murder."" This attack is hollow. The attack stems from data showing that the murder rate increased from 4.6 per 100,000 residents between 2002-09 — when Gillum was on the city commission — to 7 per 100,000 residents between 2010-17, when Gillum was on the commission and then became mayor. The math works out to 52 percent. Highlighting this number with no context is a scare tactic. The annual numbers of murders are small, where any increase can lead to a large rate spike. By stating that Gillum ""oversaw"" that murder increase suggests that he is to blame when in fact he is one of a handful of votes on the commission. Crime is influenced by factors beyond a mayor’s control. We rate this statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/oct/19/florida-strong/florida-pac-video-wrongly-blames-andrew-gillum-tal/

No, the House GOP super PAC isn't spending the most in Kansas 2nd, but they are spending a lot
","As we close in on the last month before the midterms, the ad wars continue to escalate. Political groups are pouring money into congressional districts to make their candidates look good, or more often, opposing candidates to look bad. It is going on all over the country, but Paul Davis’ campaign claims that an outside GOP PAC is spending the most in Kansas’ 2nd Congressional District. In a recent tweet, Davis, the Democrat running for the seat that includes Topeka, Lawrence and communities west of Kansas City, said that ""the House GOP super PAC in DC is spending more to help my opponent than anyone else."" It is true that the Congressional Leadership Fund - the leading GOP super PAC affiliated with House Republican leadership - is pouring money into the district, but the Davis campaign is exaggerating. Davis is one of the top targets of the super PAC, but he's not No. 1.  Here, we look at just how much is being funneled into the district from CLF and how it measures up to other House races around the country. The Davis campaign told us the claim is based off a CNN report released in late September. In the report, CNN examined the top districts where the Congressional Leadership Fund was spending its money on ad buys. It found that, as of Sept. 21 (when the report was published), CLF had poured $1.9 million into the district, nabbing the top spot on its list. Colorado’s 6th Congressional District and California’s 48th followed with $1.6 million and $1.5 million spent by CLF. Most of the television advertising were attacks on Democrats. This is definitely visible in KS-2. In September alone, the PAC aired four attack ads against Davis. We checked the OpenSecrets.org database, a widely cited campaign finance tracking resource published by the Center for Responsive Politics. Interestingly, the database shows that so far in the race, CLF has spent more than $3.2 million, nearly double CNN’s estimate, but still doesn’t list the district as the top one for the group's spending. Besides more than $6 million spent attacking Jon Ossoff, who lost to Republican U.S. Rep. Karen Handel in a 2017 special election, the top Democrat CLF is spending against is Democrat Joe Radinovich, who is running against Republican candidate Pete Stauber in Minnesota's 8th District. So far, CLF has spent nearly $3.9 million against him. But while Davis isn't the top Democrat that CLF is spending money against (he comes in at No. 7), the KS-2 race overall takes 4th place when factoring in the money the super PAC has spent in support of Watkins.   Races CLF $ Against  Democrats CLF $ For  Republicans Total $ Spent 1. California 39th $3,839,570 $94,442 $3,934,012 2. Minnesota 8th $3,893,273 $8,660 $3,901,933 3. California 25th $2,880,372 $584,715 $3,465,087 4. Kansas 2nd $2,937,462 $390,063 $3,327,525 5.

Minnesota 3rd $2,664,035 $63,944 $2,727,979 The Davis campaign says that the House GOP super PAC is spending more to help out Watkins than anyone else. The Republican Super PAC is airing a torrent of attack ads against Davis and spending a lot of money in the district. But records show that Davis is not the top taget for CLF, though the district is listed among the top 5. Still, that doesn’t make Watkins the top recipient of such efforts.

Danny O'Connor wouldn't — and can't — make Columbus, Ohio, a sanctuary city
","""Sanctuary city"" is a term that typically applies when local police won’t cooperate with federal authorities if someone in their custody is suspected of immigration violations. This is a flash point in the national debate over borders and immigration. It’s also apparently a flash point for Republicans in the 2018 Ohio Congressional District 12 election. A new ad from Republican U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson says his opponent, Danny O’Connor, supports progressive values such as sanctuary cities. A Balderson ad in early October said it more directly:  O’Connor ""supports making Columbus a sanctuary city."" And a recent ad from a group called Defending Main Street, a PAC affiliated with the Republican Main Street Partnership, says the same thing: O’Connor ""would make Columbus a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants."" Would he? Could he? And what’s the proof? The proof, Defending Main Street says, is a tweet from O’Connor in support of a policy from the mayor of Columbus. The tweet said nothing specifically about sanctuary cities. Yet it touched on an issue awfully close, and raised a good question: Does O’Connor really want to make Ohio’s capital city a sanctuary city? Soon after taking office in 2017, President Donald Trump issued a travel ban barring immigrants from certain Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. He said they posed a national security risk. In turn, Columbus Mayor Andrew J. Ginther issued an executive order on Feb. 3, 2017, for his city. It said that the city supports refugees and will help place or settle those ""eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees."" Note the language: ""eligible to be admitted."" The mayor's order also said the city would not use its resources ""for the sole purpose of detecting or apprehending persons based on suspected immigration status, unless in response to a court order."" This meant the city was not going to stop or pull people over just to check on their immigration status. Yet as refugee-friendly as this sounds, the mayor's executive order made an important legal distinction: The city would not investigate or cooperate in an investigation ""unless a warrant exists, a criminal violation was reported, or an arrest was made."" Some cities refuse to do even that -- and those are the very cities the White House defines as sanctuary cities. Ginther announced his intentions to issue this order a few days earlier, with a Jan. 30 news release. The mayor that day wrote a tweet as well: ""This week I will issue an executive order that will support the resettlement of refugees in Columbus."" The tweet was about supporting resettlement -- legal resettlement, as the executive order made clear. The mayor's tweet said nothing about refusing to cooperate with federal authorities when police have arrested someone -- which the mayor was not saying, anyway. The mayor's tweet on supporting resettlement prompted O’Connor to send a tweet of his own to his followers. It retweeted Ginther’s words and added, ""Proud of my friend and Mayor @andrewginter for his leadership in pushing back against Trump. We are all immigrants!"" O’Connor made no mention of sanctuary cities in his tweet. Defending Main Street says that the mayor's announcement closely mirrors sanctuary city laws and O'Connor's tweet was an endorsement.   But it wasn't a clear endorsement of sanctuary city policy. Some definitions are helpful here. The White House website says the term sanctuary city ""generally refers to jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with lawful federal immigration enforcement efforts, often by rejecting immigration ‘detainer’ requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement."" Here is how this works, the White House says: When local police arrest ""an illegal alien on criminal charges, ICE issues a detainer, which is a request that the local authority notify ICE before releasing the alien and maintain custody for a short time so that ICE may take custody for removal purposes. Sanctuary jurisdictions, including many big cities, refuse to comply with ICE’s detainer requests."" Columbus has never declared itself a sanctuary city. It said it wecomes immigrants, but it never said it wouldn’t cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Rather, the mayor's order said the city would do so when ""a warrant exists, a criminal violation was reported, or an arrest was made."" That is a lot different from cities that have made arrests in crimes but still refuse ICE requests to turn the individuals over for ICE custody. Those cities are more typically labeled — or declare themselves — sanctuary cities. ICE says this as well: It places ""detainers on aliens who have been arrested on local criminal charges,"" so it can determine whether it has probable cause to believe that they are removable from the United States. That phrase -- they have been arrested on local criminal charges -- is the same criterion the mayor used in his executive order. ICE adds on its website, ""When law enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release serious criminal offenders, it undermines ICE’s ability to protect public safety and carry out its mission."" The Center for Immigration Studies, which describes itself as supporting ""low immigration"" while being ""pro-immigrant,"" has an online map pinpointing sanctuary cities. None are in Ohio. That’s because the center uses ""the strictest definition possible,"" which means cities that refuse or prohibit their agencies from complying with ICE even when someone has been arrested, spokesman Matthew Sussis said. As Franklin County recorder, O’Connor has no power to make Columbus a sanctuary city. He wouldn’t if elected to Congress, either. ""O'Connor does not support sanctuary cities,"" his campaign manager, Annie Ellison, told us. As for his views on immigration, O’Connor told Vox that ""I don’t support abolishing ICE... Oversimplifying things is not going to solve our immigration problem."" In an interview with the Columbus Dispatch in early July, O’Connor said, ""What we have right now at the border with the separation of children from their families is abhorrent. If we make sure our immigration debate is focused on safety and not on penalizing folks who aren't committing crimes and are contributing economically, that's the right way to do things."" Defending Main Street says, as Troy Balderson has also said, that Danny O’Connor ""would make Columbus a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants."" O’Connor couldn’t if he wanted to, but he also has not said that. He supported policies of the Columbus mayor, who said the city would not volunteer to go after federal immigration suspects or turn them over to ICE ""unless a warrant exists, a criminal violation was reported, or an arrest was made."" That doesn’t meet the definition of a sanctuary city by ICE or groups that support lower levels of immigration.

In a Facebook post, Sean O'Brien suggests that there are allegations that Henry never uttered those words, but he dismissed them. ""There are people accusing me of this quote being fake. I can assure you, there is some evidence that Patrick Henry did say this, and if you want to call it fake, you’re really missing the actual message of it. Who said it isn’t as relevant as the message itself!!!"" The Oct. 2, 2018, post has been shared more than 43,000 times. The sentiment has also been used by politicians such as Kentucky Sen.

Readers are free to embrace the message, but to say Henry or any other famous person said something he didn't is an example of fake news. In this case, the attribution is designed to give a statement extra gravitas by attributing it to a founding father. So whether Henry said it or not is important. When we asked O'Brien for evidence that Henry was the author, he quickly responded via Facebook Messenger that the only thing he could find was a reference at goodreads.com, which does not cite a source.

Evidence that the quote is a fabrication has been around for years. In 2012, Thomas S. Kidd, distinguished professor of history at Baylor University and author of ""Patrick Henry: First Among Patriots"" said it as one of several bogus Henry quotes on the Internet. The earliest reference he could find at the time was from a pair of books published in 2003. ""Why create a bogus quotation when Henry actually said similar things about the need to restrain government?"" Kidd wrote. Since the essay, Kidd said in an email, ""I still have never seen any information that would suggest that this is a legitimate Henry quote.""    Jon Kukla, historian and author of the 2017 book ""Patrick Henry: Champion of Liberty"" and former director of Red Hill -- The Patrick Henry National Memorial in Charlotte County, Virginia, agreed via Facebook Messenger, ""Regardless of sentiment — these words are NOT Patrick Henry's.""

Fact-checking Martha McSally's position on birth control
","The Arizona Democratic Party claims that Republican U.S. Rep. Martha McSally’s stance on women’s health care is a reason why she shouldn’t be voted into the U.S. Senate. ""Martha has repeatedly tried to limit women’s access to birth control, and she even cosponsored a bill to make contraception more expensive for women,"" said a claim on marthaforsenate.com, a website paid for by the Arizona Democratic Party highlighting ""what McSally doesn't want you to know."" McSally is facing Democratic U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema in the Nov. 6 election. We wondered if McSally backed a bill to make birth control more expensive for women. Under the Affordable Care Act, most women don’t have to pay out-of-pocket for prescribed birth control. McSally supported a bill to make it easier for contraceptive drugs to be sold without a prescription — meaning insurers wouldn’t have to pay for those pills, women would. The Arizona Democratic Party is referring to the Allowing Greater Access to Safe and Effective Contraception Act, introduced January 2017 by Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah, and co-sponsored by McSally. The bill seeks to facilitate the Food and Drug Administration’s approval process for contraceptive drugs, and to make them available over-the-counter (without a prescription) for individuals 18 years old and older. (Prescriptions would be needed for women younger than 18.) The proposal also seeks to repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 to allow the use of health savings accounts and health flexible spending accounts to pay for drugs without a prescription. Under the Affordable Care Act, most women don’t pay out-of-pocket for FDA-approved birth control prescribed by a doctor. Most private health insurance plans can’t charge women a co-pay or co-insurance for covered contraceptive methods, patient education and counseling. (Exceptions apply; certain exempt religious employers don't have to provide the coverage.) The Arizona Democratic Party says that since the McSally-supported bill makes contraceptive drugs available without a prescription, insurers won’t have to pay for them. Women would cover the costs. The Democratic group also noted that McSally voted in favor of repealing the Affordable Care Act. McSally’s campaign argued that the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive coverage is ""meaningless"" for people without health insurance. ""Allowing people without health insurance to purchase over-the-counter contraceptives provides a new pathway that was not previously available and may be the only source of affordable contraceptives,"" said Torunn Sinclair, McSally’s campaign spokeswoman. If contraceptive drugs became available over-the-counter, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and states can still specify that they be covered by insurance, Sinclair added. She said the availability of over-the-counter products could also increase competition in the market and drive down prices, and save time and costs related to doctor’s visits. The bill McSally supports intends for over-the-counter birth control to complement, not substitute for prescribed contraceptives, Sinclair said. It’s not necessarily that the cost of the contraception would increase or decrease under McSally’s proposal. Rather, it is that the out-of-pocket expenses to the consumer could increase if over-the-counter pills are not covered by insurance, said Britt Wahlin, vice president for development and public affairs at Ibis Reproductive Health, an international organization seeking to expand women’s access to contraceptives. ""In essence, it is correct that over-the-counter contraception could be more expensive for a woman if it is not covered by insurance and she currently has insurance covering her pills,"" Wahlin said. Since there’s no language in the McSally-backed bill saying over-the-counter contraceptives would be covered through insurance, women could end up paying out-of-pocket if they choose over-the-counter drugs, said Usha Ranji, an associate director for Women’s Health Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""There is concern and speculation"" that the bill was introduced and backed by conservatives to undermine the Affordable Care Act coverage, said Susan F. Wood, a health policy professor and director of the Jacobs Institute of Women's Health at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. ""On the surface it appears to be expanding access,"" Wood said. ""But unless you solve the cost problem for insured people, you are in fact reducing access."" The McSally-backed proposal seeks to allow women to use health savings accounts to pay for non-prescription drugs, but that’s not how most people pay for their medication and it’s not a substitute for insurance coverage, experts said. ""(Flexible spending accounts) put the burden for covering costs entirely on the consumer and don’t have much benefit for lower income people,"" Wahlin said. Over-the-counter birth control pills can expand access to safe, effective contraception for women who are uninsured, who live far from health care facilities, or who do not have access to a clinic system — but an affordable retail price is also necessary, Wahlin said. As McSally’s campaign noted, some states have passed laws so insurers pay for over-the-counter contraceptives. But experts said that varies per state and per insurer and could still leave some women paying out-of-pocket for birth control pills. Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy nonprofit that supports women’s access to birth control, in 2015 said that a bill introduced in the Senate (similar to the one McSally supports) was ""flawed because it rests on the false assumption"" that switching a drug from prescription-only to over-the-counter ""will inevitably lower its costs."" Guttmacher said that the only available example of an over-the-counter hormonal contraceptive was emergency contraception, and that its cost remained high since the prescription requirement was removed. Some experts also say that if the Affordable Care Act’s contraception coverage is eliminated, women would end up paying for other methods that still require prescription. Even if one type of birth control pill is approved by the FDA as over-the-counter, there are other oral contraceptives that would likely remain on prescription, and there are still other forms of birth control that cannot be over-the-counter, such as IUDs (intrauterine devices), said Lucia DiVenere, a government and political affairs officer for The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The Arizona Democratic Party said, McSally ""has repeatedly tried to limit women’s access to birth control, cosponsored a bill to make contraception more expensive for women."" Under the Affordable Care Act, most women don’t have to pay for birth control if its prescribed. McSally voted to repeal the health care law. The bill McSally supports seeks to make contraceptive drugs available over-the-counter, which would increase access. But experts said that without language in the bill saying over-the-counter contraception would be covered by insurance, women could go from not paying to paying. Some states have passed laws to ensure no-cost contraceptive coverage, but that approach could leave women in some states paying out-of-pocket.

Senate Leadership Fund distorts Heidi Heitkamp's record on immigration
","An ad released by the Senate Leadership Fund in the North Dakota Senate race paints incumbent Heidi Heitkamp as two-faced when it comes to immigration. ""There are two Heidi Heitkamps. One in North Dakota, the other siding with liberals in Washington. Washington Heidi supports sanctuary cities, where illegal immigrants can be released on our streets, like this criminal, who was let go and then sexually assaulted a child. The same Heidi who is funded by Washington liberals who want to abolish ICE,"" the voiceover says. Heitkamp has voted against bills that would defund sanctuary cities, but that’s not the same as voting to protect criminals, as the ad suggests. The Senate Leadership Fund declined to provide evidence for its ad. Heitkamp’s campaign said she opposed bills to punish sanctuary cities because they end up punishing law enforcement for a political decision made by a municipality. Her campaign highlighted her vote in favor of Kate’s Law, a bill that would have increased penalties for unauthorized immigrants, and her support of Trump’s 2018 immigration proposal, which included $25 billion for border security, tougher enforcement and new limits on legal immigration. Heitkamp has called the movement to abolish ICE, ""crazy town,"" and said that criticizing law enforcement for doing their job does not ""sit well"" with her as a former attorney general. A sanctuary city can be a town, county or other jurisdiction. There isn’t a federal law defining sanctuary locations, but the term is generally applied to places that have policies or ordinances limiting the assistance that local police provide to federal immigration authorities. ""The one common theme to sanctuary areas is not that they release criminals onto the streets, but that they will not do the work that is the responsibility of the federal enforcement agencies,"" said Elizabeth Cohen, a political science professor at Syracuse University. There are no sanctuary cities in North Dakota, according to research by the Federation of American Immigration Reform, which favors reduced immigration. The Senate Leadership Fund cited four Heitkamp ""nay"" votes in the text of their ad. The bills sought to compel cities to honor ICE detainer requests on local law enforcement agencies by withholding federal grants. They gave local authorities legal immunity to do so. The idea behind limiting cooperation between local and federal authorities is to encourage crime reporting and witnesses from the immigrant community to come forward, according to Hiroshi Motomura, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. But sanctuary policies are not absolute, allowing cooperation when immigrants meet a certain threshold for criminal convictions. ""Even San Francisco policies, which are probably the most liberal in the country, require the police to cooperate when the person has a serious criminal history,"" said Huyen Pham, a law professor at Texas A&M University. So what happened in the sexual assault case the ad mentions? We tracked down the man in the mugshot through a reverse image search. He is Juan Ramon Vasquez, an undocumented immigrant who was charged with raping a 5-year-old family member following his 2014 release from a Philadelphia jail. (He previously used the name Ramon Aguirre-Ochoa.) He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to eight to 20 years in prison for the rape. President Donald Trump and other opponents of sanctuary cities have used his case as a rallying point. Vasquez was originally arrested for an unrelated aggravated assault, but was released when the prosecutors declined to pursue the charges. ICE requested that he be held for possible deportation proceedings. The city did not honor the detainer request. Philadelphia’s sanctuary city policy states that a person cannot be detained after their release unless they are convicted of a first- or second-degree felony involving violence, and that detainer is supported by a judicial warrant. There was no conviction or warrant in Vasquez’s case. The sanctuary city bills would have forced locales to honor detainers or lose federal funding for law enforcement and other programs. However, even that may not have ensured Vasquez stayed off the streets, as he would have had the chance to ask for bond in front of an immigration judge, according to Linus Chan, a law professor at the University of Minnesota. In other words, the bills Heitkamp voted against would not necessarily have prevented the case the ad calls attention to. The Senate Leadership Fund said, ""Washington Heidi supports sanctuary cities, where illegal immigrants can be released on our streets, like this criminal, who was let go and then sexually assaulted a child."" Heitkamp voted against bills that blocked law enforcement grants for sanctuary cities, because she said she didn't want to punish law enforcement agencies. She also voted in favor of other bills that ramped up immigration law enforcement. The ad suggests that Heitkamp sympathizes with abolishing ICE, when she called the idea ""crazy town."" The ad also suggests sanctuary cities allow violent criminals to roam the streets, but that's a skewed interpretation. We rate this statement Mostly False.

"['Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz said GOP tax cut led to higher revenues. Did it?
","Texas Sen. Ted Cruz touted his support for the Republican-backed tax bill in his second debate against Democratic U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke. After saying that previous tax cuts have led to increases in revenue, such as those under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, Cruz said, ""This time with that tax cut we’re seeing the result, and to date, federal tax revenues have gone up. Federal tax revenues are higher this year than they are last year without the tax cut."" (It can be seen here around the 51:00 mark.) Is that correct? If you look at the sheer number of dollars collected, irrespective of inflation and without regard to the size of the overall economy or other factors, taxes went up very slightly. Specifically, new federal data show that tax revenues rose between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018 by 0.4 percent. (Federal fiscal years run from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.) The rise is smaller than almost every previous year since World War II, except for a handful of years in which tax revenues declined, largely due to recessions. And the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that favors shrinking the federal deficit, found that the small increase in nominal dollars collected disappears once you add in other factors. If you adjust for inflation, the group found, tax revenues actually fell by 1.6 percent. (This calculation is for the first 11 months of fiscal 2018, compared to the first 11 months of 2017. The group had not calculated the data for the full year by our publication time, but the differences from adding the 12th month should be minor.) You can also look at tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product — essentially, factoring in economic growth which should, in turn, generate tax revenues. In this case, GDP growth didn’t boost tax revenues proportionately — this measure fell by 4.1 percent over the first 11 months of the fiscal year. Finally, we can look at actual tax collections relative to the expectations of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in June 2017, which was several months before the law passed. CBO’s projection of $3.531 trillion in tax collections was based on population growth, inflation, wage growth, and other factors. By this standard, tax revenue fell short of the projection by 5.7 percent.   Each of these measurements undercut Cruz’s argument that tax revenues increased. ""Tax revenues naturally grow with a growing economy,"" said Donald Marron, a fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. ""The economy has been doing well. Revenues, however, haven’t grown as much. So the tax cuts reduced revenues relative to what they would have been, just as every serious analyst predicted."" In addition, Cruz portrayed a direct relationship: The tax law was passed, and revenue went up. But that’s questionable. We can probe this question by separating out the months in which the old tax law prevailed and looking only at the months in which the new tax law was the primary factor shaping tax payments. Three months in fiscal 2018 were governed by the old law — October, November and December. Another two months — March and April — were governed by the new law, but were dominated by tax payments for income generated in 2017, and thus was predominantly shaped by the old law. A final month, September, had not produced final data by the time of our article. That leaves six months in which it was the new law that shaped tax payments to the government — January, February, May, June, July and August. And if you compare the cumulative collections for those six months in 2017 and 2018, tax collections actually declined by 3.8 percent between 2017 (when the old law was in force) and 2018 (when the new law was in force). In this chart, the drop from 2017 to 2018 is clearly visible.   Catherine Frazier, a spokesman for Cruz, emphasized that Cruz was correct about the calculation using nominal dollars, ""In fact, individual tax revenues this year are $96 billion higher than last year, even after cutting individual taxes,"" she said. Cruz said that with the Republican-backed tax cut, ""we’re seeing the result, and to date, federal tax revenues have gone up."" They have gone up by less than half of 1 percent in nominal dollars, one of the weakest increases since the end of World War II. They have actually fallen if you factor in inflation, growth in the economy, or prior projections for tax collections. Cruz’s suggestion that the new tax law caused the nominal increase is dubious, since in the months when that new law was the primary mover of tax payments, collections actually fell by 3.8 percent.

In other words, Ted Cruz has a harder time working with members across the aisle than almost anyone else to get anything done."" We wondered about the basis of O'Rourke's historical claim. O’Rourke points to ‘bipartisan index’ By email, Chris Evans of O’Rourke’s campaign told us O'Rourke based his statement on a ""bipartisan lifetime index"" calculated by the Lugar Center, which is part of Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. An October 2018 Dallas Morning News profile of Cruz cited the index and said: ""From 1993 to 2016, the only senator of either party who worked less often across the aisle was South Carolina’s Jim DeMint, a tea party godfather who recruited and promoted Cruz for the 2012 race in Texas, before moving on to run the conservative Heritage Foundation."" Next, we confirmed Cruz’s next-to-worst ranking by reviewing the center’s online post of lifetime bipartisan index scores of senators covering 1993 through 2016. Other current senators scoring poorly, per the index: Mike Lee, R-Utah; Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont; Rand Paul, R-Kentucky; Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin; and Ed Markey, D-Mass. Lowest-Scoring Senators, Bipartisan Index (1993 through 2016) Senator (by score) Rank Name State Party Congresses Score  SOURCE: Web page, ""The Lugar Center - McCourt School Bipartisan Index (1992-2016),"" the Lugar Center, McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University, undated (accessed Oct. 17, 2018) In 2017 alone, Cruz ranked 85th among senators, per the index, outpacing Republican Sens. Luther Strange and Richard Shelby, both of Alabama, as well as 11 Democrats including Sanders, the Senate’s least bipartisan member. Methodology And how is each bipartisanship score reached? According to the center, it reaches its bipartisanship scores based on tallying each senators sponsorships and co-sponsorships. ""A bipartisan sponsorship,"" the center says, ""is defined as the introduction of a bill that attracts cosponsors from the opposing party. Similarly, a bipartisan co-sponsorship is the act of a congressional member adding his or her name in support of a bill introduced by a member of the opposing party."" Next, each senator’s bipartisan co-sponsorships are divided into his or her total co-sponsorships with a similar ratio calculated for sponsorships. ""Attracting a single cosponsor from the opposing party is the most important threshold for bipartisanship,"" the center says, ""but some bills are more bipartisan than others. Bipartisan Intensity rewards members for introducing bills that receive more support from the opposing party, but with diminishing returns."" The center’s scores do not consider ceremonial bills or local legislation, such as proposals naming post offices. They also are statistically weighted and standardized for such things as political party, so as not to unfairly disadvantage scores of the current party in power. That’s because minority party members generally can’t move legislation without getting a sponsor from the party in power -- and therefore, they could appear to be more bipartisan. Finer calculations are described here. The center further says on its web page that the index ""at its core is quite simple. Members of Congress can increase their score either by actively seeking out agreeable ideas proposed by the opposite party or by drafting legislation that is likely to attract members of the other party. The Index rewards those who prioritize governance over posturing and aims to encourage members of Congress to seek areas of consensus as opposed to simply using legislation to delineate differences."" Center analyst: O'Rourke accurately recapped findings When we sought elaboration, the center’s Dan Diller noted by email that the index doesn’t judge whether individual proposals are bipartisan in themselves. ""Members succeed and fail on the index according to objective measurements of how often they cross the line to work with the other party at bill introduction. A member's score will go up if they secure opposite party co-sponsors or seek out a good bill to co-sponsor that was introduced by the other side,"" Diller said. ""On that basis, Ted Cruz does have the second worst lifetime score (239th out of 240 Senators) over the period covered by our Index (1993-2016). That is a fact,"" Diller wrote. Diller elaborated: ""We believe compromise is an essential part of the legislative process. But beyond that, 50% of the Bipartisan Index score measures a senator's ability to get broad support for their own ideas (as evidenced by co-sponsors attracted from the other party to their bills). So in essence if a member brags about a low Bipartisan Index score, they are bragging that their own bills have a limited appeal. They are acknowledging that they are offering ‘message bills’ designed to appeal to the base, rather than making a real attempt to address problems through legislation,"" Diller said. Diller, asked about Cruz’s 2017 ranking not being nearly worst, said the Texan’s negative 1.03 score for the year still should be considered ""very poor."" Diller said any score below zero ""is considered partisan because it is below the historical baseline. Anything below. -.05 is considered poor. Anything below -1.00 is considered very poor. Usually -1.00 will rank in the bottom 20% of any Congress, as it does in this case,"" Diller wrote. Tallying 2017 cosponsorships with Democrats Wondering how frequently Cruz tried to team with Democrats in 2017, we searched the GovTrack.us website and identified 21 Democratic-authored measures cosponsored by Cruz that year including the Israel Anti-Boycott Act offered by Sen. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md. and the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2018 sponsored by Sen. Kamela Harris, D-Calif. Another search showed that the senator with the year’s highest bipartisan index score, Susan Collins, R-Me., co-sponsored 133 Democratic-authored proposals. The other Texas senator, Republican John Cornyn, co-sponsored 33 Democratic-initiated measures, GovTrack.us says. A political scientist’s take We asked Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist specializing in legislative politics and political parties, to comment on the center's bipartisanship scores. By email, Koger called the scoring fair. He further suggested that O’Rourke’s claim is supported by Cruz’s record. ""From the day he was sworn in as a U.S. senator, Cruz seemed intent on running for president as the only national politician willing to fight his own party for conservative goals,"" Koger wrote. ""That is, he sought to make every other Republican senator look like a weak sell-out by publicly opposing bipartisan compromise, particularly on the fiscal year 2014 budget. He was the public leader of the Republicans who advocated for a government shutdown in October 2013. This shutdown was bad for the Republican Party's image and for the governance of the country, but Cruz achieved his personal goal of displaying his willingness to blow up bipartisan compromises."" After this fact-check published, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us by email that the senator has worked on substantial bipartisan legislation including proposals to combat sexual assault, reauthorize NASA and champion civil rights. Our ruling O’Rourke said that ""only one other senator from either party over the last 25 years"" has ""a worse record on bipartisanship"" than Cruz. That conclusion is backed up by an index based on sponsorships and co-sponsorships of substantive legislation computed by the Georgetown University center named after Richard Lugar, the former Indiana senator.

Jarrett claims Obama has majority support for health care plan
","
As Democratic health care reform bills move toward votes in the House and the Senate, supporters and opponents alike have tried to harness public opinion polls to bolster their own arguments. One recent example came during the Nov. 1, 2009, edition of ABC News'

This Week with George Stephanopoulos

, during a question-and-answer session with White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett.


STEPHANOPOULOS: ""Our latest polling shows that there is not majority support for the president's health care plans.""


JARRETT: ""Well, we actually think that there is. And I suppose it depends upon what poll you're looking at.""


We decided to put Jarrett's claim to the test by looking at roughly the last six weeks of public opinion polls that asked questions related to general support for, or opposition to, health proposals put forward by the president or by Democrats generally. We chose the past six weeks to keep the data fresh in this fast-changing debate.


Before looking at the data, we should explain which polls we have decided to include, and not include, in our study. Our main starting point for polling information was the Web site

pollster.com

, a nonpartisan site affiliated with

National Journal

magazine that maintains a constantly updated database of poll releases. We tried to stick to questions that focused on general support or opposition to the plan, rather than more specific details such as whether to offer a government-run ""public option"" for health insurance, because the number of possible poll questions would quickly get out of hand.


In addition, we decided to include only independently sponsored telephone polls and exclude Internet-based polls. Making this distinction hurts the president's cause somewhat, because one Internet poll -- the

Economist

/YouGov poll -- has on several recent occasions shown a small majority of respondents in favor of the Democratic plan. But we have decided to exclude Internet polls to remain consistent with mainstream professional opinion, which does not yet consider Internet polling to be as trustworthy as telephone polling. We are, however, including telephone polls conducted by machines rather than live humans.


Also, since Jarrett specifically referred to ""majority support,"" we will not count in the White House's favor polls unless the support breaks the 50 percent barrier.


Using the pollster.com database, we found three polls conducted in October -- all done by live telephone interviews -- that reported true majority support for the Democratic proposal, though hardly by supermajorities. They are:


-- A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll taken between Oct. 16 and Oct. 18 asked, ""What do you think would be better for the country -- if Congress passed a bill to change the country's health care system along the lines of what Barack Obama has proposed, or if the current system were left in place with no changes?"" The survey found that 53 percent said it would be better to pass a bill, while 44 percent said to leave the current system intact. The poll had 1,038 adult respondents and a 3 percentage point margin of error.


-- A Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted between Oct. 8 and Oct. 15 asked, ""Do you think the country as a whole would be better off or worse off if the president and Congress passed health care reform, or don't you think it would make much difference?"" In this poll, 53 percent said the country would be better off, 28 percent said it would be worse off and 12 percent said it would not make much difference. The poll had 1,200 adult respondents and a 3 percentage point margin of error.


-- A Gallup poll taken between Oct. 1 and Oct. 4 asked, ""Would you advise your member of Congress to vote for or against a health care bill this year?"" To this question, 51 percent said their lawmaker should vote for it and 41 percent said their lawmaker should vote against it. This poll interviewed 1,013 adults, with a 4 percentage point margin of error. (Technical note: The results for this question are a little more complicated than most. On the interviewer's first pass, 40 percent of respondents said they'd advise a vote in favor, 36 percent advised a vote against, and 25 percent said they had no opinion. Then, the interviewer asked the undecideds a second question to see how they were leaning; those answers were added to the initial totals to come up with 51 percent advising passage and 41 percent advising rejection.)


Most of the time, though, similar questions have found opponents outnumbering supporters. Just to cite a few examples (there are too many to list them all):


-- An NBC/

Wall Street Journal

poll taken between Oct. 22 and Oct. 25 asked, ""From what you have heard about Barack Obama's health care plan, do you think his plan is a good idea or a bad idea? If you do not have an opinion either way, please just say so."" On this question, 38 percent said it was a good idea and 42 percent said it was a bad idea. In the five NBC/

Wall Street Journal

polls going back to April 2009, the answer ""good idea"" never exceeded 39 percent.



-

- An ABC News/

Washington

Post poll taken Oct. 15 to Oct. 18 asked, ""Overall, given what you know about them, would you say you support or oppose the proposed changes to the health care system being developed by Congress and the Obama administration?"" On this question, 45 percent said they support the changes while 48 percent said they oppose them. In two previous ABC/

Post

surveys that asked the same question, opponents always outnumbered supporters, with supporters never breaking 46 percent.


-- A Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll taken between Oct. 13 and Oct. 14 asked, ""Based on what you know about the health care legislation being considered right now, do you favor or oppose the plan?"" The pollsters found that 35 percent favored it and 54 percent opposed it. In four prior polls going back to July 2009, the survey never found supporters leading opponents, and supporters never exceeded 38 percent.


-- Finally, a series of Rasmussen polls, which were conducted by machines rather than live interviewers, have consistently found strong opposition to the Democratic health care proposal. The most recent of these, taken between Oct. 30 and Oct. 31, asked, ""Generally speaking, do you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose or strongly oppose the health care reform plan proposed by President Obama and the congressional Democrats?"" It found that 42 percent favored the plan either strongly or somewhat, while 54 percent opposed it strongly or somewhat.


Most polls have had ""little change over the course of the year,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""It is certainly fair to say that no poll shows solid majority support"" for the Democratic plan.


So why did three scattered polls buck the general trend? The most likely factors are two issues often raised in conjunction with polling methodology: the nature of the population sampled, and the way the questions are worded.


On the sampling question, the Fox and Rasmussen surveys sampled registered voters and likely voters, respectively, rather than all adults, as the other polls did. Interviewing only registered voters and -- especially -- likely voters weeds out Americans who are relatively disengaged with the political scene. This can be helpful in measuring support for candidates during election season, but when applied to the issue of health care, it can skew the pool of respondents against the White House. ""Polls that screen for registered or likely voters tend to get fewer of the younger and minority voters that have been Obama's strongest supporters,"" said Mark Blumenthal, who runs pollster.com. And not surprisingly, those polls showed the strongest opposition to the Democratic plan.


As for wording, it appears that how a question is phrased -- always a key issue in producing the most accurate survey results -- is especially important when asking broad questions related to the current health care debate. For instance, ""those that describe it as only an Obama plan seem to get more support than those that emphasize the 'Democrats in Congress,' "" Blumenthal said. And when the CNN poll asked, ""What do you think would be better for the country -- if Congress passed a bill to change the country's health care system along the lines of what Barack Obama has proposed, or if the current system were left in place with no changes,"" it framed the Democratic plan squarely in opposition to the current health care system, whose shortcomings are apparent even to the president's critics. That wording may help explain the relatively large support for the president in that question.


Let's summarize. Recent polls that asked general health care reform questions have found consistent opposition to the Democratic plan. In polls of all adults, it has often been opposition by a modest margin, while polls of registered or likely voters have found more intense opposition. But independent pollsters have produced three surveys in the past six weeks that found supporters narrowly cracking the 50 percent barrier. So part of what Jarrett said -- ""I suppose it depends upon what poll you're looking at"" -- is undeniably true. On balance though, those poll-verified majorities are the exception rather than the rule. We rule her statement Barely True.

 List your guns on your 1040? No -- this bill never passed
","
It's a scary time to be a gun owner in the United States — at least if you believe some of the claims made by gun-rights groups and spread in chain e-mails.


We recently investigated a

claim made by Gun Owners of America

that a version of a health care bill currently in Congress ""could be used to ban guns in home self-defense,"" and rated it False. We gave the National Rifle Association a Pants on Fire for making

a similar claim

during the 2008 election.
 
So we were skeptical when a reader forwarded us a chain e-mail that claims the following:
 
""Now 'all Guns' must be listed on your next (2010) tax return! As if we didnt [sic] have enough to get upset about! If you have a gun, I hope it isn't registered! Senate Bill SB-2099 will require us to put on our 2009 1040 federal tax form all guns that you have or own. It will require fingerprints and a tax of $50 per gun.""


The e-mail continued:


""This bill was introduced on Feb.. 24, 2009, by the Obama staff. BUT... this bill will only become public knowledge 30 days after the new law becomes effective! This is an amendment to the Internal Revenue Act of 1986. This means that the Finance Committee has passed this without the Senate voting on it at all. Trust Obama ? ...... you must be kidding!""
 
The e-mail is wrong in so many ways that it's hard to know where to begin. But here we go:
 
• The ""Obama staff"" can't introduce bills, only members of Congress can.
 
• No such bill was introduced on Feb. 24 of this year. But there was such a bill introduced on Feb. 24, 2000, by Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island.
 
• The bill didn't pass. Indeed, it died in committee, as most bills do. The e-mail wrongly says the law will take effect with your ""next tax return."" The bill would have required people to register handguns in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, the government would have shared that information with law enforcement agencies, and guns would have been taxed when they were manufactured or sold. But again, the bill did not pass.
 
• The National Rifle Association wrote a blog post discrediting the e-mail, saying that it was ""recycling an old alert that wasn’t even accurate when it was new,"" and noting that the bill in question ""disappeared without any action by the Senate, back when Bill Clinton was still in the White House.""
 
The e-mail is also ridiculously false with its claim that ""this bill will only become public knowledge 30 days after the new law becomes effective."" Although Congress has its share of closed-door meetings, bills are made public on the

Thomas Web site

. Indeed, that's how we found this one.
 
It's worth noting that variations of this chain e-mail have been circulating for many years. The Web site UrbanLegends.about.com

wrote about this rumor

back in September 2000. Only recently has a new version emerged. And like so many incorrect e-mails we've examined lately, it targets President Barack Obama.


This e-mail makes so many ridiculously false claims that we have to set the meter ablaze — Pants on Fire!

"['National', 'Corporations', 'Health Care', 'Patrick Kennedy']","
Insurance companies do not get a third of all national health spending
","
Rep. Patrick Kennedy gave a strong defense of Democratic plans for health reform on the House floor, attacking Republican opponents as defenders of insurance companies.
 
""The other side talks about the health care reform bill costing a lot of money,"" Kennedy said. ""Right now, consumers in America are spending millions and millions of dollars paying that to the insurance companies. One-third of the health care dollar goes to no such thing as health care; it goes to the insurance companies. That's why the Democratic proposal restricts the amount of money that insurance companies can spend on bureaucracy.""
 
The idea that insurance companies get a third of all health spending in the country struck us as suspicious. And sure enough, our research showed that Kennedy was mixing up his statistics.
 
To start with, every health insurance company is different, and there are different ways to count administrative expenses. Generally speaking, the most efficient insurers cover large groups of employees, while the least efficient sell policies to individuals.
 
Nevertheless, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency, publishes national health expenditure data, which include a breakdown of ""The Nation's Health Dollar."" The most recent data for 2007 show that private insurers get a little less than 7 percent of the nation's health care spending.
 
The 7 percent number also includes some of the administrative costs of government health insurance programs and charity programs, but the center said most of that is for private insurers.
 
We reviewed another study done by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It looked at administrative costs from a different angle, trying to focus on what percentage of health insurance premiums went to patient costs. Keep in mind, spending on private health insurance premiums is less than all national health care spending, which includes government spending for Medicare and Medicaid, and other expenditures.
 
The CBO included a bunch of things under administrative costs: marketing; claims processing; managing contracts with doctors and hospitals; quality assurance; regulatory compliance; information technology expenses; general overhead; profits and taxes. It found that the percentage of premiums going to all these activities was 12 percent.
 
We asked Kennedy's office about his statement, and staffers said Kennedy meant to say that he was talking about administrative expenses throughout the health care system. They sent us a study from the

New England Journal of Medicine

that examined administrative costs for doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, home care agencies and employers who provide insurance. The study found total administrative costs for all those groups accounted for 31 percent of health care expenditures in the United States.
 
Still, that's not anywhere close to what Kennedy said. He said that ""One-third of the health care dollar goes to no such thing as health care; it goes to the insurance companies."" The actual number is about 7 percent. We rate Kennedy's statement False.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Pop Culture', 'Bono']","
Bono claims U.S. gives about half the aid as European countries, percentage-wise
","

With all due respect to the musical prowess of Bill Clinton and Mike Huckabee, we think this is the first time we've checked a bona fide rock icon with our Truth-O-Meter.

 

But U2's Bono is no ordinary rock star. He's also a political activist, using his pop status to advocate for African aid and AIDS relief.

 

Which is how Bono came to be asked by an Associated Press music writer what he thought about President Barack Obama with regard to funding the fight against AIDS in Africa.

 

""The Obama administration is just getting going,"" Bono said. ""(He) has promised to double aid over the next years, because even though (President George W.) Bush tripled it ... the United States is still about half as what European countries give as a percentage, and I think he knows that's not right.""

 

We decided to check whether Bono was right that ""the United States is still about half as what European countries give as a percentage.""

 

This turned into a tricky fact-check because Bono appears to have interchanged two different funding issues in his comment: global HIV/AIDS relief and foreign aid.

 

Bono says Obama has promised to ""double aid over the next years."" Obama

has

pledged to increase AIDS funding, but not double. He has, though, promised to double foreign aid by 2015. In the same sentence, though, Bono then says President Bush ""tripled it."" The ""it"" there is the U.S. commitment to global AIDS relief (not foreign aid). So when Bono said ""the United States is still about half as what European countries give as a percentage,"" is he talking about AIDS relief or foreign aid in general?

 

The folks at ONE (the organization co-founded by Bono to fight extreme poverty and preventable disease, particularly in Africa) said Bono was talking here about foreign aid in general

—

he has used this statistic in the past.

 

And on that front, Bono is on pretty firm ground. The key qualifier there is ""as a percentage."" Because the U.S. government distributes more in foreign aid than any other country, by far. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international group of the world's 30 leading industrial countries, reports that in 2008, the United States distributed about $26 billion in net official development assistance. The next closest country was Germany, at nearly $14 billion, and the United Kingdom, with about $11.4 billion.

 

But considered as a percentage of gross national income (which is essentially the more familiar gross domestic product plus or minus income from other countries), you'll have to go to the bottom of the list to find the United States. We note that none of the countries gives more than 1 percent of GNI. The U.S. gave 0.18 percent. By comparison, here's how some of the European biggies fared: United Kingdom, 0.43 percent; Germany, 0.38 percent; France, 0.39 percent; Spain, 0.43 percent. In other words, it's fair to say the United States is providing about half as much development assistance as European countries, as a percentage of GNI.
 
 

There are a lot of other factors to consider when it comes to foreign assistance, though: debt reduction, trade, money from private foundations, to name a few. Suffice to say, you can look at this data in countless ways. And some groups that have attempted to quantify foreign aid on some of these various factors have found the United States to be on par with its European counterparts. But we think it's certainly fair for Bono to cite this statistic from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and had he been clear that he was talking about foreign aid, his statement would have been largely accurate.

 

But that was not at all clear. In fact, based on the context of his comments, most people would probably conclude that Bono was talking about

global AIDS relief

, and that the United States only gives about half as much as Europeans ""as a percentage."" And that is not right.

 

In fact, in 2008, the United States accounted for more than half (51.3 percent) of all the the global AIDs relief disbursed by governments around the world, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation and UNAIDS. Even when standardized to account for the size of the countries' relative economies, the United States ranked fourth highest, well higher than most European countries. The only ones higher were the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Bono's homeland, Ireland.

 

Again, some make strong arguments against the use of such rankings because, for example, they don't take into account private donations from foundations. When it comes to AIDS relief from foundations, the United States far outpaces Europe. That's because the United States provides generous tax incentives for such largess. So some argue the U.S. government ought to get credit for at least some of that funding.

 

By any measure, though, Europe is not spending twice as much, ""as a percentage,"" on AIDS relief than the United States. The Bush administration deserves a great deal of credit for that. In 2003, Bush initiated a $15 billion plan to address global AIDS relief, mostly for countries in Africa where the AIDS epidemic is staggering. And then in 2008, Congress

—

Democrats and Republicans alike

—

more than tripled the HIV/AIDS relief budget to $48 billion over the next five years. Obama, meanwhile, pledged to provide at least $50 billion by 2013 for the global fight against HIV/AIDS.

 

""The Bush administration showed real leadership on global HIV/AIDS,"" said Eric Lief, a senior associate with the Henry L. Stimson Center. ""U.S. funding grew exponentially during the last eight years. Since 2001, the U.S. has funded a disproportionate share of global AIDS assistance. But global funding is still far short of anything close to global need. The Obama administration has committed to continuing the upward trend.""

 

As for foreign aid, the United States remains the world’s largest funder in terms of dollars spent, said Lief, who served on the State Department's policy planning staff under President Bill Clinton and was once a senior adviser with the U.N. Joint Program on HIV/AIDS in Geneva.

 

""In other ways and by other measures, the U.S. falls short in terms of support for the developing world,"" he said. ""Single-index 'rankings' of governments are overused politically. What we’re buying with foreign aid dollars is a much more important question than how much we’re spending, and the U.S. record is mixed.""

 

Now might be a good time to note that Bono appears to be doing wonderful work as a spokesman trying to draw attention to dire poverty and health issues in Africa. And one member of the PolitiFact team gives Bono's performance on the current U2 tour a big thumbs up.

 

But our review of Bono's performance with this comment is more mixed. Again, if Bono had clearly switched gears and said he was talking about foreign aid when he said the United States only gives about half as much as Europe, as a percentage, he'd be right

—

at least according to one measure from the respected OECD. But in the context of the interview, Bono appeared to be talking about AIDS relief

—

in which case he'd be wrong. We checked with the AP reporter who did the interview, and it was her understanding that he was talking about global AIDS relief. At the least, by toggling back and forth between statistics on foreign aid and global HIV/AIDS relief, Bono left room for confusion. And so we rate him Half True.

Conservative group says health care reform bill allows government to pry into tax records
","
Concerned Women for America, a conservative group, says the Democrats' health care reform bill could allow the government to peek into your tax records.


On its Web site, the group states, ""Not only are your medical records at risk under Obamacare, but your financial records too. The proposed bill expressly gives a new Health Choices Commissioner the right to look at an individual's tax return to determine what medical benefits or subsidies that person qualifies for.""


The CWA statement seems to be referring to the health care bill (H.R. 3200) that was approved in the summer of 2009 by three House committees. That bill — which formed the basis for the version from the House Democratic leadership introduced on Oct. 29, 2009 — would create a health choices commissioner. This new post would wield broad authority over the federal program, including setting minimum standards for health care plans, operating a new health insurance exchange and, most importantly for the purposes of the CWA's claim, determining who will qualify for federal subsidies to buy health insurance.


Under the bill, Congress would set income levels to establish who is eligible for ""affordability credits,"" which are designed for people in the lower middle class who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but who don't earn enough to buy their own insurance. The credits would allow them to get insurance on the health care exchange, a new virtual marketplace for people who are currently uninsured or buy coverage on the individual market. The commissioner is assigned to determine who qualifies.


H.R. 3200 includes a passage that gives the commissioner authority to get tax records to determine how much people earn: ""In carrying out this subtitle, the Commissioner shall request from the Secretary of the Treasury consistent with section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 such information as may be required to carry out this subtitle."" In the new House bill introduced on Oct. 29, lawmakers included similar language.


We looked up Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code and found that it does indeed cover ""Confidentiality and Disclosure of Returns and Return Information."" So the passage in the bill does indicate that the CWA is right that the commissioner would have the ability to access information from tax returns in order to run the program that provides individual affordability credits.


Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee bill — which would also provide health insurance subsidies for qualifying Americans — has language similar to that in the House bills, with the main difference being that it would rely on the Department of Health and Human Services rather than the newly created health choices commissioner. ""The bill permits the IRS to substantiate the accuracy of income and family size information that has been provided to HHS for eligibility determination,"" the Senate bill states.


So in this regard, the House and Senate are consistent, and CWA's claim is largely correct. Still, experts we spoke with offered a couple of caveats.


• The notion that federal officials would look at tax information to determine ""medical benefits"" is a significant exaggeration. The bills allow the government to use tax information when determining if someone is eligible for subsidies. But it is incorrect to suggest, as CWA seems to do, that the commissioner might deny a specific treatment for a disease based on something on one's tax return.


Our experts could think of only one scenario in which a federal official's use of personal tax information might influence benefits, and that would be indirectly. If someone applied for a subsidy to purchase a private plan, but officials found that their income was too low to be eligible for the subsidy, they would need to apply instead for Medicaid, the federal-state program that provides health care for the poor. Presumably, Medicaid and the private plan the person had been looking at would offer a different package of benefits.


But even if that happened, there's reason to think that Medicaid would actually offer a better and cheaper package for the beneficiary than private coverage, especially if they have a disability, said Edwin Park, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. And in any case, there's nothing included in any of the health care bills that says that federal officials would be determining specific medical treatments based on information gleaned from a tax return.


• The group was a bit overbroad in characterizing what private information federal officials could look at. While the CWA said that the commissioner would have ""the right to look at an individual's tax return to determine what medical benefits or subsidies that person qualifies for,"" the commissioner would actually have the right to look at the

pertinent information

from that return — not the entire return. In this case, that would include such information as a taxpayer's filing status, number of dependents and modified adjusted gross income.

 

• The commissioner would not be looking at everyone's tax information — only the information for people who apply for the affordability credits. (And even then, it's not clear whether the commissioner would request information for every applicant or simply spot-check for audit purposes.)

 

• Finally, this authority to review tax information isn't new. Under existing law, tax returns, or information from returns, can be shared with federal, state or judicial officials for many reasons, including:

 

— Social Security benefits, food stamps, unemployment benefits, and federal housing subsidies

— Tracking down people who are behind in child support or are delinquent on their student loans

— Various forms of Medicare benefits


While we conclude that the CWA is partly right on this one, it has cranked up the hyperbole. Federal officials would be able to look at specific tax information, but they couldn't go through entire returns. And while officials would have the power to see private tax information, they would not be able to use it to decide what specific medical treatments someone would receive. So we find the group's claim Half True.

Does Obama need Congress' permission to get Nobel?
","Three Republican members of Congress wrote President Barack Obama a letter telling him he needs to ""obtain Congress' consent before formally accepting the Nobel Prize.""

The members — Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite and Rep. Cliff Stearns of Florida, and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas — point to Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, which reads, in part:

""No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.""

In their letter, they write, ""As the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by a committee appointed by the Parliament of Norway, the Storting, the prize is clearly subject to the requirements set forth in Article 1, Section 9, of the Constitution. Obtaining permission from Congress should be straightforward.""

They said the precedent was set when President Theodore Roosevelt created a committee to hold his prize money and then obtained the consent of Congress to send the money to various charities. Roosevelt received the prize in 1906 for mediating a peace agreement between Russia and Japan.

We wanted to know if the representatives were correct that Obama has to obtain the permission of Congress before accepting the prize, which he was awarded for his diplomatic efforts on international cooperation and nuclear disarmament.

We went down many avenues of research here.

The Nobel Peace Prize includes a cash gift of about $1.4 million, so that seems to fit the definition of a ""present."" The Republican members are also correct that the members of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee are appointed by the Norwegian parliament, the Storting.

But it's not clear that the Nobel Peace Prize could be considered as being given by ""a foreign state."" The committee's Web site says it ""is formally independent even of the Storting, and since 1901 it has repeatedly emphasized its independence"" and that it was ""appointed by the Storting (the Norwegian Parliamant), but without the committee being formally responsible to the Storting."" Over the years, the Storting has taken steps to distance itself from the committee to emphasize that the award is ""not an act of Norwegian foreign policy."" The Nobel prizes are administered by a foundation, the Nobel Foundation, and the only reason the Norwegian parliament is involved is because prize founder Alfred Nobel said in his will that he would like members of the Storting to pick the committee members for the peace prize. The other prizes have other selectors. Here's the quote from his will, dated Nov. 27, 1895: ""The prizes for physics and chemistry shall be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; that for physiological or medical work by the Caroline Institute in Stockholm; that for literature by the Academy in Stockholm, and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storting."" (By the way, the Nobel Foundation is based in Sweden, not Norway, which has also been a source of confusion and controversy over the years.) We asked White House officials for their thoughts on the matter, and they firmly said that the Nobel Prize is not awarded by a foreign government. Spokeswoman  Kate Bedingfield gave us this statement: ""The President is donating the money to charity. The statute cited does not apply because the gift is from the Nobel Foundation — a private foundation — not a foreign government. The President is free to do what he likes with the money, and he has chosen to donate it to charity."" Even if the Nobel Prize would be considered as coming from a foreign government, there is compelling evidence that a president does not have to seek special permission from Congress, because Congress already allows it, via statute. Law professor David Kopel researched the issue and posted  a detailed analysis  on the respected legal blog  The Volokh Conspiracy  .

Kopel located a statute, which we reviewed, that allows American officeholders and government employees to  accept foreign prizes  if the recipients meet a number of requirements. The statute specifically mentions that the president and the vice president are included. Kopel said the statute allows a president to accept the prize without any additional permission, as long as he turns the prize money over to his ""employing agency,"" which would likely be an office of the White House.

""Thus, it seems clear that the statute already supplies the constitutionally-required congressional consent for President Obama to accept the Nobel Peace Prize, and no further action by Congress is needed, provided that President Obama signs the check over (to) the government, as the statute requires,"" Kopel wrote.

Kopel told us that the statute appears to have been written in 1966, with several revisions since then, so it wouldn't have applied to Roosevelt or Wilson.

The problem Obama might run into, Kopel said, is if he wants to direct the money to a specific charity. For that, he would need permission from Congress, because the Constitution says ""No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law."" That might be the more pertinent reason Roosevelt sought permission from Congress when it came to giving the money to charity. Roosevelt wanted to use his prize money for a new ""Industrial Peace Committee"" so Congress created a commission, according to news reports. The committee must have never gotten off the ground, because years later, Roosevelt asked Congress to direct the money toward war relief. We looked for formal Peace Prize authorizations from Congress for Roosevelt and President Woodrow Wilson, the two sitting presidents who have previously received the prize. (Wilson received the prize in 1920 for his work the previous year establishing the League of Nations, a forerunner of the United Nations.) We couldn't find any authorizations, and we double-checked with librarians who specialize in historical congressional research, and they couldn't find anything either. We were also unable to find out what Wilson did with his money; one biography said Wilson was worried about his finances and suggested that he simply kept the money. In his defense, he was in poor health when he left office, and presidents didn't get a pension back then. Finally, a more contemporary comparison to the flap over Obama's prize might be the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize. That year, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger won the prize along with Le Duc Tho of North Vietnam for their efforts to negotiate a peace agreement for the Vietnam War — though Le Duc Tho rejected the prize. We found op-eds from American liberals who thought Kissinger didn't deserve it, and many protests from university students and faculty. Members of the Norwegian parliament were also reportedly infuriated and said they planned to look into the committee's operations. But we didn't find that Kissinger received any special permission to accept the prize. Kissinger told the press he wanted the prize money to go to scholarships for the children of soldiers killed or missing in action. Kissinger donated the money — back then it was $50,000 — to Community Funds Inc., a companion organization of New York Community Trust, and it created a scholarship fund that was expected to last about 10 years, according to a 1974 news report. There was no mention in the news report of Congress authorizing this, and we couldn't find anything in the  Congressional Record  on the donation, either. This is a tricky one for us. This is a matter of legal interpretation that may ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. We understand the Republicans' point — although it's a tenuous one, in our view — that the Nobel committee might be considered a governmental panel. We believe much evidence points to the contrary — that the Storting's sole task is to appoint members, and then the government's connection to the prize ends. The Nobel Foundation is not part of the Norwegian government; it's a private Swedish foundation. And we haven't found any evidence to show that Roosevelt, Wilson or Kissinger sought permission from the government to accept the prize. But the tenuous link is enough to earn a Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2009/oct/29/ginny-brown-waite/does-president-need-permission-congress-accept-nob/

Chain e-mail claims Obama is handing out free cell phones to the needy
","
A reader recently sent us a chain e-mail about a cell phone deal.

 

""Receive (1) a FREE new phone and (2) approx 70 minutes of FREE minutes every month,"" the e-mail said.

 

The catch? They're only available to welfare recipients.

 

""I had a former employee call me earlier today inquiring about a job, and at the end of the conversation he gave me his phone number,"" the e-mail said. ""I asked the former employee if this was a new cell phone number and he told me yes this was his 'Obama phone'... TAX PAYER MONEY IS BEING REDISTRIBUTED TO WELFARE RECIPIENTS FOR FREE CELL PHONES.""

 

The chain e-mail — we've received copies from several readers — calls them ""Obama phones,"" which suggests the program is new. It says the cell phone program threatens ""the very foundations that this country was built on,"" and ""the age old concepts of God, family, and hard work.""

 

A federal program offering 70 minutes a month sounded unusual to us, so we decided to look into it. 
 
The e-mail included a link to the TracPhone Web site, a prepaid cell phone company, and its SafeLink Wireless program to help low-income people get cellular coverage. Depending on where participants live, free phones and free minutes are available; participants in Washington, D.C., for example, can get 55 free minutes per month, while consumers in Florida can get 68 free minutes a month.

 

AT&T and Verizon provide similar services.

 

All those perks are the result of Federal Communications Commission programs to help low-income people get phone service. Specifically, Lifeline, which TracPhone participates in, provides discounts on basic monthly phone service, and Link-Up America helps those who qualify get telephone service by paying one-half of the startup fee, according to the FCC Web site. Eligible participants must have an income that is at or below 135 percent of the federal poverty level or use Medicaid, food stamps, federal public housing assistance, or supplemental security income, among other things. In some cases, states administer their own programs.

 

We spoke with Rosemary Kimball, an FCC spokeswoman, to get more details.

 

She said consumers can qualify for a cell phone plan if they don't have access to a land-line. Though the exact details of the benefit vary from state to state, cell phone providers typically provide low-income consumers with some form of a monthly discount, whether it be free minutes or a reduced rate, she said.

 

And here's a key detail: The program is more than decade old.

 

Kimball said it comes from the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which amended the Communications Act of 1934 to require low-income assistance. The law required the FCC to create the Universal Service Fund, a pool of money subsidized by small charges on our phone bills (we checked our bill and found we kicked in $2.80 last month) and redistributed to the low-income service programs as well as programs that bring telecommunications services to rural areas and schools. And the LifeLine program has been around even longer — since 1985.


It's a matter of opinion whether this program threatens the very foundations this country was built on. But the e-mail is correct that tax dollars are being used to support the cell phone program. Still, it mischaracterizes the program by making it seem as if it was created by the Obama administration. In fact, Lifeline and Link-Up have been around for nearly 14 years. These are not ""Obama phones."" (Maybe we should call them ""Clinton phones."") So we rate the claim Barely True.

Health care reform will not force people into a government-run plan
","
When Democratic Sen. Harry Reid announced this week that he was including a form of a public option in health care reform, Republicans didn't like it.


""Whether you call it a public option, an opt-out, a trigger, or a co-op, the fact is all of these proposals put us on the path to government-run health care,"" said Republican House leader John Boehner. ""Forcing Americans off of their current health coverage and onto a government-run plan isn't the answer, but that's exactly what the Democrats' plan would do.""


We've been studying the health care reform proposals in both the House and the Senate for some time now. All the plans have rules that would prevent people from being ""forced"" off their current health coverage and into a government-run plan.


We asked Boehner's office for a response. Staffers sent us to a

study by the Lewin Group

, which predicts that 123 million people would be enrolled in a public plan three years after the exchange is opened. (The Lewin Group is respected by many health care analysts and operates with editorial independence, but it is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, whose primary business is private health insurance.)


Here's an outline of the general argument on how 123 million people could become enrolled in a public plan: The public option will be a health insurance plan backed by the U.S. government, so it will have access to unlimited taxpayer funds and have unsurpassed bargaining power with hospitals and doctors. It will be able to force providers to accept low payments, such as what Medicare, the government-run health program for seniors, pays. So the public option will be the cheapest insurance option available on the exchange. Employers will see this and decide to sign up all their workers for the public option. The private insurance industry will wither and die. A single-payer system is upon us.


The problem with this line of reasoning is that the Democratic proposals so far include rules specifically to stop this from happening. We'll take it point-by-point:


• The public option is not to be supplemented with unlimited taxpayer funds. The House and Senate bills say the federal government can support its administrative expenses when it begins, but it will have to be self-sustaining with patient premiums.


• It will not be able to force hospitals and doctors to accept Medicare rates. The details of how the public option will work are still being developed, but committees in the House and Senate have indicated the public option should have to negotiate rates with providers, not pay Medicare rates.


• Most employers will not have access to the health care exchange. The Senate Finance Committee proposal is very clear on this point; only small businesses will have access to the exchange. The House proposal is a little less clear. In the third year, it gives a health commissioner the power to allow businesses into the exchange. But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office seemed to think the exchange would continue to be restricted to smaller businesses. The CBO projected

only 30 million people

would be in the exchange by 2019, a number too small to imply that all employers would be given access.


• Employers can't sign up their employees for a health care plan. The House and Senate proposals specifically forbid that. The employer can provide a set amount of money as a benefit, but the employee decides which plan to buy. If an employee is willing to pay more for a more generous plan, the employer can't stop him. And employers definitely can't force employees to enroll in the public option against their will.


An argument others have made along these same lines: If a public option is offered on the exchange, employers will dump their coverage and send them into the exchange to buy their own insurance. This is a largely speculative argument, however. Employers are under significant competitive pressure to offer health plans to recruit and retain workers, according to experts we've spoken with. Surveys show that workers see health insurance as the top benefit affecting their decisions on where they work. If there's evidence to indicate that the availability of a public option would overcome that dynamic, we haven't found it.


There's another argument specific to seniors that Boehner's staff pointed to as evidence for his statement. They said that under the Democratic plans, seniors in Medicare Advantage would have to switch to regular Medicare. We've looked at this argument before: Medicare Advantage is a government program that pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries. It was conceived as a cost-containment measure on the theory that competition among private plans would drive down costs. That has not happened. The health care proposals would stop the extra payments that Medicare Advantage receives. (About 23 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage.)


So it is conceivable that some people in

Medicare Advantage will lose some of their current benefits

, and they might have to enroll in regular Medicare. But does this really fit the criteria of ""forcing Americans off of their current health coverage and onto a government-run plan""? While private companies are contractors in the Medicare Advantage program — so it does have more of a free market element to it — at the end of the day, Medicare and Medicare Advantage are both government-run plans, where the government decides how much it will pay for a basic package of benefits.


In refuting this argument, we are not trying to imply that no one will ever have to switch plans if health care reform passes. Indeed, we looked at President Obama's statement, ""If you like your health care plan,

you can keep your health care plan

,"" and rated it Half True, because health care reform will change many aspects of health care regulation, and it seems likely that will prompt insurers, employers and consumers to re-evaluate their health care plans and make changes. Obama later made a more accurate statement, that if you ""already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to

change the coverage or the doctor you have

."" We rated that True.


But we've also found nothing in the proposals so far that would force people off their current coverage into a government-run plan, if they prefer and can pay for private coverage. Boehner said that was ""exactly what the Democrats' plan would do."" So we rate Boehner's statement False.

O'Reilly accuses media of not following Fox's lead on Anita Dunn-Mao Tse-tung story
","In a recent segment with conservative commentator Ann Coulter, Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly slammed other media outlets for failing to cover a story — unearthed by Fox — that a senior aide to Barack Obama had told high school students that one of her ""favorite political philosophers"" was Mao Tse-tung, the late Chinese communist leader who is blamed for the deaths of millions of people.
 
The O'Reilly-Coulter exchange, aired on Oct. 23, 2009, came amid a war of words between the White House and Fox.
 
Anita Dunn, the White House communications director and a longtime Democratic operative, emerged this month as one of the leading figures in a White House push to discredit Fox News, telling the  New York Times  ' Brian Stelter, ""We're going to treat [Fox] the way we would treat an opponent. ... We don't need to pretend that this is the way that legitimate news organizations behave.""
 
Dunn's comments added heat to an already simmering feud, and it wasn't long before Glenn Beck — the conservative Fox host who frequently riles the White House and its allies — responded in kind. On the Oct. 15, 2009, episode of his Fox show, Beck aired a video of a speech Dunn made to high school students.
 
In it, Dunn imparted a series of life lessons to the students, the third of which ""actually comes from two of my favorite political philosophers: Mao Tse-tung and Mother Teresa, not often coupled together, but the two people that I turn to most to basically deliver a simple point, which is, you're going to make choices. You're going to challenge. You're going to say why not. You're going to figure out how to do things that have never been done before.""
 
Dunn then told an anecdote about how Mao triumphed as an underdog over his rival, nationalist leader Chiang Kai-Shek, during the Chinese civil war. Asked how he would win, Mao said, according to Dunn, ""You know, you fight your war, and I'll fight mine.""

Dunn continued, ""And think about that for a second. You don't have to accept the definition of how to do things, and you don't have to follow other people's choices and paths, okay? It is about your choices and your path. You fight your own war. You lay out your own path. You figure out what's right for you. You don't let external definitions define how good you are internally.""
 
Beck's discovery that a senior Obama White House official had said nice things about a Communist leader with a bloody place in history was catnip for Fox, and for a host of conservative bloggers.
 
Let's explore whether O'Reilly is correct that ""only Fox News picked that up. Nobody else picked that up.""
 
It's certainly true that Fox played the story to the hilt: In a 10-day span after the story broke, Fox shows mentioned the incident, either in depth or in passing, roughly two dozen times.
 
As for other news organizations, we found they rarely treated it as a news story. But there was a fair amount of discussion about Dunn's remark, usually in commentaries or analyses of the Fox-White House feud:
 
—  In opinion columns  . Two syndicated columnists based at the  Washington Post  wrote about Dunn's Mao comment. Kathleen Parker, a conservative with a maverick streak, wrote a pox-on-both-their-houses column, while Charles Krauthammer (a frequent panelist on Fox) penned one that was critical of Dunn and favorable to Fox. Both ran on the  Post  's op-ed page and were reprinted in newspapers across the country. A handful of newspapers also wrote editorials that cited the episode.
 
Meanwhile,  Philadelphia Inquirer  columnist Dick Polman published a column in the paper (and later an expanded version online) that took Fox and Beck to task. ""How helpful is Beck, after all, when he morphs into Joe McCarthy on Fox News, and attempts to red-bait a top Obama aide by painting her as a communist sympathizer in thrall to Mao Tse-tung?"" Polman asked. ""Last week, Beck characterized Anita Dunn as a 'fan of a guy who killed millions of people.' He then aired a video clip that showed Dunn quoting Mao during a June speech. Shocking! What Beck naturally neglected to tell his credulous viewers is that politicians of all stripes have been quoting Mao for years. Such as: 'In the words of Chairman Mao, it’s always darkest before it’s totally black.' (That was John McCain). Such as: 'Mao said politics is war without bloodshed. Clearly there are some metaphors that sit nicely with politics.' (That was Christian conservative leader Ralph Reed.)""
 
—  As media criticism  . The  Washington Post'  s   media critic, Howard Kurtz, made brief references to the Mao controversy as he dissected the Fox-White House feud in two of his daily  Media Notes  blog posts.
 
—  In remarks by TV commentators  . On the Oct. 18, 2009, edition of CNN's  State of the Union with John King  , commentators discussed the war between the White House and Fox. Bill Bennett, a conservative, brought up the Dunn-Mao connection. Saying it ""isn't a small thing — it's a big thing,"" Bennett told the panel, ""Now, look, I am not a right-wing nut, and when people go after Obama and say 'socialism and Marxism,' I say, take it easy, you know, calm down. But when she stands up, in a speech to high school kids, says she's deeply influenced by Mao Tse-tung, that — I mean, that is crazy.""
 
Meanwhile, Lou Dobbs, on his nightly news show on CNN, gave a brief hat tip to Beck's story (adding that Mao may have been responsible for ""as many as 100 million"" deaths) before proceeding into a plug for his syndicated radio show, where viewers could ""hear more of my thoughts on all the president's czars and their fascination with Mao Tse-tung.""
 
On CNN (which has had its own war of words with Fox, its longtime cable news rival), the  Situation Room  put resident curmudgeon Jack Cafferty on the Mao story, asking viewers what they thought. ""T.J."" wrote to Cafferty, ""Enough already. Stop reporting anything about Glenn Beck. He is an insane nut job. His opinion is of no value to anyone, except other nut jobs. Stop enabling this psychotic fraud by constantly reporting what he has to say about, well, anything."" ""J.R. in Idaho"" wrote, ""When you report on the stories you have created, you have become illegitimate. Fox is 'balloon boy.'"" Others were critical of the White House for taking on a fight it was unlikely to win.

—  Only rarely as straight news  . The day after Beck aired the video, CNN's Suzanne Malveaux and Ed Hornick posted a Web story in which Dunn said that the Mao quote ""is one I picked up from the late Republican strategist Lee Atwater from something I read in the late 1980s, so I hope I don't get my progressive friends mad at me."" She added that ""the use of the phrase 'favorite political philosophers' was intended as irony, but clearly the effort fell flat — at least with a certain Fox commentator whose sense of irony may be missing.""

On Oct. 18, the Associated Press moved a story that recapped the controversy in a straightforward way. (It was written by the AP's television writer, David Bauder, not one of its national political writers.) A day later, the  Los Angeles Times  ' Top of the Ticket   blog briefly mentioned the Mao-Dunn flap in an item about the larger Fox-White House conflict.
 
And the  New York Times  ' Caucus   blog took up the issue twice. The first time, on Oct. 16, 2009, Sheryl Gay Stolberg wrote a post explaining the Dunn-Mao controversy, saying that ""the war of words between the White House and Fox News is intensifying — and getting personal."" Two days later, the blog offered an update on the Fox-White House war, adding the following quote from Dunn: ""Let it be noted that I also quoted Mother Teresa, but no one is accusing me of being a saint!""

So let's recap. If O'Reilly's point is that few media outlets played the story as worthy of straight news coverage, he's probably right. With only a few exceptions, the media coverage we found consisted either of opinion columns (both pro and con), purposeful mentions of it by TV commentators or as a subject for laughs. However, if we stick to his precise wording, O'Reilly is certainly incorrect that ""only Fox News"" picked up the story. While Fox beat the drum more heavily than anyone — not surprising, since it was the network's story to begin with — CNN and the blogs of several major newspapers also mentioned it. In addition, syndicated versions of two  Washington Post  columns appeared in many newspapers around the country. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2009/oct/27/bill-oreilly/oreilly-accuses-media-not-following-foxs-lead-anit/
"['Environment', 'National', 'Cap and Trade', 'Climate Change', 'Pundits', 'Mary Matalin']","
Matalin claims the Earth is cooling
","Skeptics of climate change often say the world has been cooling in the past decade.

Conservative pundit Mary Matalin made that claim on CNN's  Situation Room  on Oct. 22, 2009. Matalin warned that the Obama administration is pushing too many big legislative initiatives such as a cap-and-trade plan to slow global warming when the administration should be focusing on the deficit.

""If they care about reducing the deficit, which should be their No. 1 priority ... they're not going to be able to do this — all this other nonsense, cap and trade and all the rest of it. Too much, too fast,"" Matalin said. ""Climate change is a fake issue anyway. ... There is not consensus science on what is causing global climate change. There is climate change, but for the last decade the climate has been cooling. There is the science. There is the data on that. They want to do this because they like to have all these programs being controlled by the government.""

So, Matalin acknowledges that the Earth's temperature is changing, but she's not so sure that those changes are man-made. We'll save the debate over whether climate change is caused by human activity for another day. For now, we're going to check Matalin's claim that the Earth has been cooling in recent years.

Last spring, we checked  a similar claim  made by the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank. The group claimed that there has been no net global warming for over a decade; we found that False because the climate scientists we spoke with said that, while temperatures have remained relatively static over the last decade, very little can be learned about climate change in a 10-year window.

Matalin's office sent us a few articles pertaining to the issue,  two   about  a new book by Christopher Booker, a British author and climate change skeptic, who wrote in the Oct. 25 issue of the British newspaper the  Telegraph  that, ""as the world has already been through two of its coldest winters for decades, with all the signs that we may now be entering a third, the scientific case for (carbon dioxide) threatening the world with warming has been crumbling away on an astonishing scale.""

Another study  , published by Bob Carter, a professor of geology at Australia's James Cook University, in the Jan. 20 issue of the  Australian  newspaper argued that ""global atmospheric temperature reached a peak in 1998, has not warmed since 1995 and, has been cooling since 2002.""

Carter is correct that global temperatures hit a high point in 1998. Several entities — including NASA, the Climate Research Unit in the United Kingdom and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States — track temperature changes. Generally speaking, their records show that 1998, a year when a warming pattern called El Nino ruled the weather, is the hottest we've had since scientists started collecting temperature information in the mid 1800s. NASA, on the other hand, pins 2005 as the hottest year on record.

But no matter how you slice the data, temperatures have indisputably fluctuated in the last decade, contrary to Matalin's suggestion that they have cooled.  This graph  from NASA shows that the temperature increased slightly between 2000 and 2001, dropped in 2002, and rose once again the following year. In this case, the annual mean temperature goes up and down, and the five-year mean is on a steady rise.  This graph  from NOAA shows a similar trend, with temperatures dipping slightly at the beginning of the decade and peaking once again in 2005.

We asked Richard Heim, a meteorologist at the NOAA National Climatic Data Center Climate Monitoring Branch, what to make of all these ups and downs.

At the most, it shows a plateau, he said. But certainly not a cooling trend.

""With climate change, not every year is going to be warmer,"" Heim said. ""It's two steps up, two steps down — that's not a indication we're on a massive cooling trend.""

NOAA climate monitoring chief Deke Arndt recently  told the Associated Press  the same thing:

""The last 10 years are the warmest 10-year period of the modern record,"" he said. ""Even if you analyze the trend during that 10 years, the trend is actually positive, which means warming.""

If 1998 is the starting point, a year many climate skeptics tend to cite, everything looks cooler in comparison, said Raymond Bradley, a climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts. He also pointed out that, when evaluating the impact of climate change on temperature, it's misleading to look at only the last 10 years.

A decade is such a small period of time that ""it's like saying, 'It was cold here last week. What happened to climate change?'"" Bradley said.

It's a point we heard repeatedly from the climate experts we interviewed. They all agreed that, while climate temperatures may dip from year to year, it's shortsighted to say changes within a decade mean that climate change is going away.

""If you just take a one-year comparison — say that it's cooler in 2008 than it was in 2007 — that's an improper use of statistics"" to make judgments about climate change, said John Reilly, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""It still remains much warmer than it was in the 1960s. To the extent that there has been some slight cooling, we still remain half-a-degree above what it was then.""

Indeed,  climate   records  show that temperatures have been on the rise since the middle of the century, and that fluctuations between recent years are relatively small compared to overall increase. NASA estimates that global temperatures have risen a total of 2.3 degrees since 1895, and that 13 of the warmest years since 1850 have occurred in the last 14 years.

Jim Hurrell, a senior scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., says these natural temperature variations are expected.

""In the same way that El Nino made 1998 warm, in 2007 and 2008, La Nina made global temperatures a bit cooler than they have been running, but still much warmer than the long-term average,"" Hurrell said referring to El Nino's cooler counterpart.

Citing just the last 10 years ""is a classic case of taking the data and letting it tell a very misleading story,"" he said.

Matalin said, ""for the last decade the climate has been cooling."" That suggests there has been a distinct reversal of the steady warming that scientists have documented for many years. But a review of the data shows that's not the case. The numbers show that in the past 10 years, global temperatures have not continued their sharp increase. But they have not cooled either. In fact, some years in the last decade have been hotter than the previous years. At most, they could be described as hitting a plateau. But they haven't cooled as Matalin said. We find her claim False.",/factchecks/2009/oct/27/mary-matalin/matalin-claims-earth-cooling/

President Bush did give the New York Times interviews
","Calling the Fox News Channel ""the communications arm of the Republican Party,"" White House aides have been complaining about slanted coverage from the cable network. Fox was pointedly excluded from a series of interviews President Barack Obama gave other networks on Sept. 20 about health care reform.

Conservative critics and some independent pundits have said the president is guilty of freezing out a legitimate news network because he doesn't like its coverage.

If that's the case, then President George W. Bush did it, too, said liberal talk show host Rachel Maddow of MSNBC. She said the Bush administration frequently excluded liberal columnists and talk show hosts from meetings Bush held with conservative media. ""Would it surprise you to learn that President Bush never did one interview with the  New York Times  during his entire presidency? Not one in eight years?"" she asked.

That sounded suspicious to us, given that the  New York Times  is one of the largest newspapers in the country.

Sure enough, we were able to find at least three interviews that Bush gave the  New York Times  . (We'll update this item if we find more.)

• On June 5, 2001,  New York Times  reporter Frank Bruni had what he described as Bush's first ""one-on-one interview"" since Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont switched parties and threw control of the Senate to the Democrats. ""We're looking at a different landscape, but still on the same continent,"" Bush said. ""The same votes. The members haven't changed.""

• On Aug 26, 2004, Bush gave a half-hour interview to the  New York Times  as he campaigned through New Mexico. Bush told the newspaper that he did not believe Sen. John Kerry lied about his war record, as some groups alleged during the campaign.

• On Jan. 27, 2005, a week after he started his second term, Bush spoke with  New York Times  reporters for 40 minutes, discussing troop levels in Iraq and domestic issues such as gay adoption, abortion and Social Security.

We couldn't find any interviews after that date, though we did find comments complaining about a lack of access from  New York Times  reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg on the newspaper's   Web site on Nov. 9, 2008. A reader asked Stolberg if the White House played favorites when it came to press access. Stolberg wrote that the  New York Times  had had a standing request to interview Bush, ""since well before I came on this beat in May 2006. So far, no interview — and the reason why is hardly a secret. White House officials are quite open about the fact that we have not gotten an interview because they don't like our coverage. I get e-mails to that effect from them all the time. But the request still stands, and we are hoping for an interview before Mr. Bush leaves office."" That might sound on first blush like the  New York Times  never got an interview  ever  , but the newspaper did have  interviews prior to 2006. The Rachel Maddow Show  told us they were going off a  Los Angeles Times  blog post that was based on Stolberg's comments. The blog post was incorrectly headlined, ""Nine years later the N.Y. Times still awaits its Bush interview."" The show did try to research the issue, ""but obviously our fact-check fell short,"" Maddow said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""We'll air a correction."" To be clear, we're not checking Maddow's broader point that Bush played favorites with the press. Is there any president who hasn't? Rather, we're checking Maddow's statement that President Bush ""never did one interview with the  New York Times  during his entire presidency."" That's not the case, so we rate her statement False.",/factchecks/2009/oct/27/rachel-maddow/president-bush-new-york-times-interviews/

Obama's Columbia 'thesis' is all fiction, dreamed up by blogger
","
When we last spoke with Matthew Avitabile, a grad student in upstate New York who writes a blog called Jumping in Pools,


he had stirred up a hornet's nest with a satirical posting that claimed President Barack Obama wanted soldiers to stop taking an oath to the Constitution and instead pledge their loyalty to the president himself.


That put some conservative bloggers into a tizzy. ""Good g*d — Obama is an egomaniac like we've never seen before. Another Hitler on the rise. This guy is just trashing everything the Consitution stands for,"" wrote someone named Kitty on the blog Tree of Liberty.


The report kept spreading, getting picked up by other bloggers and circulating as a chain e-mail. It earned a

Pants on Fire

from our Truth-O-Meter.


Avitabile, a 22-year-old State University of New York at Albany grad student and self-described moderate Republican, told us back in February that he was surprised the posting — which was labeled satire — could spread so quickly without people verifying the facts. ""People wanted to believe this about the president so bad, that he would really go toward a dictatorship so much, that they would go with it without checking it,"" he said.


Now comes another satirical claim from Avitabile's blog that made it all the way to Rush Limbaugh's show before being debunked. It says that Obama criticized ""plutocratic thugs"" in his thesis at Columbia University:


""Obama was required to write a 'senior seminar' paper in order to graduate from Columbia. The subject of this paper, which totaled 44 pages, was American government. Entitled Aristocracy Reborn, this paper chronicled the long struggle of the working class against, as Obama put it, 'plutocratic thugs with one hand on the money and the other on the government.'


""In the paper, in which only the first ten pages were given to the general media, Obama decries the plight of the poor: 'I see poverty in every place I walk. In Los Angeles and New York, the poor reach to me with bleary eyes and all I can do is sigh.'


""In part, the future President blames this on the current economic system: 'There are many who will defend the 'free market.' But who will defend the single mother of four working three jobs. When a system is allowed to be free at the expense of its citizens, then it is tyranny.'


""However, the President also singled out the American Constitution: '... the Constitution allows for many things, but what it does not allow is the most revealing. The so-called Founders did not allow for economic freedom. While political freedom is supposedly a cornerstone of the document, the distribution of wealth is not even mentioned. While many believed that the new Constitution gave them liberty, it instead fitted them with the shackles of hypocrisy.'


""It is yet unknown if more of this thesis will be released. It was also noted that the President received an A- for the paper, which later led to his graduation.""


The blog posting gained credibility because the ""satire"" label was small and easy to miss, and it falsely claimed that

Time

magazine columnist Joe Klein uncovered the thesis.


""With all of the secrecy regarding the President's academic record,"" the blogger wrote, ""famed

Time

reporter Joe Klein looked into the records for an upcoming special edition about the President. Klein included several key points in the piece, including his grades and stellar letters of recommendation. However, what has leaked along with this information was the subject of a thesis written by the young Obama while still an undergraduate at Columbia.""


Avitabile said he intended the item to be satire, but not over-the-top-obvious satire.


""If you have to explain a joke, it's not funny,"" he said. ""I kind of get inspiration from Jonathan Swift's

A Modest Proposal.

You want people to be let in and then at the end, they realize it, and either find it funny on its own terms or find their reaction to be funny.""


The satire was too subtle for many people, though. The item appeared to go unnoticed for weeks. Then, on Oct. 21, 2009, Michael Ledeen of Pajamas Media,


a political blog, wrote about Obama's alleged thesis:


""That’s quite an indictment, even for an Ivy League undergraduate. I wonder if the prof – and I’d like to know who the prof was – made an appropriate marginal comment, something about historical context, about the Constitution’s revolutionary status in the history of freedom, and about the separation of powers in order to make the creation of any 'shackles' as difficult as possible.""


Just two days later, on Oct. 23, Rush Limbaugh cited it it in a sharp attack on Obama.


""The Constitution is the most liberty-promoting and freedom-acknowledging document in the history of the world, and this little boy in college is writing about it with utter disdain, and he still shares those feelings,"" Limbaugh told listeners. He added, ""So Joe Klein at

Time

magazine has known for a long time about Obama's college thesis when he was at Columbia. Why didn't this come out a year ago at this time? Why didn't this come out before the election in November?""


Within minutes, though, the story began falling apart. While he was still on air, Limbaugh received notice from a listener who was skeptical of the thesis story and found nothing to back it up. So the host began to backtrack.


""I'm also told that the blog containing the passage on Obama's thesis is a satire blog,"" he said later in the same show. ""So I shout from the mountaintops, 'It was satire!' But we know [Obama] thinks it. Good comedy, to be comedy, must contain an element of truth, and we know how he feels about distribution of wealth. He's mad at the courts for not going far enough on it. So we stand by the fabricated quote because we know Obama thinks it anyway. That's how it works in the media today.""


Klein later confirmed on

Time's

Swampland


blog that he had ""never seen Obama's thesis,"" and other bloggers followed with contrite apologies.


""I should have picked up some hint, but I didn’t,"" Ledeen posted on Oct. 23. ""Shame on me.""


Meredith Jessup of TownHall.com


followed suit the same day, but she added, ""it's important to note that none of this nonsense would be running wild around the Internet if the campaign had just released Obama's thesis in the first place.""


Which might be a fair question – if there had been a thesis at all. But there wasn't. A Columbia University spokesman told PolitiFact that ""an undergraduate thesis requirement for those in political science did not even exist at Columbia in 1983."" In other words, Obama couldn't have written a thesis because no Columbia political science student in his era did. Yet the conviction that a thesis is out there has driven critics to search everywhere for it.


The elusive Obama ""thesis,"" it seems, stems from in an inadvertent slip of the tongue by one of Obama's former professors.


In 2007, when Obama was serving in the Senate and gearing up for the first presidential primaries and caucuses,

New York Times

reporter Janny Scott assembled a story about Obama's years in New York, including his time as an undergraduate at Columbia. She managed to track down Michael Baron, who had taught a senior seminar on international politics and American policy for eight students, including Obama, in 1983.


Baron, now a digital media executive for a Sarasota-based company, mistakenly used the term ""thesis"" when he spoke with the

New York Times

reporter, which sent reporters scurrying to find it.


""Journalists began hounding Columbia University for copies of the musty document,"" wrote Jim Popkin, an NBC News senior investigative producer in a July 2008 blog posting. ""Conservative bloggers began wondering if the young Obama had written a no-nukes screed that he might come to regret. And David Bossie, the former congressional investigator and 'right-wing hit man,' as one newspaper described him, took out classified newspaper ads in Columbia University’s newspaper and the

Chicago Tribune

in March searching for the term paper.""


But Obama's paper was nowhere to be found. While the paper was the fruit of a yearlong course, it's not something the university would have saved. ""It was not like a master's or doctoral thesis that gets collected and put on microfiche,"" Baron told PolitiFact.


Baron, who donated to Obama's campaign, ultimately received about two dozen calls from journalists, some from as far away as Japan and Europe, about the missing ""thesis."" The former professor insists that there was nothing damaging in the 25- to 40-page paper on nuclear disarmament, which earned Obama an A, and certainly nothing about shortcomings of the Constitution or the distribution of wealth, as the blog post indicated. ""The students did not write papers about a policy being good or bad,"" Baron said. ""It was about decisionmaking — who should be listened to and how to avoid narrow thinking.""


Avitabile, asked whether he would continue to publish satire on his site, gave an unequivocal yes. And he urged readers of all blogs to be vigilant. ""I encourage anyone who's on the Internet, make sure it's linked to an accredited news source,"" he said. ""If you do pass it along, you should say, 'This is probably fake, but this says the president is a lizard.""


So once again, satire from Jumping in Pools has triggered an avalanche of unwarranted outrage. And so for the many bloggers who spread the incorrect information, we set the meter ablaze – Pants on Fire. And check your facts next time, okay?

Who is allowed on health insurance exchange? Senate bill keeps it limited
","Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., appeared on  This Week with George Stephanopoulos  to discuss health care reform and the concerns of moderate Democrats that it not add to the deficit. McCaskill said she supported a public option for health insurance and believed that it would end up as part of the final plan. The public option would be one plan among many private plans available on a health insurance exchange, she said. ""Keep in mind, not everybody can even go to this exchange and buy insurance with any kind of subsidy. This is going to be a fairly limited number of people — 25 million to 30 million are the estimates — that would even be on this insurance exchange. By and large, most of this country is going to continue to get their health insurance through their employer."" We were interested in McCaskill's statement because we've been following the legislation to see who would be allowed onto the exchange. To go over a few health care reform basics: The Democratic plans would leave in place the current system of private insurance, which covers a majority of Americans. The plans would also increase regulation for insurance companies, require everyone to buy health insurance and provide more subsidies for low-income people. People who are uninsured or work for a small business would be able to buy coverage on the exchange, which would offer a variety of plans. One aspect still up in the air is the public option, a plan on the exchange that would be run by the government. People could choose whether to enroll in the public option. McCaskill said that only a limited number of people would be eligible to shop on the exchange, and that is the case with the proposal approved by the Senate Finance Committee. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analyzed the committee bill and found that between 23 million and 27 million would buy insurance from the exchange by 2019. The CBO said that most of the people using the exchange would be people who buy insurance on their own in the individual market, and employees who work for small businesses. The CBO also looked at the House bill, a slightly different plan, and found that 30 million would use the exchange in 2019. (We should note that the Senate Finance Committee proposal did not include a public option, but it's expected that the full Senate will consider a public option of some type.) Not everybody likes the limitation on who can shop on the exchange. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., for example, has been promoting an amendment that would open the exchange to people who get insurance from a large employer. ""Under the nation's current employer-based system, most people have little if any choice about where they get their insurance,"" Wyden wrote in an op-ed in the  New York Times.  ""They just have to accept the plan that comes with their job. That insurance company, in turn, is provided a captive group of customers, so it has no incentive to earn their loyalty."" We should also note that President Barack Obama was fond of saying on the campaign trail that people could buy insurance on a new exchange ""if you don't have insurance, or don't like your insurance."" He mentioned it as recently as June in remarks to the American Medical Association: ""Now, if you don't like your health coverage or you don't have any insurance at all, you'll have a chance under what we've proposed to take part in what we're calling a health insurance exchange,"" Obama said to the AMA on June 15, 2009. But that wouldn't be the case under the terms of the Senate Finance proposal, which was unveiled in September. Keep in mind that health care legislation has yet to be finalized, so we'll be keeping an eye on this provision. Getting back to McCaskill's remark, she said that it would be ""a fairly limited number of people — 25 million to 30 million are the estimates — that would even be on this insurance exchange. By and large, most of this country is going to continue to get their health insurance through their employer."" The Congressional Budget Office analyzed the Senate bill and pegged it at 23 million to 27 million by 2019, slightly less than the 30 million the CBO estimated under the House bill. Roughly speaking, that's less than 10 percent of the U.S. population. McCaskill is off by just a little bit on the Senate version and on the money for the House bill. So we rate her statement True.",/factchecks/2009/oct/26/claire-mccaskill/who-is-allowed-health-insurance-exchange/

Gov. Charlie Crist says he has reduced the size of state government
","With conservative Marco Rubio nipping at his heels in the race for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist is trying to pump up his conservative credentials. In a new radio advertisement for his campaign, he says, ""Here in Florida, I’ve slashed government by 10 percent. That’s $7 billion."" It’s a statement Crist has also made on the campaign trail, and at a Hillsborough County Republican Party fundraiser earlier this month. It’s true that Florida’s budget has dropped by 10 percent, or about $7 billion, since Crist was elected governor in November 2006. The budget passed by the Legislature and approved by then-Gov. Jeb Bush in May 2006 came in at $73.9 billion. This year’s spending plan tops out at $66.5 billion. But can Crist, as his radio ad claims, really take credit for the cuts? In 2007, Crist did veto $459 million from the state budget, setting a state record with his veto pen. But the Florida Constitution requires that state lawmakers prepare a balanced budget, which is built around revenue generated by sales taxes, corporate taxes, other taxes and fees, and federal appropriations. And since 2007, that revenue has declined significantly as the nationwide recession has taken hold. State budget documents show that in the 2006-2007 fiscal year, $31.7 billion was available in the general revenue fund. This year, the fund had only $21.9 billion. (In fiscal year 2007, the fund had $28 billion, and in 2008, it had $24.3 billion.) With revenue down and a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget, Crist had to either cut spending or raise taxes. ""This is not a concerted effort on the part of our governor and Legislature to cut the budget,"" said Dominic M. Calabro, president and CEO of Florida TaxWatch. ""It is because of the worst economy Florida has had since the Great Depression."" Crist has defended the budget-cut claim by saying that in other states, taxes were increased to cover shortfalls. While Crist didn’t push for tax increases to make up the entire shortfall, he did approve fee and tax increases this year — on everything from fishing licenses to initial vehicle registrations to cigarettes — that total $2.2 billion. So while it is true that state government has shrunk by 10 percent since Crist’s election, it had little to do with him, and a lot to do with the shrinking economy. For those reasons, we give Crist’s statement a Barely True.",/factchecks/2009/oct/26/charlie-crist/gov-charlie-crist-says-he-has-reduced-size-state-g/

White House spokesman Robert Gibbs fires back at Cheney over troop levels in Afghanistan
","
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs fired back at former Vice President Dick Cheney the day after Cheney said President Barack Obama ""seems afraid to make a decision"" about a general's public plea for 40,000 more U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
 
""The White House must stop dithering while America's armed forces are in danger,"" Cheney said in a speech at the Center for Security Policy on Oct. 21.
 
In his daily press briefing the next day, Gibbs said Cheney's comments were ""curious"" given that ""the vice president was for seven years not focused on Afghanistan.""
 
And, Gibbs said, the comments were ""even more curious given the fact that (a request for) an increase in troops sat on desks in this White House, including the vice president's, for more than eight months, a resource request filled by President Obama in March.""
 
Gibbs is referring here to a request for additional troops made by the previous top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David McKiernan, during President George W. Bush's final year in office.
 
McKiernan made his requests public in a press conference in September 2008 in Afghanistan, saying he needed at least three more combat brigades, in addition to the one Bush had promised in January. He said more soldiers and resources were needed to stabilize insurgencies in Afghanistan.
 
""The danger is that we'll be here longer and we'll expend more resources and experience more human suffering than if we had more resources placed against this campaign sooner,"" McKiernan told reporters.
 
""The additional military capabilities that have been asked for are needed as quickly as possible,"" he said.
 
McKiernan said then that the Pentagon validated his formal request for additional troops, and that his request dated back to when he replaced his predecessor four months prior.
 
In a news briefing at the Pentagon on Oct. 1, 2008, McKiernan reiterated his call for more troops — ""the level of effort needs to be increased"" — and said he was hoping to see a shift of assets from Iraq to Afghanistan.


""I know that's a choice that has to be made here in Washington,"" he said.
 
""I think there's a common view that we need to do more; that Afghanistan has been an economy of force for the last several years,"" McKiernan said.   
 
On Feb. 17, 2009, Obama ordered the deployment of an additional 17,000 soldiers to Afghanistan.
 
According to a story in the

Baltimore Sun

on Feb. 18, 2009, ""The deployment is Obama's response to a long-standing request from commanders in Afghanistan for more troops. The commanders have sought four more combat brigades, aviation units and other support, representing an increase of more than 20,000 troops.""
 
In a March speech outlining a new strategy for the war there, Obama said that ""for six years, Afghanistan has been denied the resources that it demands because of the war in Iraq.""
 
Obama then seemed to take a swipe at the Bush administration when he added that he ordered the additional troops to satisfy a request that came from Gen. McKiernan ""for many months.""
 
The public doesn't have access to McKiernan's formal request for more troops. But we know that he was talking about it publicly in September 2008, at least 4 1/2 months before the end of Bush's term. And McKiernan told reporters his request went back nearly to the start of his taking over as the top U.S. commander four months before that. That would suggest Gibbs' claim is correct that it had been sitting on desks in the White House for eight months. And so we rule his statement True.

Cheney accuses Obama of telling allies of canceled projects in ""midnight"" calls
","
Former Vice President Dick Cheney made news on Oct. 21, 2009, when he accused the White House of ""dithering while America's armed forces are in danger"" in Afghanistan. That was just one of many fireballs he lobbed at the Obama administration’s policies on Iran, Iraq and the interrogation of suspected terrorists.

 

Cheney also rapped the White House for sloppy diplomacy in its decision to cancel a planned missile-defense radar in the Czech Republic and planned missile interceptors in Poland. The administration decided that the facilities were designed with a less-severe threat – long range missiles – in mind, and that missile-defense efforts should instead be focused on countering short- and medium-range missiles.

 

Work on the missile-defense facilities – which had prompted strenuous opposition from Russia and mixed feelings by residents of the two Eastern European countries – was conceived during the tenure of Cheney and President George W. Bush. So Cheney’s opposition to Obama’s canceling the project was not surprising.

 

However, in his speech, Cheney went beyond the substance of the decision and accused the White House of bumbling diplomatic protocol in making its announcement.

 

""It is certainly not a model of diplomacy when the leaders of Poland and the Czech Republic are informed of such a decision at the last minute in midnight phone calls,"" Cheney told an awards dinner sponsored by the Center for Security Policy, a conservative group. ""It took a long time and lot of political courage in those countries to arrange for our interceptor system in Poland and the radar system in the Czech Republic. Our Polish and Czech friends are entitled to wonder how strategic plans and promises years in the making could be dissolved, just like that – with apparently little, if any, consultation. Seventy years to the day after the Soviets invaded Poland, it was an odd way to mark the occasion.""

 

In this item, we will try to determine the timing of when the Obama administration told the Czech Republic and Poland of the decision.

 

According to many news accounts, Czech Prime Minister Jan Fischer was indeed told shortly after midnight, Warsaw time, on Thursday, Sept. 17, 2009. (That is, indeed, the 70th anniversary of the Soviet invasion.)

 

""Just after midnight I was informed,"" Fischer said, according to the

Independent

, a British newspaper. The Russian newspaper

Vremya Novostey

pinpointed the call to 12:21 in the morning.

 

A call received at 12:21 a.m. in Warsaw would have been placed six hours earlier – 6:21 p.m. in Washington.


News of the decision began to leak out the following morning, Washington time. CNN, for example, reported the decision in its 9 a.m. block of

CNN Newsroom

. Obama announced it at 10:21 a.m. in a brief address in the White House’s Diplomatic Reception Room.


So, the time between Obama’s call to Fischer and the formal White House announcement was about 16 hours, most of which was nighttime in one country or the other.


Pinning down the time that Obama contacted Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is a little trickier.


According to Agence France Presse

,

the Czech leader said that Poland ""had been informed in the same way"" as he himself had been. But the Russian paper,

Vremya Novostey

, citing ""Polish news media reports,"" said that a ""technical"" glitch prevented Obama from speaking to Tusk late Wednesday night, so the conversation ""took place only [on Thursday] afternoon."" (We presume that is Warsaw time.)


If Obama did finally make personal contact with Tusk that late, it still would have been before the formal White House announcement, though barely.


The White House declined to provide additional details about the timing.


By way of context, it’s worth noting that the announcement was not exactly a surprise.


After Obama's announcement, Fischer himself said that ""we knew the United States was reviewing its plan to build the radar ... within a reassessment of specific threats, and that one option might be to give up the plan to build the radar,"" according to Agence France Presse

.

""The threats now rest in short- and medium-range missiles, not long-range ones. The American side decided this was the most serious threat and this is their reaction.""

 

It's not clear why the White House chose to make the announcement when it did. Obama still had six days left if he wanted to get the news out before world leaders arrived in New York for the United Nations General Assembly.


Asked by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, at a Senate Armed Services hearing whether the announcement could have been handled any better, undersecretary of defense Michele Flournoy blamed leak-fueled speculation.

 

''We too would have preferred a longer period for consultation and rollout, but leaks and speculation in the press sort of forced us to go sooner to set the record straight,'' she said.

 

As for Cheney's statement, he's definitely right about Fischer, the Czech leader, being contacted about midnight. And although there is a discrepency about the time of the final notification for Poland, the reports indicate that Obama first tried about midnight. So we find Cheney's claim to be True.

Crist makes a misleading claim about a Florida health care plan

""Just good, aggressive negotiating by our administration with health insurance companies. ... And, really, the problem with health care is that it's expensive. And so what we've attempted to do is reduce the cost by reducing the expense and the premium of health insurance, and we've had success doing so. Usually it's about $900 a month to get health coverage. We've reduced that, on average, to about $150 a month.""     Given all the debate over the high cost of health care, we wondered if the Florida plan could be as inexpensive as Crist claims. We found he was distorting the savings by mixing apples and oranges. The program, which was started in 2008, allows individuals who have been without coverage for at least six months to pick from plans offered by six insurance companies. Each provider was chosen by the state through a competitive bidding process, and each offers at least two options — one with catastrophic and hospital coverage, and another plan that can provide less coverage.     The program's  Web site  says that individual plans can be purchased for as little as $23 or as much as $800 a month, depending on age, gender and level of coverage. Patients pick and choose between various options offered through the six insurers. So, for example, a woman who is between 19 and 29 years of age can pay $130 a month for a plan that includes no deductible, $10 copays for doctor visits, but no hospital inpatient coverage.     Since Cover Florida Health Care was enacted, critics have said the program hasn't done enough to cover the uninsured. To date, about 4,500 people have enrolled — about 0.1 percent of the state's uninsured population.     The low-cost options so often touted by state officials don't offer patients much of a safety net, said Florida state Sen. Nan Rich.     ""People are beginning to see that it doesn't cover anything,"" said Rich, a Democrat from Broward County. ""It may be inexpensive, but it's inexpensive for a reason. It's a very low level of coverage.""     When we asked Crist's office about his claim — that health care costs are on average $900 a month compared to $150 under Florida's plan — we were told that the $900 figure cited by the governor came from the Kaiser Family Foundation and that it refers to the amount of money a family pays, on average, per month. Crist's office also noted that the figure is outdated (for instance, in 2006, the average monthly cost per family was about $950) and pointed us to a new Kaiser report released Sept. 15, 2009, that estimates families now pay about $1,114 a month.     So Crist is off by about $200 for  family  coverage.     As for the average cost under the Cover Florida program, Crist's office pointed us to a  document  that lists the different providers and their rates for individuals. The average for the higher-end coverage, which would include hospitalization and catastrophic insurance, is about $227, while the average for the less-expensive ""preventive"" plan was $89. So Crist's $150 number is the approximate average of the two.   But wait. The first number Crist cited is the Kaiser estimate for a  family  . The second number is for an  individual  .   We went back to the Kaiser report and found that the average cost for an individual plan is actually around $400 a month, which would mean the gap was not as dramatic as Crist claimed.   Crist spokesman Sterling Ivey acknowledged the apples and oranges comparison but said the underlying point is still valid that the Florida average is lower.   But we find Crist is using sleight-of-hand, comparing numbers that aren't comparable. He's used a higher family number with a lower number for individuals. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2009/oct/23/charlie-crist/crist-makes-misleading-claim-about-florida-health-/
