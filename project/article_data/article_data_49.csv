Joe Manchin gets it wrong about states with low minimum wages
","Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., played a pivotal role in derailing inclusion of a $15 minimum wage in the American Rescue Plan, President Joe Biden’s coronavirus and economic relief bill. On March 7, four days before the measure was signed into law, Manchin reiterated his opposition to raising the federal minimum wage as high as $15, a level Biden and many congressional Democrats had originally sought to include in the bill. In an interview on ABC’s ""This Week,"" Manchin said he supports raising the minimum wage to $11 an hour, but not as high as $15. ""The bottom line is there is not one senator out of 100 that doesn't want to raise the minimum wage,"" Manchin said. ""$7.25 is sinfully low. We must raise it."" Manchin went on to say that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., ""has chosen $15 and, you know what, an awful lot of areas and states have moved to $15. A lot of them moved a lot further than $7.25."" But Manchin continued, ""There’s very few, I would think, if any, are at $7.25."" His assessment was far off base. According to the federal Labor Department, 21 states have a minimum wage equal to the federal level of $7.25: Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. That’s more than 40% of states, not a ""few."" Manchin’s own state, West Virginia, has a rate that’s only slightly higher than the federal minimum, $8.75. We should note that several states have set a path to move toward a $15 minimum wage. They include California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and the District of Columbia. But in these states, the $15 rate will be phased in over several years, and none has reached that level yet.  We reached out to Manchin’s office but did not hear back. Manchin said that ""there’s very few, I would think, if any (states that) are at $7.25"" for their minimum wage. In reality, 21 states have a minimum wage that’s equal to the federal minimum wage of $7.25.

Biden urging COVID-19 safety, but has not said he might ban July 4th gatherings
","On March 11, President Joe Biden said that if Americans followed COVID-19 safety guidelines, there was a ""good chance"" they could gather in ""small groups"" to celebrate the Fourth of July. On April 21, Biden hailed the progress of vaccinations and again looked ahead to Independence Day — but his remarks were depicted by some as a heavy-handed warning rather than a ray of hope. ""Joe Biden says Americans can only celebrate the 4th of July if he says so,"" read a Facebook post by conservative commentator Benny Johnson. ""Americans respond!"" The post included a four-minute video that begins with Johnson saying: ""Joe Biden says you can’t celebrate the Fourth of July unless you’ve been a good little boy and girl, unless you’ve gotten your Fauci-ouchie, your vaccine, and gee whiz, he might let you have a small, teeny little gathering in your backyard — if you follow his directions. What a scumbag tyrant.""  Later in the video, a 20-second clip is shown of Biden saying: ""To celebrate our independence from this virus on July Fourth, with family and friends in small groups, we still have more to do in the months of May and June. We all need to mask up until the number of cases goes down, until everyone has a chance to get their shot."" Johnson’s post and others like it were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biden has not said that he might cancel or ban Fourth of July celebrations.  The clip is taken from remarks Biden made April 21 about COVID-19. But he first referenced the Fourth of July on March 11, in a prime-time address. In that speech, Biden announced he was directing all states to make all adults eligible for a vaccine by May 1 and was accelerating efforts to reopen schools. He also implored Americans to get vaccinated. Then he referenced Independence Day, saying: ""If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this together, by July the Fourth, there’s a good chance you, your families and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day. That doesn’t mean large events with lots of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together."" In his April 21 remarks, Biden announced that his goal of administering 200 million COVID-19 shots during his first 100 days in office had been met. He closed his remarks referring to the Fourth of July, saying: ""Back on March 11th, I outlined a vision of what America could look like by the Fourth of July — an America that was much closer to normal life that we left behind more than a year ago. We remain on track for that goal.  ""In the weeks since then, more than 120 million shots have been given since I announced the July Fourth proposal.  More of our kids are back in school. And after a long and painful year, more grandparents are able to hug their grandkids again. It’s great progress.  ""But if we let up now and stop being vigilant, this virus will erase the progress we’ve already achieved, the sacrifices we’ve made, the lives that have been put on hold, the loved ones who’ve been taken from us, the time we’re never going to get back.  ""To celebrate our independence from this virus on July Fourth, with family and friends in small groups, we still have more to do in the months of May and June. We all need to mask up until the number of cases goes down, until everyone has a chance to get their shot. ""To Americans 16 years and older, it’s your turn now. Now.  So, go get your vaccine before the end of May. We can do this. And we’ll do this as long as we don’t let up."" On April 27, the day after Johnson’s post, Biden said: ""Next week, I’ll be laying out the path ahead to continue our fight against COVID-19 to get us to July Fourth. ...While we still have a long way to go in this fight and a lot of work to do in May and June to get us to July Fourth, we’ve made stunning progress because of all of you, the American people. Cases and deaths are down — down dramatically from where they were when I took office on January 20th, and continuing to fall."" A Facebook post claimed: ""Joe Biden says Americans can only celebrate the Fourth of July if he says so."" Biden in March said that if Americans followed COVID-19 safety guidelines, there was a ""good chance"" they could gather in ""small groups"" to celebrate the Fourth of July.

No proof for another pro-Trump claim of thousands of illegal votes in Georgia
","Attacks on the integrity of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia have been as persistent as head lice, yet they don’t seem to stick. A sampling of our fact-checks: ""Suitcases filled with ballots pulled from under a table and illegally counted."" False. 132,000 ballots ""likely ineligible."" False. Donald Trump says the secretary of state won’t let the people recounting ballots check the signatures for fraud. Pants on Fire.  Now, more than five months after the election, and after two recounts confirmed that Trump narrowly lost Georgia to Joe Biden, another attack has surfaced.  An April 21 article from the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, carried this headline about what it calls an election integrity organization: ""Elections Integrity Org Identifies 12,547 Illegal Votes Included In Georgia's 2020 Election Results - Exceeds Margin of Victory In the State."" The claim, widely circulated on Facebook and elsewhere online, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) What the organization, a group of former Trump campaign staff members, posted online merely makes more claims of balloting irregularity in Georgia, without producing data to back the claims. The Gateway Pundit article claims that an April 19 report from an organization called Look Ahead America found 12,547 illegal ballots cast in Georgia, exceeding Biden’s margin of victory of 11,779. Biden was the first Democrat to win Georgia since 1992. Look Ahead America says it was formed by members of Trump’s campaign staff, and is led by former Trump campaign staffer Matt Braynard, to ""register, educate and enfranchise"" citizens who are disaffected.  A summary of the Look Ahead America report claims illegal ballots were cast in the names of people who voted using early and absentee ballots: 1,056 voters who allegedly were registered illegally. The summary claims the names of voters were matched against ""known lists of postal box facilities — FedEx, UPS, etc. — and similar addresses where individuals could not live."" 10,651 ballots allegedly were cast illegally based on matching names of voters to ""permanent, out-of-state moves"" in the U.S. Postal Service’s national change of address database. 840 ballots allegedly were cast illegally based on matching names of voters who the report claims registered to vote in another state after registering in Georgia.   ""There's not enough in that public report to confirm or dispute anything, and that seems to be their goal,"" said Matthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. The summary recycles claims that are ""nothing but innuendo and speculation,"" said Ari Schaffer, spokesperson for the Georgia Secretary of State. He noted that Trump’s campaign in January dropped four lawsuits it had filed in Georgia making unsubstantiated allegations about ineligible voters and fraud and seeking to overturn the election result in the state. David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, also called the new claims a rehash. He said that ""rather than subject these claims to judicial scrutiny and cross-examination, they voluntarily dismissed their claims"" in court. Look Ahead America says an ""unredacted version"" of its report with full data is being provided to ""government officials and select journalists and other individuals upon request."" We asked Braynard for the full report. He replied with only a link to a February tweet he posted about one of our fact-check articles that mentioned him. In January, PolitiFact rated False a claim by Trump that 4,925 voters from out-of-state voted in Georgia in the 2020 presidential election. It appeared Trump got his number from Braynard, who arrived at the number by comparing Georgia registration and voting lists with the U.S. Postal Service change-of-address data. Braynard’s analysis was criticized by statisticians and election experts for failing to meet scientific standards of evidence.  In December, FactCheck.org found that a report by Braynard claiming that 20,312 people who no longer met residency requirements cast ballots in Georgia was not credible. A headline widely shared on Facebook claimed a group ""identifies 12,547 illegal votes"" in Georgia's 2020 election results, ""exceeds margin of victory in the state."" The number is larger than Biden’s margin of victory over Trump in Georgia.

Under new Virginia law, a pound of pot will bring a $25 fine
","No Republican in the General Assembly voted for a coming law on July 1 that will legalize possession of an ounce of marijuana in Virginia. Beyond the legalization, their list of objections includes what they say are light penalties for people possessing much more than an ounce of the drug. ""You can have up to one pound with only a $25 fine,"" Del. Kirk Cox, a GOP candidate for governor, said during an April 7 radio interview on WRVA in Richmond. Let’s put this in perspective. There’s a lot of debate over how many joints can be made from an ounce. The Drug and Alcohol Dependence journal has estimated about 84. A 2011 academic study estimated about 43. So according to these widely cited estimates, there’s somewhere between 688 and 1,344 joints in a pound - a large personal stash. We wondered whether Cox is right that possession of a pound of pot will be punished with ""only a $25 fine"" when the law takes effect on July 1. Turns out, he is. The law establishes anyone 21 or older can legally possess as much as one ounce. It says anyone having more than that is ""subject to a civil penalty of no more than $25."" Anyone possessing more than one pound in public could be found guilty of a felony and face a prison sentence of up to 10 years. The law is silent on whether a person could have more than a pound in their home.  Marijuana already has been legalized in 15 states. Virginia and two other states have passed laws that will go into effect midyear. Most of the states allow possession of an ounce or less without penalty. But come July 1, Virginia will have by far the most lenient law in the nation for possession of a pound of pot, according to our analysis of state laws posted by NORML, a national organization seeking to decriminalize cannabis. Virginia will be the only state where possession of a pound is not a crime, and its $25 civil fine - which can be prepaid - will be the country’s least-expensive maximum penalty. Outside of Virginia, possession of a pound of marijuana is: A felony in 26 states, misdemeanor in 20, and categorized simply as a crime in three; Punishable by prison or jail sentences in 47 states; Subject to maximum $500 fines in six states and higher fines in the rest. Jenn Michelle Pedini, executive director of Virginia NORML, offered no objections to Cox’s statement, and said the amount of pot that will qualify for a civil fine in Virginia is ""a lot."" Democrats and Gov. Ralph Northam were urgent to pass the bill this year to end racial disparity in Virginia for marijuana arrests. Black Virginians are 3.5 times more likely to be arrested than whites for possession of the drug, according to a report by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission on Virginia pot arrests from 2009-2019.  Under the law, people under 21 caught with a pound of cannabis or less would pay a $25 fine, but also have to enter a substance abuse treatment and education program. It will remain illegal to sell or barter pot. Possession of more than a pound will remain a felony. The 283-page law also legalizes state-regulated retail sales of marijuana starting in 2024. Many aspects of the complex regulatory framework will have to be approved again next year by the General Assembly. Many Republicans, including Cox, said the law is rash. Pedini supports the goals in the bill, but said legislators needed more time this year to work on it. ""I don’t think it’s properly structured,"" Pedini said. ""I don’t think it will remain the way it is."" Northam signed the bill at an April 21 ceremony. ""This is the latest step we are taking to building a more equitable and just Virginia,"" he said. Our ruling Cox says that under Virginia’s new marijuana laws, effective July 1, ""You can have up to one pound with only a $25 fine.""

Tillis doesn't tell full story about Biden 'amnesty' bill
","U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis says President Joe Biden has failed to live up to his promises on immigration. The North Carolina Republican goes even further in a recent Fox News op-ed, arguing that Biden attempted to grant ""mass amnesty"" to immigrants in the country illegally. ""One of his first acts in office was sending an immigration bill to Congress to grant mass amnesty to illegal immigrants,"" Tillis wrote. While the op-ed doesn’t specify the bill Tillis is referring to, his office cited the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021. So, is Tillis right about Biden’s bill?  Most experts hesitate to label Biden’s bill as granting ""mass amnesty"" because it requires immigrants to meet certain criteria along their pathway to citizenship. And while the legislation does appear to open a wider gate than previous legalization efforts, the term ""amnesty"" is squishy, having been loosely defined and debated for many years. Biden’s bill is more lenient than the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" proposal in the Senate that gained momentum in 2013. However, experts didn’t agree on whether it’s more lenient than a law enacted in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan, which is considered the modern standard for amnesty bills. Biden’s plan offers what the U.S. News & World Report described as a ""two-tier"" pathway to citizenship. A three-year path to citizenship would be available for some farmworkers, immigrants who arrived here illegally when they were children (known as ""Dreamers"") and people who currently benefit from a Temporary Protected Status designation. The expedited path could affect 3 million people, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. An eight-year path to citizenship would be available for all undocumented immigrants living in the United States at the start of 2021. In total, the bill could affect as many as 11 million immigrants. All immigrants would be required to pay taxes and pass background checks. The bill takes a more comprehensive approach to immigration than previous proposals because it also seeks to reduce visa backlogs, eliminate per-country admission caps, get rid of the one-year deadline for filing asylum claims and expand access to some visas. If enacted into law, it would fulfill Biden’s promise to create ""a roadmap to citizenship for the nearly 11 million people who have been living in and strengthening our country for years."" So, does it call for ""mass amnesty?"" Amnesty is a loose term that PolitiFact has explored dozens of times. We consulted six experts on the issue. They said the word is used so often and so excessively it’s almost devoid of a specific meaning.  Tillis’ office says the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 meets the definition of amnesty outlined by a researcher for the Center for Immigration Studies, in a previous fact check about Tillis’ SUCCEED Act. Steven Camarota, whose group pushes for more limits on immigration, said amnesty basically refers to forgiveness for a crime (meaning Tillis’ SUCCEED Act could qualify as amnesty, despite having stringent citizenship requirements). It’s important to note though that the simple act of being in the United States illegally is not necessarily a crime. As PolitiFact has noted before, one legal definition of amnesty is that of ""a blanket abolition of an offense by the government, with the legal result that those charged or convicted have the charge or conviction wiped out."" Meanwhile, experts have told us the immigration law signed by President Reagan in 1986 often serves as the standard for what qualifies as amnesty. The Immigration Reform and Control Act, or IRCA, said anyone who had been in the country continuously for about four years when the bill was signed into law, who paid a $185 fine and back taxes and who demonstrated ""good moral character"" would be granted legal status. Ultimately, the law allowed about 2.7 million people to get green cards. So, how does Biden’s plan compare to other proposals? Experts say it’s more lenient than the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" proposal that attained notoriety in 2013 but never became law. That bill would have created a 13-year pathway to citizenship while also allocating billions of dollars to tighten border security. Is it more lenient than Reagan’s 1986 law? Some experts told us Biden’s law might actually be stricter. Others argue it’s unfair to compare the two, since the immigration issue has changed over the last 30 years. Biden’s proposal is ""much closer to the Gang of Eight bill than to Reagan’s amnesty,"" said David Leopold, a partner with Ulmer and Berne LLP. ""But unlike those bills, Biden’s bill shifts the paradigm by providing a holistic approach,"" Leopold said. ""It addresses the root causes of migration from Central America by promoting rule of law, security and economic development, strengthening the regional humanitarian responses for refugees and asylum seekers and manages the border."" Edward Alden, the Bernard L. Schwartz senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says experts have ""learned an awful lot since IRCA.  ""The Reagan bill was premised on the notion that a one-time legalization would ‘solve’ the illegal immigration problem. But it paid no attention to what was going on in Mexico, and made no provisions for new legal channels, enhanced border security or employment verification,"" Alden said. Ann Lin, associate professor of public policy at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, is one of a couple experts who believe Biden’s bill might in some ways be stricter than Reagan’s law.  Biden’s law ""does allow the primary applicant to apply for his/her immediate family dependants at the same time. In that way it is more generous than the 1986 law,"" Lin said. ""On the other hand, because there's a six year period (to become a permanent resident), those dependents are also likely to face a longer time period between application and permanent residence than the 1986 dependents."" ""In some ways, the U.S. Citizenship Act is similar"" to Reagan’s law, said Kevin R. Johnson, an immigration law expert and dean of the University of California, Davis School of Law. ""However, the proposed act also addresses legal immigration in ways that IRCA did not; the U.S. Citizenship Act has a better chance in my view of allowing many undocumented immigrants to legalize and to avoid the growth of a new undocumented population, like that which occurred after IRCA."" Biden’s plan would ""provide a quite wide path to legal status and eventually citizenship,"" said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. It also ""arguably has fewer requirements than Reagan’s bill."" David Bier, an immigration researcher at the Cato Institute, agreed Biden’s bill ""has fewer requirements than the Reagan bill."" But Gelatt hesitated to use the term amnesty, noting that Biden’s plan requires applicants to ""pay a fee, undergo screening, and pay federal taxes.""  While Reagan’s law required people to ""pay a fee, go through normal screenings, show proof of financial resources to ensure self sufficiency, and, to get a green card, show basic knowledge of English and U.S. history and government,"" the Biden bill includes ""the fee and background checks, but not documentation of self-sufficiency or the extra English/civics requirement.""

Tillis said: ""One of his first acts in office was sending an immigration bill to Congress to grant mass amnesty to illegal immigrants."" It’s fair to say that Biden’s plan would offer a wider path to citizenship than other proposals in recent years.

No proof of military equipment giveaway soaring under Biden, as BLM claimed
","Black Lives Matter activists want President Joe Biden to ban the transfer of military equipment to local police agencies. A renewed push by activists and some lawmakers to halt or rein in the longstanding military transfer program comes in response to a year of protests against police brutality and for racial justice in cities nationwide following the murder of George Floyd.  Black Lives Matter said on Twitter that Biden has ramped up the program to send military equipment into local communities. ""Biden’s first 100 days are up in 10 days. By then we need him to #End1033, which transfers military equipment into the hands of police across the country-- including school & campus police. Another example? The military you see out on your streets ahead of the Chauvin verdict. ""Biden is currently sending more military equipment to our neighborhoods than Trump did. You read that right. Our communities are being terrorized at a greater rate than they had been under Trump."" Biden is currently sending more military equipment to our neighborhoods than Trump did. You read that right. Our communities are being terrorized at a greater rate than they had been under Trump. We sent emails to Black Lives Matter asking for evidence of the claim and did not receive a response. We don’t know if the group was comparing all equipment transfers under the program or only certain types of equipment. It also isn’t clear if it compared Biden’s first quarter in office to any particular time period during Trump’s tenure. We found that comparing the use of the program under Biden to its operation under Trump is problematic. First, Biden has been in office only three months while Trump served for four years. Second, a president has virtually nothing to do with the amount of equipment transferred through the program. Even when past presidents have issued orders related to the program, they have had little control over how much equipment was transferred.  We looked at the quarterly data of equipment transfers in the program and found that it’s wrong to generalize and say Biden is sending more military equipment to neighborhoods than Trump. ""The Black Lives Matter assertions are overbroad,"" said Kevin Govern, a law professor at Ave Maria University and an adjunct instructor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""Some greater perspective than one single quarter in a fiscal year is necessary for a meaningful assessment."" After Floyd was killed in Minneapolis while in police custody, Biden on the campaign trail called for the U.S. to ""stop transferring weapons of war to police forces."" House Democrats wrote a letter in April asking him to issue an executive order to end the transfer of certain military equipment. We asked a White House spokesperson if Biden has any such plans and did not get a response. While Biden could effectively shut down the military equipment program with an order, permanently abolishing it would require an act of Congress, wrote Stephen Semler, cofounder of Security Policy Reform Institute, a U.S. foreign policy think tank. The 1033 program, named for a section of federal law, allows local law enforcement agencies to acquire surplus military equipment from the federal government. This ranges from what the federal government calls ""controlled"" property — weapons, demilitarized vehicles and aircraft and night vision equipment — to general property such as office equipment, first aid kits, hand tools, sleeping bags, computers and toilet paper.  After one year, general property becomes the property of the local law enforcement agency while the controlled property is considered a loan. Supporters of the program say it’s an efficient way for local police agencies to obtain equipment they otherwise couldn’t afford. Law enforcement agencies pay for shipping and potential storage costs, but don’t pay for the property. Critics say that it has led to an excessive militarization of local police agencies and erects barriers between police and local communities. More than 8,000 agencies participate in the program, according to the Defense Logistics Agency, the government body that oversees it. That adds up to less than half the agencies in the country. Using the initial acquisition value, the total amount transferred since the program’s inception in 1990 is $7.4 billion.   Participating law enforcement agencies submit electronic requests to a state coordinator who then routes requests to federal officials for further review. The White House generally isn’t involved in that process, although recent presidents have issued orders related to the program. President Barack Obama in 2015 ordered a review of the program following the police response to protesters in Ferguson, Mo., over the death of Michael Brown. That led to an order to prohibit the transfer of certain equipment such as bayonets, but still left the program largely intact. In 2017, the Trump administration rescinded Obama’s order.  But in reality, these orders by Obama and Trump didn’t change the overall amount of equipment transferred to law enforcement agencies. Patrick Mackin, a spokesperson for the Defense Logistics Agency, said the amount of property transferred is based primarily on how much equipment the military services have turned in for disposal. Historically, the largest transfers happen after deactivations or redeployments of units — such as from Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2012–14. (Govern, the law professor, collected data from the Defense Logistics Agency showing how the acquisition value of transferred equipment soared during part of Obama’s tenure.) The vast majority of the transferred equipment consists of common commercial items. Small arms weapons such as rifles and side-arms normally make up about 5% of the total, while less than 1% of property issued is tactical vehicles. The Defense Logistics Agency provided us a quarterly breakdown of equipment under Biden’s first quarter in office and quarterly data for Trump’s tenure. We decided to focus on the controlled items — the ones that are clearly military equipment. For Biden’s tenure, we received data for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 — January through March, which includes about three weeks of Trump’s presidency.  For that quarter, the data showed that both the number of items police departments received and the acquisition costs for those items were higher than some Trump quarters but lower than others.  The 1033 program is not the only way local agencies obtain such equipment — they can purchase it on their own or through grants from federal agencies. The town of Keene, N.H., home to about 30,000 people, accepted a federal grant in 2012 to purchase an armored truck. Comedian John Oliver later poked fun of the town’s application request, which mentioned the annual pumpkin festival as a potential terrorism target. Black Lives Matter said, ""Biden is currently sending more military equipment to our neighborhoods than Trump did."" We don’t know how Black Lives Matter is comparing Biden’s short tenure to Trump’s presidency. One quarter of a year doesn’t tell us much about how the program has operated under Biden compared with four years of Trump. But what it does show is that the amount of equipment given to local agencies varies from quarter to quarter but was higher in most Trump quarters than in the time period that includes Biden’s presidency. We rate this statement False.

No, a quarter million fraudulent votes weren’t uncovered in an Arizona election audit
","Arizona Senate Republicans have hired contractors to audit the results of the 2020 presidential election in Maricopa County, where some Republicans have made allegations of widespread voter fraud.   These claims have been dismissed in court and proven unsubstantiated by a previous audit of a sample of ballots.  We don’t yet know the results of the audit, which is being led by a company whose founder has shared unfounded conspiracy theories about the election results. However, some social media users are drawing their own conclusions.  ""A quarter of a million illegal votes found in Arizona’s audit...so far!"" said one post that’s being shared widely on Facebook.  ""A quarter of a million illegal votes found in Arizona audit...we told you so,"" another said.

But in response to comments, one of the posters directed readers to a blog post on Worthypolitics.com, which couches the statistic with more uncertainty. The headline says: ""The number of illegal votes in Maricopa County could easily reach more than 250,000 votes."" A graphic embedded in the piece shows what appears to be a breakdown of ""possible illegal votes"" that toal 254,722, or about a quarter million.  We also found the graphic in a clip of a recent recording of the podcast ""War Room,"" which is hosted by Steve Bannon, who was an adviser and strategist for former president Donald Trump. It appears around the 2:28 mark of the video.  Peter Navarro, Trump’s trade adviser, appeared on the April 24 episode of the podcast. He walked Bannon through the information in the graphic, which he described as the results of his own investigation — not the audit underway in Arizona.  ""I did a deep dive on this and identified six different types of election irregularities across the six battleground states,"" he said. ""The possible illegal votes, my investigation uncovered, was 254,722. So that’s 24 times the alleged Biden victory margin so there’s a lot of possible slack in that system and that’s what these forensic folks are gonna be looking for as they count the ballots in Maricopa County."" In December, Navarro put out a report titled ""The Immaculate Deception: Six Key Dimensions of Election Irregularities."" In the summary, he wrote that the report assessed the integrity of the presidential election by ""examining six dimensions of alleged election irregularities across six key battleground states,"" including Arizona. The evidence to conduct this assessment included ""more than 50 lawsuits and judicial rulings,"" ""testimony in a variety of state venues,"" and ""public comments,"" the summary says. Of the lawsuits that Trump and his allies filed seeking to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory, only one prevailed, and it was a case that did not prove that widespread voter fraud affected the outcome of the election. As we’ve previously reported, judges across the political spectrum rejected dozens of cases filed after the Nov. 3 election.  A Washington Post analysis faults Navarro’s report for describing as ""near-certainties things that are unfounded, misrepresented or unimportant"" and relying on ""biased and flawed sources of information.""    In any case, Navarro’s speculation about the election results in the six states does not mean that the audit uncovered a quarter of a million fraudulent votes in Arizona or anywhere else. The Arizona Republic reported on April 26 that auditors have not provided any updates since the audit began.  Cyber Ninjas, the Florida-based technology company that Republican senators hired to oversee the audit, did not respond to our questions about the post.  We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2021/apr/27/facebook-posts/no-quarter-million-fraudulent-votes-werent-uncover/

Building a Better Ohio says Toledo once laid off now-Mayor Mike Bell when the city was out of money
","
Toledo Mayor Mike Bell appears in a TV commercial endorsing Issue 2, the November voter referendum on Senate Bill 5. The ad was made and paid for by Building a Better Ohio, the largely business and Republican-backed political action committee supporting SB 5, the law passed earlier this year that restricts the collective bargaining power of Ohio's public unions.

Bell, who was elected as an independent in 2009, talks in the ad about his support for Issue 2 because it will give communities tools to help control spending and balance budgets without laying off workers or raising taxes.

He starts the discussion saying: ""Years ago, I lost my job as a firefighter because my city ran out of money.""

Building a Better Ohio adopts Bell’s statement as its own on its website.

PolitiFact Ohio took notice. Bell's record and experience make him worth listening to. A firefighter and certified paramedic who went on the job in 1980, he became Toledo's youngest-ever and first African American fire chief in 1990, and held the post for more than 16 years. After he retired, then-Gov. Ted Strickland appointed him State Fire Marshal.

The commercial also stirred our curiosity. Did Bell really lose his job in a budget crunch and was it at all related to labor issues?

So PolitiFact Ohio looked deeper into the record.

Bell was one of 61 Toledo firefighters and 240 total city workers laid off in a budget crisis in 1980, not long after he went on the job. Three fire stations were closed.

But that happened more than three years before the state's current collective bargaining law took effect, so PolitiFact Ohio wondered what relevance SB 5 would have -- a question also raised by unions in Toledo.

According to accounts in The Toledo Blade, the 1980 layoffs followed a 1979 impasse in negotiations between the city and unions (after the final offer of a three-year contract including 2, 1.5 and 1 percent pay raises) that led to a strike by municipal employees, including police and firefighters -- even though the Ferguson Act prohibited strikes by public employees in Ohio and provided for dismissal of strikers.

""What ensued,"" The Blade reported, ""was a 48-hour gap in public safety that allowed mayhem to rule the streets."" Residents armed themselves, and ""countless"" fires were set.

The budget crisis was not resolved until voters in 1982 approved a ""temporary"" increase in the income tax, which has been renewed ever since.

Retired Ohio Supreme Court Justice Andy Douglas was a Toledo councilman helping a bipartisan campaign to pass the tax increase in 1982, and he helped negotiate new safety contracts about two years ago. He told The Blade that Toledo's current budget problems, struggling to afford labor contracts with safety forces, mirror those of 1982.

""The only difference is the magnitude of the number in present-day dollars,"" he said. ""We had exactly the same problems two or three times during my tenure in council.""

In the ad, Bell says he knows Issue 2 ""will give communities the tools they need to get spending under control and balance their budgets without raising taxes on you or laying off good employees.""

PolitiFact Ohio isn’t rating that part of Bell’s statement today. Whether SB 5 is the answer remains hotly debated and we are not examining its merits or flaws.

But the claim that Bell was once laid off as a firefighter is accurate. And it is true that his layoff followed an impasse in labor talks with city workers and a strike.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim about Bell in Building a Better Ohio’s rates True.

Gary Johnson says U.S. is ""bankrupt""
","
At the Sept. 22, 2011 Fox News-Google Republican presidential candidates debate in Orlando, Fla., former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson was asked about U.S.-Cuba policy, but his reply somehow morphed into a frequent subject of Truth-O-Meter rulings: whether the U.S. is bankrupt.. 
Fox News anchor Bret Baier asked, ""Gov. Johnson, here in Florida, charter flights from Ft. Lauderdale to Havana, Cuba, have resumed. Is there a problem with that? And what are your thoughts on U.S.-Cuba policy? 
Johnson responded, ""I think the biggest threat to our national security is the fact that we're bankrupt,"" Johnson said. ""So I am promising to submit a balanced budget to Congress in the year 2013, and included in that is a 43 percent reduction in military spending."" 
Bankrupt? PolitiFact has examined that claim several times, most recently when Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, said it at a debate in Iowa on Aug. 11, 2011. (Oddly, Baier asked the question that time, too.) We rated it False, and we haven’t changed our minds. 
Here, as before, we’re relying on common definitions of ""bankrupt"" that seem to best fit the context of Paul's statement. One is ""declared in law unable to pay outstanding debts."" Another is ""reduced to a state of financial ruin: impoverished."" 
Since the U.S. government hasn't landed in bankruptcy court and been declared unable to pay its bills, we'll simplify it to whether the United States can pay its debts. 
Ratings agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch pay attention to this very question. They offer sovereign credit ratings based on the same standards as your credit score: What's the risk a nation might default on its debt by failing to pay its bills? And S&P did downgrade the country's credit rating on Aug. 5, 2011. 
But what does that mean, exactly? 
The United States had a AAA credit rating, which S&P defines as having ""extremely strong capacity to meet its financial commitments."" It's the highest rating you can get. After the downgrade, the United States has a AA+ credit rating. It's just one notch down from AAA on a scale that has more than 20 notches. S&P now says the United States ""has very strong capacity to meet its financial commitments."" The ""+"" shows that the U.S. rating is on the high side of AA. 
Meanwhile, two other ratings agencies, Moody's and Fitch, didn't change their U.S. ratings — America still has the highest rating they offer. 
Fitch Ratings said on Aug. 2, 2011, that ""despite the heated political debate ... corporate sector balance sheets and profitability are healthy, underlying productivity growth is still relatively strong, and the U.S. dollar remains unchallenged as the global reserve currency."" 
We'll note that the ratings are forward-looking -- they evaluate whether the United States is likely to default in the future. But Johnson, like Paul, went further than that, saying that ""we’re bankrupt"" – in the present tense. 
When we fact-checked Paul’s comment a few weeks ago, we asked the U.S. Treasury: Can the country pay its bills right now? 
Yes, said spokesman Matt Anderson. 
""Because Congress acted to prevent a default crisis, the government has been able to meet its financial obligations,"" he said. 
Meanwhile, he pointed out that the Bureau of Public Debt has had no trouble selling bills, notes and bonds to finance the public debt. 
(We should also note that in addition to using taxes, layoffs, spending cuts and debt shifting to fund its obligations, the federal government as sovereign nation could just print more money, though there are downsides to that approach.) 
Now, about that second definition, ""reduced to a state of financial ruin: impoverished."" 
Allow us an analogy: Your paycheck doesn't cover your bills every month. But you have a great credit score, use your credit card to cover the difference and have no trouble paying your credit card bill. Would you describe yourself as ""bankrupt"" or ""impoverished""? 
We wouldn't. We'd reserve that description for the neighbor who was behind on his mortgage and couldn't pay his creditors. 
Johnson said that ""we’re bankrupt."" For all of our fiscal challenges, we conclude that the United States’ situation doesn’t meet the traditional definitions of that term. So we rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2011/sep/23/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-says-us-bankrupt/

Rick Santorum says Rick Perry provided in-state college tuition for illegal immigrants
","
At the Sept. 22, 2011, Fox News-Google debate in Orlando, Mitt Romney expanded on his disagreement with a Texas law affording some illegal immigrants in-state tuition to public colleges and universities.

Fox News reporter Chris Wallace noted that Romney had vetoed such a proposal when he was governor of Massachusetts. Wallace then asked: ""What about Gov. (Rick) Perry's argument that it's better to get these kids an education and to get them jobs than to consign them just to being a burden on the state?""

""It's an argument I just can't follow,"" Romney replied. ""I've got be honest with you, I don't see how it is that a state like Texas -- to go to the University of Texas, if you're an illegal alien, you get an in-state tuition discount.""

In advance of the debate, we were reviewing another presidential aspirant’s claim about the Texas law. In the Sept. 12 debate in Tampa, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum said Perry had ""provided in-state tuition for -- for illegal immigrants. Maybe that was an attempt to attract the illegal vote -- I mean, the Latino voters. But you attract Latino voters by talking about the importance of immigration in this country.""

Setting aside whether Santorum equated illegal immigrants with Latino Americans, did Perry give a tuition break to people who are in the U.S. illegally?

Perry responded: ""In the state of Texas, if you've been in the state of Texas for three years, if you're working towards your college degree, and if you are working and pursuing citizenship in the state of Texas, you pay in-state tuition there. ... And I'm proud that we are having those individuals be contributing members of our society rather than telling them, ‘You go be on the government dole.’ ""

Indeed, as we noted in a 2010 fact check, Perry proudly signed into law on June 16, 2001, a proposal allowing certain illegal immigrants to attend Texas colleges and universities at in-state tuition rates. Undocumented immigrants with a Texas high school diploma or GED who have lived in Texas for at least three years may qualify for in-state tuition if they sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they can.

From 2002 to 2010, according to the coordinating board, 35,200 students used the affidavit method to attend Texas colleges or universities at in-state tuition rates.The annual number of beneficiaries rose from 733 in 2002 to 16,476 in 2010, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.

And ""affidavit"" students pay far less than what they’d pay as non-residents. On average in 2011, a non-resident, full-time student would be expected to pay an estimated $17,000 in tuition and fees, according to Texas public universities, while an in-state resident would be paying $7,200.

Texas isn’t alone with such a provision. Nationally, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 13 states passed such proposals into law in the wake of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Signed by President Clinton, the act sought to prevent states from giving an in-state tuition benefit to illegal immigrants that is not available to legal residents.

Legislatures in Texas, California and other states responded with measures intended to preserve in-state tuition for some illegal immigrants. Other states banned illegal immigrants from getting in-state tuition rates; Indiana passed such a law last month, as the Indianapolis Star reported Aug. 31.

In Texas, lawmakers approved House Bill 1403 with few ""no"" votes. After signing it into law, Perry said in a speech to the Southwest Voters Registration Education Project that he approved it ""so that young Texans who graduated from our public schools, regardless of their immigration status, will be able to pay in‑state tuition and take part in the Texas Dream. We want bright, new Texans to stay here, and contribute great things to our future.""

Six years later, Perry opposed an attempt to repeal the measure, telling the Houston Chronicle: ""I’m for leaving the law like it is because I think it serves a good purpose."" He reiterated his support during the 2010 Texas gubernatorial campaign.

Perry’s comments at the Sept. 12 and Sept. 22 debates aligned with his previously supportive statements.

All told, Perry isn’t solely responsible for the Texas law enabling illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition, but he signed it into existence and has stood by it. We rate Santorum’s claim as True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/23/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-rick-perry-provided-state-colle/

Mitt Romney repeats claim that Obama went around the world apologizing for the United States
","
In a debate in Orlando on Sept. 22, 2011, Mitt Romney charged that President Obama has gone around the world apologizing for America. 

President Obama ""went around the world and apologized for America,"" Romney said, in response to a question about Israel and the Middle East.

Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has made this charge several times. The first time we checked it was when he made the charge is his own book, No Apology: The Case for American Greatness.

Here’s the claim from Romney’s book that we checked back then:

""Never before in American history has its president gone before so many foreign audiences to apologize for so many American misdeeds, both real and imagined,"" Romney wrote. ""It is his way of signaling to foreign countries and foreign leaders that their dislike for America is something he understands and that is, at least in part, understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe; President Obama's words are like kindling to them.""

In the book, Romney specifically named the speeches he was referring to:

""In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations and for feeding anti-Muslim sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy.""

At the time, we rated the claim False. 

Romney made a similar claim in June 2011 during a campaign appearance when he said, ""A few months into office, (President Barack Obama) traveled around the globe to apologize for America."" We rated that one Pants on Fire, because he implied the trips were intended to offer the president a forum to apologize to other countries. That was hardly the case. 

Let’s recap our specific findings.

What Obama said

For starters, as we looked over Obama's remarks, we noticed that he never used the word that is the universal hallmark of apologies: ""sorry."" Merriam-Webster defines an apology as ""an admission of error or discourtesy accompanied by an expression of regret.""

We read the seven Obama speeches cited in Romney’s book and selected the passages that seemed the most critical, apologetic or conciliatory, and then ran them by several experts with different points of view. Because of their length, we've compiled those passages into a separate document with links to the full remarks, and we encourage you to click over and read those remarks now.

At times, Obama uses an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand formulation that he tends to employ right before he asks the two sides to come together.

At a town hall meeting in France, for example, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and admitted that the United States ""has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive."" But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a ""casual"" and ""insidious"" anti-Americanism. ""On both sides of the Atlantic, these attitudes have become all too common. They are not wise. They do not represent the truth. They threaten to widen the divide across the Atlantic and leave us both more isolated,"" Obama concluded. And at a major address to the United Nations, Obama said, ""I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust. Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction.""

At other times, Obama doesn't seem so much to be criticizing the United States as he is criticizing the foreign policy stances of the Bush administration. In England, a reporter said that during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said that the power and authority of the United States had diminished in recent years. Obama was quick to turn the question toward the Bush team. ""Well, first of all, during the campaign I did not say that some of that loss of authority was inevitable,"" Obama said. ""I said it was traced to very specific decisions that the previous administration had made that I believed had lowered our standing in the world.... I would like to think that with my election and the early decisions that we've made, that you're starting to see some restoration of America's standing in the world.""

At a speech in Cairo on relations between the United States and the Islamic world, Obama got very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He did not make a formal expression of regret, but suggested both countries simply ""move forward."" Here are his exact remarks: ""In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward.""

Looking at all the remarks Romney cited, we noticed that Obama is most conciliatory when discussing torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama mentioned this in four separate instances that Romney cited in his book. Typically, Obama would say that the United States must always stay true to its ideals, and that's why Obama ""unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year."" (He has not been successful with his order of closing Guantanamo; we’ve rated it a Promise Broken.)

Obama's most pointed remarks on Guantanamo were at the National Archives, in a major speech on fighting terrorism. Obama said that after 9/11, ""our government made a series of hasty decisions. I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions."" He also said that the Guantanamo prison ""likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained. So the record is clear: Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened American national security. It is a rallying cry for our enemies.""

Did Obama apologize?

Back in 2010, we sent Obama's remarks to several different experts on foreign policy and apologies, to see if they thought Obama was apologizing.

• Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama is definitely apologizing, and it's not good. He co-wrote the Heritage analysis, ""Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower.""

""Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies,"" Gardiner said. ""It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advantage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership.""

He noted that Obama tends to be most apologetic about how the United States has fought terrorism and its approach to the Iraq war. ""There is a very strong partisan element to his apologies, but the biggest driving factor is Obama's personal belief that the U.S. is not an exceptional, uniquely great nation,"" he said.

• John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing.

""It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity,"" Murphy said. ""Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology. ... In rhetorical history, an apology is generally considered an account of some kind of bad behavior in which you are going to take responsibility and express regret.""

Romney's criticisms of Obama are part of a conservative tradition that emphasizes steadfastness in foreign policy, particularly in the wake of the Vietnam War. ""There's long been a strain of conservative rhetoric that argues that what matters most for the United States in the world is our will,"" Murphy said. ""The difficulty with that was shown in the second Bush administration, when will power is not quite enough. In Iraq, for example, you have to have a battle plan that makes sense and understand the situation you're going into'' and have enough resources to do that.

• Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it.

She said Obama's words fall short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words ""sorry"" or ""regret."" ""I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there,"" Bloom said.

Obama's remarks are really non-apologies, and they're not good in business or personal relationships, Bloom said. The one area where they can be useful: international diplomacy.

""Gov. Romney is trying to appeal to the inner John Wayne of his readers, and that has a certain emotional appeal,"" Bloom said. ""For the rest of us, a level assessment of less-than-perfect human behavior is perfectly reasonable.""

• Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who studies international human rights, maintains the Web site Political Apologies and Reparations, a database of documents on apologies. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery.

""To say the United States will not torture is not an apology, it is a statement of intent,"" Howard-Hassman said. ""A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it.""

Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said.

""Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society, and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect,"" she said. ""But a gesture of respect is not an apology.""

Other presidential apologies

Short of conducting a full review of all American presidents to see if any others had ever apologized, we decided to narrow our focus and look at Obama's two immediate predecessors, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.

Several sources we reviewed discussed Clinton's remarks about the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and described them as an apology. But Clinton did not explicitly apologize, and he assigned responsibility to the international community, not just the United States. ""The international community, together with nations in Africa, must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy as well,"" Clinton said in Rwanda in 1998. ""We did not act quickly enough after the killing began. We should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe haven for the killers. We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. We cannot change the past. But we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear, and full of hope.""

Clinton did apologize, forcefully, to the survivors and families of the experiments conducted in Tuskegee, Ala., in which government doctors left sick men untreated as part of a research study on syphilis. ""The United States government did something that was wrong -- deeply, profoundly, morally wrong,"" Clinton said at a formal ceremony in 1997. ""To the survivors, to the wives and family members, the children and the grandchildren, I say what you know: No power on Earth can give you back the lives lost, the pain suffered, the years of internal torment and anguish. What was done cannot be undone. But we can end the silence. We can stop turning our heads away. We can look at you in the eye and finally say on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry.""

Bush made remarks in 2002 about American slavery, which some people construed as an apology, at Goree Island, Senegal. But Bush did not formally apologize or express regret, instead opting to praise the Americans in history who worked to end slavery. ""My nation's journey toward justice has not been easy, and it is not over,"" he said. ""The racial bigotry fed by slavery did not end with slavery or with segregation. And many of the issues that still trouble America have roots in the bitter experience of other times. But however long the journey, our destination is set: liberty and justice for all.""

Bush did, however, specifically apologize to King Abdullah of Jordan for the abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The 2004 apology took place privately, but Bush and Abdullah spoke soon after at a Rose Garden press conference. ""We also talked about what has been on the TV screens recently, not only in our own country, but overseas -- the images of cruelty and humiliation. I told His Majesty as plainly as I could that the wrongdoers will be brought to justice, and that the actions of those folks in Iraq do not represent the values of the United States of America,"" Bush said. ""I told him I was sorry for the humiliation suffered by the Iraqi prisoners, and the humiliation suffered by their families. I told him I was equally sorry that people who have been seeing those pictures didn't understand the true nature and heart of America.""

Obama's praise and motivations

While Obama has admitted mistakes, he has also praised America. Romney acknowledged as much when he wrote that Obama, ""always the skillful politician, will throw in compliments about America here and there.""

In Cairo, Obama called the United States ""one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known. ... We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words -- within our borders, and around the world."" At the Langley speech, Obama told the CIA staff, ""What makes the United States special, and what makes you special, is precisely the fact that we are willing to uphold our values and our ideals even when it's hard, not just when it's easy; even when we are afraid and under threat, not just when it's expedient to do so. That's what makes us different. So, yes, you've got a harder job. And so do I. And that's okay, because that's why we can take such extraordinary pride in being Americans. And over the long term, that is why I believe we will defeat our enemies, because we're on the better side of history.""

And at his speech accepting the Nobel Prize, Obama said: ""Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms. The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans. We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will. We have done so out of enlightened self-interest -- because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if others' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity.""

What’s new from the debate

What Romney said at the debate in Orlando -- ""He went around the world and apologized for America"" -- is very similar to what he said at his campaign stop in June -- ""A few months into office, he traveled around the globe to apologize for America."" 

At the debate, Romney added this comment: ""He addressed the United Nations in his inaugural address and chastised our friend, Israel, for building settlements and said nothing about Hamas launching thousands of rockets into Israel."" 

We looked again at Obama's first speech at the United Nations. It's true that he does not specifically mention Hamas. But it's certainly not a one-sided chastisement of Israel. Obama repeatedly calls on Palestinians to understand and respect Israel's security needs. And he specifically mentions the fear Israeli civilians have of rocket attacks.

""We must remember that the greatest price of this conflict is not paid by us. It's not paid by politicians,"" Obama said. ""It's paid by the Israeli girl in Sderot who closes her eyes in fear that a rocket will take her life in the middle of the night. It's paid for by the Palestinian boy in Gaza who has no clean water and no country to call his own.""

Our ruling

Some of the Obama speeches that Romney cited in his book certainly laid out Obama’s foreign policy ideas, and it seems fair to say that a less confrontational approach was among Obama’s goals. Obama had made no secret during the campaign that he intended to set a different course on foreign policy than Bush -- a committed unilateralist -- had pursued.

Still, we think it’s incorrect for Romney to portray these early speeches as part of a global apology tour. Using Romney’s standard, you could argue that any change in foreign policy that’s undertaken after a presidential transition and announced to the world would constitute an ""apology"" for the previous policy.

On the substance of Romney’s charge, we believe that what we wrote in March 2010 still stands. While Obama's speeches contained some criticisms of past U.S. actions, those passages were typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and he frequently mentioned how other countries have erred as well. We found not a single, full-throated apology in the bunch. And on the new angle Romney has added -- that the trips were intended to offer the president a forum to apologize to other countries -- we think it’s a ridiculous charge. There’s a clear difference between changing policies and apologizing, and Obama didn’t do the latter. So we rate Romney’s statement Pants on Fire",/factchecks/2011/sep/23/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-repeats-claim-obama-went-around-world-/

Gary Johnson says U.S. prisons are packed with small-time drug dealers
","Presidential candidate Gary Johnson, a longtime advocate of legalizing marijuana, says U.S. prisons are packed with too many small-time drug dealers.

In a meeting with the editorial board of The Telegraph in Nashua, N.H., the former New Mexico governor explained some of the reasoning for his controversial position:

""We now have 2.3 million people behind bars in this country, we have the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world,"" Johnson said. ""The majority of those people behind bars are there because they sold small amounts of drugs.""

We'll examine his claim in two parts: Is the U.S. really a global leader in incarcerating citizens? And are small amounts of drugs such as marijuana really to blame?

Johnson’s New Hampshire Communications Director Matt Simon pointed us to some sources behind Johnson’s claim, citing data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and World Prison Brief, a publication of the International Centre for Prison Studies at the King's College School of Law in London.

We checked the Bureau of Justice Statistics figures and confirmed there were 2.3 million prisoners in local jails and state and federal prisons at the end of 2009.

The World Prison Brief lists prison population rates per 100,000 residents of each country.

The U.S. tops the list with 743 prisoners per 100,000 residents, followed by Rwanda with 595, the Russian Federation with 559, Georgia with 547 and the Virgin Islands (USA) with 539.

So Johnson is right with the first part of his claim about the total and the top ranking.

But do small-time drug dealers make up the majority of U.S. prisoners?

It depends whether you consider local, state or federal inmates, according to Tracy Snell, a statistician with the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics only investigates information regarding offense types every 5-7 years through inmate surveys, Snell said. So we had to go back to 2002 and 2004 for the most recent data that included the three levels of incarceration to determine what percentage of inmates were held for selling drugs.

The data reveal:

* Local level: 12.1 percent, which is far short of a majority.
* State level: 14.6 percent, also far short of a majority.
* Federal level: 50 percent.

Because the overwhelming majority of all prisoners are held at the state and local level, the number imprisoned for drug offenses is significantly short of a majority. Also, those numbers include all drug sales under the category drug trafficking. The percentages would likely be even smaller if they were limited to sales of small amounts of drugs the way Johnson suggested.

In our correspondence with Johnson’s campaign, Communications Director Simon admitted the error.

""After communicating with a few experts, I can now confirm that the third claim is inaccurate,"" Simon said. ""I believe the real number of those incarcerated for all drug-related crimes is closer to 25 percent of the overall population of incarcerated persons.

""Johnson may have been thinking specifically of the federal inmate population when he made the statement, and although there's difficulty in defining ‘small amounts,’ the statement is closer to being true if applied to inmates in federal prisons.""

Gov. Johnson also admitted his need to clarify, Simon said.

""I just spoke with Gov. Johnson about his error and he said, ’I stand corrected, thanks!’ so I'm sure he won't repeat this claim,"" Simon said.

So Johnson was correct to say that the U.S. has highest incarceration rate in the world, with an estimated total of 2.3 million inmates,but he was wrong that the majority of those imprisoned are being held for selling small amounts of drugs.

"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says Wisconsin is broke and $3 billion in debt
","
During the summer of 2011, the Republican-controlled state Legislature gave swift approval to the $66 billion 2011-’13 state budget, which was signed into law by Gov. Scott Walker.

That budget closed a $3.6 billion shortfall from the previous fiscal year, and also, for the first time in many years, closed the state’s structural deficit. In fact, as we noted in an earlier item, Walker’s budget is projected to leave a structural surplus at the end of the two years.

That’s why we were puzzled by a two-page fund-raising appeal that his campaign mailed to supporters Sept. 2, 2011.

""Wisconsin state government is $3 billion in debt, spending is too high, our business climate isn’t what it should be and Badger State voters gave me a mandate to turn our great state around,"" Walker said in the two-page letter.

""A fiscal tornado is barreling down on us at top speed. And we simply cannot continue spending, taxing, borrowing the way we have been,"" Walker added, declaring: ""Wisconsin is broke! This is our moment of reckoning. By dealing with our problems head-on and solving them, we’ll win a victory for Wisconsin’s future.""

Wait a minute.

That does sound like something straight out of the campaign office -- but from the 2010 campaign.

We called Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie to ask about the statement. He said he knew nothing about the letter, and sent us to state Republican Party spokeswoman Katie McCallum. She said she would look into the letter and get back to us. She didn’t.

Let’s start with the ""we’re broke"" statement.

That was a refrain used by Walker (and other Republicans locally and nationally) on the campaign trail and in early 2011, when Walker introduced a budget repair bill that called for curtailing collective bargaining for most public employees.

In the midst of that debate, PolitiFact Wisconsin rated the ""we’re broke"" statement False, noting that numerous experts said the state wasn’t teetering on the brink of bankruptcy or insolvency, and had numerous tools available to deal with any shortfall -- even if some of the options, such as tax increases, were declared off limits by the GOP.

We heard from many readers who disagreed with that assessment.

But repeating the statement now flies in the face of the many positive statements Walker made after the budget passed.

Significantly, the state budget by law must be balanced, so the $3.6 billion shortfall had to be resolved. And the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau -- accepted by both sides as the neutral scorekeeper on such matters -- says the structural deficit is gone for the first time since it started using the calculation to measure the long-term impact of future obligations the state faces.

Here’s what Walker said when he signed the budget June 27, 2011: ""Through honest budgeting, we are providing an alternative to the reckless tricks and gimmicks of the past.""

We asked Werwie whether Walker has recently used the ""broke"" phrase.

""He hasn’t said that in eons,"" Werwie said.

Beyond that, the state never was $3 billion in debt -- we rated a statement on that topic by GOP state Senate candidate Jonathan Steitz as False. Why? The state faced a $3.6 billion budget shortfall -- the difference between tax revenue projections and what agencies plan to spend in the next budget. But that’s separate from any long-term debt obligations.

The contradictory statements in the letter also extend to comments about the state’s business climate, which Walker said ""isn’t what it should be.""

The letter does not specify by what measure, but this also flies counter to what Walker has been stating publicly.

He routinely notes Wisconsin’s standing improved from 41st to 24th on the list of business-friendly states compiled by Chief Executive magazine. A Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce survey found ""88 percent of Wisconsin business leaders said they are confident the state is heading in the right direction, up from just 10 percent a year ago.""

And Walker and GOP lawmakers note that their first actions this year came in a special session of the Legislature dedicated to steps aimed to improved the state’s business climate.

Here’s what WMC president Kurt Bauer said July 11, 2011 in a column on the group’s website.

""Governor Scott Walker set the right tone even before he took office by announcing the state was ‘open for business.’ Walker backed up his slogan by introducing a two-year budget plan that solved the $3.6 billion deficit without raising taxes. ""

Said Werwie: ""Certainly our business climate has gotten substantially better.""

Our conclusion

In a fund-raising letter full of urgency, Walker criticizes unions and Democrats in the Legislature while proclaiming the state is broke and $3 billion in debt. But the statement flies in the face of a balanced budget with a structural surplus and the upbeat rhetoric coming out of the governor’s office.

Understandable, perhaps. After all, the letter is geared toward getting supporters to contribute money to the campaign in the face of a possible recall attempt in 2012. But in doing so, Walker contradicts his own statements -- and reality.

The statements are false and ridiculous. Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/sep/22/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-wisconsin-broke-and-3-billio/
"['Social Security', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says that Mitt Romney wrote that if Social Security were done in the private sector, it'd be called criminal
","
Defending his published characterization of Social Security as a failure of legally questionable origin, Texas Gov. Rick Perry turned the tables on Mitt Romney, saying: ""You said if people did it in the private sector it would be called criminal. That's in your book.""

Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, shot back in the Sept. 12, 2011, Republican presidential debate: ""Gov. Perry, you've got to quote me correctly. You said it's criminal. What I said was Congress taking money out of the Social Security trust fund is like (a) criminal (act) and that is and it's wrong.""

We wondered if Perry accurately recapped Romney’s description of Social Security.

Let’s start from a fuller excerpt of their debate exchange.

At the debate, Romney challenged Perry’s repeated description of Social Security as a Ponzi scheme. Romney, addressing Perry, said the Ponzi term is ""what scared seniors, number one. And number two, suggesting that Social Security should no longer be a federal program and returned to the states and unconstitutional is likewise frightening.

""Look, there are a lot of bright people who agree with you,"" Romney continued. ""And that's your view. I happen to have a different one. I think that Social Security is an essential program that we should change the way we're funding it. You called it a criminal--""

Perry jumped in: ""You said if people did it in the private sector it would be called criminal. That's in your book.""

We’ve run several looks at Perry’s Social Security descriptions in his 2010 book, Fed Up!, rating False his claim that the government program is a Ponzi scheme. Unlike such a criminal enterprise, Social Security is obligated to pay benefits and participants are aware of how the system operates; it’s public. Unlike a Ponzi scheme, too, Social Security is accountable to Congress and the American people.

More recently, PolitiFact in Washington rated True Romney’s charge in the Sept. 12 debate that Perry called Social Security a ""failure"" in his book and rated Mostly True Romney’s claim that Perry also called Social Security unconstitutional. Perry’s book lacks such an explicit statement, but Perry argues that the Supreme Court should not have ruled significant pieces of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal constitutional and by doing so, ""we’ve been forced to accept (Social Security) for more than 70 years now.""

And did Perry accurately recap Romney’s own Social Security moan?
In chapter two of his 2010 book, No Apology: The Case for American Greatness, Romney says reporters did not press the 2008 presidential candidates on how they would shore up or reform Social Security, which could be forced to trim benefits starting in the late 2030s if changes aren’t adopted.

In chapter six, Romney says Social Security has grown exponentially since its inception in the mid-1930s. He adds that the program’s ""trust fund"" is a fiction. How so? Payroll taxes fund Social Security. Last year, for the first time since 1983, payouts exceeded receipts. So before last year, Social Security ran an annual surplus that was placed into a trust fund that earns interest. But Congress has routinely borrowed Social Security’s surplus to cover other government spending and left behind IOUs from the U.S. Treasury to cover future costs. ""There is no fund"" in the conventional sense, Romney writes.

Romney’s reference to criminality comes next, in an analogy.

""To put it in a nutshell, the American people have been effectively defrauded out of their Social Security,"" Romney writes, adding later: ""Let’s look at what would happen if someone in the private sector did a similar thing. Suppose two grandparents created a trust fund, appointed a bank as trustee, and instructed the bank to invest the proceeds of the trust fund so as to provide for their grandchildren’s education. Suppose further that the bank used the proceeds for its own purposes, so that when the grandchildren turned 18, there was no money for them to go to college. What would happen to the bankers responsible for misusing the money? They would go to jail. But what has happened to the people responsible for the looming bankruptcy of Social Security? They keep returning to Congress every two years.""

For this article, we’re not judging the accuracy or adequacy of this analogy. Instead, to refresh, we’re drilling in on whether Perry accurately aired Romney’s characterization of Social Security.

True, Romney mentions the private sector, as Perry claims.

In the book, Romney then shifts into his analogy about a bank spending money from a trust fund that was set up to cover a future expense -- a grandchild’s college education. The bankers in charge of the trust fund in Romney’s example would face prosecution for, in effect, stealing the trust fund’s money. Romney says their behavior would be called criminal, again as Perry says.

However, as Romney said in the debate, this reference to criminal behavior focuses on the trust fund’s ""surplus"" not being socked away and kept safe until needed, a diversion he blames on Congress. By our read, it’s not reasonable to interpret the analogy as saying that if the entire Social Security program were in the private sector, it would be called criminal. Perry’s claim echoes some of Romney's language, but ultimately overreaches.",/factchecks/2011/sep/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-mitt-romney-wrote-if-social-securi/

State Sen. Raymond Lesniak says New Jersey’s horse racing industry employs 13,000 people and preserves 176,000 acres of farmland
","
The glory days of horse racing in New Jersey have faded.

But if the industry disappears completely, state Sen. Raymond Lesniak claims it will put 13,000 jobs and 176,000 acres of horse farmland at risk.

Lesniak harnessed those statistics in an opinion item promoting two initiatives he says will generate new revenue for horse racing: sports betting and Internet gambling. Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a bill in March that would have allowed Internet gambling and declined to join a lawsuit aimed at overturning the ban on sports betting in the state.

""There is a path to recovery for New Jersey’s $1 billion horse racing industry — which employs 13,000 individuals and ensures the preservation of 176,000 acres of horse farmland — if Gov. Chris Christie would just get off his high horse and see the irreparable damage his tough love is reaping on the industry,"" Lesniak (D-Union) wrote in a Sept. 9 letter to the editor in the Asbury Park Press. ""Unfortunately, horse racing is not at a crossroad; it’s at a tipping point, from which it will not recover when it falls.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found Lesniak incorrectly applied statistics representing the overall equine industry to illustrate the impact of horse racing.

The statistics are from a 2007 study by the Rutgers Equine Science Center that measured the economic impact of the state’s equine industry. All equine animals, including horses, donkeys and mules, were included in the study. But horses account for the bulk of New Jersey’s equine population.

The report found that the equine industry has an annual economic impact of $1.1 billion and generates 13,000 jobs. Equine operations -- farms and stables that house equine animals -- in the state span 176,000 acres of farmland, according to the study.

Of the $1.1 billion in economic impact, $780 million is generated by racetracks and racing-related operations.

""So there’s no doubt that horse racing is the economic driving engine of the entire horse industry in New Jersey,"" said Karyn Malinowski, director of the Rutgers Equine Science Center.

The horse racing industry is responsible for 7,000 of the 13,000 jobs in the overall equine industry and 34,000 of the 176,000 acres of farmland that comprise equine operations in the state, the study said.

When we told Lesniak’s office about the problem with his statistics, he said, in a written statement, ""My comment was for the entire horse industry because without horse racing it will ultimately die, as we’ve seen with the announced closing of the largest horse farm, Perretti.""

Perretti Farms of Cream Ridge specializes in the  breeding and racing of standardbred horses, according to its website. This summer the farm announced plans to close in the next two years.

So, Lesniak’s numbers are off, but let’s look at his larger point. Is the horse racing industry the lifeline of New Jersey’s equine industry?

Malinowski said the entire equine industry is in danger if the horse racing industry crumbles.

""All of these top-shelf support services that you have available to you in the Garden State will be gone,"" she said. ""Because they are primarily supported by racing.""

 Jim Heird, executive professor and coordinator at Texas A&M University’s Equine Initiative, said, in general, ""If we lose one part of the industry, it affects the welfare of the entire industry.""

""I think that when any industry leaves the state, it will have some sort of an impact on the economy of the state,"" Lynne Richmond, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Agriculture said. ""We recognize a loss of horse racing in New Jersey would have an impact.""

Our ruling

Horse racing generates $780 million in annual economic impact in New Jersey. It's responsible for 7,000 jobs and equine operations tied to horse racing account for 34,000 acres of farmland in the state, according to a 2007 study.

Lesniak exaggerated the impact of horse racing by incorrectly applying figures for the overall equine industry in New Jersey to one segment of that industry.

But the numbers for horse racing alone -- particularly the annual economic impact figure -- are a significant portion of the statistics for the industry at large and there’s consensus about a broad impact if horse racing disappears from New Jersey.

We rate his statement Half True.

"['Rhode Island', 'Education', 'Sheldon Whitehouse']","
Sen. Whitehouse says full Pell Grants cover only 34 percent of public college costs, down from 72 percent in 1976
","
On July 28, 2011, The Hill newspaper ran a story saying, ""House conservatives who have stalled legislation to raise the national debt limit are angry that it includes $17 billion in supplemental spending for Pell Grants, which some compare to welfare.""

Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse cited that article when he rose to speak on the Senate floor the following day. He criticized House Republicans for an earlier failed attempt to cut Pell Grant funding, and he defended the debt deal’s increase in Pell Grant funding, noting the program’s Rhode Island roots.

""When Rhode Island’s great Senator Claiborne Pell first proposed the grants that now bear his name, he envisioned a grant that would enable low-income students to attend our country’s wonderful colleges and universities so they, too, could share in the American dream,"" Whitehouse said.

""In 1976, the first year that Pell Grants were fully funded, a full Pell Grant paid 72 percent of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college. Today, a full Pell Grant covers just 34 percent of those costs. Still, this vital assistance can often mean the difference between being able to attend college or not. With many families in Rhode Island and the country still struggling in this economy, we should be looking for ways to strengthen Pell Grants, not weaken them.""

Whether Pell grants should be cut or increased is for others to decide. But we wondered whether their buying power has really plunged as far as Whitehouse claimed.

We asked Whitehouse’s office to provide the basis for his assertion.

The senator’s spokesman provided a document, dated July 12, from the Federal Education Budget Project of the New America Foundation, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C.

""In fiscal year 1976, the first year that the Pell Grant program was fully funded at its authorized level, the maximum Pell Grant was $1,400 and covered 72 percent of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college,"" the document said.

""Despite regular increases in funding and grant levels, the purchasing power of the Pell Grant has decreased over the past 30 years as the price of college has risen. In the 2009-10 school year, the maximum Pell Grant covered 36 percent of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college.""

To check the think tank’s numbers, we turned to the U.S. Department of Education, which administers the Pell Grant program. It said the maximum grant was $5,350 in 2009-10 -- up from $1,400 in 1976-77. The department’s National Center for Education Statistics said the average cost of attending a four-year public institution was $15,014 in 2009-10 -- up from $1,935 in 1976-77.

Do the math and you find the maximum Pell Grant covered 36 percent of the average cost of attending a four-year public institution in 2009-10 --- down from 72 percent in 1976-77.

That’s exactly what the New America Foundation document said, but it’s not exactly what Whitehouse said on the Senate floor: that Pell grants ""now"" cover 34 percent of those costs.

So why the slight discrepancy? Whitehouse’s spokesman said the senator was referring to more recent figures, for the 2010-11 academic year. He cited a report from the Advocacy & Policy Center of College Board, a nonprofit membership organization that sells standardized tests and does education research.

That report notes that the maximum Pell Grant has risen to $5,550 for the 2010-11 academic year. ""This amount covers 34 percent of the average published tuition, fees, room, and board at a public four-year college,"" the report says, using an average cost of $16,140 for attending a four-year public institution in 2010-11.

Whitehouse appears to have done his homework. We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/22/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-whitehouse-says-full-pell-grants-cover-only-34/
"['Ohio', 'Trade', 'Rob Portman']","
Sen. Rob Portman says trade agreement with S. Korea helped EU exports jump at U.S. expense
","
As former U.S. Trade Representative during the presidency of George W. Bush, Sen. Rob Portman has become a Republican point man on trade in the U.S. Senate.

The day before President Barack Obama announced a $447 billion proposal to boost the economy and create jobs,  Portman joined a group of GOP Senators Sept. 7, 2011, at a Capitol Hill news conference to suggest that Obama could create jobs quickly by sending pending trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama to Congress, where all three would likely pass with bipartisan support.

Portman argued countries which have adopted trade pacts are gaining market share in those three nations that would go to U.S. farmers and companies but for the stalled trade agreements. Noting that the European Union passed a trade agreement with Korea in July, he backed up his point by citing Korean customs service statistics that he deemed ""startling.""

""In the month of July alone, EU exports to South Korea increased by over 36 percent,"" Portman said. ""A lot of that is our market share. Those are our farmers and our service providers who are suffering. By the way, during that same period, U.S. exports to Korea increased only 2.9 percent.""

Observing that it’s now easier for Korea to import vehicles from Europe rather than the U.S.,  Portman declared: ""We need to move and move quickly here before we lose even more market share.""

Did EU exports really jump that much while U.S. numbers dropped? And was it at the expense of U.S. farmers and our service providers? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check into Portman’s claim.

We contacted his office to ask where he got his statistics. They passed along an August 25 statement from South Korea’s embassy.

""Merely one month after the Korea-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA) went into effect on July 1, 2011, EU exports to Korea rose 36.7 percent compared to the same month last year,"" the statement said. ""Meanwhile U.S. exports to Korea increased by just 2.9 percent over the same period, according to Korea Customs Service. In July 2010, U.S. exports were greater in value than EU exports to Korea. One year later, however, the opposite is true, as the U.S.Korea FTA (KORUS FTA) remains unratified.""

It went onto urge passage of the trade agreement, claiming that ""continued KORUS FTA delay is placing U.S. farmers, manufacturers, service providers and workers at a significant disadvantage in the Korean market, jeopardizing potentially billions of dollars in sales opportunities and tens of thousands of American jobs.""

That statement certainly backs up the numbers that Portman used. But the situation grew murkier after we examined trade data for other months to see whether the trade agreement’s passage actually escalated EU trade with Korea, as the news release claimed.

Embassy spokesman John Brinkley supplied trade figures from Korea’s ""Ministry of Knowledge Economy,"" which is similar to the U.S. Commerce Department. He said that Korea’s Customs Service releases its data in the Korean language - which PolitiFact doesn’t understand - while the Ministry of Knowledge Economy releases English language data.

Brinkley said the agencies use slightly different methodologies to compute their statistics, so their numbers are a bit off from each other, but often show similar trends. For instance, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy data sheet for July shows a 44.9 percent growth rate in goods that South Korea obtained from the EU, (instead of the customs service’s 36.7 percent)  and an 8.5 percent uptick in goods from the U.S (instead of the other agency’s 2.9 percent). It also showed that Korea got 8.4 percent of its imports from the United States that month, and 10.3 percent of its imports from the European Union.

If the July trade agreement had rapidly escalated the EU’s share of exports to Korea, one would expect that trend to continue in August. It did not.

August statistics released Sept. 5 from the Ministry of Knowledge Economy show U.S. exports were 22 percent greater than last August, outstripping the EU’s 14.8 percent growth rate. That month, 9.2 percent of South Korea’s imports came from the United States, 8.8 percent came from the European Union.

What’s more, Ministry of Knowledge Economy statistics for the first half of the year, showed South Korea got 8.9 percent of its imports from the EU in the six months before the trade agreement kicked in, and 8.6 percent of its imports from the United States. The EU’s year-over-year growth rate in those months was 25.5 percent, compared with 11.5 percent for the United States.

Brinkley said it would be impossible to prove the July surge in exports from the EU resulted from the trade agreement, although plenty of anecdotal evidence to that effect was reported in the Korean press, such as EU companies saying they’d  lower their wholesale prices in Korea, and Korean retailers saying they would lower prices on EU goods after the trade agreement was approved.

""Why the US/EU ratio was less pronounced in August is anybody's guess,"" Brinkley said in an email.

Brinkley supplied Korean Customs Service data that also showed U.S. exports to South Korea outstripping that month’s EU exports. He indicated U.S. exports to South Korea for August rose 33.8 percent ""year-on-year,"" while EU exports rose 17.1 percent. Still, he said the ""average July-August 2011 export growth"" was 17.8 percent for the U.S, and 26.5 percent for the EU.

He attributed August’s uptick in U.S. exports to Boeing’s delivery of three F-15 fighter planes to South Korea, as well as increased U.S. grain exports occasioned by South Korea’s unusually severe August monsoon season. Brinkley said both trade agreements are structured in such a way that grain tariffs are phased out over periods ranging from 5 to 10 years, ""so EU grain is not yet significantly cheaper than US grain.""

Todd Tucker, who is research director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, which opposes trade agreements, noted that Portman and other trade agreement advocates focus only on exports, and ignore imports that could cost U.S. jobs. He also said ""so-called FTAs""  do not necessarily increase exports.

""In both Thailand and Taiwan (also not FTA partners), the U.S. is selling more in dollar terms than it was in 2005,"" Tucker said in an email. ""In contrast, the U.S. has lost rank and market share in Australia since 2005, and the U.S. has had an FTA in place with Australia over that entire time period. In sum, there are a  lot of ways to boost exports, but history shows that FTAs are not one of them.""

So where does that leave Portman’s statement?

The senator accurately quoted the trade stats he obtained from the Korean embassy’s August 25 news release.

But the data doesn’t support the other part of his claim -- his underlying point that countries which have adopted trade pacts are gaining market share that would go to U.S. farmers and companies.

It is contradicted by the data for August trade available from Korea’s Ministry of Knowledge Economy released two days before Portman spoke. And statistics for the six months before the EU trade agreement kicked in show EU trade growth.

On the Truth-O-Meter,  we rate Portman’s claim Half True.

Barbara Boxer says 400 richest taxpayers saw incomes grow by 400%, tax rates fall by 40%
","During a Sept. 20, 2011, interview with Al Sharpton on MSNBC, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., sought to highlight how America’s richest taxpayers have benefited economically in recent years.

""The top 400 earners in this country are worth more … than half of the American people,"" Boxer said. ""And since 1995, the top 400 wealthiest families have seen their incomes go up 400 percent and their tax rates go down 40 percent.""

We checked the first part -- that the top 400 tax payers saw their incomes grow by 400 percent -- in March 2010, giving it a rating of True. But the second half of her statement was new to us, so we decided to look into it.

When Boxer made her comments, the question of how much the wealthy should pay in taxes was at the top of the national agenda. In remarks on Sept. 19, 2011 about his plan for reducing the federal debt, President Barack Obama said that ""middle-class families shouldn’t pay higher taxes than millionaires and billionaires. That’s pretty straightforward. It’s hard to argue against that. Warren Buffett’s secretary shouldn’t pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett."" (Buffett is the legendary investor who for years has placed high on the list of richest Americans.)

As we explored elsewhere, Obama is correct that it’s possible for a secretary to pay a higher tax rate than a very wealthy person, but it’s also not typical. In general, wealthier taxpayers do in fact pay a higher percentage in taxes than less-affluent people. The main exceptions are people in Buffett’s category -- the richest of the rich, whose income comes mainly from capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at 15 percent rather than the maximum of 35 percent for wages and salaries, and hedge fund managers, who benefit from a tax code provision that also taxes their earnings at 15 percent.

In her comment, Boxer explicitly focused on Buffett’s peers.

Her data comes from a periodic Internal Revenue Service report that looks at the income and tax data from the 400 tax returns with the highest adjusted gross income. (In case you’re wondering, these 400 titans aren’t named, and their data is aggregated.) Technically, these aren’t ""families"" necessarily, but for a comment made during a television interview, we think it’s close enough.

We’ll take Boxer’s two claims in order. The data we’re using, which goes back to 1992, is adjusted for inflation.

""Since 1995, the top 400 wealthiest families have seen their incomes go up 400 percent.""

In 1995, the aggregate adjusted gross income for all 400 tax returns worked out to $17.4 billion, or an average of $43.6 million per return.

By 2008 -- the most recent year available -- the aggregate income for the top 400 soared to nearly $66 billion, or more than $164 million in adjusted gross income per return.

That amounts to a 276 percent increase. If Boxer had been using data one year older, she would have been correct: Using 2007 data, the rise was almost exactly 400 percent. This illustrates how sensitive this measurement is to economic conditions.

""Since 1995 the top 400 wealthiest families have seen … their tax rates go down 40 percent.""

From the same IRS document, we can see that the average tax rate for the top 400 returns was 29.93 percent in 1995 and 18.11 percent in 2008. That’s a decline of 39 percent -- for our purposes, close enough to Boxer’s claim to be accurate.

Our ruling

On the data, Boxer is right for one claim and wrong for the other, though on the one for which she’s incorrect, she would have been right using data from one year earlier.

More broadly, even the smaller, 276 percent increase supports her underlying point -- that for the richest of the rich, incomes have grown by leaps and bounds while average tax rates have declined for the same group by 40 percent.

As we’ve noted, extrapolating tax-burden patterns from the super-rich (like these 400 tax-paying units) to the merely very rich, the rich or the plain old affluent should be done with care. As the Congressional Budget Office has determined, the tax system is generally progressive, despite the lower tax rates for Buffett and his peers. The poorest one-fifth has an effective tax rate of 4.3 percent, the next fifth has a rate of 10.2 percent, the middle fifth has a rate of 14.2 percent, the second-highest has a rate of 17.6 percent, and the top fifth has a rate of 25.8 percent. And the rates keep going up the higher you climb. The top 10 percent of earners had an effective tax rate of 27.5 percent, the top 5 percent had a rate of 29 percent, and the top 1 percent had a rate of 31.2 percent.

In other words, the top 400 have a distinctly different tax pattern than even the richest 1 percent of American taxpayers, a much larger group that includes about 1.1 million households with an average pre-tax income of $1.7 million.

Still, Boxer chose her words carefully. She referred to the top 400 taxpayers, and by that standard, her numbers, while imperfect, largely stand up. We rate her statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/21/barbara-boxer/barbara-boxer-says-400-richest-taxpayers-saw-incom/
"['Georgia', 'Ethics', 'Nathan Deal']","
Ethics budget cuts on par with Deal’s office
","
Political observers were transfixed this summer by the soap opera playing in the offices of the Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission.

The body also known as the state ethics commission was rocked when commission executive secretary Stacey Kalberman, and her deputy, Sherilyn Streicker, announced in June their departures from the agency.

The reasons behind their exits were tied up with the drama over a politically charged investigation into the election campaign of Gov. Nathan Deal. Kalberman claimed orders to eliminate Streicker’s position and cut her own $125,000 salary by a third were politically motivated, while commission Chairman Patrick Millsaps and other commission members said cuts to the commission’s budget meant it could no longer afford the executives’ salaries.

The salary talks came as Kalberman was preparing to serve subpoenas on the governor, his chief of staff and associates for campaign spending documents as part of an ethics investigation. The subpoenas never were served, and the commission has asked Deal’s lawyer to voluntarily turn the papers over.

Some have said the General Assembly’s slashing of the commission budget has weakened its ability to investigate irregularities. But when Deal was asked about it in a Q&A in the current edition of Georgia Trend magazine, he said the commission was not cut more than any other part of state government, including his own office.

""They took absolutely the same percent of cuts as most other state agencies,"" he said. ""When you’re making up a $1.4 billion [deficit], we had to continue to cut. They were somewhere in the 7 percent range – same as the governor’s office.""

Deal is the right man to talk to about the state budget since the General Assembly largely followed his blueprint to craft the $18.3 billion spending plan for the new state fiscal year, which began July 1.

Did he get it right?

Long story short, the answer is yes. But it turns out that when dealing with the state budget, getting there isn’t half the fun.

From the start, Brian Robinson laid the groundwork by saying his boss was speaking off the cuff.

""What the governor knew was that he ordered the governor’s office to have as big a cut as any agency,"" he said. ""Obviously, not all agencies or departments got cuts. Education, for example, got more money than before.""

With help from the state Office of Planning and Budget, we find there is some math to wade through before we get our answer.

On July 1, the ethics commission started out with a budget of $1,084,145, compared with last year’s original allocation of $1,131,121. That’s actually a 4.2 percent cut.

By comparison, the governor’s office began fiscal 2011 with $6,276,732 and started this year with $5,914,065. That’s a 5.8 percent cut, which would indicate the governor was more than right in that the governor’s office took an even larger percentage cut to its budget than the ethics commission.

But inside every agency’s budget is what the budget office refers to as ""adjustments."" Adjustments are essentially pass-through funds given to pay for things such as health insurance and workers’ compensation and are not considered part of the agency’s operating budget.

Take those adjustments out, and using the baseline of the original fiscal 2011 appropriation, the cut to the ethics commission’s new budget is 7.6 percent. And, using the same calculation, the cut to the governor’s office is 7.2 percent.

Robinson said the budget numbers reflect a promise kept.

""Facing a budget deficit, Gov. Deal led the way he promised Georgians he would. He cut spending,"" Robinson said. ""He set the example by cutting the governor's office budget by 7 percent, as much as any state agency or department.""

The governor appoints three of the five board members to the ethics commission; the General Assembly appoints the other two.

It was up to the commissioners to figure out how to spend their smaller budget. The contemplated cut to Kalberman’s salary and the elimination of Streicker’s position accomplished that.

For sake of context, the ethics commission’s budget has been slashed 42 percent since fiscal 2008, but the new governor had no say in it until this year.

While this likely does little to settle questions over the staffing changes at the ethics commission, it does verify Deal’s statement to Georgia Trend, which we rate True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/21/nathan-deal/ethics-budget-cuts-par-deals-office/

Rick Perry says he never was for 2008 Wall Street rescue package
","
Stumping for president in Newton, Iowa, Texas Gov. Rick Perry denied that he ever supported the 2008 legislation approved by Congress to rescue Wall Street.

A recording of Perry’s Sept. 16, 2011, comments was placed online by Steve Deace, a radio host, who says on the recording that ""our very own"" Rebekah Maxwell asked Perry about his ""past endorsement"" of the ""controversial (Troubled Asset Relief Program) bailout ... which a lot of people believe launched the Tea Party movement in America.""

Our transcript of the Maxwell-Perry exchange:

Maxell: ""One thing that I was wondering about was your earlier support for TARP and how that ... makes a difference?""

Perry: ""You got wrong information.""

Maxwell: ""You never supported TARP?""

Perry: ""No, ma’am.""

Maxwell: ""No. I thought I saw a letter where you had actually written encouraging the support of TARP legislation.""

Perry: ""No, ma’am, you saw wrong."" 
Did Perry never support the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which established TARP and allowed the bail out of Wall Street?

Fortuitously, this covers turf we plowed in January 2010 in rating Half True a claim by U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison that Perry was for the Wall Street bailout before he was against it.

Hutchison said in a Texas gubernatorial debate that Perry signed a letter sent to members of Congress on the day the Senate was scheduled to vote on the bailout bill, urging lawmakers to ""pass an economic recovery package.""
   
""You wrote a letter to Congress saying pass this bill, we need to shore up the financial markets,"" Hutchison said. ""…Governor, you asked for it too. You were for it before you were against it.""
   
In the debate, Perry conceded that he co-wrote a letter with West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin. But, he said, he and Manchin ""thought you were smart enough to understand what we were talking about--stop the spending and cut the taxes.""
   
""Governor,"" Hutchison replied, ""that’s not what the letter said.""
   
""I wish we’d made it a little clearer for you,"" Perry said.
   
Perry probably could have made it clearer for everybody.
   
This much is certain: On the morning of Oct. 1, 2008, the Republican Governors Association and Democratic Governors Association publicized a three-paragraph letter signed by their respective chairmen, Perry and Manchin, stating: ""We strongly urge Congress to leave partisanship at the door and pass an economic recovery package ... If Congress does not act soon, the situation will grow appreciably worse.""
   
The letter doesn’t explicitly endorse the plan then before the Senate. But no other plan was in play that day amid national fears of an economic collapse. And The Associated Press cast the governors' letter as part of a frantic national push for the $700 billion bailout of Wall Street sought by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and President George W. Bush.
   
Later the same day, Perry issued a contradictory-sounding second statement, partly headlined: ""On Protecting Taxpayers.""
   
""In a free market economy,"" Perry said, ""government should not be in the business of using taxpayer dollars to bail out corporate America.""
   
Asked to clarify at the time what Perry wanted the Senate to do, his spokeswoman, Allison Castle, demurred. ""The senators have to make their own decisions,"" Castle said.
       
Asked in 2009 about Perry's dual messages, Perry spokesman Mark Miner saw nothing confusing. Miner said Perry simply favored tax and spending cuts over bailouts.
   
""You call on Congress to take action, nine times out of 10, the action they take is wrong,"" Miner said.
   
After the Republican gubernatorial debate, we sought out Manchin for his take on the letter. In a comment delivered by a spokesman, Manchin said: ""You had to look at the situation our country was facing then. What we were urging was for Congress to work together in a bipartisan effort, and to follow the lead of the governors ... to move the states ahead. That effort continues today.""
   
At the time of the Senate action in 2008, Manchin said he supported his state's two Democratic senators, Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, who voted for the Wall Street package. But he too sounded a contradictory note: ""I do not support a bailout. Nobody supports bailing somebody out on the backs of working people … for someone to profit on Wall Street.""
   
All in all, it's easy to see the rationale for charging Perry with being for the legislation. The Manchin-Perry letter urged action on the very day the Senate was poised to take up the bailout package.
   
Still, Perry is correct that the joint letter didn’t explicitly advocate the Senate plan. Also, his second Oct. 1, 2008, statement could be taken as a timely signal he didn’t want Congress to rescue Wall Street the way it did.

State Sen. Michael Skindell says oil, gas companies in Ohio have spent $1 billion plus on drilling leases
","
Ohio Gov. John Kasich has enthusiastically cheered the money-making prospects of hydraulic fracking, a technique used to extract oil and gas from underground shale.

Eastern Ohio, with its energy-laden Utica and Marcellus shale formations, is high on the list of targeted areas where companies are looking buy up rights to drill for the lucrative resources below.

But many have voiced environmental concerns over the process, which pumps millions of gallons of chemical-laced water and sand deep into horizontal wells under high pressure.
  
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is studying hydraulic fracking’s effects on drinking water. And New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican whose pugnacious and conservative style is often compared with Kasich’s, last month ordered a one-year moratorium on the practice so more information can be gathered. Enter Ohio State Sen. Michael Skindell. 
Skindell, a Lakewood Democrat, this month introduced Senate Bill 213, which would institute a ban on hydraulic fracking until the EPA completes its study and lawmakers have time to digest it. A companion bill would require companies to disclose chemicals it uses when drilling. 
Both pieces legislation are aimed at what Skindell sees as a fracking bonanza. 
""In the recent year, we have seen the oil and gas companies go to homeowners throughout Ohio and encourage them to sign leases and turn over mineral rights for this process,"" Skindell said during a Statehouse news conference to promote the two bills. ""And I understand that over a billion dollars worth of leases have been signed to date."" 
That billion-dollar figure caught PolitiFact Ohio’s attention, given the relatively fledgling fracking market. True, reports across Ohio have pegged the Utica shale formations in eastern Ohio as a new frontier of sorts. But $1 billion? We went to Skindell to learn his source. 
Skindell shared with us a web link to a March story published by the Dayton Daily News. The newspaper focused on one company, Chesapeake Energy Corp. of Oklahoma City. Chesapeake, the article noted, ""has reportedly spent $1 billion acquiring leases in Ohio without drilling a producing well, a figure reported by the Wall Street Journal on March 7."" 
By the time it left Skindell’s lips, it was a fact repeated at least third-hand. If it was a fact all. So off to the Wall Street Journal we went. The March 7 story attributed the $1 billion figure to Chesapeake. Journal reporter Ryan Dezember referred PolitiFact Ohio to earnings statements and other financial documents from the publicly held company. Mindful that the news at this point was 6 months old, Dezember theorized that the figure had likely grown. 
Sure enough, a transcript of a July 29 conference call between Chesapeake executives, investors and analysts and Chairman and Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon confirmed this. 
""... We’ve spent between $1.5 billion and $2 billion acquiring leasehold in the Utica,"" said McClendon, referring to the shale in eastern Ohio. And of course, Chesapeake wouldn’t have invested that amount if executives weren’t convinced the resources could yield much more. 
In a financial report issued the day before the conference call, Chesapeake noted that officials believed the Utica shale play could add between $15 billion and $20 billion in value. 
Chesapeake is not the only party interested in Ohio shale. Clif Little, an Ohio State University extension educator in Guernsey and Noble counties, said more than 1,200 property owners have taken his ""leasing farmland for oil and gas"" classes this year. Drilling companies, small oil and gas companies, landowner associations and attorneys all are attempting to secure deep drilling rights, Little added. 
""The $1 billion figure is an old figure,"" Little wrote in an email. ""The amount invested in the Utica and Marcellus would far exceed that number today, but I am no longer keeping track of investment figures."" 
Although he might not have been right on the money, Skindell was very much in the ballpark with respect to Chesapeake’s figures. If anything, he undersold the political point he was trying to make: that Ohio is on the cusp of a fracking boom. 
Skindell’s words were ""over a billion dollars worth of leases,"" and clearly that is the case. 
As a result, we rate Skindell’s statement True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/20/michael-skindell/state-sen-michael-skindell-says-oil-gas-companies-/

Nancy Pelosi says jobs increased faster in 2010 than in eight years under Bush
","
During a Sept. 17, 2011, edition of the MSNBC show Up with Chris Hayes, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., offered a defense of the U.S. economy’s job creation record during President Barack Obama’s tenure.

""When President (George W.) Bush was president for those eight years with those tax policies, we lost jobs,"" Pelosi said. ""In fact, more jobs were created in the second year -- that would be last year -- in the private-sector in the Obama administration than in the eight years of the Bush administration. And they want us to repeat those tax cuts at the high end which, again, did not create jobs, but they did deepen the deficit.""

It’s a variation of a talking point we have checked twice in the past year. Before we rule on Pelosi’s current iteration, we’ll review how we rated the previous two instances.

What Pelosi has said previously

The first time came in October 2010, during an interview on MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann. Pelosi said, ""More private-sector jobs were created in the first eight months of 2010 than in the eight years of the Bush administration."" We found that data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed 111,634,000 Americans employed in the private-sector at the start of George W. Bush's first term, in January 2001. Eight years later, in January 2009, there were 110,981,000 Americans employed in the private-sector. So the United States lost 653,000 private-sector jobs on Bush's watch.
   
That made it easy for Pelosi: If the United States had netted even one private-sector job in 2010, she'd be accurate. And the nation actually did quite a bit better than that. Private-sector employment in January 2010 was 106,793,000, a number that grew to 107,570,000 by September 2010. That worked out to 777,000 jobs created. (The numbers here are sightly different from what we reported in our original item, due to after-the-fact numerical revisions by BLS.)

But we noted at the time that Pelosi had cherry-picked the data, choosing a time frame favorable to Obama. If she'd instead chosen to start from the beginning of Obama's term -- rather than half way through his first two years -- she would have been stuck with a net loss of 3.4 million private-sector jobs, not the increase of 777,000 she came up with for the first eight months of 2010. Pelosi essentially started counting from the low point for jobs and only counted the upward part of the trendline.
   
Meanwhile, the start and end points she used for Bush give the former president no such break. The jobs picture under Bush looked like an arc, heading generally upward through mid 2007 before heading downward again. If she had used only the upward portion of the arc, as she did for Obama, it would have showed a gain of roughly 4 million private-sector jobs.

On balance, we gave Pelosi’s October 2010 statement a rating of Half True -- right on the numbers, but misleading due to cherry-picking.

Pelosi’s second offering, in May 2011, earned a lower rating, since she misstated a portion of the talking point.

During a May 16, 2011, interview with Bloomberg television, Pelosi said, ""In the first year of the Obama administration, more jobs were created in the private-sector than in the eight years of the Bush administration, with all of the tax cuts that President Bush had."" This time, she pointed to the first year of the Obama Administration -- January 2009 through January 2010 -- when the economy shed almost 4.2 million private-sector jobs.

So while job growth under Bush was anemic by historical standards, it was still better than the 4.2 million jobs lost under Obama. That means Pelosi was wrong, and we rated the claim False.

Pelosi’s new statement

Pelosi’s statement from last weekend continues the cherry-picking approach: She cited numbers only for jobs created in 2010.

Using the period January 2010 to December 2010, the number of private-sector jobs increased by more than 1.2 million. If Pelosi had used more current numbers, she actually would have had a stronger case: From January 2010 to August 2011, the increase in jobs was almost twice as big -- nearly 2.4 million.

Even the smaller of these two numbers beats Bush’s eight-year jobs increase -- but she continues to conveniently ignore the first year of the Obama administration. If you take the entirety of Obama’s term -- January 2009 to August 2011 -- the nation has lost 1.8 million jobs, which is still worse than what happened under Bush.

Nadeam Elshami, a spokesman for Pelosi, argues that it’s proper to keep the first year of Obama’s tenure out of the equation.

""Republicans may wish to wipe the slate clean and forget about the financial crisis that nearly destroyed our economy and the recession that began under President Bush,"" said Elshami, a spokesman for Pelosi. ""The figures are correct and clearly demonstrate that private-sector jobs are being created, but not fast enough – we have much more to do, and we urge Republicans to join us to pass President Obama’s American Jobs Act.""

We understand the impulse to make such adjustments, but in Pelosi’s formulation, this principle is applied unequally. If the first year of the Bush administration, which also included a recession, were excluded from her calculation-- this would have magically erased a loss of 2.4 million jobs under Bush. The next seven years of the Bush presidency would have shown a gain of nearly 1.8 million jobs, rather than a loss of 653,000 for the full eight-year period. 
Interestingly, if Pelosi had started the count for each president at the beginning of the second year of their presidencies, it would not only have been more defensible methodologically, but it would have also backed up Pelosi's argument better. Leaving out the first year for each president, private-sector job growth under Obama would have been 2.4 million, compared to 1.8 million under Bush. 
However, in none of the three statements by Pelosi that we've fact-checked did Pelosi use that method. 
Our ruling 
Pelosi compared a select time frame in the Obama administration against the entire length of the Bush administration -- a methodology that treats the two presidents unequally. The irony is that if she had used better methodology, she would have had a sounder argument that more private-sector jobs were created under Obama than under the Bush administration. For her general point, we give Pelosi some credit. For her methodological sins -- repeated at least three times -- we give her thumbs down. On balance, we rate her statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/20/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-jobs-increased-faster-2010-8-yea/

Oregon Labor Commissioner investigates 300 housing complaints a year?
","
The Bureau of Labor and Industries enforces Oregonians’ civil rights in housing and employment. Last week, Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian took to public radio to talk about his role in enforcing federal fair housing laws.

""We do about 300 investigations a year into housing discrimination and in recent years have put about $150,000 of damages into the pockets of individuals who have been treated unfairly,"" he said.

That seemed easy enough to check. We searched online the words Avakian, housing and complaints, and found an April 2010 press release in which his office claimed investigating more than 200 complaints since May 2008. Two hundred in two years versus 300 a year? We asked the commissioner’s office to reconcile.

Bob Estabrook, the commissioner’s spokesman, owned up to the discrepancy right away. He said the commissioner misspoke. An August 2011 check found roughly 350 housing investigations since May 2008, when BOLI was reauthorized to investigate federal housing claims. That comes out to more than 100 complaints a year, not the 300 a year claimed.

As for the money, Estabrook said he couldn’t release dates or other details, because some of the information may be confidential or not easily available. But he said 67 complaints were settled privately, between the parties, or settled at agency prompting.

Of the 67 cases, 31 included monetary exchanges totaling almost $160,000. The amounts ranged from $500 to $20,000. It’s not all technically ""damages,"" but it is money that probably would not have gone to complainants without intervention by the agency, he said.

PolitiFact Oregon can’t verify the dollar amounts, but we can rule on -- and tell you more about -- the number of cases.

A BOLI database shared with The Oregonian shows 339 housing cases through early August 2011. Of those:
  
- There were 77 complaints in calendar year 2008. 
- There were 88 complaints in 2009. 
- There were 108 complaints in 2010. 
- There were 66 complaints through early August 2011.   
- There are 75 cases currently under investigation. 
- There were 141 cases closed with no substantial evidence of discrimination. 

Avakian’s claim of 300 a year is clearly inaccurate. We give his office points for admitting he misspoke -- that’s a good thing in a politician -- and under some circumstances that might cause us to ignore the flub.

But Avakian is in a special election race for Congress, making his record as a state official that much more important for voters to understand. To correct that record, we rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2011/sep/20/brad-avakian/oregon-labor-commissioner-investigates-300-housing/
