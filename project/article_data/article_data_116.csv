Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca says two-thirds of Wisconsinites strongly opposed Governor Scott Walker's limits on collective bargaining
","
On the night the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the sharp limits on public-sector collective bargaining, Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca (D-Kenosha) denounced the move.

Barca told a national cable TV audience on June 14, 2011 that the plan advocated by Gov. Scott Walker and passed by his Republican colleagues in the Legislature was wildly unpopular in Wisconsin.

""Two thirds of the people in Wisconsin strongly disagree with this idea of permanently taking away people’s rights to collective bargaining,"" Barca told Ed Schultz, the liberal host of MSNBC’s ""The Ed Show.""

Like others, Barca is closely watching public reaction to the GOP move -- particularly now that nine recall elections spurred by the legislative battle could tip control of the Senate from the Republicans to Democrats.

Back in February and March, during the heat of the battle, Walker was coming out on the short end in many surveys released iby independent and politically connected groups.

But a two-thirds majority against the GOP plan?

And not just opposed, but strongly opposed, which is a narrower category used by pollsters?

When we asked Barca to back up his two-thirds claim, he pointed to polls by USA Today/Gallup and Bloomberg National, as well as surveys conducted for the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative Wisconsin think tank, and for the AFL-CIO and a liberal group, Building a Stronger Wisconsin.

Some reach two-thirds opposition, and others get there if you add in the margin of error, said Melanie Conklin, Barca’s spokesperson.

First, a note of caution.

There are great variations in the way questions on polls are worded and the group that is measured (all adults, likely voters, etc.) and the scope of the poll (state, national). Results can be influenced timing, and some are done by groups with a stake in the fight.

Thus, for Barca to be on the money, he has to be accurately describing what the polls asked as well as the numerical results.

We’ll look at the polls Barca cited, as well as others made public at the time. We’ll start with polls that were unaffiliated with the players in the controversy.

USA Today/Gallup: The USA Today/Gallup poll released Feb. 22, 2011 asked adults across the country if they favored Wisconsin-style bargaining limits in their state. A total of  61 percent opposed such limits, 33 percent favored them. But that number was not Wisconsin specific.

Bloomberg: The Bloomberg National Poll released March 9, 2011 found that 64 percent of Americans think public employee unions should have the right to collectively bargain for wages. This poll also was national in scope.

Another issue: That poll frames the question around support for collective bargaining for wages. The Wisconsin plan limits how much wages can increase, but does not eliminate bargaining on wages. So, it’s not clear how that poll question backs Barca’s claim.

Now let’s take a look at the surveys by organizations either working for one of the players, or often tagged as having partisan or ideological leanings.

Barca cited two questions on the poll from the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative group. That poll, conducted in late February and early March, focused on Wisconsin adults.

In one question, 65 percent of respondents thought Walker should compromise and negotiate with Democrats and labor rather than stand strong, the poll found. In the other, 60 percent opposed a specific compromise.

But neither of those is directly on point to Barca’s statement.

We found a question that was closer: It found 51 percent opposed to Walker’s plan, which the poll described as reducing employee benefits, limiting bargaining rights and changing rules to make unions do more work to remain certified and collect dues. Another 46 percent favored the governor’s ideas.

Another poll cited by Barca, conducted for the state AFL-CIO  found that among Wisconsin likely voters, 67 percent agreed with position taken by public employees in the dispute.

That’s the two-thirds mark – but it doesn’t mean that only one-third agreed with Walker.

Respondents in the poll were not asked to choose one side or the other; rather they were asked to rate whether they agreed with the position of each of several individuals or groups. Walker’s position won 43 percent approval, and Republicans in the Legislature, 48 percent.

We found a larger poll for the labor organization asked a detailed question that focused directly on Walker’s plan. The response: 52 percent were opposed (Of that, 41 percent were strongly opposed).

The final poll cited by Barca was one done for the liberal group Building a Stronger Wisconsin. That statewide poll of likely voters was conducted by The Shop Consulting Inc., a Madison-based firm that polls for liberal and Democratic clients.

It found 65 percent of state voters opposed stripping employees of most of their collective bargaining rights. Based on our review, that was the high water mark for the pro-union side.

We also found two Wisconsin polls of likely voters, conducted by Rasmussen Reports, an electronic media company.

One poll found 52 percent opposed weakening collective bargaining rights of state employees. A second poll, also in March, found 57 percent  against weakening those rights. Rasmussen has been criticized by Democrats as a GOP-leaning firm, but it describes itself as independent and does not do commissioned polling for partisan groups.

University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist Charles Franklin, a nationally recognized polling expert, said the lack of recent polls and relative dearth of state-specific polls made hard-and-fast conclusions difficult.

But he said the consistency of the various polls -- he has compiled a list -- is pretty good evidence that the ceiling for opposition is in the upper 50 percent range to 60 percent.

He called a two-thirds claim of opposition a stretch and Barca’s claim that  two-thirds ""strongly"" disapprove an even bigger one.

Franklin expressed mixed feelings about The Shop Consulting Poll that found 65 percent opposition. It has to be taken into account, he said, but is an outlier in its finding.

Franklin noted it was not an independent poll, though he did credit the group for releasing the survey questions. But he argued that the setup question tilted anti-Walker by starting off, ""Rather than negotiate with public employees..."" Lance Walter, co-founder of Shop Consulting, defended the fairness of the polland noted the lead-in was factual.

It’s crucial to note that Barca set the bar even higher than general opposition of two-thirds.

He said two-thirds ""strongly"" oppose the change.

The WPRI poll had 42 percent ""strongly"" opposed to Walker’s plan and 9 percent ""somewhat"" opposed. And the poll for the AFL-CIO measured the ""strongly opposed"" group at 41 percent. The poll for Building a Stronger Wisconsin did not break out a category for strongly opposed.

So, let’s return to the claim at hand.

Barca said ""two thirds of the people in Wisconsin strongly disagree with this idea of permanently taking away people’s rights to collective bargaining."" To be sure, the polls showed general opposition.

But Barca has scant evidence of a two-thirds majority (some of the polls he cites are national ones), and no leg to stand on in claiming two thirds of Wisconsinites ""strongly disagreed."" That’s a specific measure pollsters use. In polling, a few percentage points either way can be highly significant. Here, Barca missed the bull's-eye by more than that.

We find his statement False.

State Rep. Ron Amstutz says most of the state budget is spent at the local level
","
Gov. John Kasich aimed to plug a projected $8 billion budget shortfall when he announced a two-year spending proposal including big cuts to education and local government. The budget cuts drew criticism from angry school officials, among others.

The cuts and the anger also concerned state Rep. Ron Amstutz. As chairman of the House Finance and Appropriations Committee, the Wooster Republican had the job of steering the budget through the House.

He called local governments ""our partners,"" and he said changes would be made in the controversial blueprint for funding schools. But the veteran lawmaker said that cutting the size of state government was not an alternative that would cover the budget gap.

""Most of the state budget isn't for state government doing things,"" he told a public forum at the Idea Center on Playhouse Square. Most of the budget, he said, goes to such recipients as school districts, local governments, school districts, hospitals, nursing homes and libraries.

""The state doesn't do much direct service,"" Amstutz said. ""Eighty-five percent of the state budget is transferred to local communities for delivery of service.""

That's a hefty percentage. We asked Amstutz how it was figured.

His office provided a budget overview for fiscal 2010 that was prepared by the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission.

A breakdown of spending shows that 85.6 percent of the spending in the General Revenue Fund, the primary operating fund of the state, goes to the category of ""subsidies."" The total for subsidies is about $20.7 billion of a total $24.1 billion.

The Legislative Service Commission then provided us with a breakdown of that spending. Two departments account for nearly $17 billion. The Department of Job and Family Services, which handles Medicaid and unemployment compensation, tops the list with about $9.2 billion. The Department of Education, for grades K-12, is budgeted at $7.6 billion.

Amstutz told us he was referring to the General Revenue Fund because it’s money over which the General Assembly has control.

In the larger all funds budget, which is less discretionary and includes agencies funded completely by fees and federal money, subsidies account for 66 percent of spending, Amstutz said.

A breakdown of the all-funds budget in the Legislative Service Commission report puts subsidies at 66.6 percent of the $55.87 billion in spending for Fiscal 2010. That's still two-thirds of the total, or most of it.

So how does Amstutz’ claim fare on the Truth-O-Meter?

Amstutz said that most of the state budget isn't for state government doing things and that 85 percent of the money goes back to local communities for services.

When we talked to Amstutz and he mentioned the 85 percent figure and specifically referred to the general revenue fund. The budget overview prepared by the Ohio Legislative Service Commission shows he’s right on the money with that figure.

So Amstutz’ statement is essentially accurate.

Also to be considered is the all-funds budget. The percentage of money that goes back to communities is smaller, about 67 percent, but it still matches the description of ""most"" that he used at the Ideastream forum. That’s a piece of additional information that provides full understanding.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Amstutz' statement rates as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/22/ron-amstutz/state-rep-ron-amstutz-says-most-state-budget-spent/

MALDEF lawyer says Latinos left no better off than 20 years ago under redrawn congressional districts
","
A lawyer viewing a proposed Republican redo of congressional districts laid out in late May saw no additional gains for Hispanic representation even though ""65 percent of the state's growth over the past decade was comprised of Latinos.""

Nina Perales, vice president of litigation for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said in a May 31 press release that the map just unveiled by Republican legislators ""gerrymanders more than nine million Latinos in Texas to make sure that we have no more electoral opportunity than we did in 1991.""

That’s a heavy charge considering Latino population growth has been key to the state gaining six U.S. House seats since the 2000 census.

Is MALDEF’s claim accurate?

Let’s start with a dash of law and a 20-year flashback.

As noted in a February draft report by the Texas Legislative Council, U.S. Supreme Court decisions bar any state from drawing congressional districts intentionally diluting the ""voting strength of members of a racial or ethnic minority group.""

The Voting Rights Act of 1965, amended in 1982, is the ""most important law protecting the voting rights of racial and ethnic minority groups,"" the report says, because of provisions requiring certain jurisdictions, including Texas, to obtain prior federal approval of any redistricting plan. The act also allows members of a racial or language minority group to challenge a plan limiting or diminishing their opportunity to participate in elections and to elect candidates of their choice.

Redistricting expert Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School, told us the court has interpreted the act to mean jurisdictions must protect the voting power of a group of racial and ethnic minorities if it’s large enough, compact enough and cohesive enough--and would not be able to exercise political power if the electoral process was left to its own devices.

Now, the flashback: Lawmakers in 1991 designed two of three added House districts as ""opportunity"" districts giving Latino voters a good shot at electing candidates of their choice. Frank Tejeda, a Democratic state senator, then captured the San Antonio-rooted 28th district, while voters in Houston’s 29th district advanced another senator, Democrat Gene Green.

Texas wound up with seven Latino-opportunity districts, a number that did not change after last decade’s redistricting.

How do those opportunity districts shake out under the map offered in May?

For starters, the map breaks up the state into 36 districts, counting four districts gained courtesy of population increases this past decade. Two new districts, one in the Houston area, the other in Dallas-Fort Worth, are not considered minority-opportunity districts.

Another, the 34th district, stretches from Brownsville in Cameron County to Hidalgo County north toward Corpus Christi and is 82 percent Hispanic. But observers do not view the district as a Latino-opportunity gain; it’s a swap for the current Latino-opportunity district rooted in Corpus Christi and carried in 2010 by Republican Blake Farenthold.

Then again, the remap includes the new 35th district running from East Austin into San Antonio. Its overall population is 63 percent Hispanic, according to information compiled by the legislative council; 45 percent of its 2010 registered voters had Spanish surnames. Perales told us Latino voters could elect the candidate of their choice in the district.

This appears to give the state an additional Latino-opportunity district compared with 1991.

Not so, Perales said, because it’s offset by redraws of San Antonio’s 20th district and the 23rd district stretching west from San Antonio that dilute Latino voting power.

Among factors she aired: The share of Spanish-surnamed voters in the 20th district, which is represented by Charlie Gonzalez, would drop from 58 percent now to 49 percent. In the 23rd district, where Democrat Rick Noriega bested GOP U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in 2008, Cornyn prevails in the redrawn version.

""If you create a new opportunity and you take away an opportunity, there’s no net gain,"" Perales said.

State Sen. Kel Seliger, R-Amarillo, who chairs the Senate Redistricting Committee, told us lawmakers had to shift Hispanic residents from Gonzalez’s district to ensure the new Austin-to-San Antonio district would be a Latino-opportunity district. He urged us to visit further with Austin lawyer Bob Heath, an adviser to the committee.

Heath said it’s hard for legislators to create more Latino-opportunity districts because the Hispanic population is younger than the rest of Texas, and its proportionate share of voting-age residents is smaller. He said too that such residents aren’t always geographically concentrated and Latino voter registration and turnout tends to run low in part because there are more Latino non-citizens than in other subgroups.

Heath said that in his opinion, he said, the 20th district is ""always going to elect an Hispanic in the Democratic primary and the Democrat is going to win."" He declined to comment on the 23rd district.

No doubt, appraising opportunity districts is tricky. ""This is why political scientists get paid every 10 years, for taking all the factors into account"" and judging districts, Levitt said. ""It’s nuanced.""

It’s also subject to legal argument. Courts have been asked to judge the redo of congressional districts that ultimately won legislative approval.

Our judgment: If MALDEF’s characterizations stick, the May remap promised six to seven Latino-opportunity districts -- at best the same as 1991.

But if Republican defenders are correct, the remap offers eight Latino-opportunity districts--a one-seat bump. However, the proportion of Latino-opportunity seats circa 2012--22 percent--would be virtually unchanged in 20 years. That’s because greatly Latino population growth has helped Texas edge to 36 total seats, compared to 30 in 1991.

"['Oregon', 'National Republican Congressional Committee']","
Is Kurt Schrader at fault for maxing out government 'credit card'?
","
Rep. Kurt Schrader is neither drunken (as far as we know)  nor is he a sailor.

But that’s not the portrait the National Republican Congressional Committee paints of Schrader, the second-term Democrat from Oregon who is likely to face another tough campaign in 2012.

The NRCC is in the business of electing Republicans and defeating people like Schrader. So it’s not surprising that on May 18 the organization sent out a news release accusing Schrader of spending federal tax dollars like a drunken sailor and blaming him for pushing government debt to the $14.3 trillion limit.

""Kurt Schrader and his fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out,"" the press release said.

That’s a pretty exact, and if true, damning statement at a time when most voters are highly worried about the nation’s debt and not enamored with any politician who’s prone to go on ""spending sprees.’’

So let’s take a look to determine if it stands up.

Our government gets some of the cash it needs by borrowing from foreign governments and other investors. As happens when your bills come due and your current income cannot keep up, the United States now needs to borrow even more. To get the money, Congress first must approve a debt limit higher than the current one of $14.294 trillion.

This is a lot like living on a credit card and asking the bank for a higher limit, an analogy that Republicans happen to like. In an attack used in some variation against Schrader and 58 other House Democrats, the NRCC also claimed that Schrader and his fellow Democrats ""went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out.""

But is it the fault of Schrader and House Democrats that the federal credit card has been maxed out?

Not exactly.

You might remember the tax cuts championed by congressional Republicans and former President George W. Bush, tax cuts that were extended in December for two years under Democratic President Barack Obama. While some economists say these were needed to give the economy a kick, they also meant less money came in from tax revenue.

Before the most recent extension, the Congressional Research Service said that the Bush tax cuts, with a 10-year price tag of $1 trillion, played a substantial role in the nation’s annual deficits. Some will argue that tax cuts can actually pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth, but PolitiFact has previously found that the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers say that tax cuts lead to revenues that are lower than they otherwise would have been – even if they spur some economic growth.

Last year, the Congressional Budget Office said that extending all of them permanently, as many in the GOP would like, would cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years and increase deficits.

Then there’s the recent economic downturn, which also played a role. And the nation is still engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with billions of dollars flowing out to pay for them. These began during the Bush years and continue under Obama. Schrader wasn’t in Congress when the war started. He has voted both for and against funding since he was elected.

Despite the intensity of the recent debate, altering the debt ceiling - almost always up - has been routine practice in Washington for generations. The ceiling reflects the real world. With ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, a deep recession and less revenue as a result of tax cuts enacted under former President George W. Bush, the gap between income and expenses has widened.

""Since March 1962, Congress has enacted 74 separate measures that have altered the limit on federal debt,"" the Congressional Research Service said in a May report. The CRS is Congress’ non-partisan and independent analytical organization.

""Most of these changes in the debt limit were, measured in percentage terms, small in comparison to changes adopted in wartime or during the Great Depression. Some recent increases in the debt limit, however, were large in dollar terms. For instance, in May 2003, the debt limit increased by $984 billion and in February 2010 the debt limit was increased by $1.9 trillion,"" the CRS report said.

The case is even more difficult to make against Schrader since he is actively involved with the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrats, whose sole purpose in life is to restrain federal spending.

In fact, Schrader chaired the group’s Fiscal Responsibility Task Force, which aims to restrain federal spending and reduce debt. In that capacity, Schrader helped write a budget proposal earlier this year that called for $100 billion less spending over the next 10 years.

Schrader has repeatedly called for President Obama to use recommendations offered by the president’s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. He also voted against extending the tax cuts enacted by former-President Bush and he has returned $180,000 in unused funds from his own congressional account.

To say that Schrader ran up the credit card is a pithy political slogan, but it ignores all the other spending and borrowing that factored into the debt. Were the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the tax cuts the chief culprits? Democrats say yes. Conservatives disagree, saying that amounts to cherry picking and ignores all other spending.  

Before ruling, we’re compelled to point out that since 2001, Congress has voted to raise the debt ceiling ten times, according to the Congressional Research Service. Seven of those hikes were under Bush, three under Obama.

Schrader, like most Democrats, has selectively voted to boost spending. But he’s also offered proposals calling for deep and specific cuts. The NRCC attack ignores both the facts and the basic history of spending decisions that predate Schrader’s arrival in Congress but which contribute to the fiscal reality that lawmakers and all Americans must face. Taken together, those oversights are substantial and the reason we rate this claim: False.

Newark Mayor Cory Booker says ACLU sought monitor for police rather than investigation
","
Newark Mayor Cory Booker says he’s ""relieved and enthusiastic"" about working with the U.S. Department of Justice as it probes allegations made by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey against the city police department.

That wasn’t always the case.

Nine months ago, Booker and Newark Police Director Garry McCarthy criticized an ACLU petition to the Justice Department calling for outside intervention to deal with more than 400 allegations of excessive force, brutality and other claims against Newark police.

Booker now says that what he was really resistant to in September 2010 was that ""the ACLU didn’t call for an investigation, they called for an immediate federal monitor,"" according to his May 10 interview with Jami Floyd on the Brian Lehrer radio show at WNYC-FM.

WNYC’s Floyd called Booker on his apparent change of opinion as she segued from a discussion about the city’s weekend peace summit into the Department of Justice petition:

""You know I’ve got to ask, the DOJ yesterday announcing its investigation into the Newark Police Department back in September when the NJCLU Civil Liberties Union requested intervention, I think it’s fair to say you and your police chief were resistant to that idea, and yesterday you sounded like you thought it it was a good thing,"" Floyd said to Booker.

Booker responded: ""Well, actually, what we were specifically resistant to is the ACLU didn’t call for an investigation, they called for an immediate federal monitor, which was almost to the point of being ridiculous, so we immediately reached out to the DOJ and asked them to help us to get this cloud off of our police department, but more importantly, when I started talking to Tom Perez’s team we realized very quickly that the DOJ had worked with many police departments around the country helping them to improve their practices."" Perez is the assistant attorney general for Civil Rights.

Really? PolitiFact New Jersey has found legal documents that say otherwise.

The ACLU on Sept. 9, 2010, filed a petition with the Justice Department. The document’s first sentence reads ""The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey of New Jersey (""ACLU-NJ"" or ""Petitioner"") respectfully requests that the Special Litigation Section, acting pursuant to its authority under 42 U.S.C. § 14141, commence an investigation into the Newark, New Jersey Police Department (""NPD"").""

After seven paragraphs summarizing alleged abuses by the Newark Police Department, the petition then states ""On behalf of the people who live in, work in, and visit the City of Newark, New Jersey, we implore the Civil Rights Division to investigate the NPD.""

Use of a federal monitor is mentioned as an option in addition to an investigation, in the final pages of the petition:

""For all of the foregoing reasons, the Petitioners respectfully ask the United States Department of Justice, Special Litigation Section, to forthwith commence an investigation into the Newark, New Jersey Police Department. Thereafter, DOJ should impose remedial steps upon the NPD, including but not limited to: (a) alterations to the citizen complaints and internal affairs processes; (b) an enhanced risk management system; (c) enhanced training; (d) alterations to the disciplinary process; and (e) an independent monitor to oversee compliance.""

PolitiFact New Jersey asked the ACLU about Booker’s comments on the radio broadcast.

""It’s simply not true,"" said Alexander Shalom, the ACLU’s policy counsel. ""The petition is pretty clear in its language. The first page of the petition requests the Special Litigation Section commence an investigation into the police department.""

So what does Booker have to say about this? He declined to comment to PolitiFact New Jersey, according to spokeswoman Anne Torres.

To review: The mayor tried to downplay the controversy by saying the ACLU called for a federal monitor of the Newark Police Department instead of requesting an investigation. Yet the first sentence of the ACLU’s petition to the Department of Justice requests an investigation. 
We rate Booker's statement False.

Gov. Rick Scott says Canadians love Florida beaches and houses
","
Fresh off a five-day trade mission to Canada, Florida Gov. Rick Scott was eager to drop a few tidbits about the country's relationship with the Sunshine State. 
In a news conference with the Capitol press corps on June 16, 2011, Scott showed off his Florida-Canada knowledge, claiming that: 
• ""Almost 10 percent of Canadians came to visit Florida last year."" 
• And, ""they buy 7.4 percent of our homes in the state."" 
Interesting claims, eh? But true? 
The number of Canadians visiting Florida each year is collected by Visit Florida, the state's official tourism marketing corporation. Visit Florida bases its data on credit card information and statistics supplied the Canadian government. The agency found that about 3.05 million Canadians visited Florida in 2010. That's about 9 percent of the country's total population of about 34 million. 
The Toronto Star noted in a recent story -- based on the Visit Florida data -- that the Canadian boost to Florida's tourism happened even as oil from the Deepwater Horizon disaster threatened Gulf of Mexico beaches. 
So Scott is right about the tourists. But what about Canadian homeowners? 
Scott's press office directed us to a 2010 study on Florida's international home buyers. The study is researched by the National Association of Realtors, which creates an annual report on the country's housing market and additional reports for states with a high rate of sales to foreign buyers. The national group takes a survey of Florida members each year, and that includes a question about foreign clients. 
Florida has the strongest international home sales market in the country. In 2010, foreign clients were responsible for 22 percent of existing home purchases in the state, according to the study. 
""Florida has consistently been the No. 1 destination among foreign buyers,"" said Lawrence Yun, a National Association of Realtors economist. 
And Canadians are a big part of that distinction. They out-bought all international buyers in 2010, accounting for 36 percent of Florida's foreign sales in 2010. United Kingdom residents are the next-best buyers at 15 percent. 
Sure, residents of the Great White North love the state's beaches and toasty climate. What's more, Yun said, is that these slices of paradise don't cost nearly as much as they used to, and the Canadian dollar is stronger than its weakened U.S. counterpart. There's greater consumer confidence among Canadians, which is not a bad thing for Florida. 
""It's absolutely helpful,"" Yun said. ""Anytime the market is down, one way to help alleviate the pain or help the healing process is for buyers to come into the market and absorb the inventory."" 
We wanted to find the percentage of Canadians who bought homes in Florida in 2010. So we multiplied 0.22 (portion of Florida home sales to foreign buyers in 2010) by 0.36 (Canada's share of international sales among foreign buyers) to get 0.0792. That's 7.92 percent. 
Scott's office did not specify how he arrived at 7.4 percent, but he's close enough. 
He's right that there's a clear Canadian infatuation with Florida. As one Canadian-turned-Floridian-real-estate-agent joked in a National Public Radio report on the housing phenomenon, ""If there ever was an 11th (Canadian) province, it probably would be Florida."" 
Scott has his Canada trivia down cold, and we were unable to find any statistics that contradict him. We rate his claim True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/21/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-canadians-love-florida-beaches/

Numbers back up Gingrich job growth claim
","Former Georgia congressman Newt Gingrich made a claim during last week’s CNN debate of Republican presidential candidates that was like red meat to conservatives who complain that government is trying to force employees to join unions.

""The right-to-work states are creating a lot more jobs today than the heavily unionized states,"" said Gingrich, the former U.S. House Speaker who now lives in Virginia.

Is that true? We wanted to check.

First, let’s explain what is a right-to-work state. In right-to-work states, employees can decide whether or not they want to join or financially support a union. There are 22 states, including Georgia, with right-to-work laws. Most of those states are in the South, the Plains region and parts of the West.

The right-to-work issue became a political thunderstorm earlier this year when some Republican leaders in Wisconsin wanted to strip bargaining rights from public-sector union workers and pass legislation to make it a right-to-work state. Many Republican leaders across the country complain it’s more difficult for the economy to flourish in strong union states.

Gingrich is part of the right-to-work crowd. A campaign spokesman, R.C. Hammond, suggested we go back a decade to examine his claim. The ""historical trend is overwhelming,"" Hammond told us in an e-mail.

Gingrich’s argument is apparently rooted in data from the National Institute for Labor Relations Research. Between 1999 to 2009, it found job growth rose in right-to-work states by 3.7 percent and fell in ""forced-unionism states"" by 2.8 percent.

The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation conducted similar research from 2000 to 2010 in the 22 right-to-work states and found there was a less than 1 percent increase in private-sector job growth and a 5.5 percent decline in the other 28 states. Foundation official Stanley Greer stressed to us that they don’t believe right-to-work guidelines are the sole factor for private-sector job growth, but still are a ""very important factor.""

The Economic Policy Institute, an organization that says its goal is to raise the economic status of low- and middle-income Americans, argues that right-to-work laws ""have not succeeded in boosting employment growth in the states that have adopted them,"" according to a March report. Two researchers there attributed the job growth in many right-to-work states, particularly the South, to factors that include interstate road improvements and more money spent on education.

All three organizations used the federal government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics for their research. So did we. PolitiFact Georgia compared the number of private-sector jobs in each state from April 2001 to April 2011, the most recent month available. We found 15 of the 22 right-to-work states were among the top 25 states in job growth. North Dakota, which Gingrich hailed during the CNN debate, had the largest increase during that time span, 19.5 percent. The four states with the greatest decrease were all Rust Belt states that have relied on manufacturing: Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana. None of those are right-to-work states. Georgia had the fifth lowest private sector job growth rate.

We also analyzed private-sector job growth since June 2009, which federal officials said was the end of the recent economic recession. North Dakota, again, was at the head of the class and Texas, another right-to-work state, was second. Thirteen of the 22 right-to-work states were among the top 25 states in job growth. Four of the five states with the lowest private-sector job growth rates were not right-to-work states.

Overall, there was a slight increase in the number of private-sector jobs in the 22 right-to-work states during the past decade and post recession. In the 28 other states, there was a small decrease in both time periods.

Nine of the nation’s 10 fastest-growing states over the past decade were right-to-work states. Five of those states -- Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Texas and Utah -- had increases in job growth since April 2001. The population growth in those states may be a factor.

By our analysis, Gingrich’s statement that job growth is higher in right-to-work states has merit. We rate this claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a5a749c3-e5a8-498a-8c86-1990581abcea",/factchecks/2011/jun/21/newt-gingrich/numbers-back-gingrich-job-growth-claim/

Gov. Chris Christie says he doesn’t want to eliminate teacher tenure
","
In the ongoing war of words between Gov. Chris Christie and the New Jersey Education Association, the governor is accusing the teachers union of distorting his proposals for tenure.

""So when the union says I want to eliminate tenure that’s not true,"" Christie said during a speech to students and professors at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. ""Here’s what I want to do with tenure. Based on this evaluation system I want to say after three years where you are judged either effective or highly effective you get tenure and then for every year thereafter where you are rated effective or highly effective you keep tenure and keep all the job protections that go along with tenure. But if you have two years in a row of partially effective or one year of ineffective you lose your tenure rights.""

Once a teacher loses tenure, Christie said, he or she could earn it again with ""three consecutive years of being rated effective or highly effective.""

For this Truth-O-Meter item, we're assessing Christie's claim that his proposal does not abolish tenure. We found it hinges on how the word is defined.

We need to begin by pointing out the governor's contradiction on the issue. In his State of the State address in January, the governor said, ""the time to eliminate teacher tenure is now.""

But now, Christie says he does not want to eliminate tenure -- he wants teachers evaluated annually to keep it. But can that still be called tenure?

No, said the NJEA. Spokesman Steve Baker said Christie’s proposal ""is not tenure"" because that’s not how tenure is defined by state statute.

But Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, which has been more supportive of Christie's proposal, had a more nuanced view. He called it ""renewable tenure.""

A Christie spokesman declined to elaborate, but pointed us to a package of proposals that say they ""fundamentally reform the state’s tenure system.""  

The New Jersey statute that governs the requirements for tenure, 18A:28-5, states that after three consecutive years of employment with a school district, teachers ""shall be under tenure during good behavior and efficiency and they shall not be dismissed or reduced in compensation except for inefficiency, incapacity, or conduct unbecoming such a teaching staff member or other just cause.""

So the law specifies that continued good behavior is necessary to keep tenure.

Another statute states that when a school board reduces the number of teaching staff members, ""dismissals … shall be made on the basis of seniority.""

We found that tenure means different things to different sources -- even dictionaries:

Merriam-Webster: "". . . a status granted after a trial period to a teacher that gives protection from summary dismissal.""

Cambridge dictionary: "" . . . the right to remain permanently in a job.""

Several other dictionaries say tenure is the holding of an office and a guarantee of permanent employment after a probationary period.

The definition gets murkier when politics enter the fray.

Christie pointedly defined tenure in his Harvard speech as ""a job for life after three years and one day,"" a sarcastic line that suggests there is no process for dismissing teachers found to be incompetent.

But Baker, the union spokesman, said, ""Tenure is not a job for life. Never has been. Never intended to be ... Tenure is a fair dismissal process.""

PolitiFact New Jersey also contacted some professors for an independent take on whether Christie's plan can still be called tenure. The consensus was that Christie's plan dramatically changes the program, but that some aspects of tenure would remain in place.

""Tenure is a status that one attains after a period of probation that grants someone the right to remain in that job given good performance and, of course, with due process,"" said Ada Beth Cutler, dean of the College of Education and Human Services at Montclair State University.

""The tenure system as we know it now is going to be eliminated"" if Christie’s proposals become law, she said.  ""But tenure isn’t going to be eliminated.""

Joseph DePierro, dean of Seton Hall’s College of Education and Human Services, called tenure ""due process on steroids."" He says the governor is ""playing a funny game with tenure. It sort of eliminates it, but doesn’t quite eliminate it.""

Bruce Baker, an associate professor at the Rutgers Graduate School of Education and no relation to the NJEA’s Steve Baker, said tenure, as it exists, is ""the assumption of ‘continuous contract’ given satisfactory performance of job duties.""

Whether or not Christie’s proposals change the definition of tenure, Bruce Baker wrote in an e-mail, ""it certainly alters job security in significant ways, and does so with no counterbalancing proposal for significant increases in wages or other benefits.""

For Jeffrey Keefe, an associate professor at Rutgers University’s School of Management and Labor Relations and a research associate for the liberal Economic Policy Institute, the definition of tenure hinges on the ""last in, first out"" system, which would be eliminated under Christie's plan.

""Once you take the seniority clause out, it falls out of my definition of tenure. It becomes pretty meaningless then,"" Keefe said.

So to recap: There is no consensus. The dictionaries don’t agree. And Christie and the NJEA certainly aren’t on the same page.

The only agreement is that Christie’s proposal eliminates tenure as it is now defined in New Jersey. Some said it's reasonable to call that a form of tenure, while others said the word doesn't apply any more.

The governor said his plan doesn't eliminate tenure. But given that experts disagree about how to characterize his plan, we rate the governor’s statement Half True.

Jon Stewart says those who watch Fox News are the ""most consistently misinformed media viewers""
","EDITOR'S NOTE: On the June 21, 2011, edition of The Daily Show, Jon Stewart accepted our False verdict and apologized, saying, ""I defer to (PolitiFact's) judgment and apologize for my mistake. To not do so would be irresponsible.""  On the June 19, 2011, edition of Fox News Sunday, comedian Jon Stewart -- host of The Daily Show on Comedy Central -- sat down for an interview with Chris Wallace. Many readers asked us to review one of his claims.

""Who are the most consistently misinformed media viewers?"" Stewart asked Wallace. ""The most consistently misinformed? Fox, Fox viewers, consistently, every poll.""

Wallace didn’t challenge Stewart’s assertion that Fox -- widely perceived as a conservative-leaning network -- produced more misinformed viewers. But we thought it was an assessment worth checking.

We found two polling organizations that have produced periodic ""knowledge"" surveys differentiated by the respondent’s frequent news sources. One is the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, and the other is worldpublicopinion.org, a project managed by the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland.

Let’s start with Pew’s findings.

Pew periodically studies media usage and public knowledge. They ask whether a respondent is a ""regular"" reader, viewer or listener of major print, television, radio and Internet news sources, and they ask a series of basic factual questions about news and public affairs to gauge how well-informed the respondent is.

After conferring with Pew researchers, we found three surveys since 2007 that shed some light on how informed Fox viewers are compared to consumers of other media. Here they are:

• February 2007 Political Knowledge Survey. Pew asked respondents 23 questions, such as who the vice president is, who the president of Russia is, whether the Chief Justice is conservative, which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives and whether the U.S. has a trade deficit. The ability to answer 15 of these questions correctly earned the respondent a place in the ""high knowledge"" category.

Pew then categorized various media sources by the percentage of their followers who earned a high knowledge rating. The media outlets fell into three categories -- those that had 50 to 54 percent in the high knowledge group, those that had 40 to 49 percent in the high knowledge group, and those that had 34 to 39 percent in the high knowledge group.

In descending order, the 50-to-54 percent group included The Daily Show and its Comedy Central cousin, The Colbert Report; major newspaper websites; the PBS News Hour with Jim Lehrer; Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor; National Public Radio; and Rush Limbaugh’s syndicated radio talk show.

The 40-to-49 percent category included national newsmagazines; television news websites; local daily newspapers; Internet news sources like Yahoo and Google; and CNN.

Finally, the 34-to-39 percent group included the network evening news shows; online news discussion blogs; Fox News Channel; local television news; and the network morning shows.

Now, let’s analyze the data.

Fox isn’t last on the list, although it’s close -- 35 percent of Fox viewers earned a high knowledge rating, which was tied with local television news and was one point ahead of the network morning shows.

However, Fox’s 35 percent score places it exactly at the national average. This seems paradoxical -- Fox ranks near the bottom of a long list of media outlets, yet it sits right at the national average. But there’s an explanation. Lots of respondents reported following none of the media outlets they were asked about, and those respondents did quite poorly on the knowledge quiz -- not surprisingly. That meant that the non-media-using respondents brought down the national average, but they didn’t constitute a separate category that ranked lower than Fox on Pew’s chart.

Since Stewart was referring to ""media viewers,"" this doesn’t undercut his point. However, the data includes an important counterpoint to Stewart’s claim: Viewers of at least one show on Fox scored quite well -- The O’Reilly Factor, of whom 51 percent made it into the high knowledge group. That made it equal to National Public Radio -- a longtime target of conservative complaints about liberal media bias -- and only three percentage points behind Stewart’s own show, at 54 percent.

• April 2008 Media Survey. Compared to the 2007 survey, the 2008 survey looked at a wider variety of media outlets but used a narrower selection of questions designed to test the respondent’s current-affairs knowledge. The pollsters asked three questions: ""Do you happen to know which political party has a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives?"" ""Can you tell me the name of the current U.S. Secretary of State?"" And ""who is the current prime minister of Great Britain?"" Anyone who went three-for-three earned the high knowledge designation.

Here, the range of results was much wider. Once again, Fox News was just about at the national average -- 19 percent of Fox viewers scored in the high knowledge category, compared to 18 percent of all respondents -- but this time a handful of news outlets scored lower than Fox did. With scores ranging from 17 percent all the way down to 9 percent, they were CNBC, local television news, network news, morning news shows, television newsmagazines, personality magazines, religious radio, the Weather Channel, CBS News, Access Hollywood and similar shows, and in last place, the National Enquirer.

And once again, particular Fox shows scored well above the average. Hannity & Colmes was one of only four choices to exceed 40 percent -- the others were the New Yorker/the Atlantic, NPR and MSNBC’s Hardball -- while The O’Reilly Factor scored 28 percent, or 10 points above the national average. (Hannity & Colmes even exceeded Stewart’s Daily Show in this poll, 42 percent to 30 percent.)

In all, this poll undercuts Stewart’s position even more than the 2007 poll did.

• June 2010 Media Consumption Survey. For 2010, respondents were asked four questions -- which party controlled the House of Representatives, what post was held by Eric Holder, which company was run by Steve Jobs and which country has an active volcano that had recently disrupted international air travel. This time, Pew didn’t specifically use a ""high knowledge"" measurement but rather broke down responses by how many were answered correctly by each media outlet’s followers.

Once again, Fox News as a whole ranked fairly low among regularly used media outlets -- 20 percent answered all four correctly and 18 percent answered three correctly. Still, those numbers beat the national average of 14 percent and 20 percent, respectively. (The best-scoring outlet, the Wall Street Journal, posted scores of 51 percent and 23 percent, respectively.)

Fox actually scored better than its two direct cable-news rivals -- MSNBC, which is a liberal counterpoint to Fox, and CNN, which is considered more middle-of-the-road. Also scoring lower than Fox were local television news, the evening network news shows and the network morning shows.

And for the third time, particular Fox shows scored well. Hannity ranked fifth (just ahead of MSNBC’s liberal shows hosted by Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow) and O’Reilly ranked ninth. For the first time, Pew included Glenn Beck in its rankings, and the Fox host finished 12th -- slightly ahead of Stewart’s own Daily Show.

We asked Michael Dimock, Pew’s associate director for research, what he thought Pew’s data meant for Stewart’s claim. He said it’s crucial to understand that different news sources appeal to different types of people -- and that highly political programming of any type attracts regular readers and viewers ""who are, most likely, already highly knowledgeable prior to their exposure to those particular sources. Separating what knowledge they bring with them from what they learn while reading or watching is virtually impossible.""

By contrast, Dimock said, for media outlets with a much broader reach -- including Fox -- ""the average regular consumer of these sources is less informed than the more niche audiences, because these sources, by design, reach and appeal to a broader cross-section of the public. In most of our studies, the regular readers and viewers of these broad-based news sources are not significantly more or less informed than the average American, and there is no systematic pattern showing one broad-based source has a more knowledgeable audience than any other.""

Pew’s methodology is not immune from critique. Most notably, it’s not clear whether knowing the answer to a few current-affairs questions translates into being ""informed."" However, the experts we spoke to said that Pew is an unbiased source and that its data is credible.

Given that, we conclude that the Pew data demonstrates that the reality of who’s ""misinformed"" is a lot more nuanced than Stewart makes it out to be.

Now let’s turn to the studies by worldpublicopinion.org. We found two studies by the group that tracked current-affairs knowledge.

• ""Misperceptions, The Media and The Iraq War"" study, 2003. This study focused on the Iraq War and the lead-up to it. It asked three questions: ""Is it your impression that the U.S. has or has not found clear evidence in Iraq that Saddam Hussein was working closely with the al-Qaida terrorist organization?"" ""Since the war with Iraq ended, is it your impression that the US has or has not found Iraqi weapons of mass destruction?"" And whether, ""The majority of people favor the US having gone to war.""

On these questions, Fox clearly did the worst among the major news outlets. The ""misperception rate"" for Fox was 45 percent. The highest for other news outlets was CBS News at 36 percent; those with lower ""misperception rates"" included CNN, ABC, NBC, the print media and NPR/PBS, which was lowest at 11 percent.

This study is probably the strongest support we found for Stewart’s claim, in part because the difference between Fox and the other news outlets was so stark, and in part because the questions asked have pretty clear-cut ""right"" and ""wrong"" answers.

• Misinformation and the 2010 Election, 2010. This study inspired some of the most intense response of any we looked at. For instance, the liberal blog Daily Kos trumpeted the study with the headline, ""CONFIRMED: New Study Proves That Fox News Makes You Stupid."" But it’s also the study that prompted the fiercest counterattack on methodological grounds.

The study asked 10 questions. Some are fairly cut and dried -- which president signed the TARP law to bail out Wall Street (Bush), which implemented the automaker bailout (both Bush and Obama), whether the stimulus bill included tax cuts (it did),and whether Barack Obama was born in the United States (he was).

But a few were in a bit grayer area, often asking respondents to gauge what experts have concluded about policy trends.

One was, ""Is it your impression that most economists who have studied it estimate that the stimulus has created (a) saved or created several million jobs, (b) saved or created a few jobs, or (c) caused job losses.""

Another was, ""Is it your impression that economists who have estimated the effect of the health reform law on the federal budget deficit over the next 10 years, (a) more think it will not increase the deficit, (b) views are evenly divided, or (c) more think it will increase the deficit.""

The Baltimore Sun’s television critic, David Zurawik, wrote a column shortly after the study appeared, expressing skepticism about the study.

Zurawik wrote, ""what you have for the definition of a respondent who is considered ‘informed’ is essentially someone who agrees with the conclusions of experts in government agencies. When specific questions in the survey are framed around facts, like who was president when a certain piece of legislation passed, you can say someone is misinformed."" But that’s not the case with some of this survey’s questions.

One question from the study that struck us as one that ordinary Americans might answer differently than economists asked, ""Do you think now that the American economy is (a) starting to recover, or (b) still getting worse?"" The study based the ""correct"" answer -- that the economy has begun to recover -- on the widely accepted judgment of when the last recession ended, as well as gross domestic product estimates and statistics for personal income. However, given the phrasing of the question, a respondent might think the question was asking for a personal opinion of how the recovery was going, rather than what the official statistics say.

In a note, the study’s authors acknowledged such concerns, but defended their approach. ""When dealing with topics that have been highly politicized, it is common to default to the position that all perceptions are relative and treatment of any position as more or less true is itself inherently political,"" the study says. ""We believe that such a position is at odds with what is necessary for well-functioning democracy.""

We should note that like this study, PolitiFact often uses the Congressional Budget Office and the Medicare trustees as credible sources, and we often query experts to come up with our rulings. We think there’s a difference between bestowing a False rating on an elected official -- whose job it is to know about public policy -- and calling an ordinary American ""misinformed"" for getting the exact same question ""wrong."" At the very least, these questions seem less clear-cut than asking who the vice president is.

For this reason, we believe that this study should carry less weight in analyzing Stewart’s comment.

So we have three Pew studies that superficially rank Fox viewers low on the well-informed list, but in several of the surveys, Fox isn’t the lowest, and other general-interest media outlets -- such as network news shows, network morning shows and even the other cable news networks -- often score similarly low. Meanwhile, particular Fox shows -- such as The O’Reilly Factor and Sean Hannity’s show -- actually score consistently well, occasionally even outpacing Stewart’s own audience.

Meanwhile, the other set of knowledge surveys, from worldpublicopinion.org, offer mixed support for Stewart. The 2003 survey strikes us as pretty solid, but the 2010 survey has been critiqued for its methodology.

The way Stewart phrased the comment, it’s not enough to show a sliver of evidence that Fox News’ audience is ill-informed. The evidence needs to support the view that the data shows they are ""consistently"" misinformed -- a term he used not once but three times. It’s simply not true that ""every poll"" shows that result. So we rate his claim False.  ",/factchecks/2011/jun/20/jon-stewart/jon-stewart-says-those-who-watch-fox-news-are-most/

In Miami mayor's race, third-party group tries to tie Carlos Gimenez to Carlos Alvarez over car deal
","
The two candidates for Miami-Dade mayor -- Carlos Gimenez and Julio Robaina -- share much in common. Both are Republicans. Both are Cuban-Americans. Both have served in government before -- Gimenez as fire chief, Miami city manager and Miami-Dade county commissioner and Robaina as the mayor of Hialeah. And both need to cast themselves as thrifty reformers as they compete to replace Carlos Alvarez, recalled in March by voters angry about the county doling out raises to most employees amid property tax hikes for homeowners.

Any suggestion that a candidate shares traits in common with Alvarez -- particularly his willingness to spend lavishly on high-level county officials including himself -- could doom a candidate in the June 28 nonpartisan election.

Now comes an ad from a third-party group, The Accountability Project, trying to portray Alvarez and Gimenez as one and the same. What they share -- according to this ad -- are taxpayer-funded luxury cars. The ad starts with an unflattering photo of a grumpy looking Alvarez next to a photo of car keys in the ignition as an ominous voice says: 
""Carlos Alvarez drove a fancy European car at taxpayer expense.""

""Carlos Gimenez also drove a fancy European car at taxpayer expense.""

""Carlos Alvarez: a BMW that we paid for.""

""Carlos Gimenez: a Mercedes-Benz that we paid for.""

""Tens of thousands of tax dollars spent on luxury cars."" 
""Alvarez was the mayor. Gimenez wants to be mayor. Carlos Alvarez and Carlos Gimenez: They can't be part of the solution because both are part of the problem."" 
The ad's message -- complete with images of luxury cars and a TV popping out of a car dashboard -- is clear: Alvarez and Gimenez both wasted taxpayer dollars on luxury cars. Alvarez=Gimenez. The only difference is one drove a BMW and the other, a Mercedes-Benz.

Or is that the only difference?

PolitiFact Florida wanted to take a look under the hood of the car deals for Alvarez and Gimenez. And, since it's relevant, we also decided to examine Robaina's use of city cars when he was Hialeah's mayor. Our ultimate goal is to decide whether the ad fairly compares the political figures based on their taxpayer-funded luxury cars.

First, some background about The Accountability Project. The Electioneering Communication Organization is registered to political consultant Keith Donner who told us in an e-mail June 16 that his ECO is not connected to any campaign but that he is ""absolutely supporting Robaina."" Donner referred us to Herald articles to obtain details about car allowances.

A breakdown man by man, car by car

We did our own research about Alvarez, Gimenez and Robaina and their use of government cars or car allowances. We contacted the Gimenez and Robaina campaigns and officials in Miami-Dade County and Hialeah to attempt to pull together information about the officials' past car allowances.

But first, a general word about making such comparisons. Car allowances -- or the use of city-owned cars -- is one piece of an official's compensation package that may include salary, expenses, health insurance and pensions. We are not providing a full comparison here of every part of the officials' compensation -- but we think its worth looking at the benefit of the car allowance within the context of their salaries and expense accounts. The Miami-Dade Mayor's job is considered full time -- the Herald wrote in 2010 that the mayor earns $233,123, the county commissioner job pays $6,000 a year. The mayor's position in Hialeah is unusual because the mayor, who earns around $155,000 a year, is essentially also the city manager.

Let's look at each official:

Carlos Gimenez

Gimenez was a county commissioner between 2004 and 2011 when he stepped down to run for mayor. In his final year he was earning an annual salary of $6,000 plus about $55,000 in benefits, including the car allowance.

J.C. Planas, an attorney for the Gimenez campaign and a former state legislator, told us in an e-mail that Gimenez was entitled to the same car allowances as all the commissioners. For the last year and a half, Gimenez drove a Mercedes-Benz ML and prior to that a Mercedes-Benz E320.

Gimenez said in a June 16 interview that his most recent car, the Mercedes-Benz ML, was silver, and he thought it was a 2009 car. He said it was $2.44 above the $800 monthly car allowance and that he paid for that out of his own pocket. The Mercedes Benz website lists the 2011 ML at $46,490 (before options are added) and describes its ""unparalleled ride quality"" this way: the car ""offers stylish proof that utility and safety can coexist enthusiastically with performance and luxury. Ruggedly capable, truly versatile and every inch a Mercedes-Benz, it's a vehicle that feels at home anywhere you go."" (We're not certain if the features changed from 2009 but the Kelley Blue Book listed a similar price for the 2009 car.)

Gimenez doesn't dispute that he had a car allowance -- but he said that Alvarez had access to more cars and drivers.

""Here is the difference between me and Alvarez,"" Gimenez said. ""Alvarez had a personal car -- $800 a month. But he also had two SUVs and a set of drivers.""

Gimenez said he drove himself the majority of the time and estimated he used a driver fewer than 10 times in six years.

""Unlike the city of Hialeah where the mayor gets a substantial salary in excess of pretty much any city of the county, county commissioners basically make nothing,"" Planas said. ""Their salary is their benefits -- one of which is their car allowance. They receive the benefit because their salary is so puny.""

Julio Robaina

Robaina was the mayor of Hialeah between 2005 and 2011 when he resigned to run for mayor. His campaign spokeswoman, Ana Carbonell, said in an e-mail that while mayor, Robaina did not receive a car allowance but drove a city-issued 2004 Chevy Tahoe and later a 2009 Chevy Suburban. His last annual salary was $154,655 and he had an expense account of $116,175. During the 2010-11 year, he took a 7 percent insurance contribution deduction, according to Hialeah Acting City Clerk David Concepcion.

Concepcion confirmed that Robaina didn't get a car allowance. Robaina drove a Chevy Tahoe starting in December 2005 through 2007 and then a Chevy Suburban from 2007 until May 2011, Concepcion said in an e-mail.

Though Carbonell, Robaina's spokeswoman, said Robaina had nothing to do with The Accountability Project, we asked her if she thought the ad comparing the car allowances of Alvarez and Gimenez was fair since it omits that Robaina had city-issued cars.

""The issue is the luxury vehicle in economic times the county is facing,"" she said. ""Is it appropriate for county commissioners to drive a luxury vehicle? That's what the ad points to.""

Carlos Alvarez

The Herald has written extensively about the luxury car perks of Miami-Dade county officials.

On May 23, 2010 the Herald wrote that the mayor and commissioners were keeping the perk of taxpayer-subsidized luxury cars although they were slashing more than $400 million in spending. Among those cars were Gimenez's 2009 Mercedes Benz ML 350, and Alvarez's BMW 550i Gran Turismo. That was in addition, the Herald reported, to two county-owned Chevy Suburbans and two drivers Alvarez had access to.

BMW's website lists the price of the BMW at $64,400.

The Herald wrote that the specifications for the bid for a BMW for Alvarez included: ""black sapphire metallic exterior, ivory white and black Nappa leather interiors, ash grain wood trim and 20-inch double spoke wheels.""

The Herald included a list of various commissioners' car allowances: the politicians generally chose 2010 cars including a Lexus, Cadillac, Sawgrass Infiniti, Toyota Prius and a Ford Taurus. Some chose the $800 monthly stipend instead of leasing or renting a car. Starting this fiscal year in October 2010, the benefit was scaled back to $600 a month for the mayor but remained $800 month for commissioners.

After Alvarez was recalled in March, the county returned his leased car early but the county still had to pay most of the tab, the Herald reported April 6, 2011. The county paid the full lease cost up front: $41,849. When the county turned the car in 10 months into a 30-month lease, South Motors BMW gave $4,000 back. 
Gimenez told us -- and Miami-Dade County spokeswoman Vanessa Santana-Penate confirmed -- he took over his lease when he left his commissioner job.

To be clear, car allowances for elected officials aren't unusual in South Florida. Some government entities provide elected officials with a specified car allowance -- like in Broward County and the City of Miami Beach  -- while others provide a more general allowance that can be used toward a car. 
Our ruling 
Let's revisit the claim in the ad from the group attacking Gimenez.

""Carlos Alvarez drove a fancy European car at taxpayer expense. Carlos Gimenez also drove a fancy European car at taxpayer expense."" No one disputes that Alvarez and Gimenez both drove luxury cars paid for by taxpayers. But the ad omits several key facts:

• Taxpayer-funded car deals for elected officials are common. The perk was available to all the Miami-Dade county commissioners. Even Gimenez's opponent Robaina was given cars by the city to drive while he was mayor of Hialeah. While the cars driven by Robaina, a Chevy Tahoe and a Chevy Suburban aren't ""fancy European"" cars, they are nice cars.

• Alvarez and Gimenez did not have identical car deals. Alvarez went shopping for a BMW on the county dime even though he already had access to two Chevys and two police officers to drive him. When Gimenez left the county he said he took over the lease -- unlike Alvarez who left the county on the hook.

• Comparing the car allowances of Gimenez and Alvarez without looking at other pieces of their compensation package provides an incomplete picture of two different jobs. Alvarez earned about 39 times more than Gimenez in salary -- though to be fair Alvarez likely logged many more hours.

It's true that both Alvarez and Gimenez used their county-paid car allowances to drive luxury cars -- either one could have refused the benefit or not used it in full. But the Truth-O-Meter isn't about merely evaluating whether a statement is technically true -- context and telling the full story matters. This ad fails to do that. We rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/20/accountability-project/miami-mayors-race-third-party-group-tries-tie-carl/

GOP senate group says Tim Kaine's stimulus failed to create jobs
","
As Democrat Tim Kaine campaigns for the Senate, Republicans are hoping to link him with the stimulus bill passed by Congress in 2009.

Kaine was governor of Virginia and had just become chairman of the Democratic National Committee when President Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on Feb. 17, 2009. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which works to elect Republicans to the Senate, is saying the stimulus failed to put Americans back to work.

""President Obama and liberal former DNC Chairman Tim Kaine’s $787 billion stimulus failed to create jobs,"" the NRSC said in a June 3 press release.

Did the stimulus really fail to create jobs? Lots of Republicans are saying that, and we thought we’d take a look.

Chris Bond, a spokesman for the NRSC, said the statement is based on Kaine’s assurances in February 2009 that the stimulus would save or create 3 million jobs. Bond also noted that the unemployment rate is at 9.1 percent and has been above 8 percent for 28 months in a row.

But the NRSC press release says nothing about 3 million jobs. The statement simply charges that the stimulus ""failed to create jobs."" This is an old Republicans charge. Earlier this month we gave House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, a False rating when he said the stimulus ""failed to get people back to work.""

Let’s review some of the evidence we found then.

The White House has posted on its stimulus website a listing of jobs funded by the stimulus, breaking it down by state and congressional district. Between February 17, 2009 and March 31, 2011, the U.S. had a reported 573,510 full-time equivalent jobs funded by stimulus fund contracts, grants and loans, which account for one-third of the cost of the stimulus.

Virginia had a reported 11,446 full-time equivalent jobs funded by the stimulus fund contracts, grants and loans.

White House data shows the bulk of the Virginia jobs -- 7,203 full-time equivalent positions -- were in downtown Richmond where the state government relied on stimulus funds to balance budgets from 2009 to 2011. That number may paint an exaggerated picture, however, because the state parceled much of the stimulus money to localities to help support schools.

Charles Pyle, a spokesman for the state’s department of education, said that as of January 2011, Virginia school divisions reported they had saved 5,692 jobs and created another 926 jobs using stimulus money.

A March report by the president’s Council of Economic Advisers estimated that between 2.5 million and 3.6 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2010.

Separately, the council’s report cited four independent analyses by the Congressional Budget Office and three private economic analysis companies. Here’s what the groups found:

*CBO: Between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created.

*IHS/Global Insight: 2.45 million jobs saved or created.

*Macroeconomic Advisers: 2.3 million jobs saved or created.

*Moody’s Economy.com: 2.5 million jobs saved or created.

A side note: We also found it a stretch that the NRSC is giving Obama and Kaine equal ownership of the stimulus. Kaine was governor in 2009 and never voted on the bill nor participated in its drafting. Later, he did emerge as a key spokesman for stimulus as Obama’s hand-picked DNC chairman.

Let’s review.

The NRSC says the stimulus  ""failed to create jobs.""

The stimulus may  not have created as many jobs as Republicans and Democrats hoped. But there’s no doubt it put many people back to work and preserved the jobs of many more. We rate the NRSC statement False. ",/factchecks/2011/jun/20/national-republican-senatorial-committee/gop-senate-group-says-tim-kaines-stimulus-failed-c/

Video accuses Janice Hahn of hiring gang members with taxpayer money as 'gang-intervention specialists'
","
It has been called one of the most offensive political videos ever. It has been denounced as vile, racist and sexist. So, naturally, it went viral on YouTube.

It's only been up a few days, but as of June 17, 2011, the video attack on Los Angeles Councilwoman and Democratic congressional candidate Janice Hahn -- over her support for gang-intervention programs that use former gang members --  had already been viewed a half million times.

What's all the hubbub? The video features a woman dancing on a stripper pole as two rappers hold guns and grab money out of her hot pants. ""Give us your cash b--ch, so we can shoot up the streets. Give us your cash b--ch, so we can buy some more heat,"" they sing. When the woman turns around, there's a demonic version of Hahn's face superimposed.

Putting aside the offensive images in the video, we wondered about the claim at the heart of the attack. It comes via a voiceover at the start of the video: ""In an insane effort to reduce gang violence, Janice Hahn hired hardcore gang members with taxpayer money to be 'gang-intervention specialists.' She even helped them get out of jail, so they could rape and kill again.""

We spoke with the video's unapologetic creator, Ladd Ehlinger, who specializes in viral political videos. Remember the campaign video for Alabama Agriculture Commission candidate Dale Peterson, the rifle-toting cowboy who called his opponent a dummy? Then there was the one from congressional candidate Rick Barber where he had a fictitious conversation with several of the Founding Fathers, ending with George Washington saying through gritted teeth, ""Gather ... your ... armies."" And we can't forget the one that cast Nancy Pelosi as the Wicked Witch of the West. All Ehlinger.

""I think it's only offensive to people who don't have a sense of humor,"" Ehlinger told us.

Critics may call his latest video over-the-top, he said, but it drew attention to a piece of Hahn's record the media was ignoring.

It's true that Hahn, whose district encompasses some gang-ridden neighborhoods of Watts, has been an active advocate for gang prevention programs that include the controversial practice of hiring ex-gang members to act as go-betweens for law enforcement, community activists and gangs. The issue, though, is whether Hahn hired these gang-intervention specialists with taxpayer money and even helped get some of them out of jail.

The allegation is based largely on a 2008 Fox 11 (Los Angeles) story in which investigative reporter Chris Blatchford reported that anti-gang money was going to the gangsters themselves.

In the Fox story, Watts gangster Steven Myrick is seen in a 2006 police video claiming that he ""worked for"" Janice Hahn and ""that's why I'm out (of jail) right now. Miss Hahn got me out like three weeks ago.""

Myrick was released after an arrest for indecent exposure. He was later tied to a 2000 rape and robbery of a woman at gunpoint and was sentenced to life in prison.

The Fox report includes several other examples of men hired as gang-intervention specialists, paid through programs sponsored by the city, who were still actively involved in gang activity.

In the Fox report, Hahn defended the use of ""gang-intervention specialists,"" saying, ""I do know that it takes a different kind of person to be able to speak the language that convinces the shooters to not retaliate. And that's what we've achieved.""

Blatchford asked if that was like making a deal with the devil.

""I see it as keeping the peace in a community that has been plagued with violence,"" Hahn said.

Asked about the use of convicted criminals as gang-intervention specialists, Hahn responded, ""I think you're saying some of these people have been part of the problem in the past. Well, I'm here to say they're part of the solution now. And I think that's positive.""

Two weeks after the Fox 11 report, the Torrance, Calif., Daily Breeze published a story that purported to largely debunk the Fox story.

Reporter Gene Maddaus wrote that a review of the Fox report ""found major flaws that undermine its central allegations. Most notably, records and interviews show that the gang-intervention workers identified in the report have not received city funding. Additionally, a convicted rapist was wrongly identified as a gang-intervention worker, and Hahn was mistakenly accused of providing funds directly to gang workers.""

According to the story, Myrick, who was featured prominently in the Fox report, ""attended a few task force meetings and took an interest in facilitating peace between gangsters. At one point, he was arrested for violating an order to stay out of Imperial Courts [housing project], and his wife came to a meeting to urge Hahn to help get him out.""

""The only thing I've ever done is call and ask what the basis of an arrest was,"" Hahn told the Daily Breeze. ""I never called to get anyone out of jail.""

According to the Daily Breeze, ""Myrick was released and apparently believed that Hahn had pulled strings for him. He was arrested again a few weeks later, in March 2006, on a 'cold hit' from a 6-year-old rape case.""

Despite Myrick's claim that he was getting paid to help facilitate nonviolence, the Daily Breeze reported it could find no evidence that Myrick was paid as a gang-intervention specialist, nor that he ever received city funds.

Other gang-intervention specialists mentioned in the Fox story were reported to have been paid through an organization called Unity One, which the Daily Beeze noted is almost entirely funded with private sources. The story noted that Unity One did receive $60,000 a year from a subcontract with the Toberman Settlement House, with money that originated from the city's Community Development Department. But, the story noted, records showed the the funding went to pay Unity One's president and program manager, and ""Hahn did not obtain that money for Unity One.""

We spoke to Cornell Ward, executive director of Unity One, who acknowledged they do hire ex-gang members to act as gang-intervention specialists. But he said Unity One does not get government funding, and he dismissed the idea that Hahn ever directed any city funds to hire gang-intervention specialists.

 ""She didn't give them a dime,"" Ward said. ""She didn't give us one red cent.""

When we contacted Hahn's campaign, spokesman Dave Jacobson reiterated the point that Hahn did not ""directly"" fund gang-intervention specialists.

Bu that doesn't mean city money doesn't filter to them.

""She (Hahn) did not hire any gangsters,"" said civil rights lawyer and gang expert Connie Rice. ""The city doesn’t pay the intervention specialists directly.""

Rather, Rice said, city funds go to agencies like hers, the Advancement Project in Los Angeles, which then go out and hire intervention specialists. And, she said, it works: violence is down. That's why city and county law enforcement agencies routinely work with organizations that hire former gang members to ""interface"" with the gang community, she said.

""We have to engage with the people doing the damage,"" said Rice.

""Do we talk to actual gangsters, yes,"" Rice said. ""We ask them not to shoot kids. This is the reality. We're trying to save lives, not score political points. It's smart policy.""

Is it controversial? Sure, Rice said. And sometimes some of the people hired for gang-intervention work ""mess up."" Those found to be abusing the system are cut off, she said. That doesn't mean the program isn't working, she said. ""You can throw stones at that,"" Rice said, but the reality is ""when you go into gang-controlled hot spots, you have to deal with the gangs. People don't understand what we're facing out here. In our hots spots, we still have the OK Corral.""

Watts is one of the most dangerous places in the country, she said. And it's in Hahn's district. ""As a councilwoman, she had to do something,"" Rice said.

We asked Hahn campaign spokesman Jacobson whether, if the city pays money to agencies that, in turn, hire ex-gang members as gang-intervention specialists, isn't that the same thing as them being paid with taxpayer money?

""The city funds are used to fund a three-pronged approach to fight the war on gangs,"" Jacobson responded by e-mail. ""That includes funding gang prevention, suppression, and intervention services. In the past couple years, the rules about who gets money have become much, much stricter. And funds do not go to organizations unless they can show that their staffers are not involved in gangs and have gone through a rigorous training program on how to be an effective part of community policing.""

So what about the charge that Hahn ""even helped them get out of jail, so they could rape and kill again."" The only evidence that she intervened in that way comes from Myrick's taped statements to police. Myrick certainly suggests she did.
 
""The entire Fox story was based on statements made by desperate criminal gang members who would say anything to avoid going to jail,"" Hahn said at the time. ""I have never paid these gang members, never had them work for me, nor have I ever helped them to get out of jail.""

Said Fox reporter Blatchford: ""We stand behind everything in our report.""

We should note that Hahn has since filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission alleging the political action committee that paid for the video, Turn Right USA, is connected to the campaign of her Republican opponent. Both Hahn's opponent in the congressional race and Ehlinger vehemently deny that.

Republican Craig Huey, who will face Hahn in a July 12 special election, released a statement condemning the ad, saying it was not authorized or affiliated with his campaign.

""The ad is blatantly racist and sexist, and neither racism nor sexism has any place in the public sphere,"" Huey stated.
 
According to its website, Turn Right USA is ""a non-connected, expenditure only political action committee (SuperPAC), definitely not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee."" Talking Points Memo reported that the group's treasurer said he may resign because, ""I just don't approve of that video.""

For his part, video creator Ehlinger isn't backing off one inch. He said the allegation about Hahn getting gangsters out of jail early comes right from the mouth of Myrick, who is serving a life sentence for rape and robbery. Said Ehlinger: ""I'm going to take him at his word. I trust Myrick's word over Janice Hahn's. And you should, too.""

He added that Hahn is simply hiding behind the fact that she (and the city) didn't give money directly to former gang members.

""No one ever said Hahn pulled money out of her purse and paid them,"" he said.

But the city paid third-party programs that paid these intervention specialists, he said. It may be one step removed, he said, but it amounts to the same thing.

Rice says she welcomes a public dialogue about the controversial practice of using former gang members as intervention specialists. But this video, which she said was made by ""lazy political assassins,"" is not the right way.

""I don't understand why we have to look at it through this false lens that these propagandists ginned up,"" Rice said. If a ""vile, sexist and misogynistic"" video is the only way to get enough attention to have serious discussion about the issue, she said, ""that's bad news for constitutional democracy.""

We're not going to debate the methods people use to get out their political message these days. The reality is that viral political videos, like chain e-mails, often reach a large audience and leave an impression.

So what is the truth? We think the onus falls on the folks making the claim to back it up, and the makers of the video produce no hard evidence to support it. There's ample evidence that Hahn has been an advocate of programs that use ex-gang members as intervention specialists. And while the city does not fund these intervention specialists directly, it funds agencies that do. Still, it's a stretch to say ""Janice Hahn hired hard-core gang members with taxpayer money to be 'gang-intervention specialists.'"" That suggests she selected the ex-gang members tapped to be intervention specialists or that she paid them herself, and there's no evidence of that. 
We also think it's a stretch to accuse Hahn of getting gangsters out of jail based solely on the comments of one gang member facing serious criminal charges. Hahn acknowledges she made a call to to find out the basis for Myrick's arrest. Perhaps that was interpreted by Myrick or police as Hahn intervening on his behalf. Other than Myrick's hearsay declaration, however, the video and its producer present no proof that she did. That's not good enough to give it credibility.

"['Education', 'Health Care', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Sandy Pasch']","
Wisconsin Rep. Sandy Pasch says Sen. Alberta Darling voted to add $1 billion in spending while cutting education and health care
","
As Republicans moved to aggressively cut the two-year state budget in the spring of 2011, state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, praised the move to smaller government and no new taxes.

Meanwhile, state Rep. Sandy Pasch, a Democrat from Milwaukee’s North Shore, fought against the cuts, in particular pushing to save funds for SeniorCare, the state’s drug assistance program for some residents over 65.

Now Pasch is running in a recall election against Darling, co-chair of the Legislature’s budget-writing Joint Finance Committee.

Little surprise she would target Darling’s work on the budget, which makes controversial cuts in education and aid to local governments to close a more than $3 billion shortfall.

Here’s the twist: Pasch argues the final product makes ""a mockery of Senator Darling's claims of fiscal responsibility.""

""Voters in our district would be stunned to learn that all the while Senator Darling is talking about getting the budget under control, she actually voted to add more than $1 billion in additional spending,"" Pasch said in a campaign news release.

Campaign watchers will see this claim repeated by Democrats in this summer’s recall elections. Already state Rep. Fred Clark, D-Baraboo, has launched a similar attack against Sen. Luther Olsen, R-Ripon.

Indeed, both sides are working overtime to put their spin on the budget -- and doing it in some head-spinning ways.

Democrats are hammering their rivals about all the budget cuts, while simultaneously criticizing efforts Republicans made to soften some of the cuts. Republicans are touting their fiscal responsibility but also want credit for adding back some spending to ease some of Walker’s proposals.

Let’s look at Pasch’s claim of a $1 billion spending increase.

Is it true?

Pasch’s campaign pointed us to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau’s accounting of the work of the Joint Finance Committee. The committee, with members of both parties and both chambers, is the first stop for the budget, which won final approval June 16, 2011.

The fiscal bureau scored it this way: The 2011-’13 budget approved by the committee with Darling’s support was $1.1 billion higher than the budget of former Gov. Jim Doyle. That’s including all state and federal funds in the budget, for a 1.8 percent increase.

But there are other ways to look at it.

The committee’s starting point was not Doyle’s last budget, as Pasch’s statement implies, but the newly crafted budget for 2011-’13 from Walker, who had built in a 1 percent spending increase.

When you look at what the committee added compared with the Walker  starting point, the figure is much lower -- $528 million, according to the fiscal bureau. That was possible largely because of revised revenue forecasts, that increased the amount the state is expected to take in.

In any case, both the $528 million and the $1.1 billion figures are appropriate and commonly used, depending on what point is being made, said Bob Lang, director of the fiscal bureau.

And Capitol reporters -- including those from the Journal Sentinel -- have long measured increases by comparing the new budget to the previous year’s budget. That’s the $1.1 billion difference.

In the end, the committee did not go back to Doyle’s budget or even stay with the level of spending Walker introduced.

So Pasch’s claim about the increase seems to be on target.

But there is this caveat, unmentioned by Pasch: According to the fiscal bureau, $154 million of the spending increase stemmed from late-breaking estimates of higher enrollment in state Medicaid programs. The fiscal bureau itself suggested that add-back as an option.

What about the second part of Pasch’s claim -- that Darling, while putting in ""additional spending,"" backed major cuts in education and cuts to SeniorCare?

This one’s a bit more complicated.

Darling did back the Joint Finance Committee version of the budget that
left intact the bulk of Walker’s plans. For example, local school aids dropped by nearly $800 million.

So Darling supported most of Walker’s dramatic cutbacks. But she didn’t support them in total.

It’s worth noting the cut in local school aids would have been $116 million higher but for action by Darling and her committee.

And on SeniorCare, Darling and the Republicans bucked Walker and kept SeniorCare in its current form. The Pasch news release, though, hits Darling for cutting SeniorCare.

In short: Some of the ""additional spending"" that Pasch attacks was more or less forced by events (the Medicaid piece) and some involved two issues where Pasch simultaneously criticized Darling for cutting back.

Darling’s campaign estimated that about $140 million of the funds that Joint Finance added back to the budget went for things Democrats wanted restored.

What’s the bottom line?

Trying to turn Darling’s claims of fiscal austerity against her, Pasch contended that her opponent actually had voted for a budget that increased state spending by more than $1 billion. And that she did it while cutting key programs such as education and health care.

The $1 billion figure is a real number. And Darling backed many major cutbacks. But Pasch’s statement needed some clarification and additional information -- including that some of the $1 billion went to ease the cuts in programs Pasch simultaneously accused Darling of gutting.

Guilfoyle: Obamacare is 'one big fat VA'
","The uproar over allegations of secret waiting lists at a Veterans Administration hospital in Phoenix, and delays that potentially cost veterans their lives has opened the Obama administration to criticism that it was slow to respond to the VA’s own internal reports. Some also see a connection between troubles at the VA and the president’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act. On Fox News’ The Five, four of the show’s pundits built the case that if Obama digs deeply into the VA, it will raise more questions than he would like about how the Affordable Care Act is structured. When a Fox News panelist described the VA as a ""single-payer"" system (where the financing of health care is run through the government), co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle chimed in. ""If he (Obama) shines a light on that, if we actually have some illumination there, then you're going to see this is really what the rest of you all are going to get: One big fat VA system in the form of Obamacare,"" Guilfoyle said. Using the same logic, co-host Eric Bolling later claimed that 500 people per year ""are going to die waiting"" for treatment because of Obamacare. Bolling’s claim has some fundamental problems -- we’ll address them in a bit -- but here we’re fact-checking Guilfoyle’s claim that Obamacare amounts to ""one big fat VA system."" Obamacare: One big fat VA system The VA owns hospitals. Its doctors, nurses and technicians are government employees. The people who get care at VA facilities have served in the armed forces. These facilities are not open to the general public, and Congress appropriates the funds that keep the VA running. Under the Affordable Care Act, the government works with private insurance companies and health care providers to provide health care coverage. The government subsidizes insurance premiums for some people and sets minimum standards for insurance policies. But the health care system remains in the private sector. Private sector providers get paid by insurance companies and patients. There are thousands of private providers and hundreds of insurance plans operating in hundreds of markets across the country. In the case of Medicaid, the government plays the role of the insurance company and pays private providers based on a set reimbursement schedule. Some notes about the Affordable Care Act: Employers will continue to provide health insurance to the majority of Americans through private insurance companies. The government has not seized control of hospitals or nationalized doctors. The law does not include the public option, a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers. We asked health care experts to assess the similarities and differences between the VA and the Affordable Care Act. The bottom line: it’s apples and oranges. Tom Buchmueller, who spent a year on Obama's Council of Economic Advisors and teaches at the University of Michigan, said he struggles to see any similarity at all. ""Coverage through the exchanges is private insurance,"" Buchmueller said.  Tom Getzen at Temple University said the VA is much like the institution that the veterans were once part of. ""It’s an army,"" Getzen said. ""In contrast, Obamacare is a complex legislative creation (with) the exchanges, expanded Medicaid and regulation."" Getzen said, to call Obamacare the same as the VA ""is kind of like saying your farm program is a post office."" They both have government ties, but they’re fundamentally different and are operated differently.  Scott Harrington, an adjunct scholar with the conseravtive American Enterprise Institute and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, described the changes under Obamacare as a step in the direction of a government-run health care system. ""But it’s a long way from getting there,"" Harrington said. The idea that the Affordable Care Act was a ""government takeover of health care"" was named as PolitiFact’s 2010 Lie of the Year. 500 people dying a year from Obamacare Bolling took the comparison a step further, saying the sort of delays that took place at the VA in Phoenix would repeat themselves under Obamacare, with 500 people dying a year as a result. ""President Obama wanted to insure 40 million new people under Obamacare,"" Bolling said. At the VA, he continued, the typical veteran has 13 appointments each year. Bolling applied that to 40 million new patients. ""You're talking 585 million visits, half a billion visits,"" Bolling said. ""If people are dying, how many people are going to die in Obamacare? Do the math. It will be about 500 people per year that are going to die waiting -- apples to apples."" While we won’t fact-check Bolling’s prediction, we do think it’s important to point out two problems with Bolling’s math for people who saw the segment. First, the Congressional Budget Office projects that through 2024, 26 million people will gain coverage under the Affordable Care Act. So Bolling exaggerated the base number by about 50 percent. Second, the experts we reached said veterans have very different needs than the general population. Part of the massive growth in the VA workload stemmed from disorders related to traumatic brain injury and from the lingering effects of the Vietnam War defoliant Agent Orange. Bolling doubled or even tripled the number of doctor appointments of typical Americans, experts told us. ""The average in the U.S. is between four and six,"" Getzen said. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the average number of visits fell from 4.8 a year in 2001 to 3.9 in 2010. Point being: The math Bolling used to reach his prediction is quite flawed. Our ruling Guilfoyle said Obamacare is ""one big fat VA system."" We found no health policy expert who agreed with that comparison. The VA is owned and operated by the federal government. Its staff are government employees. In contrast, Obamacare builds upon the existing private sector health industry. The law sets standards for insurance and health care providers and it subsidizes premiums. Washington does run the Medicaid insurance program but even under that program, it is paying private providers.

Katrina vanden Heuvel says Congress has 'slashed funding for veterans' benefits' in recent years
","Allegations about secret wait lists and delays for veterans seeking care at VA facilities around the country have begun to reverberate in Washington. The controversy stemmed from a variety of reports about lengthy delays that may have contributed to veterans’ deaths, compounded by allegations of efforts to cover up the delays at several VA facilities, including one in Phoenix. By May 21, 2014, the concern had become so intense that President Barack Obama held a news conference following a meeting with Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. Despite calls from some corners for Shinseki’s resignation, Obama did not say the VA secretary was stepping down. A few days earlier, the Sunday morning talk shows addressed the growing VA controversy. One of those who discussed the VA health care troubles on CBS’ Face the Nation was Katrina vanden Heuvel, the editor and publisher of the liberal magazine The Nation. ""It's an outrage,"" vanden Heuvel said. ""Those who are involved in these longer wait times must be held accountable, prosecuted to the full extent of the law. But I think we need to step back."" She continued, ""I mean, Congress has cut funding, has slashed funding, for veterans' benefits over these last years. If anyone should be offering their resignation, maybe the Congress should."" Vanden Heuvel's claim is problematic for a pair of reasons. First, she said ""veterans' benefits"" -- which include disability payments, pensions, survivor benefits and programs like the G.I. Bill and vocational rehabilitation. Those programs are considered ""mandatory spending,"" which means they’re paid by a statutory formula and are not subject to annual budgetary tinkering by Congress. What vanden Heuvel meant to refer to -- based on what she told us and the context of her comments -- was spending for the VA health system. Health system spending is considered ""discretionary"" spending and under the purview of Congress. But Congress hasn’t ""cut"" or ""slashed funding to the VA health care system. This VA budget summary sheet shows that, far from being ""slashed,"" discretionary spending on the VA has risen each year over the last decade. In fact, on Obama’s watch, the VA’s discretionary budget has risen from $47.8 billion in 2009 to $63.4 in 2014 -- a one-third increase over five years. When we reached out to vanden Heuvel, she acknowledged that the words she had used on Face the Nation made her statement inaccurate. ""In the moment, I was not precise with my words and made it sound like Congress cut year-over-year funding, which is not what happened,"" vanden Heuvel said. Instead, she continued, ""I should have said Congress systematically underfunded the VA, in part because they were slashing budgets generally."" Vanden Heuvel said her point was that the Department of Veterans Affairs had been underfunded compared to what it should have been getting, and that Congress deserves some blame because it was clear that the agency was grappling with a backlog of old cases even as new claims continued to flood in. (As we were reporting our fact-check, vanden Heuvel posted a column that lays out her argument in greater detail.) Is her point valid? We aren’t able to say what, objectively, would be a proper level of departmental funding -- that’s a matter about which reasonable people can disagree. However, Congress has consistently agreed to to spend less money on the VA than Obama had requested. Since 2010, by our calculations, Congress has agreed to fund about $2 billion a year less, on average, in discretionary spending than Obama had sought. That’s a few percentage points on the president’s proposed budget every year. On the other hand, it’s not unusual for presidents, as a negotiating tactic, to make their initial budget proposal on the high side. And Obama himself eventually signed off on the lower funding levels when he signed the final spending bills. Our ruling On Face the Nation, Vanden Heuvel said, regarding the VA health care allegations, that ""Congress has cut funding, has slashed funding, for veterans' benefits over these last years."" That’s incorrect, as vanden Heuvel acknowledged to PunditFact. VA health care and ""veterans’ benefits"" aren’t the same thing, and the pot of money that paid for VA health care has gone up every year. No reasonable definition of ""cut"" -- much less ""slash"" -- fits the data, experts told us.

Gov. Scott claims he 'cut taxes 40 times for Florida families'
","It seems like just yesterday we were analyzing Gov. Rick Scott’s claim that he had cut taxes for Floridians 24 times. But on May 13, Scott’s campaign raised the count to 40. ""Governor Scott Cut Taxes 40 Times For Florida Families,"" Scott for Florida announced on Twitter. ""40 tax cuts in 4 years. #letskeepworking."" Scott and the Legislature don’t have the budget shortfalls of years past, so tax cuts were the name of the game in Tallahassee in 2014, especially with Scott up for re-election. What were these new cuts he was touting? We hit the lawbooks to find out. Counting the ways In 2013, Scott defined a ""tax cut"" as anything that reduced government revenue by $3 million in a given year. That involved a lot of creative interpretation, such as considering a sales tax holiday a tax cut, then counting it each year. He also ruled reductions in automatic fee increases, tax credits and temporary measures as tax cuts. For 2014, this definition changed slightly, and Scott’s team also counted things that reduced government revenue by less than that. In the 2014 legislative session, freed from having to deal with budget deficits, lawmakers passed two major bills for the governor to tout. One was SB 156, which reduced auto registration fees. The other was HB 5601, a wide-ranging tax cut package that included more sales tax holidays, business tax credits and tax exemptions for child booster seats, college meal plans and even certain pet foods. After tweeting the good news, Scott’s campaign shared with us their list of 40 items, which actually totaled 41 things. Here’s a closer look at all of them: 1, 2.) Unemployment compensation taxes: Businesses saved $124.5 million when Tallahassee reduced the number of weeks and payout for unemployment compensation in 2011. A tax increase for businesses was rolled back in 2012, although not eliminated. The projected savings were $830 million for tax years 2012 through 2014. 3, 4.) Manufacturing equipment: A 2012 sales tax exemption on machinery purchases was expanded, saving $56 million. The next year the Legislature eliminated the sales tax entirely for three years, starting April 30, 2014. It was slated to cost the state $370 million and local governments $83 million through 2017. 5.) Property taxes: Scott and legislators forced state water management districts (except northwest Florida) to reduce their property tax collections by 30 percent in 2011. The $210 million cut led to modest savings for property owners. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.) Sales tax holiday: Scott counted the mostly annual tax-free shopping holiday four different times prior to 2013, at a cost of about $30 million to the state. It applied to shoes and clothing (up to $75 per item) and school supply purchases (up to $15). The state has offered the holiday every year since 1998 except in 2002, 2003, 2008 and 2009. The 2013 tax holiday (Aug. 2-4) counted twice, according to Scott, because it also exempted sales taxes on electronic equipment, such as E-readers, laptops and tablets, up to $750. For 2014, there will be three sales tax holidays: The first is a nine-day sales tax holiday for hurricane preparation supplies. Starting May 31, Floridians can purchase batteries, flashlights, tarps, and even generators worth $750 or less, without having to pay the state's 6 percent sales tax. That should reduce state revenues by about $2.9 million. Another sales tax holiday is a three-day back-to-school shopping period from Aug. 1-3, during which shoppers would not have to pay sales taxes on any clothes worth $100 or less, school supplies worth $15 or less, or on the first $750 of the cost of a personal computer. It accounts for $30 million or so. The third sales tax holiday will be held Sept. 19-21 on the purchase of energy- and water-efficient appliances costing $1,500 or less. That will reduce state revenues by about $1.7 million. 13, 14.) Corporate Income Tax exemptions: Scott asked lawmakers to expand the exemption for corporate income taxes from $5,000 to $25,000 in 2011, and then all the way up to $50,000 in 2012. Both cost the state about $60 million. 15.) Tax credit scholarships: This measure expanded a program that gives businesses a tax credit if they purchase tuition vouchers for low-income families to go to private schools, costing the state $25 million. 16, 17, 18.) Energy breaks: A 2013 law implemented part of a 2008 constitutional amendment that says a property appraiser may not base an increase in a property’s just value on the installation of a ""renewable energy source device,"" including windmills, solar panels and roof pools. The law, effective this year, may lead to local revenue losses of $12.6 million by 2017. Two other credits are in a 2012 bill, HB 7117, aimed at inspiring more renewable energy production in our natural gas-dependent state. Credits aimed at helping agribusiness and renewable energy production facilities are set to expire in 2016. Scott allowed the bill to become law without his signature. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.) Various business tax incentives: Since 2011, Scott and the Legislature have expanded tax credits available to businesses under a federal/state ""new markets"" program, allowing businesses to take it against their corporate income tax bill or insurance premium tax bill. It costs the budget $12.9 million per year. They’ve allowed companies that spent at least $250 million on capital costs from 2011-13 to write-down a portion of their Florida business taxes for a $7.5 million revenue loss. They temporarily waived a requirement that a new facility creating at least 100 jobs be in certain technology fields in order to qualify for the Capital Investment Tax Credit, though only if they are located in certain Panhandle counties. The exemption, which costs the state $4.4 million per year, lasts through June 30, 2014. They also created an annual corporate income tax credit for certain research and development expenses of up to $9 million a year. HB 5601 this year gave businesses a small decrease on the tax rate on electricity, saving $3 million, and allowed a sales tax refund on bad credit card debt, for about $6.7 million. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33.) Targeted breaks: Lawmakers eliminated sales taxes on repairs to planes between 2,000 and 15,000 pounds, worth $12.3 million. The same bill tweaked requirements for a tax credit for businesses in an urban high-crime area, costing the state $3.5 million per year. The Legislature blocked a July 2013 automatic inflation adjustment factored in registration for hunting and fishing license fees every five years, costing the state $4.4 million for 2012-13. A wide-ranging 2012 law eliminated the annual adjustment and surcharge for severing phosphate for an annual cost of $12.6 million. A person licensed as a real estate salesperson or broker associate does not have to apply for an exemption from a local business tax when he or she is an employee of someone else under a 2012 law. That resulted in a $3.8 million hit to local government per year. A portion of the 2014 tax cut package clarified how prepaid calling plans were taxed, costing $7.2 million in revenue. It also contained provisions to cut taxes for premiums on bail bonds ($700,000) and title insurance ($5.4 million). The bill also extended and increased financial incentives for businesses to donate to community development and housing projects for low-income residents by providing a tax credit or sales tax refund. These changes to the Community Contribution Tax Credits program cost $14.7 million. 34.) Communications dealers: HB 809 in 2012 spared communications dealers, in certain situations, from being liable for penalties if they assign a customer to the wrong local tax jurisdiction. The change will result in annual savings of about $4.7 million for the communications industry. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.) Sales tax exemptions: The tax cut package from 2014’s HB 5601 included several exemptions for more than just businesses. There was a temporary $3.3 million cut for the purchase of cement mixing drums for cement trucks, but the list also includes child car seats and youth bike helmets (at a combined cost to the state of about $2.5 million), prescribed diet pet food (another $2.5 million or so) and prepaid college meal plans (in the neighborhood of $12 million). These exemptions are in effect until 2017. 41.) Car registration fees: With no budget shortfall to deal with, the Legislature quickly passed SB 156, which rolled back the 2009 annual auto tag fee increase. Those fees had gone up to deal with a budget shortfall. It’s an especially big feather in Scott’s cap, who has been using the past increase as an attack against presumptive gubernatorial opponent Charlie Crist. The fee cut will save motorists about $25 a year per vehicle registration, with about $395 million in savings annually. Scott signed the bill into law April 2, but it won’t take effect until September, reducing revenue by $309 million for 2015. Tax cut tally If you’re still with us at this point, you must really want to know if Scott’s list counts as 40 tax cuts. The bottom line is, it depends on how you look at it. Experts PolitiFact Florida spoke with -- both after this claim was made and last year when Scott was trumpeting 25 cuts -- said the list contained several kinds of tax alterations that may or may not apply. The sales tax holidays, like the sales tax exemptions, are based on consuming the goods covered by the policies. The exemptions are temporary, and the holidays, which have been offered off and on since 1998, can be suspended from year to year. Counting tax credits is dubious, because that means you have to spend in one place to save in another. Preventing appraisers from raising property taxes for making an energy efficient improvement, for example, only benefits people who have already made capital improvements. Similar is the elimination of scheduled increases in hunting and fishing licenses. The fee is still being paid, just not at a higher rate than it was. Cuts in unemployment compensation may save businesses money, but they cost out-of-work Floridians money they would normally have. In fact, the bulk of the list is very friendly to businesses, but not your average taxpayer. These changes also don’t take into account whether local governments have to raise taxes to offset losses to their revenue. Our ruling Scott for Florida tweeted, ""Governor Scott Cut Taxes 40 Times For Florida Families,"" highlighting a list that actually contained 41 items. These tax cuts range from credits to exemptions to changing rates and penalties. The list focuses heavily on businesses, and like his original 24 cuts, is full of caveats. Some are counted more than once, some are only changes to scheduled increases. This year’s legislative session added a few more measures aimed at consumers, but businesses still benefit from much of it. Scott’s tax claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/may/21/rick-scott/gov-scott-claims-he-cut-taxes-40-times-florida-fam/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Bobby Jindal']","
Was Hillary Clinton against the individual mandate during the 1990s?
","Louisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal still thinks the Affordable Care Act is unworkable and he found an unlikely ally to help him criticize the law: Hillary Clinton. Before you stop the presses or get Wolf Blitzer ready in the Situation Room, there’s an important twist: Jindal was quoting Clinton from 1993. In an op-ed for Politico, Jindal rehashed his opposition to the individual mandate that requires most Americans to purchase health insurance, a key tenant of President Barack Obama’s health care law. And he noted that Clinton was once against it, too. ""It is a well-known fact that Clinton came to strenuously support an individual health insurance mandate in her 2008 primary campaign against Barack Obama,"" Jindal wrote. ""Less well-remembered, however, is that Clinton considered an employer mandate — not an individual mandate — the best way to achieve ‘universal coverage’ in her health care task force’s ill-fated 1993 proposal, put forth while she was first lady."" Twenty years have passed since the Clintons’ unsuccessful attempt at health care reform, but hey, we live in the days when hologram Michael Jackson performs on stage. So maybe what’s old is new again, and a trip to the ’90s is just what we need. The Clintons go to Washington In 1993, Hillary Clinton led a task force created by her husband, President Bill Clinton, with the goal of reforming the health industry and providing care for most of the population. On Sept. 22, 1993, President Clinton gave a speech where he laid out his proposal based off the task force’s findings. Universal coverage, he said, could be achieved by requiring all employers to provide insurance to workers. First Lady Clinton then testified on the Hill for several days to explain and defend the plan before a handful of congressional committees. Clinton said that the administration settled on an employer mandate, rather than instituting a broad-based tax similar to Medicare, or an individual mandate, which a handful of Republicans had offered as a means of achieving universal coverage. We listened to several hours of Clinton’s testimony and read many news accounts from 1993. We can say with confidence that Jindal is right: Clinton opposed delivering universal coverage entirely through an individual mandate and supported an employer mandate instead. But Jindal also picks out a couple of Clinton’s concerns and tries to tie them to current events, as though her comments in 1993 foreshadowed Obamacare’s impact on the health care industry. Perhaps Clinton’s misgivings are relevant to today’s debate, but not how Jindal portrayed them. For example, as Jindal notes, Clinton testified she thought employers may see the individual mandate as an opportunity to forgo providing their employees insurance and push them instead to the new individual market. Jindal tries to link this comment to the millions of individuals who had their policies canceled last year due to minimum requirements in Obamacare (which, he notes, contributed to PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year). Clinton’s concerns, though, have nothing to do with what happened to those people. The millions who had their policies canceled or changed last year bought plans from an independent provider, not through their employer. Clinton also thought employers might feel pressure under an individual mandate to keep wages low so employees would qualify for government-paid subsidies to purchase insurance on the private market. Jindal wrote, ""That sounds a lot like what the Congressional Budget Office concluded in February: that Obamacare will reduce the labor force by the equivalent of 2.3 million workers, because employers will not raise wages and individuals will choose not to work in order to retain access to government insurance subsidies."" That’s not what exactly what the CBO said, as we’ve noted on multiple occasions. People aren’t leaving jobs as part of a ploy to make themselves eligible for subsidies. Rather, the CBO said that the availability of affordable insurance would make it possible for individuals to voluntarily cut back hours or quit jobs they stayed in only for the health insurance (like someone with a pre-existing condition who previously could not get coverage on the private market and was working just for the insurance). It’s worth noting, too, those weren’t Clinton’s only concerns. She also said that the existing private insurance system was heavily reliant on employer-provided coverage and an employer mandate would be the ""least disruptive"" and most familiar to people. Over the last two decades, though, fewer individuals are receiving health care benefits from their employer. It’s still a plurality of Americans, but it has dropped steadily. In 1997, nearly 65 percent of individuals bought their insurance through their employer; in 2010 it was 56.5 percent, the U.S. Census said, and continues to decline. Kaiser Family Foundation, the non-partisan health experts, estimates it’s down to 48 percent of the population. Clinton also worried that government couldn’t create a system to pull off the individual mandate. She had ""great concerns about how the administrative structure to track the individual contribution, to collect it and to then connect it with health insurance would be set up."" Such a system, she said, would be ""extremely complicated and bureaucratic."" The technology the Obama administration utilized (eventually) to create a new market for buying and selling private health insurance is inconceivable to anything Clinton could have imagined back when the World Wide Web was an infant. That may have assuaged some of her concerns about the bureaucratic and logistical hurdles. Though, as Obama can attest, even with the technology, it hasn’t been easy. Finally, we noticed Clinton wasn’t all that down on the individual mandate, an idea promoted by moderate Republicans like Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. She said it was ""in the same ballpark"" as her plan because it was a means to universal coverage. It just wasn’t her prefered pathway. She was more critical of alternatives offered by conservative Democrats that did not include any mandates at all. Our ruling Jindal said that in supporting an employer health insurance mandate in 1993, Clinton opposed an individual mandate. We think readers would be wise to review the red flags we raised surrounding Jindal’s characterization of Clinton’s comments and how they apply to the current state of affairs. But when it comes to reciting history, Jindal is largely accurate. Clinton had serious misgivings about an individual mandate to buy health insurance, and strongly preferred an employer-based model. On that point, we give Jindal a Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2014/may/21/bobby-jindal/was-hillary-clinton-against-individual-mandate-dur/

Tammy Baldwin says minimum wage workers are 35 years on average
","U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat in her first term, is a vocal supporter of raising the national minimum wage to $10.10 over a three- year period and then indexing it to inflation. The issue was on her mind May 8, 2014 during an appearance on the Devil’s Advocates radio show (92.1 FM in Madison). Baldwin was discussing the importance of a college education for earning better wages and gaining upward mobility. ""I just had to smile during some of these debates we had on the minimum wage and I’m sure we’ll have again,"" Baldwin said. ""A lot of people pointed to and brushed it aside and said, ‘These are teenagers.’ "" She added:  ""First of all, they’re not. The average person who gets the minimum wage in America is 35 years old. That said, even if it involves a lot of people who are young, when we look at the cost of college, don’t we want them to be able to join their parents in helping save some money for that opportunity?"" Let’s examine whether Baldwin’s correct that ""the average person who gets the minimum wage in America is 35 years old."" Her press office pointed us to a December 2013 briefing paper by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that has studied the $10.10 proposal. ""The workers who would receive a raise do not fit the stereotypes of low-wage workers: Among affected workers, the average age is 35 years old, nearly 88 percent are at least 20 years old, and more than a third (34.5 percent) are at least 40 years old,"" the  institute’s paper concluded. President Barack Obama, who is pushing for $10.10, used the same lines -- and evidence -- less than two weeks before Baldwin. In his April 26, 2014 weekly radio address, Obama said: ""Right now, there’s a bill that would boost America’s minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. That would lift wages for nearly 28 million Americans across the country. 28 million. And we’re not just talking about young people on their first job. The average minimum wage worker is 35 years old. They work hard, often in physically demanding jobs."" PolitiFact National rated Obama’s comment about the average age Mostly False. Both Baldwin and Obama were trying to counter wage-hike critics who have said that it’s primarily teenagers who work in minimum-wage positions. In April, we rated Mostly False a claim by the Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce that ""typical minimum wage earners in America are teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families."" We found that by one definition of minimum-wage workers, teenagers make up the largest sub-group compared with other age groupings. But teenagers are less than a third of all minimum wage workers, and hard data is scarce on how many live in middle-class families. Baldwin, too, tripped up here. She framed her claim around people currently making the minimum wage. But the EPI study that put the average age at 35 looked at the larger universe of all workers who would receive a raise from the boost to $10.10. Many are making more than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, but less than $10.10. In fact, the EPI research also factored in people currently earning up to $11.10, on the theory that those workers would probably also be given raises if the minimum were set at $10.10. So what is the average age of the pool of workers currently at the minimum wage, the group Baldwin mentioned? David Cooper, who authored the EPI study, put the figure at 30 among those right at the federal minimum, based on his research. It’s not that simple, though, because more than half the U.S. workforce toils in states that have raised the minimum wage above the current federally mandated $7.25, according to Cooper. To address that, Cooper studied the demographics of workers ""at or near their effective state minimum wage,"" defining that as within 3 percent of the minimum-wage level, Cooper told PolitiFact National in April 2014. The average age is 31 in that group, Cooper found. Our rating Baldwin’s remarks contained an element of truth about the demographics of minimum-wage workers. But the average age of 35 holds for those who would benefit from a change to $10.10, not the group Baldwin spoke of -- current minimum-wage workers. We rate her claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/may/21/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-says-minimum-wage-workers-are-35-yea/

Garrett: On VA troubles, Obama has been silent for three weeks
","As pressure builds for a clear accounting at Veterans Affairs over allegations of hidden wait lists and delays that cost veterans their lives, the Obama administration’s response has been roundly criticized. In an interview with CBS News, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough said President Barack Obama is ""madder than hell"" about the possibility that care was denied to people who needed treatment. But CBS chief White House correspondent Major Garrett pushed McDonough on what Obama is doing about it. ""It's been nearly three weeks since the president has commented on this publicly,"" Garrett said.""Where's the president been? McDonough never really provided a clear answer to Garrett, so we wanted to see exactly what the president has said since the story broke. The White House press office pointed us to Obama’s answer during a press conference in Manila, Philippines, on April 28. A reporter asked if Obama would pledge to fix things. ""The moment we heard about the allegations around these 40 individuals who had died in Phoenix, I immediately ordered the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Gen. (Eric) Shinseki, to investigate,"" Obama said. ""We also have an IG (inspector general) investigation taking place. And so we take the allegations very seriously."" Since that day -- just about three weeks ago -- the president has made no public statement. His press secretary Jay Carney invoked the president’s name when he announced the resignation of the under secretary for health at Veterans Affairs on May 16, but Obama himself has not spoken since. News of problems at the VA While troubles at VA hospitals have been covered for months -- CNN reported in January that veterans were dying due to health care delays -- a House hearing on April 9 drew broader attention. Chair of the Veterans Affairs Committee Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., revealed that between the VA’s own investigation and that of the committee’s staff, delays may have caused the deaths of about 40 veterans who sought care at the VA hospital in Phoenix. Soon after, a retired clinic director from that hospital came forward and described how administrators used hand-written lists to conceal the long wait-times that over 1,000 veterans endured. More reports came in from the VA Office of the Medical Inspector that managers at a facility in Fort Collins, Colo., also had falsified wait-time records. Obama assigned deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors to oversee the VA review. Shinseki, meanwhile, faced a tough session in front of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee on May 15. At the hearing, Shinseki said three top executives in Phoenix had been put on administrative leave and that a full investigation and audit was underway. On Monday, May 19, the White House said the public would hear from the president soon.

Gun advocate Larry Pratt says 'smart guns' fail 20 percent of the time
","The debate over ""smart guns"" doesn’t always turn up accurate talking points. Exhibit A: Sarah Palin telling the National Rifle Association crowd about a (nonexistent) federal plan to make gun owners wear ""special bracelets that would identify you as a gun owner."" Exhibit B: MSNBC host Chris Hayes’ recent on-air shouting match with Larry Pratt, executive director of the lobbying group Gun Owners of America. Smart guns -- also known as ""child-proof guns"" and ""personalized guns"" -- are designed to work solely for authorized users through features like fingerprint recognition or electronic sensors. The hope is they will reduce deaths by suicide, accidental shootings or someone stealing a law enforcement officer’s weapon. They are not sold in the United States, though two dealers tried before backing down amid intense pressure from activists. Hayes supports the technology, but Pratt and other gun-rights advocates are skeptical. Pratt questions the guns’ reliability, saying smart guns are ""only 80 percent effective."" When Hayes pressed Pratt for the source of his statistic, Pratt cited the New Jersey Institute of Technology. ""Twenty percent of the time it won’t work,"" Pratt said. ""And you’re asking people to put their lives in the hands of a product like that?"" Later, Pratt used the figure again. ""Is it okay to put on the market a car that 20 percent of the time explodes on you and causes you harm or death?"" Since Pratt tripled down on his statistic, PunditFact wanted to check it out. Tracing the source of the claim Pratt pointed to a 2003 column in Popular Mechanics magazine headlined ""‘Smart’ Guns: Dumb Idea!"" The column was inspired by a 2002 New Jersey law that requires all guns sold in the state to have ""smart"" technology within three years of the attorney general verifying the first smart gun was sold in the United States. Fear among gun rights activists that more government mandates may come when this happens drive their opposition to smart guns. In his column 11 years ago, writer Cliff Gromer said law enforcement officers are exempt from the law, which proves the technology isn’t solid enough for the mainstream gun market. ""According to the New Jersey Institute of Technology, which used government grants to study personalized handgun technology, fingerprint recognition systems work only 80 percent of the time,"" Gromer wrote. ""But the New Jersey law goes into effect regardless of whether the guns are 100 percent -- or 80 percent -- reliable."" Article is not the smoking gun You may have read over it, but the 80 percent figure Gromer cited talks about fingerprint recognition systems. Not whether a smart gun will work. That’s important because while some smart guns use fingerprint recognition systems (which work like the new unlocking method for iPhones), not all do. The German-made Armatix iP1 .22 caliber pistol was expected to be the first smart gun sold in the United States this year until a California gun store owner scrapped plans to sell it after facing aggressive backlash. It happened again with a Maryland dealer. The Armatix does not have a fingerprint recognition system. Instead, the gun works with a black stopwatch and PIN code that emits radio signals to the gun to make it active. The signal is akin to what’s emitted from those bulky tags on mall merchandise that aren’t triggered until taken out of the store. Other models work with similar chips implanted in everyday accessories, such as bracelets, pins and rings, and some are implanted in the body. If the badge is too far away from the microchip in the gun, it will stop working. But that means the technology works, not that it failed. And, more critically, the Armatix radio signal has nothing to do with the study Pratt cited, which focused on fingerprint recognition systems, New Jersey Institute of Technology researchers told us. Other smart guns also avoid fingerprint technology. Michael Recce, an associate professor in the information systems department at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, invented ""dynamic grip recognition"" and applied it to a gun, so that it fires only after it recognizes the user’s grip thanks to sensors on the side of the gun that detect pressure and the contours of the user's hand. The gun starts to detect if the user is authorized as someone starts pulling the gun, he said. Recce said the owner detection rate for his dynamic grip ""is within the mechanical failure rate,"" i.e. the rate at which a standard gun fails. However, two or three people out of 100 adults could also fire the gun in trials because their hand is similar to the owner’s -- a tradeoff with the technology so it is sure to fire for the rightful owner, he said. Other types of smart guns in varying stages of development are outlined in a year-old National Institute of Justice report commissioned as part of President Barack Obama’s gun reforms after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings. This research is dated In this case, the New Jersey Institute of Technology research is being misapplied, and it’s old. Researchers told us their work on fingerprint scanners should not be applied to newer guns. Their research, which was not published, was done in the early 2000s on four types of guns using fingerprint readers. None of those guns were as reliable as mechanical firearms, they found, though the guns were a ""fragile technology"" then, said Donald Sebastian, New Jersey Institute of Technology senior vice president for research and development. ""Fingerprint readers may have progressed in the past 10 years,"" Recce said. ""At that time even the readers on laptops would often require you to swipe your finger more than once before they worked. Our opinion was that swiping your finger over the reader multiple times would be a challenge when using a gun."" Skeptics of these guns point to many concerns about the reliability of the weapons in a high-pressure situation, like who has time to enter a PIN code, and what if the sensors in the gun die? Michael Bazinet, a National Shooting Sports Foundation spokesman, said the ""strongest statement on their reliability"" will be when law enforcement officers use them en masse. But other potential weaknesses don’t change the fact that what Pratt cited is old news. ""To make a universal blanket statement based on a 15-year-old analysis of fingerprint detectors just doesn’t pass muster,"" Sebastian said. ""It’s like talking about the reliability of a Model T and comparing it to a race car. Apples and oranges."" If not 80 percent reliable, then what? Finding a reliability rate for smart guns is an ""almost unanswerable question,"" said Stephen Teret, a pro-smart gun Johns Hopkins professor and director of the university’s Center for Law and the Public’s Health. ""Because there’s a wide range of quality in existing guns, some are better, some are worse. So when you are trying to compute a rate of reliability, are you using one gun or various categories?"" Robert Spitzer, a SUNY Cortland political science professor and author of The Politics of Gun Control (whom Hayes brought in after Pratt to talk about the issue), said in order for the Armatix iP1 gun to be sold in California, it had to pass a reliability test. ""The standard was a 99 percent successful fire rate, which it met (fire 600 times with 6 or fewer failed discharges),"" Spitzer said. Others stressed that all guns are prone to failure at some point. The mechanical failure rate is often given as 1 in 1,000, and a military weapon’s failure rate is closer to 1 in 10,000, Sebastian said. ""Misfire is embedded in our language,"" he said. Our ruling Pratt said ""20 percent of the time (smart guns) won't work,"" which he got from a 2003 magazine story referencing unpublished research from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. The scientists who conducted that research say Pratt’s citation is misapplied. Researchers only looked at smart guns that rely on fingerprint sensors, yet Pratt applied the statistic to all smart guns, including the Armatix pistol that works with a black stopwatch, PIN code and small electronic chips. Even more, their research is more than a decade old, and they say fingerprint matching technology has changed since then. Pratt’s statement is not based on solid evidence. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2014/may/20/larry-pratt/larry-pratt-smart-gun-fails-20-percent/

Lawmaker: Common Core testing company forces children to become 'as homosexual as they possibly can'
","Heads up moms and dads -- a Florida lawmaker has unearthed one more conspiracy behind Common Core. A company that has been hired by Florida to give students tests will be recruiting every one of those students to become gay.   Think Progress, a liberal blog, dug up a video of state Rep. Charles Van Zant, R-Keystone Heights, speaking about the topic at the ""Operation Education"" conference -- a gathering of conservative religious groups who met about the theme of ""How education reforms are attacking America’s Foundation."" The Orlando conference was in March, but Think Progress posted a video clip of Zant on May 19, and the video then spread to other blogs. We listened to the full speech. Here is the portion that drew attention: ""Our new secretary of education in Florida recently appointed AIR to receive the $220 million contract for end-of-course exam testing and to prepare those tests. Please -- go on their website. Click the link to what they are doing with youth, and you will see what their agenda really is. They are promoting as hard as they can any youth that is interested in the LGBT agenda and even name it 2-S, which they define as having two spirits. The Bible says a lot about being double-minded.  ""These people that will now receive $220 million from the state of Florida, unless this is stopped, will promote double mindedness in state education, and attract every one of your children to become as homosexual as they possibly can. I'm sorry to report that to you. ... I really hate to bring you that news, but you need to know."" Van Zant encouraged listeners to research AIR, so we took him up on his suggestion and decided to check if AIR plans to ""attract every one of your children to become as homosexual as they possibly can."" We contacted Van Zant’s office and asked him to provide evidence to support his claim and did not get a response. We should note that our previous fact-checking shows people can’t be recruited to a particular sexual orientation. In 2011, GOP presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty said scientists are ""in dispute"" about whether being gay is a choice, and we rated that claim False. (Editor’s note: We added this point after our initial publication to address reader concerns.) Here, we’ll explore Van Zant’s specific claim that a testing company was making the attempt. Common Core tests and AIR In March, the state Department of Education announced that it would give a $220 million, 6-year contract to American Institutes for Research to develop and administer new accountability tests to replace Florida’s old testing system, the FCAT. The Washington-based nonprofit will develop tests aligned to the Florida Standards, the new education benchmarks based on the controversial Common Core State Standards. The new tests are expected to be ready for the 2014-15 school year. AIR has contracts to develop tests for about 10 states including Florida. When the state chose AIR, Common Core foes took aim at the testing company. The Florida Stop Common Core Coalition accused AIR of promoting a lesbian gay bisexual transgender ""lifestyle"", better known as LGBT, calling the choice of AIR ""completely unacceptable"": ""Besides implementing the same deceptive plan discussed at the governor's summit in August, the state has chosen a company that has a significant history of promoting identification of the GLBT lifestyle for children as young as seven years old,"" Florida Eagle Forum lobbyist Randy Osborne said in a Florida Stop Common Core Coalition letter to supporters. (Similar claims have been made by Common Core opponents in Utah and Tennessee.) We rated the coalition’s claim Half True in March. As we explained in that fact-check, one part of AIR’s business is creating materials for schools on LGBT Youth issues, in which it studies the youngsters’ experiences and offers recommendations for how to help the students. AIR only provides those materials to entities that request them -- currently that includes federal government contracts. AIR has no such contracts with the state Department of Education or any Florida districts to provide LGBT materials. (AIR is in discussions with a couple of districts in other states.) ""No entity in Florida has asked us to do LGBT work,"" AIR spokesman Larry McQuillan said. AIR describes its practice in this way: ""AIR’s Health and Social Development program develops knowledge and understanding about LGBT youth that takes account of their experiences and needs. AIR also enhances opportunities for the healthy development, well-being, and safety of LGBT children, youth, and their families by providing workforce training and technical assistance to service providers across systems addressing behavioral health, child welfare, education, juvenile justice, and homelessness."" AIR also does similar work in the areas of bullying and substance abuse in addition to its efforts in education, health and workforce matters. ""We are not an advocacy group,"" McQuillan told PolitiFact in March. ""AIR is a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization. We do educational assessment, research, health policy research and communication, and international development. We have supported many states by providing high-quality assessments of their specific state standards."" A few standards include sexual orientation We interviewed McQuillan about Van Zant’s comments and asked about what sort of material will be included on the tests. ""It’s the state that decides what questions they want to ask,"" he said. ""Florida is truly in control."" Joe Follick, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Education, said the tests administered by AIR will only include English language arts and math. ""Florida has always been and will continue to be committed to assessments that solely measure a student's knowledge of subject areas and critical thinking spelled out in the Florida Standards,"" Follick said in an email in response to our questions. Our ruling A firm hired to do Common Core testing in Florida will ""attract every one of your children to become as homosexual as they possibly can,"" Van Zant said. The firm hired to do testing, AIR, separately provides information to entities that request it to help them assist LGBT students. Currently, the federal government accesses AIR’s information but the organization doesn’t have such a contract with the state of Florida or any Florida districts. We found no evidence that when AIR administers tests in Florida that the testing process will involve recruiting students to become gay. Van Zant takes a somewhat limited connection between the testing company and gay and lesbian issues and then blows it up into a wild claim that lacks evidence. We rate this Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/may/20/charles-van-zant/common-core-testing-homosexual-possibly-can/

Sorting out tax breaks for David Beckham's Miami soccer stadium
","""Tax deal"" and ""stadium"" are fighting words if you put them in the same sentence in Miami-Dade County. Taxpayers were so angry over the public financing that paid for most of the Miami Marlins ballpark -- which failed to produce big crowds or revitalize the area -- that they recalled County Mayor Carlos Alvarez and Commissioner Natacha Seijas. Now opponents of David Beckham’s proposed soccer stadium at PortMiami are trying to tap into voters’ distaste for tax breaks in a TV ad that shows concerned looking couples paying bills: ""Why won’t the out of town port stadium developers tell us about the special tax deal that lets them off the hook for $2 million in taxes every year for 30 years. You think you could not pay taxes for 30 years? Now we find out it's Miami-Dade families who have to pay taxes to help give them parking garages."" The music then turns sinister as a photo of the boogeyman in Miami sports -- the Marlins’ stadium -- appears on the screen. ""Remind you of anything?"" the narrator asks. ""Miami deserves better."" The ad is paid for by the Miami Seaport Alliance, led by Royal Caribbean Cruises, which fought against the stadium site at the port close to the cruise line’s headquarters. PolitiFact Florida previously fact-checked an alliance ad that the port stadium proposal ""threatens the 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact tied to the cargo and cruise industries"" and rated it False. Here we will fact-check the statement that Beckham will be ""off the hook for $2 million in taxes every year for 30 years."" The ad ran on TV in mid-May days before Beckham announced that he would drop the port site in favor of a site downtown. The tax deal that the ad mentioned still exists regardless of the site, however. Legislature approved sales tax subsidy The site now favored by Beckham would involve filling in a boat slip downtown. The city and county both own portions of the site, making the deal somewhat complicated. The Miami Herald reported that a possible agreement could involve the stadium not paying property taxes but making an annual payment in lieu of taxes to the city and rent to the county. This site has its detractors, including environmental activists and those who oppose building along the shoreline. The ad doesn’t explain what type of ""tax deal"" Beckham is seeking. The answer: Beckham says he will privately finance construction of a stadium, but plans to apply for a state sales tax subsidy. This spring, he worked the halls of Tallahassee posing with legislators taking selfies as he lobbied for the deal. The TV ad pointed viewers to House Bill 7095, which was approved by the state Legislature by wide margins in May. Scott has said he plans to sign the bill. The bill adds soccer to the types of sports franchises that can compete for sales tax rebates for construction projects. Here’s how it works: When fans buy certain items at the stadium -- such as t-shirts or food -- they pay a sales tax. That amount is 7 percent including a 1 percent add-on for Miami-Dade. Typically a little less than 90 percent of sales tax is distributed to state general revenue which can go toward everything from fixing roads to paying teachers or prison guards. Most of the remainder is shared with counties and cities which can also use them for their general revenues. But under the bill, sports facilities, including the Miami soccer stadium, would get a rebate of 75 percent of the sales taxes from the new development. And the bill speeds up the process for Beckham’s stadium in Miami, as well as an Orlando soccer stadium and the Daytona International Speedway. The three projects could share in about $7 million in tax breaks next year, according to the Miami Herald. Beginning in 2015-16, a total of $13 million would be available to multiple sports franchises, including soccer, football and NASCAR. The amount of potential annual subsidies escalates based on the size of the investment -- construction projects of more than $200 million could get up to $3 million a year for 30 years, while projects in the $100 million to $200 million range could get $2 million a year. The stadium at the port was estimated to cost $250, including additional infrastructure costs, but the cost of the downtown site wasn’t immediately clear. The state Department of Economic Opportunity would rank the proposals from sports franchises, but the Legislature would make the final call. Teams would be forced to return the money if they generated less sales tax revenues than anticipated or left the state. We sent the ad to spokespersons for Miami Beckham United, who did not dispute the amount of the tax subsidy cited in the ad. ""These funds are considered a sales tax rebate for spending generated by stadium activity that would otherwise not occur, such as fans buying a hot dog at the game, a t-shirt at the team store or a meal at a stadium restaurant,"" said John Alschuler, strategic advisor to Miami Beckham United. We also sent the ad’s statement about the special tax break to Kurt Wenner, vice president of tax research at Florida TaxWatch, a business-backed organization that takes a critical look at state taxes and spending. ""As is often the case with these things, it’s a matter of semantics. It is not a tax break. It does not let anyone off the hook for taxes,"" Wenner told PolitiFact Florida. Sales taxes are still collected on sales at the stadium, but the owners get a subsidy of 75 percent of the additional sales tax collected due to the project. ""So, it is not a tax break, but the result is basically the same, recipients will get up to $3 million annually of taxpayer money."" Our ruling The alliance’s ad says Beckham’s soccer stadium would get a ""special tax deal that lets them off the hook for $2 million in taxes every year for 30 years."" The ad correctly cites the numbers, though it omits some caveats: Beckham could get at least $2 million every year for 30 years, in the form of a sales tax subsidy. But it’s not an automatic slam dunk, since Beckham would have to apply for it. Though Beckham’s star power certainly influenced legislators to add soccer to the list of eligible franchises, it’s not a ""special tax deal"" exclusively for Beckham’s project. The main point of this statement is largely correct: Beckham is poised to get at least $2 million a year in rebates from the sales tax. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/may/20/miami-seaport-alliance/david-beckhams-soccer-stadium-would-be/

Hillary Clinton says United States is falling behind Canada on key measurements
","The next presidential election may still be two and a half years away, but the presumptive Democratic frontrunner, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is all over the news. On May 16, 2014, in a speech at the New America Foundation, a moderate-to-liberal think tank, Clinton compared the United States and Canada on several measures of well-being. Clinton found the United States wanting. ""Canadian middle class incomes are now higher than in the United States,"" Clinton said. ""They are working fewer hours for more pay, enjoying a stronger safety net, living longer on average, and facing less income inequality."" We’ll set aside the claim about the safety net, since that’s tricky to measure statistically. But the other claims are ripe for a closer look. So we’ll take them in order. (Clinton’s camp did not respond to our inquiry.) Canadian middle-class incomes are now higher than in the United States This is the trickiest of the measurements Clinton mentioned, for a couple reasons. First, there’s no universally recognized definition of ""middle class"" in the available data. Second, there’s more than one way to measure the data. Some measurements take a nation’s economic output as a whole and divide it by the population, whereas others sample individual people or households to find out how much they make, then find the midpoint. Clinton has support from New York Times article that looked at data from the Luxembourg Income Study database, which is based on surveys going back 35 years. The study surveyed people in various countries, asked them what they earned, then used a median to determine the mid-range income level. The New York Times concluded that ""median income in Canada pulled into a tie with median United States income in 2010 and has most likely surpassed it since then,"" due to studies conducted by other groups since 2010 suggest that pay in Canada has risen faster than pay in the United States. On the other hand, if you look at gross domestic product per capita --  the total amount of economic activity divided by population -- the United States tops Canada, and not by a trivial amount. In 2012, GDP per capita in the United States was $51,689, compared to $41,559 for Canada, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. (These figures, as with all other money figures in this article, have been converted to U.S. dollars, so that they can be compared.) But this method has drawbacks. Because it represents an average across the entire economy, the final results tend to over-represent the income that flows to the wealthy. So it’s not ideal for measuring ""the middle class."" Munroe Eagles, director of Canadian studies at the State University of New York-Buffalo, and Ross Burkhart, co-director of the Canadian Studies Program at Boise State University, told PolitiFact that using the Luxembourg Income Study is at least as good a measurement for Clinton’s claim as the other figures, if not better. They are working fewer hours for more pay than Americans OECD data for the average number of hours worked annually per employed person shows that Clinton is correct. In the United States in 2012, workers spent 1,790 hours per year on the job, compared to 1,710 hours per year in Canada. One could say that Americans are working harder and producing more goods and services, but Clinton’s point was that Canadians have greater opportunities for leisure, and on that point, the statistics support her point. As for getting more pay, OECD statistics for 2012 show that the average annual wages for workers in Canada were $58,376, compared to $55,048 in the United States. This measures the average wages earned by a full-time, full-year employee. These statistics support Clinton’s claim. Canadians are living longer OECD data for life expectancy at birth shows that in 2011, Canadians could expect to live 81 years, while in 2009, the most recent year available, Americans could expect to live 78.7 years. So Clinton’s right on this one, too. There’s less income inequality in Canada The primary statistic used for gauging income inequality is the ""Gini coefficient."" Gini coefficients range from 0, or perfect equality, to 1, or perfect inequality. According to the OECD, the Gini coefficient for Canada in 2010 was .320, compared to .380 in the United States. That means Canada is modestly more equal than the United States is, which is what Clinton had claimed. Overall, the five comparisons Clinton made are reasonable and aren’t cherry-picked or subject to statistical quirks, Burkhart said. ""It's fair, in my understanding of the Canadian and U.S. economies, for Ms. Clinton to make the kinds of comparisons that Ms. Clinton has made,"" Burkhart said. Our ruling Clinton said that ""Canadian middle class incomes are now higher than in the United States. They are working fewer hours for more pay, … living longer on average, and facing less income inequality."" She’s indisputably correct on four of these five measures, and the data is more mixed on the fifth. On balance, we rate her claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/may/20/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-united-states-falling-behind-/

GOP opponent says Mark Begich took campaign money from Koch brothers
","In Alaska, no U.S. Senate candidate wants to be tied to the billionaire Koch brothers. Back-and-forth ads between incumbent Mark Begich, a Democrat, and former Attorney General Dan Sullivan, a Republican frontrunner, have both slung accusations of Koch affiliation. A pro-Begich super PAC, Put Alaska First, fired the first shot in April. It released the ad ""Lost,"" which criticized Sullivan for not doing enough to prevent the Koch-owned refinery from closing, resulting in a loss of 80 jobs. ""Dan Sullivan remains silent about the jobs being lost here,"" the ad said. ""And those same billionaires, the Koch brothers, are supporting his campaign."" The next week Sullivan released a radio ad: ""Dan Sullivan has never taken a dime from the Koch brothers,"" the narrator said. ""It’s Begich who has taken campaign cash from the Kochs."" As a Democrat, Begich wouldn’t be a typical recipient of Koch funds. So we decided to fact-check whether the attack was accurate. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org pointed out that although Sullivan hasn’t accepted money directly from the Koch brothers or their affiliates, the Koch-backed Americans For Prosperity has spent nearly $1 million on Begich attack ads. Sullivan isn't receiving those funds, but he does benefit from an attack on his opponent that can't be legally coordinated directly between the candidate and the group. As for Begich, we found that KochPAC, a Koch Industries group, gave $5,000 to Begich’s Great Land PAC back in 2010. Begich’s PAC primarily gives money to candidates, as well as state and federal Democratic parties. In 2010, the Kochs also gave money to Democratic senators like Mary Landrieu, Mark Pryor and Chuck Schumer. In 2013 and 2014, they haven’t given any money to Democratic Senate candidates, and just three Democratic House candidates. A spokeswoman for the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which runs OpenSecrets.org, said she’d be surprised to see much Koch money going to Democrats this cycle. A Koch Industries spokesman told Politico in March 2014 that KochPAC doesn’t base its donations on the candidate’s party, but rather on the company’s business and policy interests. Our ruling Sullivan said Mark Begich ""has taken campaign cash from the Kochs"" but that Sullivan ""hasn’t taken a dime."" In 2010, KochPAC donated $5,000 to a Begich-affiliated PAC. But that's a modest amount by campaign-finance standards, and Begich hasn’t received any more in the past four years. While Sullivan hasn’t received money directly from the Kochs, he and Begich’s other Republican challengers certainly benefit from the much larger TV ad buys by Koch-affiliated groups attacking the Democrat. A Koch-funded group, Americans For Prosperity, has spent nearly $1 million in Alaska benefiting Sullivan and other Republicans in the race.

Cheney: At ""mere request of Putin,"" Obama ditched Eastern Europe missile defense plan
","As the unstable situation in Ukraine continues, former Vice President Dick Cheney was asked Sunday what he thought of President Barack Obama’s handling of Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. Cheney said Putin has taken advantage of what he sees as weakness in Obama, and that Obama had sent the wrong signals as early as 2009. ""At the mere request from Putin, President Obama withdrew the plans for a missile defense program based in Poland and the Czech Republic,"" Cheney said on Fox News Sunday. Here, we’re fact-checking whether Obama withdrew plans for a missile defense program at Putin’s request. The Bush plan In 2006, on advice from Defense Secretary Robert Gates, President George W. Bush pushed for an initiative to install 10 interceptor missiles on the ground in Poland and an advanced radar system in the Czech Republic, to counter the potential threat of long-range missiles from Iran. Russia did not like the idea one bit. Russian defense minister Sergei Ivanov told the Russian news organization Ria Novosti that Russia was opposed and that the plans did not make ""political sense, much less military sense."" During the 2008 election, candidate Obama said he supported the installations in Poland and the Czech Republic but also said he was open to rethinking them. When Obama took office in 2009, he spoke of making U.S. relations with Russia less confrontational. The symbol of this was a photo-op of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presenting her Russian counterpart with a  ""reset"" button. Three years after Bush announced his missile defense proposal, Obama changed course. On Sept. 17, 2009, Obama announced that the United States would pursue a new missile defense policy focused on knocking out short- and medium-range Iranian missiles. The new plan relied on missiles based on American warships and eventually sites closer to Iran. The response at home and overseas Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, released statements suggesting that Obama was being soft and letting down American allies. Pundits like John Bolton, whom Bush had appointed as ambassador to the United Nations, said Russia and Iran came away as ""big winners"" in a ""bad day for American national security."" Meanwhile, Israel and most NATO countries in Western Europe approved of the move, news stories show, because they thought the missile system provoked Russia. Polish and Czech leaders expressed disappointment. Obama left it to Defense Secretary Robert Gates to explain the shift. In a New York Times op-ed, and later in his 2014 book Duty, Gates said that Defense Department officials realized the Iranian government was putting more stock into building short- and medium-range missiles over long-range ones. The agency wanted to uproot the old plan to better counteract that threat, and the new tactic Gates and the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to Obama was cheaper and took less time to implement. Lance Janda, chairman of the Department of History and Government at Cameron University, added that the full U.S. strategy included deploying potentially hundreds of interceptor missiles in Eastern Europe starting in 2018. Lost in the GOP fury, Gates wrote, was that the Russians found Obama’s new approach to be even more worrisome than the Bush-era plan.  They worried that those missiles could easily be configured to thwart them as well as Iran. Our ruling Cheney said Obama dropped a missile defense plan based in Poland and the Czech Republic on the ""mere request"" of Putin. While Putin strenuously objected to the plan, a Pentagon reassessment of the nature of Iran’s capabilities was the actual reason for the change. The Pentagon saw a greater danger from Iranian short-and-medium-range missiles than the long range missiles that were targeted in the original plan. NATO allies and Israel also favored the new approach, which included steps to install a missile defense system in Poland in 2018. So, Obama did forgo the Bush-era plan, but he didn’t do it at the ""mere request"" of Putin.

Cheney: Bush admin did more to help Georgia than Obama has done for Ukraine
","As events have proved, Russian President Vladimir Putin exerts far more influence than the West over the fate of Ukraine. On Fox News Sunday, former Vice President Dick Cheney faulted President Barack Obama for giving Putin the sense that he could take advantage of a weak U.S. policy. When he was reminded that Russia had done exactly as it pleased on Georgian territory under the George W. Bush administration, Cheney said that was different. ""What we did at the time was, I think, a more robust response,"" Cheney said. ""We flew in a brigade of Georgian soldiers that had been involved supporting our efforts in Iraq, flew them back into Georgia. We tried to provide some support there, as well as sent U.S. ships into the Black Sea and provided various kinds of supplies."" Other Republicans have made the same point. We are not able to compare the robustness of the Bush and Obama responses to Russia but we can add some details about the Georgian troops and the U.S. supplies. A quick recap In 2008, armed conflict erupted in Georgia over two separatist regions within Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. After several years of restiveness by Russian-backed rebels in South Ossetia, the Georgian government made a military push that attempted to retake control of the region in August 2008. Russia responded militarily, successfully pushing back Georgian troops from both South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Clashes continued for a week, including in portions of Georgia beyond the two breakaway regions, until France helped broker a peace deal. Russia then recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as sovereign nations, though most other countries have not taken that step. The Georgian brigade airlift On Aug. 11, 2008, Agence France-Presse reported that the U.S. military had ""nearly completed"" the airlift of 2,000 Georgian troops from Iraq to Georgia. At the time, the United States took pains to portray its actions as being limited rather than aggressive. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told reporters that the United States was ""fulfilling our agreement with the Georgian government that, in an emergency, we will assist them in redeploying their troops. We are honoring that commitment."" Whitman told reporters at the time that the 130 U.S. troops and military contractors who were already in the country to train Georgian troops had been brought together at an undisclosed location away from the hostilities. And Whitman made clear to reporters that -- contrary to allegations by Putin -- the United States was not flying the Iraq-based Georgian troops to the war zone. The U.S. war ships The United States -- and its military alliance, NATO -- did indeed have ships in the Black Sea near Georgia in August 2008, but the story behind their presence is more nuanced than an unmistakable show of force against Russian aggression. The administration sent the guided missile destroyer McFaul to the Georgian port of Batumi, but it was loaded with humanitarian aid. ""At the time, these gestures were not viewed as particularly strong,"" said Lincoln Mitchell, who was chief of party for the National Democratic Institute in Georgia from 2002 to 2004 and is now affiliated with the Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili ""complained throughout the war that he was not getting support,"" Mitchell told PunditFact in March. David L. Phillips is director of Columbia University’s program on peace-building and rights. ""There was never any chance of the Bush administration going to war in Georgia, and everybody knew that,"" Phillips said. ""It was for show. It would be misleading to suggest that our response was so robust that it deterred further aggression."" Our ruling Cheney said the Bush administration flew Georgian troops back to Georgia and used American war ships to provide supplies during that country’s conflict with Russia. While both actions took place, the troops were not sent into combat against Russian forces and the supplies were humanitarian. Neither effort tipped the military balance in Georgia’s favor.

In Idaho debate that went viral, challenger misfires on Obamacare marketplace claim
","A recent gubernatorial debate in Boise was so -- um -- unusual that it reverberated far beyond Idaho. The debate featured Idaho Gov. Butch Otter, who’s seeking his third term, and three Republicans seeking to defeat him in a primary. One, Russ Fulcher, is a state senator who’s running against Otter from the right. The other two were more colorful -- Harley Brown, a biker sporting leather gear and fingerless gloves, and Walt Bayes, a homeschooling activist with a prodigious beard and ""77 descendants."" The debate produced enough colorful moments that it quickly went viral -- for instance, when Brown said, ""I'm about as politically correct as your proverbial turd in a punch bowl,"" or when Bayes closed with a warning about nuclear contamination. As intriguing as those claims are, we’re going to focus instead on a wonkier assertion made by Fulcher. Referring to Otter’s decision to create a state-based marketplace under President Barack Obama’s health care law, Fulcher said Otter didn’t oppose Obamacare strongly enough, adding, ""Idaho was the only Republican-led state in the nation that chose to partner with President Obama."" We decided to see if he was correct. (Fulcher’s campaign did not reply to an inquiry for this fact-check.) First, some background. Under the Affordable Care Act, states had three choices for creating an online marketplace that residents could use to browse health insurance plans and purchase the one that would best fit their needs and budget. States were allowed to create their own online marketplace; they could partner with the federal government to create a hybrid state-federal site; or they could do nothing, in which case residents would instead use the federal healthcare.gov site by default. Idaho took the first option of starting its own marketplace. The Affordable Care Act has been a target of Republican criticism generally, nowhere more than in strongly conservative states like Idaho. But while Otter was -- and is -- critical of the law overall, he said he decided to push for a state-run online marketplace in order to make sure Idaho would be able to have some control of how the law is implemented. In pushing for the creation of a state-run marketplace, Otter faced resistance within the GOP-dominated state House and Senate. But he ultimately cobbled together a coalition of Democrats and some Republicans to pass legislation that authorized a state-based marketplace. Otter signed the law on March 28, 2013. So despite opposition by many GOP legislators, Idaho was certainly a ""Republican-led state"" that ""chose to partner"" with the Obama administration on creating a health insurance marketplace. But was Idaho the only state with a Republican governor who was willing to start a marketplace? The short answer is no. There were four others: • Michigan. Republican Gov. Rick Snyder supported the creation of a full state-based marketplace, but he was stymied by a Republican-controlled legislature that delayed the effort long enough that the federal deadlines lapsed, making that option impossible. Instead, Snyder pursued a state-federal marketplace, while also leaving the door open to an entirely state-based site if the legislature eventually changed its mind. • Iowa. Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, who governs a state with a Republican House and a Democratic Senate, also opted for the state-federal hybrid. He even floated the prospect of creating a joint marketplace with Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota, according to the Quad-City Times. • Nevada. In June 2011, Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval signed a bill passed by the Democratic legislature to create an entirely state-run marketplace. Politico reported that Sandoval is ""arguably doing more to put the Democrats’ signature law into place than any other Republican,"" while risking ""his national ambitions because he’s not actively blocking the president’s law."" • New Mexico. Gov. Susana Martinez -- who, like Nevada’s Sandoval, is a Hispanic seen by some as a rising star within the GOP -- signed legislation passed by the Democratic legislature to create an entirely state-based marketplace. This list does not include the states with GOP governors that decided to expand Medicaid -- another provision of the health care law that has drawn fire from many Republicans. Beyond Michigan and Iowa, Republican governors that signed off on expanding eligibility for Medicaid include Arizona’s Jan Brewer, North Dakota’s Jack Dalrymple and Ohio’s John Kasich. All had Republican-controlled legislatures, populated by GOP lawmakers who, to one degree or another, opposed the governor’s support for expanding Medicaid. Idaho, for its part, did not expand Medicaid. Our ruling Fulcher said that ""Idaho was the only Republican-led state in the nation that chose to partner with President Obama"" by creating a state-based marketplace under the Affordable Care Act. While most states with a Republican governor did refuse to create their own state-run marketplace, Idaho was not the only one. Four other states with Republican governors also created a marketplace that was either fully state-run or was a partnership between the federal government and the state. We rate Fulcher’s claim False. UPDATE, May 19, 2014, 4:00 p.m.: After our story appeared, the Fulcher campaign responded that they had used a different standard than we did to define the term ""Republican-led state."" We interpreted it to mean a state with a Republican governor. The campaign, however, says it was only counting states that had all of the following: a Republican governor, a completely Republican-controlled legislature, and support for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. Using that standard would indeed, make the statement correct. However, we don’t think a listener would find that to be the most obvious interpretation of ""Republican-led state."" In addition, the campaign’s calculations only counted fully state-run marketplaces and excluded the 11 states that use a federal-state partnership for their marketplace, even though Fulcher specifically claimed during the debate that he was talking about states that chose ""to partner with President Obama.""

Hillary Clinton's State Department cut security in Libya before deadly terror attacks, Sen. Ron Johnson says
","With the launch of a new Benghazi investigation, Republicans will once again scrutinize the actions of Hillary Rodham Clinton's State Department in the months leading up to the deadly terrorist attacks in that Libyan port city. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson signaled as much on May 6, 2014, two days before the GOP-led House of Representatives voted to open what by some counts is the eighth Benghazi investigation. In an opinion article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Johnson alleged that a ""dereliction of duty"" by Clinton contributed to the deaths of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans. It wasn’t the first time the Wisconsin Republican took on the Democrats’ front-runner for president in 2016. One of Johnson's high-profile moments in the Senate occurred during a testy exchange with Clinton, then the secretary of state, at a 2013 hearing on Benghazi that led to Clinton’s oft-quoted ""What difference does it make"" comment. In his opinion piece, Johnson singled out the State Department leadership in Washington in saying that ""the greatest outrages occurred before the attack."" ""The State Department not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security, but instead actually reduced security in Libya. Although no one can say with certainty, I firmly believe a relatively small contingent of armed military guards would have prevented the attack, and those four lives would not have been lost."" Is Johnson right -- that before the attacks, the State Department ""failed to honor repeated requests for additional security"" and ""actually reduced security in Libya""? Benghazi background A May 2014 Associated Press news article sets the scene prior to the attacks, which resulted in the first murder of a U.S. ambassador since 1988. Benghazi is where Moammar Gadhafi in 1969 launched a revolution that put him in control of the North African nation. It is also the birthplace of a 2011 revolt that, with the help of NATO warships and planes, deposed and killed the Libyan dictator. A year later, Benghazi remained chaotic, in the grip of heavily armed militias and Islamist militants, some with links to al-Qaida. A temporary U.S. mission in Benghazi had been created in 2011 in hopes of encouraging stability and democracy. It was struck by homemade bombs twice in the spring of 2012 -- two of some 20 security incidents involving the facility, British diplomats, the Red Cross or other Westerners in the months before the deadly assaults. Ambassador Chris Stevens was based at the U.S. embassy in Tripoli, 400 miles west of Benghazi. He decided to visit the Benghazi mission on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, when U.S. embassies around the world were on alert for terrorism. There were seven Americans at the Benghazi mission in the hours leading up to the attacks: Stevens, a communications officer and five security agents -- two of whom had accompanied Stevens and three based at Benghazi. About 9:40 p.m. on Sept. 11, 2012, dozens of armed attackers entered the U.S. compound and set the main building on fire. Stevens and the communications specialist died of smoke inhalation. Early the next morning and about a mile away, mortar fire killed two CIA security contractors at a CIA annex, where Stevens’ body had been taken. First part of Johnson claim The first part of Johnson’s claim is that the State Department ""failed to honor repeated requests for additional security."" His reference is to requests made by Stevens and other U.S. officials in Libya to the State Department leadership in Washington. ""There are disagreements about whether State acted reasonably, but that it didn't honor requests for additional security is established fact,"" said Georgetown University adjunct assistant professor Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, who is also a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which focuses on foreign policy and national security.   The State Department has acknowledged it rejected requests to provide more security personnel in Libya. It also acknowledged rejecting a request to erect guard towers at the Benghazi mission, but notes that a number of physical security upgrades, such as the installation of concrete barriers to block unused gates, were made during 2012. The State Department’s own Accountability Review Board concluded that the number of diplomatic security staff in Benghazi in the months leading up to the attacks was inadequate ""despite repeated requests"" from the Benghazi mission and the embassy in Tripoli for additional staffing. The Benghazi facility had been projected to have five security agents and there had been multiple requests that five be placed there. But in the nine months before the attacks, the facility had a full complement of five agents on only 23 days. After the State Department's security staff in Washington rejected the repeated requests, the post became resigned to not having the full complement of five agents and stopped making the requests, the review board found. A bipartisan report by the Senate Intelligence Committee also found that the State Department headquarters did not grant Stevens' requests for more security personnel. Second part of Johnson claim The second part of Johnson’s claim is that before the attacks, the State Department ""actually reduced security in Libya."" The bipartisan Senate committee found that despite the deteriorating conditions around Benghazi, State Department headquarters decided not to request an extension of service by the Defense Department's Site Security Team, which was scheduled to be redeployed in August 2012, about one month before the attacks. The 16-member team was based in Tripoli, but spent some time in Benghazi and had provided security resources that the State Department could utilize. The State Department opted not to request an extension of the team, the Senate committee found, because it believed that many of the duties could be provided by State Department security staff and local Libyan security personnel. The Senate committee also pointed out that less than a month before the attacks, Stevens ""declined two specific offers"" from the general heading Defense Department operations in Africa to extend the stay of the Site Security Team. But according to Stevens’ top assistant, Gregory Hicks, that was a few weeks after the State Department had already decided not to request the team’s deployment to be extended. Because Washington ""had refused to extend the special forces security mission, State Department protocol required"" Stevens to decline the two offers, Hicks wrote in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. Our rating Johnson said that before the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, ""the State Department not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security, but instead actually reduced security in Libya."" State Department headquarters in Washington did refuse repeated requests from its ambassador in Libya for more security personnel. And it decided not to accept an offer from the Defense Department to extend the stay of one of its security units in Libya, reducing the level of security that was available.

Ron Paul group says Medicaid expansion will cost Virginia taxpayers $902 million
","An organization founded by former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, is urging Virginia House Speaker Bill Howell to stand firm against expanding Medicaid in the Old Dominion. ""Estimates for adopting Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion show it will cost Virginia taxpayers $902 million through 2022,"" says an online petition to Howell that was posted April 29 by the Campaign for Liberty. Paul, who served 25 years in Congress and ran three times for president, retired from the House last year. He set up the Campaign for Liberty in 2008 to promote limited government, non-interventionist foreign policies and opposition to the Federal Reserve System. We wondered whether the claim about estimates showing Medicaid expansion will cost Virginia taxpayers $902 million is correct. So we took a look. The Affordable Care Act -- also known as Obamacare -- gives states the option of expanding Medicaid eligibility to people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line. Uncle Sam will pick up the entire tab for new enrollees during the next two years and pay 90 percent of the cost down the road. The expansion could add as many as 400,000 Virginians to Medicaid’s rolls. The Republican-controlled House of Delegates, led by Howell, has twice refused to broaden the program, saying the federal government can’t be trusted to pay its promised share. A stalemate between the House and the Democratic-controlled Senate is delaying passage of a two-year state budget scheduled to go into effect July 1. When we asked the Campaign for Liberty about the $902 million claim, it cited a year-old graph by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative advocacy and research organization, showing the annual costs and savings Virginia would see through 2022 if it expanded Medicaid. Heritage, in a source note under the graph, said its figures came from a November 2012 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that researches health issues. The Kaiser report Kaiser estimated the total added costs each state would incur from 2013 through 2022 if it expanded Medicaid. It concluded that Virginia would spend about $52.7 billion on Medicaid during that span if it broadened its program and about $51.4 billion if did not. So the gross cost of expansion would be slightly higher than $1.3 billion. The main reason for the increase is that the state in 2017 would begin to assume a small share of the cost of insuring the new enrollees. Virginia’s share would cap at 10 percent in 2020, with the federal government paying the rest. Kaiser then subtracted the largest single source of savings Virginia would receive from expansion. The state would no longer need to pay hospitals and clinics as much for their losses from treating indigent patients -- adults who can’t afford private insurance but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. That, Kaiser estimated, would conserve $424 million through 2022. So Kaiser said the net expansion cost to the state -- slightly more than $1.3 billion minus $424 million -- would come out at $902 million through 2022. But Kaiser stressed twice in its report that its net cost estimates had shortcomings because -- outside of considering savings on indigent care -- it did not examine other economies expanded Medicaid offered states. Its source of data did not provide for more detailed research. Kaiser wrote that its net estimates ""should be considered an overestimate of costs or an underestimate of savings if states were to implement the Medicaid expansion."" The Campaign for Liberty, in relying on this 18-month old estimate on Virginia, neglected a more  current and deeper forecast released in January by state’s Department of Medical Assistance Services, which oversees the Old Dominion’s Medicaid system. The DMAS report The DMAS report contained figures compiled by its actuaries at PriceWaterhouseCoopers.  These figures, based on substantial new research in Virginia and trends found in Medicaid expansion in other states, showed lower costs and much higher savings than previously predicted. Virginia’s cost totaled slightly more than $1.1 billion: The report identified multiple avenues of savings totaling $1.7 billion: The bottom line is DMAS estimated Medicaid expansion would save the state $604 million through 2022. But the longer the state opts out of expansion, the more those savings decline. It should be noted that the expanded coverage will start to cost the state more than it saves during the next decade when Virginia’s 10 percent contribution to cover the added Medicaid enrollees locks in, according to Secretary of Health William Hazel. The state has not released estimates of those long-term costs but Hazel has called them ""manageable."" Finally, you may have noticed a huge difference in Kaiser’s and DMAS’s estimates of the amount Virginia would save on indigent care over 10 years: Kaiser said $434 million; DMAS said $1.1 billion. That’s because Kaiser assumed each state would see a 33 percent drop in their indigent costs if it expanded Medicaid. DMAS estimated Virginia would see an 80 percent reduction in that expense. Our ruling Campaign for Liberty says estimates show Medicaid expansion will cost Virginia taxpayers $902 million over the next decade. One forecast indeed showed that: A 2012 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation offering broad estimates of the net cost expansion for each state. Kaiser stressed in the report that it did not examine all of the savings states might realize and said its net projections ""should be considered an overestimate of costs or an underestimate of savings."" The Campaign for Liberty ignores the most current and detailed study, released in January by Virginia’s Medicaid agency. This report, which examined all avenues for savings based on updated trends, concluded Medicaid expansion would save the state $604 million through 2022. The campaign’s use of the plural ""estimates"" suggests there’s broad agreement Medicaid expansion will cost Virginia taxpayers $902 million. Not so. So the campaign’s statement has an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/may/19/campaign-liberty/ron-paul-group-says-medicaid-expansion-will-cost-v/

Jerry Brown says 'virtually no Republican' in Washington accepts climate change science
","More than 1,500 wildfires have ravaged California so far in 2014, more than twice the state sees in an average year. On ABC’s This Week, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, cited scientific research that links the increased number of fires to the state’s changing climate. Host George Stephanopoulos asked Brown how he’d adapt to the future, given skepticism among Republicans in Washington. Short answer: not easily. ""That's a challenge,"" Brown said. ""It is true that there's virtually no Republican who accepts the science that virtually is unanimous. I mean there is no scientific question. There's just political denial for various reasons, best known to those people who are in denial."" Brown then pivoted away from Washington to say that ""we here in California are on the front lines, we got to deal with it."" PolitiFact decided to take a closer look at how Republicans in Congress perceive climate change. We are focusing on Republicans in Washington because that’s how the question to Brown was framed. Republicans more skeptical about climate change Recent national polls say that Republican voters are less likely than Democrats and independents to believe humans cause global warming. Among Republicans, tea party Republicans are even less likely to accept the science than the party base. Among current Republicans in Congress, a group of 278, we were able to find many examples of politicians questioning climate change science to some degree. Most recently, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., made waves for denying a link between human activity and climate change. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,"" Rubio told Jonathan Karl on ABC’s This Week May 11. ""And I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it. Except it will destroy our economy."" That’s in line with other prominent Republicans, such as House Majority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Organizing for Action, a group that backs President Barack Obama, published a lengthy list of climate change deniers in Congress, with evidence to back each one. Still others, like Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have notably changed on the issue, even after co-authoring legislation to address the issue. Republicans who say they believe the science We found relatively few Republican members of Congress who accept the prevailing scientific conclusion that global warming is both real and man-made. Brown’s office didn’t return our request for comment, so we are unable to compare our evidence to any that he might have. Rep. Michael Grimm, R-N.Y.: Grimm was a notable skeptic until April 2014, when he told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes, ""The mass majority of respected scientists say that it’s conclusive, the evidence is clear. So I don’t think the jury is out. There’s no question that, you know, the oceans have risen, right? And the climate change part is, is a real part of it."" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine: Collins worked with Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., on a climate change bill in 2009 that proposed an alternative to cap-and-trade cutting carbon dioxide emissions. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn.: ""I am one senator who thinks climate change is a problem, humans are causing it, and we need to deal with it,"" he said at an Environment and Public Works Committee hearing in 2009. Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill.: He’s called climate change a ""long-term concern."" Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J.:  ""Climate change is a global challenge that must be addressed with a global solution,"" he said in 2007 as he backed a climate change provision in a House bill. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn.: ""I accept the fact that we as a country, and we as a world, need to address this issue,"" he said on the Senate floor in 2008. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D.: When asked if he thought global warming was man-made, he said, ""I’m not denying that."" Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J.: ""Do I believe in climate change? I do, yeah,"" he told National Journal in 2011. ""With the weather patterns over the past five years. … What causes it? Quite honestly, I don’t know. … Humans have some effect on climate change. There’s so many factors."" That’s eight out of 278, or about 3 percent. Are there others? It’s possible. Not every member of Congress has taken a clear stance on climate change, and we can’t read people’s minds. If we find more examples, we’ll update our list. Former Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., told PolitiFact that the number of Republicans like himself who stand by climate change science has been shrinking in recent years, due to a more polarized Congress. ""There used to be a lot more of us,"" said Greenwood, who serves on the board of directors for the National Audubon Society. ""A lot of us were very green in our voting records. That has changed. I think it's part of the phenomenon of the polarization of the Congress."" Agreeing with climate change science also could be a political liability for Republicans. In 2010, South Carolina Rep. Bob Inglis lost a Republican primary to tea party challenger Trey Gowdy. Inglis blamed his loss, in part, over his belief in climate science. Inglis has since formed the Energy and Enterprise Initiative, a conservative group that agrees with climate change science. Energy and Enterprise Initiative spokesman Price Atkinson said Republicans support efforts to reduce CO2 emissions but criticize the way Obama and Democrats want to go about it. ""There are many Republicans in Washington who accept, understand and agree with sound science regarding climate change, but it's the way forward that is more difficult for my fellow conservatives,"" Atkinson said. ""We agree with fellow conservatives in opposing the president and the growth of government thru increased EPA regulations, which is precisely the worst way to reduce carbon emissions."" The charged political climate makes finding clear positions on climate change from many Republicans tough to come by, say experts who follow the issue. ""Most Republicans say the same thing behind closed doors: ‘Of course, I get that the climate is changing, of course I get that we need to do something — but I need to get reelected,’ "" Audubon Society President David Yarnold told National Journal in 2013. ""Somehow they’re going to have to find a safe place on this."" Our ruling Brown said that ""virtually no Republican"" in Washington accepts climate change science. When it comes to on-the-record comments of members of Congress, Brown’s characterization is about right. We found at least eight Republicans in Congress who publicly voiced support for the scientific consensus and many more conservative legislators who deny either a human link to the changing climate, or the fact that the climate is changing altogether. A reason for caution, however, is comments from someone like Yarnold — who suggest GOP members of Congress acknowledge climate change science behind closed doors but avoid the talk in public for political reasons. We rate Brown’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/may/18/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-says-virtually-no-republican-believes-/
