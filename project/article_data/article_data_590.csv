Rick Scott increased preschool funding, Republican Party says
","On the campaign trail, Gov. Rick Scott has appeared in a charming video alongside his toddler grandson and a darling photo with Florida preschoolers. So we know he likes cute little kids. But does he invest in them? A new ad by the Republican Party of Florida portrays him as generously funding preschool education. The Spanish-language ad ""Dedicación"" shows teachers warmly talking about their profession -- and Scott. ""I like being a special education teacher because many people don’t see the potential of those students,"" says one teacher. ""It's a profession of great dedication,"" says another. The teachers continue: ""With Rick Scott, there are more funds for preschool education and that’s very important to me. Florida students are better off due to Scott. They can repeat all the falsehoods they want, the facts don’t lie."" Under Scott, are there more funds for preschool education? We decided to do some homework. VPK funding under Scott The Republican Party’s backup for the ad cited a press release distributed by Scott’s office in March about his proposal for a $100 per child increase for voluntary pre-kindergarten, called VPK. VPK is a program for 4-year-olds launched in 2005 after voters approved it in a referendum and is free for all participants regardless of income. The purpose of VPK is to prepare children for kindergarten -- they learn how to identify shapes and colors, write their own name, recognize letters and recognize patterns, among other skills. The program is offered at public schools and private day care centers. Children can enroll in a VPK school-year program that typically translates to three hours a day -- though many parents pay for additional ""wrap-around"" hours. (A smaller group of children use a version in the summer.) Though Scott requested a $100 per student increase this year, the Legislature settled on a $54 increase. The Republicans arrived at their claim that ""there are more funds for preschool education"" based on the amount the state appropriated each year.    For 2010-11 -- the last budget set under Crist -- the Legislature appropriated about $404 million -- including $73 million in federal stimulus dollars. (Crist was a champion of the federal stimulus, while Scott campaigned against it.) The amount of state money appropriated would later peak under Scott at $413 million. But the total amount appropriated tells us nothing about the key dollar figure for parents: what is spent per child. The Legislature and the governor set the per-pupil amount each session and appropriate a total based on an estimate of enrollment. But Florida will spend the amount necessary to pay the per-pupil amount for all children who enroll. ""The per-pupil is probably the fairest way to compare years -- the (total) dollar amount depends on how many kids"" enroll, Bill Ammons, Office of Early Learning budget director told PolitiFact Florida. Ammons’ office sent us the amount of state money spent on VPK under Crist and Scott. The per-pupil amount fell during Scott’s first budget -- 2011-12 -- but that was after the federal stimulus ran out. Then per-pupil funding remained stagnant for three years followed by a small increase. Year Appropriated Expended Per-pupil school year 2010-11 $404 million* $399 million $2,562 2011-12 $385 million $392 million $2,383 2012-13 $413 million $390 million $2,383 2013-14 $405 million $378 million** $2,383 2014-15 $396 million Not known yet $2,437 * This included $332 million in state money and $73 million in federal stimulus dollars ** Entire amount won’t be known until after September. The drop in per-pupil funding followed by stagnant funding didn’t impact every school the same way. Some schools that served wealthier students who paid for day care were able to absorb the state funding drop more easily than schools that serve primarily poor children and rely on state money. ""The VPK decrease is miniscule but so many are at the brink, every dollar counts,"" said David McGerald, CEO of the Early Learning Coalition of Hillsborough County, which oversees VPK. ""Providers who serve ‘private pay’ parents are much more likely to thrive and provide a quality program."" Florida ranks 35th in state spending for preschool, according to The National Institute for Early Education Research’s report about the 2012-13 school year. (We previously fact-checked a claim by Scott about access to VPK based on the prior year’s report.) Our ruling A Republican Party ad said that Scott has overseen ""more funds for preschool education."" The Republicans point to the fact that the Legislature approved slightly higher overall appropriations in some years. But per-pupil spending fell during Scott's first year, after federal stimulus funds ran out. Then, for the next few years, the per-pupil amount remained flat. Per-pupil spending still isn't as high as it was in the budget that was approved the year before Scott took office. The statement contains an element of truth but leaves out key details, so we rate this statement Mostly False.","[('Republican Party of Florida, ""Dedicación"" TV ad, July 22, 2014', 'https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/mar/14/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-says-poorest-40-percent-texans-pay-mo/'), ('Gov.

DNC Chair says Fourth Circuit court used pizza analogy to uphold health care law
","What does cheap pizza have to do with health care — other than if you eat too much, you might need to see a doctor? Apparently, it’s the perfect metaphor to explain why a key provision in the Affordable Care Act is legal. That’s what we heard from Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. During a July 22 Las Vegas TV appearance, the Florida congresswoman discussed two new dueling court decisions on the health care law. She said the court that sided with President Barack Obama’s administration made a compelling, albeit cheesy, argument. ""The language in the Fourth Circuit actually compared if you buy a pizza from Pizza Hut to a pizza from Dominoes,"" Wasserman Schultz said. ""And if you ask for ham and pepperoni on your Pizza Hut pizza, but then I actually go get your pizza from Domino’s, it’s implied if I bring back a pepperoni and ham pizza, then that’s what you asked for."" Hold the sauce! Is this really what the court said, or did Wasserman Schultz slice the ruling? Let’s take a look. The challenge On Tuesday, two appeals courts issued rulings on whether the federal government had the authority to provide subsidies for people who purchased coverage on the federal government’s health insurance marketplace. Why is that an issue? The government directed each state to set up a marketplace where insurance providers could sell policies to uninsured residents. But if a state decided not to take this step, the federal government said it would step in and do it for them. As it stands, only 14 states are operating their own exchanges. Many of the people purchasing coverage in these marketplaces are low-income residents who are unable to afford policies without assistance. To help pay for coverage, the federal government provides subsidies in the form of tax credits to buy insurance. But, as written, the law says that the subsidies apply to insurance bought on exchanges ""established by the State."" In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said that clause means people in the 36 states without state-based exchanges cannot buy discounted policies. If upheld, millions of people would have to pay more for their policies or lose their coverage. Just hours later, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued its own decision in a similar case. In a 3-0 ruling, the court said that the way the law is written is at worst ambiguous, and that the Obama administration interpreted the law in a ""permissible"" fashion. That means everyone who’s bought the discounted policies would still get the credits. Pizza! Pizza! In a concurring opinion, Judge Andre Davis said he supported the Fourth Circuit Court’s decision to side with the Obama administration. But he didn’t see the law as that ambiguous. Quoting from the law, Davis wrote that the Department of Health and Human Services was instructed to ""establish and operate such exchange within the State and … take such actions as are necessary to implement such other requirements."" Giving Health and Human services the power to operate ""such"" an exchange also gives them the ability to provide tax credits, Davis wrote. Davis then served up this pizza-ordering scenario, presumably experienced by every college student at one time or another: ""If I ask for pizza from Pizza Hut for lunch but clarify that I would be fine with a pizza from Domino’s, and I then specify that I want ham and pepperoni on my pizza from Pizza Hut, my friend who returns from Domino’s with a ham and pepperoni pizza has still complied with a literal construction of my lunch order. That is this case: Congress specified that Exchanges should be established and run by the states, but the contingency provision permits federal officials to act in place of the state when it fails to establish an Exchange."" Got it? More importantly, did Wasserman Schultz get it? Yes…ish. First, and this is critical, Wasserman Schultz implied this was the opinion for the Fourth Circuit Court. It’s not. This is a concurring opinion from one judge who agreed with the ultimate decision, but added his own twist that wasn’t endorsed by the entire panel. That’s key. The second issue is pizza semantics. Wasserman Schultz said that if you order a pizza from Pizza Hut, it doesn’t matter where it comes from, as long as you get the toppings — ham and pepperoni — on the pizza you ordered. That’s not exactly what Judge Davis said. In Davis’ scenario, the person said in advance they wanted Pizza Hut, but they would be okay with Domino’s. Without that distinction, the pizza could also come from Papa John’s. Davis did not say Papa John’s would be okay, and we also have to note that Papa John’s does not offer ham as a topping (though a spokesman said patrons could order its foreign brother, Canadian bacon). Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said the Fourth Circuit Court in its ruling wrote, ""If you ask for ham and pepperoni on your Pizza Hut pizza but then I actually go get your pizza from Domino’s, it’s implied if I bring back a pepperoni and ham pizza then that’s what you asked for."" This wasn’t the ruling of the entire three-member court, just one judge’s concurring opinion. And she did miss the distinction that the person ordering the pizza said in advance they wanted Pizza Hut, but would be ""fine with a pizza from Domino’s."" We rate the statement Mostly True.","[('NBC News 3, Ralston Report interview with Rep.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz says GOP governors blocked state insurance markets in 36 states
","Two recent federal court cases, both about federal subsidies for health insurance, came within hours of each other this week, putting the future of the Affordable Care Act into question. In Halbig vs. Burwell, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a 2-1 ruling that said people in states that don't operate their own marketplaces can't get subsidies. But a few hours later, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion in King vs. Burwell. Their unanimous decision upheld the legality of the subsidies for all states, even those without their own insurance marketplaces. That same day Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chair and congresswoman from Florida, appeared on the Nevada news program Ralston Reports. ""There was a lot of panic from supporters of the law after the Halbig decision came down from the panel at the D.C. court,"" said host Jon Ralston. But Wasserman Schultz said she thought it would be resolved in favor of maintaining the subsides for all states. ""I think ultimately, when the Supreme Court decides this, it’s going to be very clear that the unanimous ruling by the Fourth Circuit is the right one."" She also said Nevada had ""a governor who refused to implement a state exchange."" She quickly had to backtrack as Ralston reminded her of Gov. Brian Sandoval’s enthusiastic support of a state exchange. ""Well, I stand corrected, I’m not from Nevada,"" Wasserman Schultz acknowledged. But she went on to make another claim we found questionable. ""There were 36 states where Republicans who were in charge refused to implement a state exchange, and as a result people who get Affordable Care Act plans are getting them through the federal exchange,"" Wasserman Schultz said. It turns out that Wasserman Schultz was off on this claim, too. Numbers don’t lie Using information compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation, we looked at each state’s marketplace profile. We found a total of 36 states that currently use the federal exchange or state-federal partnerships and would be affected by Halbig vs. Burwell. We sorted them into four categories. States with Republican governors that adopted the federal exchange: 27 States with Democratic governors that adopted the federal exchange: 2 States with Republican governors that adopted a state-federal partnership: 2 States with Democratic governors that adopted state-federal partnership: 5 So of the 36 states that use the federal exchange or a partnership program, only 29 actually had Republican governors when the decisions were made about establishing health care marketplaces. In 27 of those states, Republican governors opted to use the federally established marketplace, Heathcare.gov, instead of a state-run program. This number includes New Mexico and Idaho, whose Republican governors originally aimed to establish state-based marketplaces in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Both states ended up choosing a federally-facilitated marketplace but hope to open their own state-based marketplaces in 2014. It also includes Utah, a state that had an insurance marketplace established before the Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010. In Utah, the federal government runs the market for individual insurance, but the state controls the insurance exchange for small businesses. There are two Republican-led states, Iowa and Michigan, that supported independent state marketplaces, but ended up establishing state-federal partnerships instead. State-federal partnerships allow the states to play a role in the insurance marketplace, without assuming full responsibility. In 2012, Iowa Republican Gov. Terry Branstad announced that the state would operate on a state-federal partnership for the time being. Branstad said they plan to transition to a state insurance marketplace by 2016. And in Michigan, Republican Gov. Rick Snyder supported the creation of a state-based marketplace, but opted for the partnership in 2012. Republican governors were not alone in their decision to use the federal exchange or set up state-federal partnerships. Seven states with Democratic governors did it, too. Of the seven states, two use the federal exchange, while five operate partnership marketplaces. For example, in Missouri, Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon  attempted to set up a state marketplace in 2012, but voters blocked his attempts. Ultimately, Nixon was forced to back away from a state marketplace. In Montana, Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer opted for the federally run insurance marketplace. The other five Democratic states that operate a state-federal partnership are New Hampshire, Delaware, West Virginia, Illinois and Arkansas. In New Hampshire, Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan established the partnership marketplace in February of 2013. Illinois Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn laid out a plan similar to that used in Iowa. The state is currently using a partnership exchange, but plans to establish a state marketplace by 2015. DNC spokesman Michael Czin said that Wasserman Schultz meant to say there were ""26 Republican governors who used the federal exchange this year instead of setting up their own state-based exchange."" Czin was counting the number of states now that have Republican governors. We think it’s more accurate to counts states that had Republican governors when the exchanges were set up, and that number would be 27 (not counting the two GOP governors that set up partnership exchanges). Our ruling  Wasserman Schultz said that there were ""36 states where Republicans who were in charge refused to implement a state exchange."" There are 36 states that use the federal exchange or state-federal partnerships instead of state-based marketplaces. But seven of those states are run by Democrats. And, some of the states with Republican governors, like New Mexico and Idaho, tried to institute a state exchange before opting for federally-facilitated marketplace. So while most of the 36 states had Republican governors, not all of them did. We rate this statement Mostly False.","[('NBC News 3, Ralston Report interview with Rep.

Assistant district attorneys didn't get raises for over 10 years, attorney general candidate says
","In campaigning for state attorney general, state Rep. Jon Richards made a claim that made us wonder how prosecutors in district attorney’s offices across Wisconsin have been getting by. In a video released June 16, 2014, the Milwaukee Democrat stated: ""Last year, I was involved with an effort to to help prosecutors get their first pay raise in more than 10 years."" No raises for more than a decade? No. But let us explain. The background The main job of the state's locally elected district attorneys and the assistants they hire is to prosecute felony and misdemeanor crimes, as well as well juvenile cases, in circuit court. Wisconsin has 72 counties but 71 district attorneys, as one DA serves both Menominee and Shawano counties. The assistant district attorneys were county employees until 1990, when a change in state law made them state employees and allowed them to collectively bargain for wages. The pay for the assistants has been a concern for years. A University of Wisconsin-Madison study in 2011 that called for raises found that dating back 2005, annual turnover among assistant district attorneys exceeded 18 percent. Richards’ evidence We asked Richards campaign spokesman Sachin Chheda for evidence to back the claim that Richards helped get prosecutors their first pay raise in more than 10 years. He suggested we contact David Feiss, a Milwaukee County assistant district attorney and president of the Association of State Prosecutors, the statewide union for assistant DAs. Feiss told us it would be wrong to say the state’s prosecutors have not received any pay raises in more than a decade. Indeed, contracts that the union negotiated with the state provided a number of across-the-board raises, as the UW-Madison study noted:   Year pay raise effective Amount of raise 2004 1 percent, plus 10 cents/hour, plus $250 lump sum 2005 2 percent 2006 2 percent 2007 April: 2.25 percent; July: 2 percent plus $1.25/hour 2008 1 percent So, how can Richards claim there were no raises? Feiss pointed out to us that the contract covering 2003-’05, unlike previous contracts, contained no provision for merit pay raises and that subsequent contracts have not, either. In other words, assistant district attorneys couldn’t advance in pay beyond the across-the-board raises. That changed after the Legislature in 2012 created a new merit pay structure, which was implemented as part of the 2013-’15 state budget. As Richards noted, he helped lead that effort. The new pay progression plan consists of 18 hourly salary steps, from $49,429 on the low end to $119,471 at the top. Each step is worth $4,120. Effective in July 2013, prosecutors were moved up in pay by one step. And going forward, based on merit, they can get a raise of one step or more each year, although the total annual raise cannot exceed 10 percent. Our rating Richards said that in 2013, he ""was involved with an effort to to help prosecutors get their first pay raise in more than 10 years."" Since a merit pay system was eliminated in 2003, assistant district attorneys could not get merit raises or ""step"" raises -- to a higher place on the pay scale -- until a new merit and step-pay system was put in place in 2013, with Richards’ help. But prior to that, they received across-the-board raises for five consecutive years, from 2004 through 2008. We rate Richards’ statement False.

Mayor Angel Taveras says crime rate, shootings have decreased in Providence
","Providence is known for a lot of great things. One thing it doesn't want to be known for is the gun violence that regularly makes headlines. On Monday, July 14, 2014, the NAACP tried to rally support for a five-point program to deal with street crime, including providing more job opportunities in low-income communities. That was a week after five people were injured in a July 8 drive-by shooting. In anticipation of that news conference, Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, a Democrat currently running for governor, said there have been signs of hope dealing with the problem. ""If you look at what we’ve done over the last several years, the crime rate has actually gone down in the city, and in terms of violence as well, we know the number of shootings has been going down year from year,"" he told The Providence Journal. ""Several"" is a vague word. But because he prefaced his statement by saying, ""If you look at what we've done,"" we'll assume he's referring to his tenure as mayor, which began in January 2011. We contacted Taveras' office and spokesman David Ortiz provided data from the Providence police. We should note that the crime rate in the United States --  both violent crimes and property crimes -- has been declining steadily for at least the last 20 years, according to the FBI, so any reduction would not be unique to Providence. We've looked at Providence crime rates before. On December 30, Brett Smiley, now a Democratic candidate for mayor, earned a Mostly True when he said, ""Of all cities in the United States with more than 100,000 people, Providence is the 183rd safest."" Prior to that, on July 19, 2010, we gave former mayor David Cicilline a True for his statement that Providence had ""the lowest crime rate in three decades."" We found that, at the time, for 2009 the crime rate was the lowest in 44 years. Has the crime rate and the number of shootings gone down in recent years, as Taveras claims? To determine the crime rate, we used U.S. Census Bureau data for Providence combined with an updated count of crime incidents from the Providence police, as reported to the Rhode Island State Police and the FBI, from 2000 through 2013. (We spot-checked the data with reports on the FBI website.) The rates for total crimes -- including both violent crime and property crime -- have bounced around a bit from year to year but the trend is down. The rate was 52.4 incidents per 1,000 population in 2009 -- the year we used for the Cicilline fact check. It ticked up to 53.7 in 2010, and rose to 54.3 in 2011, which marked Taveras' first year in office. It dropped to 51.9 the following year and was 51.7 in 2013. Based on our research for this item and our Cicilline fact check, that 2013 rate was the lowest in 48 years. A reduction in property crimes -- burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft was responsible for most of the reduction. Such crimes make up roughly seven out of every eight crimes committed in the capital city. The 2013 violent crime rate was 6.7 per 1,000, the lowest since 2007. And what about the number of shootings? Because car backfires and fireworks might sound like a gunshot, the Police Department does not track reports of shootings, according to the city's public safety commissioner, Steven Pare. Taveras' spokesman, Ortiz, said that ""When the mayor spoke of shootings, he was referencing the reports he gets regarding shooting victims. The mayor does not get reports regarding shots fired, and that is not at all what he meant."" So we got data on shooting victims from Providence police. In 2011, Taveras' first year in office, the number of shooting victims jumped sharply to 108. That's 18 more than in 2010. The number had been rising steadily -- there were 47 shooting victims in 2006, the first year of the statistics provided by Ortiz. But in 2012, the number declined to 105, then to 100 in 2013. And as of July 12, the day Taveras made his statement, there were 61 shooting victims so far this year, the exact same number as of July 12, 2013. We will note for the record that crime rates are down nationally and Providence's rate had been declining long before Taveras took office. Our ruling Angel Taveras said, ""Over the last several years, the crime rate has actually gone down in the city and . . .  the number of shootings has been going down."" While the overall rate ticked up the year before Taveras took office and during the first year of his tenure, it has declined by a few percentage points in the last two years, reflecting the long-term trend. Similarly, the number of shooting victims made a significant jump the first year Taveras was in office. The number has fallen since then, but in 2013, it was still 10 higher than the year before he became mayor. The count as of July 12 --  the date of Taveras' statement -- was not lower than the same time last year; it was identical. All things considered, the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

Club for Growth says N.H. gas tax enacted when prices were 'skyrocketing'
","New Hampshire voters are famously unenthusiastic about tax hikes, so it’s no surprise that the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative group, is making hay of the state’s recent gasoline tax hike in an ad that’s intended to bolster a Republican congressional candidate. The ad -- part of what the group is calling a ""six-figure"" television buy -- aims to ""thank"" GOP state Rep. Marilinda Garcia for opposing higher taxes and spending in the Legislature. Garcia is running in the Sept. 9 Republican primary for a U.S. House race. The 2nd district seat, representing the western half of the state, is currently held by Democrat Ann McLane Kuster. Here’s the ad’s narration: ""Across New Hampshire, taxes are going up, and families are hurting. With gas prices skyrocketing, the Legislature raised our gas tax. State budgets are growing by hundreds of millions. What’s next, an income tax? One representative has taken the lead to say no -- Marilinda Garcia. She knows government has gotten too big. Conservative Marilinda Garcia is fighting for more freedom and less government. Thank Marilinda for opposing higher taxes and spending."" When we looked into it, we found that the Club for Growth’s claim that prices were ""skyrocketing"" isn’t supported by the data. A little background: Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan signed the tax increase into law on May 20, 2014, after the Democratic-controlled state House and the Republican-controlled state Senate passed the measure. It added 4.2 cents in tax to each gallon of gasoline sold, effective July 1, 2014. The proceeds -- an estimated $32 million annually -- are to be spent on road and infrastructure projects, including the widening of Interstate 93. The tax hike marks the first time the state has raised the gas tax since 1991. The bill that became the gas tax hike was introduced in the state Senate on Jan. 8, 2014. (It was introduced in the House later.) So we looked at how the state’s gasoline prices moved between Jan. 8 and May 20, when Hassan signed the measure. According to gasbuddy.com, a website that tracks gasoline prices in a wide range of states and cities, New Hampshire gasoline prices were $3.42 around Jan. 8 and rose to $3.61 around May 20. That’s an increase of 6 percent -- rising, but not exactly ""skyrocketing."" And gas prices haven't skyrocketed since Hassan signed the bill, either. Between the bill signing and the effective date of the increase, gas prices in New Hampshire rose from $3.61 to $3.68. Then, since July 1 they've fallen, from $3.68 to $3.55. If you take an even longer view, the term ""skyrocketing"" becomes even less apt. For a significant portion of the previous three years, gas prices were higher than they were when the bill was signed on May 20, 2014, peaking at $3.91 in September 2012. Smaller spikes, each higher than $3.69 a gallon, occurred in July 2011, April 2012, February 2013 and July 2013. The same general pattern holds region-wide. Data from the federal Energy Information Administration shows that gas prices in New England as a whole rose from $3.63 when the bill was introduced to $3.80 when it was signed -- an increase of 5 percent, or well short of ""skyrocketing."" According to the American Automobile Association, seeing a rise in gas prices on this scale is typical for the period from January to May. Gas prices usually are cheapest in the winter because people drive less, reducing gasoline demand. Prices generally rise through the spring, when refineries conduct maintenance between peak demand for heating oil in the winter and gasoline in the summer, among other reasons. ""It can be a shock to see prices rise significantly in the springtime, and no one wants to pay more for the same product,"" said Michael Green, a spokesman for AAA’s national office. ""With that in mind, it is understandable why consumers might feel that gas prices are skyrocketing at times."" But Green said it’s important to keep some context in mind. ""Every year, someone could say that gas prices are ‘skyrocketing’ by comparing Jan. 1 to May 20,"" he said. ""But that comparison would only tell a small part of the story."" The rest of the story is that gasoline prices have actually been coming down modestly in recent years, Green said. In New Hampshire, the average price of gas on May 20, 2014, was lower than it was on that date in 2011 ($3.90) and 2012 ($3.70) and was only a little higher than it was on that date in 2013 ($3.46), Green said. ""The most important trend we see is that gas prices are a little less expensive than in recent years due to the recent boom in North American crude oil production,"" he said. ""Consumers are not saving huge amounts of money, but prices absolutely are not ‘skyrocketing’ higher when compared to previous years."" For what it’s worth, a July 2014 survey by the University of New Hampshire found that, as a whole, New Hampshire voters support the gas tax increase. In all, 52 percent said they favor it, compared to 40 percent who said they opposed it. Unlike Democrats and independents, Republicans -- the direct target of the ad, since Garcia must win the GOP primary -- narrowly opposed the hike (43 percent in favor, 47 percent against). Self-described conservatives were the most negative about it (36 percent in favor, 60 percent opposed). The Club for Growth did not return an inquiry for this article. Our ruling The Club for Growth ad said the New Hampshire legislature raised the gasoline tax at a time when gas prices in the state were ""skyrocketing."" Gas prices in New Hampshire rose modestly -- about 5 percent -- between the bill’s introduction and its signing, mostly, experts say, because of cyclical increases related to refinery maintenance and other reasons. Not only is that short of ""skyrocketing,"" but the price of gasoline at the time the bill was signed was actually lower than it had been at multiple points over the previous three years. We rate the claim False.","[('Club for Growth, ""Hurting"" (ad), July 21, 2014', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fir4F0uvEp8'), ('Club for Growth, ""New Club for Growth TV Ad Campaign: Thank Marilinda Garcia For Opposing Higher Taxes And Spending,"" July 21, 2014', 'No link'), ('Text of Senate Bill 367', 'http://www.clubforgrowth.org/government-spending/new-club-growth-tv-ad-campaign-thank-marilinda-garcia-opposing-higher-taxes-spending/'), ('gasbuddy.com, regular gasoline prices in New Hampshire (chart), accessed July 23, 2014', 'No link'), ('Energy Information Administration, Weekly New England All Grades All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices, accessed July 27, 2014', 'http://gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2014/SB0367.html'), ('New Hampshire Department of Transportation, ""SB 367 - Transportation Funding for New Hampshire,"" accessed July 23, 2014', 'No link'), ('New Hampshire Public Radio, ""N.H.\'s Gas Tax Increase: Where Your Money Is Going,"" July 1, 2014', 'about:blank'), ('OpenStates.org, summary page on New Hampshire Senate Bill 367, accessed July 23, 2014', 'No link'), ('University of New Hampshire Survey Center, ""NH Aware of Gas Tax Increase, Small Majority Support It,"" July 22, 2014', 'https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPM0_PTE_R1X_DPG&f=W'), ('howstuffworks.com, ""Why is summer fuel more expensive than winter fuel?"" accessed July 23, 2014', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Dante Scala, political scientist at the University of New Hampshire, July 23, 2014', 'http://www.nh.gov/dot/road-toll/'), ('Email interview with Andrew Smith, political scientist at the University of New Hampshire, July 23, 2014', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Michael Green, spokesman for the national staff of the American Automobile Association, July 23, 2014', 'http://nhpr.org/post/nhs-gas-tax-increase-where-your-money-going')]",/factchecks/2014/jul/23/club-growth/club-growth-says-nh-gas-tax-enacted-when-prices-we/
"['Oregon', 'Education', 'Dennis Richardson']","
Does Oregon rank 49th in the nation for its high-school graduation rate?
 ","Oregon Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, hopes to unseat Democratic incumbent Gov. John Kitzhaber in November’s general election. The two met in their first debate July 18, during which Kitzhaber portrayed himself as a problem-solver who works effectively across the aisle. Richardson pointed to problems with the doomed Columbia River Crossing bridge project and the disastrous rollout of Cover Oregon, the state’s health insurance exchange. The claim: Richardson, in assessing Kitzhaber’s record in office, singled out failures of the state’s educational system. ""We are 49th in the nation for our graduation rate,"" he said. Is Oregon nearly at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to U.S. high school graduation rates? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: We emailed the Richardson campaign, which sent us a link to a Feb. 7, 2014, article by Betsy Hammond, the state education reporter for The Oregonian. The article’s headline: ""Oregon’s high school graduation rate second-worst in nation."" The results, from the high school class of 2012, taken from the 2011-12 school year, showed Oregon’s rate above only Nevada’s when it came to our ""regulatory adjusted cohort graduation rate""; that is, the percentage of students who entered the ninth grade in 2008-09 and graduated on time four years later in June 2012. The numbers came from the U.S. Department of Education’s second-ever compilation of comparable state-by-state graduation rates. For 2012, the numbers show, Nevada ranked dead last, at 63 percent, with Oregon next-worst, at 68 percent. Iowa topped the list, with an 89 percent four-year graduation rate.But three states, Idaho, Kentucky and Oklahoma, did not submit their rates, saying they lacked the ability to track all students. So Oregon was actually No. 46 out of 47 states, not No. 49. If the three other states had submitted their rates, it’s conceivable that Oregon could have climbed anywhere from one to three spots higher. For the class of 2011, Oregon’s graduation was fourth-worst among the same 47 states, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics. By in 2011-12, New Mexico and Georgia surged ahead, leaving the Beaver State a step from the basement. We called Crystal Greene, communications director for the Oregon Department of Education, who said that while the four-year rate is the gold standard, other measures exist. Those include five-year programs that allow students to remain enrolled in high school while attending community colleges, ""modified"" diplomas for special education students, diplomas awarded to adults, and GEDs. Including students who received modified diplomas and GEDs, she said, takes Oregon’s ""completer rate"" to 80 percent. But, she said, official state reports on graduation rates don’t include those numbers. The Oregonian has also found that outcomes for students who earn GEDs, in particular, are far worse than those for high school graduates, meaning the credentials are far from equivalent. Still, she acknowledged that the four-year rate -- considered by both state and federal education officials as the correct way to measure graduation rates nationally -- places Oregon near the bottom. The ruling: State Rep. Dennis Richardson, in taking on Gov. John Kitzhaber, stated during a recent debate that Oregon ranks 49th in high school graduation rates. He based the number on a news story that looked at state-by-state numbers for the 2011-12 school year from the U.S. Department of Education. The story’s headline said Oregon had the nation’s ""second-worst"" rate. That’s correct. But because only 47 states submitted data, it’s incorrect to say Oregon came in 49th. Richardson’s claim is close but needs clarification. We rate the claim Mostly True. Thoughts on this PolitiFact Oregon piece?

Rick Perry claim about 3,000 homicides by illegal immigrants not supported by state figures
","Texas Gov. Rick Perry expressed concern about border-crossing immigrants committing crimes, going on to tell Glenn Beck in a July 17, 2014, interview ""the number of illegal activities up to and including homicides--I think over 3,000 homicides by illegal aliens over the course of the last six years; that’s unacceptable and that’s the reason that we have to secure that border."" That sounded like a lot of killings by unauthorized residents. (Where were those headlines?) Perry's backup We decided to put Perry's number to the Texas Truth-O-Meter, starting with Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed, who told us to consult the Texas Department of Public Safety. DPS Director Steve McCraw referred to that many homicides in his July 3, 2014, testimony to the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security. After saying the ""consequences of an unsecured border with Mexico"" undermine public safety, McCraw said: ""Another consequence seldom discussed is the high number of criminal aliens arrested for non-immigration crimes throughout Texas."" He then mentioned ""over 3,000 homicides"" since 2008. Asked for elaboration, a DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, pointed to an agency web page, ""Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data,"" stating that since January 2012, a monthly average of 5,899 ""foreign nationals"" -- individuals legally authorized to live in the U.S. or not -- have been arrested in Texas, with 40 percent having been arrested before on a criminal charge. Also on the page: ""From October 2008 through July 1, 2014, Texas has identified a total of 203,685 unique criminal alien defendants booked into Texas county jails. Over their criminal careers, these defendants are responsible for at least 642,564 individual criminal charges mostly consisting of Class B misdemeanors or higher, including 3,070 homicides and 7,964 sexual assaults,"" the agency says. The web page includes a pie chart tallying the criminal charges accumulated by the defendants:  Source: Web page, ""Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data,"" Texas Department of Public Safety (accessed July 21, 2014) The last line on the page says ""these are minimum figures as these numbers include only those aliens whose fingerprints were already in the federal system when they were booked and it does not necessarily include all those who are incarcerated in federal prison."" We asked Vinger for more detail about the homicide charges. We especially wondered how many charges had been leveled since the  flow of children crossing the border started to escalate in 2011. Vinger replied by email, ""We don’t have any additional information."" Outside criminologists Next, we explored whether Perry accurately cited the DPS information. To rehash, the governor told Beck more than 3,000 homicides had been committed by ""illegal aliens"" since 2008. However, the DPS web page doesn’t say that; it doesn’t even specify when (or where) the 3,070 homicide charges in the criminal histories of all the ""alien"" individuals arrested in Texas since October 2008 accumulated. Via the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, we reached criminologists who looked over the DPS presentation. Michael Walker, an adjunct John Jay professor and an expert in how the FBI gathers crime statistics, said the DPS information doesn’t demonstrate the 3,000-plus homicides were committed by any residents since 2008. Rather, Walker said by phone, the presentation telescoped the arrest histories of the 203,685 individuals put in county jails in the 69 months that were reviewed. ""Where did they offend--Texas? Oklahoma? Mississippi?"" Walker said, his point being such information isn’t on the web page. Walker and Ramiro Martinez, Jr., a Northeastern University professor, each suggested it’s highly unlikely unauthorized residents committed that many homicides in the years mentioned by Perry. Drawing on FBI Uniform Crime Statistics for Texas posted online by the DPS, Walker calculated that from 2008 through 2012, there were 3,903 persons arrested on homicide charges in the state. Walker said it’s not logical that residents in the state without legal permission accounted for most of the same deaths. He conceded, too, he wasn’t able to roll in homicide charges from 2013 and 2014; he didn’t see that data online nor were we successful in eliciting figures from DPS. Martinez offered up his own analysis, which started by averaging the FBI’s tally of a little more than 1,100 homicides in Texas in 2011 and 2012 and extrapolating that over six years to reach an estimated total of nearly 6,700 homicides over most of the period analyzed by DPS. By email, Martinez said Perry’s statement to Beck potentially would suggest 3,070, or 46 percent, of the estimated homicides were committed by ""illegal aliens."" But, he said, ""that makes no sense."" He said in a follow-up email: ""It just boggles the imagination that level of ‘aliens’ were involved to that extent over time and nobody noticed."" The criminologists noted another weakness; the DPS presentation mixes together recent homicide charges with those that might have been leveled decades ago. Also, they noted, the agency tallied arrests only, not homicide convictions. Martinez also raised an eyebrow at the mingling of criminal charges against legally authorized U.S. residents and individuals in the country without permission, risking conclusions irrelevant to border security today. By the state's approach, he said, it’s possible a homicide charge in the tally involves someone who reached the U.S. from Cuba in 1962 who was later charged with and/or committed a homicide. If so, he said, that charge would bear no relevance to criminal actions by people lately crossing the Rio Grande. Neither the DPS or Perry’s office offered more information. Our ruling Perry told Beck over 3,000 homicides were committed ""by illegal aliens over the"" last six years. This claim is unsupported by the presentation he relied on, which indicates that since 2008 in Texas, more than 200,000 arrested immigrants -- foreign nationals living here with or without legal permission -- had among them accumulated 3,070 homicide charges (not convictions) in their lives. Put another way, for this declaration to hold water, one would have to assume illegal immigrants committed nearly half of the state’s homicides since 2008; we found no such data.

Barack Obama says U.S. has recovered from recession better than almost every advanced country
","While his critics decry his economic policies, President Barack Obama keeps insisting that he’s had economic success. In a speech in Wilmington, Del., last week, Obama offered several pieces of evidence that, in his view, suggests that the country is rebounding from the recession. Unemployment is at its lowest rate since 2008, he noted; the auto industry is ""booming,"" America is making more oil than it imports, and the deficit has been cut in half, he added. All told, Obama said, ""we’ve recovered faster and come farther than almost any other advanced country on Earth."" That final claim got our attention, so we took a closer look. The evidence We asked the White House for evidence to back up Obama’s claim, and they pointed us to their annual economic report to Congress. According to the report, the United States is ""one of only two of the 12 countries that experienced systemic financial crises in 2007 and 2008 but have seen real (gross domestic product) per working-age person return to pre-crisis levels."" The 12 countries are France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom and United States. Germany is the only other country of these 12 in that category -- that is, that has seen its GDP per person age 16 to 64 return to its pre-recession level. Here’s the summary chart from the White House report:      This provides evidence for Obama’s claim, because, aside from Germany, all the other countries in this category haven’t yet returned to their pre-recession level at all. So, case closed? Not quite. There are many ways to measure the economy beyond real GDP per working age. And while the 12 countries studied in the report all experienced bank crises during the recession, Obama’s statement was broader than that -- he said ""almost any other advanced country on Earth."" (The list of the most ""advanced countries on Earth"" also usually doesn’t include Ukraine.) So we ran this measurement past some experts. In general, they agreed with the tenor of Obama’s claim, but said it wasn’t as simple as relying on the chart the White House provided. ""The general sentiment is quite right,"" said Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at Harvard University. ""But to evaluate the statement in its sweeping form, one would have to look at more countries, and one should look at other possible measures of economic performance."" Additional measurements On the experts’ recommendations, we looked at inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, as well as unemployment rates, in a wider selection of advanced countries. We used data from the International Monetary Fund, which considers 36 economies to be ""advanced."" For each of these 36 countries, we calculated the growth between their worst point in GDP and unemployment to 2013, the last year for which full data is available. Positive growth in GDP is good, while negative growth in unemployment is desirable. Each value that is better than the United States’ (the last country on the list) is highlighted in bold-italic. (The raw data is here.)   Country GDP Unemploym. Country GDP Unemploym. Australia 13.01% 1.49% Korea 15.98% -16.11% Austria 5.93% 2.45% Latvia 15.36% -36.44% Belgium 4.25% 1.82% Luxembourg 6.93% 17.72% Canada 9.96% -14.58% Malta 8.57% -6.14% Cyprus -6.66% 155.94% Netherlands 0.39% 54.15% Czech Republic 2.37% -4.48% New Zealand 9.18% -6.22% Denmark 2.55% -6.25% Norway 5.30% -2.26% Estonia 17.76% -48.36% Portugal -3.90% 50.52% Finland 3.76% -2.87% San Marino -15.98% 61.78% France 4.08% 11.14% Singapore 29.34% -37.19% Germany 8.93% -32.12% Slovak Republic 10.51% -2.20% Greece -16.92% 117.47% Slovenia -1.72% 39.40% Hong Kong 16.96% -40.30% Spain -2.79% 31.38% Iceland 7.10% -45.41% Sweden 12.39% -6.71% Ireland 1.98% -5.83% Switzerland 7.98% -14.67% Israel 19.48% -32.10% Taiwan   19.58% -28.55% Italy -2.09% 45.31% United Kingdom 4.86% -3.13% Japan 7.31% -20.30% United States 9.32% -23.64%   So the United States has clearly done better in expanding GDP and lowering unemployment than most of the economies deemed ""advanced"" by the IMF. Still, some countries have fared better, particularly in Asia. It is also worth nothing that some countries, like Estonia, have seen an improvement in GDP, yet their GDP has not yet returned to pre-recession levels. Among the countries beyond the United States that are doing well are Canada, Germany and Switzerland. Israel and some Asian countries, such as Korea and Singapore, have seen improvements as good or better than the United States' in recent years, but they were not as dramatically affected by the recession as North America and Europe. Austan Goolsbee, Obama’s former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers (which prepares the White House’s annual economic report), pointed to an IMF paper from April, ""World Economic Outlook: Recovery Strengthens, Remains Uneven."" Overall, the report suggests that the United States’ forecast for economic growth is better than it is for many advanced European economies, with others roughly comparable. In general, the United States is expected to have the highest growth in the coming year -- a projected 2.75 percent. In fact, the report found that the United States economy accelerated faster than anticipated in 2013, while many advanced economies in Europe are still struggling with high unemployment, debt and other financial issues. Canada, too, has seen some growth, but sluggish exports and business investments have kept the growth fairly slow. ""The strengthening of the recovery from the Great Recession in the advanced economies is a welcome development,"" the report says. ""But growth is not evenly robust across the globe."" In many advanced Asian economies, for instance, the recovery is steady due in large part to growing exports, domestic demand and strong labor markets. (Japan, which is undergoing structural reforms, is an exception.) Australia and New Zealand -- neither of which was included in the report the White House cited -- have growth classified as ""stable."" Laurence Ball, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, said another factor to consider is the long-term damage caused by the recession. Ball looked at 23 countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and compared how much they thought they could grow in 2007 to how much they think they can grow now, based on OECD estimates. Ball found that, on average, these countries sustained an 8.3 percent blow to their potential output for growth. While some countries, Australia and Switzerland, took a very small hit to their potential output, Greece, Hungary and Ireland absorbed blows of roughly 30 percent compared to their GDP prospects before the recession. For the United States, the figure is 5.3 percent -- lower than the rate for most advanced countries, but higher than Australia, Switzerland and Germany. This shows that even though the United States has recovered well compared to other countries, it has still lost potential output as a result of the recession, Ball said. Our ruling Obama said the United States has ""recovered faster and come farther than almost any other advanced country on Earth"" since the end of the Great Recession. The White House’s supporting data is pretty narrow, but other measurements show that the United States has generally fared better since the recession than many -- though not all -- of its peers among the world’s advanced economies.

Dobbs: Obama policy on young immigrants 'created' the crisis at the border
","One of the consistent talking points among conservatives discussing the thousands of kids arriving at the U.S. border is that President Barack Obama’s 2012 immigration policy is responsible. The policy allowed certain young people without legal status to apply for a two-year deferral of any removal proceedings. Though it does not apply to people just now crossing the border, conservatives say it gave children and their families the idea that they could try. And so they have. We’ve heard that thinking from former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Republican strategist Karl Rove and now, Fox Business News host Lou Dobbs.  ""This president and his administration knew what was happening with the issuance of the executive order in 2012, which created these children coming across,"" Dobbs said on July 21, 2014. There is a problem with the claim, however. The dates don’t line up as neatly as people are letting on. The deferred action policy In June 2012, about four months before the presidential election, the Obama administration issued a memo saying it would allow certain young people without legal immigration status to apply for a two-year deferral of any removal proceedings. That deferral could be extended and anyone who was accepted would also gain the ability to work in this country. Generally speaking, it targeted people who had come across the border with their parents when they were little and had lived in the United States for many years. The move came after Republicans rejected a bill, the DREAM Act, that would have put these immigrants on a path to citizenship. To qualify, people had to show that they came to the country before they were 16, had lived here continuously since 2007, had never been convicted of a crime, were age 30 or under, and were either in school or had at least a high school education or had served in the armed forces. The government began accepting applications in mid August. Tracking the rise of children coming to the border The Congressional Research Service is a nonpartisan body that delivers policy research for Congress. In a June 2014 report, analysts included a chart showing how many new children had been handed over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Under a 2008 law aimed at protecting young victims of human trafficking, this is the agency responsible for taking care of unaccompanied minors apprehended by U.S. border or immigration agents. The chart measured the number of children processed by month, so we can get a better picture of how things played out along the border. The numbers don’t include children stopped at the border and immediately sent back, but they do mirror the overall trends.  As you can see, monthly referrals largely were steady between October 2008 and January 2012. They then started to rise between January and April 2012, months before Obama announced his executive action. After that, they plateaued until January 2013, when they grew exponentially. Based on this chart, the rate of arrivals nearly doubled before Obama announced his new policy. Overall, there is not a simple cause and effect relationship that Obama issued his policy and arrivals went up. But this isn’t to say that Obama’s policy played no role in the current flood of children arriving at the border. The administration tacitly acknowledges some relationship. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson published an open letter in key Central American countries in which he made the point that the new policy would not apply to children who show up today. ""A child must have been in the United States prior to June 15, 2007 – seven years ago,"" Johnson wrote. In a report on the causes behind the current crisis, congressional researchers said many factors are driving the flood of children at the border. Those fleeing El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras account for most of the influx. Those countries suffer from high rates of crime and poor economies. Surveys found that about half of the children had been harmed or threatened by gangs or agents of the state. Children did not tend to come from Central American countries with less crime and better economies.  The same surveys found that many of  the children sought to join family members already living in the United States. The 2008 revised trafficking law is another potential factor. It opened a new legal option for unaccompanied children from countries other than Mexico and Canada. They can apply for asylum on the grounds that if they were sent home, they have good reason to fear that they would face persecution. It is unclear if fear of gang-violence meets that condition. Nevertheless, the children are getting a hearing and while they wait for the process to play itself out, they remain in this country.  Our ruling Dobbs said the Obama policy directed at younger immigrants created the the problem at the border. The initial rise in arrivals began before Obama announced the policy and if anything, plateaued or declined a bit immediately afterward. However, the administration went out of its way recently to send the message that the policy did not apply to newcomers, suggesting the policy played some role. The influx of children comes mainly from the most troubled nations in Central America. The claim that Obama’s policy created the influx does not match the timeline and ignores other important factors. We rate the claim Mostly False.","[('Fox News, Lou Dobbs Tonight, July 21, 2014', 'https://video.foxnews.com/v/3689792731001/white-house-unwilling-to-back-up-threats-against-vladimir-putin/?playlist_id=164630'), ('U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Deferred action memo, June 15, 2014', 'No link'), ('Brookings, DACA Renewals Ramp Up, July 8, 2014', 'http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf'), ('Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, Unaccompanied migrant children in the United States: Research roundup, July 22, 2014', 'No link'), ('Congressional Research Service, Unaccompanied Alien Children: Potential \xa0Factors Contributing to Recent Immigration, July 3, 2014', 'https://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2014/07/08-daca-renewals-ramp-up-svajlenka-singer'), ('Congressional Research Service, Unaccompanied Alien Children: An Overview, June 23, 2014', 'No link'), ('Fox News, Fox News Sunday, July 13, 2014', 'http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/immigration/unaccompanied-migrant-children-united-states-research-roundup?utm_source=JR-email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=JR-email'), ('Homeland Security Department, An Open Letter to the Parents of Children Crossing Our Southwest Border, June 23, 2014', 'No link'), ('Migration Policy Institute, Dramatic Surge in the Arrival of Unaccompanied Children Has Deep Roots and No Simple Solutions, June 13, 2014', 'http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/229368.pdf')]",/factchecks/2014/jul/23/lou-dobbs/dobbs-obama-policy-young-immigrants-created-crisis/

Nan Rich says tourism and retirees dominate Florida's economy
","Florida is famous for its tourists and retirees. They spend plenty of bucks in the Sunshine State -- but is the state reliant on them for its economic strength? Former state Sen. Nan Rich, the underdog who’s challenging former Gov. Charlie Crist in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, touched on that topic during a speech to the Florida Press Association in Coral Gables on July 11, 2014. (Crist spoke a day earlier; Republican Gov. Rick Scott declined an invitation to speak.) ""Our state’s economy is unlike any other in the country,"" Rich told the association, according to Miami Herald reporter David Smiley who attended the speech. ""Today, tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engines in our state. And while they do create jobs, they are mostly lower-paying service industry jobs."" Since the economy is a top issue in the battle for governor, we decided to check her statement that tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engines in Florida. A look at the data We found no cut-and-dried answers to the question of which sectors are Florida’s dominant economic engines. However, we did find evidence that shows tourism and retirees play an important role in the state’s economy -- too important, some say. Rich told PolitiFact Florida that she was relying on a 2014 report by the LeRoy Collins Institute, a public-policy group at Florida State University, titled, ""Tougher Choices: Shaping Florida’s Future."" It was written by professors Jim Dewey and David Denslow with the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Florida. The report examines state spending, demographics and jobs. Among the conclusions is that ""Florida’s reliance on retirees and tourists comes at a price as the demands of older residents and tourists are disproportionately linked to lower-paid service jobs. … Compared to the rest of the nation, Florida has relatively fewer high-skill high-wage jobs and relatively more low-skill low-wage jobs, many serving tourists and retirees."" Without the negative spin, the state’s official 2013 economic development plan concurs on the importance of tourism and population growth, which has traditionally been driven by retirees. ""Historically, Florida’s economy has been driven by agriculture, tourism, the military, and population growth, which in turn produced gains in construction, real estate, retail trade, and services,"" the plan says. About 19 percent of Florida’s population was at least 65 years old as of 2013, according to the U.S. Census. Bureau. Florida had the highest percentage of seniors in the nation as of 2010. We turned to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis to look at real gross domestic product by industry in the state of Florida -- the total amount of economic activity by sector, adjusted for inflation. Unfortunately, the data does not include ""tourism"" or ""retirees"" as an industry. One category that combines arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food service -- a rough approximation of ""tourism"" -- produced $46.9 billion in GDP in 2012. That was substantially smaller than the state’s biggest generator of GDP -- ""finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing,"" at $161.8 billion. But the latter category also includes some sectors relevant to Rich’s claim, such as real estate purchased by retirees. Other categories that exceeded the arts and entertainment sector included professional services, education and health care, and government. Some of these also generate economic activity due to seniors, particularly health care. The actual answer, apparently, appears to be more of an assumption than a provable fact. A Visit Florida spokeswoman told PolitiFact Florida that tourism is ""the state’s No. 1 industry"" and generates 23 percent of the state’s sales tax revenue and employs about 1.1 million Floridians. However, when we asked what economic measures prove that tourism is the top industry, Visit Florida spokeswoman Kathy Torian said: ""It's an aspirational statement rather than a scientific fact. ... We feel that the combination of sales tax revenue, employment and economic impact from visitor spending make the case for the tourism industry."" Experts' views We also interviewed four economists who study the state’s economy, and they generally agreed that tourism and retirees play a vital role in Florida’s economy, though with some quibbles. Bill Seyfried, an economist at Rollins College, said he’d prefer the term ""important engines"" rather than ""dominant."" ""Clearly, both tourism and retirees have strong impacts on the Florida economy -- more than most other states -- but the state economy is becoming more diversified as evidence by deeper integration with the global economy, which is likely to get a further boost with the expansion of the Panama Canal, as well as increased growth in professional/technical services, growing aerospace and life-science sectors,"" he said. Seyfried examined state GDP data from 2011-2013 and found that growth came from ""many sectors, not dominated by a few related to tourism. One can question whether some of the growth from 2011-2013 reflects a rebound from the crash, but the growth across sectors suggests a lack of overdependence on a few factors,"" such as tourism and retirees. Kwame Donaldson, an economist at Moody’s, told PolitiFact Florida that the state’s large senior population influences many other aspects of the state’s economy. ""Because of Florida’s large retiree population, its residents are more dependent on nonwage income than in any other state, which means that long periods of stock market gains (like the one we currently enjoying) provide an extra charge to Florida’s economy,"" Donaldson said. ""In many, many ways, Florida’s economy depends on its senior population, so I think it is accurate to describe this population as an economic engine."" Our ruling Rich said, ""tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engines in our state."" We didn’t find a simple way to quantify whether tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engine in Florida, but a combination of statistical data and expert analysis suggests that both are important engines, and possibly too important, due to the low-wage jobs they bring. We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('LeRoy Collins institute, ""Tougher Choices: Shaping Florida’s Future"" February 2014', 'http://collinsinstitute.fsu.edu/sites/collinsinstitute.fsu.edu/files/Tougher%20Choices%20FINAL%202-20-14.pdf'), ('Naked Politics, \xa0""News is grim in report by Collins Institute and UF,"" Feb. 20, 2014', 'No link'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""Nan Rich rips Charlie Crist for not debating,"" July 11, 2014', 'http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2014/02/news-is-grim-in-report-by-collins-institute-and-uf-.html'), ('U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Regional data GDP, 2012', 'No link'), ('Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, Florida Strategic Plan for Economic Development, 2013', 'http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/democrat-nan-rich-calls-on-charlie-crist-to-debate/2188126'), ('Visit Florida, Annual report, 2013', 'No link'), ('Visit Florida, Research about tourism spending, Accessed July 11, 2014', 'http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=70&step=1&isuri=1&acrdn=1#reqid=70&step=1&isuri=1&7003=900&7004=naics&7035=-1&7005=-1,77,79&7006=12000&7001=1900&7036=-1&7002=1&7090=70&7007=2012&7093=levels'), ('Palm Beach Post, ""Nan Rich rips Charlie Crist’s credentials but says she’ll support him if he wins primary,"" July 11, 2014', 'No link'), ('Interview, Nan Rich, Democratic primary candidate for governor and former state senator, July 11, 2014', 'http://sitefinity.floridajobs.org/Business/FL5yrPlan/FL_5yrEcoPlan.pdf'), ('Interview, Kathy Torian, Visit Florida spokeswoman, July 11, 2014', 'No link'), ('Interview, David Denslow, retired University of Florida economist, July 11, 2014', 'http://www.floridajobs.org/about%20awi/open_government/2013_VISITFloridaAnnualReport.pdf'), ('Interview, Bill Seyfried, Rollins College economist, July 11, 2014', 'No link'), ('Interview, Jessica Sims, Florida Department of Economic Opportunity spokeswoman, July 11, 2014', 'http://www.visitfloridamediablog.com/home/florida-facts/research/'), ('Interview, Kwame Donaldson, Moody’s economist, July 11, 2014', 'No link'), (""Interview, Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness, July 21, 2014"", 'http://postonpolitics.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2014/07/11/nan-rich-rips-charlie-crists-democratic-credentials-but-says-shell-support-him-if-he-wins-primary/')]",/factchecks/2014/jul/23/nan-rich/nan-rich-says-tourism-and-retirees-dominate-florid/

Mitch McConnell claims 'devastating' tax increase on middle class looming due to health care law
","Coal and health care are the two dominant themes in Kentucky’s hotly contested U.S. Senate race. Sen. Mitch McConnell’s campaign saw an opportunity to attack his Democratic opponent, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, on the second issue after a new report came out on the country’s long-term fiscal health. ""Alison Lundergan Grimes fully supports the implementation of Obamacare and the devastating tax hikes it will have on middle-class Kentuckians,"" McConnell spokeswoman Allison Moore said in a press release on July 17. The press release included several links to and excerpts from a July 16 Politico story about a new report from the Congressional Budget Office. The campaign said the story was ""background information highlighting"" how ""Obamacare implementation will hurt middle-class Kentuckians."" So clearly, McConnell’s statement is linked to the findings in this study. But did this study show ""devastating tax hikes"" are on the horizon for Kentucky’s middle class? Let’s take a look. The study The Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ top fiscal scorekeeper, released a report in July on the country’s long-term budget outlook. It raises concerns about the country’s current financial path if the status quo is maintained for the next 25 years, including about the country’s debt. The report also looked at the country’s tax policy. One interesting line mentioned the future impact of taxes — including some in the Affordable Care Act. ""Because some parameters of the tax system are not indexed to increase with inflation, rising prices alone push a greater share of income into higher tax brackets,"" the report says. What does this mean? Basically, some federal taxes kick in when you reach a certain income level. These levels are not set to increase with inflation. So in 25 years, inflation will push some people past the threshold who, in today’s dollars, would not be required to pay those taxes. Summing this up, Politico headline is ""CBO: Everyone’s taxes will go up quietly."" But as you’ll see, the effect of the Affordable Care Act is much more limited than other parts of the tax code. The Affordable Care Act and taxes There are a couple tax levels in the Affordable Care Act that are not indexed to inflation, and therefore, over time, some people who were not paying this tax will, unless Congress makes some changes. One is a levy on investment income for individuals who earn more than $200,000 a year. It also applies to families with incomes beyond $250,000. You’ll notice right away that’s a pretty high watermark. A salary of $200,000 today would put an individual in about the top 5 percent of all income earners in the United States, according to the Tax Policy Center, an independent think tank. Clearly, that’s not middle class. But let’s play ball with McConnell and peek ahead 25 years down the road, shall we? According to the CBO report, the median total income in 2039 will be $50,900, well below the $200,000 level to qualify. For a family of four with two parents and two children, median income will be about $146,000. Higher, but still $100,000 short of the $250,000 threshold for families. Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center provided us some additional projections. By his estimates, in 2039, someone making $205,000 would be among the top 20 percent of all earners. While middle class is a loosely defined term, ""you wouldn’t say top 20 percent is middle class,"" Williams said. ""In that sense, even there, these taxes are not likely to hit very many people in the middle class, if anybody,"" Williams said. That’s especially true in Kentucky, a state with the fourth-lowest median income in the country. In 2018, the Affordable Care Act also phases in an excise tax on the so-called ""Cadillac"" or high-cost health insurance policies. The premiums for these plans are paid for almost entirely by employers, and often offer generous benefits and little cost-sharing for employees. Under Obamacare, plans that cost more than $10,200 are subject to a 40 percent tax, but only on the amount that exceeds $10,200. (Meaning if a plan costs $11,000, the insurance provider will pay taxes on $800 of it.) Those costs are likely to be passed on to employers, the CBO said. In 2009, Sarah Palin said this tax would hit those making under $200,000 the hardest. We said that was Mostly True. At the time, however, the Affordable Care Act was still working its way through Congress and the unfinished bill taxed policies exceeding $8,000, significantly less than the final outcome. Even then, analysts said it was only expected to affect about one-in-four insurance policies in 2019. (We couldn’t find any studies that analyzed this tax in the form it was signed into law.) It would be a stretch to call this tax ""devastating."" The CBO said the vast majority of employers are more likely to offer workers less expensive plans than pay the higher costs. However, the CBO and other economists said wages will increase to make up for the lost health benefits (which is a form of compensation). So those workers may pay some higher taxes on the increased income and see changes to their health care plans, but they’ll make more money as well. One study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said that the increase in wages would far surpass additional taxes collected by the government. That is based on taxing at $8,000, not $10,200, but the general concept still holds, said Steve Zuckerman, a senior fellow in the Health Policy Center of the Urban Institute. ""It’s a tradeoff in compensation and slightly less generous fringe benefits,"" Zuckerman said. ""It doesn’t seem to me it’s going to be a devastating tax increase. If anything, on balance, they’ll be paying more taxes ... but they’ll also have more take-home pay."" We took all of this to Moore, McConnell’s spokeswoman. In addition to arguing that the taxes mentioned above would, over time, affect the middle class, she also pointed out that the individual mandate requiring almost all uninsured Americans to buy insurance should be considered a tax on the middle class. In upholding the law, the Supreme Court said the mandate ""may reasonably be characterized as a tax"" when it upheld the law. But this is not what was highlighted by the CBO report or the Politico story the campaign cited.   Our ruling On the news of a new CBO report, a McConnell spokeswoman said that the implementation of Obamacare as outlined in the report would mean ""devastating tax hikes ... on middle-class Kentuckians."" Mostly, this report showed how more high-income earners will have to pay taxes over time, but most of the middle class wouldn’t be affected, even 25 years from now. The exception is the excise tax on high-cost plans. While just a fraction of plans would be affected, there are plenty of regular folks who have these types of policies. Still, they’re not likely to face ""devastating"" tax increases. It’s more probable that employers will provide less expensive insurance policies. Those employees will subsequently pay more in taxes, but only because their incomes will increase. We rate the claim from McConnell’s campaign as Mostly False.","[('Press release from Sen.

Pat Buchanan: 'Right now, one third of all illegal aliens are going to California'
","The Golden State went from red to blue thanks to an influx of immigrants, which is a cautionary tale for the national conservative agenda, says GOP pundit Pat Buchanan. On July 17, 2014, on Fox’s The Sean Hannity Show, Buchanan noted that California Republicans are now outnumbered 2 to 1 in the state Legislature, 2 to 1 one in Congress, and that no Republican holds a statewide office. ""Right now, one third of all the illegal aliens go to California. Take a look at California politically, which Richard Nixon carried five times and Ronald Reagan carried in four landslides,"" he said. ""And when the country looks like California demographically, it’s gonna look like California politically."" We wanted to check Buchanan’s claim that a third of the country’s unauthorized immigrants are Cali-bound. To the redwood forests  Buchanan did not respond when we asked where he got his numbers, so we can’t know for sure. There’s really no good data on immediate destinations -- where unauthorized immigrants are going initially -- according to Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at the Pew Research Center. He said that though immigrants are more mobile than native-born residents, the general trend is that fewer immigrants are going to California first. There’s also no way to know exactly how many unauthorized immigrants reside in the United States, wrote Kevin Johnson, the dean of public interest law at the University of California-Davis. Most reports and experts agree that the number is somewhere between 11 and 12 million. So based on the estimates we have, where are unauthorized immigrants living? In 2012, the Department of Homeland Security reported that 25 percent of unauthorized immigrants live in California. Texas came in second with 16 percent. The estimates rely on U.S. Census Bureau data, which attempts to measure everyone living in the country, measured against data on legal immigrants from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State. The Department of Homeland Security warns in its report that its state-to-state estimates may be affected by state-to-state migration (i.e. someone lives in California at the time of the Census but moved elsewhere later). Another report, from Pew, has a slightly lower estimate. In 2013, Pew reported that 21 percent of the nation’s unauthorized immigrants lived in California, a rate that Pew says has held steady since 2010. That’s a sharp decline from 1990, when Pew said that 42 percent of all unauthorized immigrants lived in California. Texas came in second in this report as well, at 14.5 percent. Both these reports, we should note, measure where unauthorized immigrants are living. Buchanan said they are ""going"" there after crossing the border. ""Maybe, I’m speculating here, (Buchanan’s number) can refer to the immigrants first going into California and then moving to other states? I haven’t seen any reports that suggest that though. So most likely, he’s speaking out of his butt,""  said Manuel Pastor, co-director of the University of Southern California’s Center for the Study of Immigration Integration. While California is taking in more unauthorized immigrants than other states, its share has been dropping, experts say. Passel said this is because of the state’s recession in the mid 1990s, which led to immigrants seeking jobs in ""new destination areas"" such as Texas. Historically, because immigrants are attracted to the United States for employment opportunities, the Golden State has always been a top choice, especially for unauthorized immigrants seeking niche labor opportunities. ""California has a large economy with many jobs, including the agricultural, construction, and service industries, which have attracted undocumented workers,"" Johnson said. In addition to geographic proximity, the rise of the service sector and low-wage manufacturing in the 1980s and 1990s made Los Angeles a mecca for immigrants, Pastor said. And since most immigration is ""chain immigration,"" immigrants tend to head for California. ""Their families are already there. Their friends are there,"" Pastor said. ""Many undocumented immigrants have been in America longer than 10 years. There’s a tendency to think this is a shallowly rooted population. But these immigrants are deeply immersed in their communities."" Party lines Though not specifically part of this fact-check, it’s important to note that Buchanan is mixing apples and oranges when he suggests unauthorized immigrants are directly affecting election outcomes. Unauthorized immigrants cannot vote. Neither can legal immigrants until they are naturalized. And there are almost no reports in California of unlawful voting by noncitizens, according to Johnson. ""California’s racial ethnic makeup has certainly changed. But still, a lot of its legal immigrants aren’t citizens, let alone unauthorized immigrants,"" said Passel. The one situation that most directly could affect an election would be if two unauthorized parents have a child in the United States. That child would be a legal U.S. citizen and would be eligible to vote when they turn 18. On politics, it’s hard to see a direct correlation simply between the number of unauthorized immigrants and election results. California voted Republican for president from 1968-88 and has voted Democrat from 1992-2012. Of the state’s last six elected governors, three were Republican and three were Democrat. In Texas, which has the second-highest share of unauthorized immigrants, Republicans have won the last nine presidential elections and served as governor for 27 out of the past 35 years. The ruling Buchanan said, ""Right now, one third of all illegal aliens are going to California."" While experts say no good account for initial destinations of unauthorized immigrants exists, the most reliable estimates of unauthorized immigrants living in California range between 21 and 25 percent. That’s a bit lower than what Buchanan said. As a result, we rate his claim Half True.","[('Interview with Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Research Center, July 22, 2014', 'http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/immigration/2013/03/californias-undocumented-immigrants.html'), ('Interview with Manuel Pastor, co-director of the University of Southern California’s Center for the Study of Immigration Integration, July 21, 2014', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Kevin Johnson, dean of public interest law at the University of California Davis, July 21-22, 2014', 'https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ois_ill_pe_2012_2.pdf'), ('Email interview with Hans Johnson, immigration expert at the Public Policy Institute of California, July 22, 2014', 'No link'), ('Law Professors Blogs Network, California’s Undocumented Immigrants, March 7, 2013', 'http://www.pewhispanic.org/2013/09/23/3-state-patterns/'), ('Department of Homeland Security, Estimates of the Unauthorized \xa0Immigrant Population Residing in \xa0the United States: January 2012, March 2013', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2014/jul/23/pat-buchanan/pat-buchanan-right-now-one-third-all-illegal-alien/

Sen. John Thrasher says E-Verify could've prevented 9/11 attacks
","
Republican Sen. John Thrasher came to the state Senate floor on May 3, 2011, to try to put teeth back into a watered-down immigration bill.

The bill -- which has been one of the more controversial of the 2011 legislative session -- had been stripped of a requirement that private employers use the federal E-Verify system to check a worker's immigration status. Rather than try to restore the mandate, Thrasher instead tried to offer employers a strong incentive to voluntarily use the system.

Use it, or risk being fined.

Thrasher's amendment would have created noncriminal fines for employers who are found to have employed a nondocumented worker and had not screened that employee through the E-Verify system. Thrasher explained that the employer would receive fines escalating from $500 to $1,500 for multiple instances of hiring illegal workers.

Several Republicans opposed the amendment, which ultimately failed 23-16, but not before Thrasher tried to sway votes by saying E-Verify could have prevented the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

During his closing argument, Thrasher reminded people that the United States had -- after 10 years and millions and millions of dollars -- found and killed 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden on May 1, 2011.

""I want to remind everyone in here that 10 of the 19 terrorists who attacked our country, directed by Osama bin Laden in doing that, lived in the state of Florida,"" Thrasher said. ""I wish we would have had the E-Verify system. ... We might have saved the lives of 3,000 Americans.

Matt Dixon of the Florida Times-Union spoke with Thrasher after his comments and asked for him to clarify his statement. Thrasher said that ""several of them (the hijackers) had jobs,"" and might have been flagged by the E-Verify system. He also said that an earlier version of the bill had stronger requirements for law enforcement officials to use E-Verify and might have helped catch the 9/11 plotters. 
A staggering claim about E-Verify and 9/11. But true?

First, the E-Verify system is a federal database that compares information from a person's employment paperwork to the Department of Homeland Security and Social Security records. Employers use the program to weed out immigrants not eligible to work in this country. Once employers hire workers, they run their names through the E-Verify database. If the records match, the new employees are eligible to work. If they don't match, the database notifies the employers, who must then give the workers eight days to provide sufficient proof of eligibility.

A pilot program of what is now the E-Verify system launched in 1997 in several states -- including Florida -- and the program expanded to all 50 states by 2004. In 2004, 3,500 employers were authorized the system. More than 200,000 employers are now registered to use E-Verify.

As for the 9/11 terrorists, Thrasher actually understates the connection to Florida. At least 14 of the 19 hijackers either spent time in Florida, or had Florida driver's licenses or identification cards. Among the people living in Florida were Mohammed Atta, who piloted American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston into the World Trade Center's north tower; Marwan al-Shehhi, who piloted United Airlines Flight 175 from Boston into the World Trade Center's south tower; and Ziad Samir Jarwan, the pilot of United Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania.

The three pilots received their pilot training in Florida.

The question here, however, is if any of the hijackers could have been flagged by the E-Verify system. In order to do that, they would have needed to try to get a job.

Other than one hijacker, Hani Hanjour, the 9/11 conspirators entered the United States legally by obtaining tourist visas. Hanjour used a student visa. It's important when considering Thrasher's claim because people entering the country on tourist visas are not allowed to work for U.S. employers. E-Verify or no E-Verify.

And the majority of the hijackers, 13 of the 19, entered the country in the spring or summer of 2001, just months before the Sept. 11 attack.

That means most of the hijackers would have been here for just a few months. Logic suggests they wouldn't have needed jobs.

And in fact, they did not. The 9/11 Commission, the group formed to better understand the plot and how it could have been prevented, reported that the plotters spent somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and conduct their attack, and that the money came directly from al-Qaida operatives. The commission concluded al-Qaida provided the hijackers ""with nearly all of the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live."" The money arrived either through wire transfers or cash, the commission concluded.

Of all of the hijackers, there is evidence that only one actually worked for a U.S. employer.

Nawaf Al-Hazmi, a hijacker on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon, did work at a San Diego-area Texaco station and car wash for about a month in early 2000. Al-Hazmi worked at minimum wage two days a week, vacuuming and drying cars, the Washington Post reported. Al-Hazmi's employment is corroborated in the 9/11 Commission's findings.

Al-Hazmi was in the country on an expired tourist visa.

And he is one of the hijackers with a Florida connection. Al-Hazmi obtained a Florida driver's license on June 25, 2001, in Palm Beach County.

But that was more than a year after he worked briefly at the California gas station.

To recap, Thrasher said: ""I want to remind everyone in here that 10 of the 19 terrorists who attacked our country, directed by Osama bin Laden in doing that, lived in the state of Florida. I wish we would have had the E-Verify system ... we might have saved the lives of 3,000 Americans.""

Hijackers did live in Florida and obtain Florida driver's licenses. But in order to potentially be flagged by the E-Verify system, they would have had to work in the state. There is no record that any of them ever tried to get jobs here. And as such, E-Verify -- had it been used by Florida employers as Thrasher wanted -- wouldn't have found them or stopped their plotting. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!","[('\nSen.

Terry McAuliffe says China owns $1.1 trillion in U.S. debt
","
At the height of Donald Trump-fueled birther fever, potential Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe stopped by MSNBC’s Hardball with Chris Matthews to chime in on ""The Donald.""

McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, received a $25,000 campaign contribution from Trump, a Republican, during his unsuccessful 2009 gubernatorial bid.

But on TV, McAuliffe was dismissive of his one-time benefactor’s claims that President Obama was born in Kenya. He said the birther sideshow -- which was discredited a few days later when Obama released his long-form U.S. birth certificate -- was hurting Republicans by scaring away undecided voters, and distracting people from important issues.  

""This is so offensive to independents and to people in this country today ... who worry that China now owns $1.1 trillion of our debt, our trade deficit last year with them was a quarter of a trillion dollars. They’re worried about their job. They’re worried about their children’s job. And this gibberish that they talk about on television is doing nothing and other countries are moving at warp speed ahead of us on renewable energy, wind, electric cars...""
 
OK, before McAuliffe starts plugging his electric car company, as he is wont, let’s take a look at those digits and dollar signs he’s throwing around.  

The $1.1 trillion sounded familiar, so we’ll examine that one first.

For a source, McAuliffe provided a March 1 article from Reuters. The second paragraph of that story supports his claim:

""Treasury Department data released on Monday showed that China held $1.16 trillion in U.S. government debt in December, the most recent month for which figures are available, up from prior estimates of $892 billion,"" the story says.

Well, that’s true. The latest figures from the U.S. Treasury Department show China held $1.154 trillion in U.S. debt in February -- down $600 million from January. Japan was the second-largest holder, at $890.3 billion, with Great Britain third at $295.5 billion.

Here’s a little background: The total federal debt, as of May 2, was $14.29 trillion. Of that amount, about $9.65 trillion is called public debt, which refers to all federal securities held by institutions and individuals outside the U.S. government. That includes China and other foreign nations.

The remaining debt -- about $4.64 trillion -- is held by the Federal Financing Bank, U.S. government trust funds, and other federal funds and accounts. The largest trust fund is the one that endows Social Security.  

McAuliffe, for his second claim,  used a report from the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution that reports: ""In 2010, the U.S.-China trade deficit increased to over $273 billion, the highest bilateral trade deficit on record. It represents almost 55 percent of the total U.S. trade deficit.""

We checked it out, and that’s true, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. If you’re curious, this year’s trade deficit through February was $42.1 billion. That’s almost 36 percent of the United States’ $117.8 billion trade deficit for the first two months of the year.

Looking back, this is an open-and-shut case.

We cannot confirm McAuliffe’s claim that independent voters are offended by The Donald. But he’s right on his numbers: China owns $1.1 trillion in U.S. debt; our trade deficit with China was about $275 billion last year.

Both scary, both True.","[('\nHardball with Chris Matthews, segment on Donald Trump, April 26, 2011.\n\nReuters, ""China seen as risk as holdings surpass $1 trillion,"" March 1, 2011.\n\nBrookings, ""The U.S. Trade Deficit, China and the Need to Rebalance Growth,"" Feb. 14, 2011.\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, Trade in Goods with China, accessed May 2, 2011.', 'http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036697/#42770358'), ('\nPolitiFact Virginia, Randy Forbes says the U.S. pays China $73.9 million per day in debt interest, April 26, 2011.', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2011/may/03/terry-mcauliffe/terry-mcauliffe-says-china-owns-11-trillion-us-deb/

Trump: U.S. doesn't build bridges anymore
","
Now that President Barack Obama has released his original Certificate of Birth, Donald Trump wants to talk about other things.

Like bridges. More specifically, that the United States isn't building them any more, while China is.

It has become a regular talking point for the real estate mogul/potential Republican presidential candidate in recent press appearances. Here are a couple examples:

""We are rebuilding China. I don't know if you know it. They're building bridges. They're building airports. They're building cities, brand-new cities. When was the last time you saw a bridge being built in the United States? We don't have bridges being built. We have bridges that are falling down."" - Trump on CNN's State of the Union on April 17, 2011.

 ""When was the last time – if you go to China, as an example – bridges being built, massive bridges. When is the last time we built a bridge in this country, other than a little toy."" - Trump at a press conference in New Hampshire on April 27, 2011.

Is the United States no longer in the bridge building game?

We contacted the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration to get data on federal spending on bridges over the last decade. The press office prepared a report on funds obligated for highway bridge replacement, rehabilitation and maintenance for the fiscal years 2001 through 2010. The report shows a steady upward trend in federal spending (in other words, not including state and local bridge funding): from $4.8 billion in 2001; to $6.8 billion in 2008; and then jumping to $9.4 billion and $8.5 billion in 2009 and 2010 as a result of an influx of money from the economic stimulus package.

It's not that the U.S. isn't spending more on bridges, said Jeffrey Solsby, a spokesman for the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. It's that it isn't nearly enough to keep pace. Over the last 30 years, the number of cars and miles driven has doubled, he said, yet the amount of road and bridge capacity has increased just 7 percent.

""We didn't build it, and they came anyway,"" Solsby said.

According to an April 28, 2011, story in The Economist, America is lagging behind most of the rest of the industrialized world in terms of investment in infrastructure such as bridges.

""Total public spending on transport and water infrastructure has fallen steadily since the 1960s and now stands at 2.4 percent of GDP,"" the story notes. ""Europe, by contrast, invests 5 percent of GDP in its infrastructure, while China is racing into the future at 9 percent. America’s spending as a share of GDP has not come close to European levels for over 50 years. Over that time funds for both capital investments and operations and maintenance have steadily dropped.""

Moreover, the article notes, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that ""America needs to spend $20 billion more a year just to maintain its infrastructure at the present, inadequate, levels."" And that's doesn't include building new bridges.

In its ""2010 Bridge Inventory"" report, Better Roads Magazine analyzed the state of the nation's more than 600,000 bridges and concluded that a ""worryingly high"" number of them are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. 

Politicians on both sides of the aisle acknowledge the problem, Solsby said. The dilemma is how to pay for it. States are financially strapped as a result of the recession. Federal dollars are stretched, too. The ARTBA would like to see an increase in the gasoline tax to fund more bridges, Solby said, but with gas prices soaring, ""Is that politically palatable?""

""From one perspective, he (Trump) is right,"" Solsby said. ""Everyone else on the planet realizes infrastructure investments are a major shot of adrenaline for an economy. But it's not like we are not building bridges. We are. It's just slow.""

Bridge experts we spoke with rattled off a number of major bridges recently completed or well underway. Among them:

* The Hoover Dam bypass bridge, which opened October, 2010. The New York Times called it ""an engineering marvel and an acrophobe's nightmare."" The 1,900-foot-long bridge over the Colorado River gorge, connecting Arizona and Nevada, is the the seventh-highest bridge in the world and the longest single-span concrete arch bridge in the Western hemisphere. In other words, not just a ""little toy.""

* The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, a ""major seismic retrofit"" with a total project length of 8.4 miles. Cost of the East Span alone is estimated at nearly $5.5 billion. It is projected to open in both directions in 2013.

* The replacement 1.1-mile Woodrow Wilson Bridge across the Potomac River, connecting Maryland and Virginia, which was completed in 2008 with a capacity for 295,000 vehicles a day. 

* The I-35W bridge over Mississippi River in Minneapolis, replacing the bridge that tragically collapsed in August 2007, claiming 13 lives. A new, 10-lane replacement bridge opened -- at a cost of $234 million -- just over a year later. 

* The Willis Avenue Bridge over the Harlem River connecting Manhattan and the Bronx in New York City. Completed last summer at a cost of $614 million, the 2,400-ton bridge span was shipped 136 miles via two barges.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, just a sampling. Which is all to say: the U.S. is still in the bridge-building business. So Trump has overreached with his claims. But allowing for the possibility that Trump was exercising a bit of hyperbole to make a point about needing to prioritize infrastructure investment for things like new bridges -- an issue that data suggests is a valid and pressing concern --  we rate Trump's statement Half True.","[('\nCNN, Transcript: State of the Union with Candy Crowley, Interview with Donald Trump, April 17, 2011\n\nU.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, Status of funds for highway bridge replacement, rehabilitation and maintenance, 2001-2010\n\nThe Economist, ""Life in the slow lane,"" April 28, 2011\n\nPalm Beach Post, ""Bridge over Tamiami Trail an Everglades milestone,"" by Jean Kress, Dec. 3, 2009\n\nBayBridgeInfo.org, The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Seismic Safety Projects\n\nNew York Times, ""In Nevada, the Viewing Has Begun From the Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge,"" by Henry Fountain, Jan. 28, 2011\n\nNew York Times, ""Come for the Highway.

Sen. J.D. Alexander questions E-Verify costs
","
The man running a controversial immigration bill through the Florida Senate says he opposes a requirement that employers use the federal E-Verify system to check the immigration status of their employees.

Sen. J.D. Alexander, R-Lake Wales, says he knows first-hand about the federal system -- since he uses it as a farmer and citrus grower. Alexander says E-Verify is flawed, and costly for business. The Senate is scheduled to debate the immigration bill, SB 2040, and the E-Verify component on May 3, 2011. Details of the entire bill remain unknown.

But Alexander has pretty much made his position known, saying he will try to remove any E-Verify requirement.

""It takes a while to really know the answer,"" he said of E-Verify. ""It has the potential of being wrong.""

And, he said, ""it's a fair amount of cost"" -- about $20 per person who isn't eligible to work. ""It's fairly expensive.""

Alexander noted to reporters that he's short about 100 people to pick a blueberry crop. ""For all the unemployment, there just are not folks who want to come out and pick blueberries,"" he said, for about $9 an hour.

As the debate continues, we wanted to touch on Alexander's concern about cost.

The E-Verify system is a federal database that compares information from a person's employment paperwork to Homeland Security and Social Security records. Employers who use the program can weed out immigrants not eligible to work in this country. Once employers hire workers, they run their names through the E-Verify database. If the records match, the new employees are eligible to work. If they don't match, the database notifies the employers, who must then give the workers eight days to provide sufficient proof of eligibility.

Critics like Alexander complain that the database is inaccurate and needs improvement.

More than a dozen states require the use of the system in one form or another, whether it's for state workers, state contractors, or for all or most all employers. In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott issued Executive Order 11-02 in his first hours in office requiring the use of the system for executive agency workers and state contractors. He has promised to extend that order to all state employers.

The system can be accessed at no charge -- meaning employers don't have to pay the federal government to use E-Verify.

But that doesn't mean Alexander is wrong in making his claim about the cost to businesses.

A Florida Senate analysis notes only that the mandatory use of E-Verify ""may have an economic impact on private employers."" Employers must either dedicate personnel to learn the system and perform the background checks, or hire third-party agents to do the work for employers.

In either scenario, there is a cost. 

The federal government performed a detailed regulatory analysis of the cost federal contractors would be expected to incur by using the E-Verify system. The analysis concluded, for instance, that it would take a human relations official about 10 minutes to register to use the system, and then another 1.4 hours for an HR employee and lawyer to review the E-Verify memorandum of understanding. The analysis includes the computer, Internet and printer costs, and found that it takes five minutes for someone to enter a worker's information into the E-Verify system, and an additional five minutes if that worker is required to provide photo identification.

There also is a cost associated should a worker dispute the E-Verify findings, according to the government analysis.

And finally, there is a replacement cost to find workers to take the place of those who cannot pass the E-Verify system.

In conclusion, the government found that the average direct cost to a contractor with 10 employees would be $1,254 in the initial year. For contractors with 50 employees, the average cost of participating in E-Verify would be $3,163 in the initial year. For a contractor with 100 employees, the cost would be $5,615. And for a contractor with 500 employees, the cost would be $24,422.

The costs would be less in subsequent years, the government found.

The ongoing cost for a 10-employee company would be $156 a year, $440 for a 50-employee company, $802 for a 100-employee company, and $3,261 for a 500-employee company.

Finally, we checked with Hunter Employment, a third-party vendor that performs E-Verify checks for workers in Arizona -- where E-Verify is required. Hunter charges $50 for a company to enroll to use its services and an annual fee of $25 thereafter. On top of that, Hunter charges a $7.50 fee for each employee verified by Hunter Employment through the E-Verify program. That would be on top of any personnel time incurred by the company to process the agreement with Hunter, as well as other miscellaneous costs.

Alexander said one of the reasons he doesn't support mandating E-Verify is because it has ""a fair amount of cost,"" about $20 per person that does not match. Our analysis shows that there is indeed a cost to using the system -- though it's technically free. First, the cost shouldn't necessarily be different if a person isn't verified by the system, except that an employer will incur additional costs to replace that prospective worker.

And second, while Alexander's figure of $20 per employer isn't too far out of line based on the statistics we've seen, the cost does depend on how many employees are being checked, and whether a business decides to process the E-Verify checks by themselves or through a third-party company. So, we rate this claim Mostly True.","[('\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, E-Verify Overview, accessed May 3, 2011\n\nSB 2040, accessed May 3, 2011\n\nSB 2040, staff analysis, April 9, 2011\n\nSt. Petersburg Times, ""On immigration, J.D.

Rep. Dan Boren says most domestic oil is produced by ""small independent"" companies
","
During an April 27, 2011, interview with Stuart Varney of Fox News, Rep. Dan Boren, D-Okla., argued against eliminating certain tax breaks for oil companies -- an idea that had gained support in recent weeks as gasoline prices soared nationwide.

Boren argued that the biggest financial pain from ending such tax breaks would be felt by smaller companies like those based in his oil-rich state.

The tax breaks, he said, ""go to small independent companies like we have in Oklahoma. Did you know a vast majority of the production in the United States comes from small independent oil and gas companies? And the new rigs that are … drilling right now in the United States, they are not the ExxonMobils of the world. They are the Devons, the Chesapeakes, and even smaller companies that are based in Oklahoma that are employing a lot of … Democrats (in) blue-collar jobs. And the president needs to understand that.""

We wondered whether ""small independent oil and gas companies"" actually account for ""a vast majority of the production in the United States.""

We turned to the Independent Petroleum Association of America, the trade group that represents independent oil and gas companies. They pointed us to a study the group commissioned from the consulting firm IHS Global Insight and released earlier this month.

The study compared the reach of the ""independent"" sector to the bigger firms in the industry. It defined independents as ""all North American operators in the lower 48 states and Alaska, excluding BG, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ENI, ExxonMobil, Hess, Marathon, Murphy, Occidental, Petrobras, Repsol, Shell, Statoil, and Total.""

Using the statistical tables provided, we calculated a few relevant percentages. We’ll summarize them here:

U.S. oil and gas production for 2010 (amount produced)
Onshore: Independents accounted for 72 percent of production
Offshore: Independents accounted for 42 percent of production
Total: Independents accounted for 67 percent of production

U.S. oil and gas production for 2010 (dollar value)
Onshore: Independents accounted for 70 percent of value
Offshore: Independents accounted for 37 percent of value
Total: Independents accounted for 62 percent of value

So independents accounted for between 62 percent and 67 percent of domestic oil and gas production in 2010. That’s a healthy majority, but we think Boren’s description of it as ""a vast majority"" is exaggerated.

There’s another factor to consider. Boren said he was referring to ""small independent oil and gas companies."" The statistics above certainly include some of those smaller companies, but it also includes some that aren’t so small.

These include the two that Boren specifically mentioned. Devon Energy Corp. reported $9.9 billion in total revenue and $4.6 billion in net income in 2010, while Chesapeake Energy Corp reported $9.4 billion total revenue in 2010 and $1.8 billion in net income.

Both companies are small compared to, say, ExxonMobil Corp ($105 billion in revenues, $9.3 billion in net income for 2010), but they’re hardly run out of someone’s basement. So we think the suggestion that those companies qualify as ""small independent oil and gas companies"" is misleading.

Ultimately, Boren makes a valid point that a majority of U.S. oil production comes not from the biggest multinational oil companies but from independent firms. Still, it’s not a ""vast majority,"" as he said, and some of the firms in the ""independent"" category -- including the two he cited by name -- are hardly what most people would consider ""small."" On balance, we rate Boren’s statement Half True.","[('\nDan Boren, interview on Fox News, April 27, 2011 (CQ subscribers only)\n\nIHS Global Insight, ""The Economic Contribution of the Onshore Independent Oil and Natural Gas Producers to the U.S."" (report prepared for the Independent Petroleum Association of America), April 2011\n\nE-mail interview with Frederick Lawrence, vice president of economics and international affairs at the Independent Petroleum Association of America, April 29, 2011', 'http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-3859120'), ('\nE-mail interview with Kyle Isakower, vice president of regulatory and economic policy at the American Petroleum Institute, April 29, 2011', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2011/may/03/dan-boren/rep-dan-boren-says-most-domestic-oil-produced-smal/

Max Nofziger says Austin City Council bereft of South Austinites
","
When Max Nofziger, a South Austin resident seeking to rejoin the Austin City Council, was asked whether the city should stop electing council members by citywide vote, he answered that he’d prefer a mix of members chosen at-large and from single-member districts.

Pitching his case, Nofziger is quoted in the just-published ""Voters Guide"" from the League of Women Voters of the Austin Area: ""Currently, there is no one from South Austin on the (Austin City) Council!""

We left a message for Nofziger, a council member from mid-1987 to mid-1996, then re-read a Jan. 23 Austin American-Statesman news article supporting his claim.

The story revealed Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell’s desire to seek a voter-approved reorganization of the council resulting in six members elected from regional districts plus two members and the mayor elected citywide.

Currently, the story said, ""three council members live in or near downtown, two live in East Austin, one lives in Hyde Park, and Leffingwell lives northwest."" And, the story continues: ""None lives south"" of the Colorado River, which separates South Austin from the rest of the city.

Next, we contacted Matt Curtis, the mayor’s communications director, who told us no one has moved since that article was published. Curtis said Leffingwell lives in the Balcones  Drive part of West Austin and among other council members, Sheryl Cole lives in Wilshire Woods, Laura Morrison resides in Old West Austin, Chris Riley is downtown, Randy Shade lives in Clarksville and Bill Spelman hails from Hyde Park. Council Member Mike Martinez told us he lives in the Senate Hills part of East Austin, but plans to move later this year to East 11th Street near Chicon.

Curtis said the latest South Austinites on the council, Betty Dunkerley and Jennifer Kim, finished their terms in June 2008.

As we closed this check, Nofziger called to say he’d originally heard from local activists that the council now lacks South Austin residents.

Gov. John Kasich claims state workers will get pay raises
","
Gov. John Kasich marked his 100th day in office with a news conference highlighting a long list of accomplishments. Among them were introduction of the ""Jobs Budget,"" as he called it, and passage of Senate Bill 5.

SB 5, described as ""collective bargaining reform,"" would limit collective bargaining for public employees across the state.

Kasich was asked during the meeting with reporters if the economic squeeze on workers and schools and local governments made it important symbolically for state lawmakers to take a pay cut.

""I think they should be treated like all other state employees, and state employees are actually going to get a pay raise,"" the governor answered.

A raise? In these times? While closing an $8 billion state budget deficit?

PolitiFact Ohio was surprised. We asked the governor's office to explain, and looked for some background information on our own.

Members of the General Assembly, we found, receive a base salary of $60,584 -- seventh-highest among state legislatures -- and stipends for leadership positions can raise it toward $90,000. Perks for Ohio lawmakers include public pension benefits and travel reimbursements.

House Bill 41, introduced in January by Norwalk Republican Terry Boose, would cut salaries in the General Assembly and for elected executive officeholders by 5 percent. The bill has not yet had a hearing. Even if enacted, it would not affect legislator salaries during their current term of office.

Legislators did not take the cut in pay that state employees have had for the past two years in the form of 10 mandatory furlough days, or unpaid days off.

The governor's press secretary, Rob Nichols, told us that those days were what Kasich was referring to.

""He was talking about the end of furlough days imposed under the previous administration,"" Nichols said.

Kasich will allow the furloughs to end in July, so ""state workers will, in fact, get a 3.2 percent pay increase. It's not technically a raise, but state workers are going to be getting more money. They will be getting their full salary,"" Nichols said.

In other words, as the song says, they're going to get right back to where they started from.

And where are we?

Despite Nichols explanations, there is no pay raise. State workers will be getting more money in their paychecks, as Nichols noted. But that’s not because they’ll be getting paid more for their time.

Those increases are a result of them working more days at the same rate of pay. When the furloughs end, state workers will no longer be forced to take unpaid days off from work.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kasich’s claim as False.","[('\nThe Plain Dealer, ""Ohio Gov.

"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Kathleen Sebelius']","
One in three harmed during medical care, White House official says
","
It’s no secret that health care costs are rising, but comments by a White House Cabinet member about the quality of care surprised us.

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said at a recent Atlanta Press Club luncheon that ""one of three patients hospitalized (is) harmed by the care they receive.""

Sebelius made the claim while discussing the need to provide better health care under the federal government’s Medicare program. The White House has begun a program to reduce preventable medical errors.

The secretary attempted to drive home the seriousness of the issue by telling the story of a Stone Mountain woman who got an infection during ankle surgery. The woman, Sebelius said, needed another surgery to remove screws previously put in her ankle. She had to take antibiotics at home, needed weekly visits from a home health nurse and additional treatment from a doctor to make sure the infection went away.

Sebelius said such tales are not rare. Still, we wondered about the frequency. Is it really one of three?

The secretary’s office said her claim came from a recent study in the journal Health Affairs. The study’s headline said that adverse effects from medical care in hospitals may be 10 times greater than previously believed.

""Overall, adverse events occurred in 33.2 percent of hospital admissions,"" the nine-page study said.

Several newspapers reported the findings.

""[Medical errors] are a big issue,"" said Dr. Peter Pronovost, director of the Johns Hopkins University Quality and Research Safety Group, who has received praise for his research on the topic.

But is the statistic that Sebelius quoted correct?

Doctors and medical experts began paying more attention to medical errors during care after a landmark 1999 study by the Institute of Health, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers concluded that as many as 98,000 Americans die each year as a result of medical errors.

In November, a team of doctors released its findings on five years worth of medical records from 10 randomly selected hospitals in North Carolina between 2002 and 2007. They chose that state because it has worked hard to improve patient safety in recent years. The research found ""25.1 patient harms per 100 admissions."" Nearly one out of five patients had an adverse effect from medical care, the study found. The greatest percentage of harms came from medical procedures. Medications were a close second. Infections were third on the list.

Dr. Christopher Landrigan, the lead author of the North Carolina study, said the adverse effect from medicine could range from a condition that requires a hospital stay to something as simple as a rash. Landrigan, associate professor of medicine and pediatrics at Harvard Medical Center, said medical errors occur because care and treatment are imperfect.

""The root cause of it is medicine is very complicated,"" Landrigan said, explaining why medical errors are so alarmingly high. ""There is a high risk of something going wrong.""

The April report that Sebelius referenced focused on three hospitals of different sizes located in different parts of the United States. The researchers, led by Dr. David C. Classen, randomly selected patients from all adult age groups admitted to those hospitals during the month of October 2004 and reviewed the records of 795 patients.

The largest forms of problems, nearly 40 percent of them, were related to medicine given for a surgery or procedure. The second-leading cause, nearly 30 percent, was procedure-related. Infections were the third-leading cause, the study found. About one third of the problems required a longer hospital stay. Nearly 8 percent resulted in permanent patient harm, a lifesaving procedure or death.

Landrigan said he didn’t dispute the research in the Health Affairs report. He said Classen and his fellow researchers were more experienced in using some of the tools now used to detect medical errors. Classen and his team did use a broader definition of adverse events than in other studies, saying they did not restrict themselves to whether they were preventable or led to a major disability.

""Fundamentally, the methodology was very sound,"" Landrigan said.

To date, other reviews of the study have been well-received.

""This is one of the best studies that now gives us a sense of how much harm is happening to patients in American hospitals,"" Dr. Robert Wachter, chief of medical service at the University of California, San Francisco, Medical Center, told American Medical News.

Wachter was not involved in the research.

To sum up, Sebelius repeated information from a report that falls in line with other research showing that the problem of medical errors is progressively getting worse. Although the report has not been disputed, there are a few caveats, such as the researchers used a broader definition of adverse events, some of the effects were not life-threatening and the short length of the research of the study. We rate the Sebelius claim as Mostly True.","[('\nHealth Affairs, summary, ""Global Trigger Tool Shows That Adverse Events In Hospitals May Be Ten Times Greater Than Previously Measured,"" April 2011\n\nDocument Cloud, courtesy of Dr. David C.

Bill Nelson criticizes state election bill, cites number of tossed provisional ballots
","
U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson came to Tallahassee during the final week of the legislative session to oppose major changes to election law being considered by the House and Senate.

We've written about the bills before. The House version, HB 1355, passed 79-37 on April 21, 2011, while the Senate bill, SB 2086, is awaiting a floor vote. Among many different provisions, the bills would no longer allow voters who have moved or changed their last name to update their information at the polls on Election Day. Instead, those voters would have to file provisional ballots that are reviewed after the election.

Republicans say it's a way to eliminate possible voter fraud. But Democrats like Nelson say it's an way to suppress the votes of people most likely to change their names (women) and people most likely to move frequently (young people and college students). At a press conference with Democratic state legislators on May 2, Bay News 9 and Central Florida 13 reporter Troy Kinsey asked Nelson what was so wrong with people having to cast a provisional ballot.

""Look at history,"" Nelson answered. ""Look at the provisional ballots in 2008. Fifty-five percent of them were discounted. Fifty-five percent of the people who cast a provisional ballot in the last presidential election -- their vote did not count.""

We turned to the stats to see in Nelson was right.

The Pew Center on the States, widely considered a nonpartisan source, studied the result of provisional ballots cast during the 2008 fall presidential election across all 50 states. They found that, in Florida, wide variation existed between counties on the percentage of provisional ballots that were allowed by local canvassing boards, as well as why ballots that were not counted were ultimately disallowed.

More than 80 percent of provisional ballots cast in Duval County were counted, while less than 60 percent were counted in Hillsborough County. In South Florida, 34 percent of the provisional ballots were counted in Miami-Dade. In Broward County, just about 6 percent of the provisional ballots cast ultimately were counted in the results, Pew found.

""The precise causes of these variations within Florida are unclear, but the reasons why these ballots were rejected provide a slightly more detailed picture,"" Pew wrote. ""In Broward County, 100 percent of rejected provisional ballots were not counted because they were cast by voters not registered in the state. In Hillsborough County, more than 40 percent of rejected provisional ballots were rejected for being cast in the wrong precinct. Both Duval and Miami-Dade counties saw substantial numbers of rejected provisional ballots because voters’ eligibility could not be established.""

In total, Pew reported that 35,635 Florida voters submitted provisional ballots in the 2008 fall election (.42 percent of the total 8.4 million who cast ballots for president). Of the 35,635 ballots submitted, 17,314 were counted and 18,321 were not counted.

To line that up with Nelson's claim, that means 51.4 percent of the provisional ballots submitted were not counted for one reason or another.

We checked the Pew numbers with the Department of State and found just a slight discrepancy. The Department of State says 17,312 votes were counted -- two fewer votes than Pew reported -- but not enough to change the percentage of those who submitted provisional ballots but did not have them counted.

State Department spokesman Chris Cate also provided us with provisional ballot statistics from the 2010 general election. They are worth noting because the percentage of provisional ballots ultimately discounted was cut in half when compared to 2008. In the 2010 fall election, local canvassing boards considered 13,181 provisional ballots. Canvassing boards wound up counting 9,790 of the votes and tossing out 3,391 provisional ballots -- or 25.7 percent of the total number of provisional ballots.

Nelson said that ""55 percent of the people who cast a provisional ballot (in Florida) in the last presidential election -- their vote did not count."" Two slight clarifications: Nelson is slightly high on the percentage claim, and he fails to note that the percentage of provisional ballots counted improved greatly in 2010. We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('\nU.S. Sen Bill Nelson, press conference, May 2, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Department of State Chris Cate, May 2, 2010\n\nPew Center on the States, ""Provisional Ballots: An Imperfect Solution,"" July 2009\n\nDepartment of State, 2008 provisional ballot information, accessed May 2, 2010\n\nDepartment of State, 2010 provisional ballot information, accessed May 2, 2010', 'http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/ELEC_ProvBallot_Brief_0709.pdf')]",/factchecks/2011/may/02/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-criticizes-state-election-bill-cites-n/
"['Ohio', 'Elections', 'Jon Husted']","
Jon Husted says under his plan Ohio would be among most aggressive on early voting time frame
","
Secretary of State Jon Husted says he’s on a quest to balance ""access and accuracy"" when it comes to a package of election reforms he is hoping to get Ohio lawmakers to enact.

But that hasn’t stopped critics of the Republican’s plan from pointing out that Husted’s proposal to change Ohio’s election laws would narrow the time during which voters can cast ballots through in-person early voting as well as reduce the days in which to request absentee ballots.

Under Husted’s proposal, the voting window would allow 21 days to request absentee ballots and 16 days for in-person early voting -- down from 33 days for absentee voting and 35 days for in-person voting under Ohio’s current voting law.

Hoping to blunt criticism, including the notion that his plan goes too far in restricting access to voters, Husted appeared April 7 at an event held by the Ohio League of Women Voters. During his remarks, Husted touched on the issue of the shrinking window for early voting and absentee ballot requests contained in his plan.

Husted said under his plan ""it still will be one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in America,"" according to a report from Gongwer News Service, a Statehouse-based paid information service.

Given the criticism of Husted’s plan, Politifact Ohio decided to check into Husted’s statement.

There are two forms of early voting in Ohio: in-person early voting and absentee ballot voting.

For information on in-person early voting and absentee voting across all 50 states, we turned to the National Association of Secretary of States.

Only 33 states plus the District of Columbia offer in-person early voting. Further research revealed that two of those states — Georgia and North Dakota — only do so on a county-by-county basis so we threw those two states out for the purposes of this analysis.

Among the 31 remaining states (and the District of Columbia), Ohio ranks either sixth or seventh for time available to vote in-person, depending on how you rank Wisconsin’s 30-day period compared to Ohio’s.

That’s because while Ohio’s early voting window is 35 days long, it excludes certain weekend days so really there are only between 27 and 31 days when early voting can actually occur. And, it can vary from county to county, depending on their policies concerning weekend hours.

Hamilton County, for example, was open for in-person early voting all five Saturdays in October 2010 while Pike County allowed it only on the last Saturday in October thus the range of four days across Ohio counties.

Husted’s proposal would open up a 16-day in person voting window, however, his proposal has specific guidelines for all counties to follow regarding weekend hours. His plan would allow in-person voting locations be open only one Saturday. They would be closed on all Sundays and in-person voting would halt the Friday before Election Day. That means there would be 11 possible days for early voting under Husted’s plan.

Under Husted’s proposal, Ohio would drop to have the 21st biggest window for in-person voting among the 31 early voting states plus the District of Columbia, according to the NASS data. Put another way, only 11 states that allow early voting statewide would have shorter periods than Ohio to vote early in-person.

Husted’s communications director, Maggie Ostrowski, said that Ohio’s top elections officer was trying to make the point that even with a condensed window Ohio ""will provide more opportunities than many other states.""

In large part that’s because Ohio has a ""no-fault"" law — a provision in Ohio law which allows voters to request an absentee ballot without having to cite any reason. States with longer windows may have fewer voters able to take advantage of it if they don’t have a ""no-fault"" policy in place, she said.

""Longer time frame is one way to look at it, but we have more opportunities for more people,"" Ostrowski said. ""They may have longer windows, but you have to have an excuse to vote. They aren’t no-fault. I don’t think it’s fair to compare Ohio to states that don’t have no-fault voting.""

While it may be a fair point about comparing no-fault voting states with those without easy access to absentee ballots, we return to Husted’s words which were that Ohio would still have ""one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in America.""

His statement doesn’t offer any qualifier about no-fault voting, and uses the phrase ""time frame"" which clearly means span of days.

Ostrowski also noted that many states are changing their early voting period, and said it’s not a totally fair to compare what Ohio would look like in the future to what other states look like today. We checked with the National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) and there are 16 states actively considering adding or changing their in-person early voting periods, according to a legislation tracker on the NCSL website. And some state legislatures have as many as 10 competing bills pending, making it impossible to determine where Ohio would stack up relative to other states in the future.

So while it’s possible that Ohio could move a great deal up or down the scale depending on what happens in more than a dozen other states regarding in-person early voting, Husted’s remarks on April 7 weren’t made in the context of what could possibly happen in other states in the future and where Ohio could rank in the future.

Next we looked at how the time frame for Ohio’s absentee voting would stack up against other states if his plan became law.

Because NASS doesn’t track when the absentee ballot request window begins in all 50 states, we turned to information collected by a non-partisan academic research center at Reed College known as the Early Voting Information Center.  

Three states -- Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Utah are toss outs, as as they appear to have no starting points in their windows for requesting absentee ballots.

Of the remaining 47 states and the District of Columbia, Ohio’s current absentee ballot window of 33 days would rank roughly in the middle,  26th among the eligible states, according to the Early Voting Information Center.

If Husted’s plan were adopted, the absentee ballot request window would shrink to 21 days, which would make Ohio 39th among the eligible states. That means there would be only be eight states with a shorter time frame for absentee ballot requests if Husted’s plan became law—excluding the trio of toss-out states.

So how does Husted fare on the Truth-O-Meter.

He said if his plan were put in place, the voting window ""will be one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in America."" But Husted isn’t even close. Ohio would rank 21st among 34 states that offer early in-person voting and 39th among 47 states that offer absentee voting.

His assertion is so wrong, it’s ridiculous. And as the top elections officer in the state of Ohio, he has a responsibility to get it right.

For that kind of statement, PolitiFact Ohio ""aggressively"" strikes a match to his well-tailored trousers. We rate Husted’s claim Pants On Fire.","[('\nGongwer News Service, ""Secretary of State Pitches Alternative to Photo ID Bill,"" April, 7, 2011\n\nPhone interview with Tim Storey, senior fellow for elections information section for National Conference of State Legislators.

"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Herman Cain']","
Oh Canada! Cain says nation way behind U.S. in CT machines
","
Health care in the United States is costly for patients. But it might prove even more costly for elected officials next year.

Both Republicans and Democrats hope to wield public concerns over health care as a potent weapon in the upcoming presidential and congressional elections, and some early candidates have already started swinging away.

Former Godfather's Pizza CEO and conservative activist Herman Cain set up a presidential exploratory committee in January and last month attacked President Barack Obama’s health care initiative. He described the health care plan approved by Democrats in the House and Senate as socialized medicine that increases wait times for diagnostic tests.

Cain, a cancer survivor, said longer waits could put cancer patients like him in danger by delaying discovery.

Cain told The Root, a black perspectives online magazine: ""In Canada, the number of CT scan machines per 1,000 people is like one-tenth of what we have here in this country. That's why people have to wait.""

That’s a huge difference, so PolitiFact decided we’d pass this statement through our own diagnostic equipment to see whether Cain’s prognosis is accurate.

Computerized tomography scanners are X-ray machines that emit several beams from different angles simultaneously to produce detailed images of any part of the body. CT scanners are used to look for bleeding in the body, tumors and other internal damage.

Unfortunately Cain would not tell us how he determined the number of CT scanners in Canada and the United States. In fact, neither he nor anyone from his staff would say anything to us beyond, ""I don’t think we’re going to comment.""
But PolitiFact did find data quantifying the number of CT scans per capita.

Canada had 12.7 CT scanners per 1 million residents in 2007, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The United States had 34.3 per million in 2007, the last year the organization had data for the United States.

Canada has fewer CT scanners per capita than Greece and Portugal, two countries on the verge of bankruptcy, and it certainly has fewer than the United States, but not ""like one-tenth."" It’s more like one-third.

Even though Cain’s numbers were not factually accurate, his general opinion that decreased diagnostic capacity puts patients at risk still deserves scrutiny.

Canada spends less on medical treatment and therefore does have less capacity, said Edwin Meyer, founder of Buffalo-based Cross Border Access, a company that helps negotiate hospital billing rates for Canadians coming to the United States for medical services.

Canada does a good job prioritizing who needs service right away and by doing so keeps costs for patients low, Meyer said.

But a person with a non-life-threatening injury that keeps them out of work and causes constant pain may not receive diagnostic services and surgery right away.

""People that are in need but stable can end up waiting a long time,"" Meyer said.

While the United States has better capacity in general, many Americans, like the uninsured, do not have access to this capacity, said William Custer, a professor at the Institute of Health Administration at Georgia State University.

The high number of CT scanners has also helped to drive up the cost of health care in the United States, but Custer said there is little evidence that this more costly service leads to better health outcomes.

Ultimately, you can’t judge a national health care system on medical capacity alone, he said.

""They make trade-offs and we make trade-offs,"" Custer said. ""It’s a matter of taste.""

State senator says it probably costs more than $300,000 to run for Pedernales Electric Cooperative board
","
State Sen. Troy Fraser, who’s been in the thick of years-long tussling regarding the Pedernales Electric Cooperative, wants co-op directors elected from regional single-member districts.

Pitching legislation mandating that change, the Horseshoe Bay Republican noted the expense of seeking election via at-large balloting open to the co-op’s entire membership. Fraser told the Senate Committee on Business & Commerce on April 19: ""If you’re a person that lives, let’s say, in Marble Falls and you want to run, you’ve got to... solicit the support of 210,000 people, probably costing in excess of $300,000 to run for a co-op board, which is a little absurd.""

Ka-ching. Is his claim on the money?

In an interview, Fraser pointed out that each of the seven Pedernales directors is elected by the co-op’s 200,000-plus members, spread across a 24-county region. In contrast, Texas House members represent about 139,000 residents each.

Fraser told us his cost estimate presumes a board candidate would send at least one mailing to every co-op member, at a minimum cost of $1 per recipient so a single mass mailing would cost more than $200,000. He said candidates also spend money on items such as websites.

But what do campaign spending reports for Pedernales director candidates show? Turns out there are none. The state does not require them because the co-op is not a government entity.

For his part, Fraser referred to Texas House candidate campaign spending tallies indicating that into October 2010, the least costly winning House campaign had cost about $296,300.The most costly campaign--which did not end in victory--had cost more than $1.2 million.

Fraser drew the spending figures from a Texas Tribune chart published in November. The chart, limited to candidates in contested races, totaled spending from July 2009 through Oct. 23, 2010 -- hence understating how much candidates likely spent through the November general election.

And according to the chart, Nueces County Republican Raul Torres spent $296,284 through Oct. 23 on his way to victory while Democrat Patrick Rose of Dripping Springs spent $1.2 million in his re-election try.

Using the same chart, we later identified more than 50 House winners who spent less than Torres through Oct. 23, though many of the lightest spenders faced only third-party challengers. Re-elected GOP Rep. Susan King, on her way to besting a Libertarian and Independent, spent the least: $30,995. Among victors with major-party opponents, Republican John V. Garza, who unseated Democratic Rep. David Leibowitz, had spent $72,583.

When we inquired into the cost of past board campaigns, PEC spokeswoman Anne Harvey encouraged us to contact candidates directly. We emailed or left telephone messages with the 13 candidates for two board seats last year, asking how much they spent on what.

Among defeated hopefuls, Ken Rigsbee saId he spent $2,700 of his own money traveling around, Dan Pedersen said he spent around $1,000 on yard signs, T-shirts and advertising and Ted Lehr said he spent less than $500. At the low end, Thornton Keel said he spent a small sum to buy a list of co-op members. Geoffrey Vanderpal and Bob Driscoll each said he spent no money.

More detail from losing candidates::

--Steven Carriker said he spent $2,000 almost exclusively on newspaper ads. He said too that a group that backed him, Clean Water Action, sent out 4,000 postcards, perhaps costing $2,000.

David Foster, state program director for Clean Water Action in Texas, told us in an interview that for the annual board races in 2008 through 2010, the group spent $15,000 on postcards listing its preferred candidates that were mailed to the group’s 7,000 members in the co-op's service area. It also reached members electronically and by phone.

Carriker said he doesn’t think a shift to 30,000-resident districts, as Fraser proposes, would change much: ""I recognize (due to first-hand experience) the formidable task of communicating successfully with 200,000 other members, (but) it is hardly a less formidable task to communicate with even one-seventh that number.""

--Joe Summy said: ""I had little money, less than $3,000 and had to depend on volunteers and word of mouth.""  As for Fraser’s $300,000 figure, he said,  ""I have no way to confirm that number.""

Summy’s email continued: ""However, unless a candidate has the backing of special interest groups and/or political parties the common candidate has little chance of winning....especially when only 10-12 percent of the (co-op) members vote. in the 2010 races, 20,727 co-op members voted, according to results made public by the co-op at the board’s June 28 meeting.

""The PEC area is over 8,000 square miles. Five of the six candidates have won"" in elections since 2009 ""because they had the support of various special-interest groups"" which ""want to maintain the at-large system because any candidate with their support has a tremendous advantage,"" Summy said. ""The system now has been established to keep a certain elite in power.""

As for successful candidates:

--Chris Perry, who won the District 4 seat, said he spent less than $1,000 of his own money, mostly for a website, leaflets and travel. He said he did not seek or accept donations, but fielded endorsements ""from a variety of individuals and organizations but I have no idea what they may have spent or what they may have done to support me, other than notifying their friends or members of their endorsement.""

Perry said: ""I don’t know anyone who would"" spend $300,000-plus. ""It would be an outrageous amount of money to spend on a cooperative board election.""

--Ross Fischer, who won the District 5 race, said he spent about $4,200, or less than $1 for each of the 4,824 votes he drew ""to communicate directly with PEC voters in order to overcome a coordinated effort to control"" the board. He said in his email that Fraser ""is right that it is cost prohibitive to reach (all) PEC voters. A candidate must be willing to spend money in order to compete with the special interests who want to raise rates in order to finance an environmental agenda. Single-member districts would make it financially feasible for an average ratepayer to run for the PEC board, and would increase meaningful communications between members and their board.""

Fischer and Summy both referenced a Feb. 15 letter to board members from the steering committee of PEC4U which describes the group’s formation four and a half years ago as a ""loose-knit organization and website"" that initially wanted whose ""initial motivation was ""to encourage PEC to reduce fossil fuel use and make renewable energy and conservation programs available to all PEC members. We quickly learned that no real change would come about without substantial changes in PEC's governance and board election process.""

The letter also expresses pride in the group’s recruitment and backing of candidates in the last three board elections. ""You are all directors whom we endorsed and helped get elected,"" the letter says. ""We feel that our close relationship with the press, as well as with Clean Water Action and Public Citizen, played a key role in those elections.""

At Public Citizen’s Texas office, researcher/organizer Andy Wilson told us that group does not endorse Pedernales board candidates but encourages voter turnout. Wilson said it has taken no position on whether co-op members should elect the board from single-member districts.

Next, we asked PEC4U steering committee members about their expenditures. They replied that the group never has had a political kitty and has not made candidate donations or campaign-related expenditures. ""We have no hidden deep pockets and have not spent money on campaigns,"" said committee member Sue Barnett.

However, steering committee member John Watson said, the group has ""engaged in emailing, phoning and personal contact"" with co-op members. Member Bill Christensen said: ""Though some individuals may have spent a few dollars here and there to make photocopies and such, PEC4U itself does not spend any money - it doesn't even have a bank account or any legal status. It's a very loose organization.""

Member Ric Sternberg said: ""My out-of-pocket expenses have been about $30/year for (web) domain renewal fees since 2006 or 2007  . . . I think we may have also donated some poster board and toner and paper for our printer.""

Summing up: Of 10 candidates who responded to our inquiry, only one said he spent more than $4,000; others said they spent from nothing to $3,000.

We circled back to Fraser, who said his original ""offhand remark"" reflected what it would cost a typical resident to beat a foe backed by PEC4U and Clean Water Action, which along with Public Citizen he called ""the machine."" Noting that only the well-prepared Fischer has bested such a candidate since the groups started influencing co-op elections, Fraser said: ""I’m not sure if it’s $300,000 or $50,000 or $1.2 million... Under any scenario, if you’re going to contact 210,000 people, it’s expensive.""

Our final analysis of Fraser’s cost declaration: Get out.

We see no reason for using any Texas House race as a guide to estimating the costs of seeking a board seat.  And the responses we got from most of last year’s candidates suggests there’s no basis for pegging the costs of such campaigns anywhere near $300,000, which is more than 60 times--60!--the most that anyone told us they spent.

The statement is so inaccurate, it smokes.

Wisconsin Sen. Chris Larson says Republicans offered shots of alcohol for recall signatures against Democrats
","
In the spring of Wisconsin’s discontent, voters launched recall campaigns against 16 state senators.

That’s every state lawmaker who was eligible to be recalled -- and four times the number who have been forced into such elections in the 85 years that Wisconsin state officers could be recalled.

The recalls followed the collective bargaining-curbing budget-repair bil introduced by Republican Gov. Scott Walker in February 2011. Formal recall campaigns targeted eight of the 14 Democratic senators who fled to Illinois for three weeks in an attempt to prevent a vote on Walker’s bill; and eight GOP senators, all of whom voted for the bill, which became law but is tied up in court.

So far, the campaigns against three Democrats failed to collect enough signatures; efforts targeting the other 13 lawmakers are pending.

On April 22, 2011, first-term state Sen. Chris Larson, a Milwaukee Democrat, stirred the pot with an Internet comment about the still-active recall campaign against Kenosha Democrat Robert Wirch, a 19-year state lawmaker.

""In case you missed it,"" Larson tweeted, ""Republicans offered free shots to sign recall petitions against Dems.""

That’s shots, as in shots of alcohol, and ""Dems"" as in Democrats.

Let’s belly up to the bar and see if that’s what happened.

Larson’s tweet linked to an article posted the same day on Alternet.org, a website that says it aims to ""inspire action and advocacy on the environment, human rights and civil liberties, social justice, media, health care issues, and more.""

Larson stated flatly that Republicans offered the free shots, but the article hedged, saying, ""Republicans apparently had to give out free shots of booze"" to people to get them to sign petitions to recall Democratic state senators.

So, the article itself does not fully back up Larson’s claim.

The article refers readers to the previous night’s edition of the liberal ""Rachel Maddow Show"" on MSNBC.  

Maddow told how earlier that day, the liberal HuffingtonPost.com posted audio of a conversation she said documented a claim by Democrats that circulators of petitions to recall Democratic state senators ""offered free shots of booze"" to get people to sign the petitions.

The audio accompanied an article by Huffington Post reporter Amanda Turkel that said a ""Democratic source"" provided the audio, as well as a draft of a complaint that the Wisconsin Democratic Party might file with the state Government Accountability Board, which oversees elections.

The draft of the complaint, according to the article, was signed by a woman who was with friends on Feb. 27, 2011, at John’s Main Event in Burlington, a small city in southeastern Wisconsin. The article said the woman heard that someone in the restaurant was offering free shots to people who signed a recall petition against Wirch.

The woman, the article continued, said a bartender showed her the recall petition and told her that if she signed it, she and her friends would get free shots.

Here’s some of what’s in the roughly one minute of audio:

A woman says, ""OK, so you’re going to get us one, two, three, four, five shots if we sign this.""

A man replies, ""That’s right. I’ll buy them.""

There’s a bit of chatting among a group of women about the recall petition, then the woman who spoke to the man says to her friends, amid some other chatter:

""Because it’s bull-crap, what he did. Because it’s bull-crap that they went out of the state,"" she said, apparently referring to Wirch and the other Democratic senators who fled to Illinois. ""That’s bull-crap. No, to recall him, to get him out of there for the bull-crap that he did.""

So, an article and an audio recording indicate someone of unknown party affiliation offered to buy shots of alcohol for a group of women, and perhaps other bar patrons, if they signed a recall petition against one Democrat.  

Asked if Larson had evidence beyond the article he linked to in his tweet, his staff cited the Huffington Post report along with a Wisconsin Radio Network report. The radio report, however, simply mentioned the allegation.

When we talked to Larson, he acknowledged he had no evidence beyond media reports; said he was aware of only the one instance in which shots allegedly were offered; and said he assumed the offer he tweeted about would have been made by a Republican, given that Wirch is a Democrat.

We also called Dan Hunt, chairman of Taxpayers to Recall Robert Wirch, who provided this account: 

Hunt added that the Wirch recall campaign does not condone offering alcohol in exchange for signing petitions, but he noted that the Government Accountability Board has said such a practice is not illegal.

Board spokesman Reid Magney confirmed that offering a shot for a signature is not illegal. But he said, ""We strongly discourage anyone from offering anything of value in exchange for a signature on a petition because it taints the process.""  

Hunt refused to give us the name of the bartender, saying the bartender didn’t want to be interviewed. Hunt said he did pass along our interview request to the bartender. But the man didn’t respond to that, or to a phone message we left with an employee at John’s Main Event.

Wirch didn’t call us back, either, and a spokesman for the state Democratic Party declined comment.

OK, someone get us the tab.

Larson claimed that Republicans offered free shots of alcohol to get people to sign recall petitions against Democrats, framing it in the broadest possible sense.

Larson is correct that multiple free shots were offered. But the record so far shows they were offered by one person, whose party affiliation, if any, isn’t known. And the shots were offered for signatures against only one Democrat.

Larson’s statement contains some element of truth, but wrongly suggests that the shots-for-signatures was more than an isolated incident.

Cicilline says he fought Republican budget that ends ""Medicare as we know it.""
","
Nearly six months after being elected to Congress, David Cicilline is running hard for reelection. On WPRI's ""Newsmakers"" program, which aired April 24, the freshman congressman was asked about a potential opponent.

Cicilline immediately switched to one of his talking points.

""The election is two years away. What voters are going to focus on is who's in Washington fighting and standing up for them. We're in the middle of a big battle about what this country is going to be like in terms of our priorities and our values. We just fought a Republican budget that ends Medicare as we know it.""

The claim that Republicans want to end the government-run health insurance program for those 65 and older is being widely used by Democrats as they attack Republican proposals to cut the budget.

Cicilline has raised the theme repeatedly in recent new releases, YouTube videos and speeches on the floor of the House. He’s also launched a series of visits to senior citizen to discuss ""the effects of the Republican budget on Medicare and Medicaid.""

PolitiFact National addressed one element of the controversy April 20 when it gave a Pants On Fire ruling to the assertion by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that ""Seniors will have to find $12,500 for health care because Republicans voted to end Medicare."" (Details on that ruling can be found at PolitiFact.com.)

A few points are relevant to Cicilline's assertion.

First, there is no Republican budget.

At issue is a budget resolution proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, who proposes eventually replacing Medicare with subsidies that older people would use to ""buy"" private insurance, although the elderly would never see the money -- it would be paid by the government to insurance companies.

The resolution was approved by 235 of the 240 Republicans in the House. Every Democrat, including Cicilline, voted no.

It has no chance in the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. Such resolutions are, as PolitiFact National noted, nonbinding documents that state policy preferences and cannot be viewed as the equivalent of legislation that establishes law.

Second, the GOP proposal does not ""end Medicare as we know it."" It wouldn't even begin to change Medicare as we know it for another 12 years.

Under the Republican plan, developed because the GOP and other critics regard the costs of the current program as unsustainable, Medicare would continue in its present form for people who already receive it. In addition, those 55 or older would be covered by the program once they hit their 65th birthday. So even 12 years from now, part of today's Medicare would remain in place until every recipient covered under the existing rules has died.

The claim would be true for younger people, because the version of Medicare they would see when they retire would be very different. For example, they would have to buy health plans from private insurance companies, with financial assistance and regulation from the government -- akin in some ways to President Obama’s health-care plan that so many Republicans object to. In addition, the eligibility age would gradually rise to 67.

In short, Cicilline, has pushed back against the Republican proposal to change Medicare. But he has mischaracterized a nonbinding budget resolution as a budget. More significantly, he exaggerated the impact of a Republican Medicare proposal to imply that everyone would be affected, while the GOP resolution specifically exempts existing beneficiaries and future beneficiaries who are currently 55 and over.

If he had added those qualifiers, his statement would have been closer to accurate. But he didn’t.

We rate his statement Barely True.

"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Medicare', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Gerry Connolly']","
Gerry Connolly says GOP Medicare plan would line the pockets of private insurance companies
","
Rep. Paul Ryan’s recent proposal to overhaul Medicare opened a round of partisan debate over how to control the costs of popular entitlement programs that are driving the U.S. deep into debt.

The plan, part of the House GOP’s 2012 budget, passed the chamber with no Democratic support. Although it is certain to die in the Senate or on Obama’s desk, Ryan’s effort to reduce the government’s role in providing health insurance to seniors is likely to remain an issue in the 2012 elections. Ryan, R-Wis., is chairman of the House Budget Committee.

Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Fairfax County, recently assailed Ryan’s plan to privatize much of Medicare. Under the proposal, seniors would buy private insurance policies and Uncle Sam would make a fixed payment to insurers to help cover the plans. The system would start in 2022 for everyone who is 65 or younger that year.

""Not one dollar of the increased costs to seniors would be used to reduce the deficit,"" Connolly said in a press release. ""Instead, the Republican plan lines the pockets of the private insurance companies.""

Are Connolly’s comments true?

George Burke, Connolly’s communications director, said the claim was based on projections from the Congressional Budget Office that Ryan’s plan would require seniors to pay more for health coverage but not really reduce government expenses. He said the plan ""lines the pockets"" of insurers because seniors would have to buy private insurance, something they don’t have to do now.

First, let’s discuss how Ryan’s plan would work.

Under the legislation, people who turn 65 after 2022 would get a ""premium support payment"" from Medicare, paid directly to an insurer they select towards the cost of buying private health insurance. The payment is projected to be about $8,000 in 2022 for someone turning 65 that year. As people grow older, the subsidy would increase. That’s because health care costs increase with age.

Ryan’s plan would raise the baseline payment each year by the increase in the Consumer Price Index. That would allow the payment to keep up with overall inflation, although medical costs have been climbing much faster than total inflation.
   
One result, the CBO said, would be that future Medicare recipients ""would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system.""

Let’s go back to Connolly now. We’ll start by addressing the second part of his claim, that requiring seniors to buy private health insurance would ""line the pockets"" of private insurers.

Although Connolly’s language might be dramatic, he’s right about the basic detail. If Americans over 65 start buying private insurance, with their own money or with government funds, total premium levels will climb for private health insurers. And because the largest health insurance companies are publicly traded and seek profits, it is a good bet that they won’t offer money-losing Medicare plans.

The insurers would have to meet standards set by the federal government, however. They would have to charge the same premium to everyone who is the same age, and could not deny coverage to seniors based on pre-existing health conditions.

The Ryan plan would provide higher insurance subsidies to low-income people; those in the top 8 percent of earnings would receive smaller government payments.

So Connolly’s right on part of his claim. The Ryan plan would increase revenues from premiums revenues at private insurers. We won’t pass judgment on whether this is ""lining the pockets"" of these companies, since there is little chance of predicting what profit margins would be like under these plans in 10 years.

Now let’s examine Connolly’s claim that ""not one dollar of the increased costs to seniors would be used to reduce the deficit.""

As we mentioned, the CBO believes that seniors would pay more from their own pockets for health care under Ryan’s plan. So the increased costs to seniors makes sense. But as Joe Antos, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute points out, if seniors have to pay more, government should end up paying less.

The CBO estimates that health costs would be higher under the Ryan plan than under traditional Medicare for a 65-year-old in 2022. The reason for the increase, it says, is that ""both administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates to providers are higher for private plans than for Medicare.""

Antos and Marc Goldwein, an economist at the non-partisan New America Foundation, said the government’s premium payments under the Ryan plan would grow more slowly than Medicare’s expenses under the current set-up. So while there may be little savings initially, over time the government’s share of Medicare spending would fall. Those savings would be available for other programs, including deficit reduction.

Antos also said the payments would encourage health insurers and providers to economize because seniors would not have blank checks to pay for tests and treatments. Health-care insurers and providers would have incentive to ""increase profits through more efficient care, delivered in a more efficient manner.""

Paul Van de Water at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities used the CBO information and his own calculations to estimate the cost difference between Ryan’s plan and the current system.

Under the current system, Van de Water says a typical 65-year-old pays $6,150 for premiums and out-of-pocket costs on Medicare and supplemental coverage. The government pays about $8,600.

In 2022, he said, a 65-year-old would see out-of-pocket costs double to $12,500, while the government’s share of costs would fall by $600, to $8,000. So while the government would see some savings, Ryan’s plan ""increases the total health costs for beneficiaries by vastly more than it reduces the federal government’s spending,"" Van de Water said.

Dean Baker, another left-leaning economist, said the plan could save the government money over time, but only at the cost of much higher payments from seniors. He, like Van de Water and the CBO, said using private insurers will mean higher costs and more inefficiencies. Those inefficiencies cost money.

Let’s review:

The liberal economists don’t like Ryan’s plan and say it would harm seniors, but they concede it would lead to lower government spending on health care costs, at least over time. That contradicts Connolly’s assertion that no money from these increased costs would help pay down the deficit. It’s true that the new payments by seniors would go towards private insurers, but savings from lower government spending could go towards deficit reductions.

We rate Connolly’s claim Half True.","[('\nRep.

Comparing Florida's growth management laws to others across the country
","Here's a secret about floor sessions of the Florida House of Representatives -- they can get pretty repetitive. Most legislators ask questions about bills that they already know the answers to, and are simply asking the questions to make political points. Most amendments offered by Democrats in the GOP-dominated body fail. And most always, a bill's fate is known well ahead of time.

But for hours, members go through a ritualistic sparring that -- to the first-time viewer -- can look unscripted.

We start with that description, because we fact-checkers must admit to sometimes being guilty of tuning it all out.

That is, until, our name is being called.

The situation occurred on April 21, 2011, during a debate about a bill that would ease the amount of oversight the state Department of Community Affairs has over local land use issues. HB 7129 was going to pass, after all. The debate was academic.

But Rep. Chris Dorworth, R-Lake Mary, shook us awake with his floor remarks advocating on behalf of the bill.

""This is ripe for a PolitiFact, but I've asked in almost every committee we've seen this bill -- I don't believe any other state in the union has a system like we do,"" he said. ""I think we might be the only (state) in the United States of America that has a statewide review of local land use and zoning decisions. And that means we are 50th, or 49th at worst, in terms of the fact that we have to get our local decisions approved through the state.""

First off, thanks, Rep. Dorworth, for the plug.

The issue here is the state Department of Community Affairs' ability to review local comprehensive plans and amendments, and more specifically, to determine whether or not they are in compliance with state growth management laws. If the DCA finds a local comprehensive plan not in compliance, a judge is asked to settle the discrepancy.

Dorworth and others want to relax that oversight, believing it can be unnecessary and burdensome. As Dorworth suggested, he also believes it's a one-of-a-kind standard in the United States. HB 7129 prescribes a more-streamlined process that attempts to cut the DCA review period in half, and strip some of the power the state agency now has to object to local land use decisions.

We let Dorworth know that we were taking his challenge to fact-check his claim, and he said he has asked 10 different times if another state has Florida's system of review. ""No one seemed to know,"" he told us. ""People said Oregon has something like ours, but then they said that it's not the same.""

Understanding Florida's system

Without getting too technical, we're not talking about a state review of every land use decision a local government makes (Dorworth oversimplified things in his original statement, which we will factor in when making our ruling). We're talking about comprehensive plans, which offer rough guidance on how a community can develop over time. The plan and corresponding maps let you know where the agricultural land in an area is -- and what someone can possibly build there -- and where a city defines its urban core and what can go along with that.

As municipalities grow, they sometimes want or are asked to redraw their plans to accommodate more dense development. A common example would be wanting to designate agricultural or rural land for a more intense use. Florida has a very prescribed process for that, which includes time for the state to review the amendment and public hearings at the local level. (Here's a flow chart to help you follow.)

If the local government approves the amendment, DCA then decides whether it is in compliance with state law. If the DCA deems the amendment is not in compliance, the local government is often asked to alter its plan, or to take the matter to court. In a contentious case, it's a judge who ultimately decides whether or not the amendment is permitted.

The system in other states

Rather than checking the 49 other states individually to see whether Dorworth is correct, we got a road map of places to examine from Stuart Meck, an associate research professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey who has written about state planning. He said several states, including Florida, had some level of state review of local land use decisions -- though the level of oversight varied. At each stop, we asked state planners or planning experts what other states might include stringent reviews of some local planning decisions.

Most all states have some sort of appellate review of planning decisions, whether it's through the state government or through the courts, or both. But as we searched over the course of a week, we built a final list of suspects that most mirror Florida. They are the states of Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, Vermont and Rhode Island.

In the Northeast, Vermont and Rhode Island have similar laws that give the state oversight over land use decisions, but only if local governments want to participate in state development grant programs. It's a carrot approach, said Jared Rhodes, the chief of Rhode Island's Division of Planning.

In Rhode Island, a state review of local comprehensive plan amendments is essentially required, Rhodes said. But if the state does not approve of the amendment, it is still considered valid. ""A state denial does not necessarily put the brakes on it,"" he said.

In Vermont, municipalities have the option of submitting plans and plan amendments to state-created regional planning commissions. Local governments that receive approvals from the regional planning commissions can then be eligible for state grant funding, said Joss Besse, the director of community planning with the Vermont Department of Housing and Community Affairs.

In Washington, local governments are required to send prospective land use changes to the state's Department of Commerce for review. But the state provides only technical assistance and does not override local decisions. ""State agency written correspondence will not state that local plans are out of compliance with the (growth management act),"" the state says on its website. ""State agencies may express concerns, but conclusory statements as to compliance will be avoided."" Oregon's rules -- which were created in 1973 -- are more stringent, and built the framework for Florida's law, former DCA secretary Tom Pelham told us.

All Oregon cities and counties are required to have a comprehensive plan, and those plans must be approved by a seven-member state board. That was finished by 1985, said Bob Rindy, senior policy analyst and legislative coordinator with the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development. But when plans are amended, Rindy said, typically there is not much oversight.

Local plan amendments are considered finalized 21 days after they are adopted by the local government unless someone appeals. Appeals, which can be initiated by the state or other affected parties, are first heard by a state Land Use Board of Appeals and then could enter the state court system.

The rules are different, though, when local jurisdictions seek to expand their urban growth boundaries. Those expansions need the approval of the state, Rindy said. ""When cities try and move out into farmland to grow larger, then the state has oversight over the decision how much they expand that boundary by,"" he said. ""That's one of the things that puts us in the limelight.""

And then there is Hawaii, which by our estimation has the most state-level oversight of planning decisions -- even more so than in Florida.

The state of Hawaii's Land Use Commission holds sweeping power over granting development rights outside the urban centers of the island chain, said David L. Callies, Kudo Professor of Law at the University of Hawaii, who was written a book about Hawaii's system for land use planning.

The commission, appointed by the governor, decides whether land should be classified Agriculture, Conservation, Urban or Rural. Only in the Urban district, which makes up less than 4 percent of land in the state, do local land use controls like zoning apply without shared authority by the Land Use Commission, Callies said. If property owners wish to reclassify their land in order to develop it, they must receive the permission of the Land Use Commission.

Callies said the commission generally accepts large-lot development projects in the Agriculture district. But, if ""your land is in Conservation, you almost have no chance."" Callies says the system is the most regulated in the country, and that going from raw land to completed development could take 10 years.

Our ruling

This is a tough claim to rule on for a couple of reasons. First, Dorworth oversimplified things when he said Florida reviews local land use decisions. The state review is of changes to comprehensive plans. Second, Dorworth said only that he might be right that Florida is the only state in the country with a state review procedure.

Our analysis shows that Florida has a unique form of state review, but it's not the only state to have some oversight.

Some are certainly less stringent. Vermont and Rhode Island offer incentives to provide oversight, while Washington offers just technical assistance to local governments.

Oregon is similar in that major changes -- in its case, an expansion of the urban service boundary -- require state approval.

And Hawaii has a system with a great amount of state oversight.

Here's what Dorworth said: ""This is ripe for a PolitiFact, but I've asked in almost every committee we've seen this bill -- I don't believe any other state in the union has a system like we do. I think we might be the only (state) in the United States of America that has a statewide review of local land use and zoning decisions. And that means we are 50th, or 49th at worst, in terms of the fact that we have to get our local decisions approved through the state.""

If you look at each sentence, Dorworth's first sentence is largely true, his second sentence is really not (except for adding might), and his third sentence is somewhere in between.

The best way to explain this, perhaps, is to say that many states have procedures to review some local planning decisions, but Florida has more regulatory authority than most states. Acknowledging there is some room for debate here, we rate this claim Half True.","[('Florida House debate, April 21, 2011\n\nHB 7129, growth management bill, accessed April 29, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with former DCA secretary Tom Pelham, April 28, 2011\n\nInterview with Jared Rhodes, chief of Rhode Island Division of Planning, April 29, 2011\n\nInterview with Stuart Meck, Associate Research Professor at Rutgers, April 26, 2011\n\nInterview with Bob Rindy, senior policy analyst and legislative coordinator with the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development,\n\nInterview with David L.

Dick Saslaw said the Senate would not alter its redistricting plan
","
As is almost always the case with a legislature divided, this year’s General Assembly redistricting process was agonizing and fraught with drama.  

The legislature’s first stab at new election maps was vetoed by Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican. He said districts proposed for the state Senate did not pass constitutional muster for compactness and preserving the concept of one-man, one-vote. The plan, which the chamber’s Democratic majority drew, would have lumped four Republican senators into two districts.

McDonnell said little about about the portion of the bill that set new districts for the House of Delegates. That plan, drawn by the House Republican majority, squeezed several Democrats out of their districts, including Minority Leader Ward Armstrong, D-Henry.

House Republican responded to the governor’s overall veto by saying they would tweak their part of the redistricting plan. But Senate Democrats were defiant.

""We are not going to change one period or one comma,"" Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax, declared on April 16. Saslaw said the Senate plan was constitutional and threatened to take the matter to court.

Now, fast forward to April 27, when legislators reached a tentative deal on a new plan leaving Democrats in control of the Senate, but unlike the original plan, weakening their chances of adding to the 22-18 majority.

Confronted with his original statement of stubbornness, Saslaw conceded that plenty of periods and commas had been changed in those two weeks and he’d changed his tune.

""I lied,"" he joked. ""It was an unrealistic choice of words ... both sides gave a little.""

Well, that makes our life easy. In the heat of battle, the ever-fiery Saslaw was obstinate and braced for tough negotiations. But in the end, cooler heads prevailed and he acknowledged that his remarks had been bombast.

Still, it represents a 180-degree reversal. Full Flop! ","[('\nRichmond Times-Dispatch, ""McDonell vetoes legislature’s redistricting plan,"" April 16, 2011.\n\nRichmond Times-Dispatch, ""Senate negotiators reach tentative deal on redistricting,"" April 28, 2011.', 'http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/virginia-tech-shooting/2011/apr/16/tdmain01-mcdonnell-vetoes-legislatures-redistricti-ar-976120/')]",/factchecks/2011/apr/29/richard-saslaw/dick-saslaw-said-senate-would-not-alter-its-redist/
