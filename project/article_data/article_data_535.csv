Taxpayer incorrectly says Austin school district tops other big districts in per-student spending
","An activist made his case against voters approving a record $1 billion Austin school bond proposition in part by saying the school district tops other big Texas districts in per-student funding. We wondered about that. ""Austin ISD has the highest taxable property value per student of all school districts in Texas,"" Roger Falk of the Travis County Taxpayers Union wrote in a November 2017 commentary published a few days before the bond won voter approval. ""It also has the lowest tax rate of all districts in our area."" Falk then rebutted the school district’s complaints that it suffers under the state’s school-finance system of recapture, which essentially shifts money from districts with strong property tax bases (like Austin) to property-poor districts. ""A major part of its sales pitch is that recapture is killing the district and driving this bond,"" Falk wrote. ""Recapture, as an argument from the district, actually shows its incompetence, as Austin ISD enjoys the highest per-student funding of all large Texas districts after recapture."" We’re not fact-checking all that Falk said there. But by email, Falk told us he reached his conclusion about the Austin district having the highest per-student funding among large districts by checking on 2016-17 per-student budgeted spending in a dozen high-enrollment districts starting from a Texas Education Agency website. We confirmed from TEA figures posted for the Austin district that the district budgeted $10,949 per student--an amount reached by dividing $906,180,314 shown in AISD state, local and federal receipts by its 82,766 students. That disregards $406 million in local taxes recaptured by the state. Falk said that from TEA-posted figures, he identified only one high-enrollment district with a greater per-student figure; the 157,787-student Dallas district, per the site, drew $11,377 in receipts per student. Falk told us he found from posted figures that 10 other districts--including Houston, San Antonio, Fort Worth, El Paso and Corpus Christi--drew less in receipts per student. ""First or second, my central point remains true: AISD uses recapture to give the impression they have unfair and inadequate funding,"" Falk said. ""Based on their peers, many of whom don't pay recapture, they have superior funding along with a low tax rate."" We confirmed that most of the districts Falk reviewed are classified by the state as ""major urban"" districts, although that classification doesn’t apply to all the districts in his comparison. The exceptions are the Katy, Cypress-Fairbanks, Aldine and Corpus Christi districts. We also learned more precision was possible. Taking into account all funds Next, we asked the state education agency and a couple of school funding experts who advocate for districts at the Capitol to assess Falk’s statement and methodology. By email, TEA spokesperson DeEtta Culbertson said Falk’s per-student figures, based on 2016-17 budgeted data submitted to the state, were accurate to a degree. Culbertson said, for instance, the posted data didn’t reflect final totals of federal funds fielded by each district. She subsequently emailed us a spreadsheet showing that districts ultimately got far more, or less, federal aid than indicated in the reports Falk drew upon. In response to our inquiry, agency experts reviewed audited actual spending data, including federal aid, for the latest available year, 2015-16. By this sort, Culbertson said, Austin fell to eighth among the dozen districts singled out by Falk with $10,805 in per-student spending. Culbertson provided a chart indicating the San Antonio district topped the sampled districts with per-student spending of $12,430. At the low end, the Fort Worth ($10,507); Cypress-Fairbanks ($10,395); Corpus Christi ($10,216) and Arlington ($10,171) districts spent less per student than the Austin district. Also to our inquiry, lobbyist Joe Wisnoski, a former education agency official expert in school finance, similarly said the TEA data cited by Falk was incomplete, leaving unconsidered ""a lot of federal funds"" spent by districts. Like the education agency, Wisnoski turned to audited district revenues for 2015-16 showing  Austin eighth in per-student revenue of all kinds among the districts analyzed by Falk, though his review indicated Austin was sixth if federal aid wasn’t considered. Wisnoski also advised: ""Spending can vary from revenues in a given year and result in a different ranking."" Wisnoski said too that the revenue amounts ""would include money for both operations and debt service,"" a reference to what districts put into paying off bond debt rather than paying for day-to-day operations. Also, Wisnoski wrote, the ""amounts per student are without regard to any variance in the educational needs of, or program participation of, the students in the listed districts."" By email, Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials concurred with Wisnoski’s analysis. Focusing on state’s highest-enrollment districts For our part, we noticed that Falk’s sampling left out a few of the state’s 12 highest-enrollment districts: in 2016-17, the latest year of state-posted counts, these were the Northside and North East districts in Bexar County, the Conroe district in Montgomery County and the Fort Bend district in Fort Bend County. Folding in actual per-student financial data for Falk’s listed districts and for these other districts led us to compose a chart showing the Austin district in 2015-16 trailed eight of the state’s highest-enrollment districts in such spending. Within the sample, the San Antonio district had the greatest per-student figure, at $12,430, followed by the Dallas, Katy, Houston, Ysleta, North East, El Paso and Aldine districts--before the Austin district. Focusing on the 10 largest districts by enrollment puts Austin sixth in per-student revenue, with the Dallas district leading at $12,069 per student. TEN HIGHEST-ENROLLMENT TEXAS SCHOOL DISTRICTS DISTRICT 2015-16 All Funds Total Revenue/Student DALLAS $12,069 KATY $11,568 HOUSTON $11,450 NORTH EAST $10,921 ALDINE $10,905 AUSTIN $10,805 NORTHSIDE $10,722 FORT WORTH $10,507 FORT BEND $10,419 CYPRESS-FAIRBANKS $10,395 SOURCES: Email, DeEtta Culbertson, information specialist, Texas Education Agency, Nov. 13, 2017 and PolitiFact Texas research starting from a TEA website, ""PEIMS District Financial Actual Reports, 2015-16,"" accessed Nov. 15, 2017 We shared the information provided by the agency and Wisnoski with Falk. He replied by email: ""In my goal to provide accurate, thoughtful counterpoint, I defer to those I use for reference, like TEA,"" which collects and analyzes data. ""If they differ with the assessment, I accept their numbers and gladly stand corrected."" Falk followed up: ""My point could have been made by simply saying ‘similar funding to other large districts’ or something to that effect."" Our ruling Falk said the Austin district ""enjoys the highest per-student funding of all large Texas districts"" even after forwarding revenue to the state. Considering all audited actual revenues for 2015-16, it looks to us like the Austin district trailed other high-enrollment districts in spending--ranking sixth or ninth among such districts depending on which ones you include.

Bump stocks are still legal to own and sell in New York state
","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo says New York state law already bans the accessory a gunman used to kill 58 people in Las Vegas last month. The accessory, called a bump stock, allows someone to convert a semi-automatic firearm to a nearly fully automatic one. Lawmakers in New York state have introduced legislation to ban the accessory, but Cuomo during a conference call with reporters called the bill unnecessary. ""The bump stocks are already illegal in the state of New York,"" Cuomo said. ""You can't buy one."" Is Cuomo right? What’s in state law Technically, New York state has banned the use of bump stocks for more than 80 years. The State Legislature passed a law in 1931 that said ""a person who sells or keeps for sale, or offers, or gives, or disposes of any instrument or weapon of the kind usually known as a machine-gun to any person is guilty of a felony."" That statute exists today, but instead says anyone who owns, ""manufactures or causes to be manufactured any machine-gun"" or weapon simulating a machine gun is guilty of a felony. A machine gun is defined as a weapon that can fire a number of shots with one continuous pull of the trigger. A bump stock modifies a gun to simulate that. What’s not in state law Assemblywoman Patricia A. Fahy was one of the first lawmakers to introduce legislation banning bump stocks in New York state after the Las Vegas shooting. She contended that while using a bump stock might be illegal in New York state, owning or selling one is not. The New York State Police agree with her. ""It’s OK to have a bump stock in the back of your car,"" State Police Spokesperson Beau Duffy said. ""But the minute you attach it to a semiautomatic rifle, it’s illegal in New York state."" Bump stocks are not regulated by the state or federal government, so just having one is not a crime, Duffy said. You can also sell them in New York state without penalty. That means you can also legally buy one in New York state without going through a background check, whether it’s through a gun shop or a private seller. National gun law experts have the same understanding of the law. ""Though this current law functionally prohibits New Yorkers from possessing firearms that are equipped with bump stocks or similar devices, our understanding is that it does not prohibit possession of bump stock devices that are un-attached to a firearm,"" said Ari Freilich, a staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Many of the guns a bump stock would work with are now illegal for new gun owners under the SAFE Act in New York state. That doesn’t mean they don’t exist. Residents were allowed to keep guns outlawed by the SAFE Act as long as they registered them with the state by April 2014. Cuomo’s response A spokeswoman for Cuomo clarified that the governor meant to say that someone could not buy and then use a bump stock in New York. ""The governor was stating you cannot buy a bump stock in New York and affix it to a weapon, which is banned under the state’s penal law,"" Abbey Fashouer said. Our ruling Cuomo said ""bump stocks are already illegal in the state of New York. You can't buy one."" That’s not true. It’s illegal to use a bump stock in New York state but you can buy and own one. We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/nov/17/andrew-cuomo/bump-stocks-are-still-legal-own-and-sell-new-york-/

Sen. Thune: Individual mandate fine falls mainly on people making under $50,000
","Senate Republicans’ surprise move to repeal the requirement to have health insurance into their tax reform bill revealed numbers that few people had noted before. (The mandate says that everyone must have coverage or face a fine.) ""80 percent of the tax falls on those who make $50,000 a year or less,"" Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., told Fox News Nov. 15. ""We’re taking a failed policy that punishes people with taxes -- low-income people. (We’re) taking that tax away, giving them tax relief there, and then ploughing that back into tax relief for middle-income families."" This was no throw-away line. Thune is the third-ranking Republican in the party’s Senate leadership, and his colleagues delivered similar versions of the talking point throughout the day. In 2016, the fine for not having insurance stood at $695 for adults. The formula has a few wrinkles that brought the maximum penalty to $2,085 for a family, or 2.5 percent of income, whichever was larger. Going forward, it rises with inflation (unless of course, Congress repeals it). Not everyone without insurance has to pay the fine. The list of exemptions is long. It includes a family with income under $20,800; people who have suffered domestic violence in the household; anyone who has suffered the death of a close family member; someone who has received a utility shut-off notice, and more. Thune’s office said he got his information from 2015 data from the Internal Revenue Service. In one key sense, Thune is correct. Out of all the tax returns sent to the IRS that included a payment of the fine, 79 percent came from households making $50,000 a year or less. (Technically, the income is adjusted gross income, which understates actual income. But on average, the adjustment makes little difference for this check.) However, Thune didn’t specify that he was talking about the number of people. His description of the tax could just as equally refer to the dollars paid. The government collected a little over $3 billion from about 6.6 million households. Of that, about $1.8 billion, 60 percent, came from households with incomes under $50,000. So in dollar terms, about 60 percent of the tax fell on people in that income range, not the 80 percent that Thune said. Thune’s communications staff told us he was talking about the number of people and the number of returns. We reached several health care and tax researchers, and none of them challenged the core numbers. Gordon Mermin with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center ran the numbers and found that as a percentage of income, the tax fell heaviest on the $25,000 to $50,000 group. On average, that group paid 3.1 percent of income. Mermin told us households in this range are more likely to lack insurance, and due to their incomes, are less likely to be able to claim an exemption from the fine. ""People shouldn’t be surprised the $25,000 to $50,000 group is affected the most,"" Mermin said. But researchers found it odd that people making less than $25,000 had paid as much as they did. The $10,000 to $25,000 group accounted for 22 percent of the payments, and about 36 percent of the households. ""Folks are just making a mistake,"" said Jonathan Gruber, one of the architects of Obamacare and an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""Given the exemptions, there is no way such low-income folks should be paying."" The IRS knows this has happened. It’s been sending out letters since 2015, telling filers ""it appears that you may have reported owing too much Health Care Shared Responsibility Payment,"" the penalty’s formal name. ""The IRS has reached out to some taxpayers to let them know they’ve overpaid the penalty, but they don’t have the capacity to do that in all cases,"" said Tara Straw at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank. Straw said the IRS targets people who automatically qualify for an exemption because of their income, a factor that is stronger in states that did not expand Medicaid to people making 138 percent of federal poverty. Where the IRS effort falls short, she said, relates to personal circumstances such as a death in the family or a utility service cut-off notice. Larry Levitt at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of health care data, also agreed that ""there certainly appear to be some low-income people paying the penalty who could be claiming an exemption."" A just-released study from Kaiser suggests the number could be large. The report found that about 5 million uninsured people could get coverage for less than the cost of the penalty. Thanks to the subsidies in Obamacare, the lowest-level plans would be free to many of those people, or if not free, available at a very low cost. If  everyone took advantage of those subsidies, the 6.6 million households paying the penalty because they lack coverage would fall significantly. We don’t know how the numbers would shake out because about 4 million people neither paid the fine nor told the IRS that they had coverage. Republicans offer the repeal of the penalty as a boon to working Americans, and for some it would be. But the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, has found that removing the penalty makes it less likely that people will seek out insurance, even if it would be free or very affordable. Thune said that 80 percent of the individual mandate penalty falls on those who make $50,000 a year or less. In terms of the number of returns in which people paid the fine, that figure is correct. In terms of the dollars collected, it overshoots the mark. People in that income range account for about 60 percent of the payments. Still, an independent analysis showed that households in the $25,000 to 50,000 income range paid the highest percentage of income on the penalty. There’s strong evidence that many lower income people are paying the fine by mistake, and millions could both avoid it and gain health coverage for less than the cost of the fine. But as far as who is paying the fine, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/nov/17/john-thune/sen-thune-individual-mandate-fine-falls-mainly-peo/

Rep. Blackburn claims Phoenix murder rate decline linked to sanctuary city policy drop
","U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., opined in a Fox News post that sanctuary cities threaten public safety and that their policies are lawless. She also linked a decline in Phoenix’s murder rate to the city’s abandonment of a sanctuary policy. ""Sanctuary cities endanger their citizens,"" Blackburn wrote in a Nov. 9 opinion piece. ""When Phoenix dropped its sanctuary city policy in 2008, its murder rate fell 27 percent the following year, and other violent crime rates also fell."" So-called sanctuary cities are jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with immigration authorities, and the extent of their limitations vary widely. President Donald Trump has promised to cut their federal funding, a move supported by Blackburn. We wanted to know if Blackburn was accurate in her claim that Phoenix’ murder rate dropped 27 percent after the city abandoned a sanctuary policy. We did find a decline in the murder rate, but the extent attributable to a policy change is questionable. There’s no widely accepted legal definition for ""sanctuary cities,"" but the term is generally applied to jurisdictions that claim that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility, not a local one. They argue that reporting individuals to immigration officials can undermine communities’ trust in law enforcement officers. Phoenix officials pushed back on the premise that the city ever had sanctuary policies. ""The city has never been a ‘sanctuary city’. We consistently comply with federal and state immigration requirements,"" said Tammy Vo, spokeswoman for the City of Phoenix. Phoenix Police Department Spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard also told PolitiFact they’ve ""never had a policy that made us a sanctuary city."" Blackburn did not return repeated requests for information for this fact check. But we found that some groups considered Phoenix a sanctuary city based on a police department policy up to 2008. Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption and other issues, in May 2008 issued a statement saying the Phoenix police chief was making changes to a policy which the group said ""prohibited police officers from inquiring about the immigration status of individuals and from cooperating with federal immigration officials."" The Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low immigration, in August 2010 also said that until 2008, ""Phoenix was considered by many to be a sanctuary for illegal aliens."" A 2010 report from Police Executive Research Forum said a policy prohibiting Phoenix officers from contacting immigration officials was interpreted by some as providing a ""sanctuary city"" for undocumented immigrants. That policy came under scrutiny after a police officer was shot and killed in September 2007 by an immigrant in the country illegally, the report said. A revised policy implemented in May 2008 required officers to question everyone arrested about their citizenship; allowed officers to contact federal authorities (after supervisory approval) when they suspected an arrestee was in the country illegally; and required records of all contacts with ICE, the report said. While we did not hear back from Blackburn’s office, we found similarities between her claim and a June 2017 Fox News report, headlined, ""Crime drops in Phoenix after city drops sanctuary city status, former cops say."" Fox News cited City-Data.com, saying its numbers showed that ""from 2008 to 2009 Phoenix's murder rate fell 27 percent."" City-Data.com’s figures appear to stem from FBI Uniform Crime Reporting data on murder and nonnegligent manslaughter. But experts cautioned against assuming that a change in one policy is the sole cause of a murder rate decline. ""In terms of Phoenix (and other major metro areas around the country — both ‘sanctuary’ and ‘non-sanctuary’), crime rates, including homicide, actually began falling well before before 2008 and have generally continued to drop since,"" said Daniel E. Martínez, an assistant professor in the School of Sociology at the University of Arizona. ""The supposed relationship that Blackburn is citing is likely due to several other factors beyond these policies."" Without a proper study analyzing Phoenix’s murder rates years before and after a policy and how it compares to similar cities, claims that one policy change drove down the murder rate are suspicious, said Charis E. Kubrin, a professor in the department of criminology, law and society at the University of California, Irvine. Other possible changes in Phoenix, such as better policing, and whether Phoenix’s murder rate decline was consistent with nationwide trends are also important to consider, experts said. ""When one event occurs before another, statisticians say that shows correlation but not necessarily causation. I would be very skeptical of the causation claim, even if it turns out that Phoenix had a sanctuary policy that it rescinded in 2008,"" said Huyen Pham, a law professor at Texas A&M University School of Law. ""You would need a much more rigorous study, including study of other factors that may have caused the drop."" According to City-Data.com, cited by Fox News, the murder rate in Phoenix dropped 10 percent from 2006 to 2007, and about 24 percent from 2007 to 2008. It’s also worth noting that the policy change in Phoenix happened in May 2008, so there were a few months in that calendar year under the former policy. From 2009 to 2010, the Phoenix murder rate did not change; it increased about 4 percent from 2010 to 2011, according to City-Data.com’s figures. A review article by Martinez and two other colleagues notes they are only aware of four empirical studies systematically examining the relationship between limited cooperation policies and crime. ""None of the studies support the claim that 'sanctuaries' are more crime‐prone than non‐sanctuaries,"" their paper said. Blackburn wrote, ""When Phoenix dropped its sanctuary city policy in 2008, its murder rate fell 27 percent the following year."" While the murder rate did decline, experts say the change is likely attributable to many factors, not just a single policy change. Phoenix officials claim the city has never been a ""sanctuary city,"" but some groups pegged the city as such based on a policy in place up to 2008.

Are wages under Scott Walker less than under Jim Doyle, as Democrat for governor Matt Flynn says?
","The day before Gov. Scott Walker made his re-election run official, Matt Flynn issued a pre-emptive strike, comparing the two-term Republican unfavorably to another two-term Wisconsin governor, Democrat Jim Doyle. ""Scott Walker’s time is up,"" was how Flynn, a Democrat running in the 2018 race for governor, began his Nov. 4, 2017 news release. ""Average wages, when adjusted for inflation, are lower today than they were under Jim Doyle."" Walker, who has been governor since 2011, has used a number of economic statistics to argue that things are better than they were under Doyle, who served from 2003 through 2010. So, let’s see how the claim from Flynn, a lawyer and former chairman of the state Democratic Party, stands up. Under Walker, are average wages lower in Wisconsin than they were under Doyle? The claim alludes to Walker bearing some responsibility, but doesn’t directly blame him. And governors play an important but limited role in wages. Flynn’s evidence To back Flynn’s claim, his campaign cited two sets of statistics, both adjusted for inflation. 1. Under Walker in 2016, the median hourly wage was $17.43 -- 5 cents lower than in 2009 under Doyle, ""before the full effects of the Great Recession set in."" The figures are from the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Employment Statistics, which are estimates based on data collected from employers in all industry sectors in Wisconsin. But Doyle served another full year. The figure for 2010 was $17.37 -- 6 cents lower than in 2016 under Walker. More importantly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics warns against using this particular set of data to make comparisons over time. So, we’re discounting this point. 2. The median hourly wage eclipsed $18 in 2003, 2005 and 2010 under Doyle -- but through 2016, had not reached that level under Walker. The figure in 2010, Doyle’s last full year in office, was $18.10, higher than the latest inflation-adjusted figure for Walker, $17.96 in 2016. That’s according to a 2017 report by COWS, formerly known as the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The report cites statistics produced by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. The Washington, D.C.-based institute says it used Current Population Survey data, produced jointly by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau, that are good for comparisons over time.  So, the second statistic tends to support Flynn’s claim -- although both statistics he cites are for median wages, rather than average. While average is the term Flynn used, many people use that word even when referring to median. Some economists recommend using the median, since it is a midpoint -- half of people earned wages below that point and half were above. In contrast, the average can be greatly influenced by extremes; for example, it will be pulled higher if there are many people earning very high incomes. Our numbers We produced our own inflation-adjusted numbers for average wages, the term Flynn used, with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that can be used for comparisons over time. The average weekly wage in Wisconsin in 2016 was $885 -- higher than every year under Doyle -- according to the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. The QCEW figures come from quarterly counts of employment and wages reported by employers covering more than 95 percent of U.S. jobs.  By another measure, for only the private sector, the average weekly wage in August 2017 was $827 -- higher than the August figure for every year under Doyle dating back to 2007 -- according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Employment Statistics figures. (Figures before 2007 are not available). So, the average wage under Walker is higher than when Doyle left office in 2010. Our rating Flynn says that under Walker, ""average wages, when adjusted for inflation, are lower today than they were under Jim Doyle."" Adjusting for inflation, the average wage is higher under Walker than it was when Doyle left office in 2010. But sometimes people use the more common term average when they’re actually referring to the median -- which some economists say is a better measure for wages because an average can be distorted by people who earn very high wages. The median wage was higher when Doyle left office than it is under Walker.   Flynn’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.",/factchecks/2017/nov/17/matt-flynn/wages-under-scott-walker-less-under-jim-doyle-demo/

Former White House aide Gorka says Iran 'every Friday declares war on us'
","A former aide to President Donald Trump has become known for his strong warnings about the threats of Islamic terrorism and Iran. Sebastian Gorka, who left the White House in August, has called on Trump and Congress to withdraw the United States from the nuclear deal it made with Iran. He has said the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps should be listed as a terrorist organization. And, during a speech at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill on Monday, Gorka took it a step further in saying that militant groups like al-Qaida and the Islamic State whose leaders are fundamentalist Sunni Muslims are less dangerous than Iran, led by fundamentalist Shiite Muslims. ""The far larger threat to America is, in fact, Shia jihadism – meaning Iran, and meaning the mullahs. Not the people of Iran or Persians, but the Iranian Republican regime,"" Gorka said. ""Why? … this is a regime which every Friday declares war on us – war and destruction. That America and Israel must be destroyed."" He raised his voice to emphasize ""every Friday."" Do Iran’s leaders declare war on the United States ""every Friday,"" as Gorka suggests? Trump and Iran’s supreme leader have certainly engaged in a war of words recently, with Trump calling a branch of the Iranian armed forces the leader’s ""corrupt personal terror force and militia."" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei jabbed back, telling local media that Trump is ""foul-mouthed"" and ""pretends to be an idiot."" But PolitiFact wondered if it’s possible that Iran has been at war with the United States. (We feel like we would’ve heard about that by now.) We reached out to Gorka by email and Twitter to ask what he meant. He doesn’t appear to elaborate on Iran’s war declarations in a video of the speech posted by the Christians United for Israel Facebook group.  Gorka responded by email after this fact check was published online. ""Is this meant to be a joke?"" he said. ""‘Death to America’ is not a declaration of war? According to your ‘experts?"" he continued. ""Get real experts or just stop wasting my time."" ‘Death to America’ It’s possible – even likely – that Gorka was referring to Iranian officials chanting ""Death to America"" during Friday prayers. This isn’t the first time PolitiFact has looked into the chants of ""Death to America"" by Iranian officials, or the country’s views on America. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2015 claimed that Iran celebrates ""Death to America Day"" every year – a claim we ruled Mostly False. Gary Sick, a scholar at Columbia University’s Middle East Institute, told PolitiFact at the time that the chant ""is shouted every Friday at the weekly prayer services held across Iran."" In fact, experts say some Iranians have been chanting ""Death to America"" in Friday prayers for decades, dating back to the Iran hostage crisis in 1979. As recently as August, the Associated Press reported that members of Iranian parliament chanted it when they voted to increase spending on the country’s ballistic missile program and the foreign operations of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. But experts say the chant isn’t meant to project the country’s intentions to physically harm Americans. Interpreting chants Foad Izadi, an assistant professor in the Faculty of World Studies at the University of Tehran, told Public Radio International in 2015 that the slogan should be interpreted as ""death to American foreign policy."" Iranians ""have problems with the American government, not the American people,"" he said. Kevan Harris, assistant professor at UCLA and author of a book on Iranian politics, agreed: ""To me – and I've been to the ‘revolution day’ parades in Tehran as well as the Friday prayers in University of Tehran where the main political sermoning is given – it is political theater."" Harris compared it to Trump’s claims in August that he’ll unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it continued to threaten the United States. Harris said there are ""lots of Iranian politicians"" who are moderates that favor diplomacy. But often the statements that make American news headlines are from ""some politician in Iran with a megaphone who is trying to outcompete his rivals by saying something scandalous."" Alireza Nader, senior policy analyst for the RAND Corporation, echoed Harris’ view.  ""While hostile, this does not mean Iran is declaring war against the U.S. every Friday,"" Nader said. ""The U.S. and Iran may be rivals, but there is also a history of cooperation between the two as well, including on the nuclear issue."" Declaring war It’s one thing to wish ill of your political enemies. It’s another to formally declare war on another country. Harris, the UCLA professor, says Article 110 of the Iranian constitution gives the powers of war to the supreme leader’s office – which has not declared war on the U.S. ""In reality, Iran's Supreme National Security Council makes decisions on foreign policy -- even Foreign Minister Zarif points this out when he's asked by journalists,"" Harris said.  And PolitiFact couldn't find news reports of the supreme leader declaring war. Could Iran’s actions be interpreted as war? Reza Marashi, research director at the National Iranian American Council, notes that Iranian money and resources are involved in battles across the region.

Greg Abbott makes unconfirmed claims about Texas jobless rate and jobs gained
","It’s commonplace for a governor to tout a state’s economy. Still, Greg Abbott of Texas made us wonder when he tweeted in mid-November 2017: ""The Texas unemployment rate is now the lowest it’s been in 40 years & Texas led the nation last month in new job creation."" Abbott, a Republican seeking re-election in 2018, accompanied his tweet with a campaign video of Abbott smiling at business groundbreakings. The ad flashes headlines about companies opening facilities and adding jobs in Texas. Tagline: ""And we’re just getting started."" We got started fact-checking Abbott’s tweet by asking his office for his backup; we didn’t get a response. In July 2017, Abbott made a Mostly True claim about more Texans having jobs than ever. Yet we noticed that when Abbott tweeted about the state’s jobless rate ""last month,""  October 2017 unemployment rates had yet to be revealed. To get our fix on the latest available data, we fetched Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showing that the state’s impressive 4 percent jobless rate for September 2017 tied the previous record low since 1976. According to the bureau, the state similarly had a 4 percent unemployment rate in November and December 2000, 17 years ago. The state jobless rate in fall 1977, 40 years ago, hovered at 5.2 percent. To our inquiry, a Dallas-based bureau economist, Cheryl Abbot, confirmed our read of monthly seasonally adjusted Texas jobless rates since 1976. Mark J. Perry, who teaches at the University of Michigan-Flint, agreed though Perry, by email, called Abbott’s overstatement on this point ""minor."" Texas Unemployment Rate (Seasonally Adjusted), 1976-September 2017            SOURCE: Website,  ""Local Area Unemployment Statistics,"" Bureau of Labor Statistics, Nov. 16, 2017 (downloaded Nov. 16, 2017) Job gains? By email, the bureau's Abbot showed that Texas didn’t lead the country in job gains for September (again, the latest month of available data). In fact, an October 2017 bureau press release indicates Texas wasn't even among the five states that experienced job gains from August to September 2017. From the release: ""The largest increase in employment occurred in California (+52,200), followed by Washington (+13,800) and Indiana (+11,400). The states also were described as enjoying statistically significant month-to-month gains. ""In percentage terms,"" the bureau said, ""the largest increase occurred in Nebraska (+0.5 percent), followed by Arizona, Indiana, and Washington (+0.4 percent each)."" California had a 0.4 percent gain, the release said. According to a more detailed bureau chart we checked in mid-November 2017, Texas saw a 0.1 percent decrease in jobs from August to September 2017 by going from 12,328,400 jobs to 12,321,100 jobs. The chart indicates 30 states fared better month to month though that folds in five states showing no percentage gains (or losses). There’s a more encouraging longer view. The bureau’s release lists Texas among 28 states with over-the-year increases in nonfarm payroll employment from September 2016 to September 2017. The release said: ""The largest job gains occurred in California (+280,300), Texas (+256,100), and New York (+93,100)--with the largest percentage gains playing out in Nevada and Utah (+2.5 percent each) followed by Maryland (+2.4 percent)."" According to an accompanying chart, Texas and Idaho each saw a 2.1 percent increase in jobs over the year, tying for fourth nationally behind Washington state, which saw a 2.2 percent percentage increase in jobs. Abbot wrote: ""As you can see, the largest monthly increase in jobs in September 2017 occurred in California (+52,200). In percentage terms, Nebraska led among the states with a 0.5-percent gain. California also recorded the largest  over-the-year increase during this period (280,300), followed by Texas (256,100)."" Our ruling Abbott tweeted: ""The Texas unemployment rate is now the lowest it’s been in 40 years & Texas led the nation last month in new job creation."" The latest unemployment data posted when Abbott spoke showed Texas with a 4 percent unemployment rate in September 2017 though that didn't set a 40-year record. Rather, it tied the previous 40-year low set in two months of 2000. Abbott didn’t provide nor did we find data showing jobs created in each state in October 2017. Federal data otherwise indicate that Texas experienced a slight decrease in jobs from August to September 2017 though the state also was home to more jobs than a year earlier.

No, Bowe Bergdahl didn't wander off during court
","Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, held for about five years by the Taliban after disappearing in Afghanistan, has taken off again -- this time during his own court proceeding, says Duffel Blog. ""Bowe Bergdahl wanders off during court-martial,"" said the October headline in Duffel Blog. Here’s the accurate backstory: Bergdahl walked off his remote post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban. The military searched for him, and officers were injured in the process. Bergdahl was freed by his captors in 2014. In return, the United States agreed to turn over five Taliban officials being held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prison to the country of Qatar. President Barack Obama’s controversial decision to exchange Bergdahl angered many Republicans, including then-candidate Donald Trump. The Duffel Blog says that Bergdahl now has walked out of a military courtroom during a pre-trial hearing, prompting a statewide manhunt. ""Sources inside the courtroom say that Bergdahl took only a half-full Camelbak and a long hunting knife with him as he calmly made his way to the exit during his own lawyer’s remarks to the judge regarding a possible plea deal,"" states the article.

He left behind a note, the blog says: ""Life is way too short to care for the damnation of others. I am ashamed to even be an American (deserter)."" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. This story is fake. The article then becomes more ridiculous. It says that a few military personnel were injured in the manhunt and that ""ISIS and Al Qaida have both claimed responsibility for the casualties, though their claims have yet to be verified."" The Pentagon offered a reward for information about Bergdahl’s whereabouts: ""$25,000 or seven Guantanamo detainees, depending on the credibility of the information."" ""Officials are warning the public that if they see Bergdahl, they should not attempt to approach him, since he may try to surrender and become their responsibility for the next five years,"" states the blog. The article linked to an Oct. 12 Washington Post story previewing an upcoming hearing for Bergdahl. Multiple news outlets including the AP reported that Bergdahl entered a plea of guilty during the Oct. 16 hearing at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He didn’t wander off during his hearing. ""I understand that leaving was against the law,"" Bergdahl testified. On Nov. 3, a military judge ordered that Bergdahl receive a dishonorable discharge from the U.S. Army and reduced his rank from sergeant to private.

What impact will eliminating individual mandate have on uninsured, deficit?
","Republican efforts to reverse portions of the Affordable Care Act are not over yet. A few months after failing to pass a bill repealing and replacing the law, some senators are pushing to add a provision to the tax overhaul bill that would repeal the individual mandate, which requires Americans to have health insurance coverage or else pay a tax penalty. While the repeal provision wasn’t in the original version of the bill released by Senate Republican leaders, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said on Twitter he would introduce an amendment to add it. Democratic critics of both the tax bill and the effort to undo the Affordable Care Act pounced on this development. ""Apparently giving a massive tax cut to corporations and the wealthy wasn't enough for the GOP. Now they want to take health care from millions of Americans in order to pay for it,"" tweeted New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat. Apparently giving a massive tax cut to corporations and the wealthy wasn't enough for the GOP. Now they want to take healthcare from millions of Americans in order to pay for it. https://t.co/OKryohGnOq We wondered whether Cuomo was right to say that congressional Republicans ""want to take health care from millions of Americans in order to pay for"" a tax bill. We found his phrasing misses some important points, including this one: Many Americans would be choosing to give up their health insurance if the individual mandate were lifted. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo at a news conference on Nov. 2, 2017. (Jefferson Siegel/New York Daily News/TNS)    In the tweet, Cuomo linked to a story in The Hill newspaper headlined, ""Senate GOP tax bill will include repeal of ObamaCare mandate."" The article supports Cuomo’s assertion that savings from eliminating the individual mandate could help offset lower revenues from tax cuts elsewhere in the bill. The general principle is this: The more money an additional tax bill provision saves for the Treasury, the more tax cuts lawmakers can propose without adding more to the deficit. Getting rid of the mandate ""will raise an estimated $300 billion to $400 billion … that could be used to pay for lowering individual and business tax rates even further,"" The Hill article said. The estimate cited in The Hill story originated with an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan office that studies legislative proposals for Congress. The CBO projected that eliminating the individual mandate would reduce the federal deficit by $338 billion over 10 years. The savings would come from a reduction in subsidy payments for people who currently buy insurance on the law’s online marketplaces but would not do so if the mandate was lifted, and from reductions in Medicaid payments. Collectively, these reductions would more than balance out the loss of penalty payments by uninsured Americans, which CBO projected to be $43 billion in 10 years. Meanwhile, the CBO also projected that 4 million fewer Americans would have health insurance in 2019 as a result of the individual mandate being eliminated, which would rise to 13 million in 2027. Cuomo is putting the cart somewhat before the horse. For starters, the provision is already controversial among some senators, including Susan Collins, R-Maine -- one of the GOP senators who sank the previous repeal-and-replace effort and whose support is widely expected to be crucial for passing the tax bill. And even if a Senate bill that includes the individual mandate repeal does pass, the same language appears unlikely to be in the House bill.  In remarks to CNBC, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that his chamber would not include the provision in the version it takes up on the floor, though he left open the possibility that it could be included in the ""conference committee"" version of the bill that attempts to iron out differences between any bills that pass the House and Senate. The bigger problem, however, is Cuomo saying that the GOP will be taking away people’s coverage. In reality, it’s more complicated than that. Some Americans who are only buying insurance today under threat of the mandate will choose to drop their coverage voluntarily. But if this group is healthier than average, as health care economists say is likely, then the people remaining in the insurance pools would be less healthy — and thus more costly to insure. That would increase premiums, potentially squeezing out some people who, all things considered, would have rather kept their insurance. If the mandate is lifted, no one knows for sure how many people will drop their coverage voluntarily and how many will have their insurance stripped against their will. The CBO figures do not drill down into the reasons that people will be uninsured -- just that they will be uninsured. Here’s CBO’s summary (look at the bottom line).   Christine Eibner, a health policy analyst with the RAND Corp., said it’s ""reasonable"" to argue that the disenrollment from Medicaid would be voluntary, since price would not be a factor for beneficiaries. This would account for 1 million fewer Americans with insurance in 2019 and 5 million fewer in 2027, the bulk of them ""voluntary."" Eibner said it’s harder to guess about disenrollments from the individual market. (The individual market consists of policies purchased outside the employer-provided insurance market.) In previous research, RAND estimated that roughly two-thirds of disenrollment would stem from voluntary choices and one-third would be due to price increases. Other research has put the percentage at about 50-50, said Linda Blumberg, a health policy specialist at the Urban Institute. Cuomo did say ""millions"" rather than specifying CBO’s 13 million figure, and even on the lower end, estimates such as these could well produce ""millions"" of involuntary losses of coverage. But it’s worth remembering that there’s a lot of uncertainty in the numbers. Cuomo said that congressional Republicans ""want to take health care from millions of Americans in order to pay for"" a tax bill. Cuomo has a point that Republicans would be able to increase the size of their tax cuts if they could count on a projected $338 billion in added revenue over 10 years, and ending the individual mandate would result in an estimated 13 million fewer Americans with health coverage by 2027. However, it’s worth pointing out that ending the individual mandate isn’t the same thing as stripping away health insurance away for a large number of Americans. While some would lose access to health insurance due to increased premiums, many others would drop their coverage voluntarily.

Do Californians pay the ‘highest electricity bills’ in the nation?
","Californians pay a premium to live in the Golden State. Our housing costs are astronomical, gas prices are the highest in the nation and many state taxes are at or near the top. In a recent interview on Capital Public Radio, Republican candidate for governor John Cox said he wants to reduce the financial strain on Californians. ""The state has been rendered unaffordable by the politicians in Sacramento. It’s got the worst business climate in the nation. We’re a laughing stock. And I want to change that,"" Cox, a San Diego businessman, said in the interview conducted Oct. 21, 2017. Cox cited several of the state’s high costs from housing to gas prices. We fact-checked those in a related article. He went on to say, however, that Californians also pay ""the highest electricity bills"" in the country. California, the center of the nation’s solar industry, is known for both producing and consuming huge amounts of electricity. But do we also pay the most on our electricity bills? We decided to shine a light on this claim. Our research California has the nation’s sixth highest retail price of electricity in the residential sector, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which provides independent analysis of energy data. So, one might assume with this high cost Californians also pay more than most states on their bills. In fact, it’s just the opposite, at least for two key sectors.   California’s average residential monthly electricity bill in 2016 was $95.20, or less expensive than 39 other states, according to EIA data. Nationwide, the average bill was $112.59 per month. Meanwhile, the state’s average industrial monthly electricity bill was $3,408, or 42nd in the nation. That was about half the national average. California’s average commercial monthly electricity bill was $866, or fifth highest in the nation, much closer to the top, but by no means ""the highest."" ""California has some of the highest rates, but they also have some of the lowest consumption per customer, so they have lower bills than most states,"" said Marc Hanish, an EIA expert on state electricity profiles. Indeed, California ranks 49th in the nation in per capita electricity consumption. Hanish said that’s driven both by high prices and by the state’s strong commitment to energy efficient buildings and appliances. Cox’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Our ruling Candidate for governor John Cox recently claimed California has ""the highest electricity bills"" in the country. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows California’s average monthly electricity bills in 2016 ranked far below the national average, particularly in the residential and industrial sectors. They were 40th and 42nd, respectively. The state’s average monthly commercial electricity bills were more expensive, at fifth highest, though still not ""the highest"" as Cox claimed. California’s electricity prices are more expensive than in many states. Customers in the state, however, consume far less electricity than the national average, which drives down the cost of bills. Even if Cox had claimed California had the highest electricity rates, he would still be off the mark. Cox’s campaign offered no evidence to back up his claim. We rate it False.

Did court find no indication of terrorism from seven nations in Trump order?
","During an appearance on ABC’s This Week, White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller took aim at court rulings temporarily halting the implementation of the Trump administration’s executive order on immigration. Several states have sued the Trump administration over its executive order that temporarily blocks immigration and travel from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa. A federal trial court judge in Seattle ruled on Feb. 3 that the federal government could not enforce the executive order while the case is pending. So lawyers for the administration appealed that decision to the 9th Circuit, which hears cases from most of the western United States. On Feb. 9, a panel of three judges ruled unanimously to affirm the Seattle judge’s decision. (The court didn’t rule on whether the executive order is legal. That will happen later.) On the Feb. 12, 2017, edition of This Week, host George Stephanopoulos asked Miller whether he was ""calling into question the legitimacy"" of the judges who ruled on the case. Miller responded, ""I'm calling into question the accuracy of the ruling. For instance, the district judge in Seattle said that there was no indication of terrorism from these seven countries and our country. That is a factually false statement."" Miller went on to say that ""there’s at least several dozen -- perhaps many more than that -- cases of terrorism from these countries that have happened in the United States in terms of terroristic plots, terroristic activity, material support for terrorism, supporting terrorism overseas, all different kinds of terroristic activity that's been interdicted in the United States tracing back to these seven countries."" This data appears to come from a report by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that is generally critical of high levels of immigration. On Feb. 11, 2017, after the hearing, the center released a report titled, ""Study Reveals 72 Terrorists Came From Countries Covered by Trump Vetting Order."" Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker analyzed the report and concluded that it was ""pretty thin gruel on which to make sweeping claims about the alleged threat posed to the United States by these seven countries,"" because many of the cases involved charges removed from actual terrorism, such as ""passport fraud, visa fraud and making fraudulent claims to federal investigators,"" and because about two dozen people on the list ""were not charged with any crimes relating to providing material support to known or suspected terrorist activities or organizations."" The Fact Checker gave it Three Pinocchios, the column’s second-worst rating. We won’t analyze the Center for Immigration Studies report, because we found a more fundamental concern with Miller’s comment, regardless of whether the center’s report is fully accurate and relevant. It involves this part of Miller’s statement: ""I'm calling into question the accuracy of the ruling. The district judge in Seattle said there was no indication of terrorism from these seven countries in our country."" When we looked at the ruling by U.S. District Court Judge James L. Robart, we found no such assertion by the judge. However, Jessica M. Vaughan, the author of the Center for Immigration Studies report, pointed to something else -- the oral argument before the district court judge. Here’s the relevant portion of the oral argument: JUDGE JAMES ROBART: ""How many arrests have there been of foreign nationals for those seven countries since 9/11?"" GOVERNMENT LAWYER MICHELLE BENNETT: ""Your honor, I don't have that information. I'm from the Civil Division if that -- if that helps get me off the hook any."" (Laughter) ROBART: ""Well, let me tell you. The answer to that is none, as best I can tell. So, I mean, you know, you're here arguing on behalf of someone that says we have to protect the United States from these individuals coming from these countries, and there's no support for that."" BENNETT: ""Your honor, I think the point is that because this is a question of foreign affairs, because this is an area where Congress has delegated authority to the president to make these determinations, it's the president that gets to make the determinations. And the court doesn't have authority to look behind those determinations."" Assuming this is what Miller was referring to -- and the White House did not clarify the point for PolitiFact -- then he has a point. But it did not come in the ruling, contrary to what Miller indicated. Rather, it was made in an oral argument -- a less salient piece of evidence, legal experts said. ""Ordinarily, one would look to the opinion rather than an exchange in oral argument because opinions have legal effect and statements in oral argument don't,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. Roosevelt added that it’s not unheard of for a judge to reconsider a statement they had made during an oral argument and decide to leave it out while drafting the opinion. In the meantime, by focusing on the district court judge’s comment, Miller glosses over the fact that the appeals court -- which unanimously upheld the lower court’s decision to put the administration’s executive order on hold  -- stated a conflicting view. Here’s the relevant portion of the appeals court’ ruling: ""The Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States. Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the Government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all. We disagree, as explained above."" The three-judge panel reinforced this point with a footnote: ""Although the Government points to the fact that Congress and the Executive identified the seven countries named in the Executive Order as countries of concern in 2015 and 2016, the Government has not offered any evidence or even an explanation of how the national security concerns that justified those designations, which triggered visa requirements, can be extrapolated to justify an urgent need for the Executive Order to be immediately reinstated."" These passages didn't affirmatively state that there was ""no indication of terrorism,"" as Miller said, but rather that the government didn't present any such evidence. This may seem like a fine distinction, but it's an important one, according to legal scholars. ""The court is saying that the government has given it no evidence -- not that no evidence exists, or that it’s conducted its own search for evidence and found none,"" Roosevelt said. ""Generally speaking, courts rely on parties to produce the evidence."" Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a Cornell University law professor who specializes in immigration, agreed that this interpretation was ""perfectly reasonable."" ""The 9th Circuit panel merely said that the administration didn’t present evidence of terrorism, not that they ruled that no terrorism had occurred,"" he said. Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said our interpretation was ""fair,"" though he added that it was ""beside the point."" As it defended against the lawsuits, Shapiro said, the government argued that ""it doesn’t need to show evidence -- that courts are supposed to defer to executive judgments on national security."" Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies suggested that the appeals court seemed to be ""trying to cover for Judge Robart ... by restating his erroneous idea in a narrower way."" But Yale-Loehr and Roosevelt both told PolitiFact that the omissions are notable. Roosevelt said he found it ""troubling"" that Miller seemed to imply that the judge ""made a mistake of fact that has consequences for the soundness of the decision, without acknowledging that it was the government's obligation to provide the correct facts, and in fact the judge started out by asking for those facts."" Our ruling Miller said, ""I'm calling into question the accuracy of the ruling. The district judge in Seattle said there was no indication of terrorism from these seven countries in our country."" Miller's comments seemed to reference the ruling -- the only part of the case record with legal authority. But no such statement was included in the ruling. And while the judge did make a comment along those lines during oral arguments, citing this ignores a contradictory claim in the appeals court ruling. We rate Miller’s statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/af06f1e4-cf49-4b8d-8895-27c8cc3f0cd6",/factchecks/2017/feb/14/stephen-miller/did-court-find-no-indication-terrorism-seven/

No, food waste is not the third biggest source of greenhouse gases
","As it struggles to feed the hungry, the U.N. World Food Program often reminds the public that in the face of great need, there is also great waste. Right now, the U.N. relief agency is active in about 75 nations, including conflict zones in Syria, Iraq, Nigeria and South Sudan. In a tweet, the World Food Program connected the loss of food to global climate change. ""Food waste is the 3rd largest contributor of GHGs (greenhouse gases) to our climate,"" the organization tweeted Feb. 5, 2017. The tweet no longer exists. The program deleted it after we raised some questions, so kudos for that. Here’s why it was inaccurate. World Food Program senior spokesman Steve Taravella told us they relied on a report from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. That article included a chart that said, ""If food wastage were a country, it would be the third largest emitting country in the world."" FAO researchers estimated that a third of all food never makes it to the kitchen table and calculated the emissions that went in to growing and transporting those wasted tons.  The problem is, agriculture is an activity, not a place. It makes sense to compare its emissions to other activities, and no sense to rank it against countries. ""It's comparing apples to oranges,"" researcher Brian Lipinski at the World Resources Institute told us. ""The number for food loss and waste is comprised of numbers from individual countries, and so the data isn't mutually exclusive. So while the comparison to countries helps to establish the scale, flat-out labeling food loss and waste as the world's third largest emitter is missing necessary context."" When we raised this issue with Taravella, he agreed. ""In our effort to illustrate the scale of the problem, it seems we inadvertently mistook the metaphor in the graphic — a mythical country — for an actual source of waste,"" Taravella said. He deleted the tweet to ""avoid giving our Twitter followers inaccurate data,"" and told us he would take this up with his colleagues to find other ways to draw attention to food waste. So how do emissions from food lost and wasted stack up against other human activities? The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated total greenhouse gas emissions to be equal to 49.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Out of that, agriculture, forestry and other productive uses of land account for about 25 percent. Food waste is about 9 percent, but that’s not a separate piece all by itself. Emissions tied to industry (the production of fertilizer), transportation (moving food around), buildings (to store food), energy (to refrigerate it), and agriculture all contribute a bit to the food waste total. The current research doesn’t tease out emissions due to food waste separate from other activities, so there’s no way to rank it by itself. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimated that food loss and waste accounted for about 4.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide each year. That’s a little bit less than emissions from road transportation. A research group at Potsdam University in Germany used very different methods and reached a similar conclusion on the total emissions tied to wasted food. Our ruling The World Food Program tweeted that food waste is the third largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. That is based on a comparison to the emissions of other countries, but food waste is an activity, not a place. The World Food Programme acknowledged that it took a point used for rhetorical effect and treated it literally. The organization deleted the tweet. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d10247d9-2da2-4b9d-9066-ebc6521196eb",/factchecks/2017/feb/14/world-food-program/no-food-waste-not-third-biggest-source-greenhouse-/

Arkansas senator says of 1 million green cards issued, few are employment-based
","Republican Sen. Tom Cotton favors a new legal immigration system that’s less focused on extended family reunification and more aligned with bringing in skilled workers. Cotton, of Arkansas, contended on Fox News that of 1 million green cards issued annually, very few are employment-based. ""Right now we have a legal immigration system that is not working for American workers. Blue-collar workers, people who work with their hands, on their feet, have seen their wages stagnate for decades,"" Cotton said Feb. 7 on Fox News. ""At the same time, we’ve seen record levels of immigration in recent decades. A million green cards a year, the population of Montana added to this country every year, population of Arkansas added every year, almost none of those green cards are based on job skills or demonstrated economic need. So, of course they compete for blue-collar jobs and put downward pressure on working-class wages."" There’s a lot of debate about the role immigrants play in the workforce and how they impact wages. For this fact-check, we were curious about Cotton’s claim that almost none of the 1 million green cards issued each year are based on skills or economic need. Data from the Department of Homeland Security supports his claim. Cotton filed a bill Feb. 13 to reduce the number of family-sponsored immigrants, to eliminate the Diversity Visa Program, and to limit the president’s discretion for setting the number of refugees admitted each year, among other things. Cotton’s bill parallels one of President Donald Trump’s campaign promises to reform and limit legal immigration. 1 million green cards The Immigration and Naturalization Act allows for 675,000 legal immigrant admissions a year, but that number is flexible, and certain categories for legal permanent resident are exceeded, says a 2014 Congressional Research Service report. Admission preferences, according to the report, include: family-sponsored immigrants (about 480,000); employment-based preference immigrants (about 140,000); and diversity visa lottery immigrants (55,000). Refugees and asylum seekers who are adjusting their status are excluded from limit counts, the report said. As Cotton said, the United States issues about 1 million green cards a year, allowing recipients to permanently live and work in the United States. The majority of people who become legal permanent residents annually already live in the country and receive their green card as a result of an adjustment of status. The rest are new arrivals. The majority of green cards, about two-thirds, are given to individuals who have a family relationship with a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident in the United States, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, in a 2013 post said the employment rate for family-based immigrants is 54 percent, excluding parents and minor children of U.S. citizens who are less likely to be of working age. Caroline Rabbitt, Cotton’s communications director, told us that when speaking about legal immigration reform, Cotton typically says only 1 out of every 15 immigrants come to the United States on a skills or employment-based visa and that his statement of ""almost none"" on Fox News was a modified turn of phrase. ""Only 1 out of every 15 immigrant is coming here for employment reasons. If we really needed all of these people because of their skills, because they help the economy grow, they’d be coming here on say an EB1 or EB2 visa, but they are not,"" Cotton said in a press conference Feb. 7, the same day of his Fox News interview, as he presented his new legislation. Rabbitt presented us with a table noting the total number of green cards issued a year and the number and percentage of those that were skills-based (from 2001 to 2015). The calculations exclude green cards given to accompanying spouses and minor children. Nowrasteh, from the Cato Institute, told us it’s fair to exclude spouses and children in this tabulation, ""after all, they aren’t the ones who are supposed to work and they could have any level of skill, although the spouses are usually highly skilled."" On average, 6.73 percent of green cards issued went to someone who came to the United States because of their skills, based on Cotton’s calculation using DHS data. That’s on par with a similar 2013 claim from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who then said 6.5 percent of immigrants come here based on labor and skill. Rubio’s statement was based on a 2011 policy brief from the Brookings Institution. The report was the best approximation of conflicting numbers, the brief’s author, Darrell West, told us then. (More on how he derived at 6.5 percent here.) West, who is vice president and director of Governance Studies and director of the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings Institution, told PolitiFact that individuals coming in through family connections also work, pay taxes and contribute to the overall economy. ""Focusing just on those who enter through employment-based preferences ignores the economic contributions of other visa categories,"" West said, adding that many immigrants work in areas where there are employee shortages. The employment-based preference includes people adjusting their status and new arrivals and who fall under five categories, such as individuals with extraordinary abilities, professionals with advanced degrees and religious workers. ""Needed unskilled workers"" also falls within the employment-based preference for green cards. Our ruling Cotton said that of 1 million green cards issued a year, ""almost none of those green cards are based on job skills or demonstrated economic needs."" Cotton’s team told us the senator usually says one out of 15 green card recipients (about 6.7 percent) come to the United States for employment reasons. That estimate checks out with data from the Department of Homeland Security. But experts say focusing just on the employment category overlooks individuals who are also contributing to the economy, though they may have come under a different visa category. Cotton’s statement is accurate, but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/feb/14/tom-cotton/arkansas-senator-says-1-million-green-cards-issue-/

Border fence in Israel cut illegal immigration by 99 percent, GOP senator says
","Need an example of a border wall that works? Look to Israel, President Donald Trump has repeatedly said. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., echoed the idea during a Feb. 3 CNN interview, claiming that a border fence in Israel has drastically cut illegal immigration along its southern border. ""Israel ... had a real problem with illegal immigrants coming in from the southern border, about 16,000 in one year. In two years, they constructed 143-mile fence, about $2.9 million per mile, and it cut that illegal immigration rate from about 16,000 to I think 18. Cut it by 99 percent,"" Johnson said. The United States needs to pay attention to Israel and how it has handled security issues, Johnson said. ""They are under a constant state of threat. Threat of terrorism. They've dealt with it pretty effectively. We need to learn those lessons,"" Johnson added. Since Trump has signed an executive order to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, we were curious about references to Israel’s border efforts and their success, as described by Johnson. Here’s what we found. Israel-Egypt border fence Israel has built multiple barriers along its borders with Egypt, Lebanon, Gaza Strip and West Bank, all as safeguards against terrorism and illegal immigration. In 2015, we looked into a claim from another Wisconsin official, Gov. Scott Walker, when he said that a 500-mile fence between Israel and the West Bank was to thank for a 90 percent reduction in terrorist attacks in Israel. Experts then told us that even though there had been a drop in terrorism, the data used for Walker’s analysis was outdated and the fence was only one reason for the decline. Johnson was specifically talking about a fence along the Israeli-Egyptian border. Johnson’s team referred us to a January 2013 article in the Jerusalem Post about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu touring a completed 143-mile fence along the Sinai border. The article noted that an additional 8 miles of fencing was still to be completed along mountainous terrain near Eilat. When fully completed, the fence would run from Kerem Shalom (where Sinai and Israel meet the Gaza Strip) to Taba on the Red Sea, according to the article. Fence construction started in November 2010 and came with a price tag of 1.6 billion Israeli shekels, the Jerusalem Post reported. The senator's office said an Israeli official told Johnson that the fence cost $415 million during a tour while Johnson was in Israel. (The Wall Street Journal in January 2013 pegged the fence’s cost at $416 million.) To determine a $2.9 million cost per mile, Johnson divided $415 million into the 143 completed miles cited in the 2013 article. (The cost per mile goes down to about $2.7 million when factoring in the total project of about 150 miles.) So Johnson appears largely correct about the cost of the wall. How about its success in keeping people trying to cross the border illegally out? That number checks out, too. This month, Johnson, who chairs the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, released a report titled ""Securing Israel: Lessons learned from a nation under constant threat of attack."" The report came after a trip Johnson made to Israel where he met the Israeli prime minister and other security officials. The report notes that the number of people illegally crossing the Israel-Egypt border was more than 16,000 in 2011 and less than 20 in 2016, a 99 percent decrease. Netanyahu recently touted his country’s southern barrier and gave a nod to Trump, tweeting on Jan. 28, ""President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea."" President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea 🇮🇱🇺🇸 Experts we reached out to agree that illegal immigration along Egypt’s southern border has indeed significantly dropped in the years after the fence was built and that Johnson's assessment of its costs and timeframe are sound. However, they warn against generalizing that the fence is the sole reason for the drop and raise objections in comparing Israel’s border issues to those in the United States. The success of barriers such as a wall or fence depend on their scale and how heavily guarded they are, said Reece Jones, a political geography professor at the University of Hawai'i-Manoa and who has written about money spent on border security projects and their consequences. On a small scale and with many guards, walls can effectively stop movement, Jones said. But Israel and the United States’ southern borders are significantly different. The Israel-Egypt border fence is about 150 miles. The U.S.-Mexico border is nearly 2,000 miles. Terrain conditions and number of agents needed to monitor the border are not comparable either, Jones said. ""Most of the Israeli fence goes through open, arid terrain. Easy to access, easy to build, easy to monitor with agents,"" Jones said. The U.S.-Mexico border, on the other hand, includes very remote, mountainous terrain and spans the length of four states with cities closely intertwined with Mexico. Trump has said that border has 1 million legal border crossings daily, which experts have told us include people traveling back and forth for school, work and shopping. Investment in high-tech features such as drones, robots and sensors is also crucial for border security, not just fences, added Elisabeth Vallet, who leads a research team on border walls and is Raoul-Dandurand Chair at the University of Quebec at Montreal. Without those features, people may still go undetected or go around through another border. If illegal entries surge at another border point, then the effectiveness of the fence at one border comes into question, Vallet said. ""While the numbers show a dramatic decrease in the number of entries, the amount of credit attributed to the fence is an issue of serious debate in Israel,"" said Yonatan Jakubowicz, director of research and public relations at the Israeli Immigration Policy Center, an NGO in Israel. Some were skeptical about the fence’s effectiveness when the idea was introduced in 2009, but the barrier received wider support after a terrorist attack on the border road in August 2011, Jakubowicz said. He also said that aside from the fence, additional policies have reduced illegal immigration. The number of illegal border crossings decreased drastically ""in an extremely short time"" after the implementation of an ""Anti-Infiltration Law"" in mid 2012, Jakubowicz said.   Under the law, individuals caught illegally entering Israel could be detained for up to three years, Jakubowicz said. The number of people illegally crossing Israel’s southern border decreased after the law came into effect, even though the fence was not fully completed, he said. ""The fact that people continued to arrive even after the total completion of the fence, with fluctuations, proves that a barrier makes illegal migration more difficult, but not impossible,"" Jakubowicz said. ""Personal interviews and close inspection of migrant diaspora news outlets show that the combination of the fence and the immigration policies are to be attributed to these numbers, and not the fence alone."" Our ruling Johnson said Israel cut its illegal immigration rate by ""99 percent"" by constructing a 143-mile fence along its southern border. Israeli government data support Johnson’s statement. However, experts say the fence alone is not responsible for the dramatic decrease in illegal immigration, policies have also deterred illegal border crossings. Border security experts also caution about comparing Israel and the United States’ southern borders -- the U.S.-Mexico border is much longer than the Israel-Egypt border, terrain conditions are different and more agents would be needed to monitor the U.S. border. Johnson’s statement is accurate, but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/feb/13/ron-johnson/border-fence-israel-cut-illegal-immigration-99-per/

Idaho woman was not sentenced to prison for breastfeeding her child
","A fabricated story that says an Idaho mother was imprisoned for breastfeeding her child continues to be persistently shared online, despite being completely made up. ""Idaho mother sentenced to prison after multiple citations for breastfeeding in public,"" reads the headline on a Sept. 3, 2016, post on TheSeattleTribune.com, which sometimes is shared with an AssociatedMediaCoverage.com url. Even though the story is months old, it continues to be shared widely on Facebook, which flagged it as part of its efforts to combat fake news. The story — which again, is not true — says that 32-year-old Heather Watson of Baker County, Idaho, was sentenced to seven years in prison and will have to register as a sex offender for breastfeeding her 6-month-old daughter in public. The post said Watson had received six citations for indecent exposure before landing in prison. There is no outward indication the story is fake, but several clues should tip off readers this is a work of fiction. There are no other news reports of this incident, beyond blog posts from incensed mothers. There also is no record of a Heather Watson at the Idaho Department of Correction offender search. (We doubt the story is about the British tennis player of the same name.) The main photo used on the story is from a 2014 post on a Flickr account, with a chyron added to make it look like a screen grab from TV news. The inset mug is of a woman arrested in Maricopa County, Ariz., in 2016. Another giveaway is the location mentioned in the story: There is no Baker County in Idaho. There’s further reference to a location called Wiser, Idaho, but the town is spelled Weiser, and it’s in Washington County. There’s also a phone number given as a way to contact the judge in the case at the fictional Baker County Department of Justice. When called, the phone number identifies itself as a voicemail service for the controversial Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan. The story likely keys off Idaho’s distinction as being the only state without a law specifically defending breastfeeding in public (although there is a law excusing nursing mothers from jury duty). The post links to a MoveOn.org petition supporting a new law, and there is a graphic illustrating where in the United States it is legal to breastfeed in public, taken from a 2014 Huffington Post article. Many Idahoans support a new law protecting mothers from being kicked out of businesses or charged with public indecency. The state reportedly has a higher rate of breastfeeding mothers than any other state. In 2016, Miss Idaho America Christi Van Ravenhorst teamed up with a group called the Idaho Breastfeeding Law Coalition to push for a bill, and mothers staged a ""nurse-in"" on the steps of the state Capitol.

Donald Trump says refugee admissions surged from 7 countries during suspension of executive order
","President Donald Trump said refugees from dangerous locations have flooded the United States ever since a federal judge halted his executive order. ""72% of refugees admitted into U.S. (2/3 -2/11) during COURT BREAKDOWN are from 7 countries: SYRIA, IRAQ, SOMALIA, IRAN, SUDAN, LIBYA & YEMEN,"" Trump said on Twitter Feb. 12. 72% of refugees admitted into U.S. (2/3 -2/11) during COURT BREAKDOWN are from 7 countries: SYRIA, IRAQ, SOMALIA, IRAN, SUDAN, LIBYA & YEMEN Trump has a point that almost three-quarters of refugees entering the United States in that period are from countries targeted in his immigration ban. This might be explained by the turbulent situations that drive refugees from their homes and the on-again, off-again travel ban placed on refugees. It's also important to remember the pool of refugees we're talking about is about 1,400 people. Trump’s data comes from information maintained by the State Department’s Refugee Processing Center. The center has an interactive tool that allows the data on admissions to be sifted by country and date. From Feb. 3 to Feb. 11, the percentage of refugees arriving from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen was about 72 percent or 1,049 out of 1,462. (Judge James L. Robart of Federal District Court in Seattle blocked the order on Feb. 3, a decision upheld on appeal.) Here’s a breakdown of arrivals by country:   The majority of refugee admissions were from Syria and Iraq, followed by Somalia and Iran and then 37 Sudanese refugees. No refugees were recorded from Libya and Yemen. The makeup of refugees entering the United States looked a little different after Trump’s first day as president Jan. 20. Basically, there were more refugees arriving from other countries. In the week before his Jan. 27 order, the United States processed 2,108 refugees. The percentage of refugees from the seven countries in the order was lower, but 44 percent (as opposed to 72 percent) were were from those seven countries.  The number of refugees entering the United States from the seven countries targeted in the order has steadily increased since Feb. 3, while the refugee arrivals from countries not affected by the order has fallen, according to data from the Refugee Processing Center. On Feb. 11, Trump tweeted ""Our legal system is broken!"" and cited a report in the Washington Times showing that 77 percent of the refugees who entered the United States since had been from the seven ""suspect countries."" Our ruling Trump said that 72 percent of the refugees admitted into United States between Feb. 3 and Feb. 11 were from seven countries his executive order targets. According to the Refugee Processing Center, of the 1,462 refugees entering the United States between that time frame, roughly 72 percent were from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Syria and Sudan. No refugees were from Libya and Yemen.

White House senior adviser repeats baseless claim about busing illegal voters in New Hampshire
","President Donald Trump won the election but he lost New Hampshire, a fact he has tried to explain by arguing that liberal voters from Massachusetts crossed into New Hampshire to cast their vote against him. Trump floated the alleged Massachusetts-to-New Hampshire busing activity earlier in the week in a private meeting with 10 senators about Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, according to media reports. Trump and former Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is helping Gorsuch through the confirmation process, both lost their races in the Granite State to Democrats. ABC’s George Stephanopoulos repeatedly pressed Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller for evidence for Trump’s statement multiple times in a Feb. 12 interview on This Week. ""I’ve actually, having worked before on a campaign in New Hampshire, I can tell you that this issue of busing voters in to New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who’s worked in New Hampshire politics. It’s very real, it’s very serious,"" Miller said. ""This morning on this show is not the venue for me lay out all the evidence."" Miller went on to talk about the administration’s issue with people who are registered to vote in two states or illegal voters on voter rolls, repeating false talking points and never bringing up evidence to back up the administration’s claim about a pipeline of bused-in voters in New Hampshire. (The White House did not provide evidence to back up the busing claim after Miller’s interview and instead pointed to a 2014 editorial about the need for voter ID laws that did not mention busing.) We searched widely, as have others, and failed to find any evidence corroborating Miller and Trump’s claim. Fergus Cullen, who ran the New Hampshire Republican Party from 2007-08, said the stories about voters coming over from Massachusetts are as old as ""the invention of the bus."" What fuels the concern is New Hampshire’s same-day voter registration law, even though it was adopted in the 1990s with strong Republican support to avoid the federal government’s ""motor voter law,"" which allows people to register to vote at their DMV. ""The result is that yes, it is possible and legal for someone to drive into a polling place in a car with out-of-state tags, register to vote, and vote,"" Cullen told PolitiFact. ""Of course they have to sign affidavits and they would be risking significant legal penalties if they voted in more than one place or state. The odds of being caught are pretty high."" He said the same theory was going around in New Hampshire in 2012, an election where Massachusetts Democrats were supporting Elizabeth Warren against incumbent Sen. Scott Brown. Adding more fuel to the talking point is that some Massachusetts residents do go to New Hampshire to help with that state’s closer elections, said Dante Scala, a University of New Hampshire political scientist who has written books and articles about the state’s elections over 15 years. ""So it certainly is possible on election day people from Massachusetts come north to work on the election itself,"" he said, ""but that’s a far cry from proving that they vote here."" Miller’s claim has been analyzed by our colleagues at PolitiFact New Hampshire, who found no evidence busing exists. They rated a similar claim about Massachusetts residents boarding buses to vote in New Hampshire Pants on Fire. Chris Sununu, who won his bid for New Hampshire governor Nov. 8, warned ahead of the election that Democrats would bus in Massachusetts voters in places where elections are not close and assign them a fake address to apply for same-day voter registration in New Hampshire. That statement, like Miller’s, was flawed. Aside from one to two cases per election, the top state elections official said widespread voter fraud is not a problem. ""I have no basis to say it’s rampant, and there are ways we can deal with it,"" New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner said in an interview with PolitiFact New Hampshire. New Hampshire law requires voters to provide IDs at the polls. Without a proper ID there are added barriers and questions, as the voters sign a sworn affidavit with their address and get their photo taken. After the election, the state sends confirmation letters to those addresses to confirm identities. Letters that are returned as undeliverable are investigated. In Sununu’s case, he eventually walked back much of his argument, saying he wasn’t talking about literal buses of voters crossing into the state; rather it was a ""figure of speech that people are coming over, they’re temporarily here, they vote and then they leave."" The incident he had in mind was, he said, of Portsmouth state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark letting Democratic staffers live at her house during the 2008 and 2012 elections. The staffers voted in New Hampshire, using her address — but that wasn’t illegal, the state attorney general concluded, because they had lived in the state for at least three months before the election. After Trump’s November victory, he continued to make claims of ""serious voter fraud"" in New Hampshire, Virginia or California. The claims rated Pants on Fire, Pants on Fire, and Pants on Fire. PolitiFact New Hampshire, in particular, talked to several state and local officials about whether anything fishy occurred Nov. 8. Nashua City Clerk Tricia Piecuch, who works in the state’s second-largest city on the border with Massachusetts, said nothing out of the ordinary went down. Officials in the Secretary of State’s office, Attorney General’s office and U.S. Attorney’s office all reported no complaints of voter fraud in the 2016 election. ""We have never gotten any proof about buses showing up at polling places,"" Gardner, a Democrat, told The Boston Globe. ""It’s not in a private place. It’s a public place."" In response to reports about Trump’s meeting with senators, FEC Commissioner Ellen L. Weintraub called on the president to ""immediately share his evidence with the public and with the appropriate law-enforcement authorities so that his allegations may be investigated promptly and thorougly."" ""The president has issued an extraordinarily serious and specific charge,"" Weintraub wrote Feb. 10. ""Allegations of this magnitude cannot be ignored."" Our ruling A top adviser to Trump said people were bused into New Hampshire as part of an elaborate voting fraud scheme. However, there is no evidence this occurs, and Republicans and Democrats in New Hampshire say it does not. Trump and his White House have been asked multiple times to provide evidence but have not.

","President Donald Trump has repeatedly labeled CNN as ""fake news,"" but is it true that Sen. Bernie Sanders agrees with him? That was the message from Trump in an early-morning Twitter take. ""While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network,"" Trump tweeted Feb. 12. ""They said technical difficulties."" While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network. They said technical difficulties! Trump is referring to CNN’s Erin Burnett’s interview with Sanders, I-Vt., on Feb. 10, a few days before his tweet. Trump’s tweet, however, mischaracterized the reality of the Sanders-Burnett exchange. His tweet echoes a post on InfoWars, a website that pushes conspiracy theories. Here’s what actually happened. Sanders and Burnett were discussing the news that Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn called the Russian ambassador to the United States before the inauguration to discuss easing sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama in retaliation for interference in the election. Vice President Mike Pence and other Trump officials had said in media interviews that Flynn did not discuss the sanctions with Sergey Kislyak. A minute into the interview, Burnett played a clip of Trump responding to reporters’ questions on his plane about Flynn’s comments. Trump said, ""I don't know about that, I haven't seen it. What report is that? I haven't seen that, I'll look at that."" After the clip, Burnett asked Sanders if it’s a ""problem"" that the president hasn’t seen the report. That’s when Sanders actually criticized Trump for his tendency to dismiss news outlets’ negative reports as fake news. Here’s the back-and-forth: Burnett: ""He says he knows nothing about it, hasn't seen any of these reports. Is that a problem?"" Sanders: ""Well, I don't know, maybe he was watching CNN fake news, what do you think?"" Burnett: ""You don't buy it?"" Sanders: ""That was a joke."" Burnett: ""I know it was a joke. I'm saying, you don't buy what he said, obviously?"" Sanders’ audio cut out after Burnett acknowledged the joke, so CNN cut to commercial break. ""It looks like we've lost connection with Senator Sanders,"" Burnett said. ""So let's just try to get that back up. Do we have him back? OK. So what we're going to do is take a break, I don't want to waste our time, we only have the senator for a few minutes, we're going to take a break, we're going to come back and continue our conversation with Senator Sanders."" Burnett picked up the interview after the break, going on for nine more minutes to ask Sanders about the administration’s contentious travel ban, the Republican plans to replace the Affordable Care Act and Trump’s attacks on Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. CNN reporters including Brian Stelter and Jake Tapper also shot back at Trump’s tweet misrepresenting the exchange. Untrue. Sanders was *criticizing Trump* for calling CNN ""fake news."" You can see for yourself, all 11 minutes, here: https://t.co/qhtlb5Wo6Q https://t.co/AcwOiNHi0j From Michael Briggs, Senator Sanders’ Communications Director: “The Senator was clearly joking” https://t.co/OzMj8pkTlv Our ruling Trump tweeted, ""While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network. They said technical difficulties!"" Trump’s tweet distorted what happened when Sanders brought up ""fake news"" on CNN.  Sanders was actually criticizing Trump’s repeated outcries that CNN is a fake news source. His audio did go out after this joke, but the CNN host picked up the interview after a commercial break for about nine more minutes. Trump gave the inaccurate impression that Sanders was booted for calling CNN ""fake news."" That’s not what happened.

Police assaults in New York have decreased in recent years
","A bipartisan push in Albany would classify offenses against first responders and law enforcement officers as hate crimes. The Community Heroes Protection Act would also toughen the sentences for those convicted. State Sen. Martin J. Golden, a Republican from Brooklyn and co-sponsor of the bill, said the number of assaults on police officers in New York state should convince his colleagues to support the effort. ""The numbers show this law is definitely needed,"" Golden said. ""Just last year, alone, 710 police officers - this is just police officers - were assaulted in this state."" Is Golden right? Were that many police officers assaulted last year? Data from the FBI The Federal Bureau of Investigation has reported the number of law enforcement officers killed and assaulted in the United States since 1972. The FBI defines a law enforcement officer as a local, state, and federal public authority who ordinarily carries a badge and a firearm. The report does not include attacks on correctional officers or emergency responders, though they are included in the proposed legislation. The bureau reported 710 assaults on New York state law enforcement officers in 2015, the latest data available. That’s the lowest number since 2007, when 656 officers were assaulted.  The FBI's New York state number, however, is not a statewide figure. It only includes assaults on law enforcement officers outside New York City. The agency said it does not have data for reported assaults on law enforcement officers in New York City. Data from the NYPD The New York City Police Department reports its own data on police assaults, but it defines officers more broadly. The Police Department tracks assaults on police officers, peace officers, prosecutors, nurses, sanitation workers, firefighters, paramedics, city marshals, school crossing guards, traffic agents and emergency responders. The department said it does not report solely the number of assaults on law enforcement officers. Last year the department reported 1,632  assaults on people within the department's definition. That’s down from 2015, when 1,738 assaults were reported. Our ruling Golden said,  ""Just last year alone, 710 police officers … were assaulted in this state."" Golden relied on FBI data that does not include assaults on officers from New York City. Golden undercounted, but his point is not lost: The number of reported assaults on law enforcement officers is significant. His statement needs clarification and additional information.

Labor leader says minimum-wage workers with families easily qualify for 'food stamps'
","Pitching for a bump in the minimum wage, a labor leader suggested a hike could save all Texans money by elevating low-income workers who’d no longer need government help. We don’t know about that. But we flipped on the Texas Truth-O-Meter after John Patrick, president of the Texas AFL-CIO, said at a January 2017 Capitol press conference: ""If you have a family, the current minimum wage easily qualifies you for food stamps."" Really? ""Food stamps"" is an outdated term referring to food benefits available to income-eligible residents through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Beneficiaries purchase food and groceries using electronic benefit transfer cards. Nationally on average in 2015, about 45.8 million people in 22.5 million households monthly participated in SNAP, according to the federal government, and because benefits are available to most low-income households, participants represent a broad cross-section of the nation's poor. A November 2016 U.S. Department of Agriculture report states that in the year, 55 percent of SNAP households with children included people with jobs. Still, the average gross income of participating households was $786 a month, the report says, which breaks out to $9,432 a year. We asked the Texas AFL-CIO for the basis of Patrick’s claim. By email, spokesman Ed Sills said a full-time minimum-wage Texas worker earns $7.25 an hour (identical to the federal minimum). Multiplied over 2,000 work hours in a year, that’s an annual income of approximately $14,500. The labor group’s use of 2,000 hours in a work year contrasts with the 2,087-hour work year used by the federal government in its data assumptions. Using that figure, a single full-time worker would earn $15,130 in a year. Sills otherwise said that according to maximum monthly income limits posted by the state, a family could easily qualify for SNAP with a single worker earning the minimum wage. He pointed out the relevant chart, posted on a Texas Health and Human Services Commission web page titled  ""SNAP Food Benefits."" We proceeded to crunch the figures, which mostly supported Patrick’s claim, though we also noticed Patrick hadn’t said if he was thinking solely of families with one full-time minimum-wage worker; Sills told us by phone that he believed so. A twist Then came a twist causing us to realize the commission-posted figures were out of date. We recognized as much when Christine Mann, a commission press officer, responded to our inquiry about Patrick’s claim by providing SNAP-eligibility household income thresholds lower than the thresholds on the agency’s SNAP food benefits web page--which Mann told us would be updated. Mann later provided a commission web link to the up-to-date income eligibility figures. For our part, we spotted the same income-eligibility numbers on a USDA web page that describes the figures as in effect for the fiscal year running through September 2017. Mann’s response also indicated that qualifying for SNAP is more complicated than simply grossing less than a particular threshold. ""Eligibility for SNAP is based on household size, the countable amount of gross and net income for all mandatory household members, and allowed deductions"" for items including shelter, utilities, child care and medical expenses, Mann wrote. Agency confirmation Mann otherwise told us that a single minimum-wage full-time worker in a household of two to three people would draw monthly gross income of $1,255.70. In support of Patrick’s claim, that amount runs short of the up-to-date income thresholds to qualify for SNAP of $1,736 a month for a two-person household or $2,184 a month for a three-person household. Bigger households with a single full-time minimum-wage worker would qualify too, we calculated, as would households of four or more with two full-time minimum-wage workers. We identified one exception: A household of three with two full-time minimum-wage workers, which would have a combined gross monthly income of $2,511.40, would earn too much to qualify for SNAP at the qualifying gross-income threshold of $2,184 a month for a household of three. We separately asked the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which says it advocates for conditions enabling every Texan to be healthy, well-educated and financially secure, to assess Patrick’s statement. By email, Oliver Bernstein described calculations like our own; he said the claim holds up. Our ruling Patrick said that in Texas, ""if you have a family, the current minimum wage easily qualifies you for food stamps."" Our finding is that a household of two or more residents including a single full-time minimum-wage worker would clearly qualify for SNAP as would a household of four or more with two full-time minimum-wage workers. A three-person household with two such workers would gross too much to qualify. We rate this claim Mostly True.

"['Supreme Court', 'PunditFact', 'Sean Hannity']","
No, the 9th Circuit isn't the 'most overturned court in the country,' as Hannity says
","Fox News host Sean Hannity says it’s no surprise that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against President Donald Trump and his executive order on immigration. ""We have both been predicting for days now the 9th Circuit — the most liberal court of appeals, the most overturned court in the country — it would act this way,"" Hannity said on his show Feb. 9, speaking with a guest. Several states have sued the Trump administration over its executive order that temporarily blocks immigration and travel from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa. A federal trial court judge in Seattle ruled Feb. 3 that the federal government could not enforce the executive order while the case is pending. So lawyers for the administration appealed that decision to the 9th Circuit, which hears cases from most of the western United States and Alaska and Hawaii. On Feb. 9, a panel of three judges ruled unanimously to affirm the Seattle judge’s decision. (The court didn’t rule on whether the executive order is legal. That will happen later.) It’s possible the administration will try to appeal their case again, this time to the Supreme Court. Right after the judges handed down their decision, Trump tweeted, ""SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!"" As Hannity noted, the 9th Circuit has a reputation for being liberal. But we wondered if he was correct when he said the Supreme Court overturns more cases from the 9th Circuit than any other appeals court in the country — the implication being that the 9th Circuit is out of step with the Supreme Court. In our research, we found that the 9th Circuit has a higher-than-average reversal rate, but not the highest. Additionally, experts told us that counting reversals doesn’t necessarily say much about the quality or substance of the 9th Circuit’s work. The numbers To evaluate this claim, we turned to SCOTUSBlog’s Supreme Court statistics archive, specifically their Circuit Scorecards, which track how often the Supreme Court justices agree or disagree with the lower court decisions. The Supreme Court hears cases from the 50 state courts and 13 federal appeals courts, known as circuit courts. The cases that the Supreme Court chooses to take on are often disputed among the lower courts, complex, and problematic, so there’s a reasonable chance that the Supreme Court will decide that the lower court’s decision was wrong. In fact, the Supreme Court reversed about 70 percent of cases it took between 2010-15. Among cases it reviewed from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, it reversed about 79 percent. The 9th Circuit’s reversal rate is higher than average, but it’s not the absolute highest among the circuit courts. That distinction goes to the 6th Circuit, which serves Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, with an 87 percent average between 2010-15.  The 9th Circuit is in third place. 6th Circuit - 87 percent; 11th Circuit - 85 percent; 9th Circuit - 79 percent; 3rd Circuit - 78 percent; 2nd Circuit and Federal Circuit - 68 percent; 8th Circuit - 67 percent; 5th Circuit - 66 percent; 7th Circuit - 48 percent; DC Circuit - 45 percent; 1st Circuit and 4th Circuit - 43 percent; 10th Circuit - 42 percent. We also found that the 9th Circuit never had the highest reversal rate in any individual term between 2004-15. (That’s the farthest back we could go.) A spokesperson for Hannity pointed us to a 2014 article in National Review titled, ""Ninth Circuit Leading the Pack for ‘Most Reversed.’ "" But the evidence presented in the article does not support the headline. So Hannity’s claim that the 9th Circuit is the ""most overturned court in the country"" is incorrect. The Supreme Court only hears a handful of cases from each circuit each year, so the rate of reversal is highly variable, said Jonah Gelbach, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a statistician. In 2014, for instance, the 2nd Circuit had a reversal rate of 100 percent, which sounds pretty bad until you find out that the Supreme Court only heard one case from the 2nd Circuit that entire season. The 9th Circuit is by far the largest circuit. In the 12 months leading up to March, 31, 2015, just under 12,000 cases were filed in the 9th Circuit — more than 4,000 more than the next-largest circuit, the 5th Circuit. Despite that gigantic docket, the Supreme Court heard just 11 cases from the 9th Circuit in 2015, reversing eight. This means the Supreme Court generally reverses far less than 1 percent of all the cases the 9th Circuit (and other circuits) decide. ""Given the small numbers of cases involved, it can be difficult to draw any serious conclusions from such statistics about the quality of the courts involved,"" Gelbach said. ""Having said that, the 9th Circuit does seem to consistently have a high reversal rate over time."" It’s possible that the sheer size of the 9th Circuit, as well as some of its procedures, cause it to produce more ""outlier decisions,"" which are cases the Supreme Court always reverses, than other circuits — leading to a higher reversal rate, said University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt. Roosevelt said there might have been a time in the past when the 9th Circuit was considerably more liberal than the Supreme Court, stemming from the fact that Democratic President Jimmy Carter didn’t get the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice, though he did appoint several judges to the 9th Circuit. Today, the 9th Circuit might still have the highest number of Democratic appointees of any appeals court, but there’s been enough turnover in the past few decades that it’s not as much of an outlier, Roosevelt said. Our ruling Hannity said the 9th Circuit is ""the most overturned court in the country."" While the 9th Circuit has a higher than average reversal rate among cases it sends to the Supreme Court, it has not had the highest rate since at least 2004 (the oldest data point we could find). Even if it did, experts told us that the massive size of the 9th Circuit compared to the handful of cases it sends to the Supreme Court every year make reversal rates an imperfect measure of the quality of the 9th Circuit’s decisions. More broadly, experts say this statistic is a poor way of comparing courts. We rate Hannity’s claim False.",/factchecks/2017/feb/10/sean-hannity/no-9th-circuit-isnt-most-overturned-court-country-/

Dawn Buckingham incorrectly says hundreds of illegal immigrants released by Travis County
","Physician Dawn Buckingham, Travis County’s newcomer in the Texas Senate, touted her co-authorship of a Senate-approved measure to ban so-called sanctuary city policies statewide by using her home county as an example. The Republican from Lakeway, elected in 2016 to represent Senate District 24, said in a Feb. 8, 2017, email blast: ""I believe in a safe Travis County and a safe Texas, and actions recently taken by the Travis County Sheriff's Office have endangered our community and our state."" Buckingham’s email continued: ""Hundreds of illegal immigrants subject to detainers were released in the last week since the new sanctuary policy was adopted by the Travis County Sheriff's Office, and I am proud the Senate has acted quickly in response."" Curious, we put Buckingham’s numbers to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. Travis County's new policy The policy mentioned by Buckingham refers to Travis County’s new Democratic sheriff, Sally Hernandez, announcing in January 2017 that the office no longer would automatically honor federal ""detainer"" requests to hold individuals of interest to immigration authorities for 48 hours. ""The public must be confident that local law enforcement is focused on local public safety, not on federal immigration enforcement,"" Hernandez said in an online video in which she also said that, previously, inmates handed off to immigration authorities were deported after posting bond and without resolving local criminal charges. Under the policy, Hernandez said, the office would honor detainer requests only if an inmate were charged with murder, sexual assault or human trafficking — or if federal agents obtained a court order or arrest warrant for a suspect. Otherwise, she said, inmates would be allowed to post bail and be released, no matter their immigration status. Buckingham's backup sought We asked Buckingham how she determined hundreds of immigrants were subsequently released. By email, her spokesman Keith Elkins provided a statement from Buckingham lacking information about her declared ""hundreds."" Rather, Buckingham said county residents need to know the sheriff’s office ""has ignored hundreds of requests to detain inmates"" in the country illegally. Latest count: 45 released individuals in eight days According to the sheriff’s office, we confirmed, 40 individuals were released on bail by the county the first few days after the sheriff’s policy took effect. When we followed up, a sheriff’s office spokeswoman, Kristen Dark, emailed us additional information indicating that through the day Buckingham made her claim, 45 individuals for whom detainer requests were denied by the office had been released--leaving others (more than 150 inmates by our calculation) still in custody, Dark said, for not making bond or because their charges had not yet been disposed. Much of this detail was public before Buckingham spoke. Citing information attributed to Dark, the Austin American-Statesman reported Feb. 2, 2017, that the new policy had ""paved the way for the release of 37 suspected unauthorized immigrants"" the day before. On the policy’s first day, the newspaper reported, the sheriff’s office declined requests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to place holds on 196 suspected undocumented immigrants--while the office honored 30 detainer requests. ""Once the so-called ICE detainers were removed, 37 people were able to bail out Wednesday,"" the newspaper reported. ""Had the detainers remained in place, inmates would still have been able to post bail, but they would have been released into ICE custody for possible deportation."" A subsequent American-Statesman news story, posted online Feb. 6, 2017, said the county had denied 203 detainer requests and released 40 such individuals since the policy took effect. Meantime, the story said, immigration agents adjusting to the county’s policy had hustled to obtain arrest warrants for 42 booked individuals who also were suspected of living in the country without legal authorization. By the time the warrants were served, the story said, eight of the inmates had posted bail and been released, requiring agents to find and arrest the suspects again. Hernandez told the paper the others named in the warrants would be released to federal agents. The story quoted Daryl Fields, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office, saying federal officials had stepped-up reviews of newly arrested Travis County residents so warrants could be sought for suspects -- avoiding reliance on the sheriff’s office to comply with detainer requests. The story further said immigration agents became aware that the suspects had been booked into jail by mining a federal law enforcement fingerprint database that’s routinely updated by county jail staff. Our ruling Buckingham said hundreds of illegal immigrants were released in the week after the sheriff’s policy was adopted. According to Travis County, 45 such individuals--not hundreds--were released in the eight days after the policy took effect. Additional releases seem likely due to the sheriff’s office not automatically honoring all detainer requests. But it also seems possible that stepped-up federal efforts to obtain warrants for jailed individuals will reduce the release rate. We rate Buckingham’s claim False.

Then and now: Graduation rates in Buffalo schools
","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wants to give $10 million to Buffalo’s Say Yes to Education program as part of his proposed state budget. The money would come from a proposed $500 million second phase of the Buffalo Billion program. The Say Yes program provides college scholarships to public and charter school graduates in Buffalo. The program has helped boost graduation rates in the city’s school district, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said at a budget hearing in Albany. ""Since the program has been in place in our community, high school graduation rates, which sadly were abysmally low in Buffalo hovering around 48 percent are now up to 64 percent,"" Brown said at the hearing. Is Brown right about the district’s graduation rates? Say Yes to Education The Say Yes program was launched in Buffalo in December 2011. Buffalo became the second city with the program, following Syracuse. The first graduates eligible for the program graduated in 2013. The program opened with $15 million in funding and has since raised $25 million from private donors. Graduation rates  The city school district recorded a 46.8 percent four-year graduation rate through June of the 2011-2012 school year, according to the New York state Education Department. The rate increased to 53.4 percent in 2013, the first year graduates were eligible for the program.  The graduation rate then dropped to 52.8 percent in 2014, but climbed to 58.4 percent in 2015. The district had a 61.7 percent graduation rate through June 2016, the state Education Department said Friday. The rate is 64 percent when August graduates are included. That information was not publicly available when Brown made his claim. Our ruling Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said graduation rates, once ""around 48 percent are now up to 64 percent"" in Buffalo’s school district since the Say Yes program began in Buffalo. Brown is right that graduation rates have improved since the program was first offered to graduates in 2013.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's $180 million from Exxon: a 'government service golden parachute'?
","In moving from CEO of Exxon Mobil to Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson is getting $180 million from his former company. But is the payment a ""government service golden parachute"" that Tillerson would not get had he taken a different job? That’s the allegation from U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who has railed against people who cash in by moving from the private sector into government jobs. Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat who faces re-election in 2018, made her attack on the Senate floor on Jan. 31, 2017, the day before Tillerson was sworn in as President Donald Trump’s secretary of state. Baldwin referred to President Barack Obama’s administration and a bill she said was aimed at ""slowing the revolving door"" in Washington, then said: ""I was inspired to introduce this legislation when I saw several Obama administration appointees receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for leaving their private-sector jobs to join the government. These ‘government service golden parachutes,’ as they are known, demonstrate how valuable some companies believe it is to have friends in high places."" Tillerson, she continued, ""received a $180 million payout from Exxon Mobil that he would have to forfeit had he taken a job elsewhere."" What we found is that Baldwin is right on the figure. But the payment is a retirement benefit that Tillerson earned after more than 40 years with the company, not extra compensation conditioned on joining the government a few months before reaching the company’s mandatory retirement age. Indeed, experts told us, he likely only risked losing the $180 million had he gone to work for an Exxon Mobil competitor. The money -- yes There was no government requirement, PolitiFact New York found, for Tillerson to divest from his Exxon Mobil stock. But had he kept the stock, he would have had to recuse himself of any State Department business related to the company, or take other steps to avoid a conflict of interest. An agreement he made with Exxon Mobil -- the one that drew Baldwin’s attack -- is aimed at avoiding the conflict of interest. The Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, The Guardian and other news organizations reported on an announcement of the agreement, as well as a filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission that Exxon Mobil made on Jan. 4, 2017. That was a few days after Tillerson’s retirement and a week before his Senate confirmation hearing. Tillerson had been set to receive roughly $180 million in Exxon Mobil shares that would have vested over a decade following his retirement, which was expected to be in March 2017, when he turns 65. Instead, Exxon essentially ""cashed out"" Tillerson. Under the agreement, the shares were transferred to an independently managed trust, which will pay Tillerson the $180 million over the same 10-year schedule. The deal amounts to about $7 million less than the compensation package that he would have received if he had not been tapped for the post, the Wall Street Journal noted. ‘Golden parachute’ -- no Now let’s turn to Baldwin’s larger point -- that the payment is a ""government service golden parachute"" Tillerson would not get if ""had he taken a job elsewhere."" Baldwin’s office sent us information, but no one replied to our requests to speak to someone in the office. The office suggested we contact Jeff Hauser, who is executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C.. Hauser argued that Exxon Mobil gave ""special dispensation"" to Tillerson by cashing him out on the stock that otherwise would have taken 10 years to vest. He noted that the company’s policy states that executives risk losing long-term equity awards by retiring early. But the policy also allows for the company to decide that the executive can keep the awards, which is what it did in making the $180 million agreement. Rosanna Landis Weaver, executive compensation project manager for Oakland, Calif.-based As You Sow, a national group that advocates for shareholders, also criticized Exxon Mobil for not sticking to its usual practice of long-term vesting. She told us she expects the cash payout to the trust, rather than receiving the stock over time, will benefit Tillerson financially, though she acknowledged that’s an open question. But Baldwin’s statement isn’t about the impact of Tillerson’s deal on Exxon Mobil stockholders and the $180 million doesn’t come as a result of Tillerson taking the secretary of state job. ""It doesn't appear to be a reward specifically for going into government service, but rather a standard agreement in which he gets the payout as long as he does not work in the (oil) industry for 10 years,"" said Ari Goldberg, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Project On Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government accountability watchdog.    A ""golden parachute"" typically refers to severance payments executives get after their companies are acquired or made part of a merger. Indeed, the federal tax code refers to parachute payments as compensation paid as a result of a change in control of a company. But the payment Tillerson is getting isn’t something extra. It’s a retirement benefit he had earned. ""Tillerson is clearly getting a large cash settlement, but this reflects payments for services earned over the prior many years, and not a cash reward or ‘parachute’ tied to his resignation,"" said executive compensation expert Kevin Murphy, a finance and business economics professor at the University of Southern California. We’ll note that Baldwin used the lesser known term ""government service golden parachute."" But that typically is used by groups such as the AFL-CIO union in reference to Wall Street. It refers to financial incentives Wall Street firms give to senior executives who take government jobs. The concern is whether the companies then expect favorable government treatment from their former executives. Others refer to government-based golden parachutes provided by Wall Street banks as accelerated vesting of equity-based awards for senior executives who resign voluntarily to enter government service -- in other words, compensation that they would otherwise forfeit for failing to meet normal vesting requirements. That’s more similar to Tillerson’s situation. But Murphy and another executive compensation expert Steven Balsam, told us it’s highly unlikely that Tillerson would have lost out on his retirement benefits, a few months before reaching the mandatory retirement age, simply by taking another job -- unless it was with an Exxon Mobil competitor. ""This terms of his retirement/separation were agreed upon prior to his being nominated to be secretary of state. He’s not getting it because he took the (secretary of state) job,"" said Balsam,  a business professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. Our rating Baldwin says Tillerson got a ""government service golden parachute"" payment of $180 million ""from Exxon Mobil that he would have to forfeit had he taken a job elsewhere.""   The amount is correct and the company did opt to ""cash out"" Tillerson because he would be becoming secretary of state.

Do Tanzania farmers face prison terms for trading seeds thanks to foreign aid?
","It’s a story of foreign aid doing more harm than good. Money from western governments intended to lift farmers out of poverty has inadvertently opened a pathway to imprisonment in Tanzania, according to Danielle Nierenberg, president of the advocacy group Food Tank. Nierenberg said on Twitter that Tanzania farmers face 12 years in prison for trading seeds thanks to foreign aid. Spread this news - Tanzania farmers face 12 years in prison for trading seeds thanks to foreign aid: https://t.co/9yjaWMnRMK @mondiaalnieuws pic.twitter.com/66fV0gJl38 The link between the aid and the prison terms is more indirect than the tweet suggests, but Nierenberg is right that a development program spurred (apparently unenforced) policy changes in Tanzania that includes jail time.  Let’s parse it out. A questionable alliance Nierenberg told us her source was a December 2016 article in Mondiaal Nieuws, a Flemish magazine. According to the article, Tanzania passed intellectual property rights legislation on seeds as a condition for receiving aid through the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition. Spearheaded by the White House in 2012, the New Alliance brings together G8 countries, African governments, development partners, corporations and local businesses. It aims to lift 50 million people out of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa by 2022. Under the alliance, G8 countries (France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, Canada, and Russia) and the European Union committed to providing funding, and hundreds of companies promised investments. Simultaneously, the 10 participating African nations agreed to enact policies to advance agriculture and reduce hunger. But food and poverty advocacy groups say the alliance benefits big agricultural businesses at the expense of small-scale farmers. Seed law reform, in particular, ""raises serious concerns that governments will prioritize the adoption and enforcement of strict intellectual property protections of companies over the rights of small-scale producers to develop, save, re-use, exchange, and sell seeds,"" according to Oxfam. All participating African countries, except Benin, committed to reform seed laws in their cooperation frameworks. Nigeria and Mozambique agreed to comply with seed standards set by regional development organizations. Tanzania, meanwhile, stands out for its even more stringent seed protection goals. The East African country committed to updating laws to align with the International Union for the Protection of New Variety of Plants (UPOV). Members of UPOV, most of which are developed countries, agree to international intellectual property standards for protecting new plant varieties. Under the most recent convention, UPOV 1991, small farmers are no longer able to save, sell or exchange farm-saved seeds, according to Intellectual Property Watch’s Catherine Saez. In 2014, Tanzania enacted a Plant Breeders’ Rights Act — to the objection of farmers’ organizations and civil society organizations. The new breeders’ rights law ""disregards the contributions of small-scale farmers, marginalizes their varieties and adversely impacts on their interests and livelihoods as it severely restricts farmers from engaging in their customary practices of freely sharing, exchanging and selling seed/propagating material,"" 10 organizations wrote in a letter. The legislation protects the intellectual property rights of plant varieties new to Tanzania, and penalizes violators with a fine of 2 million to 10 million Tanzanian shilling (about $900 to $4,500) or up to three years imprisonment, or both. Tanzania also amended its 2003 Seed Act to align with the 1991 UPOV convention and became a member state a year later — to the objection of farmers’ organizations and civil society organizations. The amended seed act imposes a fine of 100 million to 500 million Tanzanian shilling (about $445,000 to $225,230) or between five to 12 years imprisonment, or both, for selling or trading any certified seeds. That being said, we weren't able to find any instances of the fines or prison terms actually imposed on any farmer. Ebe Daems, the author of the Mondiaal Nieuws article Nierenberg cited, told us she wasn't aware of the law being applied either. ""The government was claiming the law wasn't intended to be used against small farmers,"" she said. ""NGO's were lobbying to add an explicit exception for small farmers to the law. I don't know if they got anywhere with that by now.""   Cash with strings? Under the New Alliance, Tanzania received $897 million in funding from developed countries (including $315 million from the United States) and hundreds of millions in investments from corporations. But it’s unclear if this aid was contingent upon Tanzania agreeing to enact more stringent seed protections. Heidi Chow, a food campaigner at the U.K.-based Global Justice Now, characterized the policy update as a conditional for receiving the money. ""Big agribusinesses have identified the African continent as the last frontier with the most untapped market potential. What this aid scheme is doing is facilitating that process,"" Chow said. ""The whole UPOV agenda is being very heavily pushed in Africa."" Kate Van Waes, policy director of the One campaign, was more skeptical. She pointed out that the seed protections also limited government control on prices and distributions of the seeds. ""How the policies that were decided upon got put into place was mostly between governments,"" she said, adding that the policy provisions aligned with each African nation’s Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme plans. ""I think privatization of the seed sector was something that has been going on for a while. Whether there were conditions, I don’t know."" Most advocates agree that the New Alliance lacks transparency and input from farmers and citizens, but there’s disagreement on whether corporations should be playing a role at all. ""Sometimes there’s a tendency when you hear privatization is involved (to assume) it’s under the big bad Monsanto thing,"" said Van Waes. ""There’s no way for donor governments or African countries to do it on their own. You have to pull in the private sector."" African governments actively welcomed the New Alliance to attract investments to their countries, Chow said, but this led to policies that ceded control of food systems to agribusinesses and protected their investments. ""We’re using state money, taxpayer money to change to the African countries’ laws to create a structure that structurally benefits the corporations,"" she said. ""Aid should be aid. You can’t tie it up around policy changes."" Our ruling Nierenberg tweeted, ""Tanzania farmers face 12 years in prison for trading seeds thanks to foreign aid."" Under the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, Tanzania received millions in aid and investments from Western governments and businesses. At the same time, it enacted stronger intellectual property rights for seed varieties that included a maximum sentence of 12 years for violations.  So the penalty is an indirect effect of the aid, but whether the sentence was a condition for it is unclear. Futhermore, the government doesn't appear to be enforcing the law. We rate Nierenberg’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/feb/10/danielle-nierenberg/do-tanzania-farmers-face-prison-terms-trading-seed/

Joe Sanfelippo: 39 percent of violent criminals return to prison following their release
","Three state lawmakers from southeastern Wisconsin want to toughen penalties on those who repeatedly commit violent crimes. ""We know that habitual offenders are increasingly terrorizing our neighborhoods and preying on innocent victims,"" state Rep. Joe Sanfelippo (R-West Allis), a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a YouTube video uploaded Feb. 1, 2017. As Sanfelippo spoke, a graphic behind him caught our attention. It claimed that ""Over 39% of violent criminals return to prison following their release."" Repeat offenders To check the claim, we turned first to an official report on recidivism published by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections in September 2016. It tracks whether inmates are sentenced for a new crime after they are released from prison for an earlier offense. The report shows recidivism trends covering more than 156,000 offenders who were released from the Wisconsin correctional system between 1990 and 2013, Corrections Secretary Jon E. Litscher wrote in an introduction. Quick takeaway: Since the early 1990s, the percentage of inmates who are convicted of a new crime within three years of getting out of prison has fallen steadily. In the category of ""violent"" criminals, the Department of Corrections looked at those convicted of murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, negligent manslaughter, kidnapping, other sexual assault, simple assault, and other violent offenses including intimidation, illegal abortion, extortion, cruelty toward a child or wife and hit-and-run driving with bodily injury. Violent crimes do not include aggravated burglary or burglary, DOC spokesman Tristan Cook told us. The standards come from the Association of State Correctional Administrators (ASCA) Performance-Based Measures System. For those who committed violent crimes -- the group Sanfelippo is interested in -- 27.2% were considered recidivists, according to the latest state report. So does that mean Sanfelippo is way off target by saying ""over 39% return to prison?"" Not necessarily. There’s a wrinkle here related to the definition of ""recidivism."" Under the definition used in the report, recidivism means those who are convicted and sentenced for a new crime. That leaves out a whole category of offenders who return to prison without being convicted of a new crime. Typically they land in prison when their probation, parole or extended supervision is revoked by the state. When you factor in those cases, the rate was 39.7% in the most recent figures, according to the state Department of Corrections. It’s that calculation that Sanfelippo points to in backing up his claim. The state calls that the ""reincarceration rate."" It’s a commonly used measurement in incarceration research. And Sanfelippo’s phrasing in the video squares with that data. Another factor But there is one issue with his approach. Sanfelippo portrays these repeat violent offenders as ""terrorizing our neighborhoods,"" but many who are sent back due to parole violations and related matters have done something that does not warrant a new criminal charge. Violent offenders are returned quite frequently for technical violations, in part because they are under more stringent supervision due to the serious nature of their offenses, said Thomas LeBel, a criminal justice expert at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. A Journal Sentinel investigation published in 2015 found the process that sends violators back behind bars relies largely on the judgment of individual parole agents, which can vary widely. Among the reincarcerated, more than half were imprisoned when their probation, parole or extended supervision was revoked, with no new conviction and sentencing, Corrections Department statistics show. In those types of cases, there was suspected criminal activity in about 70% of cases involving some 3,000 ex-offenders sent back to prison without being convicted of new crimes in 2015, Corrections Department statistics show. But technical violations are a factor too. They can include things such as accepting a job without permission, missing a meeting with a probation or parole officer, or leaving their home counties, according to a study by WISDOM, a statewide group of faith leaders and activists dedicated to prison reform. Indeed, some can wind up back in prison even if acquitted of charges in court. In February 2017, the Journal Sentinel wrote about Damien Payne, a Milwaukee man on state supervision after release from prison in 2010. Payne was found not guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm and of carrying a concealed weapon, but still was sent to prison for more than three years. A Corrections Department rule allows that action. Our rating Sanfelippo claimed that ""over 39% of violent criminals return to prison following their release."" The number tracks a credible report by the state, so it’s on target. But it needs clarification because Sanfelippo portrays the repeat offenders as ""terrorizing"" neighborhoods when some very likely were imprisoned anew for lesser violations. That’s our definition of Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2017/feb/10/joe-sanfelippo/joe-sanfelippo-39-percent-violent-criminals-return/

Durbin oversimplifies Supreme Court voting process
","The morning after President Donald Trump announced Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee to fill the vacant seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe to share his thoughts about the president’s pick. Durbin, the Democratic whip and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in the interview he believes Gorsuch should have a hearing, but that the nominee also should meet the required voting standard.  ""(Gorsuch) should have a hearing and he should meet the voting standard that Supreme Court nominees are held to of 60 votes. A standard that was met by Elena Kagan as well as Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's choices,"" Durbin told the show’s hosts. With Senate Republicans considering the so-called ""nuclear option"" to lower the vote threshold needed to confirm Gorsuch, we decided to double-check Durbin’s declaration. Durbin has a point, but he does oversimplifies the process for Senate votes on Supreme Court nominees. Notably, a formal confirmation vote does not require 60 votes. Voting standard? Of the nearly 4,000 government positions Trump must fill, 1,212 require a Senate confirmation. That includes all Cabinet-level posts as well as hundreds of other senior positions and agency heads. Here’s how the confirmation process will work for Gorsuch: He will testify in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. If the committee refers his nomination to the full Senate (a likely outcome due to the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee), a vote by the full Senate needs to be taken. The Senate majority leader moves to take the Senate into an executive session, the setting in which nominees are confirmed, according to Worth Hester, the assistant director of the Georgetown Government Affairs Institute. Then, the Senate majority leader needs to bring a nominee to a vote by the full Senate. In Gorsuch’s case, barring any outstanding circumstances, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will either get unanimous consent, a process by which every senator agrees to schedule a vote on a nominee. However, if unanimous consent cannot be reached, and if at least one senator filibusters, Sen. McConnell would need to invoke cloture. A ""cloture vote,"" agrees to place a time limit on the consideration of a nominee. A successful cloture requires 60 votes. After the cloture vote, Senate rules allow for 30 additional hours of debate, and then a final confirmation vote occurs, according to Sarah Binder, political scientist at George Washington University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. This confirmation process for some positions became less burdensome thanks to a rule change on Nov. 21, 2013. With the Senate’s Republican minority blocking President Barack Obama’s nominees for executive branch positions and, in particular, appeals court judges, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., triggered the so-called nuclear option by a successful 52-48 vote, eliminating the 60-vote threshold needed to confirm most nominations, and with it, the threat of a filibuster. The rule change, however, excluded Supreme Court nominees, meaning that such nominations could be filibustered. And that’s something that some Democrats have threatened  to do against the Gorsuch nomination. The Republicans currently hold 52 seats in the Senate -- enough to reach the final vote threshold of 51 votes, but only if they can get that far. Now that we’ve addressed some background information about the nuclear option and current situation at hand, let’s take a look at Durbin’s claim. Nomination and confirmation of Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan Following the election of Obama in November 2008, Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress and essentially held 59 seats in the Senate because two independents caucused with them. In May 2009, Obama nominated U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Sonia Sotomayor of New York for the Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice David Souter. Senate Judiciary Committee hearings began on June 1 of that year, and Sotomayor was confirmed by a vote of 68-31 on Aug. 6. Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts did not vote. He died on Aug. 25 -- 15 months after being diagnosed with brain cancer. If Kennedy had been present for the vote, Senate Democrats would have had a filibuster-proof majority. But that didn’t matter because nine Republicans voted to confirm Sotomayor. Then almost exactly one year later, Obama’s nominee to replace retiring Justice John Paul Stevens, U.S. Solicitor General Elena Kagan, was confirmed by the Senate on Aug. 6 in a 63-37 vote, with five Republicans voting in favor and one Democrat, former Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, voting against. During the confirmation of both Sotomayor and Kagan, Democrats had a comfortable majority that was near filibuster-proof if not for the absence of Kennedy in August 2009 and the lone dissenting Democratic vote by Nelson in August 2010. On the surface, the margins achieved by Sotomayor and Kagan would seem to support Durbin’s argument that the confirmations required 60 votes. However, it’s more complicated than that. The nominations were never filibustered, so no 60-vote cloture motion was required. And the final confirmation required only 51 votes. In fact, two sitting justices -- Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas -- never reached 60 votes in their final tally. The key word that trips up Durbin is ""standard."" The existing Senate ""standard"" says nothing about reaching 60 votes. If the standard for passing a class is earning a C, and someone gets a B, it doesn’t mean that a B was required to pass the class. The ""standard"" to pass the class is still a C. Whether this longstanding standard lasts into the future, given the degree of polarization in Congress today, is another question entirely. Our rating In an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe show, Durbin said Obama’s nominees met a standard of 60 votes, ""a standard that was met by Elena Kagan as well as Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's choices."" Obama’s nominees cleared the procedural hurdles and won 60 votes and then some. The Senate confirmed Kagan by a roll call vote of 63-37 in 2010, and Sotomayor was confirmed in 2009 by a vote of 68-31. Kagan and Sotomayor ultimately would have had enough votes to be able to break a filibuster, but they never had to -- and the margins they got on the final, simple-majority vote can’t be used to retroactively define what the ""standard"" was.
