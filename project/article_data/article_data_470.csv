Nathan Deal said campaign of Republican gubernatorial runoff opponent Karen Handel is negative
","
Once again, a contender in the Republican runoff for governor has launched a negative attack.

The reason? His opponent has gone too negative, he said.

The campaign of former U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal of Gainesville launched its assault in a news release Friday. It said former Secretary of State Karen Handel has run ""a 100 percent negative campaign. Not one all-positive mail piece or TV ad.""

The Handel camp disagrees. Portions of its mailers are positive, a spokesman said. The remainder are ""contrasts"" that accurately compare her with her opponents. Plus, Deal's campaign has done its share of attacks.

The winner of the Aug. 10 runoff will go on to face former Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, during the general election in November.

So has Handel really run a ""100 percent negative campaign""?

Deal's camp produced four Handel mailers and two TV commercials as evidence. This item reviews each of them but does not assess whether the attacks are true.

""Solid""

Handel's campaign launched the ""Solid"" TV ad for the runoff against Deal.

""One carries a purse,"" an announcer says over images of a green purse and Handel.

""The other carries baggage,"" he continues. A black-and-white image of Deal appears next to a moneybag. Quotes about Deal using the words ""corrupt"" and ""scandal"" zip across the screen.

At one point, it calls Deal ""a corrupt relic of Washington, D.C.""

Negative.

""Investigation Journal"" 

This four-page runoff mailer looks like a magazine. The title ""Investigation Journal"" runs across its cover near a photo of Deal.

""Nathan Deal's Corruption Probed,"" it says. ""Back Room Deals, Million Dollar Payments and Resignation from Congress."" The remainder reviews news accounts of accusations that Deal violated ethics rules. 

Negative.

""Lipstick"" 

This 30-second spot ran during the Republican primary. The attacks take place in the ad's first 12 seconds.

""Three who have iffy ethics. One who wears lipstick,"" it begins. 

Three black-and-white smiles appear on the screen next to a pair of red lips.

""Three who look after themselves. One who looks after you,"" the announcer continues. 

The black-and-white smiles transform into photos of Handel's opponents in the primary, Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, state Sen. Eric Johnson and Deal, next to a smiling pair of red lips.

Negative.

""Three Who Look Out for Themselves, Only One Who Looks Out for Us"" 

The title of this four-page primary mailer is self-explanatory. It attacks the same opponents that she did in the ""Lipstick"" ad. A chart comparing the candidates says they all have ethics problems and were previously Democrats, among other things.

Negative.

""Fulton County's Own Karen Handel Stands Up Against Corruption ... While her Opponents are Politics as Usual""

This four-page primary mailer attacks the same three candidates. Although two pages are mainly devoted to her campaign promises and records, the front and back covers are attacks on her opponents and accusations that they behaved unethically. 

Mostly negative, with some positive portions.

""Georgia Conservative""

This eight-page primary mailer, which also looks like a magazine, is mostly positive. The cover touts her conservative credentials, life story and business history.

Two pages detail her personal, business and political records. Two discuss her platform.

But the next two are once again attacks on Republican primary candidates that repeat accusations from other attack mailers. The back cover calls her opponents ""good-ole-boys.""

Mostly positive, with some negative portions.

So where does this leave us?

PolitiFact Georgia asked Handel's camp for wholly positive mailers to counter Deal's claim, but it produced none. Her camp's defense is that what Deal's campaign said are negative attacks are actually ""comparisons"" between her and her opponents. 

Still, they are negative comparisons. So the Deal campaign's claim that none of her mailers or TV ads are completely positive is correct.

Now labeling anything ""100 percent"" anything is trouble. Significant portions of two of her mailers are positive. In addition, Handel's campaign website, which the Deal campaign's accusation didn't mention in its claim, contains positive elements as well as attacks.

Plus, Deal's campaign doesn't smell like roses. For instance, one TV ad, ""How Can We Trust Karen Handel on Anything?"", accuses Handel of telling ""lies"" about Deal but doesn't say what they are. A mailer accuses her of a ""record of gay activism"" that social conservatives would oppose.

The claim that Handel has run ""a 100 percent negative campaign"" is an attack in itself.

And the fact remains that both of Handel's TV ads are negative, and the majority of pages in Handel's mailers are focused on attacks. While Deal's campaign paid too little attention to the positive elements of her campaign, the overall impression its statement gives is true. Handel's campaign is negative.

We rule Deal's accusation Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD9EC00>],/factchecks/2010/aug/04/nathan-deal/nathan-deal-says-karen-handel-running-negative-cam/
"['National', 'Campaign Finance', 'Elections', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Nancy Pelosi']","
Nancy Pelosi says House Democrats have 2-to-1 lead in campaign funding for 2010
","
On the Aug. 1, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, the show's host asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., how she felt when President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, suggested a few weeks earlier that the Democrats could lose their House majority in the fall elections. Pelosi exuded confidence. 
""You know what, I'm speaker of the House,"" Pelosi said. ""I have a great chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Chris Van Hollen. We have a solid plan of messaging and mobilizing at the grassroots level and management of our campaigns. And we have a two-to-one advantage money-wise. So we feel very confident about where we are, whether that's well known to that gentleman or not."" 
We thought the part of Pelosi's comment worth checking was that House Democrats ""have a two-to-one advantage money-wise"" against House Republicans. 
Because Pelosi mentioned the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee just two sentences earlier, we began by looking at the money statistics for the DCCC and the parallel GOP organization, the National Republican Congressional Committee. Both groups work to elect members of their party to House seats. 
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based group that tracks money in politics, the DCCC had $33,783,724 in the bank through Aug. 3, 2010, compared to $17,039,525 for the NRCC, and neither committee had any debt. That works out almost exactly to a ratio of two-to-one -- just as Pelosi said. 
But while the DCCC/NRCC ratio for cash on hand is probably the best statistic to use, it isn't the only one. So we decided to look at a handful of others for comparison. 
-- The ratio of money raised for the DCCC and NRCC -- not just what's left in the bank. The DCCC has raised $93,706,323 during the 2009-2010 campaign cycle, compared to $75,531,984 for the NRCC. That's a 1.24 to 1 ratio -- a much more even split than cash on hand. 
-- Money totals raised and held by House candidates themselves, rather than by the DCCC or the NRCC. When you look at money raised by the candidates themselves, the Republicans have actually raised slightly more than the Democrats as of Aug. 3, 2010 -- $355,067,654 to $351,238,367. Meanwhile, Democrats running for the House have $245,223,757 in the bank, compared to $173,422,985 for Republican candidates. That's a ratio of about 1.4 to 1. 
Since the Republicans have more candidates running for the House, we also decided to adjust these numbers to reflect amounts raised and held per candidate. The Democrats lead in total money raised per House candidate, $589,326 to $323,670 -- a 1.82 to 1 ratio. They lead by an even larger ratio in cash on hand per House candidate -- $411,000 to $158,000, or 2.6 to 1. 
-- Independent expenditures. Independent expenditures are dollars spent on campaigning by sources other than the candidates' own campaign treasuries. Through July 11, 2010, $19,017,868 was spent independently either for Democratic candidates or against Republican candidates, compared to $7,776,690 spent in support of Republicans or against Democrats. That's a ratio of about 2.4 to 1 favoring Democratic candidates. 
So let's sum up. When comparing the DCCC and the NRCC in cash on hand, Pelosi is on target when she says that there's a two-to-one Democratic advantage. But using four other measures, the Democrats have a smaller lead, including one case in which the Republicans narrowly lead. Using two other measures, the Democrats have a lead of greater than two to one. Of course, these statistics can change before Election Day, and it's not especially surprising that the Democrats lead the Republicans in fundraising -- being the incumbent party in power. Either way, we think the single best statistic to use is the one Pelosi cited correctly, so we'll rate her comment Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD92800>],/factchecks/2010/aug/03/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-house-democrats-have-2-1-lead-ca/

Is Kendrick Meek the second most corrupt Democrat in Congress?
","
In the insider/outsider campaign being waged in the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate, billionaire Jeff Greene continues to paint U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek as a corrupt politician who abuses his power and is too close to special interests.

Greene's latest mailer uses the case of indicted developer Dennis Stackhouse to make his point.

The mailer, which is designed to look like a manila folder, has a picture of Meek on the front cover and two phases -- ""Corruption-tainted Kendrick Meek,"" which is part of a headline used by the Orlando Sentinel, and ""CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION,"" written in red to mimic a stamp mark.

The inside of the folder tells Greene's version of the Meek-Stackhouse story: 

Stackhouse eventually was arrested, accused of stealing nearly $1 million from a failed Miami-area biopharmaceutical complex. Nothing was ever built.

All the evidence helps Greene wind up to his final point.

""Kendrick Meek was named one of the two most corrupt Democrats in Congress by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington,"" the mailer states, highlighting most corrupt in red type.

In this fact check, we'll see if Greene is accurately reflecting the words of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

But first, we want to make sure people are up to speed on who Dennis Stackhouse is, and his ties to Meek.

Stackhouse background

The Miami Herald has been documenting Stackhouse and his plans for a blighted tract of land in Liberty City for years.

Back in 2003, in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country, Stackhouse promised to build a massive biopharmaceutical park. The park was sold as a place where multinational drug companies and prestigious universities would develop cutting-edge medical advances and Miami's public hospital would provide free healthcare to 150,000 poor people a year.

More than 1,500 high-paying jobs would follow, and so would hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and tax revenue. Put simply, it was the most dramatic economic development project ever seen in Miami-Dade.

The politicians were smitten.

They funneled millions in taxpayer dollars into the project.

What did they get for that investment? Nothing. Or, as the Herald put it -- empty lots, dormant earthmovers and piles of dirt and gravel with no sign of the buildings, the biotech companies or the high-tech jobs promised to Liberty City.

Stackhouse was arrested in October 2009, accused of stealing nearly $1 million from a county agency and a private Boston bank through double billings and fake invoices. He is awaiting trial.

One of those smitten politicians -- Meek -- is now running for the U.S. Senate.

In 2004, Meek obtained a $72,750 earmark in the federal budget for the Stackhouse project, the Herald reported. In June 2005, he also helped get a $1 million labor grant for Miami Dade College to train 800 technicians and related workers for the biopharmaceutical park.

In April 2006, Meek requested another $4 million in federal appropriations for Stackhouse's project, money that was never obtained.

But that's not all.

Stackhouse hired Meek's mother, former U.S. Rep. Carrie Meek, paying her $90,000 in consulting fees and paying for a Cadillac Escalade for her to drive.

And Stackhouse arranged a home mortgage for Meek's then-chief of staff in Miami, Anthony D. Williams, and gave Williams $13,000 for the down payment on his house.

Meek has said that he didn't know Stackhouse paid his mother $90,000 and gave his chief of staff $13,000 to help him buy a house.

""I did what I had to do as a representative of this community to bring resources and jobs here,"" Meek said.

That hasn't kept Greene from promoting the connections in TV ads, press releases, and in the manila-folder mailer.

Greene's claim

The claim that Meek was named ""one of the two most corrupt Democrats in Congress"" tracks back to the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

CREW is a group that does exactly what it sounds like it would. It promotes ethics and accountability in government and public life by targeting government officials. The group says it's nonpartisan, but critics note that it tends to target Republicans more than Democrats.

The group has been publishing a Most Corrupt report since 2005 that focuses on Congress. It also produces a report on the worst governors, and tracks and exposes parts of the federal earmark process.

We turned to the most recent Most Corrupt report, from 2009. The report includes a Top 15 list of the most corrupt members of Congress. The list includes eight Democrats -- but not Meek.

He didn't make the Top 20 list in 2008, the Top 22 list in 2007, the Top 20 in 2006, or the 13 in 2005 (we don't know why the numbers varied).

So Meek isn't one of the ""two most corrupt Democrats in Congress,"" according to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington like Greene claims.

What's happening then?

Greene is using a different list, the Crooked Candidates List.

On July 20, 2010, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ""launched an effort to compile the most corrupt and unethical candidates vying for federal office in 2010."" The Crooked Candidates list started with 11 candidates and included Meek for what the group called a ""shady relationship"" with Stackhouse.

Meek was joined on the list by one other Democrat, Alvin Greene of South Carolina, so ostensibly that's where the Greene campaign backs the claim that Meek is one of the two most corrupt Democrats in Congress.

Yet Greene isn't in Congress, he's an unemployed military veteran running for the U.S. Senate. (The original list, we should note, also included Florida Senate candidates Marco Rubio and Charlie Crist.)

To make matters worse for Greene -- Jeff not Alvin -- he was added to the crooked candidates list himself. You can read the rationale why here.

Our ruling

In a new mailer, billionaire Jeff Greene says that ""Kendrick Meek was named one of the two most corrupt Democrats in Congress by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.""

But the group never labeled Meek one of the two most corrupt Democrats in Congress.

It did include Meek on a list of so-called ""crooked candidates,"" along with one other Democrat -- who isn't in Congress. And later, the group added Greene himself to the same list.

The series of amateur follies would be amusing if it wasn't in the middle of an important primary election. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFB7400>],/factchecks/2010/aug/03/jeff-greene/kendrick-meek-second-most-corrupt-democrat-congres/

John Boehner says unemployment has exceeded 9 percent for two years running
","
On the Aug. 1, 2010, edition of Fox News Sunday, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, tried to crystallize how bad the current job picture is. ""This is the first time since the depression that unemployment has stayed above 9 percent for two consecutive years,"" Boehner told host Chris Wallace.

We decided to check whether Boehner was right.

We looked at the numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency responsible for calculating the national unemployment rate. It showed that unemployment has been 9 percent or higher for 14 months running, from May 2009 to June 2010. That's well short of the two years Boehner suggested. And before the downturn, it never got close to being as bad as Boehner claims.

BLS' searchable figures go back to 1948, so we looked through the full data to find historical comparisons. Since 1948, there have only been two periods prior to the current stretch when unemployment exceeded 9 percent. There was a one-month blip in May 1975, and then a 19-month period between March 1982 and September 1983 when unemployment never dipped below 9 percent.

Pre-1948 data is not as comprehensive, but a BLS study shows that things were far, far worse during the Great Depression. The estimated annual unemployment rates stayed above 9 percent for more than a decade -- from 1931 to 1941. Between 1932 and 1935, the unemployment rate exceeded 20 percent in each year.

We considered the possibility that Boehner might have simply misspoken, intending to say that unemployment had exceeded 8 percent for two consecutive years. But that isn't correct either. If you go back a full two years, the unemployment rate in July 2008 was 5.8 percent. From today's vantage point, that seems like a whole lifetime ago.

So any way you look at it, Boehner's statistic was wrong. We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB80A80>],/factchecks/2010/aug/03/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-unemployment-has-exceeded-9-perc/
"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Republican Governors Association']","
Republican Governors Association says Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on Gov. Ted Strickland’s watch
","
Like the refrain of a ubiquitous pop song, the phrase -- ""Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch"" -- is playing over and over on the airwaves. And like any good lyric, the phrase is catchy.

Republican U.S. Senate candidate Rob Portman sings it about his Democratic challenger Lee Fisher, who is Ohio’s lieutenant governor and former head of the state’s economic development department. Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich sings it about incumbent governor Ted Strickland.

Now the Republican Governors Association has made the phrase the central theme of three commercials attacking Strickland on behalf of Kasich.

""Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch,"" is the opening line for one of the ads.

With the phrase getting aired so often, we thought it was time to check the accuracy of the playlist.

The Republicans are referring to the state’s net job losses since Strickland -- and by extension Fisher -- took office in January 2007. Ohio lost 386,600 non-farm jobs from January 2007 through June of this year, the latest figure available. So Republicans are largely accurate when they say Ohio has lost 400,000 jobs since January of 2007. Job losses were as high as 438,900 at the end of February of this year.

But the claim breaks down when Republicans suggest that the governor -- or any one official -- is responsible for the job losses.

Ohio has been losing jobs since January of 2000 - 568,300 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of those, 403,800 came in the manufacturing sector.  

It’s also worth noting, since campaigns are trying to blame those in charge when the state lost jobs, that Republicans held the governor’s office seven of those years and held both houses of the legislatures until January 2009. Republican George W. Bush was president for eight of those years.

Strickland argues that Ohio - like Michigan and other Midwest states -- was especially hurt by forces beyond his control, namely a recession and the decline of manufacturing. Ohio and the nation have suffered through two recessions, one that started in 2001 and one that started in 2008, which triggered an avalanche of job losses here and was considered a global economic crisis.

Strickland is not the only one making this argument.

Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican elected in 2004 who is in his second term, says the same thing, at least he did July 22 during an interview in Cleveland. What makes the Daniels’ comments worth highlighting is that the rising GOP star was in town campaigning with Kasich. The two were beating up on Strickland for the state’s job losses.

But Daniels became a bit defensive when questioned about Hoosier State less than stellar performance in the last several years. Indiana lost 174,000 net jobs since January of 2007 and the state has a current unemployment rate of 10.1 percentage points compared to Ohio’s 10.5 rate.

""In a time when every state that is not sitting on a pile of natural gas is struggling, you bet we are,"" Daniels said. He argued that Indiana is adding jobs faster than other states and its ""business climate"" is better than Ohio’s. But, echoing the sentiments of other governors in defense of their states’ economic woes, he said, ""To some extent, everybody is at the mercy of national and global events, and we are no different.""

That’s right. Daniels delivered the line that many Democrats make to defend themselves from the charge that the state’s job losses are all their fault.

So even if the campaign phrase -- ""Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch"" -- is stuck in a voter’s head, the claim does not reflect the larger economic backdrop, one that both Democrats and Republicans in charge of states admit produced results out of their control.

If the roles were reversed, and Ohio were led by a Republican governor and it was Democrats making the accusation, our rating would be the same.

We find the Republican Governors Association claim to be Half True.

"['Afghanistan', 'National', 'Iraq', 'Military', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Paul Krugman']","
Number deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan show one war got a lot more troops
","The war in Afghanistan was the main topic on This Week with Christiane Amanpour on Aug. 1, 2010.

Liberal economist Paul Krugman noted that ongoing problems in Afghanistan should actually be pinned on the Bush administration.

""You know, when I look at this, people say, you know, 'We can't abandon Afghanistan,' all that,"" Krugman said. ""I'm surprised that people aren't pointing out that basically the decision to abandon Afghanistan was taken eight years ago, right? Eight years ago, when the Taliban was on the run, when it might have been possible to really use the momentum to change this, that's when the Bush administration pulled the troops out of Afghanistan, pulled the resources away, because they wanted to invade Iraq instead. And now you're asking Obama to recover from a situation where we've spent eight years losing credibility.""

We were interested in fact-checking Krugman's statement that ""the Bush administration pulled the troops out of Afghanistan, pulled the resources away, because they wanted to invade Iraq instead.""

To do this, we checked troop levels in Afghanistan from eight years ago, using monthly estimated numbers provided by the Department of Defense. (We're counting just U.S. troops here, not NATO forces.)

What we found is that troop levels were basically static during the invasion and occupation of Iraq. But we were surprised by the relatively small number of troops that were in Afghanistan eight years ago. In October 2002, there were approximately 9,500 troops there. A year later, in October 2003, that number had increased slightly to 10,400. Meanwhile, in Iraq in October 2003, there were 130,800 troops.

In Afghanistan, the number of U.S. troops stayed below 20,000 for all of 2003, 2004 and 2005. In 2006, it hit a high for the year of 23,300 in April.

President George W. Bush announced a surge for Iraq in 2007. The number of troops in Iraq climbed above 60,000, while U.S. troops in Afghanistan hovered between 10,000 and 11,000. In 2008, the number of troops in Afghanistan started increasing to between 16,000 and 18,000.

The number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan increased dramatically in 2009, the year President Barack Obama took office. By the end of 2009, troops numbered just over 67,000. And right now, there are approximately 89,000 troops.

So Krugman said that ""the Bush administration pulled the troops out of Afghanistan"" eight years ago, but we could not document any declines until the surge in Iraq in 2007.

Experts said Krugman was right about resources being pulled away, though, particularly intelligence operations and elite Special Forces units. (We can't quantify these shifts with data because the government considers it sensitive operational information; however, all the experts we consulted agreed on this point.)

""It was the kind of troops that we pulled out,"" said Marvin Weinbaum, a former Afghanistan specialist at the State Department and now a scholar at the Middle East Institute. ""We pulled out special forces units and they were not replaced by similar kinds of units.""

""It's more that valuable and scarce intelligence assets, Special Forces, and high command and political attention shifted to Iraq from Afghanistan. It's not overall troops that matter as much in this case,"" said Ivan Eland, a senior fellow at the Independent Institute, a libertarian think tank, and author of an upcoming book on counterinsurgency warfare.

""I think it would be more accurate to suggest that the Bush administration failed to reinforce the Afghan mission once it began to focus on Iraq,"" said Doug Bandow of the libertarian Cato Institute. ""So Krugman was technically wrong on troop levels but correct in terms of some specialized forces as well as a larger strategic sense.""

To add one more wrinkle: The experts we consulted also said that the situation in Afghanistan started deteriorating significantly in 2006 and 2007, years after the invasion of Iraq. That's a point when Afghanistan could have used more troops but didn't get them.

""By 2006/2007 when we saw the Taliban begin to return, we might have beefed up forces in Afghanistan much more quickly -- except that we were tied down still (and in fact, surging) in Iraq,"" said Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

So to sum up, Krugman said the Bush administration ""pulled the troops out of Afghanistan, pulled the resources away, because they wanted to invade Iraq instead."" He's right on the substantive point that the U.S. was waging war in two countries with limited resources, and Iraq got the bulk of those resources. And experts said that key assets including intelligence operations and Special Forces units were pulled away from Afghanistan for the Iraq invasion. But he's wrong that troop levels in Afghanistan declined when Iraq was invaded in March 2003. The numbers in Afghanistan were small, and they stayed small until they declined later, in 2007. As a result, we rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB67F80>],/factchecks/2010/aug/03/paul-krugman/number-deployed-iraq-and-afghanistan-show-one-war-/

Olens says he beat ACLU in Cobb prayer case
","
Republican attorney general candidate Sam Olens recently fought back against critics questioning his conservative credentials.

He is locked in an Aug. 10 runoff with Preston Smith for the Republican Party's nomination for attorney general. The winner takes on Democrat Ken Hodges in the Nov. 2 general election.

Olens, the former Cobb County Commission chairman, released a campaign ad a few weeks ago to show he's as conservative as the other guys in the race. The television ad focused on the county's legal battle with the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued Olens, the Cobb Board of Commissioners and its Planning Commission primarily over the way invocations are done at their meetings.

""In Cobb County, every meeting opened with a prayer,"" the ad began with ominous music. ""The ACLU objected. Sued.""

The voice in the ad says, ""Olens took on the ACLU and won!""

Jeffrey Selman, a plaintiff in the lawsuit, has said Olens made erroneous claims in the ad.

He distributed a letter to ""set the presently distorted record straight. At best, for all concerned, the decision was a draw."" The Olens campaign insists the ad is correct.

So who's right here?

Let's begin with a recap about the case. Selman and four other men filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in August 2005. The plaintiffs said in the complaint they objected to Cobb's practice of allowing speakers at most of their commission meetings to begin with an invocation with references to a ""Christian God -- to the exclusion of all other Gods.""

""The plaintiffs are affronted by the defendants' overtly Christian prayers ... and unwelcome religious messages sponsored by the county,"" the complaint said.

The plaintiffs had a similar complaint about Planning Commission meetings. ""Since February 2003, only two non-Christian clergy has given the invocation at the Board of Commissioner Zoning meetings. None of these prayers included sectarian references.""

Olens and others countered that legal precedent, specifically a 1983 U.S. Supreme Court case, found the content of prayer is of no concern, unless it is used to disparage one faith or advance another.

The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2008 that the Cobb commission did allow religious leaders of other faiths to offer prayers at meetings and that those prayers do not advance one faith or disparage another. The court did rule that the process the Planning Commission used in its invocation process excluded minority faiths during a certain period. Olens did not preside over Planning Commission meetings.

Selman and the plaintiffs contend that the ad is misleading because it suggests that they were upset about Cobb commissioners allowing prayer in their meetings. Olens said the ad is not misleading because Selman gave testimony complaining about prayer in the commission meetings. The Olens campaign provided PolitiFact Georgia with what it considered the smoking gun, eight pages of an April 24, 2006, deposition by Selman.

""If any prayer is specifically identified with any particular religion, whether or not it names the deity of the religion, it would be a prohibited prayer from your approach?"" Selman was asked.

""Yes,"" Selman said, according to the transcript.

""I admit it. That's me talking,"" Selman, who is Jewish, told PolitiFact Georgia. ""But I recognized [those changes were not] going to happen.""

Selman gave PolitiFact Georgia the entire 160-page deposition. In it, Selman argues several times in that deposition in favor of allowing people of various religious faiths to give the invocation at County Commission meetings. 

The court did rule in favor of the County Commission, so we find that the claim in the Olens ad that he ""took on the ACLU and won"" is correct. However, we had trouble with the language in the first part of the ad, ""every meeting opened with a prayer. The ACLU objected. Sued."" The plaintiffs objected in their complaint to the types of prayer at the beginning of the meeting. That part of the ad suggests the plaintiffs objected to any type of prayer, which PolitiFact Georgia found is misleading. We rate the Olens statement as Half-True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC95E4C0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/03/sam-olens/olens-says-he-beat-aclu-cobb-prayer-case/

Pam Bondi says mortgage fraud is up 400 percent
","
At their first televised debate, the three Republican candidates for attorney general got a chance to address why fraud seemed to be so rampant in Florida and what they, if elected, would do to stop it.

Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp talked about Medicaid fraud, and how the state must do a better job recouping that money. Former Agency for Health Care Administration secretary Holly Benson talked about Florida being ranked No. 1 in terms of automobile accident fraud.

Former Hillsborough prosecutor Pam Bondi then zeroed in on mortgage fraud.

""Mortgage fraud is through the roof,"" Bondi said during the hour-long debate taped on July 31, 2010, for Bay News 9 in Tampa Bay and CFN 13 in Orlando and broadcast the following day. ""It's up 400 percent in the last five years. That's outrageous. We shouldn't have to be dealing with that.""

It's a simple, but staggering assertion -- and one we thought was worth exploring.

First things first, Bondi's campaign told us she was referring to nationwide statistics and not just Florida. That's an important distinction because the question was related to Florida.

Still, the campaign turned us to a Department of Treasury fraud report to back up her claim. Using FBI statistics, Treasury said that the FBI investigated more than 2,100 mortgage fraud cases in 2009, a 400 percent increase from five years ago (Page 7 of the report). The report, dated June 14, 2010, attributes the rise in mortgage fraud investigations to ""declining economic conditions,"" ""liberal underwriting"" and ""declining home values.""

The FBI's own report produces slightly different numbers, but a similar percentage increase.

From 2005-2009, the FBI reported its mortgage fraud investigations increased from 721 to 2,794 -- a 387.5 percent increase. From 2006-2010, the pending mortgage fraud investigations are 3,029 -- which would translate to a nearly 344 percent increase over that five-year period.

You can see the bureau's entire report on mortgage fraud here, which includes descriptions on current mortgage fraud scams. In a credit enhancement scheme, for example, a mortgage fraud perpetrator artificially boosts a borrower's credit to qualify him for a loan. Other types of fraud include bogus appraisals, or fake foreclosure rescue schemes.

The FBI reports that mortgage fraud is particularly an issue in Florida.

In 2009, the Tampa FBI field office opened more mortgage fraud investigations than any other FBI office in the country, the FBI said. Mortgage fraud investigations spiked 363 percent in Tampa in one year, according to the FBI, from 41 in 2008 to 190 in 2009.

Florida also ranked first in the nation in same-day property flips, according to the FBI. (An exchange of property that occurs on the day of sale is considered suspect for illegal property flipping).

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has used the FBI data to make the case for additional resources and legislation to combat mortgage fraud, and in particular noted that FBI investigations are up ""almost 400 percent from five years ago.""

But the FBI isn't the only agency that investigates mortgage fraud.

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which is part of the Department of Treasury, collects and tracks Suspicious Activity Reports of mortgage fraud that are submitted anonymously from financial institutions across the country. The Suspicious Activity Reports are like tips, said spokesman Bill Grassano. Those tips can either lead to investigations by some 300 law enforcement agencies across the country, or help identify trends. In other cases, there was no crime.

Reports of possible mortgage fraud increased from 25,931 in 2005 to 67,360 in 2009, according to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. That's a big increase, about 260 percent, but not as large as the increase in investigations reported by the FBI.

We also checked in with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to see if the agency had any statewide numbers. FDLE spokeswoman Heather Smith said the agency does not track specifically the number of mortgage fraud cases statewide. Smith provided PolitiFact Florida with two FDLE mortgage fraud assessment reports, from 2005 and 2007, that use both FBI investigation figures and the Suspicious Activity Reports to highlight national trends.

Back to Bondi's statement. She said mortgage fraud is up ""400 percent in the last five years."" Bondi has her numbers right, but the nearly 400 percent increase is referring specifically to FBI investigations of mortgage fraud nationwide, and does not account for state and local investigations, or information collected through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Bondi could have been more specific with where her figure was coming from. As such, we rate her statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC030880>],/factchecks/2010/aug/02/pam-bondi/pam-bondi-says-mortgage-fraud-400-percent/
"['Disability', 'Florida', 'Florida Democratic Party']","
Florida Democrats focus on Bill McCollum's ADA votes
","
Gubernatorial hopeful Bill McCollum has been in politics for much of his adult life, charting a wide map of potential minefields for his enemies to use against him.

The Florida Democratic Party, no stranger to partisan warfare, took such aim in a July 26, 2010, press release, using the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act to remind voters of McCollum's initial concerns about the sweeping civil rights legislation.

""Earlier this year, McCollum said he was proud of his efforts to pass the ADA when he was in Congress, noting there was 'Great Resistance' to the bill. McCollum neglected to state that he was a major player in the 'Great Resistance,' "" wrote party spokesman Eric Jotkoff in the press release.

The press release goes on, ""He urged then-President George H.W. Bush to reconsider his support of the ADA ... McCollum also voted for numerous amendments to weaken the legislation, even voting to make trains less accessible to those in wheelchairs. McCollum then voted for final passage of the ADA, saying 'politically, it's a very tough vote.' ""

The Americans with Disabilities Act, signed into law July 26, 1990, is considered one of the nation's most important civil rights victories. It requires that disabled Americans be provided reasonable access to employment, transportation, public buildings and communications services. It is widely supported by Republicans and Democrats alike, although some conservatives, libertarians and business groups have long expressed concern that the law puts an undue burden on public servants and employers to accommodate the disabled.

The Democrats' claim that McCollum, who represented Florida in Congress for two decades, tried to water down the legislation and didn't want to help people in wheelchairs is an emotional charge. We wondered, is it true?

In fact, congressional records show McCollum voted for several amendments to the bill.

He supported Amendment 448, which would have specified that the costs required to accommodate the employment of a disabled person not exceed 10 percent of the annual salary or the annualized hourly wage of that job. In debate, McCollum said the amendment, ""may be the most significant one from the standpoint of mitigating the cost to small business."" It failed 187-213 on May 17, 1990. ""Today, we are going to say that a company manager who earns $40,000 is entitled to a greater accommodation that the mail clerk who receives a salary of $15,000?"" argued Rep. Dwayne Payne, D-N.J., according to congressional records.

On May 22, 1990, the day the legislation passed in the House, records show McCollum voted for Amendment 452, which sought to exempt commuter rail services from the requirement that all new rail cars be readily accessible by persons with disabilities if the commuter rail service made at least one car per train accessible for the disabled. To qualify for the exemption, a rail service would have to add more accessible cars if the demand could not be met by just one car. Proponents of the rail amendment argued that the change offered more specific requirements, albeit different ones, than the original bill, and therefore provided greater protection. For example, the bill required all new purchased or leased buses and rail cars be accessible to the disabled but did not require retrofitting of existing vehicles. The amendment, singled out by the Florida Democratic Party in its press release, failed 110-290. The New York Times wrote at the time, ""opponents said the effect of the proposed changes would be to segregate people with disabilities.""

McCollum also voted for Amendment 453 that day, which sought to provide an annual exemption to public transit systems in urban areas with populations of less than 200,000 from the bill's requirement that new vehicles be accessible to people with disabilities, including wheelchair users. To qualify for the exemption, the transit system would have to develop an alternative plan, such as a Dial-a-Ride service. ""It is the people who need to get from their home to where they want to go, the people who cannot get to the bus stop, are the people who are going to suffer,"" said sponsor Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Penn. The amendment failed 148-266. ""A civil right to equal transportation services does not diminish according to a city's population in the latest census,"" said Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., according to Congressional Quarterly.

Finally, McCollum voted for Amendment 454, which sought to keep plaintiffs from suing for monetary damages by limiting the remedies available to discrimination victims to those provided under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, such as injunctive relief, back pay and attorney fees. Supporters argued the disabled should not have greater remedies than those available to women and minorities under the 1964 law. The amendment failed 192-227. ""You have lesser rights if you have lesser remedies,"" said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., at the time, according to Congressional Quarterly.

On that amendment, McCollum argued at the time: ""The real problem I have had with the ADA bill altogether, and I am going to vote for this bill, even though a lot of people think that I am out here with a lot of amendments and I am opposed, I am not, because I think the disabled need to have a civil rights bill like this one. I think the problem we have had all along has been costs. It has been a question of how do we mitigate, how do we reduce, costs. It is far more complex under the civil rights legislation for the handicapped than it is for race or sex or any other kind of discrimination. There may be as many as 900, some people say, 900 different disabilities covered by this legislation. There are innumerable different situations in the workplace where the handicapped of different types will intermesh, and those situations will have to be resolved hopefully through processes that are short of litigation. It will be expensive, and even if there is a resolution occasionally by litigation, that will undoubtedly be a very expensive route.""

McCollum then joined the majority to pass the legislation in a 403-20 vote.

So, would the amendments he supported have weakened the legislation? The McCollum campaign did not respond to our questions on this point.

But many experts on disability law said the amendments did attempt to undercut the bill.

""These amendments sought to narrow the rights provided to individuals with disabilities,"" said Ruth Colker, author of The Disability Pendulum: The First Decade of the Americans with Disabilities Act and a law professor at Ohio State University.

The amendments were ""more pro business and anti-worker,"" said Paul Steven Miller, a University of Washington law professor and a former commissioner on the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency that enforces employment discrimination laws. ""They sort of run counter to what the ADA seeks to accomplish.""

We also checked whether the law was eventually altered to reflect the amendments supported by McCollum. It wasn't. To this day, Americans with disabilities can sue for monetary damages, there is no fiscal cap on how much an employer may spend to accommodate a disabled employer, and transportation systems still must be accessible.

To be sure, the Americans with Disabilities Act does have its critics.

After the legislation's passage, the libertarian Cato Institute published a policy analysis by economist Robert O'Quinn, that concluded, ""the ADA so zealously pursues its mainstreaming goal that individuals, businesses, and governmental bodies must make expensive accommodations to ensure full integration even when less costly, more convenient alternatives, which are preferred by disabled individuals, are available.""

He continued, ""The ADA is objectionable on moral as well as economic grounds. In a free society the government should employ its coercive powers only to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens from aggression. Any attempt to enforce moral behavior, however noble or desirable, is beyond the proper scope of government.""

In contrast, some advocates of the bill have complained that it did not go far enough.

Our mission, however, is not to judge the value of the acclaimed legislation.

The Florida Democratic Party claimed McCollum ""voted for numerous amendments to weaken the legislation, even voting to make trains less accessible to those in wheelchairs."" We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC018600>],/factchecks/2010/aug/02/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-focus-mccollums-record/
"['National', 'Economy', 'This Week - ABC News', 'George Will']","
George Will says personal saving rate has increased during recession
","During the Aug. 1, 2010, roundtable on ABC's This Week, host Christiane Amanpour asked panelists about the current levels of slow growth in the United States economy. ""Growth is happening,"" Amanpour said, ""but at 2.4 percent, which is slower than most people wanted. I see you shaking your head in this debate. The Financial Times is basically saying that the deficit talk is a phony, rhetorical war and that actually stimulus has had some effect.""

She turned to George Will, the conservative columnist, who had been shaking his head. ""Well, the recovery is now more than a year old, and we know two things about it,"" Will said. ""It's unusually weak for a recovery after a severe downturn, and, B, starting weak, it's getting weaker, for two reasons. First of all, the stimulus is running out. ... Cash for Clunkers has come and gone. The homebuyer's tax credit for purchasing new -- particularly new homes, come and gone. Second, the growth so far has been largely driven by inventories, businesses rebuilding their inventories in anticipation of the consumer -- 70 percent of business activity in a normal time -- coming back to the malls. The trouble is, the consumer in his native perversity has begun to save. The savings rate is now 6.2 percent. So what you have is what I think Keynes called the paradox of thrift. ... It's a virtue until it isn't a virtue.""

We thought it would be worthwhile to check whether the savings rate has in fact risen to 6.2 percent during the recession.

Checking the number itself was easy. We looked to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, which tracks the personal saving rate, which it defines as the percentage of personal disposable income that is saved. The data shows that during the second quarter of 2010, the personal saving rate was about 6.2 percent, just as Will had said.

Will is also right to suggest that the rate has risen. The current rate is the second highest it has been in any quarter since at least 2004, which is the earliest data BEA offers on the chart we found. Prior to the start of the recession in 2008, the saving rate was typically below 4 percent, and much of the time it was below 2 percent. In other words, consumers today are hoarding significantly more of their income than they were during the go-go days of high real estate values, easy credit and a steadily growing economy.

So Will is right on the facts. But we were also intrigued about whether the higher savings rate has hampered the nation's economic recovery, as he suggests.

Let's begin by explaining the ""paradox of thrift"" that Will cited. The major tenet is that when people save a lot of money, rather than spend it, they help their own bottom lines -- but that if everyone follows that approach, then everybody loses. According to the theory, the money saved doesn't get injected into the economy, where it would boost production and profits and help create jobs. In other words, a higher personal savings rate, like the one Will is talking about, can actually hurt the economy even as it helps individuals live within their means and hedge against personal economic setbacks.

We checked with a cross-section of economists to see whether they thought this theory -- which was popularized by  left-of-center economist John Maynard Keynes -- is generally considered accurate today. The experts we talked to said that it has broad, but not universal, approval.

Most of the skepticism about the paradox of thrift has come from the right. Conservative economist Dan Mitchell of the libertarian Cato Institute said that free-market economics doesn't dispute that higher saving leads to lower consumption, but it places less importance on that shift. Free-marketers say that as long as the national income is growing, then the displacement of consumption by savings doesn't matter that much.

J.D. Foster, a senior fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that when Keynes popularized the concept in the early 20th century, the money that was ""saved"" was actually stuck in the proverbial mattress, at which point it really did leave the economic system. By contrast, there are many relatively safe options for parking one's money today, even accounting for the shakiness in the financial sector since 2008. And if a higher savings rate means that people are putting their money into banks or other safe investments, that money makes its way back into the economy as capital available to lend. In turn, greater availability of loans can help juice the economy.

That said, there are still many defenders of the original Keynesian view of the paradox of thrift. They cite real-world evidence from the past few years, in which investment has fallen compared to pre-recession levels despite historically low interest rates.

""Businesses and households evidently do not want to invest as much in 2010 as they did in 2007"" because they're not confident those investments will pay off, said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. ""Of course, one reason for their lack of confidence is the very slow growth in household consumption, which is a byproduct of the rise in household saving rates. On the surface, then, the facts tend to support the broad version of the paradox of thrift. The jump in the household saving rate has thus been harmful to economic growth, at least in the short run.""

We'll acknowledge that there's a difference of opinion in how economists view the impact of the saving rate's growth during the recession. But on Will's core factual assertion -- that the savings rate has climbed during the recession -- he's correct. So we rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8FBE40>],/factchecks/2010/aug/02/george-will/george-will-says-personal-saving-rate-has-increase/
"['Ohio', 'Cap and Trade', 'Climate Change', 'Economy', 'Energy', 'Rob Portman']","
Portman uses outdated context to claim cap-and-trade could cost 100,000 Ohio jobs
","The only thing better than accusing an opponent of losing jobs in Ohio’s hard-pressed economy is linking him or his party to proposals that might cause even higher Buckeye State unemployment.

That’s what Rob Portman, the Republican running for U.S. Senate, attempts in a TV commercial that says a ""job-killer"" energy tax is ""coming our way from Washington.""

""It could cost Ohio 100,000 jobs we cannot afford to lose,"" Portman says in the ad.

Portman’s concern is shared by business leaders, especially manufacturers. But he nearly steers a legitimate concern off the rails with his 100,000 job-loss figure.

The ""energy tax"" would come from a proposed bill to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Though the so-called cap-and-trade bill would not specifically impose a tax, it’s clear enough what Portman means. The bill would limit carbon emissions while creating a trading system so companies that cut their carbon output – by burning less coal, for instance – could sell their unneeded carbon credits. Companies that needed to exceed the caps could buy those credits.

Unless there was generous help to companies in coal-reliant states like Ohio, a cap-and-trade bill could hurt, because there aren’t enough alternatives right now to coal-fired electricity.

""The fact is that any carbon legislation is designed to make us not use coal,"" says Kevin Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington. ""So if you’re a state that has a lot of coal, you’re going to get hammered.""

Theoretically then, Portman’s broad fear is not off the mark, although various studies and analyses make conflicting claims. But Portman strays by claiming the cost could be 100,000 Ohio jobs, and by saying the bill ""is coming our way.""

His job-loss figure comes from an analysis of a bill that the House of Representatives passed last year. Two problems:
  
  
""I sure wouldn’t want to bet the farm on it,"" says Stephen Hess, a senior fellow emeritus at the Brookings Institution, a centrist-liberal think tank. ""I don’t think I’d even want to bet a weekend at Atlantic City.""

The House bill was sponsored by liberal members Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Henry Waxman of California. Senate Democrats don’t have enough of a majority to just rubber-stamp the Waxman-Markey bill, and Democrats like Brown are insisting on better economic protections for coal-reliant states. The campaign of Lee Fisher, Portman’s Democratic rival in the Senate race, says Fisher too believes the Waxman-Markey bill would harm Ohio unless it got better protections.

That doesn’t mean a compromise cannot be fashioned, and several are on the table. One would require provisions to keep foreign manufacturers that don’t have carbon restrictions from gaining advantage and taking jobs from the United States. Another would grant extra carbon credits to keep companies in Ohio and similar states from paying too much while they transitioned to greener energy sources. Yet another, being considered as a separate bill that has President Barack Obama’s support, would create clean-energy manufacturing grants to help companies develop jobs in wind, solar and other alternative energy sources.

Different interest groups, economists and lawmakers use different analyses to project the potential job losses or gains from these proposals. The Peterson Institute for International Economics said in May that a climate-change measure introduced by Sen. John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, would prompt enough clean-energy investment in its first decade to add 203,000 new jobs nationally. But higher energy and product prices in the second decade would offset those job gains, the Peterson economists said.

Economists at the University of California at Berkeley had a more optimistic take, saying that adoption of a House-style bill could add as many as 1.9 million jobs nationwide – with 35,000 to 61,000 of those in Ohio – by 2020. That is assuming that states have ""balanced policies"" that utilize not only a cap-and-trade system but also complementary policies for energy efficiency and clean technology, the authors said.

For an additional take, we looked at a Congressional Budget Office analysis, published in May. The CBO examined three independent economic studies by outside groups: Brookings, Resources for the Future, and CRA International, a consulting firm. The CBO’s conclusion from these: Workers who rely on coal and other fossil fuels for their jobs would be affected, but eventually, most workers who lost jobs would find new ones.

In particular, the CBO said, a ""gradually increasing tax on greenhouse gas emissions,"" as envisioned in the Waxman-Markey bill, ""would probably only have a small effect on total employment during the next few decades.""

The CBO did not quantify that, however. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and took out our calculator. If 100,000 jobs were lost due to cap-and-trade, as Portman claims, that would represent a loss of anywhere from 2 percent to 2.4 percent of Ohio jobs, depending on how you measure today’s employment. That’s not a small effect – which would seem to put Portman’s claim at odds with the CBO’s analysis.

A loss of 100,000 jobs ""would be quite meaningful"" in terms of overall Ohio employment, says Ken Mayfield, an economist and president of ClearView Economics of Pepper Pike.

In his commercial, Portman couches his number by saying the state ""could"" lose that many jobs. And campaign spokeswoman Jessica Towhey says that Portman uses the 100,000 number because it comes from a legitimate study of the only cap-and-trade bill that has passed a chamber of Congress, making it more realistic than Senate proposals that are speculative for now. If Obama were to demand action, Towhey said, Senate Democrats could quickly line up in support and enact a final cap-and-trade bill.

But the political roadblocks to Waxman-Markey in the Senate make its passage equally speculative -- unless there are concessions for states like Ohio. And Portman chose to use the worst-case conclusion on Waxman-Markey.

In fact, last October another fact-checking outfit, Factcheck.org, affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, did its own full review of the National Association of Manufacturers’ claim. It examined the national prediction rather than those for individual states, focusing on the claim that cap-and-trade could cost up to 2.4 million jobs.

Factcheck.org turned to the same in-depth study by the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, that backers and detractors of Waxman-Markey were citing at the time. The EIA analyzed 11 different sets of assumptions, every one of which showed there would be fewer jobs in 2030 with the Waxman-Markey bill than without.

But ""only the most severely pessimistic set of assumptions"" produced job losses on the scale cited by the manufacturers, and now repeated by Portman. And remember, that was the worst case scenario from two groups that tend to support big business’ side of the issue.

That’s why we find Portman’s claim to be Barely True. Comment on this item.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA26980>],/factchecks/2010/aug/02/rob-portman/portman-uses-outdated-context-claim-cap-and-trade-/
"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Lee Fisher']","
Fisher claim that Portman failed to address China currency manipulation overlooks key facts
","
China makes the goods that Americans used to make, but that’s because politicians failed to stop China’s unfair trade practices. It’s a theme as recurrent as the buzzards returning to Hinckley, and Ohio campaign managers know it works.

But Lee Fisher’s campaign presented a new angle on the theme, and it is intriguing. Fisher, the Democratic lieutenant governor, is running for U.S. Senate against Rob Portman, a Republican who served for a year as President George W. Bush’s trade ambassador. Portman played a key advisory role in helping the president deal with economic competition from China, whose manufacturing might rose as Ohio’s declined.

You’ll hear plenty more about that before November, and The Plain Dealer examined Portman’s trade record in May. But Fisher presented a brand new perspective in a news release on July 13 when he complained about currency manipulation by China. Although this has been an issue for years, Fisher put some of the blame on Portman. His news release said, ""As President George W. Bush’s trade representative, Portman failed to address China’s currency manipulation, which was inflated to as much as 40 percent in 2006.""

That’s shorthand for saying that China propped up its currency rather than letting it rise and fall against the dollar, enabling China’s factories to make steel, auto parts and toys and ship them to the United States at artificially low prices that undercut American manufacturers. It was little different from other unfair trade practices, many American manufacturers say.

You’ll hear few disputes about that, whether the president is named Bush or Barack Obama. But there’s plenty of bickering over what to do about it. That’s where Portman comes in.

Portman, a Republican, could have used his authority as trade representative to take China to the World Trade Organization and push for penalties, according to critics. But Portman was such an unabashed proponent of free trade that he gave China a pass, Fisher says.

We asked Fisher’s spokesman, John Collins (who recently left to work for a candidate in Kentucky), to provide support for the claim, and he cited several news articles from early 2006. That’s when Portman’s office issued a lengthy and critical report on other trade practices by China. But Portman’s report gave little space to currency manipulation – and that angered Sen. Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York.

According to news articles and congressional transcripts we reviewed, Schumer blasted Portman’s report for failing to fully deal with the ""800-pound gorilla"" – currency manipulation -- that had to be tamed for any trade balance to occur.

OK, so Portman failed to adequately mention China’s currency manipulation -- according to a senator from New York -- in a report. Was that really a failure to ""address"" the problem?

It turns out the issue gets more complex.

Portman didn’t address the currency issue in the broader sense -- that is, embrace it as a problem he could solve -- because, his campaign says, it wasn’t even under his jurisdiction. Transcripts of a confirmation hearing for Portman on April 21, 2005, show that he voiced concern about the issue but said, ""By the same token, as you know, the Treasury Department has the lead on this, appropriately. It’s a currency issue, not USTR,"" he said, using the initials of U.S. Trade Representative’s office.

He mentioned the jurisdictional issue several more times during his stint as trade ambassador. On Feb. 16, 2006, he told Schumer during a Senate Finance Committee hearing that ""currency policy is very distinctly not within the ambit of the USTR. And I'm reminded of that constantly in the inter-agency process, which is appropriate that Treasury take the lead and that they speak for us on currency policy.""

Four days later he told it to another congressional committee: ""We need to address the currency issue, which the Treasury Department takes the lead on and not USTR.""

So is Fisher blaming Portman for something he bore no responsibility for?

That’s what Portman’s spokeswoman, Jessica Towhey, suggested, citing the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The act says it is the Treasury secretary’s job to analyze exchange rate policies of other countries, in consultation with the International Monetary Fund, and consider whether countries manipulate their currencies. If the answer is yes, Treasury is to negotiate with the offending country through the IMF.

We contacted the office of the current trade representative, Ron Kirk, an Obama appointee, to see if it agreed on the jurisdiction issue. It did. We asked Treasury as well, and Treasury said it was in fact in charge. We asked the Obama White House, too, just in case the agencies had a fuzzy view. No, said the White House. Currency manipulation is on Treasury’s watch.

That cast significant doubt on Fisher’s claim, then, that Portman ""failed to address"" the problem. It wasn’t his job.

But we wondered if small American manufacturers agreed, so we asked a few trade experts in Washington, including attorneys who take cases to the trade courts. It turned out that the story was more complex, because on April 20, 2005, nine days before Portman was sworn in, a group of 35 senators and representatives filed a petition asking the trade representative’s office to haul China before the WTO and press the currency issue as an unfair trade practice. The Congress members -- nearly all Democrats -- had grown frustrated with Treasury, saying it had failed to stop China’s manipulation and that the right recourse was for the trade ambassador to go to the trade courts and ask for  tariffs against Chinese imports.

A coalition of labor unions and manufacturing groups had tried this twice before, but their petitions had been rejected. But this 2005 congressional petition was different because members of Congress filed it. They included several U.S. House members from Ohio, including Democrats Tim Ryan, Stephanie Tubbs Jones (since deceased), Sherrod Brown (now a senator) and Ted Strickland (now Ohio’s governor). They also included a dozen U.S. senators, including one from Illinois named Barack Obama.

On May 27, 2005, not quite a month into his term, Portman’s office turned them down.

His spokesman at the agency, Richard Mills, said at the time that the Treasury secretary, John Snow, had the lead in talks with China on the currency matter and, as a result, ""Chinese officials have publicly committed that they will move to a more flexible system.""

A notice in the Federal Register said the trade office turned down the lawmakers’ request ""because, among other reasons, an investigation would not be effective in addressing the acts, policies, and practices covered in the petition."" The Bush administration was already dealing with China through Treasury, and launching a trade office investigation ""would hamper, rather than advance, administration efforts to address China’s currency valuation policies.""

Neither Mills’ statement nor the Federal Register notice said it was strictly a matter of jurisdiction. Mills said at the time that many tools were available ""to ensure a level playing field,"" but that the administration preferred to put Treasury in the lead.

This suggested some leeway on choice, not just jurisdiction, or so say the parties who wanted the trade representative’s involvement. ""That is a major issue, and we’ve always argued that it is a hybrid issue,"" says David Hartquist, a Washington trade attorney who had filed a similar petition earlier that was turned down by a Portman predecessor..

Charles Blum, a trade office official in the 1980s who is now executive director of the Fair Currency Coalition, representing manufacturers, labor and agricultural interests, says that Portman ""was essentially saying, ‘I refuse to enforce the law because diplomacy is the proper venue.’""

The question then becomes: Did Portman lack jurisdiction, or did he just believe that Treasury was the better agency to deal with the issue?

Kevin Dempsey, a trade lawyer and senior vice president at the American Iron and Steel Institute, which also has tried to halt unfairly priced imports, says that Congress has been fairly clear: It intended for Treasury to take the lead. Portman ""had some discretion,"" Dempsey says. ""But it’s been established for some years, before Portman and after Portman, that Treasury does have the lead.""

Congress has considered changing that so currency could be treated as a trade issue in certain circumstances. Ryan and Brown are involved in  these efforts. But their measures have stalled repeatedly.  And now that he’s president, even Obama has kept Treasury in the lead – and frustrated  those who want more forceful action.

So we’re persuaded that in a narrow sense, Portman ""failed to address China’s currency manipulation,"" as Fisher’s campaign says. But he was following a long-held policy that has been articulated by Congress and presidents. The Obama administration agrees with Portman: Currency is not the trade ambassador’s job. And Portman ""addressed"" it repeatedly in congressional hearings, telling Congress exactly what his campaign says today. 
That’s why we rate Fisher’s claim Barely True.

Republican Party of Texas says President Barack Obama lied when he said the mandate to obtain health insurance was not a tax
","
Channeling U.S. Rep Joe Wilson, the Republican from South Carolina who shouted ""You lie!"" during President Barack Obama's speech to Congress in September, the Republican Party of Texas has accused the president of lying when he said that a new federal mandate requiring individuals to have health insurance was not a tax. 
""You lie!"" the party tweeted July 19. ""Obama said O-care mandate wasn't a tax. Now Obama admin says it is a tax."" 
Did the Obama administration talk one way and then the other? 
Per the legislation that Obama signed into law in March, most people will be required to have health insurance starting in 2014. There are exceptions, but individuals who aren't exempt and refuse to join a plan will be required to pay an annual penalty of $695 per person, up to a maximum of $2,085 per family, or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is greater. The health care law calls the fine individuals must pay if they don't have insurance a ""penalty."" 
In a Sept. 20, 2009, interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos, Obama denied that the mandate to buy health insurance was equivalent to a tax. ""For us to say that you've got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase,"" Obama said. He noted that Americans are required to have auto insurance, but nobody considers that a tax increase. (Auto insurance is a state mandate, but all the states except New Hampshire require it of resident drivers.) 
When Stephanopoulos pressed Obama on whether the mandate was a tax, Obama said: ""I absolutely reject that notion."" 
However, on July 16 The New York Times published a story that seemed to vindicate opponents of the health care overhaul who argued that the insurance requirement was a tax. The headline: ""Changing stance, administration now defends insurance mandate as a tax."" 
Texas is one of 21 states challenging the law's constitutionality in court, but Virginia was the first to face the federal government in a July 1 hearing on its lawsuit. The New York Times pointed to a brief filed in that case by the U.S. Department of Justice defending the individual mandate as ""a valid exercise"" of the federal government's ""power to lay and collect taxes."" Congress can impose taxes to provide for the ""general welfare"" under Article I of the Constitution. 
From the health-care law: ""The requirement regulates activity that is commercial and economic in nature: economic and financial decisions about how and when health care is paid for, and when health insurance is purchased."" The law then says that national health spending is projected to increase from $2.5 trillion — 17.6 percent of the economy — in 2009, to $4.7 trillion in 2019. 
In its legal brief, the department says the penalty is also a tax because it will raise revenue — $4 billion a year by 2017, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — and because it's imposed and collected under the Internal Revenue Code. Individuals who refuse to obtain health insurance and are penalized will have to report the fine ""as an addition to income tax liability,"" the brief says. 
The health care law itself doesn't mention Congress' taxing authority, instead noting that the mandate is protected under the Constitution's Article I ""commerce clause,"" which lets Congress regulate commercial activity that has a substantial effect on the national economy. 
""The tax argument is the strongest argument,"" the Times quoted Jack Balkin, a professor at Yale Law School who supports the law, saying. ""This bill is a tax. Because it's a tax, it's completely constitutional."" Balkin is also quoted saying that Obama ""has not been honest with the American people about the nature of the bill."" 
White House spokesman Matt Lehrich defended the law both ways last week, telling us: ""We believe that the Commerce Clause provides ample constitutional authority for the individual mandate. If anyone has any doubts about that — and we don’t think they should — it’s also clear that that the mandate is constitutional under Congress’s power to tax."" 
Similarly, Steven Schwinn, an associate professor of constitutional law at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago, pointed out on his blog July 18 that the Obama administration has consistently defended the mandate in court primarily under the Commerce Clause, and secondarily under Congress' taxing power to promote the general welfare. 
Henry Aaron, a scholar who specializes in health care and tax policy at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution, said Obama was correct to say the mandate isn't a tax. ""A mandate is meaningless unless it is backed up by some 'or else,' as in 'obey the mandate or else,' "" Aaron said. ""The administration asserted the legal power to impose a mandate. The mandate is backed up by a tax that has to be paid if the mandate is violated. You obey the mandate or you pay the tax."" 
Upshot: In his interview with Stephanopoulos, Obama insisted the mandate to purchase health coverage is not a tax. But in defending its legality, the Justice Department argues in part that the mandate is a valid exercise of Congress' taxing power. 
From where we sit, Obama was trying to make a political point; the Justice Department, a legal one. 
In its tweet, the Republican Party overreaches when it says the administration now calls the mandate a tax. The administration (still) isn't doing that. But it does cite Congress' power to levy taxes as authority for the mandate. 
And that enables the GOP to score its own political point, based on what looks like the administration's runs at having it both ways. 
We rate the GOP's recap of Obama's early position and his administration's recent defense of the law as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC402C0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/02/republican-party-texas/republican-party-texas-says-president-barack-obama/

Trey Radel's cocaine conviction means he isn't qualified to drive a school bus, sheriff says
","U.S. Rep. Trey Radel, R-Fort Myers, is back to work in Congress following a few weeks in rehab after he got busted for cocaine possession in Washington. He’s lucky he has that job, some say. With a drug arrest on his record, he wouldn’t be eligible for a host of other gigs -- like driving a bus in his own district. Radel’s conviction prompted some high-profile Republicans to call for his ouster. Lee County Sheriff Mike Scott, who was mentioned as a potential opponent, announced on Facebook Jan. 11 that he won’t run. But Scott vowed to be a ""staunch advocate for his political replacement"" and unleashed this attack: ""While Radel returned to his congressional office following a microwave stint in rehab and a gaggle of rehearsed apologies, I have hundreds of inmates in our jail that are unable to return to their home due to similar or lesser drug offenses,"" Scott said on Facebook. ""The sad reality is that Trey Radel does not even qualify to drive a Lee County school bus at this point, yet he occupies a seat in Congress....."" Scott’s Facebook post was reported by multiple news outlets. Is Scott correct that Radel’s cocaine possession conviction means he would not meet the qualifications to drive a Lee County school bus? Radel’s misdemeanor conviction On Oct. 29, Radel was nabbed after he bought 3.5 grams of cocaine for $260 from an undercover agent in the District of Columbia. He then brought agents to his apartment where he handed over a vial of cocaine. Radel kept his case quiet until it reached court a few weeks later -- and then the news exploded about the 37-year-old TV reporter turned tea party freshman busted for cocaine. (We emailed a Radel spokesman to alert him to our fact-check and did not get a reply.) On Nov. 20, Radel pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cocaine possession and was sentenced to one year of probation. Radel spent about a month in rehab and returned to Congress in early January. Radel was charged under the District of Columbia’s Uniformed Controlled Substances Act, which divides controlled substances into five graded schedules, U.S. Attorney spokesman William Miller told PolitiFact. ""The most dangerous controlled substances are contained in Schedule I, with incrementally less serious offenses in Schedules II through V. Cocaine -- both in crack and powder form -- is in Schedule II. Possession of any controlled substance other than PCP without intent to distribute is a misdemeanor,"" Miller said in an email. Possession with intent to distribute most controlled substances would result in a felony. In 2012, the U.S. attorney in D.C. charged 700 people with misdemeanor possession of cocaine. Most pleaded guilty like Radel and entered a diversion program or had their cases dismissed. Only a small fraction received jail time (Radel didn’t). If Radel had been arrested for cocaine possession in Florida, he would have faced a felony. ""Possession of cocaine in any amount is a felony in Florida,"" Scott said in an email. Three and a half grams ""would constitute a third-degree felony, while greater quantities and/or trafficking amounts can escalate the degree of seriousness."" In Florida, ""even residue is a felony,"" said Broward public defender Howard Finkelstein. Some Florida counties don’t prosecute residue cases, but prosecutors do in Broward, and first-time offenders typically get adjudication withheld and probation, he said. Across the country, a misdemeanor drug possession statute isn’t unusual, though felonies appear to be more of the norm. Last year, California considered a bill that would have made possession a ""wobbler,"" meaning it could have been charged as a misdemeanor or a felony. A bill analysis said that 13 states plus the District of Columbia have misdemeanor drug possession laws. (Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed the bill.) There are differences in states’ laws depending on whether it relates to a first-time offender, the particular drug or other factors. ""Every state gets to totally make up its own penal code, and it shows,"" said Margaret Dooley-Sammuli, a senior policy advocate for the American Civil Liberties Union in California, which advocated for the bill. School bus drivers On the unlikely chance that Radel plans to apply to be a Lee County school district bus driver, would his conviction mean he wouldn’t qualify? Lee County school district won’t hire an individual -- including a bus driver -- who has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor drug charge less than five years ago or a felony drug charge less than 10 years old, or someone who is currently on probation, said Ranice Monroe, the school district’s director of professional standards and equity. Even if a defendant gets an adjudication withheld, the district won’t hire the individual, Monroe said. ""Our standards are high,"" Monroe said. ""We don’t make exceptions."" If someone was already a bus driver and then pleaded guilty to a drug charge the employee would face discipline including the potential of being fired, Monroe said. ""What we perceive is you are taking drugs, which is a violation of our rules,"" she said. We also contacted spokespersons for a few other Florida school districts to ask if a cocaine possession conviction would make a school bus driver candidate ineligible. Miami-Dade County has a similar policy to Lee County. Broward likely wouldn’t hire such an individual, said spokeswoman Nadine Drew. Pasco schools’ guidelines call for a committee review but not automatic denial of employment for drug convictions. However, a recent cocaine possession conviction would likely disqualify someone, spokeswoman Linda Cobbe said. School bus drivers must have a commercial driver's license. A cocaine possession plea ""in and of itself would not necessarily prevent a person from obtaining a CDL or result in a revocation of a CDL,"" John Lucas, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles told PolitiFact in an email. ""That decision would have to come from the courts. However, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles could take action if the person was found to be in possession of cocaine while operating a commercial vehicle."" Our ruling In a Facebook post vowing to advocate for Radel’s replacement, Scott said, ""The sad reality is that Trey Radel does not even qualify to drive a Lee County school bus at this point, yet he occupies a seat in Congress."" Radel was convicted of misdemeanor cocaine possession in Washington. If he had been charged in Florida he would have faced a felony. Under the unlikely scenario that Radel’s future career plans include applying for a job as a Lee County school bus driver, the district’s policies state that it won’t hire anyone currently on probation or who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor drug charge within the past five years, or a felony drug charge in the past decade. Radel’s future as a congressman may be in the hands of the voters of Southwest Florida. But Scott is correct that Radel’s drug conviction has put the brakes on him becoming a bus driver. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EA9F8CC0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/15/mike-scott/sheriff-says-trey-radels-cocaine-conviction-means-/

Just 3% of younger voters don't believe climate change is happening, Sen. Chris Murphy says
","More than a dozen Senate Democrats called a news conference on Jan. 14, 2014, to draw attention to their efforts to curb climate change. One of those senators -- Chris Murphy, D-Conn. -- focused his remarks on the impact of public opinion on advancing an agenda on climate-change policy. Murphy said that advocates for policies to address climate-change ""have to convince Republicans -- and those who would stand against the action that we're proposing -- of the electoral consequences of continuing to ignore this issue. We have to tell Republicans that if they ultimately want to stop the hemorrhaging from young voters in this country, they need to start paying attention to this issue, because only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening."" We wondered whether Murphy’s polling data was sound. Thanks to some previous reporting by our colleagues at PolitiFact Rhode Island, we quickly found a poll that appears to be the source for Murphy’s claim. It was commissioned by the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group, and conducted by a polling team that included one Democratic firm and one Republican firm. The poll was taken between July 8 and July 10, 2013, with 600 respondents, all of whom were registered voters between 18 and 34 who voted in the 2012 general election. The poll asked, ""Which of the following best describes your view of climate change?"" Here are the responses: • Climate change is a severe threat that we must start addressing now: 55 percent • Climate change is an issue to address in the years ahead, but it's not urgent now: 11 percent • Climate change may be happening, but it's a natural event that humans can't affect: 27 percent • Climate change is not really happening: 3 percent • Don't know: 3 percent This appears to support Murphy’s claim. We should note a few quibbles. • The poll was paid for by an environmental group. We always believe it’s worth noting whenever someone cites a poll paid for by a group with a perspective and a stake in the issue. However, the fact that two polling firms, one from each party, were included makes the poll somewhat more credible. • On a subsequent question in the same poll -- ""When, if ever, will the consequences of climate change personally affect people like you?"" -- the number answering ""never"" was 6 percent. That’s higher than 3 percent, though both are small percentages in the larger scheme of things. • There’s one other poll that asks a similar question and finds different results. But they aren’t exactly comparable. The Pew Research Center -- an independent polling organization -- surveyed a national sample of 1,504 adults age 18 or older between Oct. 9 and Oct. 13, 2013. One of the questions Pew asked was: ""From what you’ve read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?"" Among 18- to 29-year-olds, 73 percent said the earth is warming, and 18 percent said it was not warming -- quite a bit higher than the 3 percent from the other poll. The two polls use different age ranges, but if respondents up to age 34 were added in, that would likely increase the percentage of global-warming deniers further, since an even higher percentage of 30- to 49-year olds said there was no global warming -- 28 percent. Why such divergent responses? One factor could be the precise wording of each poll. But a bigger difference is likely the pool of respondents. The LCV poll only counted answers from ""registered voters … who voted in the 2012 general election,"" while the Pew poll simply asked ""adults."" This means the poll results aren’t comparable in an apples-to-apples fashion. This difference might have posed a problem for Murphy, but he was careful with how he worded his claim. He said ""3 percent of voters"" -- not ""3 percent of Americans."" So we don’t find fault on these grounds. ""Pollsters don’t ask about climate change very often,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""Most polls show that most people believe global warming is real. The question for policy makers is what kind of priority it should be, and here, many pollsters show it not to be very high."" Our ruling Murphy said, ""Only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening."" It should be noted that Murphy cited a poll that had been paid for by an environmental group. Still, we couldn’t find any poll with genuinely comparable data that clashed with Murphy’s carefully worded assertion.

Scott Turner, House speaker hopeful, didn't lead college team in tackles, interceptions
","A first-term Texas legislator recently revisited his youthful determination to become a professional football player. State Rep. Scott Turner, R-Frisco, speaking Jan. 8, 2014, at a Texas Public Policy Foundation conference in Austin, said he made it to the NFL despite being sidelined through his first three seasons as a student-athlete at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Turner, lately an aspirant for speaker of the Texas House, said he thrived as a player only after agreeing to switch from offensive positions to defensive back. Referring to his senior season, Turner said: ""I started the whole year, led the team in interceptions and tackles from defensive back."" That’s quite an accomplishment in that many defenders can pile up tackles and interceptions. We were curious. The online 2013 Illinois Football Record Book from the university does not show Turner leading the Fighting Illini in tackles or interceptions in any seasons. At our request, Derek Neal, a University of Illinois spokesman, checked the football program’s ""archive book"" for the 1994 season. By phone, Neal confirmed that Turner started each of that season’s games at cornerback but said other players led the team in tackles and interceptions. Turner had 48 tackles, Neal said. Seven players had more: three linebackers, two safeties, a defensive end and defensive tackle. Dana Howard, a linebacker, led with 150 tackles, he said. Turner had two interceptions that season, Neal said, as did three other players. Another cornerback, Robert Crumpton, led the team with four interceptions, Neal said. After we obtained these figures, Turner told us he’d intended to indicate that he led players at his position--cornerback--in tackles and interceptions; he said by phone that he’d forgotten he trailed a fellow cornerback in interceptions. ""I know that defensive backs never lead the team in tackles. If you do, that’s a horrible team... If I misspoke, obviously, I apologize for that,"" Turner said. ""I don’t need to embellish the truth. I played."" Our ruling Turner said he started every game of his senior season, leading the team in tackles and interceptions from defensive back. Turner indeed started every game. But he finished eighth in tackles and tied for second in interceptions with several players. He also did not lead defensive backs in either category.

"['Oregon', 'Bill Post']","
Has Rep. Tina Kotek, D-Portland, ever held a job?
","The meteoric rise of social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook has not been lost on politicians. Rare is the officeholder or candidate who doesn’t take advantage of social media’s inexpensive platforms to reach targeted audiences. Still, rules and etiquette remain murky. Most users understand that using all-caps is like yelling, but finer points remain a work in progress. Conservative radio talk-show host Bill Post, a newly announced Republican candidate for the Oregon House, got into a spirited back-and-forth Jan. 9 on Twitter with Carla Axtman, an editor for Blue Oregon, a left-leaning political blog. When Post held himself out as a ""real citizen legislator,"" Axtman shot back that ""we need a professional legislature now. The citizen leg model is rinky dink."" Post asked Axtman to define ""professional."" Then, referring to the Democratic speaker of the House, he added: ""Tina Kotek? What profession is she? Never held a job nor run a business."" We wondered if that was true. Has Kotek never held a job or run a business? PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We emailed Kotek’s Salem office and received a reply from Jared Mason-Gere, her communications director. He provided details of Kotek’s work history, a couple of which are also listed on her official website. ""Most recently she has been a self-employed independent contractor working as a management consultant for nonprofit organizations,"" Mason-Gere wrote of Kotek, who was first elected to House District 44 representing parts of North and Northeast Portland in 2006. Before that, he said, she was policy director for Children First For Oregon after spending several years working for the Oregon Food Bank. ""Like the rest of us,"" Mason-Gere said, ""she also had a variety of jobs during and after college. While she was getting her Master’s degree, she worked as a graduate teaching assistant; she’s been a travel agent, office temp, and office administrator among other things."" When she was growing up in York, Pa., he added, she and her brother delivered the York Dispatch newspaper. Checks with both Children First for Oregon and the Oregon Food Bank confirmed that Kotek worked in the jobs indicated by Mason-Gere and her website. We called Post for a response. Asked first about his exchange with Axtman, he said, ""Twitter is Twitter. Twitter is yelling back and forth. I see Twitter as passing notes in high school. I don’t take it too serious."" Asked about Kotek, Post said, ""Define job for me. I don’t know her history. I just pulled that out of my hat."" At that point, Post excused himself, saying he needed to prepare for his afternoon radio show. We called him back afterward. He said the real point of his exchange with Axtman involved debating the merits of a citizen versus professional legislature. ""What Carla wants is a full-time paid legislature,"" Post said. ""I was goading her to say that out loud. I just threw a name out. It could have been (Oregon Senate President) Peter Courtney. It could have been anyone."" Informed of Kotek’s work history, he added, ""Is lobbying a job? I suppose it is. You get paid for it. I guess I’m wrong. That’s a job."" We circled back to Post’s initial dismissal of Twitter as akin to ""passing notes in high school,"" noting that his own Twitter account has been used to highlight guests on his upcoming radio shows and his various campaign events. He agreed that the medium has valuable uses, adding that he has an intern who posts on his account ""all day."" He acknowledged that he was the one in the back-and-forth with Axtman, though. The second part of Post’s claim, that Kotek has ""never run a business,"" is largely correct. Kotek has worked as a self-employed consultant, advising nonprofits on business operations, but she didn’t have business cards, a website or a state filing. Neither has she ever claimed to have run a business, Mason-Gere said. Post took to Twitter to argue with a blogger about the nature of the Oregon Legislature -- citizen or professional? In doing so, he claimed that Kotek had ""never held a job nor run a business."" Granted, use of social media such as Twitter and Facebook continues to evolve, but Post’s claim about Kotek’s job history is just plain wrong. She has, in fact held a number of jobs, including ranking administrative positions. Kotek hasn’t ""run a business"" in the traditional sense but has worked as a self-employed consultant. Post did later admit he was wrong on his assertion. But he also acknowledged that he made his claim about Kotek with zero research or knowledge -- noting, even, that ""It could have been anyone"" and ""I just pulled that out of my hat."" That shows an extreme disregard for the truth. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBCA6E40>],/factchecks/2014/jan/15/bill-post/has-rep-tina-kotek-d-portland-ever-held-job/

Carly Fiorina: 70% of world's poor are women
","Editors note: After this fact-check published, we looked deeper into the stat Fiorina cited. You can read that work here. It is a powerful statistic that speaks to a fundamental injustice in this world. It emerged nearly two decades ago and has been used as a call to action ever since. Over the weekend, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina repeated it on ABC’s This Week. ""Seventy percent of the people living in abject poverty are women,"" Fiorina said. But so far as anyone can tell, that statement has no basis in fact. We reached out to Fiorina’s office and asked for the supporting data. We did not hear back. We went to the World Bank data pages and contacted the bank’s research staff. We exchanged emails with the United Nations Development Programme, and UN Women, an entity focused on gender equality. None of them could point to statistics that would confirm this claim. ""I checked with our research colleagues, and we can indeed not verify this figure either,"" said Nanette Braun, chief of communications and advocacy at UN Women headquarters. It’s a telling admission, given that UN Women references the statistic on its own Web page.  Duncan Green, who spent eight years as director of research for Oxfam-Great Britain, the international poverty relief organization, flagged a problem with the statistic three years ago in a blog post on Oxfam’s website. Green is now Oxfam’s special strategic adviser. ""Every expert (feminist economists, poverty researchers etc.) I’ve consulted on this agrees the number is dodgy,"" Green wrote. ""Yet people just keep on using it, presumably because its message is one they want to promote."" The original statistic dates to at least 1995, when it was mentioned in the United Nations Human Development Report. The report warned about rising disparities. ""The most persistent of these has been gender disparity, despite a relentless struggle to equalize opportunities between women and men. The unfinished agenda for change is still considerable. Women still constitute 70 percent of the world's poor and two thirds of the world's illiterates."" The 70 percent figure shows up a couple of times in the 205-page report but not in any of the report’s statistical tables. In fact, staff at the United Nations Development Programme said they no longer use it. Experts told us they’re not sure what the real figure is, but that it’s likely lower than 70 percent. ""Its not easy to say how many women are poor because data on poverty are typically constructed on a household basis,"" said Diane Elson, professor of sociology at the University of Essex. In other words, surveys don’t count how many women and men live in each household. Statisticians, some within the United Nations itself, began debunking the 70 percent figure as early as 1998 -- just three years after it gained prominence. Sylvia Chant, professor of development geography at the London School of Economics, pointed us to 2002 data from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. In Latin American countries, by a slight margin, women were more likely to live in poverty in rural areas. But the reverse was sometimes true in cities. ""In 10 out of 17 countries, the proportion of men in poverty is actually on a par with or slightly higher than women,"" Chant wrote in 2008. ""Women are nowhere near the level of 70 percent of people in income poverty as popularly expounded."" A 2001 analysis of 10 developing countries largely found no statistically significant differences. Where there was a gap, in every country but one, it was very narrow, and sometimes, as in the Latin America survey, men outnumbered women in poverty. Chant said Fiorina’s claim is no more right today than when it first emerged. Green, the Oxfam adviser, agreed. ""It was wrong then, and remains wrong,"" Green said. One note: While we don’t have a worldwide figure, we can use Census Bureau data to come up one for the United States. According to the most recent data, females account for 55 percent of Americans living in poverty. Our ruling Fiorina said that women account for 70 percent of the people in the world who live in poverty. She provided no support for the claim, nor does any seem to exist. We contacted the international bodies that rely on such statistics, and they told us they do not have the data to back up the claim. Independent experts echoed that point. At least in Latin America and the United States, the data suggest a much lower figure. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA56EC0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/15/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-70-worlds-poor-are-women/

Time's Rana Foroohar says median male worker hasn't seen a raise in 30 years
","For all the advances since the era of teased-out rocker hair, one thing hasn’t changed for America’s average working man: the amount of bacon he brings home. So says Rana Foroohar, a CNN global economic analyst and Time magazine assistant managing editor (who, by the way, snagged the first interview with new Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen). Appearing on CNN’s The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, Foroohar brought up the point during a general discussion about the country’s economic woes. ""You know, I have to jump in on this because we are living in a time when the corporate share of the overall economic pie is as high as it has been in decades,"" Foroohar said. ""Meanwhile, the median male worker in this country has not seen a raise, inflation-adjusted, for 30 years, basically."" Foroohar’s eye-popping statistic about median male worker income is certainly interesting. We wanted to know if it is correct. Comparing 1982-2012 The U.S. Census Bureau proved a go-to source. The bureau’s September report on income, poverty and health insurance coverage in 2012 contains text and tables outlining historical changes (or lack thereof) in earnings for both men and women. Foroohar referenced median earnings, which experts say is a better measure than the average because the income difference between the country’s rich and working-class earners is stark. In 2012, the latest year for which data is available, the median full-time, year-round male worker earned $49,398. In 1982, exactly 30 years earlier, earnings in 2012 dollars were $48,152. So from 1982 to 2012, there was actually an inflation-adjusted raise of $1,246. But that’s more because Foroohar is looking at two years in isolation. Tracking the income of median male workers over time shows that incomes climbed steeply from 1960 to 1970. But the figure has ebbed and flowed and remained mostly stagnant since 1970, dipping as low as $46,841 in 1996 and reaching a high of $51,670 in 1973. (You can view the table on page 50 of the report.) Point being: You could just as easily widen or shrink Foroohar’s 30-year window by a few years and find a number that supports her point. Median earnings of the 2012 male worker are down compared to his counterpart 25 years ago (who earned $50,166 in 1987), 35 years ago ($50,480 in 1977) or 40 years ago ($50,074 in 1970). Even though Foroohar’s window shows a 2.6 percent pay increase between 1982 and 2012, it’s really ""pretty close to flat,"" said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. ""It means that male median earnings increases just 0.085 percent per year (that is, 85 one-thousandths of a percentage point per year),"" he said. Some say men are even worse off Foroohar’s larger point, while technically correct and oft-repeated, misses the larger economic picture and is actually too generous, argues Michael Greenstone, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Greenstone co-authored a 2012 New York Times post with Brookings fellow Adam Looney that presented another way to examine median male wages. Instead of counting only the earnings of men with jobs, as the Census Bureau does, Greenstone factored in all working-age men. Factoring in men without jobs brings down the median income. The fraction of men in the workforce has declined sharply over the last several decades, he wrote, from 94 percent of prime-age men working in 1970 to 81 percent in 2010. It happened as incarceration rates and enrollment in the Social Security disability insurance program increased and labor force participation waned, as well as the ""wild success"" of women entering the labor market, he said. His 2012 study found real earnings of median males actually dropped by 19 percent since 1970, he found. ""This means that the median man in 2010 earned as much as the median man did in 1964 — nearly a half century ago."" The reasons for the trend are complex, Greenstone told us. Yes, there have been sweeping changes in technology, machinery and trade over the last 30 or 40 years that have had some effect. More striking, he said, is that educational attainment among men, which used to climb with each generation, has dropped off. ""The decline in working is concentrated among the men who have lower levels of education,"" Greenstone said. ""It’s not concentrated among the college-grad guy who is married to a super successful woman."" Michael Saltsman of the conservative Employment Policies Institute also argued the idea of ""stagnant"" wages is more controversial than it seems -- to a different end. He cited a 2012 study in the National Tax Journal that analyzed middle-class income from the past three cycles. Instead of using pre-tax income data, the researchers expanded the income definition to include taxes, income transfers and fringe benefits. ""Middle-class Americans are found to have made substantial gains, and these increases are even larger when including non-cash income, such as the ex-ante value of health insurance,"" the report says. Meanwhile, the earnings of female workers isn’t cited as often as a metric of the economy because their participation in the workforce jumped sharply over the last 50 years. In any case, the 2012 full-time, year-round median female worker earned $37,791, according to census figures. In 1982, when about half as many women were working, median earnings were $29,731. Our ruling Foroohar said, ""the median male worker in this country has not seen a raise, inflation-adjusted, for 30 years, basically."" Federal data for 1982-2012 shows a slight increase, though the numbers show the real value of median male earnings have been in the range of $46,840-$51,670 for about 40 years. We found another point of view that says the real median income has declined significantly once men without jobs are factored in. We also found a broader definition of income that changes the dynamic. Still, Foroohar clearly has a point. We rate her claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7A4300>],/factchecks/2014/jan/15/rana-foroohar/times-rana-foroohar-says-median-male-worker-hasnt-/

N.H. state Rep. Marilinda Garcia says she's ""cut spending"" as a legislator
","The cornerstone for any Republican seeking to be the next U.S. Representative for New Hampshire’s Second Congressional District is to come across as an authentic, fiscal conservative. And soon after Salem Republican state Rep. Marilinda Garcia announced that she would enter the Second District race, she touted her cost-cutting chops. ""I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature and will take that much-needed experience to Washington,"" Garcia, 30, declared in one of her first post-announcement statements on her Twitter account. The Telegraph and PolitiFact New Hampshire sought to determine the accuracy of that statement. State budget votes Garcia was first elected to the New Hampshire House in 2006 and was a backbencher when Democrats took control of the 400-member body for the first time in nearly a century. Garcia lost her reelection bid in 2008, but quickly won her seat back in a 2009 special election. Initially, Garcia served on the House Children and Family Law Committee, the panel that oversees divorce, adoption and custody but has essentially no direct impact on state spending matters. Claiming to cut spending is a pretty broad statement, but we’ll start with the major vote New Hampshire legislators take to increase or cut spending -- consideration of the state’s biennial budget. When Garcia was sworn in on Jan. 3, 2007, the state budget set by her fellow Republicans was $9.3 billion. The subsequent $9.7 billion budget, called for a 4 percent increase for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 was written primarily by Democrats. Garcia voted against it. The next $11.5 billion budget, also written by Democrats, called for a hefty 19 percent increase in spending for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. Garcia also voted against that. And the next state budget, crafted by conservative Republicans, including Garcia, after the GOP took over the chamber, cut back spending by more than a billion dollars to $10.3 billion. That budget plan was the first reduction in absolute dollars since World War II. Garcia voted in favor of that budget. Finally, the most recent $11 billion budget, covering fiscal years 2013 and 2014 and written by a Democratic majority, restored some of the cuts made in the previous budget. Garcia again voted no, though she said he didn’t mind restoring cuts to higher education, public safety and programs for troubled children. ""I thought with existing recovery of revenues we could add back some of those items,"" Garcia said in response to our inquiry about her record of cutting spending. Instead, she said she voted against it because of the removal of the Certificate of Need program that approves all construction projects for hospitals. ""I wanted to see those health care reforms in place, but they got taken out, so that's why I voted against it,"" Garcia said. Still, her budget votes while in the House are fairly consistent: She’s voted against every budget that called for an increase in spending and supported the one that cut spending. Other spending Reviewing Garcia’s entire, seven-year voting record and the bills she sponsored, Garcia consistently supported policies that would cut spending and taxes. In 2011, she voted to cut the taxes on hotel room rentals and meals and tobacco. She endorsed making it easier for local governments to adopt spending caps and supported banning higher-education spending on New Hampshire Public Television. Last year she opposed raising state taxes on gasoline and tobacco. In addition, in 2011, Garcia voted for a bill to require agencies propose every two years how they would live with 10 percent cut in state spending. And in 2012, Garcia voted in favor of business tax breaks totaling more than $10 million a year. She did vote in favor of one bill that could have increased spending at the local level. She voted for House Bill 1305 in 2012 that would have reinstated an exemption from property taxes for telephone and communication company poles and conduits. Critics said this could have led to raising local property taxes $5 million to $6 million statewide to make up the difference. The GOP-led House killed the bill 166-133, with Garcia on the losing end. Does she deserve credit for cutting spending? When politicians claim credit for something that happens on their watch, we consider whether that credit is justified before we give the statement a Truth-O-Meter rating. In Garcia’s case, she is a legislator, not an executive, so she can’t unilaterally cut spending. And much of the time, she has been in the minority. However, during the one session in which she served in the majority, she can make a plausible claim for deserving credit for lower spending. In April 2011, then-House Speaker William O'Brien, a Republican, appointed Garcia to the House Finance Committee. She served on the committee when the state faced an $800 million budgetary hole caused by overly optimistic revenue projections. ""We solved it not by raising taxes but by cutting in a responsible way,"" Garcia said. At least one fellow Republican agrees. Former House Chief of Staff Gregory Moore said that ""when it comes to budgets, there are three kinds of legislators: Those who believe in smaller government, those who believe in more government and those who are pragmatic on the question from issue to issue. From the outset, Marilinda Garcia came from the first camp."" Our ruling Garcia said, ""I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature."" Her voting record on the state budget -- which comprises any legislator’s biggest impact on state spending -- show that Garcia voted against every budget that increased spending and voted in favor of the O’Brien budget that cut state spending for the first time since World War II. We found two minor asterisks. Even though she voted against the most recent state budget, she didn’t oppose it because it increased spending -- she opposed it because of how it treated a program that governs hospital construction and expansion. And she supported a bill on telephone and communication company poles and conduits that would have had the effect of raising taxes. Still, there are few, if any, votes she’s taken that would have increased spending or increased the size of government.  On balance, we rate her statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEB0E00>],/factchecks/2014/jan/14/marilinda-garcia/nh-state-rep-marilinda-garcia-says-shes-cut-spendi/

Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Fla., says 97 percent of those with jobs escape poverty
","Five decades after President Lyndon B. Johnson launched the War on Poverty, Fox News Sunday invited Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Fla., among others, to discuss the anniversary. Host John Roberts asked Southerland about ending current programs and moving to a system of block grants: ""You said, looking back on Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, it has failed and failed miserably. Do you keep putting more money into existing programs or do you -- as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) suggested earlier this week -- fundamentally reform everything, (taking) a big pot of money that the federal government has and (giving) that to the states to administer in innovative ways?"" Southerland responded, ""I think you have to look at the indicators -- the fundamentals of these programs. Look what causes poverty. We know that two-parent families (are) a child's greatest opportunity to avoid poverty. We know that a good quality education with daily parent involvement … reduces poverty. … If you have a job in this country, (there’s a) 97 percent chance that you're not going to be in poverty. And so, therefore, I think there's a better way."" Several readers asked us to check Southerland’s claim that if you have a job, there’s a ""97 percent chance"" that you're not going to be in poverty. We found Census Bureau data from 2012 that supports his claim. The Census Bureau found that 2.9 percent of Americans between 18 and 64 who worked full-time, year-round in 2012 were in poverty. However, we’ll note a caveat. Southerland said ""if you have a job"" -- and there are people in the United States who have jobs, but not full-time, full-year jobs. Among Americans age 18 to 64 who have part-time jobs, the poverty rate is 16.6 percent. And among all workers -- Americans who have either a full- or a part-time job -- the rate is 7.3 percent. So a more accurate number for the likelihood of poverty ""if you have a job"" is 92.7 percent, or, rounding up, 93 percent. That’s very close to 97 percent, but slightly off. ""While the percentages may vary slightly from one year to the next, independent sources make clear that your chances of living in poverty increase more than ten-fold if you don’t have a steady, full-time job,"" said Matt McCullough, a spokesman for Southerland. A final point: The census figures show that nearly 2.9 million people worked full time for the whole year yet still ended up below the poverty line. That may only be 2.9 percent of all full-time workers, but it’s still a whole lot of people working, yet still ending up below the poverty line. Our ruling Southerland said, ""If you have a job in this country, (there's a) 97 percent chance that you're not going to be in poverty."" That’s true only for full-time jobs. If you include both full-time jobs and part-time jobs, then the percentage drops slightly, to 93 percent. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF4A7C0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/14/steve-southerland/rep-steve-southerland-r-fla-says-97-percent-those-/

Vinehout says $1.60 tax cut didn't show in weekly paychecks
","Despite lower income-tax rates enacted by lawmakers, Wisconsin workers didn’t see the result in their paychecks in 2013 unless they took special action. Taxpayers will see the benefit when they file their tax returns this year and get either a larger refund or a smaller bill. Why? The state did not change the tax withholding tables to reflect the new, lower rates -- following a long tradition in Madison. The state currently has no plan to update the withholding tables in 2014, either. That’s the sum of what we learned as we checked out a claim by state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout, D-Alma, about what the average worker would save from the tax cut approved in 2013 by Republican lawmakers and Gov. Scott Walker. Vinehout, who is mulling a run for governor this fall, opposed the tax cut, as did many Democrats. She says the savings for individual families wasn’t worth the $650 million in lost revenue to the state over two years. This is what she told a small audience in Waukesha on Dec. 5, 2013: ""Get rid of the tax decrease,"" Vinehout said. ""Did you know -- you might not know this -- if you make the average amount of people in Wisconsin, $50,000, you got $1.60 less a week in taxes? You might not have known that because they didn’t change the withholding tables, so it didn’t show up in your paycheck."" She added: ""But, if you file for your refund, and let’s say you file it a little late, and you get that refund sometime in June, you’ll maybe have a little more money, which might be just about the time the governor’s is out there on the campaign trail saying, hmm, you got more money in your pocket because of what I gave you."" Let’s examine the elements of Vinehout’s claim. Check’s in the mail Wisconsin Revenue Department spokesperson Laurel Patrick confirmed that withholding tables were not updated after the tax cut, and said no decision has been made to do so in 2014 either. The tax cut reduced rates in all five tax brackets. That means the tax-rate changes are not automatically reflected on people’s paychecks. To get the tax savings on their regular paycheck, employees must file a new WT-4 or WT-4A form with their employer. Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said the state, with a few exceptions, has long tried to help its immediate cash flow needs by not automatically making tax cuts show up on people’s paychecks. The practice predates Walker. The state is now over-withholding by 20 percent or more because it has typically not adjusted the tables, Berry said. Many taxpayers may prefer getting a lump sum at refund time, Berry said, but they should understand that as a group they essentially are giving state government a billion-dollar annual no-interest loan that adds to the state deficit under generally accepted accounting principles. ""Politicians know it’s more politically valuable for people to get a nice refund in 2014,"" Berry said. What’s the savings? The rest of Vinehout’s claim was that ""if you make the average amount of people in Wisconsin, $50,000, you got $1.60 less a week in taxes"" under the income tax cut. When we asked for evidence, Vinehout’s office pointed to a Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis of the tax savings from the income-tax changes, and to separate state figures on tax burdens. The average Wisconsin adjusted gross income, across all types of filers, was $47,310 for tax year 2010, according to a Revenue Department analysis. There is 2011 data, the latest available, that puts the figure at $48,537, according to Dale Knapp, research director at the Taxpayers Alliance. Vinehout looked up that average income in the June 2013 memo by the non-partisan Fiscal Bureau, which presents ranges of income along with tax changes estimated for 2014. The Fiscal Bureau is the independent budget scorekeeper in Madison, and its reports on taxes are used by both parties to gauge the impact of proposals. The bureau’s analysis said that in the $40,000 to $50,000 range, the average savings is $85 for one year. That works out to $1.63 a week, which Vinehout referred to as $1.60 in her claim. So, Vinehout puts the average income into the slot, and with a bit of rounding her figure for the average tax change is on target. There’s some imprecision built in here, though, because the Fiscal Bureau memo uses income ranges rather than one particular income. So while Vinehout mentions $50,000, she gets the $1.60 average tax change from an income range of $40,000 to $50,000. And because the average state income is above the midpoint of that range, it’s likely the average tax change would differ slightly from the $1.60. There are other ways to illustrate the impact of the tax cut. One is to look at the types of filers rather than just the composite income brackets as in the Fiscal Bureau memo. Depending on the example used, one approach yields a smaller tax change figure than Vinehout’s approach, the other a larger one. The average single person who filed taxes had $26,556 in income, while married couples had an average of $83,480, said Knapp. Walker, for his part, chooses the married couple example. Such a couple with two children would save about $173 a year, or $3.33 per week over the two years. On the lower end, the average single would see a weekly savings of about 73 cents. The overall state average that Vinehout cites is a middle ground between those two numbers. Our rating Vinehout said that ""if you make the average amount of people in Wisconsin, $50,000, you got $1.60 less a week in taxes"" under the $650 million state income-tax cut, but ""it didn’t show up in your paycheck."" The average income she cites is slightly high but within reasonable rounding range. She uses a reliable source for her tax-change numbers, and they are on target or very close, with the caveat that the analysis is set up for income ranges rather than a precise income. She’s right that the tax cut did not just show up in workers’ paychecks, due to inaction by the state. With the clarifications noted, we rate her claim Mostly True.

Group claims Georgia jobs at risk if benefits not extended
","When lawmakers returned to Congress after the new year, Democrats and Republicans went back to their corners and began sparring over whether to extend unemployment benefits. Georgia’s two U.S. senators, Republicans Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson, both opposed a Democratic-led $6.4 billion proposal to extend the benefits, which expired Dec. 28. Americans United for Change, a liberal advocacy group, promptly sent out a press release decrying the senators’ votes. The group included a claim about the economic impact to Georgia about extending those benefits that put PolitiFact Georgia and its Truth-O-Meter to work. ""Sens. Isakson’s, Chambliss’ Votes Against Unemployment Insurance Were Votes to Kill Nearly 6,000 Georgia Jobs,"" Americans United for Change wrote in the headline. Is that true, we wondered? Georgians now are eligible for a maximum of 18 weeks of state-based unemployment insurance, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Congress typically enacts extended federal benefits during recessions, and the expired benefits ran for a maximum of 47 additional weeks. Chambliss and Isakson have supported a GOP proposal to pay for a $6.4 billion long-term unemployment insurance extension and to restore $6 billion in cost-of-living increases for early military pensions. They would pay for that by preventing illegal immigrants from claiming a tax credit for their children. Americans United for Change based its claim on a report on the White House website pushing the extension. Called ""The Economic Benefits of Extending Unemployment Benefits,"" the report outlines how many jobs would be saved in 2014 by continuing the insurance. In Georgia, the total was 5,876. Nationally, the impact is 240,000 jobs, the report says. The report was written by the U.S. Labor Department and the Council of Economic Advisors. Without the additional unemployment insurance, many of those jobless workers would seek help from other federal programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as the food stamp program. White House officials pointed to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to support the claim. The CBO released a report in December that concluded extending unemployment benefits through the end of 2014 would add about 200,000 jobs nationwide. That estimate is slightly lower but pretty close to the report on the White House website. The CBO and White House reports use the amount of money spent in each state from unemployment insurance and estimate how many jobs it will create or save. Unemployment benefits have a trickle-down effect on the economy, some say. The money those unemployed recipients receive in benefits is used to buy groceries and other services that keep others employed or can create additional jobs. ""Who provides goods and services? Workers,"" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist for the Economic Policy Institute, a generally left-leaning, Washington-based nonprofit that supports extending the benefits. The institute has done its own research on the topic. It concluded 310,000 jobs would be created. Shierholz, who co-wrote the report, said her group used federal data and added a multiplier to come up with its estimate. Shierholz said the Obama administration report used what she described as ""standard"" methodology to come up with its estimate. ""Their overall numbers make sense,"" Shierholz told us. University of Georgia professor Jeffrey Dorfman was not so convinced about the effectiveness of extending the benefits. He said if you believe that deficit spending will boost the economy, ""then the methodology used is correct and reasonably well done."" ""I personally think these models far overstate the benefits of deficit spending because they do not account for the cost of the lost spending by whoever would have borrowed the money if the government hadn't borrowed it first,"" Dorfman said via email. ""We see the benefits of the government spending but do not see the jobs that would have been created in the private sector instead."" He also questioned the logic of extending the benefits. ""Extended unemployment payments are currently scored at $6.5 billion for a 3 month extension. If we figure $26 billion for the whole year versus the 240,000 jobs that the White House says will be ‘saved or created’ by that spending, that works out to $108,333 per job,"" Dorfman said. ""Clearly, we would be better off if the federal government just randomly picked 240,000 long term unemployed people and gave them government jobs at say $40,000 per year."" To sum up, Americans United for Change claimed extending unemployment benefits would save nearly 6,000 Georgia jobs this year. The claim was based on a federal report. Other nationwide estimates suggest the jobs number in the report is on target. But it is still an estimate that’s based on economic projections. And the overreaching point by American United for Change neglects the fact that Isakson and Chambliss back a GOP plan that would also extend jobless benefits. With those caveats, we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEAC740>],/factchecks/2014/jan/14/americans-united-change/group-claims-georgia-jobs-risk-if-benefits-not-ext/

Facebook post says 'Constitution exemption zones' extend 100 miles from U.S. borders
","In 2014, you’d be hard-pressed to find someone travelling without a laptop or smartphone, whether it’s professionals toiling over PowerPoint graphs on planes or teenagers scrolling through Instagram in the backseats of cars. So when a reader asked PolitiFact to vet a Facebook post about travelling across U.S. borders with electronics, we were intrigued. ""If you live within 100 miles of the United States border, then you're in what is being called, the 'Constitution exemption zone,’ "" read the post on a page called World Must Wake Up. ""U.S. District Judge Edward Korman ruled that authorities along the U.S border could seize and search laptops, smartphones and other electronic devices without a warrant (direct violation of the Fourth Amendment)."" PolitiFact wanted to dig deeper into the notion of a Constitution exemption zone. The page’s creator didn’t respond to our request for comment. The Facebook post referenced a case in the Eastern District of New York, Abidor vs. Napolitano. U.S.-French dual citizen Pascal Abidor had his laptop searched and confiscated crossing into the United States from Canada. His laptop was returned 11 days later, when he found evidence that his personal files were searched. On Dec. 31, a federal judge dismissed the case, which followed a trend of previous cases regarding electronic privacy at U.S. borders. We learned that the loose rules for border searchers the post mentioned didn’t start here, or in the digital age at all. The history of border searches Loose search regulations at the border are old news. Really old news. In 1789, the First Congress passed an exception for border searches that authorized federal officials to search people crossing the border without a warrant issued after proof of probable cause. A couple of years later, the Fourth Amendment became law. That protects citizens from most searches except when a warrant is obtained by proving probable cause. Today, the exception for searches near borders is a part of the Immigration and Nationality Act. It’s not considered an exception to the Fourth Amendment as a whole, just to the warrant requirement. At an international border or the functional equivalent of one (for example, an inland international airport), officials can search a person and his or her possessions without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. There’s a similar procedure called an extended border search, where almost all the same rules apply. Within 100 miles of an international border, officials can search a person and his or her possessions, but here they have to prove reasonable suspicion, a lower threshold than probable cause. Now, there’s a reason border officials have historically had more wiggle room to enforce their authority than other federal officials. The government wants to ensure that contraband, like illicit drugs, don’t enter the country. There are consequences for officers who abuse these privileges. ""There’s some pretty stiff administration that is taken against the officer and the agency,"" said Victor Manjarrez, a border security and immigration professor at University of Texas at El Paso. ""That’s a potential civil rights violation. It’s not taken lightly at all."" Constitution-exempt? The American Civil Liberties Union first coined the term ""Constitution-free zones."" Historically, the ACLU created the term Constitution-free zones in reference to stops near the border for reasons other than criminal activity, like random inquiries on highways about immigration status. They don’t use that term in relation to inland electronics searches. ACLU staff attorney Catherine Crump said the Facebook post on electronic privacy takes their argument (now many years old) out of context. They’ve filed two lawsuits regarding electronic searches at borders, including Abidor vs. Napolitano. ""We don’t know of any instances in which the government has taken advantage of this suspicionless electronic device search policy to search people who aren’t at the functional equivalent of the border,"" Crump said. How technology fits in While the border search exception isn’t new, it’s safe to say technology has evolved over the last few centuries, and that’s what makes the more recent cases distinctive. Before travelers carried phones and laptops, a search of someone’s belongings could only go so far. But technology gives border officials information that reaches far beyond what a person has physical access to. ""The notion of these electronic searches is, in and of itself, quite dramatic,"" said Fred Cate, an Indiana University cybersecurity professor. ""Now, if you can search the laptop or the cell phone, you’re probably getting access to all of their emails, all of their business records."" Officials can seize electronics and hold them for several days under the law. Of course, individuals and businesses can take precautions to limit or entirely prevent border officials from accessing private data. Manjarrez predicted that the issue would eventually end up in the Supreme Court, but for now electronic searches are here to stay. Our ruling A Facebook post said a judge's order means there's a ""Constitution exemption zone"" if you live ""within 100 miles of the United States border."" There is a border search exception, which long predates the district court ruling, that allows officials at or near borders to search people and their possessions without obtaining warrants. Experts say that’s not an exception to the whole Fourth Amendment. It's certainly not an exemption to the entire Constitution, which covers a wide range of rights, like freedom of the press and freedom of religion. The post has an element of truth but takes information out of context and requires a good deal of clarification. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCA4A40>],/factchecks/2014/jan/13/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-constitution-exemption-zones-ex/

Barack Obama Facebook post says unemployment benefits saved 620,000 kids from poverty
","In the midst of a battle over whether to extend unemployment insurance for the long-term unemployed, President Barack Obama’s Facebook page posted this: ""Unemployment insurance kept more than 620,000 children out of poverty in 2012. Tell Congress to renew job seekers' economic lifeline."" We wondered whether this claim, which was posted Jan. 7, 2014, was accurate. We checked with Organizing for Action, the pro-Obama group that the president has deputized to handle his personal Twitter and Facebook accounts. Organizing for Action spokeswoman Katie Hogan said the numbers were based on a report by the Joint Economic Committee, a panel in Congress that consists of both House members and Senators. While the Joint Economic Committee is bipartisan as well as bicameral, the report was written by the panel’s Democratic staff, which is overseen by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. In its summary table, the Joint Economic Committee report says that, nationally, 2,458,295 Americans were lifted out of poverty due to unemployment insurance payments, including 618,788 children. According to the table, the calculations were based on U.S. Census Bureau data. Specifically, the committee used publicly available data files that had information on 387,876 individuals, with the identifying information removed. If the difference between a person’s income and the poverty line was less than the amount of unemployment insurance they had received, they were counted as having been lifted out of poverty due to unemployment insurance. This number was used as the basis for estimating the number nationally. So, unless the Joint Economic Committee staff muffed the calculations, the Obama Facebook post was in the ballpark, though the figure was actually slightly less than 620,000, instead of ""more than 620,000,"" as the Facebook post said. That said, it’s worth taking a closer look at the numbers -- specifically the threshold for what counted as being in poverty. The table notes that the committee used the Supplemental Poverty Measure rather than the traditional way of measuring poverty. What’s the difference? Currently, poverty is officially measured by establishing a set of income thresholds for families of different sizes and compositions, then comparing family incomes to those levels. Being in poverty means that you have an income below the threshold for your family type. But for years, scholars have debated whether there is a better way to measure poverty than the official statistic. One of the efforts to test an alternative measurement is called the Supplemental Poverty Measure. The Supplemental Poverty Measure doesn’t just consider cash earned but also in-kind transfers such as food stamps, as well as taxes paid and medical and work-related expenses, such as child care and commuting costs, wrote University of Massachusetts-Amherst economist Nancy Folbre in a New York Times blog post. It also employs a ""new standard of need, linked to what low-income families actually spend,"" she wrote. In 2010, a federal interagency working group gave a green light to begin calculating the statistic, but only as long as the long-standing poverty calculation retained its official status. Because the two poverty rates are calculated differently, the findings about how extensive poverty is in the United States are almost guaranteed to be different, though the poverty rate may end up higher for some subgroups using the supplemental method even as it is lower for other subgroups. So how does the use of the supplemental figure shape the Joint Economic Committee’s findings? A footnote to the chart reports that while the supplemental measure found that nearly 2.5 million Americans were lifted out of poverty by unemployment benefits, the number would have been 1.7 million using the official poverty calculation. The report doesn’t say how many children would have been lifted out of poverty using the traditional poverty calculation, but since the supplemental measure has sometimes shown lower poverty rates among children, it’s certainly plausible that the number also would be smaller than 618,788. If the proportion for children was the same as it was for individuals as a whole, the number of children lifted out of poverty would be 427,914. Our ruling Obama’s Facebook post said that ""unemployment insurance kept more than 620,000 children out of poverty in 2012."" The number has some backing from an analysis of Census Bureau data published by the Democratic staff of Congress’ Joint Economic Committee. However, this analysis used an unofficial poverty measure rather than the traditional one, and the report Obama’s team cites as support acknowledges that using the traditional poverty measure would have decreased the number of individuals lifted out of poverty by about one-third. A similar decrease among children would have meant the number of children would have been 427,914 rather than roughly 620,000. Overall, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA21CC0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/13/barack-obama/barack-obama-facebook-post-says-unemployment-benef/

Krauthammer: Obamacare has hidden insurance company bailout
","Bailout has never been a pretty word in politics or business and since the Great Recession, the stigma has only intensified. When Wall Street banks and automakers General Motors and Chrysler were awash in red ink, Washington threw them a $420 billion lifeline (of which $430 billion came back), while the Federal Reserve bought nearly $1.5 trillion worth of toxic mortgage-backed securities. Enter conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer with news of a new bailout. Krauthammer wrote in the Washington Post that ""buried deep"" in the Affordable Care Act is ""a huge government bailout"" to cover ""up to 80 percent of insurance company losses."" Krauthammer is talking about a couple of important pieces in the law that limit insurers’ losses in the first few years of the program. Without those protections, most insurance companies likely would have avoided the government marketplaces where people can pick a health plan. Krauthammer, who is no fan of Obamacare, supports legislation to remove those protections for health insurance providers from the law. ""Without viable insurance companies doing the work, it falls apart. No bailout, no Obamacare,"" he wrote. We wanted to look deeper into Krauthammer’s assertion that these measures are bailouts, akin to the support offered to banks and car makers. A bridge over risky waters The Affordable Care Act does a complete number on the insurance game as Americans know it, at least in the individual and small group markets. Instead of companies making a profit through selling policies to the healthy and avoiding the ill, the law aims to pull carriers into a world where they insure everyone and compete based on efficiency and value. We’re not saying that will necessarily happen, but that’s the goal. In sickness and health and everything in between, that’s the population the insurers must work with. The problem is, if you are an insurance company, how do you decide how much to charge in such a different landscape? Until you have a few years to see who is actually in the pool and how much health care they use, the uncertainty is way beyond your comfort zone. Enter the government and a few tricks to make the risk picture more manageable. The law forces insurers to share some profits and losses across health care plans. Money shifts from companies that paid out less than average in claims to companies that paid out more than average. It’s a permanent program meant to help level the playing field. The law also protects insurers from suffering losses for providing insurance to higher cost customers -- to a point. The program is called reinsurance, and here’s how it works. The law slaps a $63 fee or tax on most policies. That pool of money, which translates to $20 billion between 2014 and 2016, helps insurers pay for claims for people who require more medical attention. The reinsurance program lasts for only three years. A third part of the law, called a risk corridor, is another temporary program meant to mitigate an insurer’s risk. It’s the program that largely drives the concern over potential bailouts. The idea behind the corridor is that the government and insurers share risk for plans offered through the government marketplaces. Like the reinsurance program, it lasts only from 2014-16. Here’s how it works. The government sets financial benchmarks for each plan offered on the marketplace. As long as insurers come close to that benchmark, nothing happens. If an insurer overperforms by up to 3 percent, they can keep the extra revenue. If they underperform by up to 3 percent, they are forced to absorb those additional costs. When the gaps get wider, however, money starts changing hands. If insurers beat their benchmark by 3-8 percent, they have to split that extra revenue with the federal government. If insurers beat the mark by more than 8 percent, the government receives 80 percent of that additional money. On the flip side, when insurers fail to meet their benchmarks the government helps absorb those costs. If insurers underperform by 3-8 percent, the government will cover half the extra cost. The government covers 80 percent of the costs after that. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number cruncher of Congress, says all of these measures will be budget neutral. Some plans will share gains with the government and some will get checks from the government. Overall, the CBO predicts that the money going out will be matched by the money coming in. However, if the CBO is wrong, there is nothing to stop the money from flowing from the government to private insurers. There is no cap written into the law. The fear among conservatives is that ad hoc changes to the law since it passed could be creating a ripple effect where the marketplace insurance pools have more sick people and losses would rise. Hence, the concern over bailouts. The bailout dispute We asked Krauthammer why he called this a bailout and he said he relied on the definition from Merriam-Webster. ""The act of saving or rescuing something (such as a business) from money problems,"" he quoted. ""A rescue from financial distress."" Rescue is clearly the operative word. We looked at other definitions. The Palgrave Dictionary of Economics spoke of a rescue from ""potential or actual insolvency."" Investopedia had to prevent ""the consequences that arise from a business's downfall."" The country’s recession bailouts fit these definitions nicely. First the private firms were in crisis and then the government stepped in with taxpayer dollars. For Scott Harrington, professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, Krauthammer’s use of the word in the context of the Affordable Care Act gets the sequence wrong. ""Bailouts involve ex post actions to address private sector screw-ups,"" Harrington said. ""That's not what happened here."" Although the government could end up writing some large checks, the system was not explicitly set up to do that. Companies are expected to try to make a profit, and they have yet to experience any losses. Mark A. Hall, professor of law and public health at Wake Forest University, took exception to Krauthammer’s statement because Krauthammer writes as though all the money comes from American taxpayers. ""A bailout is using general taxpayer revenues to help an industry or interest group,"" Hall said. ""Here, the funding source is mainly from insurers themselves."" Mary van der Heijde, a principal and actuary with the health care consulting firm Milliman, told PunditFact that Krauthammer’s term ""strikes me as an aggressive characterization."" In her view, Krauthammer spoke only to the negative side of the program. ""This (risk corridor) provision is applied uniformly, in that both gains and losses are shared with the government,"" van der Heijde said. ""Not just losses."" Melinda Buntin, chair of the Department of Health Policy at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, noted that this is not the first time the government has used the risk corridor approach. It was part of the launch of the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. ""Under that, insurers have actually incurred higher profits than expected on average and have thus paid money back into the government,"" Buntin said. Our ruling Krauthammer said the Affordable Care Act contains a hidden government bailout for insurance companies that would cover up to 80 percent of their losses. The health care law does contain several mechanisms to mitigate potential losses for insurance companies, and the government stands to help absorb some losses up to 80 percent. But the government also stands to gain if insurance companies are able to turn profits, and the Congressional Budget Office has projected that the government would neither make nor lose money. Experts we spoke with also took issue with Krauthammer’s use of the term ""bailout."" In the past decade, bailouts came after private businesses faced a financial crisis. The measures in the Affordable Care Act have a more complicated sequence that include a variety of outcomes. This claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC976640>],/factchecks/2014/jan/13/charles-krauthammer/krauthammer-obamacare-has-hidden-insurance-company/

Marco Rubio says Medicaid expansion money 'will go away'
","The war on poverty would be more effective if states had more control over federal programs such as Head Start, says U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. In an interview with Rubio on CBS’ Face the Nation, host Bob Schieffer pointed out this approach resembles the optional Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Right-leaning leaders in several states rejected federal money to cover more residents through the federal-state program. ""What if these states opt out of these programs?"" Schieffer asked. Obamacare is different, Rubio replied. ""Well, here’s the distinguishing factor. Under Obamacare, when you turn Medicaid over to the states, what you're saying to them is, the money will be available up front for the expansion for a few years,"" he said. ""Then, the money will go away, but you get stuck with the unfunded liability. I’m not saying we should do that."" Is Rubio correct about the federal money for expanding Medicaid going away after a few years? Somewhat. The Affordable Care Act aimed to expand access to health insurance for the nation’s uninsured residents. The architects of the law envisioned an expansion of Medicaid in each state to cover low-income adults up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2013 was $15,856 for an individual or $26,951 for a family of three in 2013. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the law as constitutional, but justices struck down the mandatory Medicaid expansion. That left it to state leaders to decide whether to offer more residents coverage through the jointly administered program. Twenty-three states are not expanding Medicaid, including Texas and Florida, states with high uninsured populations, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. On the other side, 26 states including the District of Columbia are implementing the expansion in 2014, and two states will move ahead with an expansion after the first year. For conservative governors in Ohio, Michigan and Arizona, the deal offered by the federal government to expand was too good to pass up. The federal government will cover 100 percent of the cost of adding new adult Medicaid beneficiaries from 2014 to 2016. The federal government will scale down its payments to 95 percent in 2017, 94 percent in 2018, 93 percent in 2019, and 90 percent in 2020, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The 90 percent level is permanent. States will not have to shoulder more than 10 percent of the cost after that, unless Congress passed a law to change the ratio. Our ruling Rubio said, ""Under Obamacare, when you turn Medicaid over to the states, what you're saying to them is, the money will be available up front for the expansion for a few years. Then, the money will go away, but you get stuck with the unfunded liability."" His office did not respond to us. The federal government will only pay 100 percent of the costs of expanding Medicaid for three years starting in 2014. But Rubio leaves a misleading impression with viewers that all of the money just goes away. The federal government plans to bring down its share to a permanent funding level of 90 percent. Rubio's statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB0FFAC0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/13/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-medicaid-expansion-money-will-go-/
"['Education', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
McDonnell says charter schools have grown in Virginia
","Former Gov. Bob McDonnell was not shy about about claiming success during his final State of the Commonwealth Address. Among the accomplishments he cited in his hour-long speech: ""We expanded charter"" schools. Charter schools are alternative primary or secondary academies that receive tax dollars but are not subject to all of the regulations and laws that govern public schools. In exchange for the waivers, the institutions sign a charter guaranteeing certain results. While charter schools have become popular in many states, they’ve encountered stony resistance from local officials in Virginia. So we thought McDonnell’s claim of expansion during his administration -- which ended Saturday -- was worth a look. Taylor Keeney, a McDonnell spokeswoman, cited figures from the state Department of Education showing there were three charter schools in Virginia when McDonnell became governor in January 2010 and now there are six. The growth, when put in a national perspective, is microscopic. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, there were 5,274 charter schools across the country in 2010-11, the most recent figures available. The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported 6,004 charter schools for the 2012-13 school year. The states with the most charter schools were California with 1,065; Florida, 576; Arizona, 534; Ohio, 374; and Texas, 280. In the region, North Carolina had 107;  the District of Columbia, 57; and Maryland, 52. McDonnell has often blamed the resistance in Virginia on local school boards which, under state law, have the final say on whether a charter school is opened. In 2010, he backed legislation that would have allowed the state Board of Education -- which is appointed by the governor -- to override any locality’s rejection of a charter school.. The General Assembly passed a watered-down version of the bill that keeps the final decision in local hands. It provides a process by which a charter school whose application was denied could return to the local school board for reconsideration. In 2012, McDonnell backed successful legislation that established a state panel of experts to help prospective charter schools prepare applications to local school boards. It also mandated that approved charter schools receive per-student funding that is ""commensurate"" with other public schools in the locality. Officials from two national organizations advocating charter schools told us they were unimpressed with McDonnell’s record, saying three new academies over his four-year term does not represent a change of culture in Virginia. The Center for Education Reform rates Virginia’s laws second worst among the 43 states that have charter schools. Similarly, the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools ranks Virginia No. 39 out of 43 in its rankings of laws.  ""Virginia is the the rock-bottom tier of states,"" said Todd Ziebarth, senior vice president for state advocacy and support at the alliance. ""They may have opened the door, but they shouldn’t expect a stampede,"" Ziebarth said. ""One of the big takeaways under the McDonnell administration is a general disappointment in the charter school community because McDonnell seemed to support charter schools and made some tweaks every year, but at the end of the day, his administration didn’t result in very significant changes in the law."" Our ruling McDonnell, citing accomplishments during his term, said charter schools in Virginia ""expanded"" during his administration. The number rose from three to six -- barely a ripple in a nation of about 6,000 charter schools. The tiny increase underscores a larger truth unmentioned by McDonnell: He was unable to change state laws that are highly unfavorable to charter schools. Adding three new new charter schools does represent a expansion, however. McDonnell’s statement is accurate but omits the context: Virginia still has just a handful of charter schools. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB11F200>],/factchecks/2014/jan/13/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-charter-schools-have-grown-virginia/
"['Jobs', 'Labor', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker says minimum wage jobs are ‘overwhelmingly’ for young people
","Gov. Scott Walker opposes increasing the federal minimum wage, fearing it would prompt employers to do less hiring. In making his case, Walker paints a picture of low-wage workers as people working the counter at fast-food restaurants. ""I started out, just like Paul Ryan did down the road from me, working at McDonald's,"" Walker told Chuck Todd on MSNBC’s ""The Daily Rundown"" on Jan. 6, 2013. He added: ""Jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce. The last thing you want to do is have fewer young people (working) at a time when unemployment rates are still way too high for teenagers going into their 20s."" Walker’s characterization of the low-wage population touches on a critical element of the debate over raising the national wage, which stands at $7.25 an hour. Just who is making the minimum wage? Neither side can seem to agree on the makeup of those on the bottom end of the earning scale. Is Walker right that ""jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce""? His statement is in the context of calls for a higher national minimum wage, so we’ll focus primarily on the national view rather than on individual states, 21 of which have higher minimums than the federal standard. Nationally, 4.7 percent of hourly workers toil for $7.25 an hour or less (It can be less due to various exemptions in labor law, such as for employees who receive tips and others. Plus, many people making the minimum round it down to $7 when responding to the survey). That’s about 3.6 million people 16 or older, based on conservative estimates drawn from the monthly Current Population Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Labor market researchers frequently cite the survey. Of that total, 1.6 million report being right at the federal minimum wage -- 2.1% of the hourly workforce. The  BLS includes both groups -- those at the wage mark, and those below it -- in its statistical reports on minimum wage workers. Tips, commissions and overtime pay are not included in the pay data. Salaried workers are not part of the mix. Women, residents of the south, never-married workers, part-timers and service employees are more likely than their counterparts to work for $7.25 or less. Restaurant and other food service workers make up the biggest group. Teenagers overall are more likely than other age groups to work for the minimum, but even in that group nearly 80 percent of the teens earned more than $7.25. Here are the labor bureau’s findings on age: -- ""Minimum wage workers tend to be young,"" the labor bureau said in a February 2013 report that looked at numbers for 2012. ""Although workers under age 25 represented only about one-fifth of hourly paid workers, they made up about half of those paid the federal minimum wage or less."" --Teenagers (16 to 19) make up about one-quarter (24.1 percent) of hourly paid workers making $7.25 or less, or 31 percent of those right at the minimum wage. Age range of worker Breakdown of workers at minimum or less Breakdown of workers at exactly minimum wage 16 to 19 years old 24.1 percent 30.9 percent   20 to 24 26.5 24.1 25 to 34 20.3 15.5 35 to 44 10.9 9.8 45 to 54 10.4 10.5 55 to 64 5.4 6.4 65 to 69 1.4 1.6 70 and over 1.1 1.2   So how do the facts square with Walker’s comment that ""jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce."" He refers generally to ""young people"" and then later refines that to ""teenagers"" new to the workforce. So let’s look at both. Teenagers, as noted in the chart, make up 24 percent to 31 percent of the low-wage set, depending the measure. That group appears to best fit Walker’s description of ""people starting out in the workforce."" But some college-age youths are new to the workforce as well, and the labor bureau calls the 16 to 24 group ""young"" people in its analysis. That 16 to 24 set makes up more than half of hourly federal minimum wage workers -- 51 to 55 percent, again depending on whether you look at those exactly at the wage, or include those below it as well. Walker said the low-wage group is ""overwhelmingly"" young people, and mentioned teenagers. That strikes us as overstated given that workers older than 24 make up 45 percent to 49 percent of federal minimum wage workers. Teenagers are less than one-third of the overall low-wage group. But there’s no strict numerical definition of ""overwhelming"", so we asked two experts for their opinion. Mark Calabria, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us that Walker has a numerical point, though describes it incorrectly. ""Overwhelming"" implies more than a majority, he said. ""Disproportionately"" was a more apt description, given that such a large share of those low-wage jobs are held by young people who make up a small share of the hourly worker pool, said Calabria, a former senior staffer on the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson made the disproportionality argument to back up the governor’s statement. Among other numbers, he highlighted the fact that those 16-24 hold an estimated 55 percent share of jobs right at the federal minimum wage. David Cooper, an economic analyst and minimum wage researcher at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, didn’t dispute the numbers, but said ""overwhelmingly"" was off the mark. Cooper also argued that the focus on the national minimum wage provided a misleading demographic profile of low-wage workers. Many work for more than $7.25, and therefore are not counted as minimum-wage workers by the labor bureau, but earn the minimums set by their state, he noted. The average age of minimum wage workers goes up under this broader view, said Cooper. EPI supports increasing the national minimum wage. Some Democrats and President Barack Obama are pushing for a $10.10 minimum. Our rating On cable TV’s MSNBC, Walker said ""Jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce."" The best estimates are that 24 percent to 55 percent of such jobs are held by teenagers and young adults. That’s a lot, and from a relatively small component of the overall hourly-wage workforce, but his use of ""overwhelming"" strong suggests that a very large majority of those jobs are held by young people. They are not. We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEACAC0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/13/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-minimum-wage-jobs-are-overwhelmi/

Karl Rove says media coverage of Benghazi pales to coverage of Chris Christie bridge scandal
","New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has always attracted a fair amount of media attention. But when news broke last week that a close adviser and a top appointee allegedly orchestrated a traffic jam for political retribution, the Republican leader became the top news story of the day. In fact, Christie’s apology press conference, which lasted nearly two hours and attracted dozens of reporters and cameras, was aired in its entirety on CNN and MSNBC. On Fox News Sunday, Bob Woodward, the Washington Post journalist who helped uncover the Watergate scandal, said he wanted to see more reporting on how the events in New Jersey transpired. But Republican strategist and Fox News contributor Karl Rove said he also wanted more reporting on Benghazi and other incidents involving President Barack Obama. ""The amount of attention paid to Chris Christie makes the coverage of Benghazi, at the same time, the coverage of the IRS, pale in significance."" Rove said. In this fact-check we decided to focus on the comparison between the events, and the media coverage, in New Jersey and in Libya. Counting the stories Conservatives have long accused the media of covering up controversies in the Obama administration, including the attacks on a U.S. consulate in Libya that resulted in the deaths of ambassador Chris Stevens and three others, and reports that the IRS targeted tea party groups. Rove pointed us to reports from the Media Research Center, a conservative website critical of the press, highlighting what they say are disparities in the amount of coverage Christie garnered versus other scandals. We link to them here and here for your consideration. But we also conducted our own analysis to see if Christie’s coverage pales in significance to Benghazi. It’s fair to say the coverage of Christie’s week was significant. When the story first broke in New Jersey newspapers, every major outlet quickly followed their lead. By Sunday, Christie was a topic of debate on all of the political talk shows. Just how much was Christie in the news? A quick search through Lexis-Nexis, a research service that tracks the work of the media, found Christie’s name mentioned in 203 transcripts posted from the cable (CNN, Fox and MSNBC) and network (ABC, CBS and NBC) news outlets, plus National Public Radio. CNN led the way with 83 mentions. A simple search of ""Chris Christie"" and ""bridge"" also came up in 30 New York Times articles and 27 Washington Post articles, and 778 times in newspapers and wire stories across the country. Clearly, Christie became a national story. He is a well-known figure thought by many to be the GOP frontrunner for the presidential nomination in 2016, and a potential scandal in his administration instantly attracted widespread press attention. But how does that compare to the coverage of Benghazi? It’s tough to put the two controversies side-by-side. The Christie news, which broke under the nose of the New York media, has a clear starting point (when the New Jersey media first reported on it) and climax (Christie’s news conference). The events surrounding Benghazi garnered immediate attention, but had several watershed moments: Obama’s statement from the White House Rose Garden, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice’s news blitz pinning the attacks to an anti-Muslim YouTube video, the presidential debate between Obama and Republican Mitt Romney during which Benghazi was an issue, and the congressional hearings featuring Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, among other events. We decided to focus on the week after the attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya, which occurred Sept. 11, 2012. It’s a little bit longer of a time period to track (the Christie news broke mid-week so we have just four days of search results), but stick with us. Using the same news outlets we tracked for Christie, we found 250 transcripts that mentioned ""Benghazi."" Again, CNN led the way with 100 mentions. There were more than 2,800 stories that contain ""Benghazi"" in newspapers and wire services, though that also includes international newspapers. Domestically, the New York Times wrote 69 stories and the Washington Post had 49. Mainstream news outlets also gave airtime and space to Republicans who alleged a cover up on the part of the administration. During Oct. 18-25, 2012, when accusations were especially frequent, CNN and MSNBC referred to ""Benghazi cover up"" a combined 13 times. Benghazi was also competing for airtime against other large national news events, like the presidential election and later Hurricane Sandy. With Congress just returning to town, the scandal in Christie’s office broke during a relatively slow week in politics. How in-depth did they go? So that’s a quantitative breakdown. How about a qualitative analysis? Benghazi was a rare international story in 2012 in that Americans actually cared about it. According to the Pew Research Center for People and the Press, a nonpartisan think tank, 43 percent of the country told pollsters they ""closely followed"" the attacks in Benghazi. That made it the eighth most followed news event, trailing continued coverage of the economy and the U.S. Supreme Court decision on Obama’s health care law. It was the only international event in the top 10. Another 31 percent said they specifically followed the Libya investigation very closely. That says volumes about how much Americans were exposed to Benghazi reports in the media. And how about how closely media followed the events in Libya? Well, the New York Times, for starters, had three stories the day after the attack, Sept. 12, 2012. And soon they were starting to challenge early reports on what caused the attacks. By Sept. 13, the New York Times reported that there were actually two attacks on the embassy, ""the first one spontaneous and the second highly organized and possibly aided by anti-American infiltrators of Libya’s young government."" The New York Times did receive criticism from its own ombudsmen, public editor Margaret Sullivan, after the paper did not put on the front page an October congressional hearing on Benghazi. Instead, it was on A3. But after conservatives held up her column as proof of bias in the press, she penned another column on Oct. 20, 2012, stating ""it is utterly wrong to say that the Times has ignored or buried the Libya story. As of Friday, editors had placed it on the front page on 18 days out of 38, sometimes with news, sometimes with analysis. The coverage has been extensive, aggressive and sweeping."" The New York Times published an extensive investigation into the Benghazi attack last month. CNN was criticized strongly by the Obama administration for its initial coverage of Benghazi while questioning the White House narrative. The news outlet ran a heavily cited story documenting the final days of Ambassador Stevens from witness accounts. And when reporting on scene in Libya, CNN found Stevens’ personal diary and aired excerpts from the journal against the wishes of the U.S. State Department (and Stevens’ family). The network went on to win an award for its coverage of Benghazi. The New York Times and CNN are just singular examples, and there are others. Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of media and politics at University of Mary Washington, said ""at the end of the day, the media was an equal opportunity offender."" ""The coverage of Benghazi was heavy, in part because Republicans made an issue of it,"" said Farnsworth, author of Spinner in Chief: How Presidents Sell Their Policies and Themselves. ""The coverage of the ‘bridgegate,’ if you raise it to the level of a a ‘-gate’ scandal, is a reflection of Christie’s prominence in national politics."" Our ruling Rove said that the coverage of Christie pales ""in significance"" to the coverage of Benghazi. When news of the attacks on Benghazi broke, coverage was widespread, and it continued through congressional hearings. Moreover, a lot of the coverage questioned the administration’s narrative and response to the attacks. Indeed, Christie has occupied much of the conversation, but it was also in a relatively slow news week. Benghazi garnered significant coverage, even during the height of the presidential election. Perhaps the outcome of those reports didn’t unearth the conspiracy conservatives alleged and hoped for. More is still likely to come out, and Republicans continue to keep it in the news. But to insinuate the mainstream media ignored the attacks while putting Christie through the ringer goes too far. We rate Rove’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9F2280>],/factchecks/2014/jan/12/karl-rove/karl-rove-says-media-coverage-benghazi-pales-signi/
