Medical marijuana amendment doesn't allow local restrictions, opponents say
","Local governments will be powerless to prevent medical marijuana dispensaries from sprouting up anywhere and everywhere should Amendment 2 pass this fall, opponents of the measure say. A pamphlet from Vote No On 2 mailed to voters in July warns that the constitutional amendment prevents any kinds of restrictions on the locations of marijuana-related businesses. The amendment would allow doctors to recommend medical marijuana for certain health conditions and patients to pick up the drug from dispensaries that sell it. ""Because there's no local option to allow communities to ban, limit or restrict the location of pot shops, if Amendment 2 passes you can expect the seedy elements of the pot industry to move in right next door to your neighborhood, your church, your business and even your child's school,"" the pamphlet cautions. Vote No On 2 is a campaign run by the Drug Free Florida Committee, an anti-drug group started in 2014 by longtime GOP fundraiser Mel Sembler and his wife, Betty, with financial backing from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. We wanted to know whether Amendment 2 prevented communities from their own bans on so-called ""pot shops."" The short answer is that the amendment does not have any provisions for local legislation — but that’s only because the state would eventually be deciding whether local jurisdictions could do that. Amendment 2 redux First, let’s recall that Amendment 2 hit the ballot first in 2014, but just missed the 60 percent of the vote needed to pass. The current version for the November 2016 ballot has the same name, but United for Care, the group behind the measure, has altered the language for November 2016 to clear up confusion about the prior proposal. The amendment now requires parental consent and doctor certification for minors and more clearly defines the medical conditions it covers: cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis ""or other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class as or comparable to those enumerated,"" with a doctor’s recommendation. That means that if a doctor recommends medical marijuana for a patient with one of these conditions, the patient (or a certified caregiver) will get a state-issued ID card. That card allows them to buy marijuana at a state-regulated dispensary. There are some things to keep in mind about the whole process. Doctors are only recommending cannabis, because it’s illegal under federal law to prescribe a Schedule I drug — meaning it’s considered highly addictive and has no known medical benefits. Doctors would risk losing their ability to practice medicine if they prescribe marijuana. Pharmacies also can’t legally distribute cannabis, making dispensaries necessary. Dispensary suspense The state has estimated there could be almost 2,000 medical marijuana dispensaries in Florida should Amendment 2 pass, though there may be far fewer than that in reality. The proposed amendment requires the Legislature and the health department to figure out all the details of implementing medical marijuana should the measure pass — including the number of dispensaries and where they’re allowed to be. Vote No on 2 spokeswoman Christina Johnson pointed out to us that Amendment 2 does not include any language about a local option, and therefore doesn’t guarantee the state will allow them. The group believes that if a community passes an ordinance, the issue will have to be settled in court due to the amendment’s wording, and a right to access will trump local law. But the amendment also doesn’t prevent the state from letting local jurisdictions create their own rules. While no one knows exactly what will happen, chances are good that there will be some leeway for local rules. Kate Bell, legislative counsel for the Marijuana Policy Project, said it wouldn’t be appropriate for an amendment to try to codify regulations into the state’s constitution. Instead, regulations would have to spell out specifics, such as setbacks from schools and how dispensaries must follow local zoning laws. If the state doesn’t make distinct rules about dispensaries, local zoning rules would likely apply. The examples from other laws vary, as all 25 medical marijuana states (plus the District of Columbia) differ in their regulations. In New York, a rule says dispensaries can’t be within 1,000 feet of a ""school, church, synagogue or other place of worship."" In Washington, D.C., a dense urban area, dispensaries and cultivation centers where marijuana is grown may be no closer than 300 feet of a ""preschool, primary or secondary school, or recreation center."" Ordinances could be shaped into de facto bans, but there is some precedent for local governments being prevented from prohibiting dispensaries entirely. Maryland regulations say a licensed dispensary ""shall conform to all local zoning and planning requirements,"" but the state’s attorney general has said in an opinion that those rules can’t outright ban dispensaries. Arizona law says ""cities, towns and counties may enact reasonable zoning regulations that limit the use of land for registered nonprofit medical marijuana dispensaries to specified areas,"" but court rulings have said those laws can’t make opening a dispensary practically impossible. Pennsylvania’s law, passed earlier this year, prevented local ordinances from completely banning dispensaries. Andrew Livingston, a policy analyst for national law firm Vicente Sederberg, which represents marijuana businesses, said Florida is fairly unique in trying to pass a constitutional amendment with the expectation of marijuana storefronts. Nevada and Colorado passed constitutional amendments, and both allow local dispensary bans. He said almost all states that used voter-approved initiatives — like California, Oregon and Alaska — made the decision before the idea of dispensaries became popular. Those states focused on allowing patients or caregiver to grow their own plants, not buy them through state-approved dispensaries. ""There were no reasons to ban marijuana businesses because marijuana businesses were never mentioned in these earliest laws,"" Livingston said. There is no provision in the Florida amendment for patients to grow their own plants. As for Florida, we don’t have to wait to see whether towns or counties will create their own laws shunning medical marijuana. It’s already happening, in part because of a 2014 law allowing low-THC cannabis products for patients with muscle spasms, cancer, epilepsy and terminal illnesses. More than two dozen cities have regulated or completely banned medical marijuana sales. Boca Raton, for example, has a moratorium on medical marijuana dispensaries, cultivation, processing or distribution until city zoning rules are ironed out. Pasco County has banned any type of marijuana business. And while cannabis is still illegal in Plant City, the city commission passed an ordinance on Aug. 8 in anticipation of Amendment 2 winning at the polls. If federal law one day changes, medical marijuana dispensaries would be allowed, but they still have to be at least 500 feet from schools, churches, daycares, drug treatment centers, public parks and residential areas. Any dispensaries also would be confined to an area smaller than four acres in the city, next to a hospital and a fried chicken restaurant.   Our ruling Vote No On 2 said, ""Because there's no local option to allow communities to ban, limit or restrict the location of pot shops, if Amendment 2 passes you can expect the seedy elements of the pot industry to move in right next door to your neighborhood, your church, your business and even your child's school."" While the statement is technically accurate about the amendment’s wording, it’s highly doubtful there will be a dispensary on every corner. If it passes, the state will be in charge of writing regulations, including whether and how local jurisdictions will be able to create their own zoning laws or ordinances. It’s impossible to say with certainty what Florida’s regulations on dispensaries would look like should the amendment pass, as regulations in other medical marijuana states vary. But local bans or restrictive laws on dispensaries are common in medical marijuana states. Fears about the precise locations of pot shops and local control are premature. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809789BE00>],/factchecks/2016/aug/16/vote-no-2/medical-marijuana-amendment-doesnt-restrict-dispen/
"['National', 'Drugs', 'Marijuana', 'Gary Johnson']","
Is it true that marijuana hasn't caused any deaths, while prescription drugs have caused 100,000?
","Gary Johnson, the libertarian 2016 presidential candidate, recently assailed strict federal regulations on marijuana, saying that the drug causes far less harm when compared with legal drugs. Johnson was asked about the potential public health dangers of marijuana in states where it was recently legalized, during a CNN libertarian town hall on Aug. 3, 2016. He responded by arguing that the drug hasn’t actually killed anyone, and that prescription drugs are far more dangerous. ""I just think that so much research and development needs to take place that hasn't taken place. And that marijuana products deal -- or compete directly with legal prescription drugs that statistically kill 100,000 people a year, and there are no documented deaths due to marijuana."" Johnson later repeated the claim during an Aug. 10 interview with On Point with Tim Ashbrook, a call-in radio show. Many supporters of marijuana legalization like to say that the drug poses no grave risks to a person’s health, but how does it actually compare with prescription drugs in terms of death statistics? We decided to dive into the data to find out. Clearing up the contextual smoke One immediate problem with Johnson’s claim is that it leaves out important context about how a drug can actually kill someone. Drugs directly kill people through toxic overdoses, but they can also indirectly kill people by causing accidents. We’ll look at both cases for marijuana. (The Johnson campaign did not respond to requests for clarification.) We decided to look at direct overdose deaths first. It’s very difficult to overdose on marijuana’s active ingredient. A review study comparing the acute lethal toxicity of commonly abused drugs shows that the lethal dose for marijuana (around 15 grams or above) is at least 1,000 times greater than the effective dose (15 milligrams), or the dose required to achieve a noticeable effect. In contrast, alcohol can become lethal at only 10 times the effective dose. Additionally, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration drug sheet for marijuana reports that no deaths from marijuana overdose have ever been recorded. However, marijuana has played an indirect role in fatalities. Experts that we talked with agreed that the drug itself doesn’t cause major acute health problems and is far safer than other medications. However, they said that it can still dangerously inhibit someone’s ability to make safe decisions. Dr. Ryan Vandrey, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University who specializes in the behavioral effects of marijuana, stressed that looking only at deaths from direct overdoses is a narrow way of examining a drug’s health effects. ""Too often individuals cite that individuals haven’t died from cannabis -- I don’t think that’s true. It certainly can be argued that cannabis use has contributed to the deaths of individuals, such as due to impairment during driving,"" he said. Dr. Jerome Avorn, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, told us, ""The main risk from marijuana is from the risky or stupid things people do after using it, such as driving, rather than from any toxic effects of the substance itself, which is remarkably safe."" A 2013 literature review article noted that higher levels of THC in the blood are associated with substantial driving impairment and a higher risk of accidents, especially when combined with moderate alcohol consumption. However, the authors emphasized that more research needs to be done on the issue. Other accidental deaths involve marijuana users who seemingly became out of touch with reality and took reckless actions. A report from 2015 detailed the case of a 19-year-old male who jumped off a balcony after consuming multiple servings of a marijuana cookie. The study suggests that a high enough dose of THC can result in a greater risk of ""adverse psychological effects."" In summary, it appears that marijuana doesn’t directly cause overdose deaths, but there are documented cases where it likely led to accidental fatalities.The exact number of marijuana-related deaths that occur annually is difficult to pin down. One more caveat: synthetic marijuana has been attributed to overdose deaths. However, the experts we talked with told us that these drugs have nothing to do with marijuana and are a completely different class of substances. How about prescription drugs? As with marijuana, Johnson was unclear about whether he was referring to only prescription drug overdoses or to all deaths associated with prescription drugs, such as though allergies or deadly complications. Deaths from prescription drug overdoses are very common in the United States. The National Institute of Drug Abuse’s website shows that approximately 25,000 people died from prescription drug overdoses in 2014. Around 19,000 of these deaths came from prescription opioid pain relievers such as methadone and oxycodone. But Johnson said that prescription drugs, ""statistically kill 100,000 people every year."" Where is he getting his data from? There’s a study from 1998 that showed there were over 100,000 fatal ""adverse drug reactions"" in hospital patients in the U.S. However, the study is 18 years old, and the National Institute for Drug Abuse told us that the study was based on invalid calculations that overestimated the number of deaths. Dr. Avorn emphasized that counting all deaths from prescription drugs is ""horrendously complicated,"" and that estimates vary wildly. A recent article in the New York Times pointed out how the interplay between a large number of potential causes of death makes it difficult to determine how many people die from improperly administered prescription drugs or other ""medical errors."" Although Johnson’s claim is difficult to verify, the data show that at least tens of thousands of people do die from prescription drugs yearly. Our ruling Johnson said that marijuana competes with ""legal prescription drugs that statistically kill 100,000 people a year and there are no documented deaths due to marijuana."" Marijuana is far less toxic than many prescription painkillers, which kill tens of thousands of people every year. Marijuana has never killed anyone through overdose, but Johnson’s vague claim leaves out the crucial fact that marijuana has played a role in accidental deaths. And the number of prescription drug deaths isn't estimated to be as high as Johnson said.  The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate his claim Half True.   https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/455541b7-e999-4df3-be01-918edecb86ec",[<zip object at 0x00000280978BD540>],/factchecks/2016/aug/16/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-claims-marijuana-cant-kill-and-prescr/

Mike Pence half right that Obama has been ""raising taxes""
","Mike Pence, the Republican vice presidential nominee, says Americans are paying higher taxes under President Barack Obama. ""We’ve suffered through an administration that’s been raising taxes, raising regulations, growing government, borrowing and spending, and trying to bail our way back to a growing economy,"" Pence, the Indiana governor, said during an Aug. 4 rally in Norfolk. That’s a long list of charges, and we want to look at the first one - that the White House has been ""raising taxes."" Marc Lotter, Pence’s campaign spokesman, backed the governor’s statement by sending us a list of tax hikes enacted under Obama. The list, compiled by the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, contains a levy that Obama imposed on tobacco products as well as a series of taxes that were raised to fund the president’s health care reforms. We also contacted Roberton Williams, a fellow at the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. He told us that for the most part, there haven’t been many major tax changes during Obama’s term. That said, he pointed out two changes to tax laws under Obama. The first, as we’ve mentioned, were levies to pay for health care reforms in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Among them is the individual mandate penalty for not having health insurance; a 10 percent tax on tanning services; and a 3.8 percent surtax on investment income for high earners. Williams also cited the 2012 American Taxpayer Relief Act, which extended most of a series of income tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush. The Bush-era tax cuts had been set to expire in 2012. Obama signed a law that extended the cuts for all taxpayers except individuals making $400,000 a year or more and married filers earning $450,000 or more. Williams said only about 1 percent of taxpayers fit into those high-income categories. ""It was a really small share of people that got hit with higher taxes,"" he told us. ""It was really a tax cut for everybody else. … If Congress had done nothing, everybody’s taxes would have gone up."" Has the average federal tax burden on households increased under Obama? For that answer, we turned to a report issued in June by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It computed an average rate by factoring in individual and corporate taxes as well as payroll levies and excise taxes. The CBO figures are available only through 2013, but you still can get an idea of the trajectory of tax rates through most of Obama’s tenure. They show that in 2009, when Obama took office, the average household federal tax rate was 17.3 percent and in 2013, the rate was 20.1 percent - a nearly 3 percentage point increase. But Williams noted that 2009 is a low point to begin the comparison, in part because Obama enacted a federal tax cut that year as part of a stimulus package to combat the Great Recession. The average tax burden was 18.1 percent in 2008, the last year of the Bush administration. But that’s also a questionable year to start a comparison, Williams said, because the rate was lowered artificially by temporary tax cuts Bush approved to jump-start the economy. So we went back to 2007, when the average federal tax rate was 19.9 percent, or just under where it was in 2013. If you go back to 2006, the overall tax rate was 20.4, or slightly above where it was in 2013. The CBO figures show that in 2013, the average rate paid by people in the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers was lower than it was for those in the same income level in 2006 or 2007. The average rate for those in the top 20 percent, however, rose during that time. The Tax Policy Center last month released its own tallies of the average federal tax rate. The center calculates its figures differently than the CBO. For example, the center counts estate taxes in its tax rate figures, while the budget office doesn’t. The CBO includes the value of Medicare and Medicaid benefits in its income computations, while the Tax Policy Center doesn’t. One drawback to the Tax Policy Center’s figures is that they go back only to 2011. That year, the average federal tax rate came to 16.8 percent. By 2016, the average federal tax rate was 19.8 percent. That’s a 3 percentage point jump, but there’s a couple of things to keep in mind: Some of the temporary tax measures meant to stimulate the economy expired during that time. Chief among them is a temporary drop in the payroll tax from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent, an Obama-era measure that ended in 2012. Beyond policy decisions, changes in the economy also affect the average tax rate. The average tax rate has gone up as incomes have risen in the past five years and people have moved into higher tax brackets, Williams said. Our ruling Pence said that the Obama administration has been ""raising taxes."" Obama certainly raised some levies, including income taxes on people earning more than $400,000 a year. Although most folks don’t fall into that category, Obama’s health care reforms come with a series of new taxes that do affect lower earners. But Pence’s statement leaves a lot out of the story. Obama also has extended permanently tax cuts that were set to expire. He also enacted a series of temporary tax cuts aimed at jump-starting the economy. Figures from the CBO and the Tax Policy Center show that average tax rates have risen under Obama, but part of the reason is that Obama also allowed some special tax cuts enacted during the recession to expire. If you go back to CBO figures before the recession and compare them with figures after it ended, the average household tax rate was about the same in 2006 as it was in 2013. So on balance, we rate Pence’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976D9600>],/factchecks/2016/aug/16/mike-pence/mike-pence-half-right-obama-has-been-raising-taxes/

Donald Trump mischaracterizes NATO change and his role in it
","During what his campaign billed as a major foreign-policy address in Youngstown, Ohio, Donald Trump seemed to take credit for pushing NATO toward a sharper focus on terrorism. ""If I become president, the era of nation-building will be brought to a very swift and decisive end,"" Trump said. ""Our new approach -- which must be shared by both parties in America, by our allies overseas and by our friends in the Middle East -- must be to halt the spread of radical Islam. All actions should be oriented around this goal and any country which shares this goal will be our ally."" He went on to add, ""We will also work very closely with NATO on this new mission. I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats."" Trump has indeed mused publicly that NATO might be ""obsolete"" because the alliance is ""not meant for terrorism."" But we wondered whether he was correct to say that the U.S.-led military alliance has ""changed their policy and now (has) a new division focused on terror threats."" As it turns out, we found very little accurate with this statement. What change at NATO is he referring to? We didn’t hear back from Trump’s campaign, and unlike other portions of the prepared speech, this particular claim was not documented with footnotes. However, when we checked with experts on NATO and terrorism, several said the likeliest change that Trump would have been referring to was the creation of an assistant secretary general for intelligence and security to head a newly established Joint Intelligence and Security Division. Trump has previously tweeted out a Wall Street Journal story on the news and said the alliance ""made the change without giving me credit.""  The new position was officially announced in a communiqué released on July 9, 2016, by member-state representatives at a summit in Warsaw, Poland. Here’s what the document said: ""To position the Alliance in responding to evolving threats, NATO intelligence reform must be an ongoing, dynamic process. ... To improve NATO's ability to draw on a wide range of intelligence resources, we have agreed to establish a new Joint Intelligence and Security Division to be led by an Assistant Secretary General for Intelligence and Security. The new Assistant Secretary General for Intelligence and Security will direct NATO's intelligence and security activities, ensuring better use of existing personnel and resources, while maximizing the efficient use of intelligence provided by Allies."" Was this a major change? Not really, experts say. ""NATO members have been complaining about sharing of intelligence for generations,"" said Stephen M. Saideman, a professor of international affairs at Carleton University in Canada who had a fellowship on the U.S. Joint Staff at NATO in 2001. ""Every year or two, there is a discussion about how to improve intel sharing."" This change, he said, was ""not that important."" Jorge Benitez, director of NATOSource at the Atlantic Council, agreed. ""While the top position is new, it seems most of the staff will come from an internal reorganization of NATO bureaucracy, rather than new additions,"" he said. ""This is because the summit communique describes this new NATO division as making ‘better use of existing personnel and resources.’ "" More to the point, Trump’s comment gives the impression that NATO hadn’t been responsive to terrorism until the new division was created. That’s not true at all. NATO involvement in counter-terrorism issued its first formal declaration on terrorism in 1980, and it became a significant issue for the alliance on Sept. 11, 2001, said Lisa Sawyer Samp, a senior fellow in the international security program of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""NATO invoked Article 5, its collective defense provision, the day after the 9/11 attacks and has focused on dealing with this threat ever since, including most importantly by deploying troops for the past 12 years in Afghanistan,"" said Ivo H. Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who previously served as Ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama. At its peak, NATO and its partners sent about 40,000 troops to Afghanistan, Benitez said, and this year, there are still about 4,000 troops from NATO allies in Afghanistan. ""It is impossible to argue that NATO has not played an overwhelmingly important role in the war on terror,"" said Timothy Andrews Sayle, an assistant professor of modern global security at the University of Toronto. It’s worth noting that, according to experts, NATO’s structure and role has made it an imperfect vehicle for counter-terrorism. ""Allied warfare is exceptionally difficult and fraught with problems of coordination and compatibility,"" Sayle said. Intelligence sharing has been especially challenging -- a shortcoming that the new position was designed to ease. NATO’s post-9/11 terrorism blueprint did undergo one major overhaul -- but that occurred in 2012, several years before Trump started running for president. The overhaul, as announced at a summit in Wales, states that ""the Alliance strives at all times to remain aware of the evolving threat from terrorism; to ensure it has adequate capabilities to prevent, protect against, and respond to terrorist threats."" ""So it took about a decade to update the initial post-9/11 framework for dealing with terrorism,"" said Matthew Fay, a defense policy analyst with the Niskanen Center. Did Trump have anything to do with it? Despite Trump’s desire for credit, this is the part where his statement goes off the rails. Trump strongly implies that NATO acted because of his concerns. But experts agree that nothing of the sort happened. For starters, experts said, leaders of the NATO countries feel little warmth for Trump, suggesting that they wouldn’t do anything to bolster his prospects of becoming president. ""It is comical to suggest NATO would change its counterterrorism policy in response to anything Donald Trump has said about it over the course of his campaign,"" Fay said. ""Like his claim that he was against the invasion of Iraq, this is another reflection of the Republican nominee living in a foreign policy world of his own creation."" Even more important are the structural obstacles -- namely, that an alliance as broad as NATO tends to take longer to get all its members to sign off on strategic changes. ""This is almost certainly just an odd coincidence,"" Sayle said. ""The position would be the result of a very long slog by those who have favored the idea against those who may believe the alliance too large and diffuse to be effective – or safe – for sharing detailed intelligence."" Saideman agreed. ""NATO never works fast on anything, and most of the major changes are timed to be announced at summits like the Warsaw Summit or smaller meetings where defense ministers and foreign ministers meet."" Finally, NATO rejected the notion that Trump had anything to do with the change in a statement to Politico. Our ruling Trump said, ""I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats."" The change he’s apparently referring to -- the creation of a new senior post and division for coordinating intelligence sharing -- is just the most recent incremental change in how the alliance handles counter-terrorism, a topic it has addressed, in big ways and small, for more than 30 years. There is no evidence that the change was made in response to Trump’s complaints about the alliance. Experts said such changes typically require a longer gestation period so that all member nations can get on board. We rate Trump’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8a31e8b1-2a03-46dc-a5d1-1f4bd0191fd1",[<zip object at 0x000002809C00B6C0>],/factchecks/2016/aug/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-mischaracterizes-nato-change-and-his-/

Viral post alleges voter fraud in Wood County, Ohio
","A viral image is making new rounds on the Internet, asking, ""Ever wonder why Republicans want Voter ID?"" Similar claims popped up after the 2012 election between President Barack Obama and the former governor of Massachusetts, Republican Mitt Romney. Our national and Florida fact-checkers have debunked several examples within this viral image already (check here and here). We wondered if claims about Ohio counties were any more accurate. In northwest Ohio, Wood County is home to Bowling Green, the city and university of the same name. The first statement reads, ""In 21 districts in Wood County, Ohio, Obama received 100 percent of the votes where GOP inspectors were illegally removed from their polling locations — and not one single vote was recorded for Romney. (A statistical impossibility.)"" The second statement says that ""106,258 people in Wood County are registered to vote out of an eligible 98,213."" The third says, ""In one Ohio county, Obama won by 108 percent of the total number of eligible voters."" Is something rotten in Wood? These claims unravel quickly with a check of 2012 poll results. 100 percent of the vote? We’ll start with the claim about Obama getting 100 percent of the votes in 21 Wood County ""districts."" First off, in Ohio they’re called precincts, not districts. A precinct-by-precinct check shows that neither presidential candidate received 100 percent of the votes in any of the county’s 97 precincts. (Therefore, Romney also earned votes, contrary to the claim.) Other fact-checkers also cast doubt on these allegations. As fellow fact-checkers at Snopes rightly noted, ""The highest percentage (Obama) achieved in any one precinct was 75.5 percent."" FactCheck.org asked Terry Burton, director of the elections board in Wood County, about GOP inspectors being removed. ""No precinct officials were removed during Election Day and no issues were identified during a recount,"" he answered. Ghost registrations Now for the post’s second statement about over-registrations. The 98,213 number comes from the 2010 census total of people 18 and over in Wood County. According to the election board’s data from 2012, there were 108,014 registered voters in the county at that time — an even bigger gap between people and voters than what the meme claimed. But that doesn’t mean there is foul play. PolitiFact Ohio found that the discrepancy is owed to the large population of college kids at Bowling Green. Students register to vote there and later graduate and move away, abandoning their voter registrations along with their raggedy couches.   Elections officials are allowed to purge the rolls of inactive voters after they miss three successive federal elections — a practice that Ohio’s Secretary of State Jon Husted has defended as Election Day 2016 approaches. 108 percent Now let’s consider the post’s vague reference to ""one Ohio county"" where Obama allegedly got 108 percent of the vote. The numbers for Wood County, where the meme suggests that fraud is so rampant, lead us to believe that this is still about Wood. The number of registered voters, 106,258, is about 108 percent of 98,213, the size of the vote-eligible population in 2012. But election results show that in real life, Obama received 51 percent of the vote in Wood County. We asked Carol DeJong, deputy director of the Wood County Board of Elections, why conspiracy theorists are obsessed with her county. ""As a reporter, you would be better at solving that mystery,"" she replied via email. Our ruling A viral post makes several claims about 2012 voter fraud in Ohio, ginning up fears ahead of the 2016 presidential election. But the election tallies discredit the claims about voter fraud in Ohio. Election board officials cannot corroborate the claim of GOP monitors being ""illegally removed"" from polling places. The numbers 106,258 (registered voters) and 98,213 (residents old enough to vote) include the ghost registrations of inactive voters that lingered on the rolls. Finally, Obama got 51 percent of the vote in Wood County, not 108 percent. This viral image is 108 percent wrong.

Gary Johnson said the Pentagon has endorsed eliminating 20 percent of military bases
","When it comes to saving money in the federal budget, presidential candidates are often long on generalities and short on specifics. But libertarian candidate Gary Johnson offered a few specifics when interviewed Aug. 11 on Fox News. ""Bill Weld (Johnson's vice presidential candidate) and I are pledging in our first 100 days to submit a balanced budget to Congress,"" he said. ""That has to include the entitlements — reform to the entitlements, Medicaid and Medicare, ensuring that there still is a safety net. It would be reforming Social Security, not cutting Social Security, but raising the retirement age. You could have a very fair means-testing when it comes to Social Security."" Then Johnson turned to military spending, saying, ""The Pentagon itself says that we could reduce U.S. bases by 20 percent, and yet there's not the political will to do that. Our heads are in the sand over all of this, while there's a fiscal crisis out there looming if we don't cut spending to go along with the equation."" He repeated the point about military installations less than a minute later: ""The Pentagon itself says that we could eliminate 20 percent of U.S. bases."" We wondered if Johnson's base statistic was correct. We found a more complicated situation than Johnson suggested, with cost-savings slow in coming. When we asked the Johnson campaign about it, they sent us links to two articles, one from Defense News, the other from Military Times. Both detail the results of a Pentagon report which looked at 251 military installations but did not recommend cutting 20 percent of them. Instead, the report said the bases have, in total, 22 percent more installation space and infrastructure than the military will need, based on force levels projected for 2019. That could mean getting rid of a lot of small bases, or a few large ones, once operations are consolidated. For example, the report said that, overall, the Army has a 29 percent excess in administrative space, the Marine Corps has 27 percent more base acreage than it needs, and the Air Force has 24 percent more space than required for parking Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard planes.  Exactly where the cuts would be made and where the consolidations occur could be determined by a bipartisan commission known as the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) commission, which would come up with a comprehensive plan. Or the Pentagon could act on its own. In either case, such decisions are politically volatile because no member of Congress wants an installation closed in their district. The BRAC process is intended to ensure closures are made based on the merits, not on political influence. Two more things are important to note. Although the Pentagon report is saying that it has 22 percent more base capacity than it needs, that doesn't mean it wants to reduce its capacity by the full amount, which could could hamper the military's flexibility. A BRAC review ""is not designed to eliminate all excess,"" the report cautions. ""The focus of every BRAC round is to reduce excess where needed in balance with the need to have room for changed missions, tactics, and technology while enhancing military value and achieving recurring savings."" Second, even if there was a 22 percent reduction in capacity, that wouldn't guarantee a savings of 22 percent. Historically, in the short run, the cutbacks actually cost more more than they save because of consolidation and other costs. The report estimates that if the military initiated a BRAC and trimmed its military base costs, it would cost an extra $7 million over six years to implement. After that, the military would be saving $2 billion annually. Yet those estimates need to be regarded with skepticism. The last BRAC was done in 2005. It closed 24 bases, changed operations in 24 others and eliminated roughly 12,000 civilian jobs. As PolitiFact reported last year, it was supposed to save $3.9 billion a year. But because it cost $35.1 billion to implement (the original estimate was $21 billion) actual savings won't begin to accrue until 2018, five years later than originally projected. Our ruling Johnson said, ""The Pentagon itself says that we could eliminate 20 percent of U.S. bases."" What the Pentagon actually said was that the Defense Department has 22 percent more installation space and infrastructure than it's going to need in 2019. That's not the same as reducing the number of bases by 20 percent, as Johnson said. Past experience shows that closing bases involves upfront expenses, with savings taking some time to accrue.  Because his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C18AAC0>],/factchecks/2016/aug/15/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-said-pentagon-has-endorsed-eliminatin/

Texas Democrat says half of Hispanic college students rely on Pell grants
","Proposed education appropriations legislation from the Republican-controlled U.S. House would cut Pell Grant funding in fiscal 2017 by $1.3 billion to $21.1 billion. Despite the overall funding cut, Pell Grant maximum amounts are due to rise in the 2016-2017 award year to $5,815 from $5,775 in the 2015-2016 award year. Pell Grants, started by Congress in 1972, are awarded to financially needy students who haven’t yet earned a bachelor’s or professional degree. The proposed funding ""cut"" is because some -- like Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who chairs the House subcommittee that drafted the legislation -- says the Pell Grant program has been running a surplus for years and that money would be better spent elsewhere. Yet the proposal drew rebukes from education groups and more than 100 Democratic members of Congress. While there is a $7.7 billion surplus in Pell dollars, Kelly McManus of the Education Trust, a Washington-based group focused on academic achievement by students that has registered opposition to the proposed reductions, said that money should be devoted to providing grants to more students. Opponents of the proposed cuts include retiring U.S. Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, D-Mercedes, who tweeted in June 2016: ""50% of Hispanic students count on Pell Grants to pay for college: 1.usa.gov/1WNY90D #ProtectPell https://twitter.com/USRepRHinojosa/status/743577402299777024"" We wondered if Hinojosa got it right that half of Hispanic students lean on Pell Grants for college. Emails to his office went unanswered. But a web search led us to a 2011 report by Mark Kantrowitz, author of ""The Distribution of Grants and Scholarships by Race,"" a report tracking Pell Grant distributions by race and ethnicity based on data collected for 2003-04 and 2007-08 about how students and their families paid for postsecondary education. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) is conducted every three to four years by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which draws on administrative records plus parent and student interviews At the time of Hinojosa’s tweet, Kantrowitz told us by email, the most recent available data were from 2011-2012. Otherwise, Kantrowitz advised, data covering 2015-16 will available in 2017. So, what do the latest numbers show about the share of Hispanic students getting Pell grants? According to the 2011-2012 NPSAS data, 50 percent of Hispanic undergraduates received a Pell Grant that year; the average award to those students was $3,500. At our request, Kantrowitz did his own analysis of the 2011-2012 counts of grant recipients using race/ethnicity -- setting aside foreign students -- and looking at all recipients of a federal Pell Grant during 2011-2012. Kantrowitz told us: ""50.8% of students in the Hispanic or Latino category received federal Pell Grants, compared with 33.7% of students in the White category and 62.7% of students in the Black or African American category. If I group together all the minority students, 53.7% of minority students received Pell Grants."" In recent years, the share of Hispanic students drawing the grants has surged, according to a custom report compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics for PolitiFact that showed Hispanics, excluding Puerto Rico, had sat in the mid- to high-20s for percent with Pell Grants through the 1990s. The biggest jump was between 2007-2008 and 2011-2012, when the number of Hispanics receiving the grants increased from 35.7 percent to the 50 percent mark. Wondering why the percentage of Hispanic students getting grants has surged, we reached out to Deborah A. Santiago with Excelencia in Education, a D.C.-based nonprofit organization that says it ""accelerates Latino student success in higher education."" Santiago said by email that the increase in Hispanic students receiving grants tracks with a 30 percent increase in Hispanic enrollment in higher education between 2008 and 2012. That spurt, Santiago said, included a 4 percent uptick in Hispanic enrollment in four-year institutions, which are typically more costly to attend than two-year schools. Santiago agreed too that the Great Recession helps explain the increase ""since incomes decreased and more who could not find jobs enrolled in higher education,"" she said.   And did other ethnic groups experience similar spikes? Black students did. Per the NSPAS data, nearly 62 percent of such students got grants in 2011-12 compared with 46 percent in 2007-2008. The figures show that in 2011-2012, 33.5 percent of white students received Pell Grants valued at an average of $3,300, while 61.9 percent of black undergraduates received Pell Grants at an average of $3,400 per scholarship. About 34 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander undergraduates had Pell Grants at an average of $3,800 each -- but they also had the highest average price of attendance at $20,000. But Hispanic Pell Grant recipients had the lowest rate of student loans, with only 50.1 percent having student loans compared to 64.7 percent of white Pell Grant recipients and 65.8 percent of black grant holders. Our ruling Hinojosa said ""50% of Hispanic students count on Pell Grants to pay for college.""

"['National', 'Elections', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump's baseless claims about the election being 'rigged'
","Donald Trump preemptively challenged the results of the November presidential election, claiming in media appearances and rallies that the entire system is ""rigged."" Trump’s charges of election fraud are not new to his campaign. He’s tweeted about dead voters delivering President Barack Obama’s victory in 2012, floated charges about multiple voting in the primaries, and suggested that undocumented immigrants ""just walk in and vote"" in some polling places. Trump revived these theories as he fell behind Hillary Clinton in the polls (which, according to his surrogates, are ""skewed""). ""Nov. 8, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged,"" he said at an Aug. 1 rally in Columbus, Ohio. ""People are going to walk in and they're going to vote 10 times, maybe, who knows?"" ""I know last time, you had precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the Republican (Mitt Romney),"" he said to Fox News’ Sean Hannity that same night. ""I’m telling you, Nov. 8, we better be careful because that election is going to be rigged and I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or it’s going to be taken away from us."" This is a serious allegation that challenges the integrity of the election, so we asked the Trump campaign to elaborate. We didn’t hear back. When Trump has offered specifics — people voting though they’re ineligible, people voting multiple times, people impersonating dead voters — he’s actually talking about voter fraud, committed by individuals and committed very rarely. Stolen 2012 election? To sow doubts about the 2016 election, Trump pointed to alleged rigging in 2012. While some precincts in Philadelphia exclusively voted for Obama in 2012, it’s grasping for straws to claim this is evidence for election rigging. Defending Trump, Fox’s Sean Hannity pointed to a Philadelphia Inquirer article that showed 59 precincts in inner-city Philadelphia in which ""Mitt Romney did not get a single vote, not one."" But Hannity leaves out that the same article also stated that ""such results may not be so startling after all."" The Inquirer wrote that 75 to 80 percent of voters in big cities like Philadelphia identify as Democrats, and 93 percent of African-Americans voted for Obama. When the paper sought out the few registered Republicans living in the 59 districts, it found that several had moved, others didn’t realize they were registered with the party, and others confirmed that they had voted for Obama despite their political identification. Election inspector Ryan Godfrey, an independent who was a Republican in 2012, called Hannity’s claims ""absurd and personally insulting."" After all, Godfrey argued, there’s a paper trail for the ballots in Philly and no evidence that he and the other election officials had risked prosecution to collude against Romney.   Plus, CNN’s Brian Stelter countered, ""a Google search would show that there are also precincts in other states, like in Utah, where Obama did not get a single vote."" Trumped up charges of voter fraud Trump’s claims of voter fraud, which echo arguments for voter ID laws, are also not reflective of reality. While the U.S. Government Accountability Office has acknowledged that it’s difficult to estimate how often voter fraud happens based on reported incidents, the evidence for rampant fraud is lacking. News 21 found just 150 alleged cases of double voting, 56 cases of noncitizens voting, and 10 cases of voter impersonation across all elections from 2000 to 2011. Many of these never led to charges, while others were acquitted or dismissed. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School and an expert on voter fraud, found an even smaller number: 31 credible incidents out of more than 1 billion votes cast from 2000 to 2014. Put it in another way: You’re more likely to get struck by lightning than to find voter fraud. When voter fraud does occur, it’s not always intentional. Multiple studies have traced known cases not to willful deception but to clerical errors or confusion. For example, one case of a dead person voting (Alan J. Mandell) happened because a poll worker accidentally marked his name instead of the man who actually cast the ballot, Alan J. Mandel. Similarly, in one of just five cases of a noncitizen voting between 2000 and 2004, a permanent resident was told he was eligible and given a voter registration form by a DMV clerk when renewing his license. So, given the rarity of occurrence, the lack of intent, and a federal penalty of a $10,000 fine or up to five years in prison, experts say it would be extremely difficult to rig an election through the ways Trump has suggested. ""I'd like to see him try to vote 10 times on Election Day. It would be virtually impossible and a knuckle-headed way to try to corrupt an election,"" said Lorraine Minnite, a political science professor at Rutgers University who wrote The Myth of Voter Fraud.   To sway an election, an army of voters would have to visit multiple polling locations each, know the names and addresses of the people they were impersonating and produce fake ID’s or forge their signatures — plus be willing to commit perjury the entire time. ""Campaigns don’t pay people to pretend to be people they’re not. That’s too stupid,"" said Mary Frances Berry, former chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and author of Five Dollars and a Pork Chop Sandwich, a book about electoral fraud. How to rig an election From New York’s Tammany Hall to the motto of ""vote early and often"" popularized in Chicago, election fraud is certainly part of U.S. political history. But election rigging today is constrained to local elections, as implementing a national election heist would be extremely difficult. ""Given the decentralized nature of our elections, there would be no single way to throw the results,"" said Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine. ""Instead you’d have to target enough states to make a difference in the Electoral College."" The first way is through buying votes, especially absentee ballots. Berry’s Five Dollars and a Pork Chop Sandwich, which refers to the prize a Louisiana woman received for her vote, documents several cases of local campaigns and political machines purchasing votes, often from nursing homes and poor communities, in exchange for cash, whiskey or a paved driveway. This is possible on a small scale because of a ""corrupt deal"" between local election officials and ""family fiefdoms"" with deep roots in municipal politics, Berry said. Presidential elections, on the other hand, are under much more scrutiny than sheriff races and subject to federal prosecution. For that reason, and given how complicated organizing the conspiracy across different communities would be, Berry says it’s not probable that a national campaign or outside group would take the risk to buy a few votes. The second way of rigging elections is through tampering with voting machines (looking at you, Olivia Pope of Scandal). Trump suggested this in 2012 when he warned that machines were switching Romney votes to Obama. ""That’s not an indication of the system being rigged. That’s an indication that it’s lost its calibration,"" said Pamela Smith of Verified Voting, which monitors technological issues in elections. She added that Trump likely was referring to voter reports of this common issue of overuse, while election rigging ""would require you not noticing."" (Smith couldn’t think of any examples of machines being tampered with and said, from her research, issues usually result from programming errors.) Ballots cast on some electronic voting systems, however, don’t have a paper trail, meaning the votes are not verifiable. Hackers could theoretically alter the results. But this would also require a potential wrongdoer to physically access the machines on Election Day and serious coordination to circumvent all the security and auditing measures in place before, during and after voting, said Smith, adding, ""There are very few paths in the present scenario to flip something off the radar."" There’s the added security of Pennsylvania law, which mandates post-election vote audits of randomly selected precincts. The majority of precincts in Virginia rely on paper ballots. And Florida, where use of electronic machines is fairly limited to providing accessibility for voters with disabilities, has a Republican governor (Gov. Rick Scott, a Trump supporter) and secretary of state (who oversees elections). ""Technological rigging or the more classic stuffing of the ballot box are not the kind of things that could be easily done or on the kind of scale that could affect an election,"" Hasen said. ""Trump’s unsupported allegations are dangerous and fantasy."" Our ruling Trump has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. election system is rigged. He has cited examples of voter fraud, which is extremely rare, often unintentional and not on a scale large enough to affect a national election. While there are isolated examples of bought local elections, experts say it cannot be replicated on a national scale. While it is possible to tamper with electronic voting machines, there is no evidence deliberate malfeasance has altered any election.

"['Guns', 'Pennsylvania', 'Independence USA PAC']","
Did Pat Toomey ‘cross party lines’ to tighten gun laws for suspected terrorists?
","As Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey battles for re-election in one of the most important senate races in the nation, it’s been his record on guns that’s drawn some of the most attention. It’s apparently part of why former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Toomey, and Bloomberg’s political action committee is now running ads in support of Toomey that tout his efforts to ""put our safety ahead of partisan politics."" The Independence USA PAC bankrolled an ad running in Pennsylvania that claims ""Toomey crossed party lines twice: first to support background checks, and now to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list."" We’ve written before about Toomey signing on in 2013 and putting his name on a bill that would have expanded background checks. But what about his efforts to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list? Toomey’s record there is a bit murkier. To be clear: A bill that would stop gun sales to suspects on any sort of terror watch list has not passed. Efforts were made after the June shooting in Orlando at Pulse Nightclub, the deadliest mass shooting in American history, which left 49 people and the shooter dead. But those efforts were fruitless. There were several major bills drafted in the wake of Orlando that would have closed what’s been called ""the terror loophole,"" or would make it harder for suspected terrorists on the federal government’s radar to buy guns. Two such bills -- both with largely partisan backing -- were brought up for a vote on June 20 and both were defeated. Proponents of a ban on gun sales to those on a terror watch list say individuals who are suspected terrorists appear on a no-fly list, but are still allowed to purchase guns. Opponents worry individuals who accidentally end up on the no-fly list would be stripped of their second amendment rights. The Democrats’ bill was a plan by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, and her bill would have placed a blanket ban on the purchase of guns by those on the no-fly list, as it was dubbed ""no-fly, no buy."" Some Republicans argued her bill didn’t give an out to people who may have ended up on the watch list mistakenly. Two Republicans voted in favor of Feinstein’s bill. Toomey wasn’t one of them, saying the bill didn’t include enough due process for potential gun owners. The majority of Republicans supported a bill from Sen. John Cornyn, of Texas. His measure, which was backed by the National Rifle Association, would have placed a three-day hold when anyone on the terror watch list attempted to purchase a gun. Within those three days, the government would have to present a case before a court in order to stop the person from buying the firearm. Though Toomey said in June that it would be hard for law enforcement to make Cornyn’s measure ""workable,"" he voted in favor of it in the end. Toomey also drafted his own bill to close the terror loophole, which he touted as a measure that would bridge the gap between the Feinstein and the Cornyn amendments. Under Toomey’s plan, the U.S. attorney general would generate a list of ""likely terrorists"" separate from the existing no-fly list. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court would review the list, and the attorney general would have the power to block the purchase of a gun by an individual on that list. But Toomey’s bill largely flopped. Though he was reportedly in talks with gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety, the group ultimately didn’t endorse his proposal. Republican leaders didn’t put it up for a vote, and Democrats largely opposed it. When PolitiFact reached out to Toomey’s campaign to inquire about his record when it comes to closing the terror loophole, his campaign pointed out that Toomey was one of eight Republicans to support an amendment from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that would have given the Justice Department the ability to deny gun sales to individuals on two terror-related lists -- and it had an appeal process. That bill, which Toomey spoke on the Senate floor in favor of, had bipartisan support and survived a ""test vote"" several days after the Feinstein and Cornyn amendments failed. That showed that the bill had significant support, but not the 60 votes it would need to advance -- meaning GOP leaders probably won’t bring it up for a full vote any time soon. Independence USA, which is running the ads in Pennsylvania, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Our Ruling In an ad running in Pennsylvania, the Independence USA PAC backed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg claimed ""Toomey crossed party lines… to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list."" This ad is misleading at its core, largely because a measure to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list never passed. Toomey’s own bill failed to garner significant support from either side of the aisle. Though he voted for the Collins amendment which had bipartisan support, that amendment was drafted by a Republican. In the end, Toomey voted with his party when he voted against Feinstein’s bill and in favor of Cornyn’s. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D9A100>],/factchecks/2016/aug/15/independence-usa-pac/did-pat-toomey-cross-party-lines-tighten-gun-laws-/
"['Immigration', 'PunditFact', 'Lisa Boothe']","
Republican strategist says 25 percent of inmates are illegal immigrants
","The United States should be paying attention to immigration and public safety issues in Europe and taking notes on how to handle them in America, argued Republican strategist Lisa Boothe. Terrorists have been apprehended at the U.S. southern border, and immigrant incarceration rates are significant, she said. ""You also look at the criminal justice system. One in four inmates are illegal immigrants,"" Boothe said July 26 on Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor. She was reacting to an earlier interview about border security O’Reilly had with Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., during the second night of the Democratic National Convention. We wondered if 25 percent of inmates are people who are in the country illegally. Boothe told us her comment was based on a Heritage Foundation analysis about illegal immigration and border security. Citing a U.S. Government Accountability Office, the foundation noted that ""one of every four inmates in federal prisons is an illegal immigrant."" The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, referred to a March 2011 GAO report on incarcerations, arrests and costs of criminal immigrants. That report says that ""in fiscal year 2005, the criminal alien population in federal prisons was around 27 percent of the total inmate population, and from fiscal years 2006 through 2010 remained consistently around 25 percent."" But the report’s definition of ""alien"" is broad and includes people here legally. It defines criminal aliens as ""noncitizens who are residing in the United States legally or illegally and are convicted of a crime."" So, about one in four inmates in federal prison is not a U.S. citizen, but not necessarily with an illegal immigration status. The accurate number is likely less than one in four, but precise data on the immigration status of inmates is hard to come by. Related data is collected differently by federal agencies and not inclusive of all facilities. A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman told us her agency does not have data on the number of inmates who are in the country illegally. The Federal Bureau of Prisons also told us it does not track data on immigration status of its inmates. But it does have statistics on inmate citizenship. About 22 percent of the bureau’s inmates are not U.S. citizens, based on information updated June 25, 2016. Its count of noncitizen inmates includes people who may be deported. As for state facilities, a Bureau of Justice Statistics report published in September 2015 said that by year-end 2014, there were about 1.56 million prisoners in both state and federal correctional facilities. About 69,000 of them — or 4 percent — were not U.S. citizens. But it didn’t break down the noncitizen category by legal or illegal immigration status.                 That data excludes noncitizen inmates in local jails under jurisdiction of state or federal correctional authorities and noncitizens in privately contracted facilities. The private facilities house deportable immigrants serving federal sentences and once they finish their sentences, they are turned over to ICE. Overall, there doesn’t appear to be an absolute number of incarcerated undocumented immigrants. ""There is no definitive source that reports legal status of those arrested or incarcerated,"" said Anne Morrison Piehl, a professor of economics and criminal justice at Rutgers University, who has researched the relationship between immigration and crime. Unlike race, age and gender, the immigration status of an inmate isn’t often asked, said Ramiro Martinez, a professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University. Most inmates are native-born and most states have a small foreign-born population, so immigration status is not relevant to most of the prisoner population, Martinez said. And most immigrants in state and federal prisons are in for property or immigration offenses, Martinez added. Studies by Piehl and a colleague also have found that immigrants have much lower incarceration rates than the native-born population. ""There is no reason to think that immigration in general presents a particular crime threat,"" they concluded. Our ruling Republican strategist Lisa Boothe said on Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor ""one in four inmates is an illegal immigrant."" The data Boothe cited included immigrants who were here legally and illegally. So it’s likely that number is at least somewhat inflated. Federal agencies say they don’t track data on inmates in the country illegally, and several immigration experts told us there’s no definitive source for that specific number. We rate Boothe’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C17DCC0>],/factchecks/2016/aug/15/lisa-boothe/republican-strategist-says-25-percent-inmates-are-/
"['Nevada', 'Social Security', '  AFSCME']","
Union-backed ad repeats inaccurate claim that Joe Heck wants to privatize Social Security
","A well-worn Democratic attack line is being repeated in Nevada’s Senate race, with a major union dropping seven figures on a new television ad attacking Republican candidate Joe Heck. The political arm of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees is running several ads warning viewers that Heck would be a ""threat"" to the future of the entitlement program. ""In Washington, Congressman Joe Heck supports privatizing it, turning our savings over to Wall Street and risking it on the stock market."" the ad says. ""Heck's plan means billions more for Wall Street, and they've donated over half a million dollars to his campaign."" The donations aspect of the ad is relatively straightforward, as the securities and investment industry has donated $525,569 to Heck throughout his congressional career, according to an OpenSecrets.com tally (roughly 73 percent of that sum coming during his current Senate run). But the main claim of the ad, that Heck would ""privatize"" Social Security and subsequently jeopardize the program’s fiscal stability, is one that PolitiFact and other Nevada journalists have called inaccurate on multiple occasions. Democrats have used the specter of Republican-led efforts to privatize Social Security as a political boogeyman since at least 2005, when then-President George W. Bush unsuccessfully proposed a plan to quasi-privatize the entitlement program for younger workers. Many Republicans (not just Heck and Bush) have supported adding optional private accounts for younger workers as a way to extend the life of the entitlement program, which is scheduled to run out of reserve funds in 2034 and be unable to pay out full benefits to future beneficiaries. Here’s what Heck has actually proposed or has mentioned as a potential change for the entitlement program: Indexing the retirement age from 67 to 69 by one month per year for the next 24 years; Allowing younger workers to voluntarily invest retirement funds directed toward Social Security into other private markets; Possibly raising the cap on earnings to which the Social Security tax applies ($118,500 in 2015). It’s that second point that AFSCME says backs up the claim that Heck wants to ""privatize"" Social Security. (Heck calls it a ""diversified investment."") This is somewhat of an argument over semantics: Is Heck’s proposal privatization or not? PolitiFact has generally found that support for voluntary private Social Security accounts for younger workers doesn’t merit the sort of concerns or consequences implied by a ""full privatization"" of the program. The vast majority of Republicans, including Heck, say they’re adamantly opposed to making any changes that would affect those already receiving benefits or about to enter the program. It’s misleading of the ad to suggest that Nevada senior citizens could lose ""our savings"" given that Heck has never called for changes to be made for current beneficiaries. AFSCME did point to several reports on the potential fiscal cost of a quasi-privatized option, most of which were published nearly a decade ago when the Bush administration was pushing for changes to the entitlement program. Heck was elected to Congress in 2010. As the ad points out, Bush’s plan to shift to a partially privatized version of Social Security would likely lead to billions of dollars in fees for the brokerages and mutual fund businesses who would oversee the new individual accounts. Heck has previously said he’s more concerned about securing retirement for individuals than ensuring the future solvency of the program. ""It’s not about making Social Security solvent,"" Heck said to the Las Vegas Sun in 2010. ""It’s about securing people’s retirement."" In 2011, Heck did join House Republicans in a vote against an amendment that would have prohibited the use of appropriated funds to cut or ""privatize"" Social Security and other entitlements. Heck campaign spokesman Brian Baluta said in an email that private investments could potentially entail anything from U.S. Treasury securities, annuities, CDs, money market funds, interest-bearing savings accounts or employer-matched retirement savings account. ""But all this is moot, because it’s a theoretical discussion about how to address the long-range insolvency of (Social Security),"" Baluta said in an email. ""There is no Joe Heck plan to privatize Social Security."" This isn’t the first time AFSCME has gone after Heck on this particular issue — the union was sharply criticized over a similar ad in 2010 by journalists including Jon Ralston, who accused the union of ""blatant fear mongering."" Our ruling A new AFSCME ad claims that Heck ""supports privatizing (Social Security), turning our savings over to Wall Street, and risking it on the stock market.""

Is Donald Trump right that Hillary Clinton once “wanted a wall” on the Mexican border?
","Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has said her party ""builds bridges not walls."" During a campaign appearance in Green Bay, Republican nominee Donald Trump said Clinton had once been in favor of a wall with Mexico. Building a wall along the 2,000-mile border between the United States and Mexico, of course, has been a central part of Trump’s campaign. He has even vowed to force the Mexican government to pay for it. But did Clinton once back a wall? Here is how Trump phrased it in his Aug. 5, 2016 rally at the KI Convention Center: ""We’re gonna have strong borders. We’re gonna have a wall -- a big, powerful wall. You know that Hillary Clinton wanted a wall, a number of years ago. She wanted a wall."" Let’s take a closer look. Secure Fence Act  To be sure, both Trump and Clinton say they support secure borders. In the 2016 campaign, Trump has said he would secure borders by building a wall. Clinton hasn’t detailed specific plans but has said she will protect U.S. borders through a combination of efforts, one being physical barriers. But this factcheck is not about Clinton’s current platform. Rather, it is about what she may have supported in the past. When asked for backup, Trump’s campaign pointed to a 2006 bill that Clinton voted for while a senator from New York. The bill -- the Secure Fence Act of 2006 -- authorized about 700 miles of fencing to be installed along the country’s southern border, along with other security measures. It was the beginning of an attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform. The original bill specifically called for double-layer fencing across 700 miles of the border. Clinton, and 25 other Democratic senators, voted in favor of the bill. It passed the Senate 80-19 and was signed into law by President George W. Bush. So, it’s fair to say she once supported a barrier along a large portion of the border. Today, 702 miles of fencing separates the United States from Mexico, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. But just 36 miles are double-layered. That’s because a 2007 amendment in the federal budget bill let the U.S. Department of Homeland Security determine what was necessary. Wall vs. fence Trump campaign adviser Stephen Miller said of Clinton: ""Her vote is self-explanatory."" Practically speaking, what’s the difference between Trump’s wall and the fence proposed in 2006? Television news anchor Jorge Ramos asked Clinton this question Jan. 11, 2016 at the Iowa Black and Brown Forum, broadcast on the Fusion network, a Hispanic news channel. ""What the difference between your idea and Donald Trump’s idea on building a wall with Mexico?,"" Ramos asked. ""So we do need to have secure borders and what that will take is a combination of technology and physical barrier,"" Clinton said. ""You want a wall then,"" Ramos interjected.   ""No, we’ve --"" she said. ""You said that."" ""Well, I voted for border security and some of it was a fence,"" Clinton said. ""I don’t think we ever called it a wall. Maybe in some places it was a wall."" Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute said the semantic differences are irrelevant. ""Whether it’s a wall or a fence, it blocks people,"" Nowrasteh said. ""Quibbling between a wall and fence -- it’s just a word game at that point."" He noted a 700-mile barrier is substantial. Indeed, it represents about one-third of the length of the border. ""Maybe it’s fair to say she doesn’t support a wall along the entirety but she certainly supported a barrier along a large portion of it,"" Nowrasteh said. Jon Feere, a legal policy analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies, agreed. The center favors reduced immigration. ""It's clear that, at one point, Clinton supported a secure border that includes physical barriers,"" Feere said. Our rating In a Green Bay speech, Trump said ""Hillary Clinton wanted a wall."" Clinton did vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. For our purposes, the differences between a wall and a fence in this claim are not significant -- both block people. But the fence Clinton backed is not nearly as expansive as the wall Trump is promoting. And in his phrasing, Trump seemed to equate the two. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate Trump’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/eb1bee6a-2961-40be-ba2f-877183cc7bc4",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3FA840>],/factchecks/2016/aug/15/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-hillary-clinton-once-wanted-wal/

Tim Kaine over-credits his father-in-law, Linwood Holton, for Va. school desegregation
","Tim Kaine has a special place on his heroes list for his father-in-law, former Virginia Gov. Linwood Holton. ""Linwood Holton, who turns 93 next month, was the Republican governor of Virginia from 1970 to 1974 who made the decision to desegregate Virginia schools,"" Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said during an Aug. 4 speech to the National Urban League. Kaine told the civil rights group that before Holton, Virginia governors had played ""all kinds of tricks"" to avoid complying with the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 that struck down public school segregation. ""But Lin decided we want to be an aristocracy of merit; everybody’s equal,"" Kaine said. ""He integrated Virginia schools."" He gave the same credit to Holton during a speech in Miami on July 23, when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton introduced Kaine as her running mate. Kaine also said Holton ""integrated Virginia’s public schools"" during his July 27 speech at the Democratic National Convention, when he accepted the vice presidential nomination. Was Holton really the force that broke Virginia’s history of school segregation? The answer, two historians and a political scientist told us, technically is ""no"" but symbolically ""yes."" ""It is inaccurate to say Linwood Holton integrated Virginia public schools,"" said Robert Pratt, a University of Georgia historian who grew up in Virginia and in 1992 wrote a book about the desegregation of Richmond schools. ""All of the desegregation that came about in Virginia came as a consequence of federal court action."" Benjamin Campbell, author of ""Richmond’s Unhealed History,"" agreed. ""The integration of schools in Virginia was court-ordered,"" he said. But Holton’s public and personal reactions to the court orders, they added, set a tone of acceptance in Virginia for a new era of integration. A brief history Let’s start with the Brown v. Board of Education decision. At that time, Virginia’s government had been dominated for 28 years by a segregationist Democratic machine led by U.S. Sen. Harry F. Byrd Sr. Rather than integrate public schools, Byrd led a movement to close them and set up publicly funded tuition grants to help white students attend private academies. The result was that some black students, most notably in Prince Edward County, were left with no schools to attend. Virginia lawmakers also created a three-person pupil placement board tasked with assigning all students in the state to schools. Black students seeking to transfer to white schools rarely received permission from the panel. Congress put pressure on Virginia and other Southern states by passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Among other things, it allowed Washington to withhold education funds to states that refused to integrate public schools. Massive Resistance and the pupil placement board gave way in the mid-1960s to a new ploy. Localities adopted ""freedom-of-choice"" plans that gave all students the right to select their schools, regardless of race. But this didn’t spur integration. Black and white parents were concerned about sending their children to schools where they would be minorities, Campbell said. In addition, the plans typically did not provide transportation for students who wanted to go to schools outside their neighborhoods. In 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the freedom-of-choice plan in New Kent County wasn’t meeting the mandate of establishing ""a unitary non-racial system of public education."" It ordered federal district courts to devise school plans for New Kent and other freedom-of-choice localities in which ""racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch."" The combination of the 1968 high court ruling and the increasingly real threat of losing federal funds spurred many school systems toward serious integration. Richmond, however, dragged its feet. Enter Holton Holton’s election in 1969 was historic. It marked the first time since the Reconstruction days of 100 years earlier that Virginia elected a Republican governor. It also ended a 44-year era in which the Byrd Machine held the state’s top office. During his inaugural address in January 1970, Holton said ""old dogmas have died"" and called for a new era of integration. ""Here in Virginia, we must see that no citizen of the commonwealth is excluded from participation in both the blessings and the responsibilities of our society because of race,"" he said. ""We will have a government based on a partnership of all Virginians, a government in which there will be neither partisanship nor prejudice of any kind. As Virginia has been a model for so much else in America, let us now endeavor to make today’s Virginia a model for race relations."" Holton’s calls for cooperation touched a special nerve in Richmond, where black parents filed suit to integrate the city’s schools. In March 1970, U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. ordered Richmond to draft a new integration plan. On Aug. 17 - just two weeks before schools opened - Merhige approved a plan for the busing of 13,000 students. In addition to Richmond, Roanoke, Lynchburg and Norfolk were under court-ordered busing plans for the new school year, sparking white flight in all of those cities. Amid the controversy, Holton and his wife, Jinks, had to make a choice. The Executive Mansion, while located in Richmond, is state property. So the Holtons could send their three children to any public school in Virginia. They chose to enroll them in the predominantly black schools that were closest to the mansion. On Aug. 31, 1970, Holton escorted his oldest daughter - 13-year-old Tayloe - into John F. Kennedy High School. The moment was memorialized by a photo that ran the next day in newspapers across the country, including just under the masthead of The New York Times. Kaine’s future wife, Anne, and her younger brother, Woody, were taken to Mosby Middle School on the first day by their mother. Experts who told us the courts integrated Virginia schools still heap praise on Holton. ""Of course, the courts ordered everything,"" Campbell said. ""But this was the first political leader in Virginia to advocate for integration. From the point of view of those of us living in the state, it was absolutely amazing. It was unheard of."" ""I have the utmost regard for Linwood Holton,"" Pratt said. ""What he did played a very important symbolic role."" Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, said, ""We had a history of governors and other officials ignoring orders on desegregation or tying them down on appeals. (Holton) obeyed the busing order, and that did result in integration."" Sabato said Holton’s political career suffered from his stand. The state ""Republican Party wouldn’t have anything to do with him after that,"" he said. In 1978, Holton sought the party’s nomination for the U.S. Senate and finished last among three candidates at the state GOP convention. We should note that Merhige also suffered consequences after ordering busing. The judge received death threats and sent his children out of the country. His dog was shot, and a guest house on his property was burned down. Our ruling Kaine often says that Holton, his father-in-law, ""integrated Virginia public schools."" He offers no qualifications and creates an inaccurate impression that Holton, as governor, ordered the opening of all state school doors to all students. The technical credit belongs to the courts, which outlawed segregated schools in 1954 and for years afterward closed loopholes fashioned by politicians in Virginia and other Southern states. Those efforts were stymied in Virginia in 1970 by court-ordered busing. Holton’s symbolic efforts, however, can’t be dismissed. Unlike Virginia governors before him, he embraced integration. Unlike his predecessors, he didn’t contest court orders. And in a small but significant way, it can be said that he helped to integrate Virginia schools by enrolling his three children in predominantly black schools. So on the whole, we rate Kaine’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097234800>],/factchecks/2016/aug/15/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-over-credits-his-father-law-linwood-holt/

Abbott exaggerates COVID-19 concerns about migrants entering US
","One day after Gov. Greg Abbott announced he would lift the statewide mask mandate and allow all businesses to open to 100% capacity, the governor turned his attention to the coronavirus spreading along the Texas-Mexico border.  ""The Biden Administration is recklessly releasing hundreds of illegal immigrants who have COVID into Texas communities,"" the governor said in a March 3 tweet. ""The Biden Admin. must IMMEDIATELY end this callous act that exposes Texans & Americans to COVID.""  According to a March 2 NBC News article, 108 asylum seekers in Brownsville had tested positive for COVID-19 by rapid testing while waiting to board busses destined for other U.S. cities. The city of Brownsville conducts these tests on migrants after they are released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. As of March 2, the 108 positive cases represented about 6% of all tests the city had been administered since the city began testing on Jan. 25. While the city can refer infected migrants to non-governmental organizations for quarantining, it does not have the authority to stop people from traveling throughout the country.  The NBC News article was picked up by Fox News and the New York Post the next day and prompted Abbott's March 3 tweet about COVID-positive migrants endangering Texas communities. Abbott continued this line of attack in the subsequent days, first during a TV interview with KPRC-TV in Houston, then in an interview with CNBC, and again in another tweet in which he said the state denied the federal government’s request for help in screening, testing and quarantining migrants.  ""The unconscionable act by the Biden Administration of releasing COVID-positive illegal immigrants in our state puts the lives of Texans and Americans at risk,"" he tweeted. ""Border security is strictly a federal responsibility."" In a Tuesday news conference at the border, Abbott urged the Biden administration to increase U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement funding, which is responsible for testing and detaining anyone crossing the border. A negative coronavirus test is required by the federal government before entry to the U.S. While U.S. Customs and Border Protection conducts screenings, ""suspected COVID-19 cases are referred to local health systems for appropriate testing, diagnosis, and treatment,"" the agency said in a statement.   Felipe Romero, a spokesperson for the city of Brownsville, confirmed that the city was rapid testing each person Border Patrol dropped off at the city’s bus terminal. The 108 positive cases reported by NBC News on March 2 had climbed to 204 Tuesday, or about 12% of the total number of people tested.   Romero said that there are two categories of migrants who are being released to the city’s bus terminal: asylum seekers entering after the repeal of the Trump administration’s Remain in Mexico policy, and those who have been apprehended at the border and allowed to remain in the country pending immigration court hearings, a policy derogatorily described by critics as ""catch and release.""  Let’s look closely at each category to determine the accuracy of Abbott’s tweet.   In February, the Biden administration announced that it was dismantling many of the immigration policies put in place by former President Donald Trump. The first phase of reform began by processing the 25,000 asylum seekers who had been forced to remain in Mexico under Trump’s Migrant Protection Protocols.  On Feb. 19, federal authorities began processing up to 300 people per day at three different border crossings — two in Texas, in Brownsville and El Paso, and one in California, according to the Associated Press.   Because Abbott’s statement focuses on the release of ""hundreds of illegal immigrants"" in Texas, this fact-check focuses on the crossings in Brownsville and El Paso. While the city of Brownsville reported 108 positive cases among migrants released by Border Patrol, the city of El Paso said that zero positive cases have been identified through its rapid testing program. El Paso’s tests are being supplied by the city and administered by non-governmental organizations, a city spokesperson said.  The second major policy shift releasing migrants in Texas communities is the reintroduction of the Obama-era policy that allows asylum seekers to remain in the U.S. while awaiting court dates. That policy was suspended by the Trump administration in 2018. The revived policy allows some families who are apprehended by Border Patrol to be released in the U.S. as they await their asylum proceedings. However, not all apprehended migrants are awarded this privilege; many are expelled to their origin countries.   While asylum seekers formerly held under the remain in Mexico policy are processed in specific communities, those who are released under the revived Obama-era policy could be released anywhere along the border. However, the number of tests administered to people released under this policy is unknown and, according to Border Report, there are concerns that not all are being tested before they travel elsewhere in the U.S. to await court dates.   It’s unclear what actual numbers form the basis of Abbott’s claim that ""hundreds of illegal immigrants"" carrying COVID-19 are being released in Texas. A spokesperson referred us to the 108 migrants in Brownsville reported by NBC News and did not respond to questions asking how Abbott arrived at his estimation of ""hundreds.""   Abbott’s statement mischaracterizes the status of migrants who are being released into U.S. communities by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.  ""Illegal immigrants"" are migrants who have entered the country without legal permission. All of the migrants being released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, on the other hand, have applied for asylum and have a legal claim to remain in the U.S. while they await their asylum proceedings. Using the two terms interchangeably is inaccurate, said Andrea Meza, director of family detention services for Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES.  ""These folks are asylum seekers, so criminalizing them based on their manner of entry, which is not related to their legal ability to seek asylum, is misleading,"" Meza said.  Abbott said that the Biden administration is releasing ""hundreds of illegal immigrants"" infected with COVID-19 into Texas communities.   A spokesperson said that the claim was based on news articles reporting that 108 migrants released by Border Patrol had tested positive in Brownsville. While that number has risen beyond 200 positive cases since then, it was well below ""hundreds"" at the time of Abbott’s tweet.   Abbott also mischaracterizes the status of the migrants being released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection by calling them ""illegal immigrants."" They are asylum seekers holding notices to appear in court.

There’s no scientific evidence to support that these supplements can kill the coronavirus
","A post that’s being shared widely on Instagram discourages people from getting a COVID-19 vaccine and instead advocates for ""naturopathic solutions.""  A man speaking in a video clip in the post mentions vitamin D, vitamin C ""and everything else from colloidal silver to the black seed oil — there are so many things that are killing this virus."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In May 2020, Glenn Grothman, a Republican congressman from Wisconsin, said that research illustrated a correlation between vitamin D deficiencies and higher COVID-19 mortality rates. We rated that True. And what’s more: early studies suggested that vitamin D could possibly curb the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and reduce mortality rates.  But the latest research isn’t so hopeful on that front. A study from McGill University in Canada found no evidence that vitamin D supplements could improve coronavirus outcomes, Business Insider reported on March 10.  And unlike earlier research into vitamin D deficiencies, another study from Aristotle University in Greece found no correlation between such deficiencies and higher mortality rates.  Neither of these new studies has been peer-reviewed but as The Guardian noted, they reached the same conclusion: ""evidence for a direct link between vitamin D deficiency and Covid outcomes is lacking."" In December, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England published a rapid review of recent studies on vitamin D and COVID-19. Its conclusion: sufficient evidence to support using vitamin D supplements to prevent or treat COVID-19 is still lacking and should be further investigated, according to The Lancet. Back in January 2020, we rated False a claim that the coronavirus could be slowed or stopped with the ""immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C"" because there was no evidence that the supplement has any effect on the COVID-19. According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, that’s still true today. In its COVID-19 treatment guidelines, last updated in November 2020, the National Institutes of Health notes that there is insufficient data to ""recommend either for or against the use of vitamin C"" for treating both critically ill and non-critically ill COVID-19 patients. Vitamin C is believed to benefit patients with severe and critical illnesses, according to the National Institutes of Health, but there have been no completed controlled trials of vitamin C in COVID-19 patients and ""the available observational data are sparse and inconclusive."" Colloidal silver — a liquid that contains silver particles — is often billed as a cure for disease, but there isn’t scientific evidence to back that up. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said that it’s not safe or effective for treating any disease or condition, and the agency has issued warning letters to companies selling the product as a treatment or prevention for COVID-19. People selling black seed oil — extracted from Nigella sativa, or black cumin seeds — as a COVID-19 treatment have also come under federal scrutiny. In a May warning letter to a company encouraging consumers to fight the coronavirus with black seed oil, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission wrote that no reliable scientific evidence supported claims that black seed oil can prevent or treat COVID-19.   The FDA has sent similar warning letters to companies selling black seed oil to treat or prevent COVID-19 as recently as September.  The Journal of Pharmacopuncture, which is focused in part on alternative medicines, published an article in June on Nigella sativa as a ""potential herb for COVID-19,"" but its conclusion was far from the claim in the Instagram post, saying that such a supplement ""may reduce the adverse effects of conventional medicines"" but that randomized controlled trials were needed to determine any benefits in treating COVID-19 patients. A post on Instagram discourages people from getting a COVID-19 vaccine and instead advocates for ""naturopathic solutions,"" including vitamins D and C, colloidal silver and black seed oil. While research into some supplements like vitamin D has seemed promising, subsequent studies have questioned whether it can protect against COVID-19. And there’s no reliable scientific evidence to support the idea that vitamin D, vitamin C, colloidal silver or black seed oil can kill the coronavirus, as this post claims.

Did Charles Schumer and Nancy Pelosi sneak money into the COVID-19 relief bill?
","Once President Joe Biden signs the American Rescue Plan Act, more than $350 billion will start to flow to state, tribal and local governments. Democrats hail the massive infusion of cash as a much needed tonic to heal the broad damage of the pandemic. Republicans have opposed it at every turn. The conservative website Trending Politics tied that particular funding stream — which is going to local governments across the country — to the machinations of the top two congressional Democrats. The site’s headline called it ""pure corruption."" ""Schumer and Pelosi sneak funding into COVID bill to save them from their own failures,"" the March 8 article said. ""The new stimulus package will be erasing San Francisco’s projected $650 million deficit which grew as a result to (sic) Democrats’, specifically Nancy Pelosi’s, poor management. The package will also be erasing Chuck Schumer’s deficit in New York."" It’s a stretch to blame two federal elected officials for the financial woes of their home district or state. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t the mayor of San Francisco, nor is Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer the governor of New York.  But beyond that, the article’s first flaw is that there was nothing secret about this effort. Aid to states and localities was the single biggest item that Democrats wanted and that Republicans rejected. Democrats clamored for it in the December COVID-19 relief bill, but with Republicans running the Senate, and then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell firmly opposed, the idea was crushed. After the Senate switched hands, the $350 billion was back in play. The measure promised $220 billion for states, territories and tribal governments, and $130 billion for cities and counties in order ""to mitigate the fiscal effects stemming from the public health emergency.""  State and local leaders can spend the money pretty much any way they like, except for two things: It can’t go to fund pension plans, and it can’t be used to pay for tax cuts. Both San Francisco and New York state faced budget gaps. San Francisco expected a shortfall of $411 million (not the $650 million in the web article) and for New York, the amount was $15.1 billion. Without aid, both jurisdictions warned of service cuts and tax hikes. The new bill has $464 million for San Francisco and $12.6 billion for New York. That would more than fill the hole in San Francisco, and largely fill the one that New York projected. What the Trending Politics piece never mentions is that thanks to the formulas that drive how the money gets divvied up, Republicans also do well under the bill. Those formulas use a mix of unemployment rates, population, poverty and housing factors to set each state’s and locality’s allocation. We might not know how the money will be spent, but there’s little mystery about where its first stop will be after it leaves Washington. The House Government Oversight Committee has a spreadsheet with all the allocation details. The article singled out New York and the $12.6 billion the state government will get. But it could just have easily noted the $16.7 billion headed to Texas, home to Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Florida, with its Republican governor and two Republican senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott is due to get $10.2 billion. (All totals rise if funds to counties, cities and tribal governments are folded in.) Pelosi was called out for the money going to San Francisco — about $464 million — but Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s California district will also benefit. About $270 million is headed to the city of Bakersfield and to Kern County. Part of his district sits in Los Angeles, which is due to get about $1.9 billion. And like Pelosi’s, McCarthy’s constituents will gain from the $26 billion going to the state of California. In the overall tally, Democratic-led states do better. About $190 billion goes to states with Democratic governors and $143 billion goes to states headed by Republicans. That’s due as much to demographics as politics. Republicans predominate among states that have smaller populations. If money follows people, more of it will flow to blue states. Funding pensions and paying for tax cuts are the only two big limits on the federal dollars. But money is money. If a state repairs a bridge with pandemic relief funds, it will free up money for other purposes — for example, funding pensions. The bill includes penalties for that. ""In theory, if money is used to shore up pension funds, or directly or indirectly funds a tax cut, then the Treasury Department could come back and make the state refund some money,"" said Kim Reuben, director of the state and local finance initiative at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a Washington policy group. In practice, Reuben said, the connection between federal dollars and state and local finances might not be obvious. The state and local officials she talks to hope the Treasury Department makes things clear quickly. ""Governments are excited to get the money, but they are nervous about what Washington will say that might disqualify the money for the uses they have in mind,"" Reuben said. The bill’s intent, Reuben said, is for state and local leaders to spend the money on what they couldn’t otherwise afford. There could be considerable debate over how well state and local governments stick to that goal. Trending Politics said Schumer and Pelosi snuck money into the COVID-19 relief bill to solve their own problems back home.  The bill sends billions to New York and millions to San Francisco. But that was never any secret. The legislation has $350 billion for state, tribal and local governments, and Republicans have vigorously opposed that for many months. The Trending Politics article failed to mention the billions flowing to Republican-led states and congressional districts.

Cartoon misleads about voter eligibility under HR 1
","A cartoon making the rounds on Facebook portrays a federal voting rights bill as opening the door to voter fraud. The cartoon shows a man telling an election worker: ""I’m 16, I’m here illegally, I have no ID and I haven’t registered to vote."" The election worker replies: ""Here’s your ballot."" A sign in the background says: ""HR 1 for election fraud act."" The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Editorial cartoons may be funny, but if they convey a factual message, we hold them to a standard of accuracy, just as we do with other forms of political commentary.  The cartoon on voting was drawn by Gary Varvel, a conservative syndicated cartoonist. Varvel did not respond to a request for comment.  The implication of the cartoon is that H.R. 1, a Democratic-backed bill moving through Congress, would allow minors and immigrants in the U.S. illegally to vote. That’s inaccurate. The cartoon’s implications about voter ID and same-day registration, meanwhile, leave out important context and could create misunderstanding about the bill’s provisions. H.R. 1, known as the For the People Act, combines proposals for voter registration, absentee voting, in-person voting, campaign finance and ethics related to federal elections. The Democratic-led House passed the bill March 3 largely, along party lines. The Senate is expected to take up the bill this month. The bill says that states must accept an application to register to vote from anyone who is at least 16 years old. This process is known as ""preregistration"" and is already allowed in some states for people who are 16 or 17, so they can begin voting at age 18. Some states also permit 17-year-olds to vote in primary elections, if they will turn 18 before the general election.  However, H.R. 1 states that the bill has ""no effect on state voting age requirements,"" and that nothing in the preregistration provision ""may be construed to require a state to permit an individual who is under 18 years of age at the time of an election for federal office to vote in the election."" The House rejected a proposed amendment to lower the voting age to 16. The bill does not permit voting by noncitizens in U.S. elections, whether they’re in the country legally or not.  A provision in the bill would facilitate automatic voter registration for people using services at government agencies. But that section says government agencies would pass along a person’s information for voter registration only if they are citizens. People would still have to attest that they are eligible to vote, with penalties for lying, and it would still be up to election officials to verify their eligibility.  There are several mentions in the bill of the goal to register ""eligible citizens."" The legislation doesn’t ban state voter ID requirements, but it does include a workaround for voters that already exists in some states.  The bill says that if a state requires voters to present an ID to cast a ballot, it must allow a voter, as an alternative, to present election officials a sworn written statement attesting to their identity and eligibility to vote. ""This is actually a common practice used in several states, and since the vast majority of voters have identification and carry it with them, it is rarely used,"" David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, previously told PolitiFact. ""But this alternative can be important for those few eligible voters that might have difficulty meeting restrictive identification requirements.""  The bill would mandate that states allow any eligible person to register to vote on the day of a federal election and cast a ballot, or to revise their registration information on Election Day. The National Conference of State Legislatures found that as of October, 21 states plus the District of Columbia already allowed same-day registration. The sign in the cartoon calls H.R. 1 the ""for election fraud act"" — implying that it would lead to fraud. We can’t fact-check a prediction, but there are several provisions in the bill that discourage fraud, including grants to states to improve the security of their voting systems and audits of voting systems.  The bill requires information sharing from the federal government to the states about security, including cybersecurity threats. It directs the director of national intelligence to submit an assessment of threats posed by state actors and terrorist groups to chief state election officials and congressional committees. It also creates a bounty program to reward individuals, organizations and companies that report previously unidentified security vulnerabilities. The Bipartisan Policy Center said many of the provisions would make progress toward ensuring election security, but said that the legislation still falls short in this area. ""Congress must authorize regularized funding for election security, aimed at repelling foreign intrusion into the voting process,"" the center wrote. ""That includes mandating a way to get future funding into the hands of local election officials who are most responsible for the voting infrastructure."" A cartoon on Facebook said that under H.R. 1, a person can still vote if they are 16, in the U.S. illegally, have no ID and have not registered to vote. The cartoon is wrong on the first two points: The legislation would allow 16-year-olds to preregister, but not cast ballots, and only eligible citizens can vote. It leaves out important context on the other two points. The legislation would allow a process for a voter without ID to present a sworn statement instead, and it would allow same-day registration. Many states already have these provisions. The overall message of the cartoon is that H.R. 1 opens the door to fraud and allowing ineligible people to vote. It ignores the security provisions and eligibility checks in the bill. We rate this statement Mostly False.  RELATED: Fact-checking misleading attacks on the HR 1 voting rights bill RELATED: No, HR 1 would not allow the Boston Marathon bomber to vote from prison RELATED: Fact-checking misleading attacks on HR 1, Democrats’ voting rights bill RELATED: No, HR 1 doesn't 'allow minors to vote'",[<zip object at 0x00000280979FBE00>],/factchecks/2021/mar/10/facebook-posts/cartoon-misleads-about-voter-eligibility-under-hr-/

The Air Force introduced maternity flight duty uniforms before Biden took office
","A blog post shared on social media casts President Joe Biden as the man behind an unbelievable plot: sending pregnant women into battle.  ""NOT A GAFFE,"" the headline says. ""Biden is making ‘maternity flight suits’ so pregnant women can fight in the military.""  The post, which cites remarks Biden made on March 8 — International Women’s Day — says that ""Biden announced that under him, the United States military would be making ‘maternity flight suits’ for pregnant women.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On International Women’s Day, Biden gave a speech in which he talked about making it easier and safer for more women to join and stay in the military. He said that women in the military know there’s more work to be done to ensure their leadership is recognized and that all women feel safe and respected. ""Some of it is relatively straightforward work where we’re making good progress designing body armor that fits women properly,"" Biden said, ""tailoring combat uniforms for women, creating maternity flight suits, updating requirements for their hairstyles.""  But maternity flight suits are not new, and they weren’t introduced under the Biden administration, as this blog post suggests. In September 2019 — when Donald Trump was president — the U.S. Air Force updated its policies to ""reduce barriers on pregnant aviators who perform flight duties and have uncomplicated pregnancies,"" according to a statement from the military branch. ""This update allows many women to keep performing flight duties during their pregnancy, maintain currency, and prevent postpartum requalification training."" About a year later, the Air Force announced it was seeking pregnant service members to participate in a ""maternity flight duty uniform fit and wear"" test as part of that effort. The statement quotes 1st Lt. Avery Thomson, a lead program manager for maternity development in the Air Force Uniform Office, as saying that the effort was important for the approximately 400 pregnant airmen each year who had previously been modifying their flight duty uniforms ""at a significant personal financial cost"" or ""borrowing bigger uniforms from their husbands, which creates a safety of flight issue.""  Air Force Magazine reported at the time that the new uniforms were among the steps the Air Force was taking to help ""encourage more women to pursue rated careers and not force them to choose between becoming aviators and mothers."" Pilot, combat systems officer, air battle manager and remotely piloted aircraft pilot are the four so-called ""rated career"" fields in the Air Force. Non-rated positions include work in intelligence, maintenance and engineering. A senior master sergeant who inspired the uniform initiative said in a September 2020 press release from the Air Force that finding a properly fitting maternity uniform when she was pregnant in 2018 and 2019 was problematic. ""I was a new superintendent of a very large squadron, and five of our Airmen were pregnant at the same time, including myself,"" said the senior master sergeant, who was identified only as Genevieve for security reasons. ""Every one of us had numerous challenges accessing maternity uniform items."" Our ruling The blog post claims that Biden is making ""maternity flight suits"" so pregnant women can fight in the military.  The Air Force has been working on making ""maternity flight duty uniforms"" available to its service members, an initiative that started during the Trump administration after airmen struggled to find uniforms that fit during their pregnancies.  According to the Air Force, it’s part of an effort to level the playing field for women and men serving in that branch of the military, and it allows women to keep performing their flight duties during pregnancy.  This is not a new initiative so that Biden can dispatch pregnant women to fight.    We rate this blog post Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979CFF40>],/factchecks/2021/mar/10/blog-posting/air-force-introduced-maternity-flight-duty-uniform/

Does California Have ‘One Of The Lowest’ Covid-19 Death Rates In The Nation As Gov. Newsom Claimed?
","Speaking in the heart of Los Angeles, a place with one of the highest COVID-19 death rates in the country, Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed during his State of the State Address yesterday that California’s overall mortality rate was one of the lowest during the pandemic.  ""California’s death rate has remained one of the lowest per capita in the nation: 134 deaths per 100,000, compared to 158 nationally, 153 in Texas and 247 in New York,"" Newsom said during his speech at Dodger Stadium on March 9, 2021.  That characterization, as we’ll explore, appears to be an exaggeration. Daniel Lopez, a spokesman for the governor, said Newsom’s statement about ""one of the lowest"" death rates is accurate ""when you compare California among states with a population greater than 10 million. ""Based on this comparison California is only behind North Carolina which has [a] population of approximately 10.5 million,"" Lopez added.  That’s correct. But Newsom made a more sweeping statement in his speech and did not offer clarification. A moment earlier, Newsom accurately noted the number of empty stadium seats behind him were about the same as the 54,395 Californians who had lost their lives to the virus over the past year. The number had increased by more than 300 less than a day after Newsom’s speech.  The overall total is the most of any state in the nation. That grim ranking is not necessarily surprising as California has a higher population than any other state. For this fact check, however, we wanted to know whether Newsom got it right when he claimed California’s per capita death rate remained ""one of the lowest"" in the country.  From Early Success To Middle Of The Pack Early in the pandemic, California was praised for its relatively low mortality rate compared with other populous states. As Vox noted in mid April 2020, New York had ""14 times as many coronavirus deaths as California,"" despite California being among the first states to report COVID-19 cases. Within months, however, as Californians stopped staying home and restrictions eased, a summer surge of coronavirus cases and deaths hit the Golden State.  ""Death rates change over time,"" Lee Riley, professor and chair of infectious disease and vaccinology at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health told us in an email. ""So, [assessing how California has fared] really depends on when you look at the data."" Looking at the data now, Newsom got the numbers mostly right.  California’s per capita mortality rate was 137 per 100,000 people on the day of Newsom’s speech, according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention.  That ratio is lower than the national average of 158 per 100,000, and better than per capita rates in Texas (153 deaths per 100,000 people) and New York (245 deaths per 100,000 people), as the governor claimed.  But to characterize California’s rate as ""one of the lowest"" in the nation is a stretch. The 137 deaths per 100,000 puts it in the middle of the pack, or 23rd lowest out of 50 states, the CDC data shows.  In early February, California’s overall ranking was better at 18th lowest, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis. ""Being in the middle of the pack in the United States is nothing to boast about,"" added John Swartzberg, an infectious disease expert and professor emeritus at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health. ""The US's performance by almost all metrics (including deaths) is one of the worst in the world."" Currently, some individual counties such as Los Angeles and Imperial continue to have a much higher death rate than the nation’s average.  Los Angeles was at 201 deaths per 100,000 this week. The rate is much higher for the county’s Latino population, at 321 deaths per 100,000, according to county data.  ""Only 6 states reported higher rates,"" than Los Angeles County’s rate, Riley noted in his email. Those are New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Mississippi. Los Angeles County was among the hardest hit in the country in December and January as post-holiday coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths overwhelmed hospitals. Our Ruling Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed California’s per capita COVID-19 death rate remained ""one of the lowest"" in the nation, lower than the national average and rates in Texas and New York.  CDC data place California’s mortality rate at 137 deaths per 100,000. That’s lower than the national average of 158 deaths per 100,000 and better than rates in Texas and New York. But there are 22 other states with a lower death rate than California, meaning the state is closer to the middle than the low end.  A spokesperson for Newsom said the governor’s claim is accurate when looking at states with more than 10 million people, but Newsom made no such clarification in his speech. At one point early in the pandemic, California was praised for having a relatively low death rate. But much has changed in a year, including major summer and winter coronavirus surges in the state.  Newsom got some of this right, but then stretched the truth when he characterized California’s rate as ""one of the lowest"" in the nation.  We rate his statement Half True.

No, HR 1 doesn't 'allow minors to vote'
","A North Carolina congressman says he opposes the Democrats’ voting rights bill in part because it lowers the voting age. House Democrats introduced H.R. 1, also known as the For the People Act, to expand access to the voting booth. On March 2, U.S. Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) tweeted a list of ways he says the bill ""rigs"" elections to help Democrats. He said that it: ""Eliminates voter ID,  Allows felons to vote,  Allows minors to vote,  Expands ‘no excuse’ absentee voting."" We’ve looked at some of these claims before. Eliminates voter ID: This is partially accurate. The bill doesn’t eliminate state voter ID laws so much as provide voters a way to work around them. In states with voter ID laws, the bill says voters without ID can present election officials with a sworn written statement under penalty of perjury attesting to their identity. Allows felons to vote: This leaves out context. It’s more accurate to say the bill restores voting rights to felons once they’ve served their criminal sentence. Many states already allow felons to vote once they meet the terms of their sentence, as PolitiFact has previously reported. The bill specifically says rights are restored ""unless such individual is serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution or facility at the time of the election."" Expands ""no excuse"" absentee voting: This is true. Some states require voters to have an excuse for requesting an absentee ballot. The bill says if someone is eligible to vote, ""the State may not impose any additional conditions or requirements on the eligibility of the individual to cast the vote in such election by absentee ballot by mail."" It’s worth noting, however, that North Carolina is already a no excuse absentee voting state. Now to the big miss. Budd said the bill ""allows minors to vote."" That’s not true. When we asked Budd’s office about this, spokesman Curtis Kalin said: ""I believe he was referring to the provision that allowed those under 18 to register to vote."" The bill allows people who are 16-years-old to pre-register to vote. As PolitiFact previously reported, some states already allow this practice. Under section 1094, the bill even says the pre-registration has ""no effect on state voting age requirements."" ""Nothing in paragraph (1) may be construed to require a State to permit an individual who is under 18 years of age at the time of an election for Federal office to vote in the election,"" the bill reads. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass, has introduced a pair of amendments that would lower the voting age to 16. Polls show younger voters tend to lean Democratic. Pressley’s amendments failed in both 2019 and 2021 with more than 300 House members voting against the idea each time. Budd tweeted, among other things, that H.R. 1 ""allows minors to vote."" The bill would allow people who are 16 to register to vote. That’s not the same thing as allowing them to cast a vote. This claim is patently False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280FFB5B280>],/factchecks/2021/mar/10/ted-budd/no-hr-1-doesnt-allow-minors-vote/

Net worth is the value of a person’s assets — such as cash, home, stocks, bonds and other property — minus any debts owed. Members of Congress are required to file financial disclosure reports listing their assets, liabilities and income sources outside of their congressional salary. Ranges, rather than specific amounts, must be disclosed. Ocasio-Cortez has filed two financial disclosure reports with the House. Both show little or no net worth. Ocasio-Cortez’s first financial disclosure report, filed May 15, 2019, covered Jan. 1, 2017, through Dec. 31, 2018. It showed assets totaling between $3,003 and $45,000. Specifically, between $1,001 and $15,000 in each of three accounts — a checking account, a brokerage account and a 401(k) plan. For liabilities, the report showed student loan debt of between $15,001 and $50,000. In other words, it’s possible her liabilities exceeded her assets. The report also showed salary and wages from her campaign and a restaurant totaling $25,463 in 2018. Ocasio-Cortez filed her second report on Sept. 12, 2020, which covered 2019. It listed the same three accounts for assets, but totaling less — between $2,003 and $31,000 — with her student debt remaining between $15,001 and $50,000.

Ocasio-Cortez’s assets total no more than $31,000, according to her latest financial disclosure report.

Blunt’s proposal to reopen schools relied on withholding funds to force compliance
","Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri took to Twitter to express his frustration with Senate Democrats who voted against his budget amendment last month. The amendment sought to reopen in-person schooling after the coronavirus pandemic shuttered it last year. ""I recently offered an amendment to the budget bill that would have helped get kids back in school after teachers were vaccinated,"" the Feb. 25 tweet read. ""Every single Senate Democrat voted against it."" The reason they voted against it, he said, was political. ""It's very clear this isn’t about safety or science. It’s pure politics & kids are paying the price,"" the tweet read. Blunt joined South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott on the budget amendment. The congressional record shows that Democrats uniformly panned it.  Blunt’s tweet doesn’t say whether Democrats had another plan to help schools. They did. So, what was in the proposal that made so many Democrats say no? Was it pure politics?  The answer may lie in the carrot versus the stick.   Blunt’s amendment centered on penalties rather than straight aid that Democrats proposed. His proposal would have allowed Congress to limit or withhold COVID-19-related emergency relief to K-12 schools that did not reopen for in-person learning after their teachers received vaccinations. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the assistant majority leader, said Democrats voted against it because they objected to a punitive approach. ""This amendment would’ve prohibited schools from getting critical resources to implement public health protocols,"" Murray’s office said in a statement to PolitiFact Missouri. ""And as a result, this amendment would’ve made it that much harder for schools to re-open for in-person instruction. The best way to ensure our schools can safely reopen as soon as possible is to get schools the resources they need, not to impose one-size-fits-all mandates from Washington on them."" Murray’s team also said that vaccines are just one piece of safely returning to in-person learning. ""Safely reopening schools also means providing schools with the resources they need to implement public health protocols including effective physical distancing, consistent mask-wearing, ventilation, COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and more,"" the statement said. The bill passed by the Senate last week included those resources in the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill. The bill allocates $128 billion for primary and secondary schools, including money to support remedial instruction over time. Just 5% of the money for local schools comes in fiscal year 2021. Blunt’s team pointed us to his most recent remarks on the matter. In these remarks, Blunt emphasized the importance of getting kids back in school. Blunt said that he ""offered an amendment to the budget bill that would have helped get kids back in school after teachers were vaccinated"" and that ""every single Senate Democrat voted against it."" This leaves out an important detail: The amendment threatened to withhold relief funding from schools that didn’t reopen in-person learning.  Blunt framed Democrats’ opposition to his amendment in narrow terms, making it appear as though they opposed getting kids back in school when they really opposed his punitive approach. The COVID-19 relief bill that Democrats passed included funding to help schools.

No, the price of gas isn’t up 50 cents, price of food isn’t up 10% under Biden
","Are President Joe Biden’s executive orders so powerful that, in the less than two months he’s held office, they have spiked the price of gasoline by 50 cents and the price of food by 10%? That’s the claim of a post widely shared by musician Ted Nugent and others on Facebook.  It says: ""When executive orders cause gas to go up 50 cents a gallon and food costs to increase 10%, you just taxed the middle class.""      The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biden began issuing executive orders on Jan. 20, the day of his inauguration. The claim we’re checking was posted March 7. Let’s see what’s happened in between. Since bottoming out at $1.87 a gallon in late April 2020, gas prices have mostly been going up. The bulk of the increase came under President Donald Trump, with prices continuing to rise under Biden.  Nationally, the average price of a gallon of gas was $2.46 on Jan. 18, the final weekly tally before Biden took office. It rose to $2.80 on March 1, the latest weekly tally before the Facebook post, according to the U.S. Energy Administration. That’s an increase of 34 cents under Biden. The prices were similar at GasBuddy.com: $2.41 on Jan. 19 and $2.77 on March 7 — an increase of 36 cents. Some critics have said that Biden’s cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline with one executive order would quickly result in higher gasoline prices. But we previously found that, for several reasons, that’s not the case. For starters, the pipeline wasn’t operating yet, so canceling it didn’t change the balance of supply and demand.  In the same executive order, Biden placed a moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. But Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy.com, said that action has not affected current gas prices either, because current oil supplies are not affected. The order could, however, have an impact on gas prices in a few years, he said. In general, a president has limited control over the weekly and monthly shifts in gasoline prices. Gas prices depend mostly on global supply and demand.  The OPEC oil cartel and Russia have made voluntary production cuts, which has the effect of raising prices. A greater impact has been made on prices by demand, as a result of the slow but steady economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. We find no evidence that food prices have risen 10%. The price of ""food at home"" (purchased from grocery stores or other food stores) rose 0.3% in February 2021 after dropping 0.1% in January, according to the latest figures from the federal government’s Consumer Price Index, released March 10. The price was 3.5% higher in February 2021 than it was over the previous 12 months. It’s not clear what Biden executive orders the post is suggesting could have affected food prices. An executive order signed Jan. 22 asked the Department of Agriculture to consider expanding and extending federal nutrition assistance programs. ""It's hard to see which orders would have had any impact on food prices,"" said economics and law professor Alan Auerbach, director of the Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance at the University of California, Berkeley. A Facebook post claims that Biden executive orders caused price increases of 50 cents per gallon in gas and 10% in food in the less than two months since he took office. The average price of gas is about 34 cents per gallon higher since Biden took office, not 50 cents.

No, schools aren’t banning Seuss books
","A transphobic post being shared on social media uses an image of Rachel Levine, a transgender woman President Joe Biden tapped to be assistant secretary of health, to spread false information about Dr. Seuss books. ""Schools banning Dr. Seuss books,"" the post says, ""but teaching our children that this is normal.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Since Dr. Seuss Enterprises announced on March 2 that it would stop publishing and licensing six Dr. Seuss books that have been criticized for how they depict Black and Asian people, misinformation about so-called ""cancel culture"" has spread online.  President Joe Biden had nothing to do with the decision, as some people have claimed. We also didn’t find evidence of schools banning books by the children’s author, as this Facebook post claims.  Dr. Seuss Enterprises announced that it made the decision last year to stop publishing and licensing six books — ""And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,"" ""If I Ran the Zoo,"" ""McElligot’s Pool,"" ""On Beyond Zebra!,"" ""Scrambled Eggs Super!"" and ""The Cat’s Quizzer"" — after consulting with a panel of experts that included educators. About three dozen other Seuss titles, such as ""The Cat in the Hat,"" ""Green Eggs and Ham,"" and ""The Lorax,"" are not being pulled from the market. The day that Dr. Seuss Enterprises made its announcement was also the author’s birthday and National Read Across America Day, which was established by the National Education Association in 1998 to encourage children and teenagers to read. Schools nationwide have held read-aloud events featuring Dr. Seuss books and characters, but in 2017, NEA said it would start refocusing its literacy program on more diverse children’s books.  ""Kids need books that are as diverse and complex as the society in which we live,"" an NEA spokesperson told PolitiFact. The post that’s being shared on social media doesn’t identify which schools are supposedly banning Dr. Seuss. But one school district dominated search results when we went looking for evidence: Loudoun County Public Schools in Virginia, which was the subject of recent headlines about canceling Dr. Seuss. The Loudoun district has followed the NEA’s lead and advised schools not to tie Read Across America Day to Dr. Seuss’ birthday, according to the school district.  However, contrary to social media posts and some reports, ""Dr. Seuss books have not been banned in Loudoun County Schools,"" the district said in a statement.  ""Research in recent years has revealed strong racial undertones in many books written/illustrated by Dr. Seuss,"" the statement said. ""Examples include anti-Japanese American political cartoons and cartoons depicting African Americans for sale captioned with offensive language. Given this research, and LCPS’ focus on equity and culturally responsive instruction, LCPS provided this guidance to schools during the past couple of years to not connect Read Across America Day exclusively with Dr. Seuss’ birthday."" Still, Dr. Seuss books ""are available to students in our libraries and classrooms,"" the statement said. Loudoun County Public Schools hasn’t banned Dr. Seuss books, and we didn’t find evidence that other schools have either. We rate this Facebook post False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4C2F40>],/factchecks/2021/mar/10/viral-image/no-schools-arent-banning-seuss-books/

Yes, Democrats voted to send stimulus checks to prisoners, as Republicans did last year
","In the long hours of debate before Senate Democrats passed their sweeping COVID-19 relief package, Republicans offered amendments designed to put Democrats on record on very particular policy points. Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Bill Cassidy, R-La., put forward one that would prevent $1,400 stimulus checks from going to prisoners. The amendment failed on a party-line vote. Cotton tweeted that this was another example of spending tucked in the bill that had nothing to do with pandemic. ""Senate Democrats just voted to give stimulus checks to criminals in prison,"" he tweeted March 6. ""They haven’t lost their jobs, they aren’t worried about paying rent or buying groceries."" Senate Democrats just voted to give stimulus checks to criminals in prison. They haven’t lost their jobs, they aren’t worried about paying rent or buying groceries. Another example of the unrelated spending in the Democrats’ partisan slush fund. Cotton repeated his point March 8 on Fox News, saying ""every single Democrat"" wanted to send checks to prisoners — invoking Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Charleston, S.C., church shooter Dylann Roof. The record shows that Democrats rejected the amendment to prevent payments to prisoners. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said it would harm prisoners’ families. ""Given the stark racial disparities in our criminal justice system, this would cause the most harm to Black and brown families and communities already harmed by mass incarceration,"" Durbin said on the Senate floor. ""Children should not be forced to go hungry because a parent is incarcerated."" Prisoners qualify for stimulus payments because of broad eligibility requirements in this relief bill — and others. Prisoners must be a citizen or legal resident, and either need to have filed a tax return, possibly as part of a joint filing, or complete an Internal Revenue Service form requesting payment.  It’s worth noting that the two previous rounds of stimulus checks during the Trump administration — in the CARES Act in March, and the supplemental package in December — allowed prisoners to receive checks, too. Cotton voted for both of those bills. His press secretary James Arnold said circumstances were different. In the CARES Act, the issue was ""an unanticipated problem,"" and in December, there was no opportunity to amend the bill. The issue had come up before. In 2009, President Barack Obama’s economic recovery package barred stimulus checks for most prisoners. Only a few thousand got them, through an exception in the law for those who had just gone to jail. In 2020, Washington put a priority on getting checks to people as quickly as possible. The CARES Act kept the eligibility rules broad and simple. Basically, anyone who was an American citizen or permanent legal resident, wasn’t claimed as a dependent by someone else, and had filed a tax return (or didn’t need to because they made very little), could get a check. With the December bill, Republicans could have added a prisoner ban to the legislation before it came to an up-or-down vote. The issue of prisoners and stimulus checks had long been in the news. Earlier in the year, the IRS blocked CARES Act payments to prisoners. That prompted a class action lawsuit on behalf of incarcerated people, arguing that the IRS rule was arbitrary and unlawful. In October, a federal judge ruled against the IRS and said the government had to issue the checks. The judge ruled that the CARES Act had no language restricting payments to prisoners, and the administration couldn’t invent one. That only applied to the CARES Act, but the point is, Republicans had ample opportunity to grapple with the issue as the December bill was being written. Despite having the right to stimulus checks, many prisoners hit a stumbling block: The IRS sent the inmates debit cards that some states couldn’t process.  Cotton said Democrats voted to give stimulus checks to people in prison. They did, arguing that to do otherwise would harm the families of prisoners. It’s worth noting that Cotton and other Senate Republicans voted for previous relief packages that also resulted in prisoners getting checks.  With that clarification, we rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097082240>],/factchecks/2021/mar/09/tom-cotton/yes-democrats-voted-send-stimulus-checks-prisoners/

Rubio takes Democratic school reopening vote out of context
","The path toward bringing students back to real classrooms with teachers and desks and art in the hallways has taken many twists and turns. The Democrats’ massive COVID-19 relief bill has $125 billion to help schools bring their students back and make up for a troubled year. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., had an amendment that would tie aid to how fully reopened a school was. When his amendment failed on a mostly party-line vote, Rubio tweeted his disdain. ""Tonight, Democrats voted to send reopening money to schools that refuse to reopen,"" he wrote March 6. Tonight Democrats voted to send re-opening money to schools that refuse to re-open. https://t.co/aQgVBDTUzh Let’s unpack that. The relief package provided money for a variety of purposes, including summer remedial education, student counseling, rebuilding ventilation systems and taking any steps needed to slow the spread of the virus. Rubio’s amendment would have tweaked the distribution formula for those billions in school aid. Under his proposal, every school district could count on getting 25% of whatever amount would be its share. (That share would be tied to the federal Title I funds the district normally received.) Beyond that 25%, ""for each school day in a five-day school week"" that district schools were open to 100% of their students, the district would get an additional 15% of its money.  ""This amendment incentivizes us to get our kids back in school,"" Rubio said March 6 on the Senate floor. And he targeted one group that he felt stands in the way.  ""We do have unions — and to be fair, not all — but we do have unions that say, ‘We're not going back until next year,’ even if all the (safety) measures are put in place,"" Rubio said. Rubio chastised Democrats for voting to send reopening money to schools that refuse to open. But his criticism contains some misleading elements. Rubio’s term ""refuse to reopen"" casts schools as adopting a policy simply as a matter of preference. But many factors drive school closures.  Education researchers who have pulled together data on schools and the coronavirus found that schools that choose to reopen don’t necessarily stay open. The Center for Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington has been tracking 477 school districts. Many of them began to bring students back at the start of the school year, but then reversed course. Between November and December, remote learning increased, by 7% in suburban communities and 20% in urban areas. ""Several districts shifted toward more opening through the fall but seemed to pull back on these partial reopenings as the winter surge took hold,"" said center associate director Betheny Gross.   Tactical shifts in response to the virus make it difficult to define schools as ones that ""refuse to reopen.""  Gross said the great majority of schools seem to aim to reopen at least partially. Only about 7% relied solely on remote teaching for all grades in October, November and December. Rubio’s claim also simplifies the nature of the bill’s school aid. The $125 billion is aimed at much more than just reopening schools. With an eye on remedial teaching, it orders districts to reserve 20% of their funds for measures such as summer school, after-school tutoring and an extended school year. The school aid spans many years to sustain efforts to help students make up lost ground. We reached out to Rubio’s office and did not hear back. Rubio’s comment suggests that returning kids to school is a low priority among Democrats. In January, President Joe Biden released a pandemic strategy plan that said the country is ""committed to ensuring that students and educators are able to resume safe, in-person learning as quickly as possible, with the goal of getting a majority of K-8 schools safely open in 100 days.""  The following month, a reporter asked press secretary Jen Psaki to elaborate on Biden’s goal of reopening schools.  ""His goal that he set is to have the majority of schools — so, more than 50% — open by day 100 of his presidency,"" she said Feb. 9. ""And that means some teaching in classrooms. So, at least one day a week. Hopefully, it’s more. And obviously it is as much as is safe in each school and local district.""  A week later, at a CNN town hall, Biden said ""the goal will be five days a week,"" and he thought that for grades K-8, the country would ""be close"" to seeing a majority of schools fully reopened. High schools, with the greater chances of viral spread, might be more challenging, Biden said. Rubio said that ""Democrats voted to send reopening money to schools that refuse to reopen."" Democrats voted down a Rubio amendment that would have tied the school aid amounts to whether school buildings were open to students. But education experts said it is not accurate to define closed or partly closed school buildings as ones that ""refuse to reopen."" Some schools that brought some students back backtracked in response to surging infections in the community.  Also, Rubio described the Democratic vote as being narrowly about reopening. They voted for money to help more schools reopen, to make changes to stay open and to provide remedial instruction to make up for lost ground. Rubio’s claim is partly accurate, but leaves out important context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809739F940>],/factchecks/2021/mar/09/marco-rubio/rubio-takes-democratic-school-reopening-vote-out-c/

Georgia bill would ban giving food, water to voters in line
","After Joe Biden narrowly won Georgia, and the Democrats won a pair of Senate races, Republican lawmakers there have proposed dozens of measures that would overhaul how Georgia voters cast ballots in future elections. One sweeping elections bill, Georgia House Bill 531, would limit the locations of absentee ballot drop boxes, require more identification for absentee voting and limit weekend early voting. Facebook posts said the state legislation ""makes it a misdemeanor to give food or water to voters waiting in line."" The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, the post is accurate. A state bill would expressly ban giving food or water to voters in line, which is more explicit than existing law that broadly bans gifts to voters. Georgia is one of many states where Republican lawmakers have introduced bills that restrict voting access, despite the fact that Republican election officials said the 2020 election was secure. Georgia HB 531 has a section that prohibits ""any money or gifts, including, but not limited to, food and drink, to an elector."" Such giveaways will be banned within 150 feet of a building where people are voting, within any polling place or within 25 feet of any voter standing in line.  The bill would make a violation a misdemeanor that carries a maximum fine of $1,000 and maximum imprisonment of up to one year in jail. The bill passed the House 97-72 on March 1 and awaits a vote in the Senate. For years, voting rights advocates have organized efforts to give away bottles of water or food near voting sites where residents sometimes wait in line for hours to vote. Voters in black-majority neighborhoods have had disproportionate waiting times. ""Ideally no one would wait (to vote) more than 30 minutes, but that’s not the reality,"" said Andrea Young, executive director of the ACLU of Georgia. Generally, some of the larger food events are organized by those with ties to the left, although they make the food available to anyone. Pizza to the Polls told PolitiFact that it delivered more than 7,000 boxes of pizza and more than 65,000 snacks during the general election and Senate runoff. The group was co-founded by a 2016 Obama field organizer but says it is nonpartisan: ""Ain’t nothing partisan about trying to make voting less of a drag,"" it says on its website. Chef José Andrés’ World Central Kitchen, as part of its Chefs for the Polls project, brought tacos, sandwiches and pizza to lines of voters in Georgia in 2020, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The group is also nonpartisan, but Andres supported Biden’s candidacy.  Existing Georgia law bans giving gifts ""for the purpose of registering as a voter, voting, or voting for a particular candidate."" That provision doesn’t mention food or water directly, but the Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has interpreted it to include food or water. In February, the Georgia elections board referred for investigation to prosecutors a couple of cases in which candidates gave food or water to voters.  Matthew Wilson bought four pizzas and passed out slices to those in line to vote in 2018, according to Reporter Newspapers. Wilson, a Democrat who won his race for state representative, said he distributed the pizza after getting permission from a poll manager. Kelly Rose, a Democrat who lost a state senate race, told PolitiFact that her team handed out water, oranges and chips at a 2020 polling site. ""A woman passed out one day we were there,"" Rose told PolitiFact. Rose said she didn’t campaign at the site and didn’t break the law. (A state law bans soliciting votes within 150 feet of a building where voting takes place.) We reached out to the chief author of HB 531, Republican Rep. Barry Fleming, to ask why the state needs a law to ban giveaways to voters in line when state law already bans gifts, but we didn’t hear back. Facebook posts state that the Georgia House passed a bill that ""makes it a misdemeanor to give food or water to voters waiting in line."" HB 531, which passed the House March 1, bans giving food and drinks to electors within 150 feet of a building where people are voting, within any polling place or within 25 feet of any voter standing in line. A violation is considered a misdemeanor.  We rate this claim True.
