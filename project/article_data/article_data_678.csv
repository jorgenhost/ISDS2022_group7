Are overdose drug deaths finally going down, as Conway says?
","A conservative broadcaster who predicts President Donald Trump will be re-elected recently asked White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, ""What will you do during the second term?"" Whatever he wants me to do,"" Conway said, referring to Trump. She said she hoped to continue leading the president’s efforts to combat drug abuse. ""We now have the first decline in overdose deaths due to drugs in 30 years - since 1990,"" she told radio host John Fredericks, a Portsmouth-based broadcaster during a Nov. 20 interview. We checked if Kelly is right about overdose drug deaths going down for the first time in three decades. The White House press office referred us to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC records show there were 9,463 overdose deaths in 1990, and the number rose every year through 2017, when it peaked at 70,669.  All the CDC figures through 2017 are final counts of reported overdose deaths. The figures from 2018 onward are provisional, meaning they still may be adjusted slightly upward because overdose deaths sometimes require special investigations, creating a lag time before they are reported. Provisional numbers show a downturn in 2018, when there were 68,039 overdose deaths. That’s a 3.8% decrease from the record 70,669 in 2017. It’s a preliminary drop of 2,630 deaths. The CDC says the discrepancy between preliminary and final numbers is ""typically small."" In 2017, ""approximately 200"" overdose deaths were added between the provisional and final tally. Experts told us it’s almost certain the decrease will be verified in the final numbers, due in spring 2020. Until then, ""You’re safe if you say there’s a downturn based on provisional numbers,"" said Andrew Kolodny, a senior scientist at Brandeis University specializing in opioid and heroin addiction. Conway didn’t make that distinction. Technical phrasing aside, Kolodny said the apparent decrease is significant, although he added that the 68,039 overdose deaths in 2018 show ""we still have a long way to go."" Kolodny and Keith Humphreys - a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University who studies addiction and drug control policy, said the apparent downturn has been largely caused by three factors: Better addiction treatment;  More caution by doctors in prescribing opioids; and  Greater availability of Naloxone, a drug that counters an opioid overdose. The decrease appears to be continuing, according to CDC provisional numbers. In the 12-month period ending April 30, 2018, there were 69,065 overdose deaths. In the year ending April 30, 2019, there were 67,123 such deaths - a 2.8% drop. Kolodny thinks the drop in overdose deaths is the start of a trend. Humphreys is skeptical, noting the spread of Fentanyl, a painkiller the CDC says is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. ""Fentanyl has still largely not penetrated the Western United States but it could very easily do so, increasing overdose deaths in the future,"" he said. Although the provisional downturn started during Trump’s term, the two professors we spoke to don’t give the president much credit for it. They said Trump waited until 2018 to set an an anti-drug agenda and goal to end Obamacare could make it harder to get addiction treatment.   Kolodny, however, commended Trump for publicizing the opioid crisis and faulted his predecessor - Barack Obama - for doing little to combat drugs. ""Compared to Obama, President Trump has done a better job speaking to the problem,"" he said. Our ruling Conway says, ""We now have the first decline in overdose deaths due to drugs in 30 years - since 1990."" CDC statistics show U.S. overdose drug deaths increased every year from 1990 to 2017, when there were 70,639 fatalities. Figures show 68,039 overdeath deaths in 2018  - a drop of 2,630. An issue: The 2018 figures are preliminary, and will increase before the final count is completed in spring 2020. The small downturn is not official. It needs to be qualified as provisional, and Conway doesn’t do that.  There are overwhelming odds, however, that Conway’s statement will turn out to be right. The CDC says the difference between preliminary and final numbers is ""typically small."" In 2017, about 200 overdose deaths were added between the preliminary and final tally. So Conway’s statement, although technically flawed, almost assuredly is on track. We rate it Mostly True. ","[('Kellyanne Conway, radio interview, Nov. 20, 2019 (12:09 mark).', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RbYuZi79JY'), ('Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""Deaths: Final Data for 1998,"" Table 20.', 'No link'), ('CDC, ""Deaths: Final Data for 2017,"" Table I-1.', 'https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr48/nvs48_11.pdf'), ('CDC, ""Provisional Drug Overdose Counts,"" Nov. 4, 2019.', 'No link'), ('CDC, ""Fentanyl,"" accessed Nov. 25, 2019.', 'https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf'), ('The New York Times, ""Drug overdose deaths drop in the U.S.for first time since 1990,"" July 17, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Interviews with Andrew Kolodny, senior scientist at Brandeis University, Nov. 21-22, 2019.', 'https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm#differences_between_final_and_provisional_data'), ('Email interviews with Keith Humphreys, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University, Nov. 21-22.', 'No link'), ('\xa0', 'https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/opioids/fentanyl.html')]",/factchecks/2019/nov/26/kellyanne-conway/are-overdose-drug-deaths-finally-going-down-conway/
"['Crime', 'Missouri', 'Jean Evans']","
Missouri’s crime is high, but that’s not the full story
","Last month, Gov. Mike Parson began a task force to ""help combat violent crime in the St. Louis region."" In September, Democrats filed 16 gun-related bills during a special session.  So you can bet that crime will be a big topic in the General Assembly session in January. Jean Evans, the executive director of the Missouri Republican Party, spoke up about crime on a recent Missouri Times interview panel. The panel focused on St. Louis crime, but Evans began talking about the state as a whole.  ""Missouri, in general, has more crime, percentage-wise, than the rest of the country. So, we are seeing overall crime throughout the country is going down but not here in Missouri,"" Evans said.  We wanted to know whether Missouri’s crime rate is higher than the national average, and if the rate is going up while the rest of the country’s crime is going down. We spoke with Evans to see where she got this information. ""Missouri’s murder rate is higher than the national average,"" she said. ""There are numerous resources for crime statistics, from the FBI to Wikipedia. I’ve seen reports in both the Post-Dispatch and KC Star on this topic. I wasn’t quoting a specific article.""  We looked. The articles Evans might have been citing look into metropolitan crime, not Missouri in general. And the Wikipedia page ""Crime in Missouri"" contained statistics from 2011.  So we decided to dig some more.  The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program is the main source for most statistics about crime. The two most prominent categories are violent crime and property crime. Violent crime is defined as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Property crime includes burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson.  In 2018, the United States violent crime rate per 100,000 residents was 380.6 compared to 502.1 for Missouri.  Both fell last year from 20l7 to 2018 after three years of increases. Missouri’s violent crime last year decreased by 5.2% while the United States saw a 3% decrease.  In the larger picture, Missouri’s violent crime rate has increased in the last five years. In 2013, the state’s violent crime rate per 100,000 residents was 433.7, and in 2018 that number was up to 502.1. In 2013, the United States violent crime rate per 100,000 residents was 379.1, and in 2018 was 380.6.  ""I always say you want to look at crime trends, you have to look at a span that's more than just year to year, you have to look kind of at a five-year trend,"" said Aida Hass-Wisecup, a criminology professor at Missouri State University.  In property crime, the nation saw a steady decrease in the past five years. Missouri’s property crime rate has had some fluctuations, like from 2016 to 2017 there was a 1.5% increase. But overall,  the property crime rate for five years decreased in Missouri. Evans’ response includes murder rates, so we looked into that too. In Missouri, murder rates have increased since 2013. The United States saw a large spike from 2014 to 2016 in murder rates, but they’ve decreased since then.   Hass-Wisecup noted that analyzing crime by metropolitan statistical areas, because looking at the overall state can leave ""a very distorted perception.""  ""You kind of have to take crime data with caution,"" Hass-Wisecup said. ""Sometimes, arrest does not mean more crime, it means more crime is being detected, because of law enforcement becoming more vigilant.""  In fact, on the FBI’s 2018 Crime in the United States page, it says, ""It is important for users of UCR data, including federal data, to avoid drawing such simplistic conclusions as one area is safer than another or one agency is more or less efficient than another based solely on crime counts."" Evans said, ""Missouri, in general, has more crime, percentage-wise, than the rest of the country. So, we are seeing overall crime throughout the country is going down but not here in Missouri."" According to the FBI data, Missouri’s violent crime rate has risen sharply over the past five years. The national rate has risen, but not by much. For property crime, the state and nation have seen decreases since 2013.  Evans’ claim is partially accurate, but generalizes the state and ignores the most recent FBI data. We rate this claim Half True.","[('Email exchange with Jean Evans, Oct. 16, 2019', 'https://themissouritimes.com/65466/evans-dueker-take-a-look-at-st-louis-crime/'), ('Interview with Aida Hass-Wisecup, a criminology professor at Missouri State University, Nov. 18, 2019', 'No link'), ('Missouri Times,\xa0Evans, Dueker take a look at St. Louis crime, accessed Oct. 16, 2019\xa0', 'https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/tables/table-4'), ('FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program,\xa0Crime in the United States by Region, Geographic Division, and State, accessed Oct. 16, 2019', 'No link'), ('Missouri Times,\xa0Parson creates task forces, dedicates $2M for victims to combat violent crime in St. Louis, Sept. 19, 2019', 'https://themissouritimes.com/65066/parson-creates-task-forces-dedicates-2-million-for-victims-to-help-combat-violent-crime-in-st-louis/'), ('KMOV 4,\xa0Missouri has 3rd highest murder rate in country: Report, Oct. 16, 2019', 'No link'), (""The Kansas City Star,\xa0'National shame': Missouri leads U.S. in rate of black homicide, Aug. 11, 2019"", 'https://www.kmov.com/news/missouri-has-rd-highest-murder-rate-in-country-report/article_83691040-f01e-11e9-90eb-9bf040c9bbbf.html'), ('Wikipedia,\xa0Crime in Missouri, accessed Oct. 22, 2019\xa0', 'No link'), ('St. Louis Post-Dispatch,\xa0Deadly turn: Study shows violent crime growing deadlier in St. Louis, July 1, 2019\xa0', 'https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article233343277.html'), ('Gov.

Trump, Obama story on ‘vacation scam’ was fabricated by satire website
","Did President Donald Trump send former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama a bill to ""repay the government"" for vacations they took that weren’t ""official state business""?  The account is just as false now as it was when it first appeared in 2017. The bogus story recently resurfaced in an Oct. 29 Facebook post that has been shared over 21,000 times. A portion of the lengthy post reads: ""... TRUMP JUST ENDED OBAMA’S VACATION SCAM! Before Obama left office, he arranged with the State Department for a series of ‘official visits’ to foreign countries spanning the next 20 years. Using discretionary funds from the Office of Presidential Visits and Vacations, Obama was planning to weasel what would have been another $2.1 billion in free vacations for him and up to 24 members of his family plus staff and even a dog sitter until the year 2036"" The post continues, saying that Trump canceled the Obamas’ plans, recalled Secret Service agents and sent the Obamas a $214 million bill for vacations they took that weren’t ""official state business."" It claims the Obamas spent 692 days on vacation. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

No, President Obama didn’t take $2.1 billion from the ""Office of Presidential Visits and Vacations"" — an office that does not exist — to pay for family vacations for the next 20 years, and President Trump didn’t end the ""vacation scam"" and bill the Obamas to repay a portion of the money.  None of this is true.

U.S. Rep. Ron Kind hits target on claim that he voted for Clinton and Trump impeachment inquiries
","U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, in office since 1996, has been on the front lines of history.  In 1998, the Wisconsin Democrat had to vote on an impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton, a Democrat.  This time around, Kind faced a vote on the impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump, a Republican. Partisan politics in Washington has changed dramatically in the two decades between the votes, with today’s open warfare fueled by a divide among the public that plays out every day on TV and social media. Kind represents a district covering the western part of the state that Trump won by 4 percentage points in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton.  Party lines aside, Kind says he has a one-of-a-kind distinction in Congress. ""I am the only member of Congress that voted for both inquiries, the Clinton inquiry and now the Trump inquiry,"" Kind said on WISN-TV’s ""UpFront"" program.  Is that true? Clinton’s impeachment It’s been more than 20 years since Clinton became the second president to be impeached. The first was Andrew Johnson in 1868. After a nearly five-year investigation led by independent prosecutor Ken Starr, Clinton was ultimately impeached by the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. But the effort did not muster enough votes from the Senate to remove Clinton from office.  In all, 31 Democrats voted in favor of a Republican resolution to launch a formal impeachment inquiry of Clinton.  Kind -- who was starting his second term in Congress at the time -- was one of them.  Ultimately, four articles of impeachment were brought against Clinton, including two perjury charges, one charge of abuse of power and one of obstruction of justice. Kind voted against all of the articles of impeachment, and the House eventually voted to impeach on obstruction of justice and a single perjury charge.  The perjury charge passed the House with a 228-206 vote, while the charge for obstruction of justice passed with a 221-212 vote. The Senate followed with a 50-50 split on the accusation that Clinton obstructed justice, but dismissed the charge of perjury 55-45. Let’s fast forward to today. The case against Trump In October 2019, House Democrats voted 232-196 -- a vote that fell largely on party lines -- to pursue an impeachment inquiry into Trump.  The investigation revolves around accusations that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine unless the country agreed to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a chief Trump rival in the 2020 presidential race.  Kind has been less vocal on Trump and the impeachment process than his Democratic counterparts Gwen Moore of Milwaukee and Mark Pocan of Madison. Kind has been open about his support for investigating Trump, but told Wisconsin Public Radio in an interview that aired Oct. 17, 2019 that impeachment and removal from office should be a ""last resort."" At the time, Kind called the allegations ""extremely serious"" but said he wanted to gather all the facts before deciding whether impeachment was the proper path forward.  He also referred to the actions involved in the allegation as unlawful, unpatriotic and unconstitutional.  In all, 55 current members of the House -- 40 Democrats, 15 Republicans -- were also in office during the time the House voted to start an impeachment inquiry into Clinton. Our research shows Kind, indeed, was the only one to vote for both. Our rating Kind said he was ""the only member of Congress that voted for both inquiries -- the Clinton inquiry and now the Trump inquiry."" We found Kind did vote yes to both inquiries and of the 55 members of the Congress who took part in both votes, he is an outlier.  We rate his claim True. ","[('UPFRONT, ‘Upfront’ recap: Impeachment inquiry looks ‘more and more problematic’ for Trump, U.S. Rep says, Nov. 17, 2019', 'https://www.wisn.com/article/upfront-recap-impeachment-inquiry-looks-more-and-more-problematic-for-trump-us-rep-kind-says/29819702'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Wisconsin Democrat Ron Kind, tight-lipped so far, moves closer to supporting Trump impeachment, Oct. 30, 2019', 'No link'), ('Appleton Post Crescent, 20 years ago, Wisconsin lawmakers voted on Bill Clinton’s impeachment.

Evidence lacking for Pritzker’s pension buyout claim
","During a recent sit-down interview at a local business forum, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker dismissed the possibility of changing the Illinois constitution to make it possible to reduce public retiree benefits. Echoing growing calls from certain groups to ask voters next year to eliminate the clause that protects those benefits, the moderator at the event hosted by the Economic Club of Chicago asked Pritzker why he won’t promote such a plan as part of his broader push to shore up the state’s finances. In response, he argued there are other ways to help fill the state’s massive pension hole. One of his examples caught our attention: ""In the spring, we expanded a program to buy out — a voluntary program — to buy out retirees when they’re retiring at 60% of what their pensions would be,"" Pritzker said. ""People are choosing to take the money up front. It’s saving the state money. In fact, a study was done of what the savings would be and it’s billions and billions, potentially $25 billion of savings. And by the way, people are choosing it — almost 20% of people who are retiring are choosing that buyout."" Illinois’ unfunded liability — the gap between its pension assets and the benefits it has committed to pay future retirees — is nearly $137 billion, largely due to decades of underfunding by public officials. And $25 billion sounds like it could go a long way toward addressing that shortfall. But Pritzker left a lot of questions unanswered. He didn’t provide a timeframe for those savings, nor was it clear from his remarks which program he was describing or what study determined it could save the state billions. So we decided to find out. In response to our inquiry, Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said the governor was referencing two programs that allow some participants in the state’s three largest retirement systems to forego certain benefits in exchange for an upfront payment. Both buyout programs were created as part of the 2018 state budget and were extended in the budget Pritzker signed this year to June 30, 2024 from their original sunset date in mid-2021. But each program is more limited than what the governor described. One program allows people who formerly worked for the state — including its public schools and universities — long enough to qualify for a state pension and who have not yet begun to draw from it to trade all rights to a future retirement benefit in exchange for a lump sum equal to 60% of the total lifetime pension they would have received. Despite being a total buyout worth the same percentage Pritzker referenced, this program applies to a much smaller subset of state retirement system members than his comment suggests. The other program permits retiring members who were hired before 2011 to trade the 3% compounded automatic annual increase to which they are entitled under the state’s two-tiered pension structure for an annual increase of 1.5% on the original value of their pension, which would not be compounded. In exchange, they receive a lump sum equal to 70% of the difference between the value of the higher and lower annual increases. In short, it is not a total pension buyout. So far, participation and cost savings associated with both programs has been limited. Out of 3,600 qualified inactive members of the State Employees’ Retirement System (SERS), which covers state employees who do not work in public education or for the judicial and legislative branches, 22 have elected to take a total buyout since it became an option for those members in 2018, according to a spokesman. At the Teachers Retirement System of Illinois (TRS), 297 out of 14,598 eligible members have decided to participate, a spokesman for that system told us. The participation rate was higher for the accelerated annual increase program. Since last December, 719 out of 2,889 retiring Tier 1 SERS members have elected to take it, for a participation rate of nearly 25%, according to SERS. At TRS, which covers employees at public schools outside Chicago, 596 — or 16% — of the system’s 3,715 eligible retiring members opted for it this year. For context, however, there are roughly 61,000 retired SERS members and 64,000 current employees. TRS, the state’s largest system, has about 112,000 retirees currently drawing benefits and 163,000 current employees. ""The statement makes it sound like a large portion of people are taking these options and it’s important to realize that it’s a limited pool who’s even eligible for these buyout programs,"" said Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois-Chicago and an expert on state and local pensions. We did not receive a response from the third major state pension fund, the State Universities Retirement System, by publication time. As for Pritzker’s contention that the buyouts would save the state billions, his spokeswoman said the governor was presented with an independent analysis that came to that conclusion. However, she declined to provide the study itself or offer any further details about where it came from and what it was based on. ""The governor was referencing a proprietary study conducted by and for an outside organization that he was presented,"" Abudayyeh wrote in an email. ""It determined that pension buyouts, depending on the structure of the options, have the potential to save billions, including as much as roughly $25 billion. The administration has not yet determined its estimate, nor did the governor say that this was the administration’s estimate for how much money buyouts are currently saving or will save."" Without access to the study, we cannot confirm Pritzker’s comments square with its findings. This July, however, a budget watchdog group published an analysis finding the programs had ""generated relatively minor savings"" in the last fiscal year. While the programs were expected to save the state more than $400 million that year, they generated just $13 million in savings for the state’s general fund, the Civic Federation found. As the group’s analysis notes, the original state estimate overstated the potential savings because it was based on an actuarial review of a different buyout proposal that extended through 2045. ""It seems like these programs are going to save the state some money, but it’s likely to be much less than people may have thought,"" said Kass, the state pension expert. Pritzker said a study projected that a pension buyout program he expanded would save ""billions and billions, potentially $25 billion."" During his remarks, he described a program that allows the state to ""buy out retirees when they’re retiring at 60% of what their pensions would be."" There is a state program that allows for that, but it is limited to a smaller segment of state pensioners than his comments suggest. The governor’s office told us Pritzker was referencing a private study showing the state’s buyout programs are projected to save billions, including up to $25 billion. But they declined to share it with us or describe its specific findings. We rate Pritzker’s claim Mostly False.

","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently claimed President Donald Trump isn’t serious about building his promised Southern border wall and that his comments on the topic ""are really an applause line at a rally.""  ""The President hasn’t built any new wall in the whole term of office,"" Pelosi added, speaking on ""Face the Nation"" this week.   Trump’s intentions are difficult to judge, but we can examine his progress, or lack thereof, on the border project.  Was Pelosi right that no ""new wall"" has been built?  Our research We started by reviewing last week’s White House briefing by acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan. Asked by a reporter about the project, Morgan confirmed that all 78 miles of what he described as ""new"" border wall built so far are replacements for existing barriers. The work includes building steel bollard fencing, which consists of vertical steel posts with a small amount of space between them.  It is not, however, the solid concrete wall that Trump promised during his campaign and said Mexico would pay for. ""The Trump Administration has not completed any new miles of border wall. Replacement wall is not new wall,"" Pelosi’s spokesman Drew Hammill told us in an email.  Hammill added that the House Appropriations Committee hasn’t funded any new border wall, at least not of the type Trump had promised.  That is supported by The Washington Post’s September analysis of the project’s funding. ""Trump asked Congress in 2018 for $25 billion to cover the cost, but Congress refused. Lawmakers appropriated $1.57 billion, restricted to ""fencing,"" such as ""currently deployed steel bollard designs,"" the Post reported.  As PolitiFact National reported back in January, ""Congress has not appropriated money for a wall. Fencing is being built or has been completed at the southwest border. But not a wall.""  President Donald Trump reviews border wall prototypes, Tuesday, March 13, 2018, in San Diego. Evan Vucci / AP Photo  First truly new section Pelosi’s statement ignores one key new stretch:  Construction started in late October on the first new section where no structures stood previously, just south of Donna, Texas, according to a recent New York Times article.  This eight-mile stretch will take months to complete. So far, it includes two twin see-through panels of 18-foot-tall steel beams, according to the Times. A matter of semantics Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said much of the debate over Trump’s progress and whether he’s built any ""new wall"" comes down to semantics.  ""It depends on your definition of 'new,' Cardinal Brown wrote in an email. ""If 'new' is defined as newly-built, even if it is replacing other barriers in the same location, then you can accurately say new wall has been built. If 'new' is defined as built in new locations along the border where previous barriers did not exist, then it would be correct to say that there hasn’t been any new wall built. It is that semantic difference that the government and Democrats are exploiting in their rhetoric.""  Our rating House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently claimed President Trump ""hasn’t built any new wall"" during his time in office.  That’s supported, in part, by the Trump administration’s Customs and Border Protection acting commissioner. He confirmed at a press briefing last week that all 78 miles of what he described as ""new"" border wall built so far are replacements for existing barriers.  These replacement barriers, however, aren’t the solid, concrete wall candidate Trump talked about. They are see-through bollard fencing.  Pelosi’s statement does leave out one piece of key information. Construction is now underway on the first original stretch of border barriers during Trump’s presidency, an eight-mile section of fencing in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.  Pelosi’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

No, Ukraine didn’t indict Burisma on Wednesday
","Around the time U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland made some unflattering allegations about President Donald Trump and other administration officials during an impeachment hearing, new claims about Hunter Biden and the Ukrainian energy company Burisma started to spread on social media.  ""BREAKING NEWS,"" began one such post on Facebook. ""The Ukrainian government just indicted the Burisma gas company & named Hunter Biden for accepting millions of dollars from a slush fund. Your move, Dems.""  Another post appears to show Clint Eastwood — though it’s not really him — tweeting about the ""breaking"" and ""developing"" news.  ""#Ukraine just indicted Taras Burdeinyi, the chief executive officer of #Burisma,"" this post said. ""Including naming #HunterBiden as the recipient of millions of dollars from slush fund. The tide is turning folks."" Both posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The Facebook account called ""Educating Liberals"" that shared the first post also wrote: ""Before the Facebook ‘fact-checkers’ try to call this fake news & take away my reach again…. here’s a source."" The account linked to a story published on Interfax-Ukraine, a news agency that’s part of the Russian outlet Interfax. The story’s headline says, ""MPs demand Zelensky, Trump investigate suspicion of U.S.-Ukraine corruption involving $7.4 bln."" However, the story doesn’t describe an indictment. Rather, it says Ukrainian members of parliament held a press conference at Interfax-Ukraine to demand Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky and Trump investigate what they called suspected money laundering involving Burisma founder Minister Mykola Zlochevsky and former President Viktor Yanukovych. According to the story, one of the members of parliament, Andriy Derkach, said that the money transferred to ""representatives of the Burisma Group, including Hunter Biden,"" amounted to $16.5 million.    Burisma is central to the U.S. House impeachment inquiry. Trump is accused of holding up U.S. aid to Ukraine on the condition that Zelensky announce an investigation into Burisma and Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. Hunter Biden was on Burisma’s board of directors until this year. His involvement has led to scrutiny from Republicans and inspired conspiracy theories.  But as NBC News reported, there was no announcement of an indictment Wednesday, as the Facebook posts claim. And according to the Daily Beast, Ukraine’s chief prosecutor, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, said there is no investigation into the Bidens by his office. Here’s what did happen: In October, Ryaboshapka, announced his office would conduct a wide-ranging review of all previous cases involving Burisma, according to NBC. And on Nov. 20, Reuters reported that Ryaboshapka said the country would widen its investigation into Burisma founder Zlochevsky to include suspicion of embezzling state funds.  Reuters reported that the prosecutor’s announcement followed the press conference that Interfax-Ukraine wrote about, in which members of parliament called for an investigation into Burisma-related money laundering. There, a document from the general prosecutor’s office was leaked, Reuters said, showing that another prosecutor suspected Zlochevsky, the Burisma founder, of using his official position to embezzle $33 million from the country’s central bank.   According to NBC News, the finance blog ZeroHedge appears to have misconstrued the Interfax-Ukraine story and within an hour of publishing its own dispatch, the claim of an indictment had spread on Twitter by tens of thousands of users.  Nina Jankowicz, a former adviser to Ukraine’s foreign ministry and a disinformation researcher at the Wilson Center, told NBC the claims appear to be a misinterpretation of a press conference related to allegations ""about corruption with Burisma’s head, which have been well known for a long time."" She speculated that the lawmakers who held the press conference were angling for Trump’s attention and trying to ""curry favor"" with his administration.  Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who researches kleptocracy in Russia, told NBC that the lawmakers pushing new allegations at the press conference — Oleksandr Dubinsky and Andriy Derkach — are ""professional disinformers.""  ""This is generally known in Ukraine,"" he said, ""this is not outstanding news.

Post about Nike factory workers uses outdated numbers for pay, hours
","In September 2018, Nike announced an endorsement deal with former NFL quarterback and activist Colin Kaepernick. Since then, claims about the company’s labor practices have flooded the internet, attracting thousands of shares on Facebook and Twitter. Many of these viral posts feature a photo of Nike factory workers accompanied by a claim that the company exploits workers with long hours and abysmally low wages. (Most posts are screenshots of a September 2018 tweet by conservative commentator Ryan Fournier.) The posts say:  ""Just so I'm clear: These factory workers (which are 80% female) are making NIKE's for 20 cents an hour and working 70 to 80 hours a week, so NIKE can profit enough to pay Colin Kaepernick millions to speak out against oppression and injustice?"" The Associated Press photo accompanying the post is legitimate, though quite old. It shows Vietnamese workers putting finishing touches on Nike shoes at a factory in Ho Chi Minh City in February 2005. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is true that, at one time, Nike paid factory workers close to 20 cents per hour and that many worked over 10 hours a day, six days a week. While most of these numbers are now outdated, experts tell us that overseas factory workers for Nike (and most other major garment industry bands) continue to work long hours for low wages. Let’s take a look. In October 1996, CBS’ 48 Hours news program aired an investigative report on the conditions of Nike factories in Vietnam. The segment revealed that factory workers, mostly women, worked ""six days a week for only $40 a month,"" which translated to about 20 cents an hour. An investigation by Dara O’Rourke, a researcher with the Transnational Resource and Action Center, followed in 1997 and reported several labor law violations at the Vietnamese Tae Kwang Vina plant, a factory that employed over 9,000 workers who produced 400,000 pairs of shoes a month for Nike. According to the investigation, the plant’s night-shift employees worked an average of 10.5 hours a day, six days per week at a monthly salary of $40. A 2003 World Bank report said Nike violated Vietnamese environmental and labor laws by exposing 10,000 workers at the Tae Kwang Vina plant to toxic solvents and forcing them to work above legal overtime limits. The report noted that the investigations, along with public outcry evoked by activists in Vietnam and the United States, prompted Nike to make improvements: ""Consequently, Nike took proactive measures and allowed independent auditing of the sweatshops. In 1999, Nike implemented its own ‘Code of Conduct’ in Vietnamese factories. During recent years, there has been a visible improvement in VT’s practices, such as safer work conditions and workers’ awareness of their rights and entitlements."" PolitiFact reached out to the Clean Clothes Campaign, an alliance of labor unions that focuses on improving working conditions in the garment and sportswear industries.  The organization told us that the numbers for the pay and hours, aren’t precise but  the sentiment with regard to fair pay and treatment is correct: Factory workers for Nike –– and other major sportswear brands such as Adidas and Under Armour –– do not earn ""anywhere near a living wage."" They confirmed that the claim of 80% of factory workers being women lines up with industry estimates, which have been as high as 85%. Clean Clothes also pointed us to a June 2019 report that surveyed top brands about their progress in implementing a living wage for workers and said most brands –– Nike included –– provided no evidence that their workers anywhere in the world were being paid a living wage. Research from 2014 shows that, in most of the Southeast Asian countries that Nike sources from, wages reach around 25% of a living wage.  Paul Roeland, a campaign coordinator with the Clean Clothes Campaign, told PolitiFact that, when it comes to working hours, most workers have a contract to work 48 hours a week but regularly continue working beyond that, often up to 60 hours a week. He said the hours fluctuate and are often longer during peak production times.   ""The factual numbers are shocking enough: it would come down to between 65-90 cents (USD) per hour (depending on the country), and regular 60-hour work weeks,"" Roeland told PolitiFact by email. That said, he bristled at the overall message in this viral post: ""At Clean Clothes Campaign, our aim is in supporting garment workers worldwide, as it has been over the past 30 years,"" Roeland said. ""However, we strongly believe that criticizing Nike's labour practices with the sole aim of disparaging the anti-racist activism of others, as some right-wing U.S. political figures are doing, is highly disingenuous. Garment workers deserve so much better than to be used as a handy argument in a social media meme."" PolitiFact reached out to Nike for a response but did not hear back in time for publication. Nike’s code of conduct for supplier facilities reads, ""the regular work week shall not exceed 48 hours"" and suppliers should ""allow workers at least 24 consecutive hours of rest in every seven-day period. All overtime work shall be consensual. Suppliers shall not request overtime on a regular basis and shall compensate all overtime work at a premium rate. Other than in extraordinary circumstances, the sum of regular and overtime hours in a week shall not exceed 60 hours."" It’s important to note that Nike isn’t alone. While wages and hours for factory workers vary from country to country, many major companies use the same factories and all pay the same low wages for their workers. Experts tell us that while it depends on the country and the volume of production, violation of legal overtime standards is common in the garment industry. Viral social media posts claim that Nike’s factory employees work 70 to 80 hours a week and get paid 20 cents an hour. The numbers in the post are outdated, but not entirely far off. Today, Nike pays workers more than 20 cents an hour and employees work, on average, a little less than 70 to 80 hours per week. However, workers rights experts tell us the pay from Nike and other major brands is still below a living wage and average weekly hours are routinely well above standard workweeks. We rate this Half True. ","[('Facebook post, Nov. 6, 2019', 'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=136660924407185&set=a.100344391372172&type=3&theater'), ('AP Images, THE NEW VIETNAM, April 11, 2005', 'No link'), (""Bleacher Report, Report: Colin Kaepernick's Nike Contract Worth 'Millions,' Will Get Branded Line, Sept. 3, 2018"", 'http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Associated-Press-International-News-Vietnam-Adv-/b6d7c9e31ce1da11af9f0014c2589dfb/45/0'), ('Snopes, Do Nike Factory Workers in Vietnam Earn 20 Cents Per Hour?, Sept. 7, 2018', 'No link'), ('CBS News, 48 Hours transcript, Oct. 17, 1996', 'https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2794022-report-colin-kaepernicks-nike-contract-worth-millions-will-get-branded-line'), ('Transnational Resource and Action Center, A CRITIQUE OF NIKE’S LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITING IN VIETNAM, 1997', 'No link'), ('World Bank, Nike in Vietnam: The Tae Kwang Vina Factory, March 1, 2003', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nike-workers-pay-kaepernick/'), ('Nike code of conduct, Accessed Nov. 21, 2019', 'No link'), ('Clean Clothes Campaign, Asia Wage Report, 2014\xa0', 'https://www.saigon.com/nike/48hrfmt.htm'), ('Clean Clothes Campaign, Major brands are failing on living wage commitments, June 14, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Paul Roeland campaign coordinator at the Clean Clothes Campaign, Nov. 20-22, 2019', 'https://nature.berkeley.edu/orourke/PDF/smoke.pdf')]",/factchecks/2019/nov/22/facebook-posts/post-about-nike-factory-workers-uses-outdated-numb/

No, Rep. Stefanik didn’t flip off camera at impeachment hearing. It’s photoshopped
","Did Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik really flip off a camera during one of the impeachment hearings? That’s what a viral photo circulating on Facebook appears to show.  No, Stefanik did not flip the bird during or after at the hearing. The image has been manipulated. The image looks as if Stefanik, who represents New York’s 21st district, is using the hand gesture while her colleagues stand in the background. The Facebook post’s caption reads:  ""US Representative Elise Stafanik and an ‘always trumper’ gives bird finger to the Democrats at the trump impeachment hearing. Classy!""

Cunningham claim about corporate money is misleading
","A Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in North Carolina wants to send a clear message: he won’t be a tool for big businesses. Cal Cunningham, who’s campaigning to be the Democratic nominee against Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, says he won’t take money from corporate political action committees. ""That means this campaign is funded by people like you -- not the special interests,"" he tweeted on July 31. Is it true that Cunningham has received no donations from special interests? PolitiFact has investigated similar claims by former Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke, Congressman Conor Lamb and, in North Carolina more recently, congressional candidate Kathy Manning.  While it’s true that Cunningham hasn’t received money from corporate PACs, he has received money from business executives and PACs that receive money from corporations. Corporate PACs The Center for Responsive Politics tracks donations of all types, including political action committees (PACs.) PACs are generally put into three categories: business, labor and ideological. The CRP’s campaign tracker backs up Cunningham’s claim that hasn’t accepted money from business PACs. That’s not necessarily a significant sacrifice for Cunningham, according to Brendan Quinn, CRP’s outreach and social media manager.  ""Corporate PACs don’t usually give that much to challengers,"" Quinn said. When those PACs do donate to Democrats, he said they typically give to those in safe districts. ""Not much would go to a Democrat trying to swing a Senate seat in a purple state,"" he said. Cunningham has received $10,000 from labor PACs, $22,590 from ideological PACs, and even more from PACs tied to Democrats in the U.S. Senate. And that’s where Cunningham’s claim comes into question. He’s received money from PACs that get some of their money from corporations. Other PACs Cunningham has received thousands from PACs tied to individual senators, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission. For example, Cunningham received $10,000 from Forward Together PAC, which is affiliated with Democratic US Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia. According to CRP, Forward Together has received money from employees of Amazon, Microsoft, and other big corporations. Cunningham also received $10,000 from Motor City PAC, affiliated with Democratic US Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan. Motor City recently received $5,000 donations from American Express, Charter Communications, Comcast, Delta Air Lines, FedEx, General Motors, Goldman Sachs and other large corporations.  So, even if Cunningham has shunned corporate PACs, may have received money that originated with a corporation. Some experts consider that degree of separation that some experts consider significant. Andrew Mayersohn, a committees researcher for the CRP, told PolitiFact last year that candidates who receive money from a Senate PAC money are more likely to feel indebted to the Senator than the company who donated to the senator’s PAC. In some cases, though, there’s no separation between Cunningham and corporate leaders. Cunningham has received thousands of dollars from corporate executives. CEO money He received big individual donations from the CEO of a financial consulting group, the founder of a pharmaceutical company, and the president of Blue Shield California, among others. End Citizens United, a group that aims to reduce the influence of money in politics, sees a distinction between receiving money from corporate CEOs and from corporate PACs. The PAC exists to benefit a company, while the motivation of an individual CEO is often unclear. ""Individuals can give to candidates for any reason,"" said Patrick Burwinkle, spokesman for End Citizens United. ""That candidate could align with (the CEOs) values,"" from reproductive rights to foreign policy and other issues. ""And that's why - unlike Senator Tillis - Cal has taken and followed a pledge against taking corporate PAC money while also releasing a comprehensive anti-corruption plan that would reform Washington's broken political system,"" said Rachel Petri, spokeswoman for Cunningham. Some, however, don’t see much of a difference in who the money is coming from.  Corporate PACs are funded by the corporations’ employees, not the organization itself. ""Every dime that goes into a pac is an individual dime, it’s just pooled resources,"" Cleta Mitchell, a conservative campaign-finance and election-law attorney told The Atlantic last year.  Michael Williams, founder of the public policy and communications consulting firm The Williams Group, explained his skepticism to Fortune Magazine earlier this year. ""What’s the difference? If you won’t take a particular bank’s money, but you’ll take the bank executive’s money?"" Williams told Fortune. ""Are you really materially changing anything?"" Our ruling Cunningham said his campaign hasn’t accepted corporate PAC money and isn’t funded by special interests. It’s true that he hasn’t accepted money from corporate PACs directly. But he has accepted money from PACs that do accept money from big corporations. He’s accepted money from special interest groups, such as labor PACs. And he has accepted direct contributions from corporate executives.  Cunningham’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. Clarification: This report has been updated to clarify why the statement is rated Mostly False.","[('Tweet by Cal Cunningham, candidate for US Senate in North Carolina.', 'https://twitter.com/CalforNC/status/1156536225597140992?s=20'), ('Email correspondence with Rachel Petri, spokeswoman for Cal Cunningham.', 'No link'), ('Campaign finance disclosures for Cal Cunningham filed with the Federal Election Commission.', 'https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00709410/1358882/'), ('Telephone interview with Brendan Quinn, outreach and social media manager at the Center for Responsive Politics.', 'No link'), ('Story by The Atlantic, ""Why So Many Democratic Candidates Are Dissing Corporate PACs,"" posted Aug. 23, 2018.', 'https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/why-so-many-democratic-candidates-are-ditching-corporate-pacs/568267/'), ('Story by Fortune Magazine, ""Democrats Keep Rejecting Corporate PAC Money.

Social posts revise the records of Sanders, Pelosi and Waters
","A viral post on Facebook tried to rewrite three Democratic lawmakers’ congressional records. The post, which was published Nov. 17 by the popular conservative page Trump Rules, includes photos of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Text written over the images claims the trio has not been very productive during their government careers. ""67 combined years. 6 bills passed,"" the post reads. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared thousands of times by several different users and pages. Like past social media posts, this one is inaccurate. (Screenshot from Facebook) Let’s look at the first claim — that Sanders, Pelosi and Waters have served a combined 67 years in Congress. Sanders was first elected to Congress in 1991 and has served as both a representative and senator. Pelosi was elected in 1987 and has served as both a representative and speaker of the House. Waters has served as a representative since 1991. When combined, the three lawmakers have served 88 years in Congress — actually more than the Facebook post claims. On the second claim, the Facebook post also falls flat. According to GovTrack, a website that keeps tabs on congressional legislation, the lawmakers mentioned in the post have passed more than six bills.  For this fact-check, we first used the most stringent definition of the word ""passed"" — legislation that is ""enacted,"" or signed by the president — to assess the validity of the post. Then we looked at how many sponsored bills had passed at least one chamber of Congress. Here is each lawmaker’s legislative record as of Nov. 17: Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Passed: 2 Enacted: 3 Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Passed: 9 Enacted: 7 Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. Passed: 23 Enacted: 3 That puts the lawmakers’ combined enacted bills at 13 — not six, as the Facebook post claimed. However, experts have told us that counting enacted bills is not the only nor the best way to measure lawmaker productivity. ""Very few bills are ever enacted — most legislators sponsor only a handful that are signed into law,"" reads a notice on the GovTrack site. ""But there are other legislative activities that we don’t track that are also important, including offering amendments, committee work and oversight of the other branches, and constituent services."" Additionally, Pelosi has served as House speaker for seven years, nonconsecutively. That role is more focused on setting the party’s agenda than actually introducing bills, according to GovTrack. The Facebook post is inaccurate.

Did Trump open a 'major Apple Manufacturing plant' in Austin? No.
","After a brief visit to Austin on Wednesday, President Donald Trump shared a tweet taking credit for opening an Apple Inc. manufacturing plant in the city. Trump toured a facility that manufactures Apple computers during his stop in Austin with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and his daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump. ""Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America,"" Trump said in a tweet after departing the city. ""Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn’t care about American Workers!"" In reality, the plant he toured has been manufacturing Apple’s Mac Pro computers for nearly six years. The tech giant considered shifting operations to China earlier this year but decided to stay put after receiving federal tariff exemptions. Also: Pelosi did not close Congress on Wednesday. The House approved a bill outlining U.S. support for activists in Hong Kong; and House lawmakers continued their impeachment hearings. The White House and Apple did not return requests for comment. Apple in Austin Apple has had a presence in Austin since 1992, and recent investments have turned the Texas capital into the company’s largest hub outside of its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. As Trump toured the production plant on Wednesday, Apple started construction on its $1 billion corporate campus in Austin, the latest expansion in the city. The campus will house a number of company operations, including engineering, research and development, operations, finance, sales and customer support, according to the Austin American-Statesman. It is expected to open in 2022 and have 5,000 employees. During his trip to Austin, Trump did not visit the new location nor will it be a manufacturing plant.  Mac Pro in Austin Apple has produced its Mac Pro desktop computers in Austin since 2013 at the Flextronics Americas factory in Northwest Austin. The computer has always been designed and engineered in California, and its components are produced in different states and other countries. Final assembly of the product happens in Austin, according to the company. In June, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple would move the manufacturing of its new Mac Pro models from Austin to China, citing capacity challenges at the Austin plant.  Another concern for the tech company was the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on Chinese goods, which were expected to affect imports of certain materials needed for the Mac Pro. The company asked the Trump administration in July to exclude from the tariffs components needed for its ""completely redesigned"" Mac Pro, according to Bloomberg. Days later, Trump shut down the request in a tweet: ""Apple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China. Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!""  But in September, the U.S. trade representative agreed to grant the exemption, and Apple announced that it would continue to use the Austin facility for Mac Pro assembly. The facility has about 500 workers and has been the company's only major device assemblage operation in the United States, according to Bloomberg. Most of Apple's products are produced and assembled in China.  Our Ruling Trump said: ""Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America.""  The Flextronics plant in Austin that Trump toured on Wednesday has produced Mac Pro computers since 2013. Earlier this year, Apple planned to shift assembly of the computer from Austin to China, but decided to keep operations in Austin after the Trump administration agreed to exemptions on import tariffs on goods from China needed for the computer.

Scott Walker sees big rise in health insurance premiums under Barack Obama
","As he explores a run for the White House, Gov Scott Walker has readily criticized President Barack Obama, a favorite punching bag for Republicans seeking to succeed him. On March 23, 2015, Walker turned to Twitter to complain about the rise in health insurance premiums since Obama took office.  Using a couple of abbreviations, he tweeted: ""Did you know that under Obama the avg cost of family HC premiums has increased by $4,154?"" We’ll look at the figure, as well as the implication that premium increases have been inordinately high since Obama took office. The figures, and the context Walker’s tweet included a link to a September 2014 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected source on health care. The report was about the foundation’s annual survey of private and non-federal public employers on the costs of employer-sponsored health benefits. The survey was done from January through May of 2014. Kaiser found that the average annual premium for family coverage was $16,834 in 2014. In Kaiser’s 2008 survey, the average was $12,680. So, the average increased by $4,154 -- the amount Walker claimed. But the earlier survey was done from January through May of 2008, when Republican George W. Bush was still president. Obama didn’t take office until January 2009. That makes it a bad starting point to use. In 2009, the average annual premium for family coverage was $13,375, according to Kaiser’s 2009 survey, which also was done in the January-May timeframe. That means the increase since Obama took office, from 2009 to 2014, was $3,459, not the $4,154 that Walker claimed. As for context for the figures, Kaiser found that from 2009 to 2014, the average family premium rose by 26 percent -- which it called ""significantly lower"" than the 34 percent growth in the previous five-year period, from 2004 to 2009. A final note: Two months before Walker made his claim, U.S. Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., made the same claim, also in a tweet and citing the same Kaiser report. PolitiFact Virginia rated her claim, Mostly False. That fits here. Our rating Walker said that under Obama, ""the average cost of family health care premiums has increased by $4,154."" The figure is correct when comparing 2008 to 2014 and using figures from a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected source on health care. But that includes a period before Obama took office in January 2009. The increase is less -- $3,459 -- when comparing 2009 to 2014. Moreover, despite the implication in Walker’s statement, the increase in average family premiums from 2009 to 2014 is less than it was the previous five years. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly False. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.","[('Twitter, Gov.

Taxpayers bore the cost of drawing proposed DeKalb cities' borders
","A border battle between two would-be cities in north-central DeKalb County took center stage in a lengthy House debate on Day 39 of the 40-day legislative session. Boundary disputes between the proposed cities of Lakeside and Tucker killed cityhood efforts last year. A House subcommittee brokered a compromise in December between Tucker and what was renamed LaVista Hills after the two sides again failed to agree on borders. The subcommittee’s chairman, Rep. Buzz Brockway, R-Lawrenceville, said at the time that the boundaries were ""set in stone."" But the Senate voted to move about 2,000 people and some commercial property out of Tucker and into LaVista Hills, setting up the tense House debate that saw subcommittee members successfully beat back the altered map. The two chambers eventually struck a deal to split the disputed territory between the two proposed cities. But in that House vote, speaking in the parlance of a floor debate, Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, D-Decatur, repeated commitments from the subcommittee. ""Isn’t it true that we were paid a per diem in December to resolve this dispute, to set this border in stone?"" Oliver asked. Traditional response dictates the response: If the lady so states. But what about her underlying point: Taxpayers funded a subcommittee’s work to hammer out borders of proposed cities when advocates couldn’t agree, only to see that public commitment nearly unravel in the waning days of the session. PolitiFact Georgia decided to find out. First, it’s important to understand how state legislators are compensated. The 180 members of the House and 56 members of the Senate earn $17,342 in annual salary for their service. They can also earn $173 a day for expenses such as lodging and meals, or up $6,920 for the annual legislative session. Despite being part-time lawmakers, their obligations don’t end when the gavel bangs to end the session. That’s why members also qualify for that $173 per diem any time in the ""off-season"" that they must take time off from work and travel for constituent services, to participate in regular committees, such as the busy Transportation Committee, and when serving on a special committee tasked with studying a particular policy area. Oliver was one of five members of the special House subcommittee charged with helping draw borders for the proposed DeKalb cities. The unusual thing about the subcommittee: It was the first time the full House set up such a group to help draw borders for new cities. And the full House agreed to abide by the subcommittee’s decision, as long as both cityhood groups did, too. Records show the subcommittee met Dec. 3 and Dec. 19 before voting during its second session to draw the borders. The deal also allowed the cityhood bills to advance in one year instead of the customary two years. ""Our agreement to allow a shortened process means this line is frozen,"" Brockway told WABE-FM (90.1) about the borders at the time. Representatives from both cityhood efforts agreed at the time to the deal. So, too, did House members. And records with the General Assembly Fiscal Office show the House members of the subcommitee did file for and earn per diems by registering their attendance with Brockway. Brockway and Oliver earned $173 each for the Dec. 3 session, as did state Reps. Barry Fleming, R-Harlem; Mark Hamilton. R-Cumming; and Howard Mosby, D-Atlanta. Per diem was paid again for the attendees of the Dec. 19 meeting: Brockway, Hamilton, Mosby and Oliver. The total per diems paid out for the two meetings, not including any mileage filed at 56 cents per mile, totaled $1,557. ""Our work was done in the public, as official work, and I don’t think it’s right to agree to change an act of a full subcommittee being paid to work,"" Oliver told PolitiFact Georgia after the House vote (but before the final deal). As the last-day deal shows, the two chambers were able to come to an agreement that divvied up the disputed area near Spaghetti Junction. Once the governor signs the bills, about 100,000 people will decide this fall on whether to form one or both cities. The debate about those boundaries nearly killed those votes for the second year in a row. Oliver said that taxpayers paid for lawmakers to work out a deal for both sides. State records back up that claim. We rate Oliver’s statement True.","[('Georgia General Assembly, 2015-2016 session, House Bill 520,\xa0', 'http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/20152016/151767.pdf'), ('State Rep.

George Will repeats debunked claim that Ronald Reagan created 1 million jobs in 1 month
","Disappointing job numbers -- 126,000 added jobs in March -- put the White House on the defensive and energized President Barack Obama’s critics. Conservative columnist George Will noted how poorly Obama stacks up against Republican icon Ronald Reagan. ""During the Reagan recovery there were 23 months of job creation over 300,000,"" Will said on Fox News Sunday. ""Reagan had a month of job creation of 1 million, and this was at a time when there were 75 million fewer Americans."" Will is correct that across President Reagan’s two terms, there were 23 months when the economy added over 300,000 jobs (the average monthly gain once the recovery took hold in March 1983 was about 250,000 jobs). But the focus of this fact-check is Will’s claim that Reagan oversaw a month when employment shot up by 1 million. Dave Weigel of Bloomberg Politics questioned Will’s claim, and we thought it was worth examining.   We emailed Will and his assistant and did not hear back by the time we published, but there can be only one month that Will had in mind. It is September 1983. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employer data showed 1.1 million more people getting paychecks in September than in August. This would be extraordinary except for one thing. On August 7, 1983, about 675,000 telephone workers went on strike. At the end of the month, they approved a contract and went back to work. In the interim, the Labor Department gathered its payroll data -- and, essentially, documented the effect of the strike. ""No doubt the striking workers returning to their jobs would have created a big bump in employment,"" said Doug Rossinow, a historian at Metropolitan State University in St. Paul, Minn., and author of The Reagan Era: A history of the 1980s. Put simply, the strike jangled the monthly job counts on both ends. It drove down the tally for August and pumped it up in September (and drove it back down for October). This graph using government data shows what happened:  The government’s September 1983 jobs report explicitly tied the 1.1 million spike to the labor dispute. ""Nonagricultural payroll employment rose by 735,000 in September,"" the report said. ""About 675,000 of this increase, however, represented the return of employees to payrolls following settlement of strikes, chiefly that of communications workers."" Newspapers were careful not to read too much into the big number. The New York Times wrote that the recovery was gaining ground with a rise of ""nearly 400,000, in the overall number of people employed."" The Labor Department did not count the striking workers as employed in August because they weren’t drawing a paycheck. But the jobs they had on Aug. 6, 1983, were waiting for them when they settled at the end of the month. The claim that 1.1 million new jobs were added in a single month has been debunked before, as recently as January 2015. Our ruling Will said Reagan created 1 million jobs in one month. The reality is that the jobs created by Reagan in 1983 were the result of a counting anomaly that started with a strike of telephone workers. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics rightly discounted the spike when it first reported it in 1983, as did news reports. Will should have, too. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.","[('Fox News, Fox News Sunday, April 5, 2015', 'http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/'), ('Business Insider, The Truth About September 1983, The Month Ronald Reagan Supposedly Created 1.1 Million Jobs, Jan. 17, 2015', 'No link'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, Data Retrieval: Employment, Hours, and Earnings: Table B-1', 'http://www.businessinsider.com/ronald-reagans-million-jobs-month-2015-1'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, The employment situation: August 1983, Sept. 2, 1983', 'No link'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, The employment situation: September 1983, Oct. 7, 1983', 'http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cesbtab1.htm'), ('New York Times, Telephone workers begin returning from strike, Aug. 29, 1983', 'No link'), ('New York Times, AT&T is struck by three unions, Aug. 7, 1983', 'https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/releases/bls/bls_employnews_198308.pdf'), ('New York Times, Joblessness falls to 18-month low as recovery gains, Oct. 8, 1983', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Joseph McCartin, professor, History Department, Georgetown University', 'https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/releases/bls/bls_employnews_198309.pdf'), ('Email interview, Doug Rossinow, professor, History Department, Metropolitan State University', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/apr/06/george-will/no-reagan-did-not-oversee-creation-1-million-jobs-/

In debate on school gun bill, a legislator says there have been 'zero' fatal school fires in U.S.
","By next school year, some school workers may be allowed to pack heat. A bill that has received approval by some legislative panels would allow superintendents to designate certain K-12 employees to carry concealed firearms. State Rep. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, a sponsor of the bill, said the measure makes a lot of sense considering school shootings of recent years. Here’s what he said during a Florida House judiciary committee hearing April 2: ""Right now our schools are required to do two or three fire drills a year. You know how many children in the history of the United States have died in a fire? Zero. You know how many have died because of a school shooting? Quite a few, but the state doesn’t require them to do any type of training. So this would require them to do, every year two times, school safety training as it relates to active shooters to work out these type of details that need to be worked out."" The committee voted in favor of the bill -- as did two other House panels in March. We were alerted to Steube’s statement about the lack of fatal school fires by Associated Press reporter Gary Fineout who tweeted about it. So we decided to check it out.   Data on school fires Steube told PolitiFact Florida that he ""definitely misspoke"" about school fires. ""I was talking about Florida,"" said Steube, who first proposed such legislation in 2013 after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. ""There has never been in the history of Florida a child who died in a school fire."" Steube said the point he was trying to make is that Florida schools are required to do fire drills, but not lockdown drills. (Staff analysis of the bill states that schools must develop procedures for hostage and weapons situations; Steube’s bill inserts language that requires schools to do drills for active shooter/hostage situations.) Some school districts already do lockdown drills including in Broward, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade Pasco and Pinellas counties. We drew information about fatal school fires from the National Fire Protection Association. The association lists school fires with 10 or more deaths. Most of the fires go back to the first half of the 20th century. We will summarize a few of the fires: Consolidated School in New London, Texas: This school fire has the largest number of fatalities documented by the association. A gas explosion in March 18, 1937, led to the deaths of 294 students and teachers at the school which was next to an oil refinery. A teacher turned on a sanding machine in an area filled with a mixture of gas and air, which set off the fire. ""Immediately the building seemed to lift in the air and then smashed to the ground. Walls collapsed. The roof fell in and buried its victims in a mass of brick, steel, and concrete debris,"" states history from a museum that memorializes the fire. Lakeview School in Collinwood, Ohio: A suburban Cleveland elementary school caught fire and killed 173 children and three adults on March 4, 1908. A furnace set fire to wooden supports, and the conflagration quickly spread throughout the building. Our Lady of the Angels school, Chicago: On Dec. 1 , 1958, fire broke out at the foot of a stairway in the school, killing 90 pupils and three nuns. A student smoking might have been the cause. Thankfully, those types of fires are no longer common due to modern safety standards. ""In recent years, the very few deaths that do occur in schools tend to be either adults or juvenile firesetters who set a fire in the school,"" said Marty Ahrens, who works for the association. In recent decades, the association has collected fire data through the federal government’s National Fire Incident Reporting System and its own survey. Between 2007-11, U.S. fire departments responded to an estimated average of 5,690 structure fires in educational properties including day cares, K-12 schools and colleges. These fires caused an annual average of 85 civilian fire injuries and $92 million in direct property damage.  In search of fires at schools in Florida Since Steube told us that he meant to say there had been no children who died in fires at Florida schools, we asked state experts if they could recall any. A spokeswoman for the state fire marshal said there were no fire-related fatalities in K-12 schools between 2000 and 2014, which includes all available incidents in the fire marshal’s database. We did find a case of a 4-year-old girl dying in a fire at a day care center in Tallahassee. A malfunctioning fan caused a fire at Stepping Stones child care center in Tallahassee in 2008. The day before the fire, a problem with a bathroom exhaust fan was noted on a repair sheet. A ""floater"" teacher assigned to the girl and her class that day had not yet been trained on what to do in a fire and was scheduled to be trained that day, the Tallahassee Democrat reported. We also found records of a dormitory fire in 1914 that killed six children and two staff members at the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys, the infamous reform school in Marianna (although that was a penal institution and not a traditional school).

Chain email: Secret Service pays the Clintons' mortgage
","Now that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is nearing the launch of her 2016 presidential campaign, old rumors are starting to resurface. A reader forwarded us a chain email he received that calls out Clinton and former President Bill Clinton for shady financial decisions. Versions of this same email first circulated in 2001 and again in 2008, during Hillary Clinton’s first presidential run. And now it’s back. The email reads, in part: Hillary Rodham Clinton, as a New York State Senator now comes under this fancy ""congressional retirement staffing plan"" which means that if she never gets re-elected, she STILL receives her Congressional salary until she dies. If Bill out-lives her, he then inherits HER salary until he dies. He is already getting his Presidential salary ($20,000 a month) until he dies. If Hillary out-lives Bill, she also gets HIS salary until she dies, Guess who pays for that? WE DO! Clinton's 20 Acre - $11 million mansion is common knowledge. For her to establish NY residency, they purchased this mansion in upscale Chappaqua, New York....makes sense. They are entitled to Secret Service protection for life. Still makes sense. Here is where it becomes interesting. Their mortgage payments are around $10,000/month. But an extra residence had to be built by the government on the acreage to house the Secret Service Agents. Any improvement to the property is owned by the property owners...the Clinton's. So....the Clinton's charge the federal government $10,000 monthly rent for the use of the extra residence to house the Secret Service staff which is just about equal to their mortgage payment. There’s a lot to unravel here. Is any of it true? Short answer: No. Pensions First, let’s look at whether Clinton will receive her congressional salary until she dies. Upon retiring, Clinton would receive benefits through the Federal Employee Retirement System, which would also cover her time as secretary of state. However, the pension for a member of Congress must not exceed 80 percent of the member’s final salary, according to law. So even if she received the highest pension possible, she wouldn’t be getting her full salary. In fact, in Clinton’s case, it would be much lower. Pension annuities for federal employees are calculated using length of career, a benefits accrual rate and an average of the employees’ highest three salaries. Clinton spent eight years in the Senate and about four years as secretary of state, where she made her highest salary of about $186,000. Her accrual rate would be 1.7 percent. We did the calculation, based on the formulas in a Congressional Research Service report, and found that she would actually earn a pension of about $41,000 -- about 25 percent of her salary as a senator. And would Bill Clinton get that pension if he outlives Hillary? No -- according to the federal Office of Personnel Management, he could receive a maximum of 50 percent of her pension. As for Bill Clinton’s presidential pension, he receives about $220,000 a year, which is about 75 percent of his presidential salary, after adjusting for inflation. Taxpayer-funded mortgage? The email also implies that tax dollars are paying for the Clintons’ mortgage at their house in Chappaqua, N.Y. As it turns out, this was one of the very first claims PolitiFact ever fact-checked back in 2007. We rated it False, but let’s run through it quickly one more time. As all former presidents, Bill Clinton is entitled to Secret Service detail for the rest of his life, including protection at his home. According to a Secret Service spokesman quoted in a 2001 Washington Post article, it is customary for the government to pay rent to the property owners in a situation like this. However, the Clintons declined that rent. Former White House Press Secretary Jake Siewert told the Washington Post that ""the Clintons are entitled to collect rent from the agency for space at their Chappaqua, N.Y., home but have declined the payments of about $1,100 a month."" When we looked at this in 2007, Hillary Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines said, ""They have not and do not receive money"" from the Secret Service. This time around, we asked current spokesman Nick Merrill, who said, ""this is the same as it used to be, nothing has changed since last time you reported this."" We should point out that the Clintons purchased their Chappaqua house in 1999 for $1.7 million, not $11 million as the email says. They also purchased it on a certain type of mortgage that required they pay back the entire amount within five years with monthly mortgage payments of about $8,000, according to the New York Times. Even if the Clintons got the $1,100 rent from the Secret Service, it would not have covered the size of their monthly mortgage. This is not to say the Clintons aren’t wealthy -- and they still receive a good amount of money from the government because of Bill Clinton’s presidency. But the claims in this email are in no way accurate. Our ruling A chain email said Hillary Clinton will receive her ""congressional salary until she dies"" and that the Secret Service pays her mortgage. Actually, a pension for a member of Congress cannot exceed 80 percent of the member’s last salary, according to law. Using federal employee retirement system formulas, Clinton’s retirement pension would likely work out to be about 25 percent of her congressional salary, about $41,000 a year. And while the Clintons are eligible to receive rent payments from the Secret Service -- who need space to operate at the Clintons’ house -- the rent amount would not have covered their mortgage payments. In any case, the Clintons do not accept these rent payments. We rate these claims Pants on Fire.","[('PolitiFact, ""The Clintons don\'t receive money from Secret Service,"" Oct. 20, 2007', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/20/chain-email/the-clintons-dont-receive-money-from-secret-servic/'), ('Snopes, ""Landlord of Misrule,"" 2001', 'No link'), ('FactCheck.Org, ""Secret Service Paying Clintons’ Mortgage?""

Advocacy group compares Gov. Pence to Jesus - unfavorably
","Indiana’s Religious Freedom law quickly turned into a political and economic minefield for Republican Gov. Mike Pence. One activist group, US Uncut, took the moment to cast Pence as a man who defended religion while acting in ways that fell short of Christian charity. It posted this image on its Facebook page, which has since been shared nearly 70,000 times, comparing Pence to Jesus:  We wanted to look at the claim that Pence provided ""zero state funding for homeless shelters."" The 2014 Indiana homeless population was 5,971, according to the state’s annual census. Of that population, officials counted 5,568 living in emergency shelters while 403 were found living on the street. Overall, the homeless count was down 12 percent from 2013, officials said. We looked at Pence’s most recent budget and found no money for emergency shelters. Under the line item for homelessness prevention, Pence requested zero dollars in both years of the biennial budget. There is $1.17 million in homeless assistance grants, but those are federal dollars. They come from the McKinney-Vento program administered through the Housing and Urban Development Department. There is also $1 million in mental health services for the homeless, but those too come from Washington. ""There has never been state funding directly for homeless shelters or programs,"" said Brad Meadows, communications director for the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority. Meadows added that towns and cities have the option to spend local money to care for the homeless. However, that would still not be state dollars. Barb Anderson is director of Haven House, a homeless shelter in Jeffersonville, Ind., and a long-time homeless advocate. ""We’ve tried to get state funding for shelters for over 25 years,"" Anderson told PunditFact. ""We’ve stayed open, but no one’s taken a salary in four years."" So Pence has not requested funding homeless shelters, but it’s worth noting that’s far from unique in Indiana. The state budget ultimately is the work product of the Legislature, not the governor. And the lack of state funding has been consistent under Republican and Democratic leadership. (Indiana had Democratic governors from 1989-2005, before electing Republican Mitch Daniels and then Pence.) Michael Stoops, director of community organizing with the advocacy group National Coalition for the Homeless, told PunditFact that Indiana follows the pattern of many rural and southern states. ""They are getting federal homeless dollars and passing them through to the cities and counties,"" Stoops said. ""They don’t spend any of their own money."" We contacted staff at Indiana University’s Public Policy Institute and the Indianapolis Coalition for Homelessness Intervention and Prevention, and they, too, could not identify any state money going toward emergency shelters. Indiana’s State Homeless Planning Council says on its webpage that the priority is on ""systematically preventing and ending homelessness for those most vulnerable in our communities."" The Council writes, ""Merely managing homelessness is in no one's best interest."" Stoops said many states do put their tax dollars into emergency shelters. That list includes, Colorado, Ohio, Oregon and Florida. ""Florida has been doing this since 1989,"" Stoops said. Our ruling The activist group US Uncut said Gov. Mike Pence provided zero state funding for homeless shelters. While the state budget and summaries from the experts and staffers we contacted confirmed that, it’s really an approach of the Indiana state government more than that of any particular person. Advocates say the state has never funded homeless shelters, a de facto policy that includes the consent of both the Legislature and former Democratic governors.

Susan Stimpson says Bill Howell tied to group seeking ""mixed-sex bathrooms"" in schools
","There’s little subtlety in the strategy guiding Susan Stimpson’s GOP primary challenge against House Speaker Bill Howell for his Stafford County seat. Stimpson, a Tea Party favorite and former chair of county’s board of supervisors, keeps saying Howell has lost his conservative moorings. A case in point is this headline Stimpson posted on her Facebook Page: ""BILL HOWELL is allied to group pushing MIXED SEX BATHROOMS in Stafford Schools."" Flushing out this claim requires two determinations: Is there a group seeking to establish unisex bathrooms in Stafford County schools and, if so; is Howell allied to it? Let’s get to work. The group Stimson’s claim springs from debate in Stafford over which bathrooms should be used by a transgender fourth-grader at Hartwood Elementary School. The student, who identifies as a female, had been allowed to use the girls’ restroom. That drew opposition from a parents’ group called Save Our Schools, who said their daughters were being required to use a bathroom with a boy. The county school board held a public hearing on March 24 and most of the speakers, according to the Free Lance-Star in nearby Fredericksburg, opposed the student using the girls’ bathroom. Later in the meeting, the board unanimously voted that the student must instead use either a single stall restroom at the school, a staff bathroom or the boys’ restroom. What about the group that Stimpson says was ""pushing mixed sex bathrooms in Stafford County schools?"" Stimpson’s campaign told us she was referring to Equality Virginia, an advocacy organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transexual Virginians. Before the vote, Virginia Lambeck, Equality Virginia’s program director, emailed Stafford school board members, urging them to adopt a countywide policy that would allow transgender students to chose which bathrooms to use. Lambeck attached model policies drafted by the Gay Lesbian & Straight Education Network and the Massachusetts Department of Education. James Parrish, Equality Virginia’s executive director, emailed us that allowing transgender students to use the restrooms of their preference makes schools more welcoming to them. ""Transgender children, like all children, are balancing academic requirements with extracurricular activities and a social life, they are managing relationships with parents, teachers, and friends, and they are thinking about their future"" he wrote. ""Being stigmatized for who they are should not be part of any child’s growing up."" Now, let’s move on to the speaker. Is Howell ""allied"" with Equality Virginia? Stimpson’s campaign says Howell’s PAC -- Dominion Leadership Trust -- accepted $6,000 in contributions from Equality Virginia from 2006 through 2012 and that the speaker has supported the LGBT group on some key issues. Howell’s PAC did indeed receive $6,000 from the group during that span, according to records from the Virginia Public Access Project. It should be noted that Equality Virginia hasn’t given anything to the  speaker’s PAC since 2012. For perspective, Howell’s PAC collected almost $11.8 million from 2006 through 2014. Equality Virginia’s donations account for 1/20th of 1 percent of that sum. As for Howell’s voting record, Rollin Reisinger, Stimpson’s campaign manager emailed us that  ""Howell may not support everything on Equality Virginia's agenda, but he has been an ally on certain issues."" He cited two instances: In 2013, Howell voted to appoint an openly gay judge, Tracy Thorne-Begland, to the Richmond Manchester General District Court. Earlier this year, legislation that would have allowed the speaker to a hire a lawyer to defend a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and woman died in the House Rules Committee, which Howell chairs. Individual votes were not recorded. Howell supported a similar measure to protect the marriage amendment in 2014 when Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat, said he would not defend challenges to it.   Equality Virginia offers a different take on Howell. Its legislative scorecard says Howell opposed its agenda on six of eight issues in 2012 and 2013. Howell, for example: Voted for a successful bill that allows private adoption and foster agencies to bypass prospective LGBT parents on grounds of religious or moral convictions.. Voted against unsuccessful legislation that would have prevented LGBT children from being placed in foster homes where the parents believe that ""being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender is a behavior rather than an in-born, immutable characteristic."" We should note that Equality Virginia did not publish a House scorecard in 2014. That’s because almost all of the bills on its agenda were killed in committees and never reached the floor. The group faced the same results this year. ""Similar to previous years, despite all our hard work, it’s disappointing – but not surprising –  to see the House of Delegates stand in the way to creating a welcoming and inclusive Virginia,"" the group said in its 2015 legislative wrap-up. Parrish, the executive director of Equality Virginia, said his group used to give money to Howell’s PAC because it wanted to contribute to both political parties -- a strategy frequently used by special interests. The speaker, he added, has not responded with kindness. ""While it would be great to have support from the House leadership on our issues, Speaker Howell has not done anything to assist Equality Virginia with our legislative agenda of seeking fairness and equality for LGBT Virginians,"" Parrish said in a prepared statement. Matthew Moran, a spokesman for Howell, offered the same sentiment. ""Under (Howell’s) leadership, the House has defeated nearly every single one of Equality Virginia’s legislative priorities,"" he emailed. As for the transgender bathroom issue, Moran said Howell discussed the matter with Stafford school board members before the vote and ""supports their decision 100 percent.""  Our ruling Stimpson wrote ""BILL HOWELL is allied to group pushing MIXED SEX BATHROOMS in Stafford schools."" Equality Virginia unsuccessfully advocated allowing transgender students in Stafford to use the restrooms of their choice. Stimpson’s statement makes it sound like the LGBT group wanted a broad policy that would have allowed all students of either sex to use the same bathrooms. That’s not the case. When proposed, the debate focused on one fourth-grader at one school. The connection between Equality Virginia and Howell is equally tenuous. The group made annual donations totaling $6,000 to Howell’s multi-million dollar PAC from 2006 to 2012. What Stimpson omits is that Equality Virginia has not contributed to the PAC in more than two years. The group decided, well in advance of restroom issue, that Howell was unfriendly to LGBT issues and now says Howell ""has not done anything to assist"" it. So any small comity that once may have existed between the speaker and Equality Virginia is certainly dead. We rate Stimpson’s statement False.","[('Susan Stimpson Facebook post, March 28, 2015.', 'https://www.facebook.com/EqualityVA?fref=nf'), ('Email from Rollin Reisinger, campaign manager for Susan Simpson, March 31, 2015.', 'No link'), ('Emails from Kirsten Bokenkamp, spokeswoman for Equality Virginia, March 31 and April 1, 2015.', 'http://www.staffordcountysun.com/education/article_098b1d46-d303-11e4-a1c9-bf5189bad658.html'), ('Email from Matthew Moran, spokesman for House Speaker William Howell, April 3, 2015.', 'No link'), ('Equality Virginia Facebook page, March 25, 2015.', 'http://www.fredericksburg.com/news/education/stafford-schools-reverse-restroom-stance-for-transgender-student/article_5b083186-d2a9-11e4-9b1d-2ffa10528634.html'), ('The Stafford County Sun, ""School board changes approach to transgender issue,"" March 25, 2015.', 'No link'), ('The Free Lance-Star, ""Stafford schools reverse restroom stance for transgender student,"" March 25, 2015.', 'http://www.fredericksburg.com/news/local/stafford/transgender-student-in-stafford-school-sparks-debate/article_821ab53e-1ea4-5cbd-b5d7-96ec5529261b.html'), ('The Free Lance-Star, ""Transgender student in Stafford school sparks debate,"" March 24, 2015.', 'No link'), ('Video of the Stafford County School Board’s March 24, 2015 meeting.

Forbes says U.S. among few nations without an offical language
","What’s the official language of the United States? If you said English, you haven’t read U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes’ blog lately. ""Did you know that the U.S. is one of the very few nations in the world without an official language?"" Forbes, R-4th, wrote. We put the congressman’s claim to the test. Forbes’ office referred us to the CIA, which publishes ""The World Factbook,"" a website of data on 240 nations, territories and regions. Among other things, it lists the languages spoken in each of the places and whether its government has sanctioned an official tongue. The CIA says that while 82 percent of people in the U.S. usually speak in English, our nation ""has no official language."" Forbes wants to change that. He’s among 31 cosponsors of a bill that would declare English the official language of the U.S. and require the federal government to transact just about all of its activities in English. Similar legislation has died in Congress in recent years. The practical effects of the legislation may be slim. We asked a representative of U.S. English, a group lobbying for an official language, how the bill would change the way government now operates. Matthew Shuman, the group’s manager of government relations, was hard pressed to come up with concrete examples. He said the bill would generally ease pressure on agencies to voluntarily help non-English speakers and that, in return, would improve efficiency. Many supporters find high symbolic value in the legislation. Efforts in recent decades to establish official English are tied to concerns about growing levels of immigration into the U.S., according to a 2010 report by the Congressional Research Service. Forbes, a critic of President Barack Obama’s immigration policies, blogged, ""As a nation of immigrants created by a common thread of language, it is important that we protect the unity that the English language affords us."" Opponents say the official English movement stigmatizes of people who are legally present in the U.S. but do not speak English in their homes. While the U.S. doesn’t have a sanctioned language, 31 states -- including Virginia -- have laws establishing English their official tongue. Virginia’s law, passed in 1996, says ""no state agency or local government shall be required to provide...any documents, information, literature or any other written materials in any language other than English."" There’s one piece of work left here. Forbes’ statement also says the U.S. is among few nations with no official language. So we need to spin the globe. There are 196 nations, according to infoplease.com, an online almanac. The CIA lists no official language for 14 of them. Aside from the U.S., they are American Samoa, Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Holy See, Iceland, Jamaica, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Mexico, San Marino and the United Kingdom.

Gov. Scott Walker says he bought a sweater for $1 at Kohl's
","When Gov. Scott Walker took his presidential ambitions to New Hampshire, he shared a penny-pinching story that would have been right at home in bargain-hunting Wisconsin. At the center of the story: A new sweater, a dollar and Menomonee Falls-based Kohl’s. The department store chain is well known for its deep discounts -- ones so deep that the company has faced legal challenges over its pricing practices in Kansas, Massachusetts and California. At issue in the California case, for instance, was complaints that the retailer listed ""normal"" prices for products but never sold them for that price. Walker likes to point out that shortly after he was married, his wife, Tonette, was mortified because he didn’t know the drill at Kohl’s. In Concord, N.H., he told the crowd at a March 14, 2015 workshop about a ""critical mistake"" he made while shopping at a Kohl’s store. ""I went to a Kohl's department store and I bought something for the price it was marked at,"" Walker said, adding that he’s now been ""trained well"" about how to shop at Kohl’s. So well that he pointed to the brownish-colored sweater he was wearing and declared: ""We paid one dollar for it with our Kohl’s Cash."" A buck? Now, we grant this is not the most important topic in politics today. But we decided to fact check it for two reasons. First, we heard from readers from around the country who thought it was an unbelievable story -- as in, literally impossible to believe. Second, it goes to what has been a major theme of Walker’s visits to some of the early primary states -- that he is just an average guy. In Wisconsin, voters have long heard about Walker’s brown bag lunches and his ham-and-cheese sandwiches have become a fixture on his Twitter account. At the presidential level, all of this becomes a pointed contrast his far-better heeled GOP rivals, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. When we asked a spokeswoman for Walker’s exploratory campaign group, Our American Revival, about the $1 sweater, we didn’t receive a response. So we did what any Midwesterner would do, and went bargain hunting. Could we score a sweater just like the nifty henley that Walker donned in New Hampshire? And, more importantly, could we do it for next to nothing? Walker indicated on Twitter that he bought the sweater while in the Granite State. He didn’t identify the location, but there is a Kohl’s in Hooksett, about 13 miles from Concord. We called the store, and an employee in menswear said all of the store’s henley sweaters were mixed with other items on clearance racks. Based on photos of Walker in the sweater, it appears to be a ""Chaps Twisted Button Mock Sweater"" in a color called ""walnut twist."" We couldn’t find that sweater available on the Kohl’s web site, so we visited the Kohl’s store in Glendale to paw through the clearance racks. There we found plenty of Chaps sweaters marked between 80 and 90 percent off -- an even deeper cut than the 70% Walker cited when describing the deal. Some of the sweaters we found were originally priced at $70 and marked down to $7. Now, that’s not $1. But Walker did say he used his ""Kohl’s Cash"" -- a coupon of sorts that is generated based on how much a customer purchased in an earlier visit to the store. Thus, he could have easily gotten one for $1 out-of-pocket. We rate the claim True. Now, just ask us how much Walker’s daily ham sandwich costs.","[('Video, Scott Walker appearance in Concord, N.H., March 14, 2015', 'http://www.wmur.com/politics/raw-video-scott-walker-speaks-in-concord/31797362'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""In New Hampshire, Scott Walker talks troop deployment to fight Islamic State,"" March 14, 2015', 'No link'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Kohl’s loses appeal in California false-advertising lawsuit,"" May 30, 2013', 'http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-scales-up-likely-presidential-operation-in-new-hampshire-b99462039z1-296315421.html'), ('The Boston Globe, ""In N.H., Scott Walker stresses humble roots,"" March 14, 2015', 'No link'), ('ABC News, ""Wisconsin Gov.

Would Wisconsin voters no longer decide who leads the state Supreme Court?
","Wisconsin voters are being asked in the April 7, 2015 election whether to amend the state constitution to change how the chief justice of the Supreme Court is chosen. Which raises the question: Do most voters even know how the selection is made? After all, the office of chief justice is never on the ballot. Currently, the justice who has served longest on the high court is automatically made chief, and remains in that role as long as he or she is on the court. That process has been in place since an amendment was made to the state constitution in 1889. With the referendum, voters decide to keep the seniority system, or instead have the justices choose a chief from among themselves, every two years. The liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee, through a group it created called Make Your Vote Count, released a radio ad on March 30, 2015 that urges a vote against the change. The ad is narrated by Janine Geske, a Marquette University law professor who served on the high court from 1993 to 1998. ""For 125 years, it's been the votes of the people of Wisconsin determining who serves as chief justice. After all, it’s the people of Wisconsin who elect the Supreme Court,"" Geske says at the start. She adds near the end: ""Our democracy and your vote are threatened by a referendum April 7th that takes the choice of chief justice away from the people."" So, is the Greater Wisconsin Committee right -- would the referendum take ""the choice of chief justice"" of the Supreme Court ""away from the people,"" when the voters don’t directly elect a chief justice? Political backdrop The state high court has seven justices. Voters elect them to 10-year terms in non-partisan spring elections. (Justice Ann Walsh Bradley is running for re-election against Rock County Circuit Judge James Daley on April 7.) Sometimes, a justice gets on the court by being appointed by the governor to fill a vacancy, but then he or she must run for election. On the surface, the referendum would merely change the process for deciding which justice has administrative control of the court. But if it passes, it would also have, as the radio ad notes and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported, political implications. The conservative majority on the court likely would replace Shirley Abrahamson, the court’s leading liberal, as chief justice. Referendum So, do the voters choose the chief justice? Abrahamson’s example helps sort it out -- though it's important to note she is an exception, having been a member of the Wisconsin Supreme Court longer than anyone. Abrahamson was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1976, then won election in 1979 and was re-elected in 1989. She ascended to chief in 1996 when she became the court’s most senior member. When voters subsequently re-elected Abrahamson to the court in 1999 and 2009, they ensured that, as the longest-tenured justice, she would remain the chief. The Greater Wisconsin Committee argues that the voters who re-elected Abrahamson wanted her to remain as chief justice. But there's no way to know how many felt that way, since there was no actual vote on who would be chief. Some voters might have simply favored Abrahamson over her election opponent for a seat on the court, but may not necessarily have wanted her to be chief justice. It's also worth noting that Abrahamson aside, under the current system, voters often don't get to vote for, or against, a sitting chief justice. Here’s a look at the chief justices going back for two decades before Abrahamson became chief, based on ""Portraits of Justice,"" a book published by the Wisconsin Historical Society Press. Chief Justice Time on Supreme Court as chief justice Number of times sought re-election while chief Roland Day 1995-1996 0; retired from court in 1996 Nathan Heffernan 1983-1995 1; retired from court in 1995 Bruce Beilfuss 1976-1983 0; retired from court in 1983 Horace Wilkie 1974-1976 0; died in 1976 So that history undermines the idea that voters get much of a say in terms of who is chief justice. Given her longevity, some 19 years as chief, Abrahamson is an unusual case. Our rating The Greater Wisconsin Committee said an April 7, 2015 referendum would take ""the choice of chief justice"" of the Wisconsin Supreme Court ""away from the people."" Voters elect the Supreme Court justices, but they don’t get to vote for chief justice. Currently, the justice who has served longest is automatically made chief justice. If the chief comes up for re-election for a seat on the court, voters can, in effect, make that person the chief for 10 more years by re-electing him or her to a new 10-year term. However, often voters never get such an opportunity. A justice becomes chief by virtue of seniority, but may then leave the court altogether before facing re-election, as has occurred several times in recent history prior to Abrahamson. For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.","[('WisPolitics.com, radio ad from Greater Wisconsin Committe’s Make Your Vote Count, March 30, 2015', 'http://www.wispolitics.com/1006/150330Response.mp3'), ('Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, constitutional amendment brief, January 2015', 'No link'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Groups decry chief justice referendum,"" March 23, 2015', 'http://gab.wi.gov/sites/default/files/page/65/legislative_reference_bureau_paper_on_electing_chi_13874.pdf'), ('Wisconsin State Journal, ""Business group bankrolling ‘yes’ vote in Supreme Court referendum,"" March 31, 2015', 'No link'), ('Interview, Greater Wisconsin Committee executive director Rich Judge, March 31, 2015', 'http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/297272861.html'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Supreme Court amendment is about good government,"" March 30, 2015', 'No link'), ('Wausau Daily Herald, ""How not to choose a chief justice,"" March 30, 2015', 'http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/business-group-bankrolling-yes-vote-in-supreme-court-referendum/article_b7ed409e-a67c-5ea8-b027-1a73126ff083.html'), ('Wisconsin Historical Society Press, ""Portraits of Justice,"" 2003', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/apr/03/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/would-wisconsin-voters-no-longer-decide-who-leads-/

Tim Cook did not promise Apple boycott of Indiana
","Some social conservatives have had it with backlash directed at Indiana over its Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In a column for conservative grassroots site RedState.com, editor-in-chief Erick Erickson criticized business owners and people on the left who say the law will allow anyone to cite religious belief in refusing to serve gays and lesbians. Erickson’s opening sentence hones in on Apple chief executive Tim Cook for what he sees as hypocritical business practices. ""To recap: Tim Cook (please, please click this link) and the left are happy to do business in countries that stone to death or otherwise jail gay people, but will not do business with Indiana,"" Erickson wrote, ""which merely passed a law insisting that the ‘free exercise’ clause of the first amendment be on the same legal footing in courts as the ‘free speech’ clause of the first amendment."" Erickson would not respond to our requests for more information, but his point is fairly evident: Apple will do business in countries where being gay is illegal (there were more than 70 such countries as of 2013) but won’t do business with Indiana. That turns out to be putting words in Apple’s mouth. What Cook said Cook, who has been Apple’s CEO since 2011, started speaking out against Indiana’s religious freedom law with a couple of tweets March 27, the day after Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed the measure into law.  Cook wasn’t done criticizing the law. In a March 29 Washington Post op-ed, Cook, who is gay, warned that the legislation in Indiana and other states allows people to cite personal religious beliefs as a reason not to serve a customer based on sexual orientation. (Some experts say such refusals along these lines under Religious Freedom Restoration Acts would not win out in court, but the law may lead some people to think they have that right.) ""Our message, to people around the country and around the world, is this: Apple is open,"" he wrote. ""Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love. Regardless of what the law might allow in Indiana or Arkansas, we will never tolerate discrimination."" Cook also said, ""on behalf of Apple, I’m standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation — wherever it emerges."" Strong words, yes. But like his tweets, the op-ed said nothing about the company no longer doing business with Indiana. We searched and found no other instance of Cook, or Apple, making comments about Indiana’s law or suggesting they would not do business in, or with, the state. Erickson did not respond to us via our email, phone or Twitter queries. Instead, he posted a blog on RedState saying ""Seriously. Sometimes a tweet is just a tweet."" (Erickson’s post was not a tweet, it was a column.) Erickson isn’t alone among bloggers in the right-wing blogosphere who hold up the company’s Middle East presence in criticizing the CEO’s stance toward Indiana. Apple has locations in predominantly Muslim countries where some states or sects under sharia law punish homosexuality with death, including Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Qatar. As for Indiana, the state is home to two Apple retail stores in malls in Indianapolis and Mishawaka. Both were still in operation April 2, 2015, when we called. An Apple spokesman offered no additional comment. Our ruling In trying to call out Apple’s Cook for clashing business practices over gay rights, Erickson said Cook ""will not do business with Indiana.""   That is not true based on Cook’s public remarks on Twitter and in an op-ed. Cook has been outspoken in his position against the law and others like it across the country, but Apple stores remain open in Indiana and iPhones, iMacs and everything else is still being sold.

Checking Bernie Sanders on Americans' low voter-turnout rates
","Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and is considering running for president, recently decried the lack of Americans participating in the electoral process during a town hall at a union hall in Austin, Texas. During an appearance at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers-sponsored town hall on March 31, 2015, Sanders told the audience: ""I beg of you do not enter that world of despair. We can win this fight. In order to win this struggle we are going to need nothing less than a political revolution, and let me tell you what I mean by ‘a political revolution.’ When, as was the case in this last election in November, when 63 percent of the American people chose not to vote, when 80 percent of young people, when 75 percent of low-income workers, chose not to vote, what we need to do is create a momentum so that 70, 80, 90 percent of the people vote. And when that happens, we win hands down."" It's a longstanding concern for Sanders, who has introduced a bill to make Election Day a national holiday so more people can vote. We wondered: Was Sanders right about the low level of voter participation? First, let’s look at the numbers. • ""63 percent of the American people chose not to vote."" Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist, has assembled the United States Election Project, an extensive and widely used archive of voter participation data. He found that in the November 2014 general election, 33.2 percent of the voting-age population cast a ballot and 35.9 percent of the voting-eligible population voted. The difference between those two figures is that the voting-age population includes non-citizens and felons, neither of which are able to vote, whereas the voting-eligible population excludes these groups. If you flip the numbers so they are expressed as Sanders used them, 66.8 percent of the voting-age population didn’t vote, and 64.1 percent of the voting-eligible population didn’t vote. Using the latter figure -- which political scientists consider a better measurement -- Sanders is quite close. Incidentally, according to McDonald’s data, the overall turnout rate in 2014 was the lowest since World War II. • ""80 percent of young people"" did not vote. We found a study conducted by the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University that had some relevant data for voters age 18-29. It estimated a turnout rate for that age group of 21.5 percent. That works out to a 78.5 percent non-participation rate -- close to the 80 percent Sanders cited. • ""75 percent of low-income workers chose not to vote."" This is the claim for which Sanders has the weakest support. After each election cycle is over, the Census Bureau looks back at how many Americans of different demographic groups voted. The data isn’t yet compiled for the 2014 election, so we looked instead at the 2010 election -- the most recent midterm election prior to 2014. (In general, presidential-year elections see higher turnout across the board than midterms do, so using 2010 offers the best apples-to-apples comparison for 2014.) According to the 2010 data, those earning less than $30,000 a year -- the cutoff Sanders’ office told us he was using -- had a turnout rate of either 28.9 percent (if you use total population) or 34.6 percent (if you use citizens only). Flip those and you get 65 percent of citizens in that income category not voting, or 71 percent of everyone in that income category not voting. Those are both lower than Sanders’ claim of 75 percent, and for the more salient statistic -- citizens alone -- it’s off by a full 10 percentage points. (Jeff Frank, a Sanders spokesman, acknowledged that the statement was an estimate.) We should note that political scientists say that the census data may overstate actual voting rates, since it’s based on what respondents tell researchers, and there’s a widespread assumption that people over-report socially admired actions like voting. So it’s possible that Sanders’ 75 percent figure is closer to accurate. However, saying so requires speculating beyond the hard figures. To sum up, then: On the numbers, Sanders is quite close for turnout rates among Americans overall and among young people, but he’s a bit off for turnout rates for lower-income Americans. Did all of these people 'choose not to vote'? However, there’s another wrinkle to what Sanders said. Sanders twice used the phrasing ""chose not to vote."" In the same Census Bureau survey we mentioned earlier, researchers asked for the reason why people didn’t vote. It’s broken down by age and income, so we can check all three of Sanders’ claims against the data for 2010. We divided the stated reasons for not voting into two categories -- reasons of circumstance and reasons of choice. Under reasons of circumstance, we included ""illness or disability,"" ""out of town,"" ""too busy/conflicting schedule,"" ""transportation problems,"" ""registration problems,"" ""bad weather conditions,"" and ""inconvenient polling places."" Under reasons of choice, we included ""forgot to vote,"" ""not interested,"" and ""did not like candidates or campaign issues."" (We ignored ""other"" and ""didn’t know."") Our division is not infallible -- others can combine the reasons into their own categories -- but we think our calculation offers a useful starting point for comparison. All three demographic groups Sanders mentioned turn out to have pretty similar breakdowns. For Americans overall, 55 percent didn’t vote for reasons of circumstance. For young Americans, it was 56 percent, and for low-income Americans, it was 52 percent. By contrast, the percentages of people not voting by choice were lower across the board. For Americans overall, it was 33 percent. For young Americans, it was 30 percent and for lower-income Americans it was 34 percent. This means that Sanders went too far when he said that large majorities chose not to vote. ""It would be true to say that roughly an estimated 80 percent of youth did not vote in the 2014 midterm,"" said Abby Kiesa, youth coordinator and researcher at the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement. ""However, the existing research about youth voting does not suggest that all of those youth actively chose not to vote. In fact, young people in particular face barriers such as navigating a new system, that may prevent them from registering and voting, even if they do want to vote."" This may have been an unintentional word choice on Sanders’ part, but at PolitiFact we pay close attention to speakers’ precise wording. Class differences in voting A final note: Sanders may have gotten some of his numbers wrong, but he does have a point that poorer Americans vote at lower rates than rich Americans do, as do younger Americans. ""There is a class bias in voting,"" said Sean McElwee, a research associate with the think tank Demos. In 2010, for instance, the Census Bureau found that as 34.6 percent of citizens making below $30,000 were voting, a much higher percentage of those earning at least $150,000 voted -- 59 percent. Even taking into account the caveats in the data, McElwee said, ""this is a disturbing gap."" Our ruling Sanders said that ""in this last election in November, ... 63 percent of the American people chose not to vote, ... 80 percent of young people, (and) 75 percent of low-income workers chose not to vote."" Sanders was too loose with some of his numbers and his wording, but he has a point that rates of non-voting among Americans, and especially among younger and poorer Americans, are high. We rate the claim Half True.","[('Bernie Sanders, comments at a town hall in Austin, Texas, March 31, 2015 (recorded by PolitiFact Texas)', 'http://www.electproject.org/2014g'), ('United States Elections Project, ""2014 November General Election Turnout Rates,"" Updated Dec. 30, 2014', 'No link'), ('Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University, ""21.5% Youth Turnout: Two-Day Estimate Comparable to Recent Midterm Years,"" Updated Nov. 6, 2014', 'http://www.civicyouth.org/21-3-youth-turnout-preliminary-estimate-comparable-to-recent-midterm-years/'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, ""Table 10.

School uniforms improve school safety and truancy, Rep. Janet Adkins says
","More Florida school districts may soon have millions of reasons to start requiring students to wear uniforms, thanks to a bill that just passed the House. Rep. Janet Adkins, R-Fernandina Beach, sponsored a bill that would give districts $10 per child to adopt standard attire policies in kindergarten through eighth grade. The state would set aside $10 million in all from the general revenue fund. Similar provisions have been amended to a school bill in the Senate, although without the cash incentive. Adkins said that school uniforms help create a positive learning environment, because it removes distractions. She cited testimony from officials from five Florida school districts that raved about their uniform policies. ""They were all saying the same thing, and that is when they implemented a school uniform policy in their schools, the climate, the culture at their schools improved,"" Adkins said. ""It's an issue of school safety, helps with school truancy."" The House passed the bill 102-8 on March 27, but we were curious whether requiring students to dress the same really did improve school safety and truancy records. Turns out the research is anything but uniform. Dressing up stats Adkins’ bill would not make uniforms mandatory in any district, although there are already five counties that do have at least a district-wide K-8 standard student attire policy, according to a House analysis. Those five are Alachua, Bay, Madison, Osceola and Polk counties. Otherwise the decision to require uniforms filters down to varying degrees at the local level, even school by school. Whether or not the practice makes students safer or fosters better attendance really comes down to what study you read. A 1996 study of Long Beach, Calif., schools found a marked decrease in fights, sexual violence and weapons possession two years after adopting school uniforms. A different take on the issue from 2007 using national data found average assaults had actually gone up by an average of 14 incidents in violent schools that required standard attire. One researcher we spoke with said that a big part of uniform policies is the perception they make schools safer. Jafeth Sanchez, a research assistant professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, said surveys she gave students at three middle schools showed the kids felt like uniforms curbed violence, although that feeling dropped in the second year students were asked. (Adkins’ office directed us to this study as proof of her statement, but said she used a couple of others, as well.) Those results could be because the students got used to wearing uniforms. Or, it could be because the initial answers weren’t honest, but Sanchez thought that was unlikely. ""Generally, students do respond honestly to such things – particularly considering that the majority indicated they didn’t like wearing uniforms, even though they actually agreed or strongly agreed with their various benefits,"" she said. Other experts we interviewed said there was a kind of ""halo effect"" in which students and teachers felt things had improved, even if they hadn’t. Research into attendance is another matter, and often the two subjects aren’t studied at the same time. A Youngstown State University study from 2006 looked at Ohio secondary schools and found attendance and graduation rates clearly went up. University of Houston researchers checked into attendance in 2010 and found the difference was slight. ""Specifically attendance rates in middle and high schools increased by approximately ½ to 1 day per year. There was no impact on elementary attendance,"" according to Scott Imberman, who worked on the University of Houston research and now teaches economics at Michigan State. He added it is difficult to measure discipline stats along with uniform implementation because discipline standards may have changed along with the dress code. And some argue school uniforms are an all-around boondoggle. David Brunsma, a sociology professor at Virginia Tech, has studied the issue and wrote a 2004 book called The School Uniform Movement and What It Tells Us about American Education: A Symbolic Crusade. His research from national samples found no significant effects on behavior, absenteeism or student attitudes. ""This is classic,"" he told PolitiFact Florida via email. ""However, it is based on misinformation, common (non)sense, and, of course, pressure from the children’s clothier industry."" Our ruling Adkins said school uniforms improve school safety and truancy. There are some studies that say there are changes for the better and worse for both school violence and attendance statistics once uniforms are adopted, but there’s hardly a consensus. Even if there is improvement, research suggests the positives are slight -- not exactly the evidence Adkins says overwhelmingly supports the benefits of these policies. Some experts think the actual impact on students is negligible or even negative. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.","[('WJXT/Capitol News Service, ""Florida legislation encourages school uniforms,"" March 26, 2015', 'http://www.news4jax.com/news/florida-legislation-encourages-school-uniforms/32032930'), ('California State University, Long Beach, ""School Uniforms and Safety,"" 1996', 'No link'), ('Youngstown State University, ""School Uniforms in Urban Public High Schools,"" November 2005', 'http://eus.sagepub.com/content/28/4/424.refs'), ('Southwest Journal of Criminal Justice, ""Do School Violence Policies Matter?

Sally Kohn: 'White men account for 69 percent of those arrested for violent crimes'
","Recent incidents of overt racism and abuse of women at college fraternities led liberal columnist Sally Kohn to comment that the press and the public fail to grasp the threat of violence from white men. ""Although the news media and popular culture constantly cast suspicion on young Muslim and African-American men and the supposedly disproportionate and ever-present threats these communities pose, the fact is young white men are just as dangerous,"" Kohn wrote in a CNN opinion piece. ""But because our biases have us so busy looking the other way, we're ignoring the magnitude of this reality."" Kohn went on and offered some statistics to bolster her point. Among them was this line: ""Although black men are more than six times more likely to be sent to prison than white men, white men account for 69 percent of those arrested for violent crimes."" A reader asked us to look into the statistic that white men account for 69 percent of those arrested for violent crimes. Correcting Kohn’s numbers Kohn’s claim about 69 percent of white men runs into trouble on two counts. The figure she cited is not for white men. It’s for all whites. And it’s not for ""violent"" crimes. It’s for all crimes, from loitering to murder. It’s not simple to replicate the percentage of white men arrested for violent crimes, as we’ll show you in a bit. But we can look at violent crimes, sorted solely by race.  According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, white men and women were arrested for 60 percent of all violent crimes in 2012. Violent crimes include murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Here’s the arrest data: All races Whites (incl. Hispanics) Blacks (incl. Hispanics) Murder and Nonnegligent Manslaughter 10,351 4,955 5,138 Forcible Rape 15,571 10,038 5,030 Robbery 82,189 38,041 42,460 Aggravated Assault 352,017 223,426 116,984 Total 460,128 276,460 169,612 Percent 100% 60.1% 36.9% Population 240.165 million 192.319 million 30.971 million Source: Bureau of Justice Statistics, Arrest Data Analysis Tool Drilling down on the number of crimes committed by whites who are also male is more challenging. Federal data allows you to sort on race and sex, but not both at the same time. The exception is for homicides. While you won’t find that information on the Justice Department website, it can be culled from federal records, which is what James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, has done for many years. Fox sent us the following homicide arrest numbers: Year Race Sex Reported Percent Rate per 100K 2012 White Male 4,631 41.5% 4.9 2012 Black Male 5,095 45.6% 35.2 2013 White Male 4,486 41.7% 4.7 2013 Black Male 4,863 45.2% 33.0 Source: James Alan Fox  (The percentages are based on all homicide arrests, not just the ones you see in the table.) Looking solely at murders, black men are arrested more for murder than white men, and at a much higher rate when you account for population. We can’t draw conclusions beyond that, however, because the arrest data simply doesn’t allow us to draw firm conclusions about the number of arrests for violent crimes by white and black men. We should note that data show that the majority of black murder victims are murdered by blacks, and the same holds true for whites. There are other caveats. The arrest data blends Hispanic offenders into both the white and black groups, which further muddies the discussion of ethnicity and crime. Also, arrests are not the same as criminal acts themselves. Setting homicide aside, many violent crimes go unreported and many offenders are never caught. Also, a single criminal could be counted several times if he is arrested for different offenses. To further complicate the picture, police departments patrol certain neighborhoods more than others, which makes arrests in those places more likely. When we contacted Kohn, she agreed that her number was off. The percentage she used included both white men and women, and applied to all sorts of crimes, from loitering to murder. Kohn corrected that error in her opinion piece. Accounting for population size Setting aside using the wrong number, the larger problem with Kohn’s claim is that her data point tells only half the story. There are two ways to talk about threats. Kohn chose one -- looking at what fraction of arrests for violent crimes are by a certain type of person, in this case, white men. The other way is to assess the likelihood that a certain type of person will be arrested for a violent crime. This second approach typically comes down to stating the number of crimes for every 100,000 people who are white, black, etc. Kohn used this method herself when she talked about incarceration rates for blacks compared to whites. It is true that blacks are imprisoned at about six times the rate as whites, but the source she used compared the incarceration rates for every 100,000 blacks and whites. When Kohn said that 69 percent of arrests for violent crimes were white males, she left out the population factor. ""You can't talk about risk without talking about population size,"" Fox told PunditFact. ""There are many more whites than blacks so it makes sense that the number of crimes will be high."" Using the homicide count (again, the only crime where we can separate on both race and gender) whites and blacks were arrested in about equal numbers. But cast as a rate, the results shift. For 2013, Fox calculated that black men were about seven times more likely than white men to be arrested for murder. That would be a rate of 33 murders for every 100,000 black men, compared to 4.7 for every 100,000 whites. Drawing on the 2012 figures, whites were arrested for over 275,000 violent crimes. For blacks, the number is about 170,000. So while whites were arrested more, the arrest rate for blacks is nearly four times that for whites. Does that mean that from the point of view of the average citizen that blacks pose a greater threat? Not necessarily. ""If one considers the absolute number of offenders and it turns out there are a larger number of offenders from Group A than Group B, then it stands to reason that Group A is the greater threat in terms of likelihood of criminal acts,"" said Lorie Fridell, a criminologist at the University of South Florida. Robert Brame, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, echoed Fridell’s assessment. ""The statistical fact is that you’re more likely to be a victim of a white perpetrator than a black one just because there are so many more whites in the population,"" Brame said. But, Brame, continued, it is not enough to speak of either the total number or the population-based rate. ""My preference would be for both statistics to be provided to give the full context,"" Brame said. ""Neither statistic is complete without the other."" Our ruling Kohn said that white men are at least as dangerous as black men and cited as proof that white men represent 69 percent of people arrested for violent crimes. When presented with the inaccuracies in using that specific figure by PunditFact, Kohn corrected herself. Criminologists we contacted also told us that those absolute figures -- when used correctly --  tell only half the story. When talking about risks to society, it is equally important to provide the population-based rate. When we do that, the threat of violent crimes posed by blacks looks larger than that of whites. For these two reasons, Kohn’s claim that ""white men account for 69 percent of those arrested for violent crimes"" is inaccurate. We rate it False.","[(""CNN, The danger society doesn't talk about, March 19, 2015"", 'https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/19/opinions/kohn-young-white-men/index.html'), (""CNN, Revised: The danger society doesn't talk about, March 27, 2015"", 'No link'), ('Political Research Associates, A closer look at white male privilege, June 19, 2014', 'https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/19/opinions/kohn-young-white-men/'), ('Federal Bureau of Investigation, Crime in the United States, 2011', 'No link'), ('Bureau of Justice Statistics, Arrest Data Analysis Tool', 'http://www.politicalresearch.org/2014/06/19/mass-shooters-have-a-gender-and-a-race/#'), ('Bureau of Justice Statistics, Corrections Statistical Analysis Tool (CSAT) - Prisoners', 'No link'), ('Bureau of Justice Statistics, Homicide trends in the United States 1976-2005', 'https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/table-43'), ('Email interview, Sally Kohn, columnist, March 27, 2015', 'No link'), ('Interview, Robert Brame, criminologist, University of South Carolina, March 27, 2015', 'https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=datool&surl=/arrests/index.cfm#'), ('Email interview, Lorie Fridell, criminologist, University of South Florida, March 27, 2015', 'No link'), ('Interview, James Alan Fox, criminologist, Northeastern University, March 27, 2015', 'https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=nps')]",/factchecks/2015/apr/02/sally-kohn/sally-kohn-white-men-69-percent-arrested-violent/

Fact-checkers find beer will not transform Georgia into Mexico
","Georgia craft beer brewers and brew pub owners are waging a down-to-the-wire fight to change state law so they can sell directly to consumers. They’re hoping that today, during the harried 40th and final legislative day, state lawmakers will pass a bill allowing breweries and brew pubs to send beer home with patrons. For nearly a decade, Georgia beer brewers have been lobbying lawmakers to change state law so they can sell their product directly to consumers, something the state’s beer wholesalers and retailers oppose and laws dating to the end of Prohibition ban. At least 45 states already allow such sales, mostly in response to the growing popularity of breweries and brew pubs. Versions of the beer bill (Senate Bill 63) have cleared the Senate and House. But the much-talked-about bill won’t make it to the desk of the governor this year unless the Senate signs off today on House changes — including a March 23 subcommittee move that killed efforts to allow to-go sales at brew pubs. That followed testimony from Martin Smith, a lobbyist for the Georgia Beer Wholesalers, that opening the door to such sales could result in giant conglomerates dominating the market. ""When you allow producers to have access and allow retail, you allow that slide into what happens in the rest of the world where large producers own everything,"" Smith testified. ""In Mexico, 90 percent of the market is controlled by one entity. It allows the manufacturer to own the retail."" PolitiFact Georgia wondered, was Smith right to suggest that allowing brew pubs to sell beer for off-site consumption would set the stage for a tightly controlled beer market on par with Mexico’s? We decided to take a deeper look. First, a little background about this country's craft brewing as well as the Mexico beer market. Small and independent craft brewers in the United States reported producing 22.2 million barrels of beer in 2014, worth about $19.6 billion, or about 19 percent of an otherwise flat national beer sales network. The criticism of the Mexican beer market for years was that it effectively had largely two players and a duopoly, Modelo (owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev) and FEMSA (owned by Heineken). Smith told PolitiFact that his comments about the Mexican beer market came in response to a lawmaker’s question. (He also clarified that he wrongly told the committee there was one major producer in Mexico, rather than two.) Smith said he was describing the advantages of America’s three-tier system of beer industry brewers, distributors and retailers, which some consider the most powerful antitrust measure ever established. ""It provides equal market access for all brewers as the system restricts producers from controlling shelves or taps at retail, thus preventing market domination by a few producers,"" Smith said in an email. ""I referenced Mexico as an example of a country where producers are allowed to directly control the retail market, and thus two producers control 90 percent of the beer market, which essentially blocks out all new, small, ‘craft’ producers."" Last month, Craig Purser, president of the National Beer Wholesalers Association. said policymakers  ""need only look to America’s neighbor to the south, Mexico, to see what can happen without a three-tier system. "" As Joni Mitchell sang, ""You don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone,"" Purser wrote in a column. Bart Watson, the chief economist for the Colorado-based Brewers Association, the craft brewers trade association, called the Mexico argument ""a red herring."" This ""slippery slope"" argument is one the National Beer Wholesalers Association constantly uses to try to forestall even minor changes to the three-tier system, Watson said. But Georgia’s proposed changes ""are small, reasonable and would likely be beneficial for the state and consumers,"" he said. Watson said there’s no evidence that any state — including Georgia — has or would develop into a Mexico with only a couple of producers dominating the market. All states that allow brew pub to-go sales have limits on production, sales or most often both, Watson said. At least 42 states allow ""to-go"" brew pub sales, said Nancy Palmer, the executive director of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild. Four — Georgia, Alabama, Florida and New Mexico — don’t allow customers to leave with beer in a resealable container, Watson said. Even in the states with what are considered the laxest laws, the result has been more, not less, consumer choice, he said. ""The NBWA’s opposition to these laws by comparing them to what has happened in Mexico is nonsensical,"" Watson said. Palmer, from the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild, said the Mexico argument ""is just one in a series of straw-man arguments that the wholesalers and their crew of lobbyists use to confuse, obfuscate and distract from the actual issues at hand."" Georgia’s proposed law has strict sales limits. As introduced, it would allow breweries to sell up to 72 ounces per person per day on-site and up to a 12-pack to go. It would lift a prohibition on bottling by brew pubs, which are now restricted to making draft beer only, and allow them to have to-go sales of up to 144 ounces of beer per day per person. The Senate version bars brewery sales but would allow them to sell tours and give away ""free tastings"" of up to 36 ounces per person per day, plus a ""free souvenir"" of 64 ounces in a to-go container. Our ruling A vast majority of states have allowed breweries and brew pubs to sell directly to their consumers in a segment of the beer market that is flourishing. There’s no evidence that they could become consumer-unfriendly market-rulers under existing state laws or Georgia's proposed law. To say otherwise is beyond a stretch. We rate the statement False.","[('\'\'Beer jobs\' bill advances with distilleries, but minus beer pubs,"" by Aaaron Gould Sheinin, The Atlanta JournalConstitution, March 23, 2015', 'https://www.ajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/beer-jobs-bill-advances-with-distilleries-but-minu/nkc5R/'), ('21st Amendment Blog: Sabmiller believes Mexico’s beer duopoly – Modelo and FEMSA – is unfairly restricting entry of Miller products into Mexican markets', 'No link'), ('Phone interview and emails with Bart Watson, PhD, chief economist, Brewers Associatio', 'https://21stamendmentlawblog.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/sabmiller-believes-mexicos-beer-duopoly-modelo-and-femsa-is-unfairly-restricting-entry-of-miller-products-into-mexican-markets'), ('""Why Corona Is Big in the U.S., And Miller Is Scarce in Mexico,"" by David Luhnow , Wall Street Journal, January 17, 2003 ', 'No link'), ('""Global Beer: The Road to Monopoly,"" by Bernard Ascher, The American Antitrust Institute, at 19-20, November 14, 2012', 'https://online.wsj.com/article/SB1042757831758048544.html'), ('Phone interview and email with Nancy Palmer, executive director of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/apr/02/martin-smith/fact-checkers-find-beer-will-not-transform-georgia/

Meme touts Mark Dayton's economic successes as governor of Minnesota; is it accurate?
","Recent electoral trends have not been kind to Democratic governors. When Barack Obama was elected president, 28 of the nation’s 50 governors were Democratic. Now, just 18 governors are Democrats, even as lots of current and former Republican governors are considered presidential prospects. But there’s one Democratic governor who’s been getting attention recently, at least in certain social media circles: Mark Dayton of Minnesota. To some Democrats, Dayton is a governor to be emulated -- one who pursued a no-holds-barred progressive course and succeeded in improving the state’s economy. Here’s a recent meme sent to PolitiFact by a reader. It was created by Occupy Democrats, a progressive group with a significant presence on social media. ""Hello America. I am Minnesota's Democratic Governor Mark Dayton. Although Republicans nearly lost their minds and predicted an economic disaster, I raised taxes on the wealthy and raised my state's minimum wage a few years ago. Today, my state's economy is creating jobs at a record pace, unemployment is at a historic low, median income is skyrocketing, and my state has a billion dollar surplus -- which I'm going to invest in education."" It’s tricky to assign credit for economic accomplishments to particular policies, but in this case, we found problems with most of the meme’s statistical claims. We’ll go through where the meme exaggerates the facts. (Occupy Democrats did not respond to email inquiries.) Here’s a look at the claims, one by one. • ""Creating jobs at a record pace."" We looked at state-level data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that the number of employed Minnesota residents rose by 31,300 over the course of 2014 and by 35,600 over the course of 2013. That’s a pretty good clip, but it’s still a only middling amount when compared to how Minnesota has done historically. In roughly a half-dozen years since 1990, Minnesota has seen its job gains top 60,000 or even 70,000 a year. So the current pace is hardly a ""record."" • ""Unemployment is at a historic low."" As we noted, unemployment in Minnesota today is an impressive 3.7 percent. But that isn’t a ""historic low."" In fact, it was lower for almost four and a half consecutive years, from January 1997 until May 2001. During that stretch, the unemployment rate went as low as 2.5 percent. • ""Median income is skyrocketing."" Median household incomes have been increasing in Minnesota faster than the United States as a whole. Over the past three years, inflation-adjusted, median household incomes have increased more than twice as fast in Minnesota as in the U.S. -- up by 9.5 percent in Minnesota between 2010 to 2013, as opposed to 4.4 percent nationally. Still, to put this in context, that means the median Minnesota household has seen its real incomes rise by 1.7 percentage points per year faster than the country as a whole. That’s certainly progress, but we don’t think most people would consider that rate of increase ""skyrocketing."" • ""A billion dollar surplus."" This is the one point on which the meme appears to be accurate (and, in fact, underplays the number). The state is looking at a projected surplus of nearly $1.9 billion. We should reiterate that, by national standards, Minnesota is indeed doing well. The state has a 3.7 percent unemployment rate -- the fifth best of any state and significantly lower than the national rate of 5.5 percent. And Minnesota ranks seventh-highest among the 50 states in median household income. But this meme doesn’t just say that Minnesota has better-than-average metrics for employment and income -- it uses some very specific superlatives that aren’t in tune with the data. Our ruling Occupy Democrats said that Minnesota ""is creating jobs at a record pace, unemployment is at a historic low, median income is skyrocketing, and (the) state has a billion-dollar surplus."" While Minnesota is doing well on several key economic measurements, its achievements do not qualify as a ""record,"" ""historic"" or ""skyrocketing."" Only the meme’s budget surplus claim is correct. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.","[('Occupy Democrats, social media meme, received by PolitiFact March 30, 2015', 'http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?la'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, Local Area Unemployment Statistics (main index page), accessed March 30, 2015', 'No link'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, Minnesota and U.S. median householf Income in the past 12 months in 2013 inflation-adjusted dollars from the 2013 American Community Survey, one-year estimates, accessed April 1, 2015', 'http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk'), ('Minnesota Management and Budget, Budget and Economic Forecast, February 2015', 'No link'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, Unemployment Rates for States, accessed March 30, 2015', 'http://www.mn.gov/mmb/images/Budget%2526Economic_Forecast_Feb2015.pdf'), ('Minnesota Public Radio, ""Senate DFL wants surplus used for schools, reserves,"" March 27, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Matt Swenson, press secretary and senior communications advisor for Mark Dayton, March 30, 2015', 'http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm'), ('Email interview with John Pollard, legislative and communications director for Minnesota Management and Budget, March 30, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Madeline Koch, director of communications for the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, March 30, 2015', 'http://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/03/senate-dfl-wants-surplus-used-for-schools-reserves/')]",/factchecks/2015/apr/01/occupy-democrats/meme-touts-mark-daytons-economic-successes-minneso/

Fran Lebowitz claims NYPD hasn't shot an unarmed white person in about 45 years
","Don’t get sardonic New York City writer Fran Lebowitz started on Rudy Giuliani. She is no fan of the former New York mayor and conservative pundit, especially after he loudly questioned President Barack Obama’s love for the United States. HBO host Bill Maher got an earful on the subject when he invited Lebowitz to appear in a panel about Giuliani’s rhetoric. Lebowitz said the explanation for Giuliani’s remarks is simple: His policies have been racist since his first election when he campaigned on a nostalgic 1950s-era platform, and this racism extended to longstanding disparate treatment of blacks and whites by the New York Police Department. ""When Giuliani was the mayor, every five minutes an unarmed black guy was shot in the back. Constantly, you know, and it was always a different excuse from the cops,"" she said. "" ‘He had something in his hand, I thought it was a gun.’ It was a candy bar. ‘He had something in his hand, I thought it was a gun.’ It was a keychain."" Maher said, ""Well, that hasn't changed, and that's not just New York."" ""In the entire time I've lived in New York, which has been many decades, not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police,"" Lebowitz said. ""Not one. Not one. You think the odds would be? Not one. So that is the reason they're shot, period."" Lebowitz made two claims — that ""every five minutes an unarmed black guy was shot in the back,"" and ""not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police"" in the entire time Lebowitz has lived in New York. A reader asked us to hone in on the second claim, brushing off the first as hyperbole. Contacting Lebowitz Lebowitz moved to New York City from New Jersey sometime in the late 1960s. Our rough math: She was born in 1950, and this New York Times profile says she moved there after high school. So, to Lebowitz, an unarmed white person has not been shot by New York police in at least about 45 years. We reached her through representatives at the Steven Barclay Agency. Sara Bixler told PunditFact, ""Fran Lebowitz tells me that to her knowledge, this is true — she meant it non-hyperbolically. She said that if she is wrong, she would like to know, of course."" No simple data The difficulty in judging Lebowitz's statement is that there is no comprehensive database that details police shootings across the country, much less New York City. That means there is no go-to source that shows shootings by race and whether those shot were unarmed or armed. Reporting to the FBI is optional, and most of the country’s 18,000 law enforcement agencies choose not to report. The gap in data gained prominence after last fall’s shooting of Michael Brown by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Mo. The New York Police Department likely can prove Lebowitz right or wrong. But the agency ignored our calls and emails spread out over more than five weeks. Our request was ""under consideration"" six days after the first email we sent Feb. 25. NYPD did not respond to our March 26 query for information. An early 1970s study So what information is available? We located a study of NYPD officer shootings from 1971 to 1975 by James J. Fyfe. His study, ""Shots Fired,"" spans 700 pages and relies on access to detailed NYPD shooting incident records. Fyfe broke down the shootings by race and by weapon. More than half of the black residents who were shot by police were carrying a handgun, compared to 48 percent of Hispanics and 32 percent of whites. The white ""opponents,"" as Fyfe calls them, were more likely to be shot while not carrying a weapon or while using physical force. Crucially for this fact-check, Fyfe's data show 56 whites were unarmed when police shot at them during those years (1971-75), and another 34 whites were shot when using physical force. Of the more than 1,800 primary opponents of police shootings during those years, 19 percent were white, 58 percent were black, and 23 percent were Hispanic. ""She is simply wrong about unarmed whites ‘never’ being shot,"" said David Klinger, a University of Missouri St. Louis criminology professor who tracks police use of deadly force around the country. However, Fyfe’s report does include holes pivotal to our specific question. We can’t drill down on the circumstances in which the white residents ended up getting shot at by police. Racial categories are also very difficult to assess sometimes. And we can't ask Fyfe, who died in 2006. ""Is a Spanish-speaking white person ‘Hispanic’ and thus non-white? Are English-speaking biracial people from immigrant backgrounds non-white?"" said Candace McCoy, City University of New York criminology professor (McCoy and Fyfe were married). ""New York is so incredibly diverse. It's hard to find people who are unequivocally what we consider as ‘white’ sometimes."" What NYPD data says and doesn’t say NYPD has released an annual report outlining officers’ firearm discharges since 1971. That was a particularly brutal year for both shootings of cops (47 injured, 12 killed) as well as the number of people shot and killed by police (221 injured, 93 people killed). Those numbers have fallen substantially since the 1970s. In 2013, the latest year for which data is available, three officers were shot and none was killed, and officers shot 17 people and killed eight. We found several, but not all, reports online. And of the ones we found, many did not include critical racial data. The last chart in the appendix of recent reports outlines ""intentional discharges"" of firearms during adversarial conflicts, as well as the race and age of the person involved. Most often, this is when an officer shoots at a person armed with a gun in self-defense, though there are also categories for shootings of subjects with imitation firearms, threat or use of knives and other cutting objects, blunt instruments, or a final category called ""use/threaten the use of overwhelming physical force."" ""Overwhelming physical force"" covers times when an unarmed person physically attacks or threatens to attack an officer, such as gang assaults, pushing an officer from a roof or subway train platform, or trying to take the officer’s firearm. We compiled the following chart, filling in blanks for the number of whites shot each year and how many were unarmed if reports were available online. We could only go back to 1995. As you can see, many did not have the information we need. Year Number of whites shot Number whites unarmed 2013 2 0 2012 3 0 2011 7 0 2010 5 0 2009 0 0 2008 2 0 2007 2 unknown 2006 no race data kept 2005 no race data kept 2004 no race data kept 2003 no race data kept 2002 no race data kept 2001 no race data kept 2000 no race data kept 1999 no race data kept 1998 no race data kept 1997 26 unknown 1996 32 unknown   Some observations after scouring the NYPD reports: • Whites are shot at less frequently than blacks and Hispanics. • The whites who were shot at by police were allegedly carrying a firearm, a blunt weapon, imitation gun, threatening others with weapons, or using their vehicles as weapons. • And most importantly in this quest, several years’ reports did not include information on the race of the victim. The last point was a bone of contention with the New York Civil Liberties Union, which in 2008 complained before the city council about the police not reporting the race of victims since 1998. The department was, however, reporting on the breed of dogs its officers shot. ""That the department is providing more information about the dogs it is shooting at than people who are its intended targets is deeply disturbing and must be connected,"" the NYCLU said. We will note that these years cover some of Giuliani’s mayoral tenure from 1994 to 2001. The department has offered more descriptive accounting of officer-involved shootings in recent years after pressure from the NYCLU and media coverage. Other ideas We searched news articles from New York and found no case that explicity fits Lebowitz's criteria. We also consulted several experts on criminology and police shooting statistics looking for additional information.  James Acker, a University of Albany-SUNY College of Criminal Justice professor, pointed us to a New York Daily News investigation that found in 179 officer-involved shootings, 86 percent of victims when race was known were either black or Hispanic. But we still do not know what percentage were white with certainty and whether they were armed. Fewer than one-third of the people who died were unarmed, as examined by the Daily News. Acker also suggested New York's vital statistics reports for deaths caused by legal interventions and then sorting by race/ethnicity. Using that tool, we know 15 whites were shot by police in the city from 2000 (the earliest starting point for the database) to 2012. That’s an undercount from the chart above. But we do not know whether they were armed. Contrary to Lebowitz’s broader point, Klinger notes, police violence actually fell under Giuliani. Victims in police shootings by NYPD cops fell from 90 people (29 fatals) in 1994 to 30 people in 2001 (11 fatal), Klinger said, citing his own records. D. Brian Burghart, editor and publisher of the Reno News & Review, created his own website, Fatal Encounters, to document fatal police shooting. Using his database, we found about a dozen examples of former, off-duty and current New York City police officers fatally shooting white people or killing them with their cars in accidents from pursuits or driving while intoxicated and off-duty. But most were armed with knives, guns or other weapons, or were killed during vehicle pursuits. Many showed signs of mental illness. There were no examples of an unarmed person being shot by a cop. Our ruling Lebowitz said, ""Not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police"" since she has lived in New York. This was a bear of fact-check to wrestle to the ground, in part because of the lack of cooperation from the New York Police Department, in part because we were looking at a time period that spanned about 45 years, and in part because it is clear that African-Americans and Hispanics were clearly shot at by New York police much more than whites. All that said, an analysis of police data show police shot dozens of unarmed white people during the early 1970s, the early side of Lebowitz’s life in New York City. While we wish we had complete data on police shootings by each victim’s race and armed status for the 1980s on, we don’t necessarily need it to judge Lebowitz’s particular statement. It is very accurate to say blacks are shot at more often by police than whites. But that is not what Lebowitz said. She said ""not a single unarmed white person has been shot,"" and that is not true. We rate her claim False. Note: This claim was fact-checked as part of a reward to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union.
