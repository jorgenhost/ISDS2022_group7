Dem operative Woodhouse says NYT retracted charges of illegality in Clinton email story
","Questions about Hillary Clinton’s handling of her email records during her time as secretary of state are likely to dog her throughout her presidential campaign. But the candidate will have many defenders, including Correct the Record, a super PAC created to support Clinton. Correct the Record president Brad Woodhouse, a long-time Democratic operative, dismissed the entire email matter during an interview recently on CNN. ""Every federal employer has to consider what they archive as work-related and what they consider personal, and she did what every other federal official did, what every other previous secretaries of state did,"" Woodhouse told New Day co-hosts Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota on June 5, 2015. ""Look, nobody has found -- you know, the New York Times  wrote a story that some type of laws had been broken. Turns out they had to retract that. People had to back off that, and it's totally not true."" In the news business, retractions don’t come lightly and we wondered if in fact, the newspaper of record had taken back part of what it reported on Clinton. In reality, the New York Times hasn’t retracted a word. The closest it came was in a column from public editor Margaret Sullivan, who wrote that the article that broke the story ""was not without fault."" But the lapse, Sullivan continued, was a failure to list exactly which regulations Clinton might have ignored. That lack of specificity, Sullivan wrote, allowed Clinton supporters to score political points. ""Not because it highlighted a factual error — the story was accurate — but because it kicked up enough dust to obscure the facts."" Sullivan, we should note, doesn’t speak for the newspaper. Her job is to serve as an internal but independent critic of the paper’s work, something akin to an inspector general in government. Formal retractions or corrections come from the editors themselves, and as we noted, that has not happened. Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for Correct the Record, said Woodhouse was not using the word retraction in an official sense. Rather, he was speaking of the gradual fade in New York Times coverage that insinuated that Clinton had broken some law. ""Ultimately the charge was retracted, even if the New York Times never issued a correction,"" Watson said. ""Their own experts changed their minds."" Let’s unpack that. What the ‘New York Times’ said The newspaper broke the story under the headline ""Hillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Dept., Possibly Breaking Rules."" It’s opening lines were ""Hillary Rodham Clinton exclusively used a personal email account to conduct government business as secretary of state, State Department officials said, and may have violated federal requirements that officials’ correspondence be retained as part of the agency’s record."" So the top of the story suggested a possible violation, which falls short of charging outright that she broke a law, as Woodhouse said. But the article does lay the groundwork to add weight to the idea of a potential violation. ""Under federal law, however, letters and emails written and received by federal officials, such as the secretary of state, are considered government records and are supposed to be retained so that congressional committees, historians and members of the news media can find them."" And: ""Regulations from the National Archives and Records Administration at the time required that any emails sent or received from personal accounts be preserved as part of the agency’s records. But Mrs. Clinton and her aides failed to do so."" About week and half after the initial story, the New York Times wrote that the regulations on preserving emails were vague. ""Although the White House has strict requirements dating back two decades that every email must be saved, there is no such requirement for federal agencies. Instead they are in charge of setting their own policies for determining which emails constitute government records worthy of preservation and which ones may be discarded."" While, as the story noted, President Barack Obama signed a 2014 bill that required government officials who use personal email accounts to hand over those records in 20 days, that law took effect after Clinton left the State Department. According to Thomas Blanton, a government disclosure expert cited in the story, this gave Clinton ""wiggle room."" Blanton was also cited in the original article. However, it is not accurate to say he changed his mind from one week to the next. In the first New York Times story, Blanton said ""it was a shame"" that the emails from Clinton’s personal account had not been turned over automatically. The New York Times also cited in its first story Jason Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle and Reath, who is a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration. At the time, Baron said he could not think of another instance when a high-ranking official used a private email account for all government business. Baron described Clinton’s email scenario as a serious breach. However, Baron did not say the practice was illegal. In the weeks that followed, he consistently said it was a bad practice. Our ruling Woodhouse said that the New York Times retracted the charge that Clinton’s handling of her email broke a law. That's wrong on two points. The newspaper never accused Clinton of breaking a law. Also, while the newspaper’s public editor said the original story should have included more details, the paper never issued a retraction or a correction. A spokeswoman for Woodhouse’s organization agreed with that point. The claim is not accurate, and we rate it False.",/factchecks/2015/jun/11/brad-woodhouse/dem-operative-woodhouse-says-nyt-retracted-charges/

Social media posts say U.S. Embassy moved July 4 celebration to June 4 to 'accommodate' Ramadan
","There’s a new outrage at the Obama administration in the social media universe, this time for actions that seem to place Muslim sensibilities above good old-fashioned American patriotism. ""U.S. Embassy Celebrates America’s Independence on June 4th in Order to Accommodate Muslims,"" reads one typical headline on the website Young Conservatives. Other conservative sites published similar posts, including the Federalist Papers Project (which blamed a ""misplaced sense of political correctness""), Gateway Pundit (which griped, ""It’s an Obama world"") and the American Thinker (which called the decision ""mind-boggling""). Several readers spotted such claims in their social media feeds and asked us to check them out. The urban-legends site Snopes.com also checked into the claim. Most of the social media posts cite a news story published on June 5, 2015, in the Jakarta Post, an English-language newspaper in Indonesia’s capital city. ""The United States Embassy enjoyed its annual 4th of July celebration on Thursday, June 4, one month early, in order to respect the upcoming Ramadhan month, which will begin on June 17 and last for one month,"" the story said. ""U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia Robert O. Blake and U.S. Ambassador to (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Nina Hachigian presided over the festivities, which involved brass band renditions of the Star-Spangled Banner and the Indonesian national anthem, Indonesia Raya."" The same day, the embassy put out a prepared text of the ambassador’s remarks from the event. ""Friends, my fellow Americans, welcome to America's Independence Day celebration!"" he said. ""We are celebrating a month early to respect the holy month of Ramadan, but today we remember the revolutionary Congress meeting on July 4, 1776, in Philadelphia that issued America’s ‘Declaration of Independence’ that changed the course of modern history."" So, there’s a solid basis for the social-media claims that (1) the embassy moved the date of its celebration of July 4, and (2) that it did it in order to accommodate Ramadan. Still, it’s worth noting some additional context that overheated social media posts overlooked or ignored. Indonesia has more Muslim residents than any other country in the world -- an estimated 204 million in 2010, or 88 percent of the country’s total population. So the marking of Ramadan -- the month-long period of daylight fasting and self-reflection -- has a significant impact on daily life in Indonesia. Because Ramadan is tied to the lunar calendar, it cycles around the calendar through all the seasons. This year, it happened to overlap with July 4, but in another year, it could overlap with Christmas or Thanksgiving. Diplomatic experts told PolitiFact that the key reason such parties are held in the first place is not for the benefit of embassy staff or Americans, but rather to share America’s values with opinion leaders in the host country. ""An embassy’s Fourth of July celebration is an occasion to play host to a wide range of important figures in the local society, to cultivate their friendship and understanding, and to show off some of the attractive features of American culture -- openness, hospitality, generosity, and the enjoyment of simple pleasures,"" said Harry W. Kopp, a former foreign service officer who co-authored the book Career Diplomacy. If people in Jakarta are preoccupied with a holy month -- and one where they cannot eat during daylight hours -- then it doesn’t make sense to schedule an outreach event for that period, he said. During the daily State Department briefing on June 9, department spokesman Jeff Rathke confirmed that was the thinking. The purpose of the event ""is to represent the United States to the host nation and to the host government,"" Rathke said. ""So of course, to do that most effectively, we want to hold these events when the guests are best able to attend and when we can most effectively achieve the purpose of the event. Such reschedulings are ""not unusual"" and are done ""for various reasons,"" said Nicholas Kralev, a former diplomatic correspondent and author. These include reschedulings for reasons having nothing to do with Ramadan. ""In 2012, the U.S. Embassy in Oman celebrated our 236th year of independence in February that year,"" according to the diplomatic blog Diplopundit. ""We were once told that heat is the reason for these early 4th of July celebrations at various overseas posts. At one (European) post, we heard that it was the heat and the fact that most government officials leave the capital city in July. In 2013 and again in 2014, the US Embassy in Nepal celebrated July 4th three months earlier, in March ‘in the hopes of escaping monsoon weather.’ "" Our ruling Various social media posts recently offered headlines like this one: ""U.S. Embassy Celebrates America’s Independence on June 4th in Order to Accommodate Muslims"" The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta did reschedule its July 4 celebration for June 4, and it explained the move as a way ""to respect"" the holy month of Ramadan. The switch had to do with increasing the odds of a successful event by scheduling it when local people would not be distracted by a religious observance that requires daytime fasting. Also, it’s not unprecedented for embassies to re-schedule July 4th celebrations for a variety of reasons, including the weather. The blog posts are accurate but require additional information, so we rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jun/10/blog-posting/social-media-posts-say-us-embassy-moved-july-4-cel/

Dale Kooyenga says graduation rates have risen since Republicans took over in Wisconsin
","Ever since Act 10 passed in 2011, Democrats have argued Republican policies ""gutted"" public education in Wisconsin. After all, the measure included a cut of $792 million in state aid for schools. Now, state Rep. Dale Kooyenga (R-Brookfield) says the party’s actions have improved educational outcomes in the state. Kooyenga went on conservative radio host Vicki McKenna’s Madison show on May 22, 2015, broadcast on WIBA. He had this to say about education and the debate over the 2015-’17 budget. ""If you look at what we've done -- Republicans in Wisconsin -- you know this whole education debate over the last four months, five months. It's all been about inputs, inputs, inputs. Money, money, money, money, money,"" Kooyenga said. ""We should focus on outputs. And here's where we're at in education in Wisconsin. ""Five years ago, when Republicans had taken over, the graduation rate in Wisconsin has gone from 86 percent to 88 percent. The black graduation rate has gone from 60 percent to 65 percent. The Latino graduation rate has gone from 65 percent to 71 percent."" Gov. Scott Walker made a similar claim in 2014 when he said: ""graduation and third-grade reading scores are up in the state since I took office."" When we checked that claim in April 2014, we rated it Mostly True. Both numbers had gone up some, though the trend pre-dated Walker. What’s more, the claim was pretty much a numbers one -- there was no direct claim by Walker that his policies made the difference. That’s where Kooyenga’s claim differs. Did the numbers Kooyenga cited all rise? And are GOP policies responsible? The numbers   According to reports by the state Department of Public Instruction, graduation rates have continued to increase.  Here is a look at what the numbers show: 
  2009-’10 2010-’11 2011-’12 2012-’13 Statewide 85.7% 87% 87.5% 88% Black 60.5% 63.8% 62.7% 64.8% Latino 69% 72% 74.3% 74.3% Kooyenga hit the mark on the statewide numbers and the number for black students, but was a little low on the increase for Latino students. He had noted a slightly lower increase in the graduation rate, from 65 percent to 71 percent. ""The main premise remains the same,"" said Rachel Geary, a legislative assistant for Kooyenga. ""The grad rate significantly increased closing the gap between minorities and the rest of the state.""   But what about the assertion that Republican policies are to thank?   GOP credit A look at longer-term graduation trends -- and whether the rise predates the arrival of Republican control in Madison in 2011 -- is tricky. Just as Republicans took over, state officials switched the way graduation rates are measured from an old methodology that compared how many students graduated from a freshman class. Individual students, who may transfer in and out of a school, are not tracked, which can muddy the numbers. The new methodology uses a more accurate model that tracks individual students. The calculation was standardized across the country starting in the 2009-’10 school year, so new numbers cannot be directly compared to ones from the earlier system. When we looked back at the trend in graduation rates, the data showed the statewide graduation rate in Wisconsin has been on the rise -- about half a percentage point each year.   When we asked Kooyenga for evidence of Republican's influence upon the rise in graduation rates, he acknowledged ""many factors, including dozens outside of public policy, have an impact on these metrics."" Experts say factors that influence how kids do in school include socioeconomic status, school type and location, and parental involvement. ""However, Act 10 was the most significant change to education policy in this state and noticeable improvement in outcomes has been evident every year since enactment,"" Kooyenga said. ""Superintendents have told us that Act 10 has freed up time and resources negotiating contracts, and instead allowed them to innovate and redeploy assets to better achieve their educational objectives."" Act 10 reformed collective bargaining and lessened the power of unions for public employees. The bill also included a massive cut to state aid to schools. We rated a claim that the $792 million decrease in funding was the largest in state history True in February 2012. Walker and the GOP argue that districts have used the tools from Act 10 to offset the cuts, like eliminating or altering post-retirement benefits. The controversial budget bill went into effect in 2011, and it's tough to say when the effects of the bills really reached schools. When the bill passed, about two-thirds of schools had already negotiated teaching contracts for the upcoming year. Others have since taken advantage of the flexibility allowed by the law. What if you used 2012-’13 as a better baseline for a post-Act 10 comparison? Was there a significant difference in graduation rates?   Not really.   Between the 2011-’12 and 2012-’13 school years, statewide graduation rates went up half a percentage point. The percentage of black students who graduated went up by two percentage points. And the Latino rate went unchanged. The last cohort we have data for graduated at the end of the 2012-’13 school year.   Likewise, there was a small increase between those years, following the trend.   Our rating Kooyenga said graduation rates in the state increased thanks to actions by Republicans, including the passage of Act 10.   The numbers did rise, but the trend existed before the GOP took over. What’s more, experts say many other factors are at work and the passage of Act 10 wasn’t followed by significant changes. We rate his claim Half True.  ",/factchecks/2015/jun/10/dale-kooyenga/dale-kooyenga-says-graduation-rates-have-risen-rep/

Georgia leads nation in lightning claims
","Florida leads the nation in deaths from lightning strikes. But State Farm, one of the nation’s major insurers, says it is Georgia residents who file the most claims for lightning strikes in the country, WSB-TV reported Friday, June 5. PolitiFact Georgia was intrigued and decided to dig a little deeper.   We began by contacting Justin Tomczak, a State Farm spokesman.   He sent us data showing Georgia was No. 1 in 2014 for lightning-related claims both in number (3,709) and total dollar value ($16.3 million). Texas was second, Alabama at third, Louisiana at fourth and Illinois at fifth.     STATE  Reported Count   Paid Indemnity                                                                                                                                                                 Georgia         3,709    $16,301,952 Texas        2,201 $14,160,258 Alabama   1,902        $10,930,264 Louisiana       1,707 $10,930,264 Illinois   1,669 $8,030,507 .   ""This is the third year in a row that Georgia has been ranked No. 1,"" Tomczak said.   Most of the lightning claims were surge- or power-related, the spokesman said.   Damages generally resulted from power surges in electrical wiring, TV cable or phone lines in homes or businesses, he said.   As to why Georgia has the most claims, Tomczak said, ""there is no simple answer. However, many of the lightning claims are concentrated in the Southeastern United States, and Georgia has one of the highest populations in this area.""   John Jensenius, lightning safety specialist with the National Weather Service, said the population density in metro Atlanta may be a factor in Georgia’s high claim rate.   The denser the population the more likely lightning will strike a house, Jensenius said.   The Insurance Information Institute, in conjunction with State Farm, compiles a list each year of the top 10 states for homeowners insurance lightning losses by number of claims.   In 2013, the institute listed Georgia as highest with 11,184 lightning-related insurance claims from homeowners. Its 2014 report is due out within days, a spokeswoman said.   (Georgia was No. 1 for 2012 with 3,844 claims totalling $21.5 million and for 2013 with 2,969 claims totalling $14.9 million, according to State Farm).   Nationwide, lightning strikes cost about $674 million in homeowners insurance losses in 2013, down 30.5 percent from 2012, according to the institute.   From 2007 to 2011, local fire departments across the country responded to an average of 22,600 fires a year that were started by lightning, according to the National Fire Protection Association.   These fires caused an average of $451 million in direct property damage and nine civilian deaths a year, an NFPA analysis shows.   Lightning deaths   Florida led the nation for lightning deaths in 2014 with six, followed by Wisconsin with three. Georgia, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado and Massachusetts each had two deaths.   Seven additional states -- California, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Texas -- reported one lightning death in the year.   The 26 lightning deaths in 2014 followed a record low of 23 set in 2013.   The National Weather Service said deaths from lightning strikes averaged 33 a year from 2004 to 2013 and, going back over the last 30 years, an average of 51 people died each year after being hit by lightning.   The significant decline in lightning deaths has been attributed to fewer farmers working in the fields, technological advances, improved safety standards and protection.   As of the June 1, 2015 there have been six lightning fatalities, two in North Carolina and one each in Iowa, Florida, New Mexico and West Virginia, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).   WSB-TV meteorologist Brian Monahan said lightning strikes occur most often in Georgia during the summer months when the high pressure area out in the Atlantic around Bermuda pumps in warm, humid air, creating those all-too-familiar afternoon and evening thunderstorms.   A secondary spike of lightning strikes also occurs in the severe weather seasons of March to early May and around October and November, when the air is still warm and humid enough to support storms, Monahan said.   Our ruling State Farm says Georgia residents file the most claims for lightning strikes in the country. There’s evidence this has been the case last year and the two previous years. We rate the statement as True.  ",/factchecks/2015/jun/10/state-farm-insurance/georgia-leads-nation-lightning-claims/

Scott Walker limited early voting, made it harder for college students to vote, Hillary Clinton says
","In pursuing a 2016 bid for the White House, Gov. Scott Walker has seized opportunities to criticize Hillary Clinton. So it was no surprise when the Democratic frontrunner included Walker in an attack she made on four of the GOP presidential contenders. On June 4, 2015, Clinton gave what the Associated Press called one of her most partisan speeches as a presidential candidate. At historically black Texas Southern University in Houston, she accused Walker, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush of trying to make it more difficult for millions of Americans to vote. Clinton started the attack in a folksy way, saying: ""Now, some of you may have heard me or my husband say one of our favorite sayings from Arkansas -- of course, I learned it from him: ‘If you find a turtle on a fence post, it did not get there on its own.’ Well, all of these problems with voting just didn’t happen by accident."" Moments later, she made the claim we want to check, saying: ""In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker cut back early voting and signed legislation that would make it harder for college students to vote."" Clinton made the claim six days after Marc Elias, the general counsel for her campaign and an election law expert, filed a federal lawsuit alleging that voter-rule changes in Wisconsin since Walker took office amount to voter suppression. As we'll see, Walker did cut back on so-called early voting for all voters, but the changes that could make it more difficult for college students would affect only some students. Early voting Walker has signed two measures that restrict early voting -- or more precisely, in-person absentee voting. That's where you cast your ballot at your local municipal clerk's office prior to Election Day. 1. In May 2011, Walker signed a law requiring a photo ID to vote (more on that below). That measure also shortened in-person absentee voting to two weeks, including one weekend. The change meant the final day for in-person absentee voting was the Friday before Election Day, which always falls on a Tuesday in Wisconsin. Previously, municipalities could offer early voting as soon as ballots were printed, usually for about 30 to 45 days including weekends, through the final day before the election. 2. In March 2014, Walker signed legislation that eliminated early voting on weekends. It's now allowed only between 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays. However, Walker used his partial veto powers to nix language that would have restricted early voting in Milwaukee and other cities to 45 hours a week. College students Two other provisions in the measures signed by Walker arguably are more likely to affect at least some college students as compared to other groups of voters. 1. The photo ID law, which applies to nearly all voters, has not been used much yet. The 2011 law was in effect for a statewide primary election in February 2012, but then was blocked as it was challenged in court. Ultimately, it was restored after the U.S. Supreme Court, in March 2015, rejected a challenge to the law. Since then, it has been used in three local special elections. The first statewide election when photo ID will be in use will be the spring primary in February 2016. The photo ID law requires residents to present a document that includes a photo in order to vote. The document could be a driver’s license, passport, state ID, or a college ID, among other things. But there was a twist when it came to college IDs. Under the law, photo IDs from accredited, Wisconsin-based colleges and universities can be used to vote, but only if they have signatures on them and expired within two years of being issued. Most IDs issued by University of Wisconsin System schools when the law was adopted didn't meet those criteria, though that is changing. As a practical matter, the vast majority of Wisconsin residents attending school in-state -- since they possess a Wisconsin drivers license or state ID -- wouldn't need a college ID in order to vote. But the voter ID law does present a new hurdle for residents of other states who attend school in Wisconsin and want to vote in Wisconsin. Since most do not have a Wisconsin drivers license, they would need to obtain a photo ID that is approved for voting. All UW System campuses but one now offer a college ID that can be used for voting, UW System spokesman Alex Hummel told us. Students need to obtain one at their campus, as the standard college ID they received when enrolling doesn’t comply with the photo ID law. UW-Stout, meanwhile, has created a new voter ID-compliant card that it is giving to new students. It plans to have all students using the new card by Oct. 1, 2015. 2. The other measure that arguably has more impact on college students requires voters to have been a resident of the voting ward for at least 28 days; previously, it was 10 days. That could affect out-of-state students in August primary elections, since some might not have been in the state 28 days before the primary. Our rating  Clinton said Walker ""cut back early voting and signed legislation that would make it harder for college students to vote."" Legislation signed by Walker reduced the number of days allowed for so-called early voting, in which voters cast absentee ballots at a municipal clerk's office before Election Day, but the blanket claim about college students overstates those changes. Some provisions could make it more difficult for certain college students to vote -- if, for example, they don't have a Wisconsin drivers license, or moved to Wisconsin less than 28 days before an election. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.

Hillary Clinton revisits Florida's 2000 and 2004 voter purge when Jeb Bush was governor
","In a speech calling for an expansion of voting rights, Hillary Clinton attacked what she described as efforts to restrict voting by Republican governors thinking of running for president, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. ""In Florida, when Jeb Bush was governor, state authorities conducted a deeply flawed purge of voters before the presidential election in 2000. Thankfully, in 2004 a plan to purge even more voters was headed off,"" she said in a speech at Texas Southern University on June 4, 2015. We decided to look back at the 2000 and 2004 voter purges in Florida to see if her description was accurate. The 2000 purge In 1997, thousands of corrupt votes were cast in a Miami mayoral election, prompting state lawmakers to approve election legislation in 1998. The bill went into effect without the signature of Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat. (A spokesman for Chiles at the time told the Miami Herald that he objected to a provision in the law related to absentee ballots.) This was the legislation that eventually led to the 2000 purge. The 1998 law provided $4 million to weed out dead people and felons from the state's voter rolls. So the Department of State hired Boca Raton-based DTS Technologies to produce a list of possible felons. (In Florida, a felon couldn’t vote unless he or she underwent a cumbersome restoration process overseen by the governor and Cabinet.) The company warned the state that their matches would produce many false positives, but state officials wanted DTS to use broad parameters, which meant more felons off the rolls. In August 1998, Secretary of State Sandra Mortham announced that about 50,000 felons and 17,000 dead people were on the voter rolls. Almost immediately, questions arose about the accuracy of the list. Twenty county election supervisors decided to ignore the state’s directive, because they found the data unreliable, including a Marion County elections supervisor who found her own name on the list. Leon County Supervisor of Elections Ion Sancho said he received a list of about 700 names before the 2000 election. ""We did a check on it and could only find 30-some felons,"" Sancho said. ""We cleared 94 percent of the list."" But not all counties did their own research on the ""deeply flawed"" list, he said. ""If you went to vote on Nov. 7, and an official said you are on the list, if you tried to argue you could be arrested, and you were told so,"" he said. Ultimately, it was Mortham’s successor, Katherine Harris, elected in 1998, who oversaw the 2000 purge along with a state elections lawyer Emmett Mitchell. (In 2003, Florida’s elected secretary of state became an appointed position.) After the election, news organizations and other groups tried to figure out how many people had been denied the right to vote. But the numbers varied widely — though the reported estimates were higher than George W. Bush’s 537-margin in the 2000 presidential election. A 2001 Palm Beach Post investigation asserted that at least 1,100 eligible voters were wrongly purged. Other reports put the figure much higher. The NAACP and American Civil Liberties Union sued the state in 2000, and the settlement required the state to run its old felon lists with new standards. At a hearing before the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in January 2001, Bush placed the blame for the state’s woes on election officials. But a divided commission concluded that many Florida leaders were responsible, including Bush, for the ""unjust removal of disproportionate numbers of African American voters."" A week later, Bush along with the Cabinet implemented the commission’s recommendation to make the clemency process easier for ex-felons seeking to restore their voting rights. Botched purge in 2004 The state compiled a new list of 47,000 potential felons before the 2004 election. But after a lawsuit forced the state to make the list publicly available in July 2004, the Miami Herald reported that more than 2,000 of those names -- many of them black Democrats -- should not have been on the list, because their rights to vote were restored through the state's clemency process. A separate issue was that Hispanics made up 0.1 percent of the list, in a state where nearly one in five residents were Hispanic. The state’s criminal database didn’t have ""Hispanic"" as a category, but voter registration rolls did have it, which created a discrepancy. Less than two weeks after the list was released, the state scrapped the entire list, saying it was flawed. Not including Hispanic felons on the list ""was an oversight and a mistake. … And we accept responsibility, and that's why we're pulling it back,"" Bush said at the time. But even before they tossed the list, state officials knew it was flawed. A May 2 internal memo detailed a half dozen missed deadlines, failed software programs, repeated miscues and personnel problems. Our ruling Clinton said, ""In Florida, when Jeb Bush was governor, state authorities conducted a deeply flawed purge of voters before the presidential election in 2000"" and ""in 2004 a plan to purge even more voters was headed off."" Clinton omits that this effort started before Bush was in office, though it did continue under his watch. In 2004, the state scrapped another purge after officials admitted errors. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. So we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jun/09/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-revisits-floridas-2000-and-2004-vo/

Perry called Clinton’s claim ""way outside the norm of ridiculous"" on CNN’s State of the Union a few days later. ""I could probably find a federal judge to say just about anything,"" he stated. We did not hear back from the Perry campaign, so we delved into the law’s mired legal history. Senate Bill 14 is the law Clinton is referring to. It requires Texas voters to present a limited number of acceptable government-issued photo IDs at the ballot box; gun licenses count while student IDs don’t. The Texas Legislature passed the bill in March 2011, and Perry signed it into law on May 27. The law was in limbo for two years, until the Supreme Court struck down a section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on June 23, 2013. The section had mandated federal pre-approval of election laws in Texas and eight other states that historically discriminated against minority voters. With the court ruling, states could move ahead with changes. That same day, then-Texas Attorney General and current Gov. Greg Abbott announced the law would ""take effect immediately."" A few months later, in October 2013, federal Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos struck down the voter ID law in a consolidated suit filed against the state by U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, the NAACP, and the Mexican American Legislative Council. ""The court holds that SB 14 creates a substantial burden on the fundamental right to vote, has a discriminatory effect and purpose, and constitutes a poll tax,"" Ramos wrote in her ruling. ""The evidence in the record demonstrates that proponents of SB 14 … were motivated, at the very least in part, because of and not merely in spite of the voter ID law’s detrimental effects on the African-American and Hispanic electorate."" Ramos’ injunction against the voter ID law was temporarily stayed by the Fifth Circuit of Appeals, which permitted the law to remain in place in Texas for the 2014 midterm elections. That ruling was backed by the Supreme Court. The case is now back at the Fifth Circuit, which heard oral arguments in April 2015. So the law’s ultimate fate is still unknown. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Former Gov. Rick Perry signed a law that a federal court said was actually written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters."" The law in question requires a photo ID from Texas voters and was greenlit by Perry in 2011. Federal judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos struck the law down in 2013. While that ruling was stayed by two higher courts, Ramos clearly described the law as discriminatory in her ruling. However, it's important to note that courts are still considering whether or not the law will be allowed to stand.   Clinton’s carefully worded statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True. Clarification, June 10, 2015: We revised the wording of the decisions from the Fifth Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court to clarify that the two higher courts did not overturn Ramos' ruling. They temporarily stayed Ramos' injunction against Texas' voter ID law.",/factchecks/2015/jun/09/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-rick-perry-signed-law-intended-dis/

Hillary Clinton says Chris Christie vetoed early voting
","2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton went after Republicans by name for repeatedly restricting voting rights in a policy speech at Texas Southern University on June 4, 2015. She singled out several Republican governors who are also potential presidential candidates. Among them was New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who ""vetoed legislation to extend early voting,"" according to Clinton. Christie called Clinton’s accusation ""ridiculous,"" on CBS’s Face the Nation a few days later. ""She doesn't know what she's talking about,"" he said. ""The fact is that folks in New Jersey have plenty of an opportunity to vote."" Christie has a point that voters in New Jersey could vote before Election Day. But Clinton is right that Christie nixed a plan to ""extend"" early voting. We’ll explain. Under New Jersey election law, you can vote early through absentee ballot, but that’s not the same thing as early voting, which experts told us typically means casting your ballot in-person at a limited number of polling locations before election day. With absentee voting, Garden State voters can send their ballots via mail or drop it off in person at an election official’s office as early as 45 days before polls open. After Hurricane Sandy in 2012, New Jersey witnessed several logistical polling issues around the state on Election Day. So Democratic lawmakers proposed adding the typical in-person early voting option. Under their bill, S2364, a limited amount of polling locations would open for 14 days leading up to Election Day. The New Jersey Legislature passed the bill in March 2013 and sent it to Christie, who threw it out. Christie’s spokesman referred us to his veto message. ""This bill risks the integrity and orderly administration of our elections by introducing a new voting method and process,"" Christie wrote. ""Taxpayers should not have to foot a more than $25 million bill to pay for a hasty, counterproductive, and less reliable system, especially when New Jersey’s current early voting process is reliable and cost effective."" Christie’s and Clinton’s definitions of early voting differ. And while there’s no legally or universally recognized definition for the term, experts say Clinton’s is more widely used. ""Technically, New Jersey voters can vote early, but it's not what early voting systems look like around the country. It looks like the absentee ballot system,"" said Wendy Weiser, an election law expert at the Brennan Center for Justice. Hans von Spakovsky, an election law expert at the Heritage Foundation, agreed but noted that, in his opinion, ""Absentee balloting is actually easier than early voting, since you can do everything from your home."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""In New Jersey, Gov. Christie vetoed legislation to extend early voting."" In 2012, state legislators passed a bill that would have added early, in-person voting to New Jersey’s existing absentee ballot mail-in system. While the legislation wouldn’t have extended the time period for early voting, it would have given voters more ways to vote before Election Day. Christie rejected the bill, saying the existing system worked fine. We’re not weighing in here on whether the new system was better, but we do find that Clinton was careful in how she worded her claim. The proposal would have extended early voting, and Christie vetoed it. We rate her statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jun/09/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-chris-christie-voting-early-voting/

47% say they lack ready cash to pay a surprise $400 bill
","The economic struggles of ordinary Americans are getting a good airing this presidential season and a statistical finding from the Federal Reserve provides ammunition for a candidate in either party who wants to make the case that too many people have been left behind. Washington Post reporter Hunter Schwarz plugged some Fed data into a little segment called ""By the numbers"", in the newspaper’s June 8, 2015, edition: ""47: The percentage of Americans who can’t pay for an unexpected $400 expense through savings or credit cards, without selling something or borrowing money, according to the Federal Reserve."" The dollar figure caught our eye. It seemed surprisingly low. Other researchers have tried to gauge the financial vulnerability of American households to an economic setback, but typically, the amounts they test are much higher, in the thousands of dollars. We thought we’d take a closer look. The Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking A few years ago, the Federal Reserve Board began asking Americans how well they’re doing financially. In May, the Fed released the 2014 results. The questions ranged from retirement planning, to how people managed any student debt they might have, to whether they think their overall situation is headed up or down. To measure participants’ sense of financial vulnerability, the survey asked them to imagine they had an emergency expense that cost $400, and it asked them how they would cover it. The better-off group said they would use cash-on-hand or a credit card that they would pay off in a month. Others said they would use a credit card but take time to pay it off, or they might borrow from a family member or a pay-day loan company, or they might sell something. And some said there was no way they could cover an unexpected $400 expense. Across the more than 5,800 people who completed the online survey, 53 percent said they would be able to pay essentially immediately. That left 47 percent who said they could not. ""Specifically, respondents indicate that they simply could not cover the expense (14 percent); would sell something (10 percent); or would rely on one or more means of borrowing to pay for at least part of the expense, including paying with a credit card that they pay off over time (18 percent), borrowing from friends or family (13 percent), or using a payday loan (2 percent),"" the report said.  Interestingly, making over $100,000 a year was no guarantee of security. About a quarter of the more affluent group said that at the very least, they would pay off the $400 over time. As this chart from the report shows, ethnicity and income strongly affected the ability to absorb a $400 outlay.  Other studies George Washington University business professor Annamaria Lusardi and two colleagues (Daniel J. Schneider at Princeton University and Peter Tufano at Oxford University) conducted a similar survey in the depths of the recession in 2009. Their study asked people how they would handle a sudden $2,000 bill that they had to pay in 30 days. About half the respondents said they would probably or certainly be unable to cope with such an emergency out of their own funds. Lusardi said she considers the results comparable. ""The Federal Reserve had a lower amount, but it had to be paid right away,"" she told PunditFact. ""We gave people more time, so I think the percentages are consistent."" In fact, even with five years separating the surveys, it is the similarity in the responses that caught her eye. Lusardi said it is a sign of the recession’s deep damage to the typical American’s balance sheet. ""Until recently, the labor market and wages have been stagnant,"" Lusardi said. ""In the recession, many families used up their reserves of liquidity. It takes a long time to reestablish a good financial situation."" There are other indications that most Americans live with a limited financial cushion. When the government shutdown for two weeks in 2013, a University of Michigan research team tracked a hefty drop in household spending among government workers. Even though their paychecks were interrupted only a short time, households cut their outlays in half, and many delayed paying their mortgages and credit card bills. Some racked up high cost credit card debt that took them up to nine months to pay back. Lusardi’s 2009 research included a number of other western nations. For the record, the United States ranked sixth out of eight in residents saying they would certainly or probably be able to manage a sudden $2,000 bill. Rank/Country Percent able to cope Rank/Country Percent able to cope 1. Italy 80.1 5. Portugal 54.1 2. Netherlands 73.2 6. United States 50 3. Canada 71.7 7. Germany 49.4 4. France 62.8 8. United Kingdom 47.8   Our ruling Schwarz said 47 percent of Americans can’t pay for an unexpected $400 expense through savings or credit cards, without selling something or borrowing money. The only caveat here, and it’s a very minor one, is that figure represents the number of people who say they can’t make that payment, based on a Federal Reserve Board survey. The Federal Reserve Board results are in line with a similar study and related research. We rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2015/jun/09/hunter-schwarz/47-say-they-lack-ready-cash-pay-surprise-400-bill/

Austin yard signs suggest office tower project could drive up traffic 500 percent
","A chunk of residential Northwest Austin has bridled at the prospect of a low-rise office park becoming much more. Our attention was drawn to yard signs suggesting the towering redevelopment at the southwest corner of Spicewood Springs Road and MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) would quintuple area traffic.   Dallas-based Spire Realty Group LP seeks a zoning change to build up Austin Oaks, an office complex with 12 buildings of two to three stories each. In a version of its proposal made public in 2014, Spire said that on the parts of the site closer to MoPac, it wanted to build two office buildings of 17 stories each, though those plans have since been trimmed to 10-story buildings or so, according to Steve Drenner, an Austin lawyer representing Spire in its zoning case.   Initial plans, also since modified per Drenner, called for up to 610 apartments and townhomes in the three- to five-story buildings, plus retail and restaurant space. The soonest construction was planned to start was around 2020, after existing office leases expire.   The ""500%"" signs don’t reveal any group or person as the originator or sponsor. By phone, Ann Denkler, a volunteer with a coalition opposing the redevelopment, told us the group did not create them.   City 'unable to verify' traffic impact   We reached out to city officials at first, wondering what data were available. By email, spokeswoman Sylvia Arzola told us: ""The project and the traffic impact analysis are currently under review. At this time we are unable to verify the traffic impact until a full evaluation of the project and accompanying mitigation is provided by the developer.""   Meanwhile, we found something close to the 500 percent claim in a September 2014 presentation by Jim Duncan of Austin, a city planner by profession. Duncan said he developed the presentation at the urging of a neighborhood friend and based his traffic projection on an engineering report written by another firm at the developer’s request. That report, Duncan said,  indicated daily car trips near the proposed Austin Oaks Planned Use Development would increase from 4,118 to 23,804 once the expansion was finished--a 478 percent uptick.   We turned back to Arzola, who agreed by email it looks like the traffic figures indeed came from ""the developer’s consultant’s study."" However, she noted, a fresh traffic analysis was released in May 2015 based on the developer changing what it seeks to build.   Duncan said he’d heard the revision talk and for that reason, he said, his calculation of the potential 478 percent increase in daily car trips near the project would likely be outflanked. ""I’m sure the number is lower"" now, Duncan said.   Traffic impact studies   Arzola emailed us two traffic studies for the project, dated a year apart, and another city official, Bryan Golden, emailed us excerpts from a study completed in August 2014 (which looked to us like the one Duncan relied on). Each study presents predicted  ""unadjusted daily trips"" in the area should the project be built out with predicted increases ranging from more than 300 percent to more than 480 percent.   Generally, ""unadjusted daily trips"" means daily car trips in an area, a city official told us, without reductions accounting for trips internal to a development, say, or trips there on city buses. An unadjusted count rolls in trips expected due to existing developments plus the additional trips expected once the project is finished, Bryan Golden told us by email. The projections are generated by an engineering industry ""calculator,"" Golden said.   The initial June 26, 2014, traffic impact analysis was completed by a professional engineer, Bobak J. Tehrany, for Bury-AUS, Inc. That analysis, of 14 nearby intersections and 11 proposed driveways, said the redevelopment on completion in 2031 would generate an additional 20,736 unadjusted daily trips by car compared to some 4,248 daily trips attributed to the existing office complex — which breaks out to an eventual 488 percent increase.   With the redevelopment, Tehrany wrote, all but two of the nearby intersections would need improvements. That is, he said, ""the maximum desirable volumes are currently being exceeded along the roadway segments which were evaluated,"" though he also said that doesn’t mean the roadways had exceeded their respective capacities.   The Aug. 19, 2014, traffic impact analysis--taking into account a nearby intersection the city wanted to add to the analysis, Amanda Swor of Drenner’s firm told us by email--suggested the project would result in nearly 19,700 additional unadjusted daily car trips, up 478 percent from 4,118 of late. We didn’t get a fix on why the count of current-day traffic went down.   Most recently, the May 22, 2015, traffic impact analysis filed on behalf of the developers states: ""Based on the proposed land use intensities, it is anticipated that the development will generate a total of 19,819 unadjusted daily trips; however, due to the existing office land uses, the proposed redevelopment is anticipated to generate a net increase of 15,701 unadjusted daily trips. This is taking into consideration the trips which already exist on the roadway network due to the existing development.""   That is, once the development is done, nearby traffic would be up 381 percent from the 4,118 daily car trips of late.   Developer's advocate says traffic likely to increase less   By phone, Drenner pointed out the May 2015 analysis includes a chart suggesting that once adjustments are made to account for car trips internal to the development, there would actually be a 332 percent increase in traffic. He said this latest analysis was based on Spire’s modified development plan—halving the number of residential units and reducing retail uses — filed with the city April 30, 2015. Drenner said, too, the developers are suggesting $1.5 million in spending to improve nearby streets and creation of a fund that would accumulate money for area road improvements.   Next, we wondered how much traffic near the site would increase if the developers added nothing. Denkler and Golden counseled that analysts assume a 2 percent annual increase in car trips. At our request, Golden calculated the 4,118 current unadjusted daily car trips would escalate 37 percent to 5,653 in 2031--again, provided there’s no expansion on the site.   Our ruling   Yard signs posted in opposition to a proposed Northwest Austin redevelopment say: ""500 percent more traffic?""   Traffic studies filed in 2014 based on the developer’s original proposal support the 500-percent figure, yet the developer later submitted a revised plan and its May 2015 traffic analysis suggests at most a 381 percent increase in daily car trips, still a substantial spike.   Perhaps the project and predicted traffic effects will continue to change. For now, taking into account the information available when the signs were made, we rate the claim Mostly True.

Jeb Bush says he cut 13,000 state workforce jobs as governor
","Before announcing that he was going to announce his presidential candidacy, former Gov. Jeb Bush told a crowd at an Orlando event that he was dedicated to conservative principles like reducing the size of government.   ""We reduced the government workforce by 13,000, 11 percent, during my eight years,"" he said on June 2, 2015, at Gov. Rick Scott’s Economic Growth Summit at Walt Disney World. He also touted high job-creation numbers during his term. Bush is expected to officially announce his candidacy on June 15. Meanwhile, we wondered whether his claim about shrinking the state government workforce passed muster. Working through the cuts Bush served two terms between 1999 and the start of 2007, and proposed cutting 25 percent of state employees early in his term. He didn’t cut that many, but he did oversee a reduction in state workers. His Right to Rise PAC sent us state payroll numbers from Bush’s tenure that backed the claim. A Bush spokesman said the data came from the Legislature’s General Appropriations Act (i.e., the approved state budget) each year, minus workers for the State University System and temporary employees for which the governor’s office isn’t responsible. These are legitimate numbers, but can be hard to parse. To find them in the annual budget, which usually clocks in at more than 400 pages, you’d have to add them up from the positions listed for each state agency. You can sift through each budget if you’d like, but we decided to look at it a slightly different way to make it a little simpler for you to gauge, using the state’s Department of Management Services Annual Workforce Report. That’s a general snapshot of state personnel, how much they make and what jobs they do. Part of that count is the State Personnel System, which includes about two-thirds of state employees in more than 30 different agencies and departments. It also excludes university and temporary jobs, and a few others. The numbers aren’t exactly the same as what Bush’s PAC provided, but the State Personnel System shows who is employed by state agencies at any given time.  Year General Appropriations Act State Personnel System employees 1998-99 127,363 124,838 1999-2000 126,723 124,160 2000-01 125,007 123,505 2001-02 120,091 120,581 2002-03 117,869 117,561 2003-04 116,797 115,504 2004-05 116,317 113,030 2005-06 116,463 108,706 2006-07 113,633 108,866 Total change -13,730 -15,972 Percent change -10.8 percent -12.8 percent Either way you slice it, Bush can claim the state workforce he had a say over did shrink during his tenure, generally in the terms he noted. The Annual Workforce Report has the added bonus of keeping track of how many employees an agency gains or loses each year. That shows that departments like Children and Families, Health, and Corrections all lost plenty of positions under Bush, who focused on privatizing state services. That privatization of government work has been controversial. For example, contractors working for the Department of Children and Families have been criticized for cost overruns and running an ineffective, or even dangerous, privatized foster care program. Similar problems have been debated for contracts with payroll services and privately run prisons, among others. Florida International University public administration professors Howard Frank and David Guo said that instead of focusing on how many state jobs were eliminated, it’s better to consider whether the moves really saved the state money. The Department of Management Services doesn’t dissect the differences between jobs that were cut and the contracts that replaced them. That makes it difficult to untangle exactly how much the state may have saved by privatizing, automating or consolidating government positions. The state now has the lowest number of government workers per capita in the United States. But Bush’s workforce cuts between 1999 and 2007 came as the state’s population ballooned by about 3.5 million and the budget jumped from $48.6 billion to $73.9 billion. Our ruling Bush said, ""We reduced the government workforce by 13,000, 11 percent, during my eight years."" He was referring to a specific count of workers in state agencies cut between 1999 and 2007, and in context we can consider his numbers pretty accurate. Experts told us it’s important to keep in mind that privatizing state jobs or cutting positions doesn’t mean it’s necessarily cheaper or better for taxpayers. The statement, however, is accurate, and we rate it True. ",/factchecks/2015/jun/09/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-he-cut-13000-state-workforce-jobs-go/
"['Georgia', 'County Budget', 'Taxes', 'Lee May']","
Claim about DeKalb finances hits mark
","When the Great Recession battered property values, counties across metro Atlanta responded to plunging revenues by raising tax rates. Cobb raised rates 16 percent, DeKalb by 26 percent and Gwinnett by 21 percent in recent years. DeKalb County also dipped into its reserves to balance its budget and paid another price: it ended fiscal year 2011 without a cent in that rainy day fund. So it made news when interim DeKalb CEO Lee May announced last week that property values had rebounded enough that, the county’s reserve funds, taken together, now cover one month’s operating expense, as recommended by the state as well as county policy. ""Our reserves are now in much better shape than they were just a few years ago,"" May said. PolitiFact Georgia was intrigued. Did DeKalb’s fund balance – the budget jargon for the reserves – really swell from nothing to a projected $57.5 million in four years? The history Such a financial turnaround would be a much needed boost to the county, where suspended CEO Burrell Ellis is about to be retried on charges he extorting campaign cash from companies that do work for the county. In the two years since the initial indictment, a county commissioner has begun serving a 14-month sentence for defrauding taxpayers of more than $100,000, a former member of the county’s Zoning Board of Appeals pleaded guilty in February to taking a bribe for his vote and the former county school superintendent pleaded guilty to misdemeanor obstruction in a racketeering case. In the midst of that, the county also has struggled financially. The net value of all taxable property in DeKalb County tumbled from $24 billion in 2010 to $21 billion in 2011, according to the county’s consolidation sheets. When the county revealed it had spent all of its rainy day fund to make ends meet in 2011, national bond rating agencies took note. The agencies downgraded DeKalb’s credit score, meaning taxpayers paid higher interest rates on borrowing for major projects. As recently as November 2013, Fitch Ratings said it still had concerns about the depleted reserves even as the county slowly tried to rebuild them. County audits show the slow growth, including adjustments made in 2014 when the county switched its reserve accounting from cash on hand to modified accrual, so that all bills were paid with funds from the year they were charged: Year End Reserves Goal Percentage 2010 -$4.5 million $45 million -.10% 2011 $30 million $44 milion 68% 2012 $41.5 million $45 million 92% 2013 $42 million $45 million 93% 2014 $49 million $48 million 102% 2015 $57.5 million $48 million 120% Source: County audits, 2015 midyear budget recommendations A main challenge was that property values stayed low. Last year that net taxable value – called the digest – remained effectively the same as 2011, at $20.2 billion, according to data from the county property appraiser. The change for 2015: The total gross value is projected to be $24.7 billion by year’s end, with a net value of $22 billion. That increase is projected to bring in another $36 million in revenue this year. May’s midyear budget adjustment calls for the county to spend $12.7 million of that money on items such as body cameras for police officers. But May wants the rest, nearly $23 million, to be put into reserves. ""We had dipped into our reserves to make ends meet, which cost us our credit rating. We have spent every year since trying to restore that,"" said county spokesman Burke Brennan. ""It’s our greatest single allocation from the increase from the economic recovery, but we will accomplish our goal."" There are two caveats to that claim. One is detailed. May’s proposed budget adjustment shows that two of the five active tax funds – the fund set aside for fire service and unincorporated reserve that takes money from Recorders Court and business licenses  – will fall below that one month goal. Only when the police reserve, designated reserve for roads and parks and the general fund reserve are added in does the overall reserve reach the 1.2 month of expenditures. Rating agencies will look at the both the individual funds and the combined total reserve in their reviews. Michael Rinaldi, a senior director for Fitch who is the primary analyst for DeKalb, said that agency would consider police and fire reserves to be for essential services but would also look holistically. ""They have been moving in the right direction,"" Rinaldi said. ""We certainly look at the trend, and if there would be a strain for the general fund to cover any deficits. In this case, that is generally not an issue."" The second asterisk relates to the process itself. May’s claim is based on his proposed budget adjustments. But the Board of County Commissioners has final say on those adjustments and may make changes before a vote in July. Our ruling May claimed that his mid-year budget would leave the county’s reserve funds in better shape than they have been in years. Considering in 2011, there was no money in that rainy day fund, improvement wouldn’t be difficult. But budget and audit figures show May’s proposal would restore the overall reserves to a goal of one month’s expenditures.

Bobby Jindal's change of position on Common Core
","Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal isn’t expected to announce his candidacy for president until June 24, but he’s already firing shots at future competitors. In response to Sen. Rand Paul’s comments in late May on the origins of ISIS, Jindal called him ""outlandish,"" ""illogical,"" and ""unsuited to be Commander-in-Chief."" Paul advisor Doug Stafford shot back at Jindal, saying, ""It’s ironic Gov. Jindal would level such a charge when he flip-flops on crucial issues like Common Core and national security, and he has cratered his own state’s economy and budget."" This is not the first time critics have accused of Jindal for doing a 180 on Common Core — the state-based educational standards aimed at improving student readiness for college and the workplace. (Read our past fact-checks of claims and flips relating to Common Core.) In light of his upcoming candidacy, we wondered: How does Jindal’s position on Common Core register on our Flip-O-Meter? It’s important to note that we are not making a value judgment about flip-flopping; we're just noting whether a change of position has occurred. Jindal support Common Core was launched in June 2009 as a collaboration between 49 states and territories. Louisiana adopted the standards in 2010 with Jindal’s blessing. In 2012, he handpicked John White, a strong supporter of Common Core, as state superintendent of education. At an event for business leaders in January of that year, Jindal lauded the Common Core standards as a step forward for education in his state that ""will raise expectations for every child."" Jindal echoed the sentiment early into his second term. Jindal stood by Common Core at a groundbreaking ceremony in 2013, amid an ongoing fight over the standards in his state and even after the Republican National Committee renounced the program. Though he never mentioned the initiative by name, Jindal said that ""too many"" governors, teachers, students and parents ""have fought too hard for too many years to put Louisiana on that map (toward more rigorous education standards). And we're not going backwards."" Then, he disowned the initiative. Jindal opposition Jindal himself acknowledges his change of heart, which he says is due to the federal government’s stepping in. His spokesperson Mike Reed told us, ""Gov. Jindal supported (Common Core) when he believed it to be a state-led effort. Later, when he discovered it was a centralized federal effort, he opposed it and began working to remove Common Core from Louisiana."" We’ve fact-checked several statements that suggest Common Core is a federal program or mandate. It’s not. States can improve their chances of winning federal money if they adopt educational standards; the Obama administration included that as criteria for its ""Race to the Top"" program. But Common Core itself remains a state-based, voluntary program. Nevertheless, by April 2014, Jindal was clearly in the opposition camp. ""I'm from the school that believes education is a matter best left for local control,"" Jindal wrote in an op-ed for USA Today. ""The notion of Washington determining curricula is something most states are simply not interested in. It's a non-starter."" A month later, Jindal grew more emphatic in his distaste for Common Core, comparing it to centralized planning in Russia. He also tweeted: We will not be bullied by fed govt. Common Core advocates claim it not a fed takeover, but Sec. Duncan's comments & actions prove otherwise. Beyond rhetoric, Jindal has actively tried to rock the schoolhouse standards. He sued the Obama administration over the national implementation of Common Core in 2014 (and he’s been sued for his repudiation). He asked Common Core to withdraw from the state. He broke with his own education head, an ""exceptional"" and ""unusual"" move, according to Ashley Jochim, who studies Common Core at the Center for Reinventing Public Education. He proposed an opt-out option for students in early 2015. He issued an executive order to repeal Common Core in Louisiana in 2014 and came up with a legislative plan as well. In late May, Jindal signed off on a compromise between Louisiana legislators that allows state review and revision of the federal standards with public oversight. But, according to his spokesperson, that doesn’t mean Jindal’s done with his efforts to permanently give Common Core the boot in the Bayou. ""We support the compromise because it ensures we have local control going forward. The next step will be to elect leaders who are committed to getting rid of Common Core,"" Reed told us, noting that Jindal’s lawsuit against the Obama administration is moving forward. Experts say there’s no question Jindal reversed his position on Common Core. ""Gov. Jindal has clearly flip-flopped on the issue. He went from singing the praises of Common Core to leading the charge for removing the standards in Louisiana. Because of Jindal, the state has made almost a complete U-turn on the standards,"" said James Shuls, a professor of education and policy at the University of Missouri in St. Louis. Jindal’s change of position has also been noted by CNN, the Huffington Post, the Washington Times, the Washington Post’s editorial board and the Times-Picayune. Our rating Jindal was once an ardent supporter of Common Core (and one of the first adopters of the initiative) but has since become one of its staunchest critics, mounting lawsuits and legislation against the initiative. Despite his endorsement of a compromise in his state, Jindal remains an opponent to the core.

Dr. Phil’s faulty point about the coronavirus and swimming pools
","Celebrity psychologist Phil McGraw, known to his TV viewers as ""Dr. Phil,"" argued for reopening the economy on Fox News, rattling off a string of statistics about other causes of death that don’t require statewide shutdowns. McGraw’s figures were not all accurate, however, and the comparisons he drew with the novel coronavirus weren't apples-to-apples. ""The fact of the matter is, we have people dying — 45,000 people a year die from automobile accidents, 480,000 from cigarettes, 360,000 a year from swimming pools,"" McGraw told Fox News host Laura Ingraham. ""But we don’t shut the country down for that.""  It didn’t take long for us to see where McGraw was right, and where he was wrong. And McGraw later said he offered ""bad examples."" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cigarette use is responsible for over 480,000 U.S. deaths per year, as McGraw said. The talk show host slightly overstated the number of deaths due to motor vehicle crashes, which the CDC reported as 40,231 in 2017. But McGraw was wildly off when it came to deaths in swimming pools.  The CDC tallied 3,709 deaths from accidental drowning or submersion in 2017, the most recent year with data available. Between 2005 and 2014, there were 3,536 unintentional deaths by drowning per year on average, plus an additional 332 from drowning in boat-related incidents.  Not all drownings occur in swimming pools. According to the CDC, more than half of fatal and nonfatal drownings among people 15 years and older occur in natural water, such as lakes or the ocean. Drowning can also occur in bathtubs. In an April 17 video on Facebook and Instagram Live, McGraw said he ""misspoke"" about drowning deaths. He said he was citing the worldwide number, which is 320,000 deaths per year, according to the World Health Organization.  That’s still 40,000 fewer deaths than what he originally said. And the problems go beyond the number. As we’ve reported, comparisons like McGraw’s can be misleading. The coronavirus, which had led to roughly 34,000 U.S. deaths as of April 17, is infectious and contagious. Drowning is not. RELATED: Understanding the scale of potential coronavirus deaths McGraw’s comparison ignores that other, more predictable causes of death are ""spread out throughout the year, and we’ve built up the capacity to manage them,"" said Arthur Caplan, the founding head of the division of medical ethics at the New York University School of Medicine. ""That comparison is ridiculous, ill-grounded, and actually dangerous,"" Caplan said. ""The issue isn’t how many people die of car crashes or swimming pool accidents or strokes or whatever. The question is whether they all happen at once and overwhelm the health care system."" RELATED: Hannity wrong that health care system is ready as is for coronavirus Other experts have told us comparisons like McGraw’s also downplay the coronavirus’ risk of exponential spread — and the importance of mitigation efforts in reducing that risk.  The Imperial College of London estimated in mid March that if the U.S. did absolutely nothing to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the country could see as many as 2.2 million deaths — a number President Donald Trump has pointed to as proof that his efforts have been successful. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has called comparisons between the coronavirus and traffic accidents a ""false equivalency,"" noting that the coronavirus ""is emerging, and you really can’t predict totally the impact it’s going to have.""  McGraw acknowledged that the comparison wasn’t perfect on Facebook and Instagram Live. A spokesperson for the ""Dr. Phil"" TV show pointed us to those remarks when we asked for a comment. ""Last night, I said we as a society have chosen to live with certain controllable deadly risks everyday — smoking, auto crashes, swimming,"" he said. ""And yes, I know that those are not contagious, so probably bad examples, probably bad examples."" McGraw said there are ""360,000 (deaths) a year from swimming pools, but we don’t shut the country down for that."" For one thing, that’s too many zeros. There were 3,709 U.S. deaths from accidental drowning or submersion in 2017.  McGraw has since said he was citing the worldwide number for drowning deaths, and that his comparisons were ""probably bad examples."" The coronavirus is infectious and contagious, and the count of deaths from drowning is spread over a year.  We rate his original statement False. ",/factchecks/2020/apr/17/phil-mcgraw/dr-phils-faulty-point-about-coronavirus-and-swimmi/

What the 1918 flu pandemic shows us about social distancing
","Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home orders prompted conservatives to organize protests, but Whitmer said she will base decisions on how and when to relax Michigan’s social distancing guidelines on facts and science. At a press conference April 15, Whitmer said that the protests where people gathered without masks in close proximity ""may have just created a need to lengthen it, which is something that we’re trying to avoid at all costs."" Whitmer said she is working with experts in health care and other sectors to create a data-driven approach to reopening the state. ""I want to be very clear that our decision to re-engage sectors is going to be based on the best facts and the best science, and what facts and science have told us is that re-engaging our state too soon or too fast will lead to a second wave of COVID-19 in Michigan,"" she said. ""During the flu pandemic of 1918, some cities lifted social distancing measures too fast, too soon, and created a second wave of pandemic."" Whitmer said that as a result of lifting social distancing measures too fast in 1918, many cities had to revert to quarantines and ""suffered a lot of additional deaths.""  We will explain the source of her data, which comes from an academic paper in 2007.  The influenza pandemic of 1918 spread worldwide and killed at least 50 million people, including about 675,000 in the United States. Since there was no vaccine for the virus and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections, control efforts were largely limited to social distancing and quarantines, which were applied unevenly. During her press conference, Whitmer pointed to a chart by National Geographic, which displayed the findings of a 2007 study about the death rates in 43 cities during the 1918 pandemic. The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and written by researchers from the University of Michigan Medical School and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Two of the authors summarized their findings in the Washington Post in April. ""The experience of 1918 also reminds us that early, layered (i.e., more than one at the same time) and lengthy mitigation measures are the best strategy. For social distancing to work, it must be sweeping and enforced across a wide swath of the community,"" wrote Howard Markel and J. Alexander Navarro. The researchers examined social distancing in 43 cities during about 24 weeks in 1918-19. Public gathering bans typically meant the closure of saloons, public entertainment venues and sporting events. Indoor gatherings were banned or moved outdoors.  Researchers found that cities that implemented social distancing in a timely and comprehensive manner and sustained those rules suffered the least. St. Louis, for example, implemented a relatively early, layered strategy that included school closures and the cancellation of public gatherings. It sustained those interventions for about 10 weeks and did not experience nearly as harmful an outbreak as 36 other communities.  Conversely, Philadelphia held a massive Liberty Bond Parade to bolster the World War I effort. That led to a spike of thousands of flu cases within days. In Atlanta, the mayor sided with the business community and ended closures after three weeks, despite objections from the board of health. The epidemic raged in Atlanta. Researchers documented public pressure to end social distancing as soon as the flu seemed to peak and ebb. Cities then lifted the measures, and people lined up for movies and packed into dance halls and shopping districts. ""The result? Cases and deaths resurged. Most cities closed their schools once again,"" the researchers wrote.  Researchers noted caveats including that there could be errors in the historical record and the difficulties in interpreting data from 90 years ago.  Navarro, one of the study authors, told PolitiFact that the study shows that communities must be very careful about removing social distancing restrictions too soon. Social distancing flattens the curve, but it doesn’t end the epidemic. It ends when a community  reaches hard immunity through vaccine or antibody reaction from infection. A separate paper published in 2007 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences examined 17 U.S. cities during the flu pandemic. It found that cities in which interventions were implemented early had peak death rates about 50% lower than those that did not. It concluded that social distancing and other measures ""can significantly reduce influenza transmission, but that viral spread will be renewed upon relaxation of such measures."" It’s tricky to compare lifting restrictions ""too early"" with ""holding them for longer,"" said Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard epidemiologist and one of the co-authors of the National Academy of Sciences paper. In either case, there will be some amount of resurgence once social distancing is let up. A recent paper he co-authored in Science suggested that a single period of distancing could not permanently solve the problem; prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022. ""So overall, the problem is that it's not short vs. long, but single vs. repeated (or some other strategy such as a vaccine),"" he told PolitiFact. On April 15, President Donald Trump said he thinks some states can open up before May 1. Many scientists have warned that ending the interventions prematurely will lead to more deaths. Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, told the Associated Press on April 14 that the U.S. doesn’t yet have the contact tracing and testing needed to reopen the economy. He said Trump’s goal was a ""bit overly optimistic"" for parts of the country.  ""I’ll guarantee you, once you start pulling back there will be infections. It’s how you deal with the infections that’s going count,"" Fauci told the AP. Whitmer said, ""During the flu pandemic of 1918, some cities lifted social distancing measures too fast, too soon, and created a second wave of pandemic."" Typically, when social distancing ends, there is a second wave. The goal is to make the second wave as small as possible. Whitmer pointed to research from the University of Michigan in 2007 that found after social distancing rules ended in many cities, cases and deaths surged.  We rate this statement Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2020/apr/17/gretchen-whitmer/what-1918-flu-pandemic-shows-us-about-social-dista/

Michigan residents can still buy car seats in stores
","Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s aggressive steps to slow the spread of COVID-19 in her hard-hit state have earned her a lot of national attention.  Back home in Michigan, they’re stirring up complaints from conservatives who say the Democratic governor is overstepping her power or banning the sale of things they need.   On April 15, thousands of people clogged the streets of the state capital, Lansing, in their cars to protest the governor’s latest statewide stay-at-home order, which tightened restrictions on residents and businesses and extended them to April 30. The protest was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition. The governor is taking flak on social media, too, with critics claiming falsely that her order bans the sale of American flags and bug spray.  Untrue claims that Whitmer banned the sale of car seats for infants began circulating on social media soon after she issued the order, which required large stores to close off their garden centers and sections selling paint, flooring and furniture, but didn’t affect baby supplies. An April 10 Twitter post from Tori Sachs, executive director of the conservative group Michigan Rising Action, showed a picture of car seats at a Walmart roped off by yellow caution tape and a sign that said: ""By order of the State of Michigan, items in this ‘non-essential’ area are not available for purchase. Please use Walmart.com for your needs until further notice."" Sachs said in the tweet accompanying the photo: ""Per order from @GovWhitmer, people in Michigan are now banned from purchasing a new baby car seat in stores. This is dangerous and this order needs clarification immediately."" The photo was originally shared by a Facebook user before it was tweeted by Sachs. Another Facebook user posted about a Walmart in Big Rapids, Mich., refusing to sell her a car seat that was in a restricted area on April 10. Fortunately for Michiganders in the market for one, the governor’s executive order did not ban the sale of car seats. ""To be clear, the EO asks stores over 50K square feet to close down sections of their store to protect against unnecessary traffic, like garden centers, furniture, paint, carpet/flooring,"" a Whitmer spokesperson said April 12 in a statement to a local TV channel. ""Child car seats aren't in any of those categories."" The statement suggests the Michigan stores that instituted temporary bans on the sale of car seats misinterpreted a provision in Executive Order 2020-42 that required large stores to close off areas selling some products. The executive order says: ""For stores of more than 50,000 square feet: … Close areas of the store — by cordoning them off, placing signs in aisles, posting prominent signs, removing goods from shelves, or other appropriate means — that are dedicated to the following classes of goods: carpet or flooring; furniture; garden centers or plant nurseries; paint."" Whitmer tweeted links to a frequently-asked-questions page repeatedly on April 12 in an effort to correct the misunderstandings about the executive order. It says: Q: Does Executive Order 2020-42 ban the purchasing of car seats for children?  A: No. Car seats may be available for purchase. Whitmer also addressed the confusion and misinformation surrounding the order in an April 13 press conference and COVID-19 update. ""First and foremost, I want to be clear: Nothing in the stay-at-home order prohibits people from buying car seats for your children,"" she said. ""There’s no prohibition on that."" Whitmer encouraged people to be cautious about whether what they see on social media is people sharing facts or just ""political posturing."" Her office didn’t respond to requests for comment for this article. The average Walmart Supercenter is 187,000 square feet, meaning the Michigan Supercenters would need to adhere to the regulations about closing certain sections. But it is unclear why the two Michigan Walmarts cordoned off their car seats. Could it have been confusion about the term ""nurseries""? Walmart did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment, but the retail chain has since clarified its policy on the sale of car seats in Michigan. ""Michigan customers are able to purchase baby car seats, baby furniture and other infant products at their local Walmart,"" a Walmart representative told Business Insider in a statement. ""We are reiterating this direction with store management to ensure consistent service to our customers across our Michigan stores. Customers are also welcome to purchase these items from the convenience of their home through Walmart.com."" Sachs said on April 12 that she meant for her original tweet to raise awareness about the confusion Whitmer’s executive order caused throughout the state. ""My intention was for the order to be clarified so this didn't happen to another mom,"" Sachs said in a tweet. She added that after her tweet received media coverage and caught the attention of prominent public figures, Whitmer ""finally clarified."" Sachs tweeted: ""Per order from @GovWhitmer, people in Michigan are now banned from purchasing a new baby car seat in stores."" No part of the executive order bans the sale of car seats, but large stores are under orders to keep customers away from areas selling items in categories such as gardening, flooring and furniture. Two Michigan Walmarts cited the order in initially roping off and prohibiting the sale of car seats, but Walmart clarified for store managers that baby products can be sold in stores or online.

Is Joe Biden’s platform as progressive as Obama says?
","In his video endorsing Joe Biden for president, former President Barack Obama not only backed his former running mate but also offered an olive branch to supporters of Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who had challenged Biden from the left in this year’s primaries. In the April 14 video, Obama said: ""You know, I could not be prouder of the incredible progress that we made together during my presidency, but if I were running today, I wouldn’t run the same race or have the same platform as I did in 2008. The world is different; there’s too much unfinished business for us to just look backwards. We have to look to the future. Bernie understands that, and Joe understands that.  ""It is one of the reasons that Joe already has what is the most progressive platform of any major-party nominee in history. Because even before the pandemic turned the world upside down, it was already clear that we needed real structural change. The vast inequalities created by the new economy are easier to see now, but they existed long before this pandemic hit."" Is it accurate to say that Biden ""already has what is the most progressive platform of any major party nominee in history""?  The topic is somewhat murky, and after interviewing presidential historians we came up with the somewhat unsatisfying answer of ""yes and no.""  There is a plausible case for Biden as the most progressive Democratic nominee in history. Political scientists note that the Democratic Party as a whole has moved to the left in recent years. This is partly because of rising polarization between the parties. As conservative Democrats have increasingly left to become Republicans or independents, the remaining Democrats are clustered closer to the liberal end of the spectrum. Biden has heeded this leftward shift, just less aggressively than such primary rivals as Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.  On many issues during the 2020 primaries, such as gun policy, Biden’s positions were largely indistinguishable from those of his rivals. And on the issues where he did offer a more moderate vision than his Democratic primary opponents, such as health care and climate change, he still went further than Obama had during his presidency. On some issues, including health care, climate change and criminal justice reform, Biden has moved beyond Hillary Clinton in 2016. Biden backs some policies that few previous Democratic nominees would have considered backing. These include a $15 minimum wage, a study of reparations for slavery, two years free public college, ending new oil and gas leases on federal land and offshore, creation of a national firearm registry, and scrapping past marijuana convictions. (An exception is trade policy, where the Democratic mainstream has drifted in a more pro-trade direction in recent decades.) ""Biden has moved steadily in a progressive direction,"" said Max J. Skidmore, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and the author of Presidential Performance: A Comprehensive Review. These include promising to name a woman as his running mate and moving towards the Sanders and Warren positions on student debt and bankruptcy reform.  Skidmore also cited Biden’s support for eliminating private prisons, abolishing the death penalty, and providing paid family and medical leave. Another way to look at it is how the nominees’ stances compare with those of their general-election opponent. Walter Mondale faced Ronald Reagan in 1984; Michael Dukakis faced George H.W. Bush in 1988; and John Kerry faced George W. Bush in 2004. Each of these Democratic nominees positioned himself sharply to the left of his general-election opponent, but the difference between Biden and Donald Trump is at least as large, particularly on such issues as immigration. While Biden is ""less dramatically progressive"" than some of his 2020 primary rivals, Skidmore said, Biden’s contrast with Trump ""is absolutely dramatic. Does a Biden presidency promise to be more progressive than those of his predecessors? Yes — a resounding yes — in an absolute sense. He accepts, and would build on, all of their achievements, and add to them."" That said, there are a couple factors that make it hard to compare one nominee with another on ideology. The first problem is that on a historical scale, the concept of a most progressive (or most liberal, or most left-leaning) nominee is a moving target. For instance, in 1948, the Democrats called for a national health program, ""which would have been a more radical break with the status quo than what Biden is proposing, but in absolute terms would have landed to the right of where we are today,"" said H.W. Brands, a historian at the University of Texas-Austin who has written books about Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. ""That same 1948 platform called for eradicating all racial discrimination, which would have been a huge break with the Jim Crow system then in place. Nothing today could come close to that."" Franklin D. Roosevelt (Wikimedia Commons) Another example: Two decades ago, support for same-sex marriage ""was a very progressive idea, but today, it’s the law of the land, and few conservatives still challenge it,"" said John J. Pitney, Jr., a Claremont McKenna College political scientist. Any effort to determine the most liberal nominee is undercut by the reality that liberal goals that have already been accomplished can’t be accomplished again. Once Franklin Roosevelt enacted Social Security and once Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law, future nominees had to move on to new policy goals. But just because virtually all politicians today support these programs today doesn’t mean that today’s politicians are as liberal today as Roosevelt and Johnson were in their day. David Greenberg, a Rutgers University historian and author of ""Republic of Spin: An Inside History of the American Presidency"" and books about Calvin Coolidge and Richard Nixon, said Obama’s statement is ""without much meaning or value."" ""It’s not meaningful to try to compare whether a set of proposals from 2020 is more or less progressive than proposals from 1960 or 1900 or 1800,"" Greenberg said. ""In every era, the problems are different, the policy possibilities are different, and our understandings of what’s ‘progressive’ or ‘conservative’ are different."" The second problem with Obama’s assertion is that nominees may be more liberal on some issues and more moderate on others. ""Being progressive on class issues is different from being ‘woke’ on identity issues,"" said Jennifer Delton, a Skidmore College historian and author of ""Rethinking the 1950s: How Anticommunism and the Cold War Made America Liberal."" Indeed, candidates may choose to emphasize some parts of their agenda over others, changing how liberal or moderate they appear to be. Part of the candidate’s dance on these issues has to do with managing the differing demands of constituencies within the Democratic Party coalition.  ""As the Democratic Party has been moving leftward, Biden has been balancing between the pragmatic and idealistic left sides of his party,"" said Bert Rockman, an emeritus professor of political science at Purdue University who has written books assessing Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama. ""It probably is true that this might well be the most progressive platform the Democrats have had, but that doesn’t mean that Biden will emphasize all of it."" Where Obama’s assertion is on weaker ground is if you compare Biden’s platform not with an absolute measure of historical liberalism but in relation to his own party.  Past nominees of both parties have taken positions more at odds with the mainstream of their own party than he has. In 1972, for instance, George McGovern won the nomination as an insurgent candidate whose policy positions were to the left of where many in the party stood.  Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, and Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society programs were on the outer edge of what some party figures would have advocated, Skidmore said. If the question is, ""Is Biden pushing the envelope of what is possible?"" then the answer is no, Delton said. ""And most Democrats are fine with that,"" she said. There’s even a president who proposed such liberal initiatives as a guaranteed minimum income, controls on wages and prices, a more ambitious forerunner to the Affordable Care Act, and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. ""His name,"" Pitney said, ""was Richard M. Nixon."" Obama said that Biden ""already has what is the most progressive platform of any major party nominee in history.""  This is a complicated assertion to evaluate, because the nature of liberalism changes over time, making candidate-to-candidate comparisons difficult. But there’s evidence that both supports and undercuts Obama’s position. Obama is on the strongest ground if you compare Biden’s platform with an absolute concept of liberalism. Tracking ongoing shifts within his party, Biden has moved to the left compared with where Obama stood, and is further to the left than many prior Democratic nominees. Also, as more liberal policies are enacted, the next steps are necessarily more liberal. However, in his own time, Biden is hardly on his party’s ideological vanguard, unlike previous nominees such as McGovern.

Why are NC liquor stores considered essential?
","To limit the spread of coronavirus, authorities are asking some businesses to close and allowing some to stay open. That’s the case in North Carolina, where Gov. Roy Cooper has issued a stay-at-home order and deemed some businesses ""essential."" Gas stations, grocery stores and home supply stores like Home Depot are among the businesses considered essential and allowed to stay open.  North Carolina’s state-run liquor stores are also considered essential.  Why? NC state Sen. Jeff Jackson, a Democrat from Mecklenburg County, recently addressed that question on Twitter. ""Why are liquor stores still open?"" Jackson asked rhetorically in an April 6 tweet. ""It’s because we have a lot of people who are chemically dependent on alcohol and if we suddenly cut off their access they would go into withdrawal and flood the emergency rooms, which we can’t have right now,"" he said. Is that true? The governor’s office is in charge of designating which businesses are ""essential"" and allowed to stay open. But Cooper’s executive order didn’t offer a reason why liquor stores or any other businesses are considered essential. Kelly Haight Connor, spokeswoman for North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services, told PolitiFact in an email that the reasoning was simple. ""People need to stay home as much as possible. And while restaurants, bars and other areas of communal gathering must be closed, people should be able to buy items used in their day to day lives,"" she said. PolitiFact could find no proof that Cooper’s decision to designate liquor stores as essential businesses was made to accommodate people who might be dependent on alcohol.  Further, if liquor stores were hypothetically asked to close, North Carolinians could still access alcohol in the form of wine and beer at grocery stores. When we reached out to Jackson about this claim, his office noted that individual ABC boards across the state have the flexibility to decide whether or not they want to remain open. Jeff Strickland, a spokesman for the ABC Commission, confirmed each of the state’s 170 boards does, indeed, have that freedom. ""If a board wants to close down, they have that authority,"" Strickland said. The commission doesn’t have an official stance on why its stores should or shouldn’t remain open, he added. To that end, Jackson’s office pointed out that some ABC store operators have cited alcohol dependency as a reason for staying open. Jackson’s office emailed us an article by WLOS in Asheville, where local ABC manager Jason Thacker told WLOS that he’s heard concerns about overwhelming hospitals. ""Studies show that abruptly limiting access to alcohol could lead to an increase in withdrawal for people with severe alcohol use disorder and add to the burden of the health care system, which is the last thing that needs to happen right now,"" Thacker told WLOS. Jackson’s office also provided links to stories about why liquor stores are being kept open in other states such as Connecticut, New Jersey and Texas. In Connecticut, for example, Gov. Ned Lamont said there’s a medical reason behind the exemption for liquor stores. ""I think the thought process by the (Connecticut) governor is that if we do close the liquor stores this could create an unnecessary problem and really cut off a needed resource,"" Dr. Andrew Lim, the medical director of Bristol Hospital’s Emergency Department, told NBC News in Connecticut. However, addiction specialists aren’t unified in their belief that liquor store access will prevent emergency room admissions.  John Watkins, who owns Johnston Counseling Services, told WRAL that people who are physically dependent on alcohol could suffer withdrawal symptoms in less than a day if they can’t access it. But Ward Blanchard, president of The Blanchard Institute addiction recovery center in Charlotte, told Spectrum News that leaving ABC stores open could also lead to ER admissions. He said some who are dependent on alcohol could, if left alone with high volumes of it, go overboard. ""When you are in a situation where people are isolated and there is already stress and anxiety, and then you throw liquor on top of that, I think that would overthrow a healthcare system more so than closing it would,"" Blanchard said. Jackson said liquor stores are still open because ""we have a lot of people who are chemically dependent on alcohol and if we suddenly cut off their access they would go into withdrawal and flood the emergency rooms, which we can’t have right now."" Gov. Cooper is responsible for determining which businesses are considered essential, and his administration hasn’t mentioned alcohol dependency as a reason for the designation.  The only evidence Jackson cited was an ABC operations manager in Asheville who said some store owners are concerned about closures potentially affecting the hospital system. But it’s not clear that that concern is shared among all 170 ABC store owners. Jackson’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression about North Carolina’s Executive Order.

Is obesity a top risk factor in COVID-19 hospitalizations?
","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis plans to form a task force to look at reopening schools and businesses including gyms. DeSantis said he understands why there were recommendations to close gyms due to the spread of germs. But he expressed concern that people may not be getting enough physical activity amid the shutdowns. ""The No. 1 group of people who have been susceptible to COVID-19 if you look in New York and some of these other (places), obesity is, like, the No. 1 factor in whether you really get hit hard by COVID-19,"" he said at his April 14 press briefing. Overwhelming research shows age as the leading risk factor in the severity of the disease, however early research also shows that obesity is a risk factor in hospitalizations for COVID-19.  That’s a cause for concern in the United States, where 40% of the population is obese. Scientists have called attention to the research about obesity and COVID-19 because it’s another sign that age is not the only factor. We found a few studies that examine the role of obesity in COVID-19. These studies come with limitations, including that they were usually limited to a certain geographic region and may not include complete information on patients, such as outcomes after the study period. But they do provide a useful look at what we know so far about obesity and COVID-19. The studies we saw from New York were not yet peer-reviewed. Researchers at NYU Langone Health in New York City conducted two studies about obesity and COVID-19, among the largest examinations of COVID-19 patients to date. Most of the patients in the two studies overlap. The studies appear in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases and on the pre-publication website medRxiv.  One study, led by Dr. Christopher Petrilli, examined the factors associated with hospitalization and critical illness among 4,103 patients with COVID-19 for about one month. Nearly half of the patients were hospitalized. The study found that the strongest hospitalization risks were age over 75, obesity and history of heart failure, in that order. ""Age is the most important demographic factor for severity of disease and more important than any single disease, but obesity is among the most important diseases in terms of risk,"" Dr. Leora Horwitz, one of the authors, told PolitiFact. Researchers defined obese as a body-mass index of greater than 30. BMI is a measure of body fat based on a person’s height and weight. Normal weight is a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9. Among the 1,999 hospitalized patients, 33% had a BMI of 30-40 while about 7% had a BMI of more than 40. The rates were similar among those who faced critical illness — as defined by intensive care, mechanical ventilation, hospice and/or death. ""The chronic condition with the strongest association with critical illness was obesity, with a substantially higher odds ratio than any cardiovascular or pulmonary disease,"" researchers wrote. Obesity tends to increase risk for other conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, which are also risk factors for severe disease with COVID-19.  ""Separately, it does seem that the severe cases of COVID-19 have a strong component of inflammation — the body reacting (or overreacting) to the infection to cause severe irritation to the lungs,"" Horwitz told PolitiFact. ""It turns out that obesity itself actually increases the amount of inflammation in the body. So it's possible that obesity also directly contributes to worse outcomes in that way."" The other study by NYU Langone examined BMI stratified by age in COVID-19-positive symptomatic patients at the hospital. Researchers found that COVID-19 infected patients under age 60 with a BMI of 30-34 were twice as likely to be admitted to acute or critical care as those  at same age with BMIs less than 30. Those who were morbidly obese, defined as having a BMI greater than 35, were three times as likely be admitted to the ICU.  ""Though patients aged <60 years are generally considered a lower risk group of COVID-19 disease severity, based on data from our institution, obesity appears to be a previously unrecognized risk factor for hospital admission and need for critical care,"" researchers wrote.  In the study, 37% of patients who came to the emergency department had BMI greater than 30. In New York City overall, 22% have a BMI greater than 30, so more people are showing up in the emergency department who are obese, author Dr. Jennifer Lighter told PolitiFact. A spokeswoman for DeSantis cited a news article in USA Today about a study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which examined characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in 14 states in March. The CDC found that among 178 adult patients with data on underlying conditions as of March 30, the vast majority had one or more underlying conditions. The most common underlying conditions in order were hypertension closely followed by obesity. (The other conditions that followed were chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.) A DeSantis spokeswoman also pointed to an article by Reuters about New Orleans’ death rate from COVID-19. Reuters reported that obesity was seen in 25% of the COVID-19 deaths in Louisiana, according to the state health department.  A paper about obesity in COVID-19 cases at a hospital in Shenzhen, China found that patients with obesity are at increased risk of complications from viral respiratory infections however, the association with severity of COVID- 19 was unclear. Researchers found that obesity, especially in men, significantly increases the risk of developing severe pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.  The study examined 383 patients admitted in January and February. We sent the NYU research findings to a few doctors who were not involved in the studies to ask if research so far shows obesity is the No. 1 factor in COVID-19 critical cases or hospitalization cases.  ""Not exactly,"" said Dr. Angela Fitch, associate director MassGeneral Weight Center. ""This data shows that in people less than 60 years old, having the disease of obesity increased the need for admission to the hospital and admission to the ICU. Age is still the No. 1 factor so far but in those patients who are younger, obesity is a risk factor for more severe disease."" The early data across many countries show a link between severity of disease and obesity, said Fitch, vice president of the Obesity Medicine Association. However, further research is needed nationwide and across the world, she said.  DeSantis said ""obesity is, like, the No. 1 factor in whether you really get hit hard by COVID-19."" DeSantis didn’t explain what he meant by ""hit hard,"" so we looked at research about COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized. We did not find any study that showed that obesity is the No. 1 risk factor. Most research and evidence so far shows age as the top factor. But early research suggests that obesity is also a key risk factor.  We rate this statement Half True.",/factchecks/2020/apr/17/ron-desantis/obesity-top-risk-factor-covid-19-hospitalizations/

Trump claim that Madison, Milwaukee are sanctuary cities has some merit but goes too far
","It’s not often that a claim hits the Truth-O-Meter more than two months after it was made.  But, it’s not often that the President of the United States comes to town, makes a claim before a packed rally about undocumented immigrants in Madison and Milwaukee who -- he says -- were set free after abusing children, then provides so little backup that even local officials had trouble tracking down just what he was talking about.  Here is what Trump said at the Jan. 14, 2020 rally in Milwaukee: ""In the city of Madison, police arrested an illegal alien for assault and after authorities released him, he committed violent battery, only to be released one more time. They are now looking for him. Isn't that nice? The same illegal alien was arrested for a third time in September and charged with multiple sexual assaults, including sexual assault of a child. Now that criminal is once again in Wisconsin jail."" Then: ""Last year, the sanctuary county of Milwaukee released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of a child. Think about that, of children. He is now at large and they are searching all over. He is looking for another victim. He is allowed to go from your sanctuary city.""  To break it down, Trump essentially claims Madison and Milwaukee County both carry sanctuary status for illegal immigrants and have released undocumented immigrants who have committed multiple crimes including sexual assault of a child.  We dug into both cases and the underlying question:  Do Madison and Milwaukee County carry ""sanctuary status,"" which means they don’t comply with federal actions to track down undocumented immigrants?  In regard to the Madison case, Trump’s campaign referred us to the case of Luis Ruiz-Ugalde. When we searched Ruiz-Ugalde’s name on the state court system’s public court records database, we found three cases linked to his name in Madison.  The first, filed in 2014, involved damage to property, resisting and obstructing an officer and disorderly conduct.  The second, filed in June of 2019, revolved around two counts of disorderly conduct and one count of battery.  The third case, filed September of 2019, lists a range of counts, including one for battery, one for attempted sexual assault, and one for sexual assault of a child. A Sept. 27, 2019 news report from WMTV in Madison said Ruiz-Ugalde, 26 at the time, was charged with four felonies and three misdemeanors after Madison police alleged he attacked several women and a 13-year-old girl over five days. According to Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne, Ruiz-Ugalde is currently being held in the Dane County Jail on a $100,000 cash bail. Jury selection is currently set for June 1 and jury trial dates June 2 through the 4th.  The WMTV news report said: ""The Dane County Sheriff’s Office (said) Immigration and Customs Enforcement asked for a hold on Ruiz-Ugalde when he was booked for battery, which the sheriff’s office did not comply with."" So, the details of this case essentially match Trump’s claim.  Trump’s team never provided any information about the Milwaukee claim, which we requested multiple times. So we turned to local authorities to see if we could find a match. Sheronda Grant, spokeswoman for the Milwaukee Police Department, said Trump’s statement alone does not have enough information to determine what he might be referring to.  The Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Department offered a similar explanation.  ""The Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office does not hold individuals solely on ICE detainers following the satisfaction of criminal process,"" Faithe Colas, director of public affairs for the sheriff’s department, wrote in an e-mail. ""The Sheriff’s Office has no ability to verify the assertions made in the referenced speech."" Nevertheless, we sent out a public records request to the Sheriff’s Office seeking the names of individuals released from jail since January 2019, including those released on bail or after completing a sentence. Additionally, we asked for a list of the charges on which each of those people were held The sheriff’s office has not yet completed our request.  So, it is impossible to say if Trump is right on this one, but our view is the burden is on the speaker to establish his or her claim. Of course, a key part of the claim is that Milwaukee County and Madison have adopted ""sanctuary"" status. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington D.C.-based think tank that advocates for lower immigration levels, neither the city of Milwaukee or Milwaukee County are considered to have ""sanctuary"" status. Sanctuary cities are a name given to municipalities that may shelter undocumented immigrants. They can be controversial and are largely decided by municipal leadership if they do not want to comply with federal law enforcement in targeting those residing illegally within the community.  For example, San Francisco and Chicago both explicitly state they are sanctuary cities from the mayor’s office.  That said, the name ""sanctuary city"" is a political term and not a legal one. Even if cities don’t declare themselves as such, they may still act in this matter.  In 2017, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said though the city isn’t a sanctuary city, immigrants won’t be harassed within the city limits.  In 2012, Milwaukee County passed a resolution that would allow Milwaukee sheriff deputies to decline Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention requests unless they involve people with criminal records, a warrant, they are a known gang member or they are on the United States terrorist watch list. We also found Milwaukee Public Schools designated all of its educational sites as a safe haven for undocumented students and families. Essentially, that means the school district assures students and families that any possible actions taken by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on school grounds will be opposed by all legal means possible. So, though Milwaukee County isn’t formally under ""sanctuary status,"" it still functions in a similar manner.  Meanwhile, in 2010, the Madison Common Council passed a resolution instructing police not to inform federal immigration officers about undocumented immigrants unless they’re charged with violent crimes.  Former Mayor Paul Soglin said the city is not a ""sanctuary city,"" but some state Republican lawmakers say current Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway has instituted sanctuary policies within Madison.  In response to Trump’s immigration stances, Rhodes-Conway has previously said she will stand by the immigrant community and inform the community of any increased ICE activity. Trump deemed Milwaukee and Madison sanctuary cities at a January rally in Milwaukee. Along with that, he mentioned incidents of undocumented immigrants committing crimes in these two cities to back up his claim.  We only found evidence for one of the incidents he discussed in Madison, but found no evidence for anything similar in Milwaukee.  Though Milwaukee and Madison officials don’t identify their cities as being ""sanctuary,"" they do practice immigration protection in a way that may fit that meaning.  We rate this claim Half True.

Donald Trump falsely claims Nancy Pelosi deleted video telling people to go to Chinatown
","President Donald Trump joined conservative supporters in accusing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of covering up her visit to San Francisco’s Chinatown in late February. ""Crazy Nancy Pelosi deleted this from her Twitter account. She wanted everyone to pack into Chinatown long after I closed the BORDER TO CHINA. Based on her statement, she is responsible for many deaths. She’s an incompetent, third-rate politician!"" Trump tweeted April 16. Crazy Nancy Pelosi deleted this from her Twitter account. She wanted everyone to pack into Chinatown long after I closed the BORDER TO CHINA. Based on her statement, she is responsible for many deaths. She’s an incompetent, third-rate politician! pic.twitter.com/uWNI7DCG3o But there’s no evidence Pelosi ever tweeted that video of herself in Chinatown. So she could not have deleted it, as Trump said. The video Trump tweeted is 17 seconds long, a snippet of a Feb. 24 report by KPIX, a San Francisco Bay Area CBS affiliate. Pelosi in the KPIX report is shown walking through San Francisco’s Chinatown District and encouraging people to visit its shops and restaurants, which were seeing a decline in business since the coronavirus outbreak began in China. At the time, KPIX reported, there were no active cases of coronavirus in San Francisco. There were 21 active cases in California, but they were in hospital isolation or in quarantine. Pelosi says in the video: ""You should come to Chinatown. Precautions have been taken by our city. We know that there is concern about tourism, traveling throughout the world, but we think it’s very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come."" We wondered if Trump was right that Pelosi deleted that video from her Twitter account. PolitiFact’s fact-checking process includes asking a person who makes a claim for the evidence that supports their statement. So we asked the White House press office and Trump’s re-election campaign for the date of the original post, which account posted it, and when it was deleted. We did not get any information. Pelosi’s office told PolitiFact that they never posted the video that Trump claimed was deleted. We did our own digging and found no trace of the video posted from her account. Politwoops, a project of ProPublica, tracks deleted tweets by elected officials. According to that tracker, @SpeakerPelosi’s latest five deleted tweets span from Feb. 22 to April 13. Not one is about going to Chinatown. We also reviewed what Pelosi’s Twitter page looked liked since Feb. 24, based on the history saved by Wayback Machine, an initiative of the Internet Archive. The archived pages of Pelosi’s Twitter account do not show the video Trump tweeted. (Wayback Machine did not have archives of the page as they looked on Feb. 24-26, but any deletion of that video would presumably be more recent.) Trump suggests that Pelosi is hiding her actions from Feb. 24. But a transcript of her comments that were captured in Trump’s video appear on both her House Speaker website and congressional website. As of April 16, the Chinatown visit was one of the featured photos in the homepage of her congressional website. Pelosi’s Twitter page currently has a video of her Feb. 24 visit to Chinatown. It shows her making a fortune cookie. Text accompanying the video says: ""It was a pleasure to try my hand at making fortune cookies at the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory (with a little guidance from owner Kevin Chan, of course). The message inside? ‘United We Stand.’"" On Feb. 25, she posted a series of tweets saying Americans needed a coordinated response to the coronavirus and that the House would advance a funding package ""that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis."" It’s worth noting that throughout January and most of February, U.S. officials said that the coronavirus risk to the American public was low and that they were not seeing community spread of the virus. By Feb. 25, there were 53 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States and no deaths, according to data compiled by the World Health Organization. On Feb. 28, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doctor said it was possible that a reported case in California ""could be the first instance of community spread — meaning the illness was acquired through an unknown exposure in the community."" But it could also be that the patient was exposed through contact to a traveler who was infected, said Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The immediate risk to the general American public remained low, she said. The cancelling of mass gatherings was not yet common in the United States in February, the CDC noted in an April report. RELATED: Louisiana governor is right, there was no suggestion Mardi Gras had to be canceled Trump’s messaging around this time also did not suggest that people avoid large crowds. The same day of Pelosi’s trip to Chinatown, Trump tweeted: ""The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!"" Trump tweeted that Pelosi deleted a video of her telling people to go to Chinatown. Pelosi on Feb. 24 did encourage people to go to Chinatown in San Francisco. But we found no trace of her posting or deleting the video Trump shared. At the time of Pelosi’s remark, U.S. health officials said the risk of the coronavirus was low to the American public since they had no reports of community spread. Trump during this time also said the virus was under control in the United States. Neither the White House nor Trump’s re-election campaign provide evidence to support Trump’s claim.

One report cited a case in which a police officer accompanied a landlord on an eviction of an African. Black residents in a part of Guangzhou known as ""Little Africa"" are being forced to remain inside their apartments — even if they have not traveled anywhere that would warrant a quarantine — and submit to coronavirus tests, the Washington Post reported.

Obama knocks GOP’s stance on preexisting conditions during pandemic
","Endorsing his former vice president, Joe Biden, to win the White House, former President Barack Obama sought to contrast the 2020 platforms of Democrats and Republicans on a critical plank: their stance on the Affordable Care Act. It’s a difference, he argued, that has assumed newfound urgency. ""The Republicans occupying the White House and running the Senate … have shown themselves willing to cut millions off their health insurance and eliminate preexisting condition protections for millions more, even in the middle of this public health crisis,"" Obama said. Obama was referring to a couple of GOP policies, the former president’s senior adviser Eric Schultz told KHN. The first: a pending Supreme Court case, Texas v. Azar, in which the Trump administration has argued the 2010 health law should be struck down. Schultz also highlighted the White House’s refusal to provide a special open enrollment period for the ACA health exchanges in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. We’ve previously checked claims about President Donald Trump’s stance on the law’s preexisting condition protections — arguably its most popular component ― and his position on the Texas v. Azar lawsuit. But COVID-19 adds new relevance, because of both the virus’s devastating health implications and bludgeoning impact on the American economy. Indeed, the Trump administration’s handling of the virus crisis is shaping up to be a defining issue in the run-up to November. Meanwhile, Biden made the health care law a signature component of his presidential platform and has been a vocal critic of the administration’s pandemic response. With that in mind, we decided to take another look. Obama is correct: The Republican Party has opposed the ACA for years. In 2016, then-candidate Trump campaigned on its repeal. Since then, the White House and congressional Republicans have pursued an agenda that would dismantle the law’s preexisting condition protections. Republicans haven’t united behind an alternative plan, either. First: the lawsuit. Texas v. Azar stems from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That measure took the teeth out of the health law’s individual mandate, which required that all Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty. The tax law, pushed by Republicans and signed by Trump, set that penalty to $0. A collection of Republican states’ attorneys general now argue that, without the penalty, the rest of the health law doesn’t work and should be struck down. Killing the ACA would eliminate the stipulation that insurance plans cannot charge people more if they have a preexisting condition, get rid of the subsidies it provides for people to buy insurance on the exchanges and gut the Medicaid expansion that, in six years, directly extended coverage to more than 13 million people. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case, although it won’t rule until after the November election. The Trump administration, while technically in the position that would defend the law in court, has declined to support it — a move legal experts say is almost unprecedented. In fact, the administration has even sided with the states arguing that it should be struck down. Neither the White House nor Senate Republicans have put forth a replacement bill that would maintain the ACA’s protections in the event the high court rules against the law. We asked the White House if the administration had changed its stance in the wake of the pandemic. Trump’s staff redirected us to the Justice Department, the federal government’s legal arm. The department did not respond to emailed requests for comment. As recently as the end of March, though, Trump told reporters he still wanted the law ""terminated."" Senate Democrats have pushed the administration to change its position on the lawsuit. But Republicans, who hold the Senate majority, have been silent, a position that hasn’t changed even since COVID-19 effectively shut down large swaths of the country. In some ways, the Republican stance isn’t important, argued Thomas Miller, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a public policy think tank. It’s hard to imagine the Supreme Court voting to get rid of the health law, especially in the midst of COVID-19, he said. Still, that doesn’t change the facts of what Trump is arguing. And the lawsuit is also only one part of the equation. Another, is healthcare.gov. Americans who have lost their jobs ― and, often, the insurance that came with it — are eligible to buy insurance on the federal exchange, since job loss is a ""qualifying life event"" that gets you special access. Those who otherwise lack coverage would normally have to wait until the regular open enrollment period, which takes place at the end of the year. But the threat of COVID-19 has changed the risk for many of these potential shoppers. In response, 11 states have independently reopened their state-run health exchanges for a special sign-up period. But the administration has declined to take such steps for the national marketplace. ""If you have been uninsured and picked up your newspaper, or turned on your news and realized your health was in much greater risk than you had anticipated, and would like to rush and get health insurance in case you end up on a ventilator ― you’re out of luck,"" said Linda Blumberg, a health policy fellow at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization. Even before coronavirus, the institute estimated that 32 million Americans were uninsured. About 20 million of them could benefit from a special enrollment period, Blumberg said. Without insurance, coronavirus treatment poses not just a health risk, but also a financial one. The Trump administration has said it will pay hospitals directly, out of a pool of $100 billion, to cover the cost of treating uninsured people with COVD-19. After treating patients, hospitals would get paid at the Medicare rate. But the administration’s policy extends only to covering COVID-19 treatment. Uninsured people with underlying chronic conditions don’t have a way to pay for health care, noted Robert Berenson, another Urban Institute fellow. If left untreated, those chronic ailments make COVID-19 far more dangerous than it would be for someone able to get preventive treatment earlier on. President Trump’s stance raises another question, experts noted. Without the ACA, what kind of impact would COVID-19 have? Even with the heath law intact, many Americans won’t be able to find affordable health insurance. That particularly applies to people who can’t afford the premiums on the individual marketplace, don’t qualify for federal subsidies or live in one of the 14 states that didn’t opt into the ACA’s Medicaid expansion provision. And the ACA is nowhere near sufficient on its own, Miller noted. Having insurance is part of the picture, but it doesn’t guarantee access to testing or that a hospital will be able to treat you. ""On the margins, it does help a little bit to have insurance coverage, but the problem is so much larger than that,"" Miller argued. Still, without the health law, the virus’s impact would be ""catastrophic,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Striking the individual marketplace and Medicaid expansion would leave almost another 20 million people uninsured — ""at risk for not only illness from COVID-19, but also massive medical bills,"" said Larry Levitt, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) Without the ACA, COVID-19 could be considered a preexisting condition. Insurance companies could charge more to cover people who have previously contracted the virus (assuming, of course, those people can get tested and recorded as having had COVID-19). Plus, emerging evidence suggests severe cases of COVID-19 may leave lingering health consequences, that even after recovery would require ongoing medical care, Levitt said. ""The ACA’s consumer protections ensure that persons with COVID-19 can obtain insurance without fear of being turned away or charged exorbitant premiums because of their preexisting condition,"" Oberlander said. The health law also imposed strict regulations over what insurance must cover. Without those regulations, plans could ― and likely would — revert to skimpier coverage, Blumberg said. That, she said, means plans that perhaps don’t cover ventilators or branded medicines, or that cap how many days of hospital care they’ll cover, or that require people to pay much more out-of-pocket. ""Insurers, given the legal ability to do it, would limit their legal liability and protect themselves from high claims,"" she said. ""They did it before and will do it again."" Obama accused the Trump administration and Senate Republicans of being ""willing to cut millions off their health insurance and eliminate preexisting condition protections for millions more, even in the middle of this public health crisis."" Evidence indicates that this is an apt characterization. None have put forth a plan that would maintain coverage or consumer protections ― policies that benefit millions of Americans — if the Supreme Court rules against the ACA. And as Obama asserts, striking down the law without an equivalent replacement could be devastating, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The government released the virus among the population and has lost control of the outbreak.""  The spread of misinformation about the coronavirus on TikTok and through Amazon Alexa have recently been reported by outlets such as WUSA9’s VERIFY team and Vox. Let’s take a closer look. There was an Event 201, involving a simulated viral pandemic. And it did take place on Oct. 18, 2019, at a hotel in New York. But no actual virus was created or released. During the event, officials from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and 15 global business, government and public health leaders held a 3.5 hour simulation to view the potential effects of an infectious pandemic. The exercise consisted of pre-recorded news broadcasts, live ""staff"" briefings, and moderated discussions on specific topics, the organizers said.  The purpose of the simulation was to examine how industries, governments and public health leaders might have to join forces to combat a global health crisis. It was inspired by research published by the World Economic Forum, an international foundation that studies the intersection of business, politics and academics and their impacts on policy. The pandemic in the fictionalized scenario was caused by a coronavirus, of which there are many types.  The study found that a pandemic could cause an average annual economic loss of 0.7% of global gross domestic product, or about $570 billion. The businesses and political leaders involved in the simulation were tasked with working together to create viable solutions to the theoretical pandemic.  The participants’ conclusion was that ""the next severe pandemic will not only cause great illness and loss of life but could also trigger major cascading economic and societal consequences that could contribute greatly to global impact and suffering."" Now that the world is grappling with an actual coronavirus pandemic, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security has released a statement reaffirming that the simulation did not predict the current outbreak, but rather was an exercise to examine what would need to happen if one did occur.  ""For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction,"" the center said. ""Instead, the exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that would likely arise in a very severe pandemic."" Why did the question posed to Alexa bring up Event 201?  That only happens in the TikTok video. We asked Alexa directly, and it brought up a different response. Alexa said, ""According to the World Health Organization, the exact cause of the current outbreak of COVID-19 is still under investigation. On December 31, 2019, it was reported to the WHO country office in China that a new coronavirus strain later, named COVID-19, was identified by Chinese researchers in connection with a pneumonia-like illness based in Wuhan city, China.""  A spokesperson at Amazon told PolitiFact that the one appearing in the video ""is not Alexa's response to customers, and we have not been able to replicate this example.""  The company said that any news Alexa is providing to customers about COVID-19 is from official government sources. The company suggested a couple of explanations why Alexa might have responded the way it did in the video.  One possibility is that a customer set a specific response for Alexa. Responses can be recorded and scheduled, like a daily reminder service. This response would play only on that customer’s device, not the system at large.  Another possibility involves Alexa Skill Blueprints, which offer templates for trivia games, birthday cards, and flashcards. With this feature, users can create their own automated questions and responses.  Facebook posts say that if you ask Amazon’s Alexa about the origin of the coronavirus pandemic, it says ""the government planned"" it and refers to something called ""Event 201."" There was a project called Event 201 that simulated possible outcomes of a coronavirus pandemic, but it was a planning exercise and did not predict this specific COVID-19 pandemic.  More importantly, we were unable to elicit the same answer from Alexa, and Amazon told us that the answer to that question would be different. We rate the statement False. ",/factchecks/2020/apr/16/facebook-posts/no-amazons-alexa-doesnt-say-government-planned-cor/

Trump’s Vegas hotel hasn’t made donations, but it isn’t the only one
","Amid the pain of the coronavirus pandemic, one of the luxury hotels that bears President Donald Trump’s name was attacked as lacking compassion. ""All Las Vegas hotels have donated food and rooms for emergency personnel except for one: Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,"" a Facebook post claimed. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Unlike some other hotel groups operating in Las Vegas, Trump’s hotel did not donate rooms, food or supplies, according to reporting by us and other media.  But there’s no reason to believe Trump’s hotel was the only exception. Las Vegas is the nation’s largest hotel market, with roughly 150,000 rooms and thousands more under construction, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority lists 277 lodging establishments in the city as of December 2019, not including time-shares.  The American Hotel & Lodging Association says more than 16,000 U.S. hotels have signed up to participate in its initiative to link hotels offering rooms with first responders and health care workers seeking lodging. As of April 6, three days before the Facebook post, 36 Las Vegas hotels were participating, the association told the Review-Journal.  The association didn’t respond to our requests for details. Neither did the Las Vegas Hospitality Association, which counts 260 companies among its members. The 64-story, 1,282-room Trump International Hotel Las Vegas opened just off on The Strip in 2008. It’s one of eight hotels and resorts that the Trump Organization owns in North America.  Trump still owns the company. But after becoming president, he gave up his position as an officer and day-to-day control, and the company’s assets were put into a trust that is managed by his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered a statewide shutdown of hotels, casinos and other non-essential businesses on March 17.  Since then, several hotel groups operating in Las Vegas have announced donations of hotel rooms, food and supplies for workers dealing with the health crisis.  Polo Towers, Cancun Resort and Desert Paradise Resort are among Diamond Resorts properties offering complimentary accommodations to medical personnel and first responders, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Wynn Resorts told the newspaper it is offering financial aid, food and personal protective equipment to local medical facilities and nonprofits in Las Vegas. Nationally, Marriott announced it has committed to provide $10 million worth of free hotel stays for health care professionals in cities hard hit by COVID-19, including Las Vegas. The Trump Organization did not reply to our requests for information for this fact check. Trump has saluted hotels and other businesses for their role in helping Americans cope with the coronavirus crisis. But media reports say that his own company hasn’t played much of a role.  ProPublica reported April 2 that in its review of Trump Organization properties, it ""couldn’t find any sign they were joining the effort to fight the coronavirus, even as the president urges other companies to do so."" The article said many Las Vegas hotels and casinos that closed because of the governor’s order — including MGM, Wynn, Boyd Gaming, Station Casinos and Caesars — ""provided huge quantities of unused food"" and cash to a local food bank. The food bank director said nothing had been donated by the Trump hotel. Politico reported April 9 that local and state officials around the country were asking hotels to volunteer to house patients or first responders. In the seven U.S. cities with Trump luxury hotels, including Las Vegas, no local officials said the Trump properties were in discussions to house overflow patients or medical personnel. In response to the pandemic, the Trump Organization laid off or furloughed about 1,500 employees at Trump hotels in the United States and Canada, including in Las Vegas, the Washington Post reported on April 3. The company employs about 4,000 people. Las Vegas-based Caesars Entertainment Corp. said April 2 it expects to furlough about 90% of its employees. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt are among hotel owners furloughing tens of thousands of workers or slashing staff. A Facebook post attacks Trump’s Las Vegas hotel as being the only one in the city that didn’t offer food or rooms for emergency personnel. The Trump Organization hasn’t provided any information, and searches by PolitiFact and other news organizations didn’t turn up any evidence that Trump’s properties have made such donations. Several other hotels in Las Vegas have made donations, but the Trump hotel does not appear to be the only exception. The city has hundreds of hotels, motels and inns, and a hotel industry trade group says 36 Las Vegas hotels were participating in its national initiative to offer rooms to first responders and health care workers.  For a statement that contains an element of truth, but leaves a misleading impression, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/apr/16/facebook-posts/trumps-vegas-hotel-hasnt-made-donations-it-isnt-on/

Yes, millions in U.S. have lost job-related health insurance while those in other nations have not
","Millions of Americans have lost their jobs as the nation shuts down to slow the spread of COVID-19.  For those who get their health insurance from an employer, losing a job means losing health benefits, too.  Employer-based health insurance is the most common coverage in the U.S., covering more than half of Americans for all or part of the calendar year in 2018, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.  But how many of those people lost that insurance as a byproduct of the pandemic?  The group Public Citizen, a progressive think tank that advocates for universal health care, tweeted April 4, 2020 that 3.5 million Americans lost employer-tied health insurance in March.  In the tweet, the U.S. total stood in stark contrast at the bottom of a list of 20 other nations — beginning with Australia, Belgium and Canada, and ending with Sweden, Turkey and the U.K. — that, combined, tallied for zero people losing health insurance.  Is the claim accurate? That number of suddenly uninsured people comes from a report by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute that was released on April 2, 2020.  In the report, economists estimated 3.5 million American workers ""were at high risk"" of losing their employer-provided health care in the previous two weeks, by comparing unemployment insurance claims per industry (to represent the number of jobs lost) with the employer-provided health insurance coverage rate in that industry.  One difference between the report and the tweet: the economists only examined unemployment claims from the last two weeks in March, while the tweet suggests the entire month of March.  But the last two weeks in March, during which joblessness soared to nearly 10 million Americans filing for unemployment benefits, is when the problem truly began to take hold.  So, the real total is likely somewhat higher, if you include those who filed for unemployment during the first two weeks of the month.  While millions in the 20 listed countries have also lost their jobs, the tweet put the number who lost employer-provided health coverage at zero. How can that be? For most countries, it’s an easy answer: Being employed and having health insurance are not tied together nearly as often, because the countries have universal health care.  Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom all have a universal health care system, according to a 2011 listing from New York’s Department of Health.  That leaves us with Chile, Hungary and Turkey.  Statistics from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development show that in 2018, more than three quarters of Chile’s population was covered by government/social health insurance, and in Turkey and Hungary, nearly 100% of the population was covered.  In Chile, those who do not have private insurance are automatically enrolled in government-provided health insurance. So, in effect those countries also have universal coverage. Public Citizen’s tweet showed the discrepancy between countries with universal health care and the U.S., in terms of jobs lost due to the coronavirus.  According to the Economic Policy Institute, the 3.5 million number is accurate, though it’s estimate examined the last two weeks of March and economists labeled the total ""likely,"" not certain.  Meanwhile, the other countries listed each utilize a universal or government-provided health insurance model, meaning citizens there are not at risk of losing their health insurance if they lose their job. We rate this claim Mostly True.

U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey says the coronavirus outbreak has reached a peak. That's half true
","U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey wants the president to reopen the economy, and in an interview with Politico, he said he sees clear signs that the country is ready – even as top public health officials studying the coronavirus warn against moving too quickly. ""In a matter of days, and in some cases the moment may even have passed, that we’ve reached the peak of the rate of infections,"" said Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania. We wondered whether the number of new cases reported each day has subsided and whether case counts are likely to stay down if the economy roars back to life like Toomey wants. Toomey is right that the coronavirus crisis in the U.S. has begun to stabilize. On Monday, states reported at least 1,500 new fatalities, a figure below last week’s running tally of roughly 2,000 deaths every 24 hours. And the number of new cases reported Monday – about 23,000 – was also well below last week’s trend of 30,000 to 50,000 new cases each day. These signs led a coalition of mostly Democratic governors on the east and west coasts to announce plans to coordinate the reopening of their economies. But even as they announced their pacts, the governors offered no timeline for ending the lockdowns that have kept the vast majority of more than 100 million residents of their states stuck at home. Toomey relied on a statement made last week by Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine when he made his claim about reaching the outbreak’s peak, said Steve Kelly, a spokesman for the senator. Levine said she believes Pennsylvania has enough hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators to meet demand but that ""we’re watching that data very closely."" Data compiled by her department shows that 41 percent of hospital beds, 39 percent of ICU beds and nearly 70 percent of ventilators across the state are still available, meaning Pennsylvania’s health care system is not at risk of being overrun. This is what makes the senator believe it’s time to reopen the economy in ""a gradual and safe way,"" Kelly said. Models created by a University of Washington global health research center indicate it’s been five days since the use of hospital resources peaked nationwide. But these models don’t account for the sort of relaxation of social distancing rules that Toomey and other Republicans are pushing for. Hospital capacity will be tested again once social distancing ends, and a new Washington Post analysis shows that in many parts of the country, including large swathes of Pennsylvania, it won’t hold up. A team of Post reporters analyzed the availability of critical care resources across the country using data sets assembled by Definitive Healthcare, an analytics company that mines government filings, including those of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well as commercial insurance claims. Imagining a scenario where the coronavirus infects two in 10 adults over the next year, the reporters found a patchwork of possible preparedness shortcomings in cities and towns where the full force of the virus has yet to hit and where people may not be following isolation and social distancing orders. The Post determined that more than half of the nation’s population lives in areas that are less prepared for the virus than New York City, where in early April officials scrambled to add more ICU beds and find extra ventilators amid a surge or coronavirus patients. Parts of Pennsylvania that border Maryland and Ohio would fall especially short, the Post found. Making the case to reopen the nation’s economy, Toomey said, ""In a matter of days, and in some cases the moment may even have passed, that we’ve reached the peak of the rate of infections."" Data on coronavirus case counts and fatalities show that the country’s outbreak is subsiding. But Toomey’s comments don’t account for what will happen once social distancing ends. A new Washington Post analysis shows that hospitals in many parts of the country will be overrun, including large swathes of Pennsylvania, if two in 10 adults contract the virus over the next year. Toomey’s comments to Politico are partially accurate but leave out important details. We rate this statement Half True. ",/factchecks/2020/apr/16/pat-toomey/us-sen-pat-toomey-says-coronavirus-outbreak-has-re/

Facebook posts falsely claim Dr. Fauci has millions invested in a coronavirus vaccine
","The country’s top infectious disease expert is discouraging the use of a potential COVID-19 treatment because he could earn millions of dollars from a vaccine, at least, that’s according to a popular Facebook claim. One post published by an anti-vaccine page on April 12 says Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), ""stands to lose 100 million dollars"" on a coronavirus vaccine from Bill Gates because he invested in it. ""If everyone can be healed with the Malaria drug and a Z pack, there will be no need for the vaccine if we could use drugs already on the market that helps heal 98 percent of the cornovirus (sic) patients,"" reads the image. ""That’s why he’s been so hesitant to put his seal of approval on this form of treatment that has shown to drastically improve hundreds of people’s symptoms."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) As a member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, Fauci has tempered expectations for the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients. The drugs, which are used to treat conditions like malaria and lupus, respectively, have shown some promise in alleviating coronavirus symptoms, but the research is not conclusive. PolitiFact has seen a lot of misinformation about public officials’ financial interests in hydroxychloroquine. Fauci has become a popular target for coronavirus disinformation, so we wanted to check out this post, too. The Facebook post draws a false connection between Gates’ philanthropy and Fauci’s public remarks about hydroxychloroquine. There is no evidence that Fauci is personally financially invested in a coronavirus vaccine, and scientists still don’t know if hydroxychloroquine is effective in treating COVID-19. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is indirectly supporting the NIAID by funding a group that is helping the agency develop a potential coronavirus vaccine. But there is no evidence that Fauci himself stands to profit. The Gates Foundation said in a Feb. 5 statement that it is investing up to $100 million for ""the global response to the 2019 novel coronavirus."" That includes efforts aimed at improving detection and treatment of the virus in addition to vaccine development. ""The foundation will commit up to $60 million to accelerate the discovery, development and testing of vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for 2019-nCoV (the formal name for the coronavirus),"" the statement reads.  While the Gates Foundation has supported the NIAID in the past, the philanthropy told PolitiFact in an email that it does not provide funding to the agency now, even though NIAID is currently developing a COVID-19 vaccine. During his March 11 testimony to the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Fauci said it could take a year and a half to roll out a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine. There are 70 vaccines in development, according to the World Health Organization — three of which are in clinical trials. The first trial began in mid-March. The potential vaccine was developed by NIAID scientists in partnership with pharmaceutical company Moderna, Inc. A search of the Securities Exchange Commission’s database, which contains information on publicly traded companies, turned up no documents linking Fauci directly to Moderna. According to a statement from the National Institutes of Health, which houses the NIAID, manufacturing for the potential vaccine was supported by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a foundation that funds vaccine research. The Gates Foundation said in its February release that it will allocate some of its research and development funding to the coalition.  So Gates' money is indirectly going toward the development of a potential coronavirus vaccine created by NIAID scientists, but not to the agency itself. And there is no publicly available evidence that Fauci personally stands to profit from a vaccine. The Facebook post claims that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine heal ""98% of coronavirus patients"" and have improved ""hundreds of people’s symptoms."" There is no evidence to back that up. With more than 50 studies in the works, there is still much scientists don’t know about how hydroxychloroquine affects the coronavirus. But four studies — two from France and two from China — have come to conflicting conclusions. One study of 62 patients in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the pandemic, found that those who were issued hydroxychloroquine saw their body temperature and cough go down faster than the control group. But a separate group of doctors in Shanghai found that the drug had no discernible effect on a group of 30 patients over the course of a week. RELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know Two studies in France had similarly opposing conclusions. One hospital in Marseilles gave 80 COVID-19 patients a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, an antibiotic. After five days, 95% of the patients tested negative for the coronavirus. But a similar hospital study in Paris found no marked improvement in 10 patients. Bottom line: We still don’t know whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is effective at improving COVID-19 symptoms.  That uncertainty, as well as the drugs’ adverse heart effects and the potential for doctors to stockpile it, is why public health officials have urged caution. There are no Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs to treat COVID-19, although the agency has issued an emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in hospitals. A Facebook post claims Fauci has downplayed the potential use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus patients because he stands to lose $100 million on a Gates-funded vaccine. There are 70 potential COVID-19 vaccines in development, one of which was created by NIAID scientists in partnership with Moderna, Inc. That vaccine is being manufactured by an organization that the Gates Foundation supports, but there’s no evidence that NIAID or Fauci will directly profit from that support. And the Gates Foundation has pledged up to $60 million for vaccine development, not $100 million, as the post says. Some studies have found that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could help treat coronavirus patients, but others have found no effect at all. Public health officials have urged caution due to the uncertainty and the adverse side effects of the drugs. The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2020/apr/15/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-falsely-claim-dr-fauci-has-millions/
