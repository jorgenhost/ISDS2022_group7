Contemporaneous news reports said that a heat wave in California exacerbated the fire’s spread. McGlover pleaded guilty to arson charges for the Cranston Fire in 2019 and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Fire officials and experts believe that the West Coast’s 2020 wildfire season has been mostly fueled by a combination of severe drought, historic heat, lightning storms and heavy winds.  RELATED: Climate change created conditions for the West Coast fires, experts say  There are a couple of exceptions. A man was arrested on charges of arson and cultivating marijuana in connection with California’s Dolan Fire, and officials said San Bernardino County’s El Dorado Fire was caused by a device at a gender reveal party.

The center is used as an entertainment venue that can host up to 17,000 people at a time and the home arena for the New Jersey Devils hockey and Seton Hall basketball teams.

He also said the state would still offer voters the option to cast their ballots in person.  In-person polling locations before Election Day will be available for only the visually impaired, according to the Essex County Board of Elections. But Murphy’s executive order directs counties to provide at least half their usual polling sites on Election Day so voters can cast their ballots in person, by provisional ballot, if they want.  Counties are supposed to choose polling locations based on geography and population density. In Essex County alone, dozens of polling locations are typically offered.  However, the order does allow counties to concentrate more voting districts into one larger polling place. The city said the Prudential Center ""will be able to fit more voting districts in this one site."" Decisions on final polling sites are made by the individual counties, not the governor. So what exactly is a ""super polling site""?  At the Prudential Center in Newark, voters will be allowed to cast their provisional ballots on the first floor from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day, according to the city. The center will also be a place that accepts mail-in ballots, registers voters, and holds a satellite office for early vote counts by the county. (A lawsuit by President Donald Trump’s campaign is currently trying to stop early vote canvassing.) The Prudential Center won’t be the only place to drop off ballots, either. The governor’s order requires counties to provide at least 10 easily accessible drop boxes, where voters can return their ballots ahead of Nov. 3. Ballots must be postmarked by 8 p.m. on Election Day and received by election boards up to a week later to get counted. New Jersey this year joined several other states that conduct all vote-by-mail elections as a way to combat the challenges around voting during a pandemic. Some Western states — Washington, Oregon and Colorado — have done this for years. This November, nine states and DC will send all registered voters mail-in ballots. The Facebook post claimed that Murphy is ""only allowing in-person voting on Election Day at Prudential Center in Newark, N.J., ""calling it a #SuperPollingStation."" The Prudential Center is being offered as a ""super polling site"" on Election Day, when voters who don’t want to cast their ballots by mail can show up and vote in person with a provisional ballot.  But it won’t be the only in-person polling site available.

Sen. Lindsey Graham flip-flops on filling a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year
","President Donald Trump is moving quickly to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Trump can count on Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to move the nomination process along.  ""I will support President Donald Trump in any effort to move forward regarding the recent vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg,"" Graham tweeted Sept. 19, the day after Ginsburg’s death. In light of these two events, I will support President @realDonaldTrump in any effort to move forward regarding the recent vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg. #3 Graham said he was doing this because Senate Democrats had aimed to derail the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who prevailed on a 50-48 vote.  ""Chuck Schumer and his friends in the liberal media conspired to destroy the life of Brett Kavanaugh and hold that Supreme Court seat open,"" Graham wrote.  He also faulted former Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., as the first to allow a simple majority — as opposed to a 60 vote supermajority — for circuit court appointments. Reid’s 2013 decision eliminated the need to win at least some support from the minority party. In Senate circles, this is called the nuclear option, because it eliminates the power of the filibuster. Republicans deployed the nuclear option in 2017 to block a Democratic filibuster and secure Neil Gorsuch’s rise to the high court. As a Trump ally, Graham’s stance would be unremarkable, except it is the reverse of the policy he staked out as recently as two years ago. At a 2018 Atlantic magazine event, Graham was defending his past votes on Supreme Court nominees when he turned to the issue of timing. ""If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump's term, and the primary process has started, we'll wait until the next election,"" Graham said Oct. 3, 2018. Today, not only has the primary process started — and ended — but Ginsburg’s death came just 46 days before the presidential election. Graham’s 2018 comment was consistent with the firm timetable he laid out in 2016 at a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting. ""If there's a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said let's let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination,"" Graham said March 10, 2016.  ""And you could use my words against me, and you'd be absolutely right.""

Fact-checking Facebook post about polling on legal immigration
","A Facebook post from a group that favors strict immigration policies claimed that nearly 2 out of 3 Americans want to significantly cut the number of people who legally migrate to the United States every year. ""Nearly 2 out of 3 Americans want to reduce legal immigration from 1 million per year down to 500,000 or less,"" said the Sept. 13 Facebook post from NumbersUSA. The post cites as its source a January 2018 poll from the Center for American Political Studies at Harvard and The Harris Poll. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In the January 2018 poll, nearly two-thirds of Americans said the country should legally admit fewer than 500,000 immigrants each year. The poll question did not ask specifically whether respondents favored an increase or decrease, or provide the current number of immigrants who receive lawful permanent resident status.   In another poll, when people were asked if the country should admit fewer, the same or more immigrants, more than 70% said the system should stay the same or be expanded. That poll question similarly did not mention how many immigrants are given a green card per year. The number of people granted lawful permanent residence (a green card) annually hasn’t changed significantly under President Donald Trump, according to the latest data released by the Department of Homeland Security. That number remains around 1 million. It includes people who are newly arriving in the United States and those who have been in the country for some time and are changing their immigration status. Trump has advocated for lower levels of legal immigration and has reduced the number of refugees allowed into the country per year. But he has been less successful in his efforts to eliminate the visa lottery program and to change the legal immigration system so that it favors people with college degrees instead of family members of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. The Harvard-Harris online survey was done Jan. 13-16, 2018, among 1,962 registered voters in the United States. The polling group said that a second flash poll — on taxes and immigration — was done Jan. 17-19 among 980 registered voters. Overall, the pollsters found that most voters support some level of legal immigration, but tended to prefer levels that are below current levels. One of the questions said: ""In your opinion, about how many legal immigrants should be admitted to the U.S. each year?"" The respondents could choose among several ranges, but the question didn’t mention how many people are currently admitted through the legal immigration system and did not directly ask respondents whether they favored an increase or decrease.  A combined 63% supported admitting no more than 499,999 immigrants legally into the country each year. That’s nearly 2 out of 3. Here’s a breakdown: RELATED: Donald Trump’s immigration promises: failures and achievements Other polling groups, including Gallup and the General Social Survey, have also polled voters about immigration levels, with questions that are phrased differently from the January 2018 Harvard-Harris poll. Gallup in June 2018 asked: ""Thinking now about immigrants — that is, people who come from other countries to live here in the United States, in your view, should LEGAL immigration be kept at its present level, increased or decreased?"" A quarter said it should decrease, 34% said it should increase, 38% said it should stay at present level, and 3% had no opinion.  A late 2018 survey from the Public Religion Research Institute said that Americans were divided on restrictions on legal immigration. A slim majority of Americans, 51%, favored passing a law that placed stricter limits on the number of immigrants legally coming to the U.S., while nearly 47% opposed such a law, the survey found.  In a poll this year, Gallup asked: ""Thinking now about immigrants — that is, people who come from other countries to live here in the United States — in your view, should immigration be kept at its present level, increased or decreased?"" In that poll, 28% said immigration should be decreased, 34% said it should be increased, 36% said it should stay at the present level, and 3% had no opinion. The question did not specify whether it was about legal immigration, as the previous Gallup question did, and it did not ask respondents to specify the number of immigrants to be admitted, as did the Harvard-Harris poll.  The Harvard-Harris poll and the other polls are essentially asking about the same topic, but asking in two completely different ways, Chris Chmielenski, deputy director at NumbersUSA, told PolitiFact. Chmielenski said he thinks most people probably don’t realize that about 1 million people a year get green cards. If that fact and similar context were included in polling questions, he argued, then more people would say they want to reduce legal immigration. A NumbersUSA Facebook post said, ""Nearly 2 out of 3 Americans want to reduce legal immigration from 1 million per year down to 500,000 or less."" In a January 2018 poll, nearly two-thirds of Americans said the country should legally admit fewer than 500,000 immigrants each year. The poll question did not point out that 1 million people get green cards each year, or ask respondents specifically whether they favored a reduction or increase. So the NumbersUSA’s claim about Americans wanting to reduce legal immigration is a stretch from the poll's phrasing. Other polls have found broader public support — as much as 72% — for keeping immigration levels the same or increasing them.

Fact-checking Rep. Elissa Slotkin’s record of bipartisanship
","In 2018, Democrat Elissa Slotkin flipped a congressional district Donald Trump won in 2016, unseating the Republican incumbent. Back on the campaign trail, she has told voters in the 8th district that while in Washington, she has worked as an independent and bipartisan lawmaker. Slotkin’s Republican challenger Paul Junge — a former prosecutor and TV anchor — disputes that. ""Candidate Slotkin had presented herself as a moderate and as someone who’d be independent-minded but her time in office is making it increasingly clear that no, she is very partisan, voting 96% of the time with Speaker Pelosi,"" Junge said during a Sept. 11 interview on the WDET radio program ""Detroit Today."" Junge points to the fact that Slotkin has voted 96% of the time with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as evidence that Slotkin is more liberal than her moderate image suggests. Junge has also pointed to the fact that Slotkin has voted 90% of the time with ""The Squad,"" a group of liberal Democratic congresswomen including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. ""Congresswoman Slotkin's record of voting with Nancy Pelosi 96% of the time and 90% with ""squad"" members like Rashida Tlaib make it clear she has aligned herself with the most radical elements of her party after promising to be a moderate. Any thoughtful examination of her record leads to the conclusion that she puts party over country again and again,"" Rob Wagener, spokesman for the Junge campaign, wrote in an email to PolitiFact Michigan. During her interview on ""Detroit Today"" on Sept. 11, Slotkin countered that while in Congress, she has ""voted over 800 times, and 640 of those votes are bipartisan where we’ve got Democrats and Republicans voting for the same bill."" She has also noted that she has voted against her party 55 times. The numbers have changed slightly since the campaign conducted this analysis before Congress’ August recess, but considering Slotkin’s most recent votes generally yields the same result: About 77% of the votes Slotkin has taken during her first term in Congress had the support of at least one Republican member of Congress. ""While there are many ways to define bipartisanship, by any measure, Congresswoman Slotkin is among the most bipartisan members of Congress,"" Gordon Trowbridge, spokesperson for Slotkin’s campaign, wrote in an email to PolitiFact Michigan. Congressional experts say the raw vote figures cited by Junge and Slotkin offer an incomplete picture of a lawmaker’s record of partisanship, and say Slotkin’s definition of bipartisanship as voting the same way as at least one Republican is not very informative. Analysts point instead to other scoring systems that compare lawmakers' voting records with other members of their political party and to their record of collaborating on legislation with members of the other party. For Slotkin, who has branded herself as a moderate and bipartisan member of Congress, these indicators show that her record is indeed consistent with her campaign rhetoric, and that Junge’s characterization of her as a liberal Democrat and very partisan is off the mark. During her first term in Congress, Slotkin has voted the same way as Speaker Pelosi 96% of the time, according to ProPublica, a national investigative news organization. The figure is based on 75 votes cast by Speaker Pelosi who, by tradition, votes at her discretion. Slotkin has also voted 89% of the time with Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Tlaib; and 90% with Rep. Pressley, according to ProPublica. So Slotkin has frequently voted the same way as her party’s leadership. Members of the House often vote consistently with their party's leader. The vast majority of Democratic lawmakers in the current Congress have voted with Pelosi at least 90% of the time. Slotkin has also voted consistently with liberal Democrats. But congressional experts warn against using raw vote totals as an indicator of partisanship. ""Raw vote counts are misleading without context, especially with a high percentage of non-controversial votes,"" wrote Ian Ostrander, an assistant professor of American politics at Michigan State University. ""Some votes matter much more than others."" In response to Junge’s claims, Slotkin pointed out the number of times she has voted with Republican members of Congress and against her own party. An analysis of the most recent data from Voteview shows that Slotkin has voted against her own party 55 times, and that 677 of the 879 votes Slotkin has taken during her term in Congress — about 77% — had the support of at least one Republican member. Experts agree this is not a great definition of bipartisanship. ""By her metric, if she, 230 other Democrats, and one Republican voted for a bill, then she's voting in a bipartisan fashion. That's just silly,"" wrote Christian Fong, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Michigan, in an email to PolitiFact Michigan. Congressional scholars often rely on what’s called the Nominate score, which measures a member’s ideology based on their voting record. The metric, developed by political scientists Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal in the 1980s, provides a general sense of how liberal or conservative a member’s voting record is. UCLA’s Department of Political Science and Social Science Computing computes members' Nominate scores today. Nominate scores fall along a scale of -1 to 1, with -1 being the most liberal end of the spectrum and 1 as the most conservative. Slotkin’s Nominate score is -0.308, making her voting record more conservative than 68% of Democrats in the House. Slotkin’s Nominate score also shows she has staked out less liberal positions on votes than Pelosi. Looking at the measures members have co-sponsored rather than votes, GovTrack, an independent congressional tracker, ranked Slotkin among the most conservative Democrats in Congress in 2019. Fong suggests voters should consider other metrics of bipartisanship too: ""Has she gotten any Republicans to cosponsor her bills? What Republican-led initiatives did she support? Are there any Republican colleagues with whom she's developed a strong working relationship?"" The Bipartisan Index from the Lugar Center and Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy provides some answers. It measures how often lawmakers work with members of the other party on sponsoring and co-sponsoring legislation. It finds Slotkin has frequently co-sponsored bills introduced by the Republican Party and attracted Republican co-sponsors for the bills she has introduced, and ranked her in the top 25% of House lawmakers in 2019. According to GovTrack, 10 of Slotkin’s 15 bills and resolutions in 2019 had a Republican cosponsor. In June 2019, Slotkin joined the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group made up of an equal number of Democratic and Republican House members who try to identify bipartisan policy solutions. Junge said that Slotkin ""presented herself as a moderate"" and ""independent-minded"" but instead she has acted ""very partisan"" during her first term. Independent analyses indicate Slotkin’s voting and legislative records are more conservative and bipartisan than most of her Democratic colleagues’. Junge highlighted one metric — Slotkin’s record of voting with Speaker Pelosi and liberal House members — as evidence. He ignores other metrics that would give a different impression.

Facebook post wrong that four GOP senators are already blocking SCOTUS nomination
","Tensions are high with control of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance, and a Facebook post is offering misleading information about how a Republican nominee to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg might be considered in the Senate. The post was dated Sept. 18, the same day as Ginsburg’s death. It says, ""4 republican senators now on board...no vote until January on (Supreme Court): Murkowski, Romney, Collins, Grassley."" The post is referring to four Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine, and Charles Grassley of Iowa. Under the Senate’s current rules, the Democrats would need to win over four Republican senators to block action on a nominee from President Trump. While these four senators have in the past stated their unease with filling a hypothetical vacancy this late in an election cycle, their past declarations don’t necessarily carry any weight for the decision over the actual Supreme Court vacancy they are now confronted with. The Senate, currently under Republican control, would be able to proceed to consideration of Trump’s nominee with simple majority support. Until 2017, the Senate required 60 votes to proceed to a Supreme Court nomination, but that year the Republicans voted to reduce the number to a simple majority. The lower threshold was used for the first time with the nomination of Neil Gorsuch and was then used again for Brett Kavanaugh. The current partisan breakdown in the Senate is 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats or Democratic-aliged independents. This means that the Democrats could only block the nomination if they can convince four Republicans to oppose it. (Three Republicans wouldn’t be enough, because Vice President Mike Pence, as president of the Senate, would be able to cast a tie-breaking vote for Trump’s nominee.) The Facebook post makes it sound like the four Republicans have already committed to doing so. But their past comments on the topic have addressed a theoretical court vacancy this late in the process, not the actual vacancy we have now. And their past comments are not binding; they could switch their view at any time and vote accordingly. Two of the four senators named in the Facebook post have reiterated their opposition to taking up the expected Trump nomination, but they’ve phrased their words carefully. On Sept. 19, one day after the Facebook post was published, Collins said in a statement, ""Given the proximity of the presidential election ... I do not believe that the Senate should vote on the nominee prior to the election."" On Sept. 20, two days after the post was published, Murkowski said, ""For weeks, I have stated that I would not support taking up a potential Supreme Court vacancy this close to the election. Sadly, what was then a hypothetical is now our reality, but my position has not changed.""  However, even these statements do not back up the Facebook post, since they did not explicitly rule out the option of voting on Trump’s nomination after the election, during the lame duck period before the next Congress is sworn in. That would be allowable under the Senate’s rules, though it would be highly controversial if the Democrats have already won back the presidency and enough seats to control the Senate. As of the afternoon of Sept. 20, neither Romney nor Grassley had taken an official position on consideration of a Trump nominee.  In 2016, Grassley, a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said, ""A lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn’t be denied a voice."" He reiterated this in October 2018, saying the committee, then under his chairmanship, wouldn’t consider a Supreme Court nominee in 2020. ""If I’m chairman they won’t take it up,"" he told Fox News. The current chairman is Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has said he’ll take up Trump’s nomination in committee. (This is a reversal from a position Graham stated as recently as 2018.) Romney, who was the lone Republican to break from his party on the Trump impeachment vote, has not formally commented on how to fill the Ginsburg vacancy. The Facebook post says, ""4 republican senators now on board...no vote until January on (Supreme Court): Murkowski, Romney, Collins, Grassley."" Prior to Ginsburg’s death, three of the four named senators had expressed concerns about a theoretical appointment being filled close to an election.  Two of the senators, Murkowski and Collins, have stated their position since Ginsburg’s death. They both said they opposed a vote before the election, but they did not explicitly rule out a vote after the election during the lame-duck period before a new Congress is sworn in. The other two senators, Romney and Grassley, have not commented about how to proceed with the current vacancy.

Facebook post misleads on number of border apprehensions under Biden, Trump
","Displaced by crime, political instability and the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of migrants from Central America — including unaccompanied children — have arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border over the past few months. Top Republicans in Congress, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, blame the influx on President Joe Biden’s immigration policies. On Facebook, some users have echoed those talking points. ""Sleepy Joe now saying he inherited ‘a mess’ at the border,"" says a March 13 post. ""Fact: 9,000 illegals all of 2020. So far in 2021 108,000 entered U.S."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar posts have been shared thousands of times, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. The Facebook post misattributed the statement —  Biden never said his administration inherited ""a mess"" at the border from former President Donald Trump. That comment came from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. (Screenshot from Facebook) ""Let me just say this: Joe Biden inherited a huge mess on immigration, and it’s not going to be cleaned up in a month,"" Schumer said on a March 11 episode of ""The View."" Other Democrats have made similar remarks, but not Biden himself. Still, we wanted to take a closer look at the Facebook post’s claim about border crossings under Trump and Biden. The post is wrong — there were far more than 9,000 apprehensions at the southwest border in 2020. The Facebook post doesn’t specify an area of the border or a kind of Border Patrol encounter, so we looked at statistics about apprehensions along the entire southwest border with Mexico.  In March 2020, Trump invoked Title 42, a federal public health law, to allow border officials to quickly expel migrants on the grounds that their entry could contribute to the spread of COVID-19. That means migrants arriving without permission now face either apprehension and removal proceedings, or immediate expulsion.  According to the latest Border Patrol data, there have been 381,636 encounters at the southwest border during the 2021 fiscal year, which started in October. Of those, 64,046 encounters were apprehensions, meaning migrants were taken into custody between ports of entry, and the rest were Title 42 expulsions. In January and February, when Biden was president, there were 172,286 encounters and 39,572 apprehensions. By comparison, there were 400,651 southwest border encounters during the 2020 fiscal year, which spanned from October 2019 to September 2020. Of those, more than 200,000 were apprehensions. It’s important to note that Border Patrol data on encounters refers to events — not people. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a March 16 statement that officials are seeing a surge in attempted border crossings this year. ""This is not new. We have experienced migration surges before — in 2019, 2014, and before then as well,"" Mayorkas said in the statement. ""Since April 2020, the number of encounters at the southwest border has been steadily increasing."" The 108,000 figure in the claim appears to stem from something Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said during a March 9 press conference about immigrants entering the country illegally.  ""In all of last year, in the Rio Grande Valley Sector there were about 90,000 apprehensions,"" Abbott said, citing U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. ""Just this year there have been 108,000 apprehensions there."" The Rio Grande Valley Sector is a Border Patrol service area that covers more than 34,000 square miles of southeast Texas. There are 19 other sectors on the northern and southern borders that report their own apprehension statistics.

Wisconsin cleared one backlog of unemployment claims in late 2020, but other backlogs exist
","Over the past year, since the coronavirus pandemic began, Wisconsin’s unemployment system has faced a host of issues.  Flooded with applications as stores, restaurants and other businesses shut down or closed entirely, the state Department of Workforce Development struggled to keep up with claims.  The situation was complicated by an outdated computer system, one that had to be reprogrammed to accommodate unique elements of the pandemic response, such as bonus payments from the federal government. Employees were transferred from other departments to help with the influx of claims, and new employees were hired to answer the phones and adjudicate cases. Still, by mid-summer more than 100,000 claims were waiting for adjudication, leaving thousands of Wisconsinites struggling to buy food and pay rent. (In many cases, one person had multiple weekly claims awaiting review and approval). In September, Gov. Tony Evers asked the head of the department to resign. The new head, Amy Pechacek, launched a partnership with Google and on Dec. 30, 2020 -- in her first news release as secretary-designee of the department -- declared: ""Since the start of the pandemic, our top priority at DWD has been ensuring that all eligible unemployment claims in Wisconsin are paid as quickly as possible. Today, I am proud to say we have reached our goal to clear the backlog of claims."" Now, typically we don’t examine claims that are more than two months old. And we won’t blame a backlog for our tardiness. Rather, we’ll note that this is a good point -- one year since the pandemic began -- to examine where the backlog issue stands. Of course, we’ll examine things as they stood when the claim was made. That said, many things remain the same as they did at the close of 2020 when the backlog was declared eliminated. So, was Pechacek right?  When asked about the clearing of the backlog, department spokesperson Amy Barrilleaux told PolitiFact Wisconsin that it was absolutely cleared by Dec. 30, 2020.  All claims 21 days or older, she said, had been assigned to an adjudicator at that point, which in the eyes of the U.S. Department of Labor means the claim has been processed.  But even though all the claims had been assigned to adjudicators, unemployed Wisconsinites still had to wait for their claims to be resolved, which can take days or weeks, depending on the complexity of the claim -- a point Barrilleaux acknowledged.  At the time the department announced the end of the backlog, there were 9,000 claims assigned for adjudication, going to about 500 adjudicators, according to a Dec. 30, 2020 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report.  Asked if any outstanding claims from 2020 are still in adjudication, Barrilleaux would not say, but she noted no claims from 2020 are awaiting assignment to an adjudicator.  At this stage in 2021, there are roughly 2,100 claims awaiting adjudication, and on average claims are being assigned to an adjudicator after 7.4 days, far less than the 21 days considered standard for non-pandemic years.  So, while the state touted the backlog was eliminated, it didn’t mean everyone had their case resolved. Similarly, a backlog of appeals was not cleared up. When an unemployment claim is denied, the applicant can seek an appeal hearing, in which the claimant and former employer go before an administrative law judge.  According to another Dec. 30, 2020 report from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Pechacek acknowledged the backlog, and said the department was working to hire more administrative law judges to manage the load of appeals. At that time, Pechacek estimated about 15,000 appeals were awaiting assignment to a judge, a number she said was too high.  But since then, the number of appeals awaiting assignment has continued to grow, not shrink.  As of Feb. 20, 2021, more than 16,117 appeals were still pending, according to the department website.  Barrilleaux said that the backlog of appeals is mostly caused by a lack of judges and the historic volume of appeals. About 50,000 people filed an appeal in 2020, and 30,972 of those cases had moved through the appeals process as of January, Barrilleaux said.  The department is currently hearing appeals from September. 
  At the end of December, Pechacek said the state had eliminated its backlog of unemployment claims. That was accurate, at least by the measure used by the Department of Labor. But on a practical level, that didn’t mean that the cases had all been resolved. To the contrary, many cases had simply been assigned to an adjudicator at that point, and were awaiting a final decision. And a high volume of appeals meant a delay at that stage as well. Our definition of Half True is ""The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.""

Biden not to blame for rising diesel (or gas) prices
","A new party in the White House means it’s time for a time-honored American tradition — the blame game. Anything wrong in the world is now the fault of the two-month old administration. Or the fault of the prior administration, depending on your political persuasion. With gas prices on the move, this exercise is in full effect on social media. That includes a widely-shared March 10, 2021 Facebook post. ""When Sleepy Joe Came In Diesel Was $1.69,"" it reads. ""Today Diesel Is $3.19. Thanks To All That Voted For This Clown."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). This poster gets it wrong on both the specifics and the blame. Here’s why. Diesel prices are indeed up. The March 15 national average of $3.07 was the highest since June 2019. But the numbers in the post are way off the mark. The national average price for diesel was $2.64 per gallon on Jan. 20 when President Joe Biden, a Democrat, took the oath of office, according to GasBuddy.com price trackers. That’s almost a dollar higher than the post claims. Meanwhile, the March 10 national average was $3.04, less than the post claimed. So, there was an increase, but a far smaller one. Weekly price data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows similar movement, from $2.70 to $3.14 based on the weeks closest to those points in time. In Wisconsin, meanwhile, diesel rose from $2.50 to $2.90 between January 20 and March 10, according to GasBuddy. The poster did not respond to a message from PolitiFact Wisconsin seeking evidence of his claim. He lives in Iowa, according to his profile, but using local numbers doesn’t help his case much. GasBuddy shows prices in Des Moines rose over that span from $2.45 to $3.00 per gallon, a slightly larger jump, but still far from the post’s claim. The post — like many others pointing a finger at Biden over prices at the pump — is also wrong on the fundamental blame element. The price movement we’re seeing now on both diesel and gas isn’t related to Biden’s policy changes, experts say. For starters, the trend predates Biden. Diesel prices have steadily risen since the start of November, when Republican President Donald Trump was in office. And Biden’s policies aren’t having any immediate impact. Biden shut down the planned Keystone XL pipeline expansion, which was to run from Canada to Nebraska. Experts consulted by PolitiFact said that decision could make oil transportation less efficient longterm, but even then they doubted it would directly affect US costs. Reuters reports existing pipelines and ongoing expansions are expected to be sufficient for the flow between the U.S. and Canada, which provides about half of America’s imported oil. The president also imposed a 60-day ban on new fracking permits, but that doesn’t affect existing operations. Oil producers weren’t likely to be pursuing new locations now anyhow since they’re scrambling to bring back online production that was scaled back in 2020, experts say. In reality, diesel and gas prices — like many things in 2021 — are all about the pandemic. The reduction of economic activity, and people traveling and moving around less, reduced demand for diesel and gas both in 2020, causing a related drop in oil production amid steep financial losses in the oil industry. The Energy Information Administration, an independent government agency that provides analysis for policymakers and the public, said demand for diesel fell 8% in 2020, while demand for gas dropped by 13%. Demand is now rising quickly as the COVID-19 picture improves and the economy rebounds, but it takes time to get the supply back to normal. The Energy Information Administration says crude oil production in the U.S. was down in 2020 and will drop again in 2021 ""as a result of a decline in drilling activity related to low oil prices."" It projects an increase in 2022. ""We’re headed for higher (price) territory until the market sees more crude oil, whether that’s supplied from the U.S. or Canadian interests or OPEC,"" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy.com. ""We are in a pretty significant imbalance. Demand has screamed higher, and production has been moving at a turtle’s pace, and part of that is because the depths of the crisis were so severe for oil companies."" Energy and security analyst Patricia Schouker described the same dynamic to AFP, a France-based global news agency, saying recovering demand and limited production has ""pushed crude prices to their highest levels since near the start of the coronavirus pandemic."" Outside of market-altering events like the pandemic, prices of both fuels are driven primarily by the cost of crude oil, which is in turn driven by an array of world economic conditions that influence supply and demand. As Schouker noted, presidents have ""‘very little direct influence"" over gas and diesel prices.  De Haan said the irony of blaming Biden is that the increasing demand is related to the growing economy. So the people prone to wrongly blame Biden for gas prices would also be slow to credit him for the economy, even though those are two sides of the same coin. A Facebook post claims Diesel prices have risen from $1.69 to $3.19 since Biden took office, blaming him for that jump. The numbers aren’t close to right — the actual increase was more like 40 cents, not $1.50. The blame element is equally off base. Diesel (and gas) prices are rising due to swelling demand as movement and economic activity increase amid the coronavirus recovery. Expert say it could take until 2022 for oil production to return to pre-pandemic levels, causing a shortage in the meantime that will drive prices up.

Did the increase of children arriving at the border start under Trump or Biden?
","The rising numbers of children arriving alone at the southern border pose ""an enormous challenge,"" but President Joe Biden’s election isn’t what triggered the surge, said U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas. What’s happening at the border is ""the consequence of four years of dismantling every system in place to address this with humanity and compassion,"" Escobar told Jake Tapper, co-host of CNN’s State of the Union on March 14. She added: ""I do want to also point out, Jake, that we began seeing the increase in unaccompanied minors going back to last April 2020. This is not something that happened as a result of Joe Biden becoming president. We saw the increases dating back almost a year. And this was during the Trump administration."" Rep. Veronica Escobar says an influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border is “an enormous challenge and it’s unacceptable.”“What we are seeing today is the consequence of four years of dismantling every system in place to address this with humanity and compassion.” #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/HtPRCmIHmP Is Escobar right that the rise started under the Trump administration? Yes, the increase did start about a year ago. At this point though, there’s not enough data to measure to what extent Biden’s election has influenced migration. Border officials publish migration data by month, not day. So far, February is the only full month Biden has been in office. Escobar is correct that arrivals at the southern border began increasing almost a year ago, before Biden was elected president. But the arrival of unaccompanied children increased sharply since January. Border Patrol’s ""encounters"" count includes people who are taken into the custody of agents between ports of entry and people who are quickly expelled from trying to enter the country under a public health rule launched in March 2020. Data shows that Border Patrol encounters went down in April 2020 compared with March 2020, but picked up in May 2020. The numbers have generally been increasing since then, for all migrants and for unaccompanied minors. (There was a slight decrease from October to November in the encounters of unaccompanied children.) Border Patrol data tracks events, not people. If a person tries to cross the border three times in a one month and is expelled each time, Border Patrol records three expulsions, for instance. About three weeks into Biden’s administration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection released January data which showed a continued increase in attempted monthly border crossings. ""The uptick seems to be occurring in a small fraction of locations across the southwest border, which is consistent with trends in years past,"" said Troy Miller, a CBP senior official performing the duties of the commissioner. The agency tied the increase to several factors, including crime and instability in migrants’ home countries and ""inaccurate perceptions"" of changes in immigration and border policies. Smugglers have taken advantage of Biden’s election, said David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. ""Some migrants do believe that Biden will be more favorable to them, that's largely based on the smugglers' misinformation and propaganda and a very small slice of truth,"" Bier said. But Bier maintained that if Donald Trump had won re-election, these smugglers would have changed their sales pitch, promoting tunnels and other ways to get into the United States. White House officials have acknowledged that despite their message that the border is closed, smugglers are telling people a different story. ""When we talk about the border not being open and the ways in which we’re trying to dissuade people from making that dangerous journeys, the smugglers are conveying exactly the opposite to people,"" said Roberta S. Jacobson, who oversees border issues in the Biden administration, March 10. The arrival of unaccompanied children is something that seems to ebb and flow, regardless of who is president, said Tony Payan, director of the Center for the United States and Mexico at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. Payan said it’s too early to tell if Biden’s policies are what’s driving an increase in recent arrivals, because other factors that prompt migration still exist. More people tend to come in the spring and the summer. And high poverty and crime in Central America — factors that push people out of their countries — have not changed, he said. Some Trump policies spurred the arrival of unaccompanied children, Bier said. Under the Trump-era Remain in Mexico program, families who asked for asylum in the United States were sent to Mexico to wait there as their cases moved through the system. It can take months or years for U.S. authorities to process asylum claims, so many migrants set up makeshift tents in border towns to wait. Unaccompanied children were generally not turned away under the program. So when families realized they could ""face months or years of homelessness in very dangerous cities in Mexico, many parents and their kids decided to separate,"" Bier wrote in a blog post. Also, when the Trump administration began expelling migrants under the public health rule, it applied to single travelers, unaccompanied children and families. But a federal judge in November ordered the Trump administration to stop expelling unaccompanied children. As a result of that court ruling, Bier said, many parents who were once expelled along with their children decided to send their kids back to the United States alone so they'd be let in. But Biden is the one setting policy now ""and his policies are partly contributing to what's happening at the border,"" Bier said. For example, an appeals court in January said that the federal government could resume expelling unaccompanied children. Yet, the Biden administration continues to accept unaccompanied children, Bier said. Biden’s administration also has started letting in asylum seekers who were waiting in Mexico and stopped enrolling people in the Remain in Mexico program. ""There is a risk that more migrants, especially those faced with the harshest push factors, may think that there is a greater chance to get into the U.S. now that asylum seekers are being processed inside the U.S.,"" Payan said. Escobar said of unaccompanied minors at the southern border, ""We saw the increases dating back almost a year."" It is true that the rise started in spring 2020 during the Trump administration. But it’s also worth noting that there was a sharp increase this year from January to February. Biden’s election and misleading messaging from smugglers may have influenced some people to migrate to the U.S. More data in coming months will help better gauge the impact his election and policies have on migration.

Experts: Tillis 'wrong' to compare small-dollar donations with 'dark money'
","North Carolina’s junior senator made national headlines this week for suggesting that different types of campaign donations have the same level of influence over elections. Republican Thom Tillis offered comments during a March 10 committee meeting on the influence of money in federal judicial races, The Hill reported.  Tillis noted that while donors who give large amounts to certain political committees have their identities concealed, so do people who donate small amounts to candidates. Video of the full meeting is on C-SPAN’s website. (Tillis starts talking around the one hour and 25-minute mark.)  Here’s part of what he said. ""We’re talking about dark money ... In the weekend after the untimely death of Justice Ginsburg, my opponent through his campaign account raised $6 million over 48 hours. And that comes from a new tool that we have which I’ll call ‘Dem-money.’ That’s aggregation tools that give $50, $200, $250 below any sort of reporting limit that are doing the same thing. I don’t hear anybody on the Democrats’ side saying they want to get rid of those tools. So they’re not suggesting a disarmament of both sides. They’ve simply found another way to do exactly the same thing: people providing money to candidates and influencing elections."" Is it true that small, aggregated donations are ""exactly the same"" as big dark money donations? Experts say this is an oversimplification. Tillis is incorrect in saying the identities of people making small donations are kept secret. It’s also a stretch to suggest a small-dollar donor can influence elections and candidates in the same way that a large, dark-money donor can. ""They’re as far apart as they can be within the same category. It’s less apples and oranges and more oranges and kumquats,"" said Brendan Quinn, outreach and social media manager for the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks election spending. Tillis has a point in one regard. There are some types of political donations for which laws don’t require the identity of the donor to be disclosed. Here’s an explanation. Donations to certain groups: The term ""dark money"" typically refers to political spending where the source of funds is unknown. Typically this spending is done by 501(c) nonprofits. Laws don’t require these groups to disclose the names of their donors, and there’s often no limit to how much a donor can give. Some of the biggest spending by these groups happens through donations to super PACs, which operate as independent expenditure-only committees and are not allowed to directly coordinate with candidates they support. While super PACs are required to disclose their donors, some nonprofits and shell companies can legally give unlimited amounts of money to those super PACs without having to tell the public where those funds came from. The Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) reports that dark money accounted for $750 million in spending during the 2020 election. Meanwhile, fully transparent donations accounted for only 30% of all outside spending, which the center says is an all-time low. Donations to candidates: Candidates are required to disclose the identity of most of their donors. This includes people or businesses that donate things besides money, such as food or event venues.  However, federal and state laws don’t require the same level of transparency for the smallest donations. At the federal level, candidates for Congress and the presidency are required to disclose the names of people who donate $200 or more. At the state level, rules for donation disclosures vary.  Small-donor disclosure laws for each state are available on a map created by The National Institute for Money in Politics, a nonprofit group advocating for election transparency. Florida and Michigan have the strictest laws, requiring disclosures for donations of any size. North Carolina is also on the stricter end of the spectrum, requiring candidates to disclose donations of more than $50. New Jersey and Nebraska have looser rules, requiring information only on those who donate more than $300 or $250, respectively. Donations to intermediaries: Here’s something Tillis overlooked in his comments. While candidates aren’t required to report the identities of small-dollar donors, groups that process those donations are required to report them.  If you donate $20 to a candidate, that candidate may not disclose your name or address in his campaign finance reports. However, if that candidate uses an ""intermediary or conduit"" to collect donations, that company will list your name in its report. Popular intermediaries are ActBlue for Democrats and WinRed for Republicans. (Tillis was likely referring to ActBlue when he mentioned ""Dem-money."") While each group is classified as a political action committee by the Federal Election Commission, they have other accounts that serve only to facilitate donations.  In other words, ActBlue and WinRed are middle-man platforms that provide a service like PayPal does for online purchases. Some pundits and politicians have gotten these facts wrong. When it comes to small-dollar donations, experts told PolitiFact that Tillis’s statement is wrong on at least two fronts.  1. It’s inaccurate for Tillis to suggest the identities of small-time donors remain hidden. While candidates don’t reveal those donors’ names, their processing companies do.  For a look at how these donations are reported, check out this 2020 report from presidential candidate Bernie Sanders or this report for Democrat Cal Cunningham, who Tillis mentioned in his speech. Donations made through ActBlue will show up on two lines of the report. On one line, the report lists the donor’s name and contribution. On the line below that, the report shows ActBlue’s name, its status as a ""conduit,"" and then the disclaimer: ""Above Contribution earmarked through this organization."" ""Contributions from small donors through the ActBlue and WinRed platforms are not the same thing as 'dark money,' in that they are disclosed by those platforms regardless of how small by law,"" said Pete Quist, research director for the National Institute on Money in Politics. ActBlue includes that disclaimer on its website. ""Sen. Tillis is wrong,"" said Michael J. Malbin, professor of political science at the Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy. ""His statement that candidates do not have to disclose their donors until they give an aggregate of more than $200 is correct, but ActBlue itself discloses all of the contributions for which it is the conduit -- no matter how small.""  2. Experts say it’s also misleading to equate the influence of small donations and big anonymous donations.  Tillis’ statement ""is wrong on a general level because small money donors aren’t really buying influence,"" said Brendan Fischer, director of the Campaign Legal Center’s federal reform program. No donor who gives $25 or $75 to a candidate is going to get special attention from that candidate. But a ""dark money"" advertising push worth millions is inevitably going to attract attention, even if the donor’s identity isn’t disclosed. A 2014 study by researchers at Ohio State University’s College of Law found that, even if candidates didn’t always agree with the position of corporations that fund dark money political groups, candidates were keenly aware of the group’s spending and presence in the political landscape. ""Members of Congress see independent spending as a threat – usually implicit but sometimes explicit – for those who refuse to toe the line of outside groups,"" the Ohio State researchers wrote in their executive summary. The scale of the spending is different, too. Small donations accounted for 26% of all donations in the 2020 federal elections, according to a joint study by the Center for Responsive Politics and the National Institute on Money in Politics.  While small donations to federal candidates increased, donations to state-level candidates remained relatively flat. Small donations in gubernatorial contests, for example, accounted for 11% of donations, down from 16% in 2012. When it comes to these small-dollar donations, Tillis at one point said liberals are raising ""10 to 20 fold what conservative candidates do."" Experts say it’s also misleading for Tillis to suggest that Democrats dominate small-dollar donations or that Republicans have an advantage on large-dollar dark money donations.  In the 2020 election, the CRP found that Republican candidates for House received a higher percentage of small-dollar donations than Democratic candidates did. Meanwhile, the center also found that liberals benefited more from dark money than conservatives. Tillis’ office didn’t respond to emails from PolitiFact asking for further explanation of his March 10 comments.  While talking about dark money, Tillis said small donations through aggregation tools are the ""same thing"" as anonymous donations to political groups. This is misleading. While it’s true that some types of political donations aren’t reported, it’s inaccurate to say the names of people who donate through aggregators -- a type of donation that Tillis specifically mentioned -- aren’t reported. They are. Beyond that, experts say it’s wrong to compare the influence of a small donor with those of deep-pocketed outside interests, since the scale of the latter’s donations will carry far more weight with the candidate. Tillis’ statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/mar/17/thom-tillis/experts-tillis-wrong-compare-small-dollar-donation/

Social media posts mislead about transgender MMA fighter’s injuries to opponents
","With federal efforts underway to expand transgender rights, claims about transgender people have been rampant, and participation in sports is one particular area of focus.  One claim making the rounds on social media takes aim at retired transgender MMA fighter Fallon Fox, whose last bout was in 2014. The Facebook post says, ""Fallon (Fox), a transgender MMA fighter, has now broken 2 female opponents’ skulls,"" and shows a photo of Fox alongside an MMA fighter with a severely bloodied face. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) During her two-year MMA career, Fox had one bout that resulted in facial injuries to her opponent — which is not uncommon in MMA — but the Facebook post gets most details wrong. Fox did not break two people’s skulls. And she did not cause the injuries of or ever fight the bloodied person pictured in the post. Fox is a transgender woman whose sex at birth was male; she underwent gender reassignment surgery in 2006. When she went public with her story in 2013, she became the first openly transgender woman athlete to compete in MMA.  The Facebook post implies that because Fox’s sex at birth was male, she maintains a physical advantage over her opponents and, as a result, is causing serious injuries. But a study in the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine found that MMA fights have an overall high rate of injury, and that the majority of recorded injuries were to the face.  During a 2014 fight, Fox defeated Tamikka Brents by knockout. One report at the time from a news outlet that covers MMA said that Brents had a concussion, broken orbital bone and required seven staples in her head.  Fox has commented on her bout against Brents several times on Twitter.  In June 2020, when someone accused her of smashing two women’s skulls open, Fox tweeted, ""For the record, I knocked two out. One woman’s skull was fractured, the other not. And just so you know, I enjoyed it.""  In October 2020, replying to a tweet that has since been deleted, Fox tweeted, ""I fractured Tamikka Brents skull. And other women have done the same in the sport. You try to make it seem as if I’m the only one who could do that. Why?""  Then, in February 2021, Fox described Brents’ injuries in different terms. Responding to a claim that seems to mirror the one we are checking, Fox tweeted, ""The rumor’s kinda based on another fight where I fractured opponent Tamikka Brents orbital bone years ago. They said I ‘broke her skull.’ As if it split in half & she died. Now there’s rumors that I broke 2 women’s skulls. Never broken anyone’s skull. It’s an orbital fracture!"" In the Facebook post about Fox, the photo that accompanies the claim juxtaposes images of a bloodied fighter and Fox giving thumbs-up signs. The bloodied person pictured is Kay Hansen, who started fighting in MMA bouts in 2017, three years after Fox’s last bout.  The fight that caused those injuries to Hansen took place in March 2018 against Kal Schwartz, and a media report at the time said that Schwartz ""paint(ed) her opponent red"" when blood poured out of a wound.  Fox addressed the photo in a series of tweets last month, saying, ""So tired of the fake news circulating that I broke this woman’s skull. The upper photo is fake. ...It was Kal Schwartz — a cis woman — who caused the damage to opponent Kay Hansen that I’m being blamed for!"" A Facebook post says, ""Fallon (Fox), a transgender MMA fighter, has now broken 2 female opponents’ skulls,"" and shows a photo of Fox alongside an MMA fighter with a severely bloodied face. Fox fractured one opponent’s orbital bone; she did not break two people’s skulls. The photo that juxtaposes Fox with bloodied MMA fighter Kay Hansen is misleading and inaccurate. Hansen’s injuries were sustained in a 2018 fight with Kal Schwartz, and the fight took place years after Fox’s last MMA bout. The claim contains an element of truth because one person sustained a head injury in a fight with Fox, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression and includes a photo that has no association with Fox. We rate this claim Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2021/mar/16/facebook-posts/social-media-posts-mislead-about-transgender-mma-f/

No, federal relief dollars for San Francisco won’t pay for pot, alcohol for homeless
","The Democrats and President Joe Biden are making a full court press to tell Americans about the many ways their COVID-19 relief package will put money in their pockets. Republicans are working just as hard to paint the $1.9 trillion law as a colossal waste of government funds. ""Nancy Pelosi’s Bay Area Bailout included $600 million for San Francisco, part of which goes to cover the tab for free alcohol and marijuana for the homeless,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted March 14. ""I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: this bailout is too costly, corrupt, and liberal."" Did you know? — Nancy Pelosi’s Bay Area Bailout included $600 million for San Francisco, part of which goes to cover the tab for free alcohol and marijuana for the homeless.I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: this bailout is too costly, corrupt, and liberal. pic.twitter.com/K6vabaCeKu Does the federal relief package really pay for San Francisco to provide free weed and booze for the homeless? Let’s sort this out. City officials say the American Rescue Plan Act — which contains $360 billion in aid to state and local governments — will send San Francisco about $600 million over the next two years. The city can decide how to spend the money to help recover from damage wrought by the pandemic.  McCarthy mangled the facts in tying the relief package to what’s taking place with people — not just homeless people — whom the city puts up in hotels to isolate them when they’ve been exposed to the coronavirus. After a COVID-19 outbreak at a San Francisco homeless shelter in April 2020, the city moved to isolate more homeless people in hotels. The isolation and quarantine program grew to include people who weren’t homeless but who lived in cramped quarters where it was impossible to stay away from others.  In May, word spread that staff were providing some of these people with marijuana and alcohol. A local activist went on Twitter to call out the practice, and the city public health department defended itself. ""These harm-reduction based practices, which are not unique to San Francisco, and are not paid for with taxpayer money, help guests successfully complete isolation and quarantine and have significant individual and public health benefits in the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the department tweeted May 5, 2020. A flawed news report miscast a statement from the health department as indicating that it provided marijuana. Part of the confusion was that the city’s practices involving alcohol were separate from those involving marijuana.  Let’s look at the alcohol policy first. Jenna Lane, a spokeswoman for the city health department, told us that the key to isolating people during a pandemic is to keep them in their rooms. For homeless people with severe alcoholism, going cold turkey was a health risk. ""Medical providers prescribed limited amounts of alcohol to be served with a meal to just those guests who would otherwise go into alcohol withdrawal,"" Lane said. ""Alcohol withdrawal can be fatal."" Some alcoholics got vodka, some got beer. Lane said these people represented a small fraction of the homeless whom the city took care of in its isolation and quarantine program. City staff supported everyone who was in recovery and helped them stay substance-free. As of the time of this fact-check, there were 23 people in isolation and quarantine. San Francisco provides alcohol only in the isolation and quarantine program. Until May 4, 2020, the city relied on private donations to pay for the vodka and beer for residents. In the ensuing 10 months, the city spent $14,940 in public funds to provide alcohol, or about $1,500 each month. Lane said the city never paid for marijuana.  Some people in the city’s isolation program used marijuana while quarantining in a city-provided hotel room. California allows personal use of marijuana.  These residents paid for the drug themselves.  ""If someone had a prescription for medical cannabis, staff might receive prescription deliveries at the front entrance of the hotel,"" Lane said. ""They would accept it on behalf of a guest. But no staff facilitated recreational purchases."" In November, the city announced measures to relocate about 2,300 people who were then staying in hotels. The goal was to end the hotel program by the end of June 2021. Drew Hammill, spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, told us, ""There are no federal funds being used for these purposes."" We reached out to McCarthy’s office and did not hear back. McCarthy said the federal relief package has ""$600 million for San Francisco, part of which goes to cover the tab for free alcohol and marijuana for the homeless."" Since May 2020, San Francisco has spent about $1,500 of public money each month to provide medically prescribed alcohol to people with severe alcoholism in COVID-19 isolation and quarantine sites for homeless people. No federal money has been allotted to this program, which is due to end in June. The city does not provide marijuana to people at quarantine sites.

Claim blaming COVID vaccine for Hank Aaron, Marvin Hagler deaths lacks evidence
","A social media post by former Major League Baseball player Aubrey Huff appears to blame the deaths of two sports legends on the coronavirus vaccine. Huff, who has made several social media posts questioning vaccines, made his claim the day after Hagler’s death. His March 14 Instagram post read: ""Hammering Hank Aaron...now Marvelous Marvin Hagler two legends dead after taking the #covid19 vaccine."" The widely shared post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There’s no evidence that either man’s death was related to COVID-19 vaccines. Huff did not reply to our email. Aaron broke Babe Ruth’s home run record in 1974, and his 755 home runs ranks second behind the 762 hit by Barry Bonds, who broke Aaron’s record in 2007.  Aaron died at age 86 on Jan. 22, 17 days after he chose to receive the COVID-19 vaccination publicly in hope that other Black people would get the shot. The Fulton County (Ga.) Medical Examiner’s office said Aaron’s death was not linked to the vaccine.  We rated as False a claim that said otherwise. Hagler, who legally changed his name to Marvelous Marvin Hagler to include his nickname, was a middleweight champion in the 1980s and is a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame.  His wife, Kay Hagler, announced March 13 on Hagler’s fan club page on Facebook that Hagler died unexpectedly that day at their New Hampshire home. She didn’t mention a cause of death.  Hagler was 66.  The next day, Kay Hagler posted another message on the same page, saying in part: ""I would like to speak with my heart to all of you. I apologize if my English is not written correctly but I hope everyone understands me in this difficult moment. ...I was the only person close to him until the last minute, and I am the only person that know how things went not even his family know all the details and I do NOT accept to read some stupid comment without knowing really what happen. For sure wasn't the vaccine that caused his death. My baby left in peace with his usually smile and now is not the time to talk nonsense."" MarvelousMarvin.com, the boxer’s official website, said Hagler died of natural causes near his home. One of Hagler’s children, James Hagler, told TMZ that his father was taken to a New Hampshire hospital on March 13 after experiencing trouble breathing and chest pains at home. That was several hours before he died, according to TMZ. We contacted the New Hampshire Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to ask whether Hagler received a COVID-19 vaccine and what caused his death, and were referred to the state attorney general’s office. A spokeswoman said the medical examiner ""will accept jurisdiction for unexplained and non-natural deaths,"" but that Hagler’s death ""did not fall under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner."" Rumors of Hagler’s death being related to a COVID-19 vaccine can be traced to one of his former rivals. Thomas ""Hitman"" Hearns, a Hall of Fame boxer who was defeated by Hagler in a championship fight in 1985, said in a March 13 Instagram post with a photo of Hagler: ""A real true warrior Pray for the king and his family.. he’s in ICU fighting the after effects of the vaccine! He’ll be just fine but we could use the positive energy and Prayer for his Full Recovery!"" After Hagler’s death, Hearns wrote on Instagram, according to The Daily Mail: ""Our love and respect to Marvin and his family, this is not an anti vaccine campaign.. it's outrageous to have that in mind during the passing of a King, Legend, Father, Husband and so much more."" That post apparently has been deleted. Aubrey Huff claimed that Hank Aaron and Marvelous Marvin Hagler died ""after taking the COVID-19 vaccine,"" suggesting that the deaths were linked to the vaccine. The medical examiner said Aaron’s death was natural and not linked to the vaccine.

Wisconsin is one of three states, not nine, where 17-year-olds are adults in justice system
","One of the little-discussed aspects of Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers 2021-22 budget is a series of proposed changes related to the juvenile justice system. Among them: Evers would raise the age for automatically charging someone as an adult from 17 to 18 — an idea Republican lawmakers rejected two years ago.  In a Feb. 16, 2021 news release, state Rep. LaKeshia Myers, D-Milwaukee, commended Evers on the moves. ""By restructuring the Department of Corrections Division of Juvenile Corrections (DJC) to include older teenagers, we will end the practice of criminalizing young offenders and waiving them into adult prisons,"" Myers said. ""Wisconsin is one of only nine states in the nation in which 17 year-olds are automatically treated as adults in the criminal justice system."" Is Myers correct? Not exactly. When asked to provide backup for the statement, Myers’ office directed us to several articles, including a Nov. 1, 2014 Wisconsin Bar Association piece titled ""Adults Only: Returning 17 year olds to Juvenile Court"" and an Oct. 19, 2015 Appleton Post Crescent article ""Lawmakers: Keep 17-year-olds from adult court.""  That article noted that a review showed ""Wisconsin is one of just nine states nationwide that prosecutes all 17-year-olds charged with a crime or municipal ordinance violation as adults. In two states, New York and North Carolina, adult court begins even earlier: at age 16.""  The same fact was cited in a June 11,  2018 blog entry on the website for the law firm Gimbel, Reilly, Guerin and Brown LLP.  Alas, what was true in 2014, 2015 and 2018 is no longer true in 2021, due to legislative activity on the issue in recent years.  In a July 1, 2020 report, the National Conference of State Legislatures said that in 47 states, the maximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction is age 17. That is, those who are age 17, are not automatically tried as an adult. ""Three states -- Georgia, Texas and Wisconsin -- now draw the juvenile/adult line at age 16,"" the NCSL report states. That is, those who are 16 are not automatically tried as an adult, but those who have turned 17 are.  An official with NCSL said in the past seven years states have passed legislation that modified the ages of youth who fall under the jurisdiction of juvenile courts and they have also modified waiver laws, which apply to cases where a younger person may be  tried in adult court in certain cases after a hearing by a judge. ""You can look at it like age of jurisdiction laws are the ‘rule’ and transfer laws are the ‘exceptions to the rule,’"" Anne Teigen, program director of the NCSL’s  juvenile justice program, said in an email. ""States have enacted legislation that have changed both."" All states have transfer laws that allow or require young offenders to be prosecuted as adults for specific serious offenses, regardless of their age. Teigen noted that since many of the ""Raise the Age"" laws were passed recently — including in New York, North Carolina, Missouri and Michigan — not all have been fully implemented. The bottom line here, though, is that Wisconsin is currently one of three, not one of nine.  So, in that respect, Myers’ general point -- that Wisconsin is an outlier -- is even more on target, but she is using outdated information to make her point. Myers said ""Wisconsin is one of only nine states in the nation in which 17 year-olds are automatically treated as adults in the criminal justice system."" That was true at one time, but the current number is three. So, the underlying point is on target, but the statistic cited is off. Our definition for Half True is ""the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.""  That fits here.    ",/factchecks/2021/mar/16/lakeshia-myers/wisconsin-one-three-states-not-nine-where-17-year-/

Nancy Pelosi repeats incomplete talking point on 2017 GOP tax bill
","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., recently revived a longstanding Democratic criticism of the tax bill signed in 2017 by President Donald Trump. In a March 14 interview on ABC’s ""This Week,"" host George Stephanopoulos pressed Pelosi on a possible future infrastructure bill. Pelosi said she wanted to be ""fiscally sound"" in assembling such a bill, and drew a contrast with the Republican tax bill of 2017. An infrastructure bill, she said, would be ""job-creating, which creates revenue that comes back to the Treasury, unlike what the (Republicans) did with their tax scam in 2017, which gave 83% of the benefits to the top 1% percent and indebted our children to the tune of nearly $1.9 trillion. ... So they should be the last people to be talking about what is too expensive for the American people as we meet their needs."" But Pelosi’s talking point — that the GOP tax bill ""gave 83% of the benefits to the top 1%"" — is one that we have found fault with time and again over the past three years. An analysis of the final version of the tax bill by the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center found that by 2027, the tax bill would deliver 82.8% of its benefits to the top 1% of the income spectrum. However, in earlier years, the distribution of benefits looks very different. For instance, in 2018, according to the center’s analysis, the bill was projected to deliver 20.5% of the benefits to the top 1% — vastly less than the 83% figure that Pelosi cited. And as late as 2025, the center projected, 25.3% of the benefits would flow to the top 1%. The main reason: By 2027, a number of key tax provisions that benefit middle-income taxpayers will have expired unless Congress extends them. In addition, the new tax law changed how inflation was calculated, in a way that will be less generous to taxpayers as time goes on. ""How much of the benefit of the tax bill goes to the top 1% income group greatly depends on what year you are looking at,"" Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center, told PolitiFact in 2018. In an inquiry for this article, Pelosi’s office didn’t dispute our prior analysis but argued that the Republican focus on the wealthiest 1% can be seen in what parts of the tax cuts they chose to make permanent. ""Republicans chose to ensure that the permanent legacy of their tax bill would be benefits overwhelmingly flowing to the wealthiest 1% instead of working families,"" said Pelosi’s communications director, Henry V. Connelly. ""This is a defining feature of the legislation, because Republicans had a choice and decided to make other portions of the bill permanent but not those that would benefit working people instead of corporations and the wealthiest few."" Pelosi said the Republican tax bill passed in 2017 ""gave 83% of the benefits to the top 1%."" That’s the case in 2027, due to the expiration of several important middle-income tax cuts and a change in how inflation is calculated. However, through 2025, the share of benefits going to the top 1% is much smaller, at roughly 20% to 25%. Pelosi has cherry-picked by focusing on the tax bill’s impact by 2027, rather than the impact for the nearly a decade leading up to then.

Support for universal background checks on gun buyers is near 90%
","The day after the House passed legislation to expand background checks for gun sales, a lengthy Facebook questioned the popularity of the measure. The headline said: ""90% of Americans Do NOT Support Universal Background Checks — HR 8 The text underneath said: ""On Wednesday, California House Representative Mike Thompson claimed that 90% of Americans Support the universal background check gun control bill HR 8. I’m here to tell you today that this is not true. The Anti-Gun Lobby has been making this lie up for years."" The post is from Colion Noir, a gun rights advocate who has 1.41 million Facebook followers. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Thompson, the California Democrat who sponsored H.R. 8, has said it would require background checks for all gun sales and that ""we have 90% of the American people on our side."" The last time national polls were widely done on background checks was in 2019, when the House passed a similar bill. When Americans were asked if they support universal background checks, support was at or near 90%. We found only one national poll since 2019. It was taken online a few days before the House vote and showed 84% support.  H.R. 8 is the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021. It would prohibit gun transfers between private parties unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check. There would be some exceptions, such as gifts between immediate-family members.  ""Nothing in this Act, or any amendment made by this Act, shall be construed to authorize the establishment, directly or indirectly, of a national firearms registry,"" the bill says. The House passed the bill 227-203 on March 11 and sent it to the Senate. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine was the only Democrat to vote no; eight Republicans, including three from Florida, voted yes.  Colion Noir is an alias used by Texas lawyer Collins Iyare Idehen Jr. As a host on the National Rifle Association’s TV channel, he criticized students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., as being un-American when they led a protest march in Washington after a former student shot and killed 17 people at their school in 2018.  Noir argues in his post that a national gun registry would have to be established in order to enforce universal background checks, and that support for universal checks would not be 90% if a registry were required. But neither his post nor an accompanying video provides evidence to back up his claim. He did not reply to our email.  Gun sellers in all 50 states who are federal firearms licensees already use the National Instant Criminal Background Check System to verify that a gun buyer does not have a criminal record or is not otherwise ineligible to purchase or own a firearm. Universal checks would extend that to all gun purchases. The most recent poll that we found was conducted March 6-8, just before the House vote, by Morning Consult/Politico. Registered voters polled online were asked: ""To what extent do you support or oppose the following — requiring background checks for all gun purchasers?"" Those who said they strongly or somewhat support such a measure totaled 84%.  The pollsters asked a similar question in August 2019, and found 90% support. Other polls from 2019 found support for background checks in a similar range, from 83% to 93%, even with some variety in the phrasing of the question; in some cases, it mentioned Congress, pending legislation or the goal of reducing gun violence. Here’s a rundown: NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist   Dec. 9-11: ""Do you think each of the following is a good idea or a bad idea — background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales?"" Good idea: 87% (compared with 89% in July). Sept. 5-8: ""Do you think Congress should or should not pass legislation to require background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales?"" Should pass: 83%.  February: ""In order to reduce gun violence, do you think requiring background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales will make a difference or not make a difference?"" Make a difference: 82%. Washington Post-ABC News Sept. 2-5: ""Would you support or oppose requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers, including private sales and gun shows?"" Support: 89%. Pew Research Center Sept. 3-15: ""Please indicate whether you would favor or oppose the following proposals about gun policy — making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks."" Favor: 87%. Quinnipiac University Aug. 21-26: ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 93% (92% to 94% in three other polls between January and May.) September: ""As you may know, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill that would require background checks on all gun sales, including those at gun shows and through online retailers. Do you support or oppose this bill?"" Support: 83% (down from 86% in March). Suffolk University/USA Today Aug. 20-25: ""Do you support requiring background checks for all firearm sales?"" Support: 90%. Monmouth University Aug. 16-20: ""Do you support or oppose requiring comprehensive background checks for all gun purchasers, including private sales between two individuals?"" Support: 83%. NBC News/Wall Street Journal Aug. 10-14: ""I'm going to read you some actions that Congress might take related to guns. Would you strongly support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose expanding background checks to all firearm sales and transfers?"" Strongly or somewhat support: 89%. Fox News Aug. 11-13: ""Do you favor or oppose ...requiring criminal background checks on all gun buyers, including those buying at gun shows and private sales?"" Favor: 90%. Associated Press-National Opinion Research Center March 14-18: ""Do you favor, oppose, or neither favor nor oppose ... a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers, including private sales and gun shows?"" Favor: 83%.  Marquette Law School Poll director Charles Franklin said he hasn’t polled recently on background checks because his focus has been on the coronavirus pandemic and the 2020 election, and that’s likely true for other pollsters.  Kathleen Weldon, director of data operations and communications at the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University, said she was not surprised there hasn’t been much recent polling on background checks, because gun control has not been in the news.  ""I wouldn’t put too much weight on any single polling result,"" Weldon said of Morning Consult’s March 2021 poll. ""To be convinced there was any sort of meaningful drop in support in something where support has been in the high-80s or low-90s for a couple decades, I would definitely want to see more than one example."" Noir claimed in a Facebook post that ""90% of Americans do not support universal background checks."" This contradicts numerous polls that show the opposite: The best available evidence is that support for universal background checks is at or near 90%.

No, mRNA vaccines don't send the immune system into 'perpetual overdrive.'
","The innovative technology in a pair of COVID-19 vaccines continues to face attacks from misinformation on social media. One recent Facebook post inaccurately suggests the messenger RNA vaccines trick the immune system into making virus proteins nonstop, sending it into ""perpetual overdrive."" ""What happens when your body’s own cells are programmed to keep making the protein of an invader, nonstop, forever and ever, with no programmed end date?"" the post says. ""What happens when your immune system is in perpetual overdrive, tricked into believing there’s a pathogen that just never goes away?"" While the post doesn’t specify that it’s referring to Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines, it details the technology in those vaccines that instructs cells to make the protein of an invader. Comments on the post also show it’s understood that the claim is about those vaccines. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is a flawed understanding of how mRNA vaccines work in the body.  The mRNA shots do provide cells instructions to produce copies of the spike protein that surrounds the SARS-CoV-2 virus — so that it learns to recognize it and make antibodies against it — but it’s inaccurate to say that this happens ""over and over."" It doesn’t. Messenger RNA is relatively short-lived and degrades quickly, researchers and health officials say. After the protein piece is made, the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of them.  ""When you’re given the mRNA, it enters the cytoplasm of your cells and has the company of thousands of other copies of mRNA that are there to make proteins and enzymes to keep your cells alive and your body functioning,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee. ""This is just one more protein that degrades after a few days."" A Facebook post claims the mRNA vaccines send the immune system into ""perpetual overdrive"" and tricks it into making an invader’s protein forever. The COVID-19 vaccines that use mRNA technology do not instruct the body to make the virus’ spike proteins forever. The instructions are given at the time of vaccination and are broken down within days. We rate this False.",/factchecks/2021/mar/15/facebook-posts/no-mrna-vaccines-dont-send-immune-system-perpetual/

No, Fauci didn’t admit he’s not listening to COVID-19 science
","A Rumble post by conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza has spread widely on Facebook with this headline: ""Fauci admits he isn’t listening to the science when advocating policy."" But that doesn’t accurately describe the video clip in the post, which was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In the 1:20 minute clip of a March 10 CNN interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser on COVID-19, CNN anchor John Berman asked about the Biden administration’s pledge to ""make its decisions based on science."" ""What’s the science behind not saying it’s safe for people who have been vaccinated — received two doses — to travel?"" the reporter asked. Fauci responded that it was a good question and said ""the CDC is carefully heading in that direction."" He mentions the recent announcement made by Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can gather indoors without masks. ""That was the first in a multi-step process that they are going to be rolling out,"" Fauci said on CNN. ""They’re being careful, understandably. They want to get science, they want to get data, and then when you don’t have the data, and you don’t have the actual evidence, then you've got to make a judgment call. And I think that’s what you’re going to be seeing in the next weeks. You’re going to see little by little, more and more guidelines, getting people to be more and more flexible. The first installation of this is what can vaccinated people do in the home setting. Obviously the next one is going to be what you’re asking, what about travel, what about going out, what about getting a haircut, what about doing things like that. That’s all imminently going to be coming out."" The post’s headline implies that there is a scientific consensus and Fauci is deliberately ignoring it. But that’s not what Fauci said. Fauci talked about making a judgment call when there’s no science and data available to inform a policy position.  The Rumble post says as much in its single line of text beneath the video: ""During an interview on CNN Fauci said that when you don’t have the data you have to make a judgment call."" According to the CDC, fully vaccinated people shouldn’t travel if they can help it. Walensky said that because the vast majority of Americans are still unvaccinated the agency would wait to update its travel guidance until ""we have more protection across the communities and across the population."" While some experts have said they believe that guidance to be overly cautious, others say the caution is needed given the emergence of more contagious variants of the virus. But Fauci clearly didn’t say he was advocating for a policy in spite of scientific evidence, as the headline on this post states. We rate that claim False. ",/factchecks/2021/mar/15/facebook-posts/no-fauci-didnt-admit-hes-not-listening-covid-19-sc/

Tenure protects academic freedom, but faculty aren’t guaranteed a job
","A bill in the Iowa Legislature, House File 49, banning tenure at Iowa’s universities passed a House committee this session, clearing a key legislative March deadline colloquially called ""the funnel."" Proponents of the bill, like Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, say abolishing tenure — a contractual employment status that means faculty members have job security so controversial ideas can be exchanged to further knowledge without fear of punishment — will hold professors accountable for instances of free speech violations on campus. One such accused violation senators have cited involved an Iowa State University English professor, Chloe Clark, who wrote in an English course syllabus that students could not ""choose any topic that takes at its base that one side doesn’t deserve the same basic human rights as you do (ie: no arguments against gay marriage, abortion, Black Lives Matter, etc)."" She then apologized and updated the syllabus. ISU required each professor to include a statement of commitment to free expression at the start of the winter term. It’s worth noting that the professor in question wasn’t tenured. Clark graduated with an MFA in creative writing from ISU in 2016. Tenure-eligible professors at ISU undergo a seven-year probationary period before gaining tenure status. In fact, Clark is an assistant teaching professor, which is a term/non-tenure-eligible appointment, ISU spokesperson Angie Hunt wrote in an email to The Daily Iowan. She’s continuing to teach this semester. Holt was quoted by The Gazette of Cedar Rapids as saying, ""I wonder if the assault on free speech by some university professors is not related to the belief that they’re Teflon-coated and indestructible and, therefore, maybe we need to look at getting rid of tenure."" In an email to the DI, Holt cited ""the growing number of cases in which professors who know better threaten and intimidate students with differing viewpoints."" He referenced the ISU professor and another instance of the dean of the College of Dentistry calling in a student who ""replied all"" to an email to expressed his disagreement with the college’s stance on a Trump executive order relating to diversity, equity, and inclusion training. Holt previously told the DI, ""The (House) Oversight Committee has had a number of students reach out to us and describe stories of what they’ve been through and how intimidated they feel."" This isn’t a unique view of tenure, which Republicans in other states have criticized and in Iowa have been trying to eliminate since 2017. In a January interview with WHO radio, state Sen. Brad Zaun, R-Urbandale, said he didn’t think ""anyone in our universities should be guaranteed a job."" But are tenured professors at Iowa’s public universities — the University of Iowa, Iowa State University, and the University of Northern Iowa — guaranteed a job? Professors with tenure have certain protections in order to preserve academic freedom but, steps exist to remove them. Plus, many faculty members do not have tenure and, thus, have fewer protections against being removed. And, there is this: Tenure grants professors protection for free speech. At ISU, the handbook says that tenured faculty must not be disciplined ""based upon any belief, expression, or conduct protected by law or by the principles of academic freedom."" But tenure’s protections are not all-encompassing. ""I want to make it really clear: Tenure is not a lifetime appointment for any given faculty member,"" Rachel Boon, chief academic officer for the state Board of Regents told lawmakers in February. ""Tenure is an employment agreement we have with them."" At each state university, tenured faculty members are reviewed annually, with a more extensive peer and department head review every five to seven years, depending on the institution. Professors on the track to become tenured undergo a probationary period that generally lasts six years with reviews by ""expert peers outside the institution,"" according to the state Board of Regents’ 2020 tenure report, and internally at the college and university levels. The report states: ""Termination occurs when the tenured faculty member does not meet employment obligations, or in cases of program termination or financial exigency for the institution."" Sen. Jim Carlin, R-Sioux City, questioned whether tenured professors are held accountable or undergo reviews on March 8 as the Senate passed a bill that would prohibit certain types of diversity, equity, and inclusion training at public education institutions, while requiring teachers and faculty members to undergo First Amendment training. Carlin said he submitted to the regents a request for the last five years of disciplinary actions brought against tenured faculty members at each of the three public universities, but hadn’t yet received an answer as of March 8. ""They wouldn’t reveal the disposition of those disciplinary actions because it would show whether or not we have an authentic review process,"" he said on the Senate floor March 8. In response to a request from the DI, regents spokesperson Josh Lehman provided the DI with documents returned to Carlin in response to his questions. Lehman said regents staff sent Carlin the same information March 11, the same day Lehman sent it to the DI. In an interview March 12, Carlin said he hadn’t yet received the materials, but after reviewing the documents over the weekend, he said the data ""lacked any meaningful specificity with regard to the nature of the disciplinary actions or dispositions except for those which resulted in a discharge or resignation."" He said he’d asked the secretary of the Senate to follow up with another request to the regents for more detailed information. Carlin said he’s not opposed to tenure, nor does he have an axe to grind with the regent institutions or professors. Instead, he said he wants to ensure that the regent institutions instill a culture of allowing students to speak their minds and challenge assumptions. ""We don’t want them to be places of indoctrination,"" Carlin said. ""We want our students at our regents institutions to be able to think critically about how things are."" He said he’d heard of a number of students who decided against expressing their true opinions for fear of a lower grade but hadn’t experienced explicit speech suppression. When asked whether changing tenure review policies could elicit a more fearful culture among professors, Carlin said: ""I don’t think professors have anything to fear."" Each of the three public universities has had a handful of instances where tenured professors or faculty applying for tenure separated from the universities or were denied tenure status because of performance, according to the information provided. About five tenured faculty over the past 10 years have separated from the UI as the result of the entire procedure to achieve or retain tenure status, but others have resigned at earlier points in the six-to-seven-year process to attain tenure, the documents stated. Once tenured, faculty members at the UI are reviewed annually by their department executive officer with a more extensive peer-review every five years, according to the university’s faculty review procedures. For peer review, colleges generally require that senior faculty members evaluate classroom teaching and review written and electronic course materials. Student evaluations also factor into administrator decisions on promotion and tenure, according to the 2020 regents’ report. The UI has 1,156 tenured faculty members and 329 tenure-track faculty members. Tenured and tenure-track faculty comprise 43 percent of total faculty members. At ISU, faculty undergo a rigorous review every six years. Tenured faculty members can be dismissed but ""only for adequate cause, elimination of academic programs, or financial exigency,"" according to Iowa State’s faculty handbook. According to documents provided to the DI by Lehman, after five promotion and tenure cycles, tenure was denied to about 7 percent of faculty who applied for tenure as an associate professor (13 out of 188 applicants), the regents’ staff wrote. According to the documents, a similar or larger share of pre-tenure faculty leave the university before the tenure review ""based on feedback or their own assessment of the likelihood of success at the promotion and tenure decision point."" Faculty applying for tenure undergo a seven-year probationary period before they can be approved for tenure status. ISU has 966 tenured faculty. That is 68.5 percent of the faculty. Another 343 are on track for tenure, the university reported. Tenured faculty at ISU also are also reviewed every year using a Position Responsibility Statement, which outlines a faculty member’s role and goals. ISU does a more comprehensive peer evaluation either once every seven years, at the request of the faculty, or the year following two unsatisfactory reviews. In the case of an unsatisfactory annual evaluation, the handbook states, the department chair and the faculty member under review must create an action plan for improved performance. At UNI, the 373 tenured and 110 faculty members on track for tenure represent 69 percent of the faculty. UNI has 214 faculty members who do not have tenure. UNI’s tenured faculty are reviewed annually by their department head, relying in part on student and faculty assessments, according to the regents’ tenure report. For the first time this year, UNI implemented a review of professional performance on a six-year rotation, the report notes. According to documents provided by Lehman, the UNI has terminated a tenured professor ""for teaching performance issues"" and others have resigned ""due to issues of cause being determined."" Carlin also asked a regent lobbyist Keith Saunders for disciplinary actions leveled against faculty other than termination in the last five years. At the UI, six tenured faculty faced disciplinary action other than termination during that time period. Iowa State recorded 13 and UNI reported two tenured faculty facing consequences during the last five years. Regents staff also recorded the number of faculty on track for tenure, clinical, research, or instruction, and fixed term faculty that underwent discipline in the last five years. Those tallies were nine at the UI, two at ISU, and none at UNI. Tenure is a contractual agreement that protects professors’ abilities to teach, research, and challenge assumptions without fear of termination based on a belief or expression. However, tenured faculty members are reviewed for performance, and undergo a rigorous, years-long process to apply for tenure. Faculty handbooks show that tenured faculty members can be dismissed for performance or financial reasons even if they have tenure and that they must undergo annual performance reviews. Further documents provided by the Board of Regents show that faculty have faced disciplinary action by their respective universities. Holt wrote in an email to The Daily Iowan that he was offering an opinion, based on reports he hears about the conduct some faculty have used to, in his words, silence students. He said he did not state his opinion about faculty feeling protected as fact and that his opinion cannot be proved either way. However, the statement is based on what many who want to curb what they see as faculty abuses as being fact. Moreover, the statement reads as being fact, or at least based on fact. That is why we rate the statement that faculty members are guaranteed a job as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/mar/15/iowa-gop-state-legislators/tenure-protects-academic-freedom-faculty-arent-gua/
