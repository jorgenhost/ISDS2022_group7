Viral Facebook post says Barack Obama has lowest spending record of any recent president
","EDITOR'S NOTE: This item prompted a large volume and feedback and comments. We published an article about the comments on May 25 and an update to this item on May 31. You'll find the update below, at the end of the fact-check. On May 22, 2012, Rex Nutting, the international commentary editor for the financial website MarketWatch, published a column titled, ""Obama spending binge never happened."" Nutting’s column explored data on federal spending patterns during recent presidencies, concluding that -- contrary to the tax-and-spend stereotype of Democrats -- President Barack Obama has actually presided over the smallest increases in federal spending of any recent president.

The column went viral. Within hours, people who liked the column were posting a graphic on Facebook that paired a line from Nutting’s column with a quote from Mitt Romney’s campaign website.

Under the heading, ""Romney’s World,"" the Facebook post quoted a Romney Web page saying, ""Since President Obama assumed office three years ago, federal spending has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history."" (That accurately quotes Romney.)

Immediately to the right, under the heading, ""Real World,"" the Facebook post provided a retort using a caption from Nutting’s key chart: ""Government spending under Obama, including his signature stimulus bill, is rising at a 1.4 percent annualized pace — slower than at any time in nearly 60 years."" (The post cited the quotation to the Wall Street Journal; technically, Nutting writes for MarketWatch, which is an affiliate of the Wall Street Journal.)

The Facebook post appears to have originated with the liberal blog Groobiecat Call, which promises ""data-driven analysis"" and ""lefteous indignation."" Before the day was out, roughly a dozen PolitiFact readers had forwarded it to us, seeking our view of its accuracy. So we looked into it.

Nutting’s column

First, let’s recap what Nutting said in his column:

""Almost everyone believes that Obama has presided over a massive increase in federal spending, an ‘inferno’ of spending that threatens our jobs, our businesses and our children’s future. Even Democrats seem to think it’s true. But it didn’t happen. Although there was a big stimulus bill under Obama, federal spending is rising at the slowest pace since Dwight Eisenhower brought the Korean War to an end in the 1950s.""

Nutting ran the numbers for the past 60 years, adjusting for the fact that ""the first year of every presidential term starts with a budget approved by the previous administration and Congress."" For Obama, that means that ""the 2009 fiscal year, which Republicans count as part of Obama’s legacy, began four months before Obama moved into the White House. The major spending decisions in the 2009 fiscal year were made by George W. Bush and the previous Congress.""

He continued, ""By no means did Obama try to reverse that spending. Indeed, his budget proposals called for even more spending in subsequent years. But the Congress (mostly Republicans but many Democrats, too) stopped him. If Obama had been a king who could impose his will, perhaps what the Republicans are saying about an Obama spending binge would be accurate.""

Nutting did, however, attribute a portion of fiscal 2009 spending to Obama rather than Bush. He reassigned about $140 billion, covering spending made that year through the stimulus bill, the expansion of a children’s health-care program and other appropriations bills passed in the spring of 2009.

""If we attribute that $140 billion in stimulus to Obama and not to Bush,"" Nutting wrote, ""we find that spending under Obama grew by about $200 billion over four years, amounting to a 1.4 percent annualized increase.""

Our analysis

Before presenting our own calculations, we’ll get some methodological issues out of the way.

Like Nutting, we used historical data from the Office of Management and Budget along with projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Projecting outlays into the future involves a degree of uncertainty, but CBO’s most recent projections are considered the most independent and reliable.

Because we’re checking the Facebook post rather than Nutting’s column, we examined the way the post compared the presidents. Since the Facebook post ignores differences between presidents’ first and second terms, which are noted in Nutting’s chart, we’ve combined presidents’ entire tenures into a single time span. And several presidents who served during the past 60 years didn’t have tenures that coincided precisely with fiscal years, due to assassination or resignation. So we’re using the closest fiscal years we can, and we’re skipping President Gerald Ford, whose tenure was too short to adequately measure.

Here are the average spending increases per year in raw dollars (not adjusted for inflation) in descending order by president: President Fiscal year baseline Last fiscal year Average percentage increase per year   So, using raw dollars, Obama did oversee the lowest annual increases in spending of any president in 60 years.

Here are the results using inflation-adjusted figures:   President Fiscal year baseline Last fiscal year Average percentage increase per year   So, using inflation-adjusted dollars, Obama had the second-lowest increase -- in fact, he actually presided over a decrease once inflation is taken into account.

Bottom line: The Facebook post’s claim that government spending under Obama is ""slower than at any time in nearly 60 years"" is very close to accurate.

Explaining the results

So why the disconnect between Obama’s image as a big spender and the reality of how much federal spending has actually grown?

First, Obama’s record on debt is a lot less flattering than is his record on federal government spending. During the same time that spending is poised to be increasing by 1.4 percent per year under Obama, the debt will be increasing by 14.6 percent per year. The reason? Year by year, federal revenues haven’t been keeping up with spending, due to the struggling national economy (which has held back tax revenues) and a continuation of tax cuts. And each year there’s an annual deficit, the national debt grows.

Second, federal spending under Obama is higher as a share of gross domestic product than it has been in most of the previous 60 years. That, too is because of the economy, which has simultaneously slowed the growth of GDP and boosted government spending for programs such as food stamps and Medicaid.

Third, the aging of the baby boomers has driven a rise in entitlement spending that is masking cuts Obama and the GOP Congress have made, and have promised to make, in discretionary spending. Using outlays as the unit of measurement, as Nutting and the Facebook post have done, means focusing on money already spent. It does not take into account future spending that’s been committed to but not yet carried out.

And finally, many Americans associate Obama with the high-profile legislative activities of his first year or two, when initiatives such as the stimulus sent spending upward the fastest. Since then, spending has slowed, thanks in part to spending cuts pushed by congressional Republicans.

Which brings us to another important issue: The president is not all-powerful, so his record on spending was accomplished in collaboration with congressional Republicans.

Our ruling

The Facebook post says Mitt Romney is wrong to claim that spending under Obama has ""accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history,"" because it's actually risen ""slower than at any time in nearly 60 years.""

Obama has indeed presided over the slowest growth in spending of any president using raw dollars, and it was the second-slowest if you adjust for inflation. The math simultaneously backs up Nutting’s calculations and demolishes Romney’s contention. The only significant shortcoming of the graphic is that it fails to note that some of the restraint in spending was fueled by demands from congressional Republicans. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True. UPDATE, May 31, 2012 While we have already shared some of the critiques of this fact-check in a previous follow-up story, critics have since noted that two of our fellow fact checkers -- the Washington Post Fact Checker and the Associated Press -- offered more negative rulings on related claims. The Fact Checker addressed the apparent discrepancy succinctly in a follow-up column, saying ""we did not evaluate the same thing."" There’s a widespread misconception that we gave a Mostly True rating to Rex Nutting’s MarketWatch column. After our original fact-check published, White House spokesman Jay Carney tweeted, ""PolitiFact backs MarketWatch analysis of federal spending under POTUS & predecessors."" Many conservative bloggers read our fact-check the same way, as they attacked us. The assumption made by both sides is wrong. We examined at a Facebook post that said Mitt Romney is wrong to claim that spending under Obama has ""accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history,"" because it's actually risen ""slower than at any time in nearly 60 years."" The Facebook post does rely partly on Nutting’s work, and our item addresses that, but we did not simply give our seal of approval to everything Nutting wrote. In fact, half of the Facebook post stems from something else entirely -- a claim on Mitt Romney’s website. Using and slightly tweaking Nutting’s methodology, we recalculated spending increases under each president back to Dwight Eisenhower and produced tables ranking the presidents from highest spenders to lowest spenders. By contrast, both the Fact Checker and the AP zeroed in on one narrower (and admittedly crucial) data point -- how to divide the responsibility between George W. Bush and Obama for the spending that occurred in fiscal year 2009, when spending rose fastest. How you divide the spending between Bush and Obama for fiscal 2009 only makes a difference to our ruling if the shifts move Obama significantly up or down our rankings. Do they? Nutting attributed spending from the first year of every presidential term to the previous administration, arguing that every new president starts their term four months into a fiscal year begun under their predecessor. Historically, this has not been a particularly controversial approach, and even some of Nutting’s critics we spoke to agreed that it’s not a bad rule of thumb. But fiscal year 2009 was special because it came amid an economic and financial free fall that drove the nation’s leaders to spend a lot more than they ordinarily would. Nutting did take these factors into account, but not to the extent that some critics think is needed. Nutting shifted $140 billion in fiscal 2009 spending from two of Obama’s signature programs -- the economic stimulus package and an expansion of the Children’s Health Insurance Program -- out of Bush’s column and into Obama’s. He also shifted excess spending beyond what Bush would have spent from the appropriations bills signed by Obama in 2009. A number of critics also argued that spending for the Troubled Asset Relief Program should be taken into account. This program aided troubled financial institutions and involved a lot of money going out the door in fiscal 2009 and a lot of money coming in the door in subsequent years as the money was paid back to the treasury. The critics note that counting the TARP expenses as Bush’s artificially raises the baseline level of spending Obama inherited, thereby making Obama’s subsequent spending increases seem unrealistically small. We think reasonable people can disagree on which president should be responsible for TARP spending, but to give the critics their say, we’ll include it in our alternative calculation. So, combining the fiscal 2009 costs for programs that are either clearly or arguably Obama’s -- the stimulus, the CHIP expansion, the incremental increase in appropriations over Bush’s level and TARP -- produces a shift from Bush to Obama of between $307 billion and $456 billion, based on the most reasonable estimates we’ve seen critics offer. That’s quite a bit larger than Nutting’s $140 billion, but by our calculations, it would only raise Obama’s average annual spending increase from 1.4 percent to somewhere between 3.4 percent and 4.9 percent. That would place Obama either second from the bottom or third from the bottom out of the 10 presidents we rated, rather than last. When we encounter a compound claim such as this one, we consider the accuracy of each part separately. During our internal discussions, we give a preliminary rating to each half of a claim, then average them to produce our final, published rating. Our extensive consultations with budget analysts since our item was published convinces us that there’s no single ""correct"" way to divvy up fiscal 2009 spending, only a variety of plausible calculations. So the second portion of the Facebook claim -- that Obama’s spending has risen ""slower than at any time in nearly 60 years"" -- strikes us as Half True. Meanwhile, we would’ve given a True rating to the Facebook claim that Romney is wrong to say that spending under Obama has ""accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history."" Even using the higher of the alternative measurements, at least seven presidents had a higher average annual increases in spending. That balances out to our final rating of Mostly True.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Texas', 'Gilberto Hinojosa']","
UPDATED: Gilberto Hinojosa says “large majority” of Republicans believe Obama is foreign-born and a Muslim
","
Seeking support in his bid to chair the Texas Democratic Party, Gilberto Hinojosa recently opened an Austin speech by tackling Republicans’ criticism of the president.

""A large majority of the Republican Party believes that this man is a Muslim and was born in a foreign country, was not born in the United States,"" he said at the Central Texas Democratic Forum on April 24, 2012.

Are those views really commonplace in the GOP more than three years into Obama’s presidency?

PolitiFact has debunked claims that Obama follows or formerly followed the Islamic faith. Even so, in August 2010 we wrote that 18 percent of Americans believed he was a Muslim, up from 11 percent in March 2009, according to Pew Research Center data. A Time poll also released in 2010 claimed the number was 24 percent.

Often linked is the belief that Obama was not born in the United States. Here, too, PolitiFact has debunked numerous related claims, many involving the president’s birth certificate.

We asked Hinojosa, a lawyer and former Cameron County judge, for backup on his claim about the ""large majority"" of Republicans. He said he’d seen ""numerous publications and blogs where that fact is mentioned."" He provided no documentation.

Americans have indeed been polled many times on these questions, sometimes in conjunction with news items such as plans for a mosque near the site of 9/11’s terrorist attacks in New York (a big topic in August 2010); Obama releasing his long-form Hawaii birth certificate (April 27, 2011) and the killing of Osama bin Laden (May 2, 2011).

A two-state poll touched off headlines in March 2012, the month before Hinojosa’s remark. Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-oriented firm, found that among residents who said they planned to vote in their upcoming GOP primary, 52 percent in Alabama and 42 percent in Mississippi said they believed Obama was a Muslim.

That ""Southern Swing"" poll got a lot of press and social media reaction -- more so than the same pollsters’ March 2012 results from Obama’s home state of Illinois, in which 39 percent of likely GOP primary voters said he was Muslim and 36 percent said he was foreign-born.

Then again, the ""Southern Swing"" ran about 48 states shy of the whole country, and only counted a subset of Republicans.

We found eight national polls, from March 2009 through May 2011, that asked these questions and broke down results by respondents’ political affiliation.

Several pollsters cautioned against a too-literal reading of their results, noting a polling phenomenon that ABC News described in an Aug. 30, 2010, blog post: ""Some people who strongly oppose a person or proposition will take virtually any opportunity to express that antipathy. Offer a negative attribute, they’ll grab it.""

We’ve posted details from these polls in chart form online. In this story, for simplicity’s sake, we’ll showcase the highest and lowest percentage of responses for each of the two questions.

On Obama’s religion, the biggest percentage of Republicans answering ""Muslim"" was 46 percent in an August 2010 Time poll. The lowest was 17 percent in a March 2009 Pew Research Center for People & the Press poll.

On Obama being born outside the country, the highest result was 43 percent of Republicans in an April 2011 USA Today/Gallup poll. The lowest was 14 percent in an April-May 2011 Washington Post poll.

So, a ""large majority"" of Republicans did not endorse either of these answers.

Still, there is another definition of ""majority"" that could be applied: ""the greatest share,"" as in the type of election where the candidate with the most votes wins. And in three of the polls, ""Muslim"" and ""foreign born"" were the answers most often given by Republicans.

In the Time poll, that 46 percent who answered ""Muslim"" is nearly double the Republicans giving the next-most popular answer (24 percent who said ""Christian""). In the USA Today/Gallup poll, 43 percent is one-and-three-quarter times as much as the 25 percent who answered ""definitely"" or ""probably"" born in the U.S. In contrast, a February-March 2011 Pew poll on birthplace was more evenly split, with the 37 percent of Republicans who answered that Obama was born in ""another country"" edging out the 33 percent who said ""United States"" and 30 percent who said they didn’t know or declined to answer.

Hinojosa didn’t respond when we shared these poll results.

Our ruling

National polls consistently show less than half -- sometimes much less than half -- of Republicans saying Obama is a Muslim or born abroad, though both falsehoods have sometimes been the No. 1 Republican responses.

Regardless, there is no indication that a ""large majority"" of Republicans believe Obama is a Muslim or that he was born abroad. Hinojosa’s statement rates False. 
UPDATE, 12:33 p.m., May 31, 2012: After we published this article, a reader pointed out we’d missed a March 2010 Harris Interactive poll indicating 57 percent of Republicans believed Obama to be a Muslim. After reviewing the poll, and weighing critiques of its methodology and wording, we left this story and the statement’s False rating unchanged.

Justin Hewlett says the majority of district's congressional candidates do not live in district
","
Justin Hewlett, among a dozen Republicans seeking to represent a new tornado-shaped U.S. House district running north toward Fort Worth from western Hays and Travis counties, points out in a recent mailer that members of Congress are not required to live in the districts they represent.

The Constitution holds that House members must be residents of the state -- not the district -- they represent. So it’s legal, say, for a member representing Central Texas to live in El Paso or Port Arthur or Brownsville, though we cannot recall such a farflung turn.

Hewlett’s mailer continues: ""In fact, the majority of the (Congressional) District 25 candidates reside outside of the district.""

We were curious if Hewlett was right that at least seven of the GOP aspirants do not live in the district, which brings together parts or all of 13 counties including Burnet, Lampasas, Bosque, Hill and (smidges of) Tarrant and Bell counties. The sole Democratic candidate, Elaine Henderson, lives near Austin in Lago Vista, which is in the district.

Hewlett -- the mayor of Cleburne, in Johnson County, which is in the district -- told us in a telephone interview that he checked each opponent’s filings with the Federal Election Commission and researched home addresses online.

By email, he passed along his breakdown indicating that five candidates do not live in the district, while three candidates might have moved in after declaring their candidacies. According to Hewlett’s breakdown, candidate Ernie Beltz Jr. lives in Cedar Park, not in the district; Bill Burch lives in Grand Prairie, not in the district; Dianne Costa lives in Lewisville, not in the district; Michael Williams has an Arlington home and an Austin apartment, both not in the district; and James Dillon lists his hometown as Liberty Hill, not in the district.

Wes Riddle lives in Belton, Hewlett told us, just outside the district. Hewlett wrote: ""Since taking some ‘heat’ about not living in the district, (Riddle) bought a property"" in Gatesville, in the district, and changed his voter registration to that address.

Dave Garrison, Hewlett said, has listed an address in Horseshoe Bay, just outside the district, but claims to have an apartment in Bee Cave, near Austin, in the district. ""If this is true, it is likely that he has changed his voter registration to the apartment in Bee Cave,"" Hewlett told us.

Finally, Hewlett wrote, Roger Williams is from Weatherford, outside the district, but when he declared his candidacy he said he and his wife would buy an Austin home. ""He is now claiming they own a house in Austin,"" Hewlett said. ""If this is true, it is likely that he has now changed his residence to Austin.""

The unmentioned Republican candidates in his analysis are Chad Wilbanks of Austin; Brian Mathews of Austin; and Charlie Holcomb of Wimberley, all presumably living in the district.

Separately, Wilbanks pointed out a news article on the candidates in the March 17, 2012, Killeen Daily Herald stating that six candidates, or half, live within its boundaries and six -- Beltz, Burch, Costa, Dillon and Michael and Roger Williams -- do not.

To launch our own check, we asked the election commission if it tracks where House candidates live. A commission spokesman, Christian Hilland, advised by email that the agency is not required to collect home addresses of House candidates; most addresses on file are for candidate postal boxes or campaign headquarters.

Next, we played Dial-A-Candidate, focusing on candidates listed as non-residents in the Herald story plus those whose residency is questioned by Hewlett.  We then confirmed three candidates as non-residents, while four said they indeed live, and vote, in the district. Dillon, listed as living in Liberty Hill, outside the district, declined to discuss his residency.

Details:

--Burch told us he lives in Grand Prairie, outside the district, though hopes to move into the district before November 2012. 
--Beltz confirmed that he lives in Cedar Park, about two miles outside the district.

--Costa said she lives outside the district in Denton County’s Highland Village, though her family has a 230-acre ranch in Hamilton County, which is in the district. ""I pay taxes in the district. I have an investment in the district,"" Costa said.

--Michael Williams’ campaign manager, Will Fullerton, told us that Williams got an apartment in the Austin part of the district after the race started and registered to vote there. Vanessa Shaw of the Travis County Tax Office separately told us by phone that Williams registered to vote in the county in early 2012.

--Rachel Nolen of Riddle’s campaign said the candidate has offices in Belton and Austin, but lives in Gatesville, which is in Coryell County and the district. Peggy Vaden of the Coryell County Tax Office later told us by phone that Riddle registered to vote there in August 2011 and has since voted there twice.

--Steve Ray, a consultant to Garrison’s campaign, said that while Garrison has a Horseshoe Bay house just outside the district, he has lived and voted in Bee Cave, near Austin and in the district, since at least last fall. Shaw, of the Travis County office, said Garrison registered to vote in the county in September 2011.

--Roger Williams moved into a West Austin apartment in the district on March 16, 2012, his campaign spokesman, Kasey Pipes, told us by email. Asked about Williams’ Weatherford home, Pipes replied: ""He’s keeping two residences, but his primary residence will be in Austin."" Shaw told us Williams’ registration to vote in the county took effect in May 2012.

Our ruling

Our conclusion is that four of the 12 Republican candidates -- not the majority, as Hewlett says -- live (and vote) outside the district. Still, some hopefuls lived outside the district until not long ago, giving Hewlett’s claim an element of truth. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/may/23/justin-hewlett/justin-hewlett-says-majority-districts-congression/
"['Georgia', 'Transportation', 'John Kennedy']","
Airport spokesman says new international terminal ""within budget""
","
The Maynard H. Jackson Jr. International Terminal at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport finally opened its doors after more than a decade of delays, lawsuits and changes of plans.

Local leaders are celebrating the hard-fought victory by patting each other -- and themselves -- on the back.

Atlanta Department of Aviation spokesman John Kennedy touted the city’s accomplishment during an interview with radio host Scott Slade on AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB

""John, a lot of people have been waiting a long time to get the Maynard H. Jackson International Terminal open. Are we on time to get it open on Wednesday?"" Slade asked.

""Yes indeed. It will open on time and within budget on Wednesday, May 16, and we are excited, too,"" Kennedy said.

Sure it opened Wednesday. But on budget? Even with all the delays?

Other officials have made similar claims. We asked Kennedy for proof.

PolitiFact Georgia also burrowed deep into The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s archives, where we uncovered a tale of dreams deferred and plans gone awry.  
Planning for the international terminal began in earnest more than a decade ago. Leaders envisioned a crescent-shaped terminal that would double the size of the international complex to 3 million square feet. 
The goal was to keep Hartsfield-Jackson competitive and improve its design. International passengers complained that they had to claim their baggage, carry it through U.S. Customs, recheck it and pick it up again. The trek covered more than a mile. 
Stories printed in November 2000 pegged the cost at $719 million, including additional parking, a taxiway and road upgrades. Leaders said it could be finished as early as 2004. 
Then things got complicated. Construction prices rose, and after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, so did the cost of security measures. Delta Air Lines went into bankruptcy, and leaders wondered whether the airport needed a new international terminal at all. 
The airport’s original design team was fired because the then-general manager of the airport, Ben DeCosta, said its plans would break the proposed $700 million budget. The team sued the city for $60 million. 
A yearlong audit that ended in May 2006 concluded that at an estimated cost of $1 billion, the international terminal was over budget. 
  
That number was low. 
In June 2007, the AJC obtained a copy of an internal briefing that showed that delays, design changes and rising construction costs could push the price tag as high as $1.5 billion. It would also be 400,000 square feet smaller than originally planned. 
At the time, airport officials also downplayed the $1.5 billion as a ""preliminary"" figure and said no final budget figure had been approved. But five months later, DeCosta confirmed to the Atlanta City Council that the number was well-researched and accurate. 
""The number has a lot of information behind it,"" DeCosta said, according to an AJC story Nov. 2007. ""There are things that could push it higher, but this is close."" 
DeCosta also downplayed significance of the earlier $700 million budget figure. Its purpose was to establish what share of construction costs the airlines would pay, he said. 
""They weren’t original cost estimates,"" DeCosta said. ""There was no design at that point. They were just budget numbers."" 
Regardless, the airport’s biggest airline, Delta, grew concerned. It is helping to pay for the new terminal, and by 2009, it worried that the ballooning price might double the airline's costs to board passengers at its main hub.

The airline wanted the terminal’s costs trimmed by $400 million, the AJC reported.  
The latest tally: About $1.4 billion, just about what the 2007 internal briefing foretold. Final numbers will be available later in the year.   
This is nearly twice the $700 million floated 10 years ago. How does this count as ""within budget""? 
Kennedy said he was talking about the formal budget, not the numbers from a decade ago. He sent us a budget document from May 13 of this year that placed the formal budget at $1.413 billion. 
The latest projected cost was $1.403 billion, which would mean that the terminal was about $10 million under budget. He noted that other city officials have used this number before. 
So what was that $700 million about? It wasn't a budget, Kennedy told PolitiFact Georgia in an email. It was a ""preliminary concept estimate."" 
""The $700 million ... was never a budgeted number -- it was merely a preliminary concept estimate made in the late 1990s for a proposed, future east side international terminal which, together with several other major airport projects, eventually became part the Airport's Master Plan of 2000,"" he wrote. ""There were never any detailed planning or design documents produced for this concept."" 
The Atlanta City Council and airlines did not formally approve a budget for the international terminal until March 2008, Kennedy said. By then, the design and other planning were complete. 
Kennedy added that the original $700 million figure was not up for discussion during the radio interview, and to take that figure into account in this story would be to take his comment out of context. 
This explanation made us groan. 
The distinction between a ""preliminary concept estimate"" and a ""budgeted number"" is important to technocrats. But when top leaders say in public that they expect an airport terminal to cost $700 million, taxpayers expect it to cost $700 million. 
Furthermore, the $700 million figure was crucial to the very people who planned the terminal. Former airport head DeCosta fired the airport's first design team, and Delta balked at backing the project when costs threatened to rise above this mark. 
Kennedy's claim that the airport terminal is ""within budget"" goes down in flames.

R.I. congressional candidate Brendan Doherty says federal government has paid $601 million in five years to dead retirees
","
Brendan Doherty, like a lot of candidates, says if he’s elected to Congress in November he’ll put a stop to ""rampant fraud and waste"" in government spending.

On his campaign website, the Republican candidate for the First District seat and former head of the Rhode Island State Police, says he’ll use his years in law enforcement  to ""shine a light on the unconscionable abuse of hard-earned taxpayer funds.""

Among examples of abuse he lists are the purported millions of dollars in pension benefits the federal government distributes each year to federal retirees who are, well, dead:

""Over the past five years the federal government has paid out $601 million in retirement and disability benefits to deceased former federal employees.""

We’ve heard stories of dead people voting before, but are they also getting hundreds of millions in pension payments? We called Doherty’s campaign to find out where the candidate got his information.

Spokesman Robert Coupe told us he thought the $601 million figure was pretty large when he first heard it from campaign staffers. He said it came from ""Wastebook 2011,"" the latest edition of an annual compilation of questionable government spending put out by Sen. Tom A. Coburn, R-Oklahoma.

We checked ""Wastebook 2011,"" which indeed mentions ""over $601 million"" paid out to deceased federal workers in the last five years, with footnotes citing the source: a report issued by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management’s Office of the Inspector General, titled, appropriately enough, ""Stopping Improper Payments to Deceased Annuitants.""

According to the Office of Personnel Management’s report, ""the amount of post-death improper payments is consistently $100-$150 million annually.""

Some of what the federal government calls ""improper payments"" is outright fraud -- people with electronic access to the deceased’s bank accounts taking the money. And some of it is because the money was electronically transferred into what are now inactive bank accounts. The money can sit there piling up for years before anyone notices.

Special efforts have been under way since at least 2005 to reduce payments going to dead retirees and their survivors, the report says. Those efforts have included matching the rolls of eligible recipients with the Social Security Administration’s death records on a weekly and annual basis, doing similar checks with the IRS to see who’s still filing returns, and random phone calls to retirees over 90 years old just to make sure they’re still around.

Those steps have helped identify the scope of the problem, Susan L. Ruge, a spokeswoman in the Office of Personnel Management’s inspector general’s office, said in an e-mail. In fiscal year 2010, for instance, the office identified $116.8 million in improper payments going to dead retirees or survivors.

But solving the problem is another matter.

According to the Personnel Management’s report: ""There remains a high probability that egregious loss of monies from the [civil service] fund will continue and require strategic corrective actions.""  It notes one case of a man illegally pocketing more than $515,000 by cashing in his dead father’s monthly retirement checks -- for 37 years.

Ruge said 94 percent of annuity payments are transferred electronically into bank accounts as opposed to the older method of mailing checks. The office of inspector general, she said, has no breakdown as to payments stolen by others with access to those accounts and money lost by languishing into those unattended accounts.

""In overpayment cases where no theft has occurred, there is greater potential for EFT (electronic fund transfer) overpayments to continue undetected, simply because no one is monitoring the deceased annuitant’s bank account,"" said Ruge.

If there is good news in any of this it is this: while $601 million going to dead people in the last five years sounds like a lot of money, it represents less than 2.5 percent of all civil service retirement disbursements, the report claims.

Our Ruling

Doherty’s website says ""Over the past five years the federal government has paid out $601 million in retirement and disability benefits to deceased former federal employees.""

The campaign accurately quoted a figure whose source is a report issued by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management’s Office of the Inspector General.

We rate his statement True.

Rhode Island’s former top cop is setting his bar of expectation pretty high if he’s promising to curb this kind of  ""rampant fraud and waste."" We’ll be watching.

Romney says debt plus unfunded liabilities equals $520,000 per household
","
When Mitt Romney traveled around the country campaigning recently, he brought a debt clock with him showing the rising national debt.

The total is a mind-boggling, massive number. In St. Petersburg, Fla., on May 16, 2012, Romney explained what the debt and ""unfunded liabilities"" means for every household.

Romney said unfunded liabilities ""means promises made by the federal government where there is no money behind it to pay it. … So it's the liabilities (that) add up to, think about this, $520,000 per household. …And this president hasn’t stopped it; he has added to it.""

Wow -- every family owes more than a half-million? Forget about ever paying that off -- right?

We wanted to check if Romney, the presumed Republican nominee for president, was correct that the amount of debt plus unfunded liabilities equals about $520,000 per household.

We’re not going to consider responsibility for the debt in this report; both Republicans and Democrats have been responsible over the years. Here, we want to look at whether the number is an accurate reflection of how much debt we have.

Romney’s explanation

The Romney campaign pointed us to a 2011 news analysis in USA Today. ""The $61.6 trillion in unfunded obligations amounts to $528,000 per household,"" it said. ""That's more than five times what Americans have borrowed for everything else — mortgages, car loans and other debt. It reflects the challenge as the number of retirees soars over the next 20 years and seniors try to collect on those spending promises.""

USA Today provided a breakdown of money owed, based on 2010 figures.

• Medicare: $24.8 trillion. ""This demographic burst — combined with the addition of a prescription drug benefit in 2006 and rising health care costs generally — has created an unfunded liability of nearly $25 trillion over the lifetime of those now in the program as workers and retirees."" 

• Social Security: $21.4 trillion. ""Social Security's long-term shortfall grows about $1.2 trillion annually — a sign of an imbalance between the number of young workers and older beneficiaries, according to the Social Security trustees' annual reports. The $21.4 trillion unfunded liability represents the difference between all taxes that will be paid and all benefits received over the lifetimes of everyone in the system now — workers and beneficiaries alike.""

• Federal debt: $9.4 trillion. This has grown since the USA Today report. The U.S. Treasury put the debt at about $15.677 trillion as of May 14.

Defining an unfunded liability

Our main concern with Romney’s statement is that it counts obligations to be paid in the future as debt for today’s families. This might sound reasonable, but thinking of debt this way presents some tricky issues. 
What Romney did was take the amount predicted that we will owe over the next 75 years for Social Security and Medicare, subtracted what we will take in to fund them, and then divided that sum by the current total of households.

Technically, though, shortfalls in Social Security and Medicare aren’t unfunded liabilities, said J.D. Foster, an economist with the right-leaning Heritage Foundation. ""Legally, they are not liabilities. They can be referred to accurately as promises or obligations."" (He spoke with our sister site PolitiFact Virginia last year on the same topic.)

Foster said the benefits do not qualify as liabilities because Congress can change the terms of Medicare and Social Security at any time.

Foster told us in an email for this article that Romney’s calculation is valid. However, the figures for unfunded promises differ from common debt.

Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist Brookings Institution, also pointed out that future benefits for entitlements are not ""owed"" to seniors in the same way that the public debt is owed to the people and institutions who purchased U.S. government debt.

""Congress can and almost certainly will reduce the future benefits promised to people who will receive Medicare and Social Security in the future,"" Burtless said via email. ""Moreover, even if Congress does NOT act before the Trust Funds are depleted, under current law Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries would receive less than the amount of benefits provided to current beneficiaries. 
""Why? Because the Secretary of the Treasury can only pay for those benefits out of the Trust Funds, and if the Trust Funds are depleted of cash, the rate of spending out of it will be limited to rate at which the Trust Funds are replenished with tax revenues flowing in under the current tax schedule.""

Michael Linden, of the liberal Center for American Progress, said it’s silly to divide our current debt by the number of households because no one suggests that we equally apportion the debt and pay it all off tomorrow.

""How does it make sense to apply potential debt borrowed in 2085 to families today?"" he asked.

Linden also said that while it’s true that revenues for Social Security and Medicare are projected to fall short of meeting needs over the next several decades, the U.S. will also face the obligation to pay for trillions of dollars on defense over the next 75 years.

""That’s because the real worry is not the gap between spending and revenue in any given program (even those that are supposed to have dedicated revenue streams), but the gap between overall spending and overall revenues,"" Linden said via email. ""So my bottom line is that, while Mitt Romney’s math may be right, his implication is wrong, and his number is devoid of any actual meaning.""

Still, Romney’s underlying point that there is a fiscal imbalance is sound.

Alan Auerbach, an economist at Berkeley and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, said that by the numbers, Romney’s calculation is pretty much on target based on the government’s own projections. Auerbach said he has done similar calculations.

""I would and do call these unfunded liabilities,"" he wrote in an email. ""They differ from our explicit national debt liabilities in that we can reduce them by undertaking policy reforms, but under current policy they are indeed unfunded commitments. That is, they are obligations in excess of their dedicated funding sources (payroll taxes, premiums paid by Medicare enrollees, etc.).""

Our ruling

Romney said that the debt and unfunded liabilities of the federal government adds up to $520,000 per household. Romney relied on a 2011 article in USA Today that added up the debt at that time and the amount owed for entitlements -- the largest one was the amount owed for Medicare.

Most economists we spoke with disagree with calling the amount we will owe in the future for entitlements ""unfunded liabilities,"" because the government has the power to change the programs, either by reducing spending or increasing taxes. Those obligations are different than our current debt.

But Romney’s underlying point is true: Without significant changes, we are on track to owe a mind-boggling sum if we spend large sums without sufficient revenues. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/may/22/mitt-romney/romney-says-debt-plus-unfunded-liabilities-equals-/

Does Georgia have the lowest gas taxes in the country?
","
The Georgia Sierra Club surprised many when it recently announced it is against this summer’s voter referendum for a penny-per-dollar sales tax to pay for 157 projects aimed at easing traffic congestion in the Atlanta region.

The grass-roots environmental organization believes the current project list needs more ways to get Georgians away from their cars. (Just over half of the regional $6.14 billion list would go to mass transit projects, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported.) 

Director Colleen Kiernan suggested in a radio interview that the state could fund more mass transit projects by using money from Georgia’s gas tax. She said the tax, which helps fund area road and bridge work, has contributed to metro Atlanta’s asphalt-focused development patterns.

Kiernan then made a claim about the gas tax that had PolitiFact Georgia ready to take a road trip in a search for the truth.

""Right now, we have the lowest gas tax of anywhere in the country,"" Kiernan told WABE-FM’s Denis O’Hayer.

Kiernan thought she said Georgia has one of the lowest gas taxes in the nation. She argued she should still get high marks from the Truth-O-Meter.

""It should definitely be on the green side,"" she said, arguing for a Mostly True rating.

Kiernan sent us a report by University of Georgia researchers on whether the state’s motor use fuel tax collects enough revenue. The state’s Transportation Department asked UGA to do the research. 

The motor use fuel tax in most states is an excise tax, but several states impose an
excise tax, as well as a sales tax that is applied to the sale price of gasoline. 

Georgia’s excise tax is currently 7.5 cents a gallon. (Excise taxes are special taxes on the purchase of items such as gasoline, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Excise taxes are usually fixed amounts per item, rather than percentages of the price.) Georgia adds a 3 percent tax on sales of motor fuel that is classified as motor use fuel tax and a 1 percent tax that is received as general fund revenue. In 2008, the excise tax and both sales taxes combined produced an effective rate of 21.2 cents per gallon, the UGA report noted. About 17.8 cents per gallon is classified as motor use fuel tax, UGA said.

The UGA report, which came out in December 2010, said Georgia has one of the lowest excise taxes around, but Georgia is higher than most of its Southern neighbors if you include the sales taxes. 

Kiernan also forwarded us a link to a February 2010 report by the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization that does research on state and federal tax policy. The report showed Georgia’s gas tax per gallon was 12.4 cents, which was the second lowest in the nation. Alaska was the lowest at 8 cents per gallon. 

""Alaska is a different situation ... because they get so much of the revenue from oil and gas leasing,"" Kiernan said.

PolitiFact Georgia also looked at a January 2012 Tax Foundation state-by-state breakdown of state tax and other gas taxes and fees. 

Georgia’s excise tax was the second lowest (only Florida was lower). Other taxes and fees pushed the Peach State into the upper half of states with the 18th highest gas taxes at 29.4 cents per gallon. But those other fees and taxes include various county gas taxes. Kiernan was talking about state taxes.

An April 2012 breakdown by the American Petroleum Institute had the same numbers for most states, including Georgia, as the January Tax Foundation report. The breakdown has a column that includes federal taxes, which are 18.4 cents per gallon in every state.

Kiernan erred a bit in what she meant to say on a radio show with a large audience. 

Her larger point is supported by several charts that show Georgia has one of the lowest excise gas taxes in the nation. Her statement could have been more precise.

Still, under our rating system, she gets a Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/may/22/colleen-kiernan/does-georgia-have-lowest-gas-taxes-country/

Crossroads says health care law will force millions into ""government pool""
","
UPDATE: We have adjusted the statement to clarify that we are fact-checking the Crossroads GPS claim that ""millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool."" The ruling is unchanged.  
The conservative advocacy group Crossroads GPS has a new ad that says President Barack Obama has broken his campaign promises.

If you love your iPad, beware: The ad shows a tablet computer with its screen cracking apart. Each broken promise shatters the glass with a stomach-churning crunch.

""President Obama’s agenda promised so much,"" the ad says, then launches into a litany of broken promises.

One promise is about health insurance: The ad shows Obama saying, ""If you like your health care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health care plan.""

""Broken,"" the ad’s narrator says. ""Millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool.""

We’ll fact-check the ad’s other claims in separate reports. Here, we’ll look at people losing their health care.

Here at PolitiFact, we consider ourselves experts on the president’s campaign promises. Our Obameter tracks more than 500 campaign promises Obama made during the 2008 campaign, including many promises about health care.

Obama’s promise

Obama often said during his 2008 campaign for president that if people liked their health insurance, they wouldn’t have to change it under his proposal, and he continued to say it as president.

""If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,"" he said at a 2009 town hall meeting.

What Obama was talking about was the way his plan left in place the current health care system in the United States. Instead of completely revamping the system, Obama’s plan put more regulations on insurance companies, and it offered subsidies to coverage for the uninsured so they could either buy insurance on their own or sign up for the existing program of Medicaid. Most significantly, his plan left in place both Medicare for seniors and employer-provided insurance for workers.

The problem with the promise, though, was that some of Obama’s regulations will change how health insurance companies offer plans. It’s also likely it will change the decisions employers make about health coverage, at least to some extent.

Some workers might see improved coverage, while others see more expensive coverage. Some might see major changes, while others might see trivial changes. In many cases, Obama’s law beefs up requirements on insurance companies.

On the whole, we rated Obama’s statement Half True.

Having said that, the health care law that Obama signed looks a lot like what he promised on the campaign trail. It leaves in place employer-provided insurance and Medicare. It puts new regulations on health insurance companies. It offers assistance to the poor and people of modest means to obtain coverage. (Want more detail? Read our story ""Everything You Want to Know about the Health Care Law."")

Millions lose coverage?

The Crossroads ad adds a new wrinkle on this fear-laced claim: ""Millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool.""

Text on the screen sources the claim to The Hill’s ""Health Watch"" column of March 15, 2012. The Hill is a newspaper that covers Washington and Congress.

When we dug into this claim, we found The Hill’s coverage referred to a recent report from the Congressional Budget Office, a respected independent agency that conducts economic analysis of pending and existing law.

Here’s how The Hill described the CBO report:

As many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-provided coverage because of President Obama's healthcare reform law, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a new report Thursday.

The figure represents the worst-case scenario, CBO says, and the law could just as well increase the number of people with employer-based coverage by 3 million in 2019.

The best estimate, subject to a ""tremendous amount of uncertainty,"" is that about 3 million to 5 million fewer people will obtain coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022.

We’ve looked into the CBO report ourselves for other fact-checks.

CBO and other independent groups project that the number of uninsured will actually decrease because of the health care law. Estimates vary, but the CBO has projected that between 29 million to 31 million uninsured Americans will gain access to coverage.

The law will cause some shifting around of how people get their insurance, though. That’s what the CBO report documents. Many of those people that leave employer-provided insurance would get coverage some other way, such as buying it on their own with help from a government subsidy. (Read a more detailed analysis of the CBO report here.) Actually, some of those people will prefer to buy insurance on their own in order to get health insurance that better suits their particular preferences.

Significantly, the Crossroads ad doesn’t mention any of those specifics. Its point seems to be simply that a lot of people will lose coverage. This is deeply misleading, because the law will increase the number of people who have coverage.

Then there’s the part of the claim that says millions would be ""forced into a government pool."" We couldn’t make heads or tails of this sentiment, but Crossroads responded to our questions by saying that people who buy insurance on their own are being ""forced into a government pool.""

The exchanges are new virtual marketplaces where people who buy insurance on their own will be able to comparison shop for plans. And technically speaking, this is a pool, because people who buy on the exchange will be able to buy plans regardless of any pre-existing health conditions.

Under the terms of the plan, some of the people will be buying insurance with a government subsidy, but some will be buying with their own money. But they’ll be buying plans from private insurance companies, to be treated by non-government doctors and hospitals.

Given the contours of the health care debate over the past two years, the ad seems like it’s trying to confuse people into thinking they’ll be signed up for a government-run health plan like Medicare. That’s actually not the case.

Our ruling

The Crossroads ad says Obama ""promised"" people could keep their health plans, but ""millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool.""

Actually, Obama’s plan leaves the existing health system largely in place. And ""millions"" of uninsured will actually gain coverage, according to independent analysis.

Also, there’s no option for a government-run health care option under the new health insurance exchanges. The term ""government pool"" seems aimed at confusing this issue.

In fact, the health care plan Obama promised on the campaign trail looks an awful lot like what was put into law: Leave the existing health care system in place, beef up regulations on insurance companies, and offer assistance to the uninsured to help them sign up for health coverage.

"['County Budget', 'Transportation', 'Texas', 'Ron Davis']","
Travis Commissioner Ron Davis says more than 40% of bond money to be spent in his precinct because he's quick to identify projects
","
In a campaign flier, Democrat Ron Davis says that as a Travis County commissioner, he has worked to ""bring in what’s good"" to the northeastern portion of the county, which he represents. 
He then highlights the amount of money slated to be spent on road and other projects in his precinct, No. 1, from a bond package approved by Travis County voters in 2011. ""Over 40 percent of recent county bonds are for Precinct One, northeast Travis County,"" the flier says. ""Why? Because Commissioner Ron Davis is quick to identify projects that help make the East Side a desirable place to live."" 
Davis, first elected in 1998, has three challengers in the May 29, 2012, Democratic primary: Del Valle school board member Richard Franklin III, Pflugerville City Council Member Victor Gonzales and former City of Austin employee Arthur Sampson. 
For this article, we fact-checked whether Davis was right about the amount of bond money headed to his precinct — and whether the money was spent on his projects because he was quick to point them out. 
On the first front, Davis’ number stands up. The second aspect proved impossible to confirm. 
The Travis County Commissioners Court consists of four commissioners and the county judge, who is elected countywide. Each commissioner represents a single precinct, and each precinct is drawn by the commissioners to represent about the same number of residents. That means that if bond money were to be distributed evenly among the population, each precinct would get about 25 percent of the funds. So, Davis’ statement that more than 40 percent of the spending authorized in the recent bond vote will happen in a single precinct (his) — for whatever reason — drew our attention. 
Let’s look first at the bonds approved by voters. 
Travis County residents voted in November 2011 to give the county permission to borrow about $215 million over seven years for road, drainage and park improvements, as well as land purchases to preserve open space, according to a Nov. 8, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news article. 
Proposition 1, with $132.8 million in spending, authorized more than two dozen transportation projects to be built, including more than 20 miles of new or expanded roads, the article says. Proposition 2 allowed $82.1 million to be spent on eight park projects or land purchases. 
An Oct. 23, 2011, pre-referendum Statesman news article about Proposition 1 notes that the proposed transportation projects were not evenly spread among the county’s precincts. The bulk of the sought spending, the article says, would take place in the rapidly developing northeastern part of the county near the 5-year-old Texas 130 tollway. But the story did not speak to how much of the overall proposed bonds would support projects in Precinct 1. 
On that front, Davis’ campaign sent us a spreadsheet detailing the bond proceeds that will be spent in Precinct 1: $90.4 million, which the spreadsheet accurately says is 42 percent of the bond money approved by voters in 2011. 
Specifically, Davis’ spreadsheet has 19 entries. The first 13 are separate Precinct 1 road projects, including more than $12 million to widen part of Blake-Manor Road from two to four lanes and add bike lanes and sidewalks, as well as about $300,000 to add sidewalks to part of Hunters Bend Road. The 13 road projects account for more than $70 million of Davis’ cited $90.4 million. 
The next two entries in the Davis campaign’s spreadsheet are estimates — done by Steven Manilla, head of the county’s Transportation and Natural Resources Department — of how much Precinct 1 will get from about $5 million in bond money that was approved for road repairs and bike safety projects countywide. Manilla estimated that Precinct 1 will get about $3.4 million of that money. 
The final four spreadsheet entries are estimates, also from Manilla, of Precinct 1’s share of Proposition 2 bond money, including $10 million to buy land for parks along creeks and rivers and $1.3 million for improvements at East Metro and Webberville parks. 
We spotted a couple of wrinkles in the campaign’s breakdown. 
First, we noticed that the Davis campaign lowballed the cost of each of the 13 road projects by using figures not taking into account money included in the bond propositions to cover inflation costs and expenses associated with issuing bonds — meaning Davis’ analysis undercounts the share of the total bond money going to Precinct 1. So, we adjusted the figures in the spreadsheet, which lifted the Precinct 1 share to about 45 percent. 
However, the biggest single expenditure on Davis’ breakdown, more than $15 million to widen a section of Cameron Road and add bike lanes and sidewalks, reflects spending in neighboring Precinct 2 as well as Precinct 1. Manilla told us in an interview that’s because that part of Cameron Road, on the western side of Texas 130, is the boundary between the two precincts. 
Removing half of the funding for the Cameron Road project drops the Precinct 1 share a little, to 41 percent — still in line with the ""over 40 percent"" that Davis cites. 
Precinct 1’s share of the bond money is larger than that of the other precincts, Manilla told us. He said Precinct 3, which covers most of the western portion of the county, came in second, with 25 percent of the bond money. 
So, Davis’ cited percentage holds. 
However, we did not find independent indicators to support, or disprove, his contention that the share of bond money flowing to Precinct 1 reflects his quickness to identify desires. 
In a telephone interview, Davis described himself as a strong advocate who begins thinking well in advance about what projects should be in an upcoming bond package and communicating with county staff members about problems such as traffic congestion and how they can be addressed. He identifies what his precinct needs, he said, by listening to residents and assessing what infrastructure projects are necessary to accommodate the development happening in that part of the county. 
Davis also said his quick work to ready projects for the bond package means that when a project in another part of the county falls through, he has something ready to go to fill the opening. ""If you snooze, you lose,"" he said. 
We asked Davis whether there was a way to document his quick identification of projects for his district and how it has influenced which projects ended up in the 2011 bond package. He said the results of his work are reflected in ""what’s on the ballot."" He also said much of his cited work to ready projects came in responding to and meeting with constituents, which he said he didn’t document. 
Manilla, who similarly said Davis reacts quickly to constituent complaints, told us by phone that he did not have a way to document the commissioner’s quickness to identify potential bond-election items. 
According to Manilla and county documents, items made it onto the 2011 bond election ballot through a process involving more than the commissioners and county judge. 
After the Commissioners Court signed off in December 2010 on preparing for the 2011 bond vote, county staff put together a list of 120 possible bond projects with a total price tag of $638 million. A citizens bond advisory committee then shortened the list, which commissioners tweaked before unanimously voting to put the propositions before voters. 
Manilla noted a couple of ways that commissioners can influence the makeup of a bond package, pointing out that commissioners communicate with county staff members about what projects are needed in their precincts. He also said commissioners can influence the work of the citizens bond committee through their appointees; each commissioner and the county judge, who leads the Commissioners Court and is elected countywide, selects three people to serve on the committee. 
And, of course, commissioners ultimately vote to put the projects before voters and can make changes to the final list. At their Aug. 9, 2011, meeting, the commissioners made a few revisions, including adding a Precinct 1 road project — the widening of Taylor Lane. Davis was the commissioner who moved to have the project added. 
We asked County Judge Sam Biscoe to address Davis’ claim that his quick identification of projects caused Precinct 1 to land its share of bond-backed items. Biscoe declined. Broadly, Biscoe earlier told us that each commissioner merits some credit for the bond proposals affecting their districts, but not all of it. ""I have no reason to think (Davis) didn’t do his part,"" Biscoe said. ""But I do know there were many other contributors."" He pointed to the work done by the county staff, the other commissioners, himself and the citizens committee. 
Biscoe also agreed that the heavy amount of development taking place in the northeastern part of Travis County is a reason more bond money is being spent on infrastructure projects there. Historically, Biscoe said, there wasn’t much development in the area so there was no need for the projects. Now, there’s a lot of development, he said, ""so we are trying to catch up."" 
Our ruling 
The numerical part of Davis’ two-part claim — that more than 40 percent of the 2011 bond money will be spent in Precinct 1 — holds up. But the determining impact of Davis’ quickness is unproved. It’s our sense that several factors, perhaps including the commissioner’s alacrity, affected which items landed on the ballot.

Chamber of Commerce claims 20 million people will lose their current coverage because of health care reform
","
Alan Grayson’s four-year-old quip about Republicans’ plan for healthcare reform -- remember his ""die quickly"" rant? -- is getting new life this election cycle.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is using it against him in a TV attack ad airing in May 2012. Grayson, who represented House District 8 until Dan Webster unseated him in 2010, is running for a new Orlando seat.

The commercial is part of a broader campaign by the lobbying group targeting Democrats over their support of ""Obamacare,"" including Florida Sen. Bill Nelson. (Read our fact-checks of the Nelson ad here and here).

This commercial compares Grayson to a literal broken record, repeating his explosive lines on the floor.

Narrator: ""Reckless politicians gave us Obamacare. Alan Grayson was one of Obamacare’s biggest cheerleaders. He’d say anything.""

Grayson: ""Die quickly. The Republicans want you to die quickly.""

Narrator: ""Now we learn Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage.""

Another record appears with Grayson’s face on it, labeled ""Obamacare Unconstitutional.""

Narrator: ""And a Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional. Will Alan Grayson change his tune on Obamacare, or be the same broken record?""

PolitiFact Florida fact-checked the ad’s claim that a Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional and found it Mostly True.

For this story we’re focused on the ad’s first claim that Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage.

It’s familiar ground for us, with mixed rulings depending on the context. When Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said ""as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance thanks to Obamacare,"" we rated the statement Half True.

When the chamber claimed ""20 million people could lose their current coverage"" -- and suggested that included seniors who rely on Medicare -- in its anti-Nelson ad, we rated it Pants on Fire!

The claim in this commercial’s context is pretty straight-forward. We’ll explain.

The 20-million figure is a projection from nonpartisan researchers at the Congressional Budget Office. You should know CBO has also projected the law will lead to new coverage for about 30 million uninsured Americans.

The real issue here is a shift in how some people will get their health insurance.

The RNC previously directed us to a March 2012 study by the CBO  that aimed to estimate the impact of the health care law on the number of people obtaining health care coverage from their employer.

CBO’s best guess was that between 3 million to 5 million fewer people, on net, will obtain coverage through their employer from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed.
   
CBO supplemented its projection with four alternative scenarios. Among the scenarios: One actually resulted in a net gain of 3 million people with employer-sponsored insurance. The others resulted in a decrease of 10 million, a decrease of 12 million, and -- here it is! -- a decline of 20 million. (Read this fact-check for more details about the CBO report.)

Priebus was partially accurate in his op-ed, but this is the most extreme outcome of five possible outcomes presented, and it’s not the primary estimate, which is about 5 million, or one-quarter the number Priebus offered.
   
So Priebus -- and now the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- has engaged in cherry-picking.

There’s more context to consider. Not everyone who ""loses"" their employer coverage will do so involuntarily. According to the CBO, some people will spurn their employer’s offer of insurance and turn instead to another source, such as the health insurance ""exchanges"" created under the Obama health care law -- virtual marketplaces for each state where applicants will be able to compare and purchase plans that offer at least a minimum bundle of benefits.

In many cases, they will do this because they consider the employer’s offering to be unaffordable or lacking too many features they need. So those people aren't being forced off the employers' plans; they are choosing to switch.
   
Plus, the 20 million figure does not account for the 9 million people who wouldn’t have had an employer plan before but will get coverage after passage of the law because of the law’s mix of subsidies and penalties for employers.

Our ruling

The U.S. Chamber said, ""Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage."" It's a claim that is oft-repeated and much exaggerated.

The chamber employs a worst-case projection by a nonpartisan research agency. The agency’s other forecasts are lower, but you wouldn’t know that from watching the ad. And unlike Priebus, the group does not specify that the type of insurance potentially affected is a specific type of insurance -- ""employer-based"" insurance.

Plus, this 20 million estimate only counts people who receive coverage from their employer -- and not those who might receive better coverage elsewhere.

Most importantly, this figure does not represent uninsured people who will get coverage because of the law.

Mitt Romney said he ""actually cut"" spending as Massachusetts governor
","
In recent campaign events, Mitt Romney has made the federal debt a major issue, even standing in front of an oversized debt clock during a visit to St. Petersburg, Fla.

In an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Romney made a point of contrasting the fiscal record of President Barack Obama with his own record as governor of Massachusetts. Romney was elected governor in 2002 and served one four-year term.

""Issue by issue, (voters) have an opportunity to see my record when I was governor of Massachusetts,"" Romney said in the May 12, 2012, interview. ""We were able to cut back on the size of government. Actually, we didn't just slow the rate of growth of our government, we actually cut it. We pulled back on the spending of our state.""

We wondered whether that accurately reflected Romney’s fiscal record in the Bay State.

Looking at the numbers

We turned to the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent group that studies fiscal policy in the state. They provided us with the figures for total state spending.

Determining the proper time frame for judging Romney’s claim is tricky, since the governor’s term doesn’t line up precisely with the state’s fiscal year. Romney would have had no influence on the 2002 budget, but he would have had responsibility (along with the Legislature) for the second half of the 2003 budget, as well as authority (again, with the Legislature) for 2004, 2005 and 2006, and, finally, for the first half of the 2007 budget.

So in a moment, we’ll look at two possible time frames. First, here are the raw numbers, sometimes known as the ""nominal"" numbers:

Fiscal year 2002 (no Romney influence): $22.47 billion
Fiscal year 2003 (partial-year Romney influence): $22.25 billion
Fiscal year 2004 (full-year Romney influence): $22.49 billion
Fiscal year 2005 (full-year Romney influence): $24.22 billion
Fiscal year 2006 (full-year Romney influence): $25.44 billion
Fiscal year 2007 (partial-year Romney influence): $27.92 billion

If you compare fiscal 2007 (the last year Romney had any influence on the budget) to fiscal 2002 (the last year before he had any influence), spending rose by about 24 percent over five years, or a little under 5 percent per year.

If you instead compare 2006 (the last all-Romney budget) to 2003 (the first partial Romney budget), the increase is 14 percent over three years, which is also an increase of just under 5 percent per year.

So however you look at it, nominal spending -- that is, the number of dollars spent, without any kind of mathematical adjustments -- increased on Romney’s watch. That makes his claim incorrect.

There are at least two other ways of looking at the numbers -- adjusting the numbers for inflation, and comparing state spending to total income earned in the state. (Romney’s campaign did not return an inquiry, so we’re not sure what measurement they were using.)

The Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, an affiliate of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, offers a user-friendly tool for delving into Massachusetts fiscal data. For the inflation-adjusted numbers, spending fell by about three-tenths of 1 percent over the five-year period discussed above, or by about four-tenths of 1 percent percent over the three-year alternative period. Those are small declines, but they are declines.

Meanwhile, spending as a percentage of income earned in the state rose by 0.13 percentage points over the five-year period, or by 0.01 percentage points over the three-year time span. These are small increases, but they are increases.

Still, we feel most comfortable using the most basic statistic -- nominal dollars -- because of how Romney worded his claim. Romney didn’t include any qualifications, like ""we cut spending to below the growth of inflation"" or ""we cut spending as a share of state income."" He simply said that his administration cut spending, period. That suggests to us that nominal dollars are the best yardstick.

Andrew C. Bagley, director of research and public affairs for the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, agreed.

""Gov. Romney said he cut spending in state government,"" Bagley said. ""Comparing spending to (state income) may provide interesting insights, but it does not help address the question of whether state spending increased during Gov. Romney’s term.""

Who gets the credit?

When rating claims, PolitiFact factors in not only whether the claim is numerically correct but also whether it’s appropriate for the speaker to assign credit or blame. In this case, Romney certainly had some influence on the Massachusetts budget, but he also had to work with an overwhelmingly Democratic Legislature -- one that continually rebuffed his policies.

""The Democrats had veto-proof majorities in both chambers and rewrote Romney’s budget, as they have with all governors’ budgets, to what they wanted,"" said Fred Bayles, director of the Boston University Statehouse Program. ""Romney’s attempt at vetoing or adding language to the final document were all blocked, with the exception of a few vetoes he issued toward the end of his term when the Legislature was away.""

Our ruling

We believe the measure that best fits Romney’s no-frills claim is to use raw dollars -- and by that measure, spending rose by an average of about 5 percent per year during Romney’s term. We also should note that many of Romney’s efforts to shape the budget were summarily rejected by the Democratic legislature, so claiming full credit for any budgetary trends on his watch is a stretch. On balance, we rate Romney’s claim False.",/factchecks/2012/may/21/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-said-he-actually-cut-spending-massachu/

Cory Booker said black people represent more than 60 percent of New Jersey’s prison population
","
If the United States wants to secure a future as a leading democracy, it must invest in its children, according to Newark Mayor Cory Booker.

But right now the country is failing to live up to its potential, Booker said in a speech at a May 4 forum held by the American Federation for Children, a group that advocates for school choice. At the end of his speech, Booker, talking about ""the carnage that happens when we fail to live up to the promise of this nation,"" told a story about the death of a boy he knew when he first took office in 2006.

While recounting that story, Booker stopped himself and said: ""I know the data. I see what's happening to young minority men in this country. I see how much, when looking from a financial perspective how much we as taxpayers pay, billions of dollars in New Jersey for a prison system or correctional system that doesn't correct. Recycling the same people over and over and over again. A prison system that is 61 percent African-American even though our state is just 13 percent black.""

PolitiFact New Jersey checked Booker’s statistics on the state’s prison population and found that he knows the data well.

New Jersey housed 23,810 people in all of its correctional facilities, including halfway houses and county jails, as of Jan. 3, according to data from the state department of corrections.

Of those nearly 24,000 offenders, 61 percent, or 14,469 people, are black. By comparison, 22 percent, or 5,300 inmates, are white and 16 percent, or 3,785 inmates, are Hispanic.

New Jersey’s prison population, excluding offenders held in a facility for women and another facility for adult male sex offenders, is smaller, with 15,407 inmates. Of that population, 62 percent are black.

How does the racial makeup of the state’s prison population compare with the state’s overall population?

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 13.7 percent of New Jersey’s population is black.

So Booker’s numbers are right. But we wondered how New Jersey compares with the rest of the nation.

Based on estimates from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, nearly 38 percent of prisoners under state and federal jurisdiction at the end of 2010 were black. According to the same data, about 32 percent of prisoners were white and more than 22 percent were Hispanic. The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than one year.

Overall, 12.6 percent of the U.S. population is black, according to 2010 census data.

John M. Paitakes, professor of criminal justice at Seton Hall University, said there are many factors behind these statistics, citing prior records and legal representation. He also noted that profiling and prejudice could be factors, but said, ""I don’t think it’s any more in New Jersey than in other areas.""

""I think before you draw any conclusions you have to look at all those factors to get a realistic picture of what it is,"" he said.

Our ruling

Booker said New Jersey’s prison system is ""61 percent African-American even though our state is just 13 percent black.""

Data from the state corrections department and U.S. Census Bureau back his statistics.

We rate the claim True.

Mayor Kasim Reed: Airport concession awards most open and transparent in city history
","
Critics dogged the city of Atlanta every step of the way during its long slog to award $3 billion worth of contracts at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.

Businesses vying to sell food and gifts to travelers howled in protest last year when the city rebooted the process after too many hopefuls fouled up their paperwork.

Some complained decisions were made in haste, or favored businesses with political connections. Others protested when a major vote took place after a closed-door City Council session. Companies that lost out, including Virginia-based SSP America, filed suit.  

Mayor Kasim Reed’s administration waged a public war against them. An April 25 press release issued by his office called SSP out by name.   

""The city is hopeful that SSP America . . .  will finally cease its litigious and wasteful efforts to overturn the fairest, most open and transparent procurement process in the city’s history,"" said the release, which was sent out by Reed’s representatives.

The most ""open and transparent""? That sounds out of character for Hartsfield-Jackson, where dealings have a history of being anything but these things.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, concession operators paid more than $1 million in bribes to elected officials, according to a federal investigation. Seven people, including two former city councilmen, were convicted or pleaded guilty to related crimes.

Former Mayor Bill Campbell famously served federal prison time in the mid-2000s for failing to pay $160,000 in taxes. Prosecutors said he secretly used airport and other city contracts to make himself and his friends rich.

And last year, the city agreed to a $3.9 million legal settlement with Atlanta businessman Billy Corey and his business Corey Airport Services. He argued that the procurement process was rigged when he lost out on an airport advertising contract in 2002.

Now, we’ll cover why Atlanta officials think this latest round was the most open and transparent in city history.

City spokeswoman Sonji Jacobs, whose name was listed on the press release, gave four major arguments:

City officials put a big bundle of airport concessions contracts out to bid at once.

Businesses competed for 11 concessions contracts: nine for restaurants and two for shops. They were worth about $3 billion in revenue over 10 years.

Something similar took place in February 1995. The city tried to wipe the slate clean by opening bidding on ""almost every concessions space at Hartsfield,"" including restaurants and gift shops, according to a story in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

City officials released names of project evaluators.

Reed announced in June 2011 that he would release the names of evaluators on a panel that reviews and recommends proposals. He said this transparency would head off accusations of conflicts of interest.

Instead, the city waited until January -- after the City Council approved the contracts. Jacobs said in the mayor’s defense that this was earlier than state open records law requires.

But council members Michael Julian Bond and Felicia Moore told PolitiFact Georgia that under prior administrations, they received evaluator names and related information before the bids went before the full council.

And Jacobs’ point about public records law is debatable.  

Nothing in state law says names of committee members appointed by a public agency can be kept secret, Hollie Manheimer, executive director of the Georgia First Amendment Foundation, told PolitiFact Georgia.

Reed returned legally obtained campaign contributions from those vying for contracts.      

Reed stopped receiving campaign donations from these businesses in late June 2011, and returned some money. We found no evidence that prior Atlanta mayors have taken this step.

However, this is more of an anti-influence peddling measure than a transparency effort.  

The city released more than 1 million pages of records detailing the procurement process.

We found no evidence that other administrations have gone through the expense and effort of releasing this many documents. But at first, they didn’t do it willingly.

Officials released these documents in January after losing concessionaires sued, saying the administration violated public records law by withholding them.

The Fulton court’s chief judge wrote in a March order that ""only after entry of several court orders"" did the city begin to produce more public records related to the bid process. Since then, though, it has provided many of them.

SSP’s lawyer accused the city’s chief procurement officer of directing city workers to destroy them, but George Maynard, the hearing officer assigned to SSP’s appeal, determined there was no evidence of ""fraud, corruption or abuse.""

Watchdog groups and some elected officials want more. They noted Maynard was appointed by the mayor, and were concerned that the city’s transportation committee had 12 hours or less to inspect key concessions contract documents before they voted to approve them.  

To conclude:

This latest round of airport contract proposals was not as open as it could have been, and three of the four arguments the city used to claim unprecedented transparency fall short.  

Still, it may well have been more transparent than all others in Hartsfield-Jackson history. We could find no other instances where more than 1 million pages of documents were put out for public review.

That said, the city was legally obliged to provide those pages.

The statement is likely accurate, but meaningless. It’s no great achievement for a city to do what the law requires. Unless that city is Atlanta.

This claim lacks important details, which means it earns a Half True.",/factchecks/2012/may/21/kasim-reed/mayor-kasim-reed-airport-concession-awards-most-op/

That Hillary Clinton 'undercover nurse' story is bogus
","Hillary Clinton’s health scare in New York at a Sept. 11 memorial ceremony fueled plenty of speculation and conspiracy chatter on the Internet. It’s now bubbling into the mainstream media.

Barack Obama says Trump foundation took other people's money, bought a six-foot-tall painting
","President Barack Obama went to Philadelphia on Sept. 13 to campaign for Hillary Clinton, who was recovering from pneumonia. In his speech, Obama didn’t hold back in his critique of Clinton’s opponent, Donald Trump. In one particularly vivid line, Obama took a shot at Trump’s foundation, contrasting it with the Clintons’ foundation, which focuses on improving global health. The Clinton Foundation has been attacked by critics for taking money from donors who might have business before a future President Clinton. But Obama was having none of it. ""You want to debate foundations and charities?"" Obama said. ""One candidate's family foundation has saved countless lives around the world. The other candidate's foundation took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself."" Obama added, to laughter, ""I mean, you know, he had the taste not to go for the 10-foot version, but…"" We have previously written about how the Clinton Foundation helped 9 million people receive lower-cost HIV/AIDS medicine, as well as the foundation’s controversies. But what about Obama’s statement that Trump’s foundation ""took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself""? The White House confirmed that the statement stems from a widely read Washington Post story by reporter David Fahrenthold, who’s written a series of stories about Trump Foundation and has inquired with organizations around the country to see if they actually received money from the real estate mogul. Fahrenthold provided new details of his investigations in a Sept. 10, 2016, Post article headlined, ""How Donald Trump retooled his charity to spend other people’s money."" Based on a review of 17 years of tax filings by the Donald J. Trump Foundation and interviews with more than 200 individuals and groups who were listed as recipients of its gifts, Fahrenthold found that ""nearly all"" of its money in recent years has come from people other than Trump, with his most recent personal gift to the foundation’s coffers dating from 2008. Experts told Fahrenthold that such an arrangement ""is almost unheard of for a family foundation."" The story by Fahrenthold includes the anecdote referenced by Obama in Philadelphia, which Fahrenthold wrote was one of two cases he found in which Trump used his money from the charity to ""buy himself a gift."" By doing so, he wrote, the foundation appeared to be flouting IRS rules by buying items that only seemed to be for Trump’s benefit. ""In 2007, for instance, Trump and his wife, Melania, attended a benefit for a children’s charity held at Mar-a-Lago. The night’s entertainment was Michael Israel, who bills himself as ‘the original speed painter.’ His frenetic act involved painting giant portraits in five to seven minutes — then auctioning off the art he’d just created. ""He painted Trump. ""Melania Trump bid $10,000. ""Nobody tried to outbid her. "" ‘The auctioneer was just pretty bold, so he said, ""You know what just happened: When you started bidding, nobody’s going to bid against you, and I think it’s only fair that you double the bid,"" ' Israel said in an interview last week. ""Melania Trump increased her bid to $20,000. "" ‘I understand it went to one of his golf courses,’ Israel said of the painting. ""The Trump Foundation paid the $20,000, according to the charity that held the benefit."" Fahrenthold’s article notes that the Post submitted detailed questions to the campaign but officials declined to comment. The campaign did not respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact for this article. We asked Fahrenthold whether Obama’s version jibed with his reporting. ""It seems pretty accurate to me,"" Fahrenthold told PolitiFact. ""I talked to both the charity that held the auction and the artist who made the painting. They told me Melania Trump had actually been the one bidding on the painting at the auction, which she won for $20,000 -- half went to charity, half went to the artist. But the actual check came from the Trump Foundation, of which Donald is president and Melania is not an officer of any kind."" He added that the auction seems to have been held in 2006 but the check wasn’t cut until 2007, a year in which ""almost all of the money in the Trump Foundation was other people’s money."" Specifically, according to Fahrenthold’s reporting, the Trump Foundation began that year with $4,238 in the bank. Trump himself gave $35,000 to the foundation that year. But other donors gave $4.055 million, primarily a single $4 million gift from Vince and Linda McMahon, the founders of the WWE wrestling empire. Using the most generous calculation, Fahrenthold said, Trump’s own money accounted for less than 1 percent of the total amount that entered the foundation that year, $4,094,238. ""So it was almost all other people’s money,"" he said. So where is the painting? That’s a bit more mysterious. Even crowdsourcing the search through Twitter hasn’t produced a verified image of the painting. ""I can’t find the damn thing,"" Fahrenthold said. ""It’s out there somewhere. Neither the painter nor the charity -- the Children's Place at Home Safe, in Boca Raton, Fla. -- have been able to provide a picture of it."" Our ruling Obama said that Trump’s ""foundation took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself."" Fahrenthold verified the anecdote about the painting with the painter, and his reporting found that, at the time the painting was auctioned, the vast majority of funds in the foundation’s coffers were from other people, not Trump.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'Paul Wolfowitz']","
Wolfowitz wrongly says Germany, France thought Iraq had WMD
","Fifteen years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the debate continues over the events that led to the Iraq War. Appearing on NBC’s Meet the Press on the anniversary of the attacks, Paul Wolfowitz took questions from host Chuck Todd on the causes and outcomes of the war. Todd asked Wolfowitz, a former deputy secretary of defense, about the war’s stated rationale, which was that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Todd: ""Let me ask you this, then, who lied? Is it bad intelligence? You know, somebody got us into this and somebody convinced the United States Congress that weapons of mass destruction were imminent in Iraq, which is why so many Democrats and Republicans voted for this war. So who lied?"" Wolfowitz: ""I think the original liar is Saddam Hussein, who lied about what he had and we discovered he had more. Later, it seems he was lying that he had more than he really did have because he wanted to supposedly deceive the Iranians. The fact is, every intelligence service in the world, not just the Americans, the British, the Germans, the French, countries that opposed us in the war all believe that he had weapons of mass destruction."" The charge that President George W. Bush lied about the Iraq threat has spurred a cottage industry of accusers and defenders. Wolfowitz served under Bush from 2001 to 2005, and remains a Bush defender. Our fact-check asks a different question. We wanted to know if there really was wide consensus that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, especially from France and Germany. (Britain ultimately joined the United States in going to war.) We found much evidence that Germany and France were skeptical. A brief recap While weapons of mass destruction weren’t the only argument for going to war, they were pivotal in the debate. When Vice President Dick Cheney spoke at a veterans convention in August 2002, he described Iraq’s nuclear, chemical and biological capabilities. ""There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction,"" Cheney said. ""There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, and against us."" President George W. Bush in his 2003 State of the Union Address suggested that Iraq had an active nuclear program. ""The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa."" In February 2003 at the United Nations, Secretary of State Colin Powell gave several examples, including biological weapons factories that traveled on rails and wheels. ""The trucks and train cars are easily moved and are designed to evade detection by inspectors,"" he said. ""In a matter of months, they can produce a quantity of biological poison equal to the entire amount that Iraq claimed to have produced in the years prior to the Gulf War."" Powell said the existence of these factories was confirmed by an eyewitness. In our review, we found that the French investigated nuclear matters while the Germans investigated chemical and biological weapons. We’ll look at each in turn. The Germans and a man called 'Curveball' Germany’s political leaders vigorously opposed the war. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder joined with the French in refusing to sanction the use of force. ""We can disarm Iraq without war,"" he declared in February 2003. Meanwhile, the United States was also absorbing information from the German intelligence service, or BND. When Powell told the United Nations there was eyewitness proof of mobile bio-weapons factories, he was referring to an Iraqi defector who had made it to Germany in 1999. Codenamed ""Curveball,"" Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi had spun a tale for German intelligence in a bid to secure a safe haven for himself. Curveball told the Germans about those mobile labs and said where the Iraqi military might be hiding them. But as we lay out in a bit, by the time Powell relied on that information, the Germans had already warned that the source could not be trusted. Now, to be clear, the record on this point is a bit mixed. The weight of evidence falls on the side that the Germans didn’t believe Iraq had a biological weapons program, but some information suggests they hedged their bets. In making that straddle, their words might have suggested to some American officials that German intelligence thought the threat was real. We’ll walk you through the highlights. A few weeks before the war in February 2003, Germany Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer had a tense moment with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld at a prominent security conference in Munich. ""I am not convinced,"" Fischer said to Rumsfeld. ""That is my problem. I cannot go to the public and say, 'these are the reasons,' because I don't believe in them."" Several years later, the Guardian newspaper reported that Fischer said, ""Our position was always: (Curveball) might be right, but he might not be right. He could be a liar, but he could be telling the truth."" In an investigative report by the Los Angeles Times, two ex-CIA officers said that the German warnings were more forceful than Fischer described. Tyler Drumheller, the former chief of CIA European operations, described a meeting in Washington with his BND counterpart in September 2002. Regarding Curveball, Drumheller said the German agent told him, ""We think he's probably a fabricator."" That meeting is also part of the 2005 report from the commission that investigated the intelligence failures leading up to the war. Another top American spy manager, James Pavitt, said that information led to screaming matches inside the CIA. ""My people were saying, 'We think he's a stinker.' "" Now, all of this suggests that German intelligence did not buy Curveball’s testimony and was unsure that Iraq had a biological weapons program. But one letter from the BND to the CIA might have given a different impression. According to the German news magazine Der Spiegel, in a December 2002 letter the Germans told the Americans ""the information was in essence judged as plausible and convincing, but it couldn't be confirmed."" Karl Kaiser, now at Harvard University’s Kennedy School, was director of the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin during this period. Kaiser told us he was in a pretty good position to know what the Germans thought. ""The hype about the alleged presence of WMD in the buildup to the Iraq invasion was not shared at all by the Berlin government,"" Kaiser said. ""The lack of belief in the existence of WMD in Iraq was a major reason why the Schroeder government in my opinion decided not to take part in the invasion."" Wolfowitz on the Germans When we asked Wolfowitz about the position of the Germans, he emphasized two points. First, Wolfowitz quoted extensively from the memoir of former CIA Director George Tenet, At the Center of the Storm. The excerpts referenced the letter in which the Germans called the Curveball information ""plausible,"" but they also largely drove home the point that if the Germans had doubts, those concerns didn’t make it up the chain of command. Tenet wrote that he only learned about those questions in 2005, ""two years too late to do a damn thing about it."" However, even if we take Tenet’s version of events at face value, that doesn’t mean the Germans thought Iraq had biological weapon factories. It just means the upper echelons of the CIA didn’t hear the full story about what the Germans thought. Wolfowitz made a different and stronger point about Iraq’s nuclear capabilities. He cited a March 2002 New Yorker article that included an interview with August Hanning, the BND chief. ""It is our estimate that Iraq will have an atomic bomb in three years,"" Hanning said. But about a year later, Hanning’s views seemed to have shifted. In February 2003, according to an article in Der Spiegel at that time, Hanning and one of his analysts briefed the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Bundestag, Germany’s parliament. The analyst told German lawmakers, ""Iraq has repeatedly purchased equipment and materials that could be used to produce new weapons of horror."" But then Hanning told them he did not believe that there was ""any evidence that the Iraqis had resumed their nuclear weapons program."" Both reports come from reputable news organizations. The February report came just a few weeks before the war began and suggests that the Germans both publicly and privately did not buy into the American view that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The uncertain French Like the Germans, French leaders opposed entering the war in Iraq. ""For us, war is always the proof of failure and the worst of solutions, so everything must be done to avoid it,""  said Jacques René Chirac, the former president of France in January 2003. And as far as weapons of mass destruction go, the French may have suspected that Iraq had them, but they weren’t certain. A report from the BBC in February 2003 said France, Germany and Russia released a ""joint declaration"" on the Iraq crisis, which called for more proof of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Chirac attended a joint news conference with Putin and said there was no ""undisputed proof"" that Iraq had the weapons of mass destruction. ""All possibilities of the resolution must be explored and that still leaves a lot of room for manoeuvre to achieve the goal of eliminating any weapons of mass destruction that Iraq may possess,"" Chirac said. Gérald Arboit, the director of research at the Centre Français de Recherche sur le Renseignement, said the French were uncertain about Curveball, who informed the Germans that Iraq had secret weapons. Arboit also said French intelligence knew that the Niger yellowcake that Bush referred to in the State of the Union address — yellowcake can be used to make weapons-grade uranium — was fake. Arboit said thanks to ties dating back to the colonial period, French intelligence had good sources in Niger. He also said the French nuclear power company Areva was active in the country and was a reliable source of information on uranium supplies. Robert Jervis, an international politics professor at Columbia University, said there were rumors that French intelligence, or the General Directorate for External Security (DGSE), was skeptical of the weapons. However, he added, ""As far as I know, neither the British nor the French challenged our intel estimates."" Michael O’Hanlon, a national security specialist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., also said he thought the Germans and French generally accepted the idea that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but he offered no specifics. Our ruling Wolfowitz said the French and Germans believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Publicly, the top elected leaders of both nations said that the evidence was unclear. The Germans, who had talked to an Iraqi defector, were the source of the suspicion that Iraq had developed mobile biological weapon factories. However, months before the war, the Germans had concluded that the defector was unreliable and passed that opinion on to the Americans. They didn’t discount his claim entirely, but they made it clear that it was unverified. The German intelligence agency seemed equally unconvinced that Iraq had resumed its nuclear program. For the French, the American assertion that Iraq sought to buy uranium from Africa rang hollow. The alleged source was Niger, a country where the French had contacts in the mining industry. They found  no proof for the claim. Anytime we deal with the activities of intelligence services, there are likely to be gaps in the public record.

Planned Parenthood Votes says Joe Heck 'voted to criminalize abortion for rape victims'
","An affiliate of Planned Parenthood has released an ad targeting Rep. Joe Heck, the Republican nominee in the neck-and-neck U.S. Senate race in Nevada. Accompanying a series of black-and-white images of women, a narrator says, ""It’s terrible, but it’s true. Joe Heck voted eight times to defund Planned Parenthood and would criminalize abortion for rape victims, because he’s a Washington politician before he’s a Nevada physician. And Planned Parenthood wants you to know that Joe Heck is dangerous to your health."" Heck is running against Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto in the open-seat race to succeed retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. We took a closer look at the part about criminalizing abortion, which was punctuated with text on the screen saying, ""Joe Heck voted to criminalize abortion for rape victims."" (We've already looked at Heck's record on voting to defund Planned Parenthood.) The idea of criminally punishing women for having an abortion has already come up in the 2016 campaign, as we’ve noted before -- and when it did, Republicans quickly backed off it. In an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews on March 30, 2016, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said women should be punished for having an abortion, but he quickly backtracked after an outcry, releasing a statement on his campaign website later that day. We found that there’s some truth behind the ad’s charge, but the Planned Parenthood Votes ad overplays its hand. In small type on screen, the ad cites media coverage of a 2012 bill that Heck co-sponsored and voted for  -- the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. (Planned Parenthood Votes confirmed in interviews that this was the legislation the ad was based on.) On July 31, 2012, the bill secured 220 yea votes and 154 nay votes in the Republican-controlled House. While that was a majority of the chamber, it did not pass because it did not reach the two-thirds minimum required for that type of vote. According to the bill summary, the measure would have amended the federal criminal code to ""prohibit any person from performing or attempting to perform an abortion"" after 20 weeks within the District of Columbia ""except in conformity with this act's requirements."" The exceptions, according to the bill text, would be risk of ""the death of the pregnant woman; or ... the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, not including psychological or emotional conditions, of the pregnant woman."" In other words, pregnancy through rape would not qualify for an exception under the bill. And the possible penalty could include a fine and up to two years in prison. But a key question is: A penalty for who? The answer is that the criminal risk would fall upon the doctor. In fact, the legislation includes language that specifically protects the woman getting the abortion from being prosecuted: ""A woman upon whom an abortion in violation of (this legislation) is performed or attempted may not be prosecuted under, or for a conspiracy to violate"" the measure. However, the Planned Parenthood ad fuzzes the difference between prosecuting the abortion provider and prosecuting the woman receiving the abortion. The use of ""for"" in the sentence ""Joe Heck voted to criminalize abortion for rape victims"" could be interpreted to mean that rape victims would bear the legal consequences, even though the law makes clear that they would not. In fact, the ad visually reinforces the notion that women would be left open to criminal penalties by featuring a succession of young women, none of whom wear the tools of the medical profession, such as a lab coat or a stethoscope. Planned Parenthood Votes said that even without criminal penalties for women, the bill would have had severe consequences for them, effectively making it impossible for rape victims to receive an abortion after 20 weeks. ""Joe Heck voted to criminalize abortion,"" said Erica Sackin, communications director for Planned Parenthood Votes. ""Whether the law sends women to jail or doctors to jail, the end result is the same: Women would have been left with nowhere to turn to for safe, legal abortion."" Our ruling The Planned Parenthood Votes ad said that ""Joe Heck voted to criminalize abortion for rape victims."" The group has a point that a bill Heck voted for and co-sponsored would have criminalized medical professionals from performing abortions after 20 weeks for rape victims who are not at risk of death or significant physical health complications due to pregnancy, at least in Washington, D.C. This would have eliminated all legal abortions for women in that category. However, the ad blurs the issue of whether medical professionals or the women themselves would be at risk of prosecution. Only medical professionals would face legal consequences under the bill, but the ad’s imagery implies otherwise, using only women as visuals.

Trump is right: Heroin is coming in through southern border
","Donald Trump tied the heroin epidemic gripping suburban white communities to the issue central to the campaign: border security and illegal immigration. The rate of heroin-related overdoses has nearly quadrupled between 2002 and 2013, with more than 8,200 deaths that year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Appearing on CNBC, Trump argued that this too is tied to weak borders. ""Our youth is being poisoned. You go to places like New Hampshire, where it’s the No. 1 thing, heroin, and it comes from the southern border. And you go to Ohio, as an example, I was there two days ago, and the biggest complaint they have is what’s pouring into there,"" Trump said, before repeating his False claim that Hillary Clinton ""is for open borders."" We’ve all heard of poppy fields blooming in Afghanistan, but is Trump right that heroin is entering the United States largely through the southern border? Yes. Even though Southwest Asia supplies heroin to most of the rest of the world, nearly all of the heroin available in the United States comes from Mexico and South America. ""Mexico, and to a lesser extent, Colombia, dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy US heroin demand,"" the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration wrote in its National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015. ""Mexico continues as the primary supplier of heroin to the United States,"" the White House’s page on the international heroin market reads. ""Estimated cultivation of opium poppy reached 10,500 hectares in 2012, with an estimated pure potential production of 26 metric tons."" Here’s a chart from the DEA report demonstrating the prevalence of heroin from the southern border:  As you can see, South America and Mexico have been the sources for much of the heroin in U.S. markets for the past two decades. In recent years, Mexican traffickers have expanded by simultaneously wedging black tar heroin into Northeastern markets dominated by Colombian white powder heroin and increasing production and distribution of white powder heroin themselves. Mexican heroin accounted for 45 percent of the total weight of heroin the DEA seized and analyzed in 2012 (South American heroin accounted for 51 percent). By 2014, the proportion of Mexican heroin had grown to 79 percent (South American heroin made up about 17 percent), DEA spokesman Russell Baer told PolitiFact. This market share is also reflected in the amount of heroin seized at the border and the amount grown in Mexico. From 2013 to 2015, the amount of poppy fields cultivated in Mexico increased by 169 percent from 11,000 hectares to 28,000 hectares, according to Baer.   In 2008, the total amount of heroin seized at the U.S.-Mexico border (about 560 kilograms) surpassed the amount seized from commercial airlines for the first time (about 400 kilograms). Border seizures nearly quadrupled from 2008 to 2015 (2,210 kilograms), according to data provided to us by Baer. ""The majority of the drugs in the U.S. market are trafficked across the Southwest Border from Mexico into the US. Southwest Border seizures conducted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, while not the complete picture, provide insight into trafficking trends,"" he said. Traffickers typically smuggle the drugs in through secret compartments in vehicles across the border (illegally and legally), transport them to stash houses in hub cities like Dallas, Los Angeles and Phoenix, and then distribute to the Midwest and East Coast. Here’s a map from the Justice Department that shows how heroin moves through the United States:  Our ruling Trump said heroin ""comes from the southern border.""

William Weld says 76% of Americans want Gary Johnson in debates
","The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has a rule about how third-party candidates can make it into the fall debates: They need to reach an average of at least 15 percent support in five preselected national polls. No third-party candidate is on track to meet that requirement yet, but the Libertarian Party ticket of Gary Johnson and William Weld thinks it has a shot, and they’re putting on a big push to make participation in the debates a reality. As part of their effort, Weld recently sought to harness the support of voters who may not be confirmed backers of their ticket but who do at least want to see third-party candidates on the debate stage. ""The mission of the Commission on Debates is to educate people about the presidential election,"" Weld wrote recently during a Reddit Ask Me Anything session he participated in with Johnson. ""76 percent of all voters in the United States say they want Johnson-Weld, by name, in the presidential debates. End of argument."" Weld later made the same point in a CNN interview with host Michael Smerconish on Sept. 10, saying, ""It's very easy to say we should be included in the debates when 76 percent of the people in the United States say they want us in the debates."" It turns out that Weld has a point, but he misstated some key details. The Johnson-Weld campaign did not reply to an inquiry for this article. The 76 percent figure comes from a Suffolk University poll conducted for USA Today and released Sept. 1. Here's the relevant question:  So Weld was on to something. However, it’s worth noting a few pieces of missing context. First, Weld said that voters in the poll wanted the ticket ""by name,"" but that’s not correct. The question asked, ""If a third-party candidate is certified by a majority of state ballots, should he or she be included in the debates this fall?"" Second, Weld said, ""76 percent of all voters in the United States."" In reality, the poll didn’t sample ""all voters"" -- or even all registered voters. It sampled 1,000 likely voters. Pollsters, especially as Election Day draws near, sometimes use methods, such as respondents’ past voting histories, to filter out the voters who are ""likely"" to vote. So Weld’s description of the Suffolk poll data overstates the case a bit. And there’s another issue: We found two other polls that specifically mentioned either Johnson-Weld or Johnson alone, and their figures were lower than the one Suffolk found. One is a poll by the web publication Morning Consult that surveyed 2,002 registered voters. It asked, ""Should Gary Johnson be included in the presidential debates?"" The poll found that 52 percent said yes, 22 percent said no and 26 percent didn’t know or had no opinion. (The same poll asked a similar question of Green Party candidate Jill Stein and found 47 percent support for her inclusion in the debates.)  The other poll was of 1,498 likely voters by Quinnipiac University on August 25. It asked, ""Do you think that Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate for president, should be included in the presidential debates this year, or not?"" This poll found that 62 percent said yes, 29 percent said no and 9 percent didn’t know or didn’t answer. So the other two polls that did mention Johnson by name found lower percentages of support for Johnson’s participation in the debates, though both still found majority support. David Paleologos, the director of the Suffolk poll, generally agreed that Weld’s statement left out some important information. ""The question was directed to the process of being certified on a majority of state ballots rather than introducing names,"" he said. He added, though, that the campaign might have some grounds to argue that the poll implicitly refers to them since they are currently the only campaign that will be on all 50 state ballots. Our ruling Weld said that ""76 percent of all voters in the United States say they want Johnson-Weld, by name, in the presidential debates."" Weld can point to recent a poll with that 76 percent figure, but his description of what it means isn’t entirely correct. It’s a poll of likely voters, not ""all voters in the United States,"" and the question didn’t mention Johnson or Weld ""by name."" However, a majority of voters do support Johnson’s inclusion in the debates -- a finding that holds in three recent polls on this question  Weld's talking point is onto something, but his phrasing misses nuance and overstates the case.

Yes on 55 school claim misses the mark
","Recent radio and TV ads claim California’s K-12 public schools face dire cuts if voters fail to approve Proposition 55, a measure on November’s ballot that would extend an income tax hike on wealthy residents. The ads by the Yes on 55 campaign paint a dark picture. They cite past spending cuts that led to thousands of teacher layoffs, eliminated art and music programs and increased class sizes a few years ago.   California, the ads claim, doesn’t have to repeat history. ""Prop 55 prevents $4 billion in new cuts to our schools simply by maintaining the current tax rates on the wealthiest Californians,"" says the Yes campaign’s ""Can’t Go Back"" TV ad.  The claim about ""$4 billion in new cuts to our schools"" is made at the 0:17 minute mark in this video. We wondered whether the choice is that stark: Does California really face $4 billion in new school cuts if Prop 55 fails? Our research Before diving in, here’s some background on the temporary tax increase Prop 55 asks voters to extend. In 2012, California voters approved Prop 30, which was promoted as a temporary solution. That measure raised income tax rates on high-income residents and sales tax rates through 2018 to pay for schools. Supporters at the time described it as a way to stave off additional deep education cuts from the state’s financial crisis and Great Recession. Prop 55 asks voters to continue that higher income tax rate for 12 additional years, through 2030, but not the sales tax increase. It would apply to earnings more than $250,000 for single filers and $500,000 for couples. If the measure fails, the higher income tax rate would phase out in 2018. Less money for schools? There’s no doubt the failure of Prop 55 would result in less money for public schools. The California Legislative Analyst’s Office projects Prop 55 would raise between $2 billion and $4.5 billion annually for K-12 schools and community colleges, depending on the economy. But even if Prop 55 fails, school funding would continue to increase through 2019-2020, according to Department of Finance figures. That’s in part because revenue from Prop 30 continues through the 2018-2019 fiscal year. It doesn’t run out right away. By 2019-2020, however, school costs would outpace total revenue by $4 billion, based on the end of Prop 30 and expected inflation, according to the state Department of Finance and an interview with Ana Matosantos, the department’s former director. Matosantos supports Prop 55 and spoke in favor of it at a recent public forum. ""Costs will rise faster than funding,"" Matosantos said in the interview. ""The big issue is inflation."" Competing outlooks There could be even greater pressure on school funding under one financial outlook, Matosantos said. That's because the state projects a separate $4 billion operating shortfall for the 2019-2020 fiscal year. That deficit is cited in the state Department of Finance’s multi-year budget outlook, and would account for the rising costs of everything from prisons to debt payments to health care, she said. Source: California Department of Finance, General Fund Multi-Year Forecast, June 2016 There’s no specific law that would require the state to cut school spending to close these shortfalls. It could take money from other services. But more than likely, Matosantos said, schools would experience cuts. Not everyone sees a bleak financial forecast. The Legislative Analyst’s Office expects California will have a nearly $2 billion operating surplus in 2019-2020, the same year the state Department of Finance forecasts a $4 billion operating shortfall.  Source: Legislative Analyst’s Office, Multiyear State Budget Outlook, May 2016 The Yes on 55 campaign ""is using the figures that are convenient to them,"" said David Wolfe, legislative director for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association. Wolfe spoke against Prop 55 at a recent forum. Steve Boilard, a Sacramento State University political analyst, expressed skepticism earlier this year over some Yes on 55 statements, including the campaign’s earlier claim in May that the measure’s failure could lead to $5 billion in cuts to schools. ""Looking at the numbers, I can see how they come up with dollar amounts that they do,"" Boilard, who spent years crunching budget numbers for the state’s non-partisan Legislative Analyst’s Office, said in a Capital Public Radio article, at the time. ""But I think it’s framed in a way that seems much more dire than it should otherwise be interpreted."" A Sacramento Bee fact check recently rated the Yes on 55 claim as ""iffy."" It found ""the ad’s warning of $4 billion in cuts if the measure does not pass relies on an optimistic assumption of how much money the tax will raise, as well as an overly simplistic characterization of school funding estimates. Our ruling The Yes on 55 campaign claimed in recent ads that ""Prop 55 prevents $4 billion in new cuts to our schools."" There would certainly be less money for schools if the tax extension fails. But the advertisements say nothing about the fact that Prop 30 was a temporary measure, and that its revenue was not promised forever. Nor do they mention that school budgets will continue to go up for several years until the Prop 30 revenue runs out after 2018. Supporters of 55 point to an estimated $4 billion school funding deficit by the 2019-2020 fiscal year, if the measure fails. They also cite a separate $4 billion operating shortfall for all its services by the same year. Another respected financial outlook, however, projects a $2 billion operating surplus for California that same year. That estimate paints a very different picture. If the ads had said Prop 55’s failure could lead to eventual school funding hardships, years from now, they would have been more accurate. But they leave the impression that the measure’s failure will lead to deep school cuts much sooner. And that’s not the case. We rate the Yes on 55 claim Mostly False.

Republican candidate for governor Chris Sununu says crime is rising in Manchester under Ted Gatsas
","In recent weeks, crime rates and drug problems in Manchester, the state’s largest city, have  come to the fore in New Hampshire’s race for governor. That’s no surprise, as one of the Republican candidates is Manchester Mayor Ted Gatsas. On the campaign trail, Gatsas often talks about making Manchester a safer city and fighting the ongoing heroin crisis. Executive Councilor and fellow Republican Chris Sununu targeted Gatsas’ record on crime. ""Ted Gatsas has let down Manchester: rising crime, higher taxes, the heroin crisis,"" Sununu said in an ad titled ""Fresh Leadership."" As Sununu spoke, a statistic flashed on screen: ""Manchester’s crime rate has increased by 19 percent."" We decided to see if crime in the Queen City has increased that much under Gatsas’ tenure. Sununu’s staff cited a WMUR article as evidence of a rising crime rate. Data from the Manchester Police Department showed that from 2008 to 2015, ""Part 1"" crimes, the most serious crimes, rose by 19 percent. Part 1 crimes include violent crimes such as homicide, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, as well as property crimes such as burglary, larceny/theft, motor vehicle theft and arson. In his ad, Sununu lays the blame at Gatsas’ feet. It’s important to note that Gatsas took the mayor’s office in 2010, after the crime trend cited by Sununu started. To see the bigger picture, we analyzed the FBI’s Uniform Crime Statistics for Manchester in five year increments from 2000 to 2015. The data shows an overall 17 percent increase in crime rates in Manchester, however, the biggest spike occurred from 2005 to 2010, before Gatsas took office. After Gatsas became mayor, crime went up about 9 percent, far less than Sununu’s statistic. Looking at year-over-year statistics while Gatsas has been mayor shows crime rising and falling in alternate years, rather than increasing steadily throughout. Crime rose the most dramatically in 2010 and 2012, when it shot up by 12 percent and 11 percent, respectively. Years 2011 saw a decrease of 8 percent while 2013 saw a decrease of 6 percent. Manchester police Chief Nick Willard also challenged Sununu’s claim and said crime has actually been going down in Manchester this year. Statistics released by the department show a 22 percent drop in property crimes between 2015 and 2016, which has driven the overall crime rate down 27 percent so far this year (the rates of violent crime have stayed on par with last year). Of course, the year isn’t over, so that number is subject to change. Manchester police attribute this drop to a new computer model they’ve implemented that allows them to predict where a crime is likely to occur. Using a crime-mapping program, the computer model analyzes where crimes have occurred in the past to predict where they might occur again. Willard said that program combined with more community policing and beefed up patrols has so far helped drop the city’s crime rate to drop this year. It’s important to note that economic factors and demographics have a greater influence over crime rates than a city’s elected leader. A chief executive can have some influence over crime rates through police funding, and Gatsas has been a law enforcement backer. Our ruling Chris Sununu says crime is ‘rising’ in Manchester and has gone up 19 percent under Mayor Ted Gatsas. Sununu didn’t specify a time range for his claim about crime in the state’s largest city. But looking at recent crime stats from the Manchester Police Department shows crime did increase by 19 percent from 2008 to 2015. However, Gatsas wasn’t in office that whole time and more recent data shows crime in the Queen City to be dropping or holding steady. It’s also dubious to link a crime rate, for good or ill, to any specific administration.

"['New Hampshire', 'Education', 'Voting Record', 'Ted Gatsas']","
Republican candidate for governor Ted Gatsas says opponent Chris Sununu has ""liberal record""
","School choice has become a contentious issue in New Hampshire’s race for governor. With four Republicans locked in a close primary fight, it’s an issue that could make a difference on Tuesday. Republican Ted Gatsas took aim at rival Chris Sununu in a recent ad, saying Sununu supported Common Core education standards. ""In Concord, Sununu supported Obama’s Common Core agenda, taking away local control of our schools,"" a narrator says in the ad titled ""Sununu's Liberal Record,"" that began airing at the start of September.  We decided to take a look. Gatsas’ claim contains several assertions that we can break down one-by-one. First, whether Sununu supported Common Core; second, whether Common Core takes away local control; and third, whether Common Core was Obama’s initiative. Sununu’s support The Common Core standards are a set of benchmarks for English and math developed after years of discussion between state education departments and non-governmental groups. The aim was to prepare pupils for college-level work and careers, and to make sure students in different states across the country were learning the similar things in school. Gatsas’ campaign pointed us to several votes Sununu took as an Executive Councilor. The five-member council is charged with approving state contracts over $25,000 and voting on the governor’s judicial and commissioner appointments. In one instance, Sununu voted with the council’s majority to approve a retroactive contract with the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium to test students. That vote was to extend an existing contract with the University of California-Los Angeles for $603,000 to develop the Smarter Balanced assessment tests, based on the Common Core standards. Gatsas’ campaign also pointed to Sununu’s confirmation votes for Education Commissioner Virginia Barry and two members of the state’s board of education. Barry was confirmed to another four-year term in 2013 by a unanimous vote. She has been supportive of the standards, saying in 2014 they ""raise the bar in our state with regard to teaching and learning."" So Sununu voted in favor of education officials and a testing contract. This shows a degree of support for Common Core, but these votes are not the same as up or down votes on Common Core itself. Obama’s initiative? Gatsas also ties the initiative to President Obama, a connection Politifact has examined before. Common Core’s website explicitly states that the federal government was not involved in developing the standards. Federal officials did not initiate the state standards for public schools or force them on the states. But they have given states financial incentives to adopt the standards. Claims that Common Core is Obama’s doing have been found False or Mostly False. As PolitiFact Florida noted, the Council of Chief State School Officers -- a national organization of public officials who head state education departments -- discussed developing common standards during its annual policy forum in 2007, a year before Barack Obama won the presidency. The Obama administration has used an education grant process called Race to the Top, to encourage states to use the new standards, but no state is required to adhere to Common Core. Local control While Common Core sets standards, the decisions about what books teachers should use to meet the standards are decisions made at the state and local level. In fact, federal law predating Common Core prohibits ""an officer or employee of the Federal Government to mandate, direct, or control a State, local educational agency, or school’s curriculum..."" So far, 42 states have agreed to use Common Core, with varying degrees of actual support. Minnesota only chose to use the English standards. South Carolina, Indiana and Oklahoma initially agreed to use Common Core, but have since withdrawn. Our Ruling  Ted Gatsas said that Chris Sununu, a fellow Republican, supported ""Obama’s Common Core Agenda."" As an Executive Councilor, Sununu voted in favor of testing contracts and education officials aligned with Common Core, which shows a degree of support, but he has never taken an up-or-down vote on the Common Core standards. And, while Obama’s administration has incentivized states to adopt the standards, the federal government did not develop them, nor do the standards micro-manage how New Hampshire schools should deliver education. This statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/sep/12/ted-gatsas/republican-candidate-governor-ted-gatsas-says-oppo/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Mike Pence']","
Mike Pence says 'no effort' made against visa overstays
","Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence says that in addition to deporting undocumented criminals and strengthening the border, the United States should be tougher about removing people who overstay their visas. ""An enormous number of people come to this country legally and then simply overstay their visas because we make no effort to hold them accountable to that or uphold the law,"" Pence said Sept. 4 on NBC’s Meet the Press. People who have overstayed their visas account for a large portion of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, about 40 percent by some estimates. Are government officials really making no efforts against people who overstay their visas, or to uphold the law? Pence’s team guided us to a June Washington Times article that says immigration officials ""catch an abysmally small percentage of the illegal immigrants who arrived on visas but overstayed their welcome."" The article attributes that factoid to an admission of immigration authorities. But there is more to the story. Enforcement priorities U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement does go after visa violators, but the agency prioritizes violent undocumented immigrants. The agency’s top focus is the removal of people convicted of violent crimes, such as murder and rape, ICE spokesperson Dani Bennett said via email. People who overstay their visas but don’t pose a threat to national security, public safety or border security fall into ICE’s second priority. The conservative-leaning Washington Times reported that at least 480,000 people didn’t leave the country as expected in fiscal year 2015. Immigration officials investigated just 10,000 of these cases and arrested fewer than 2,000 because, as the Times reported, ""the others don’t rise to the level of being priority targets."" The article was based on a June 2016 House Homeland Security Committee hearing on overstays. Homeland Security Department officials testified that out of the nearly 10,000 leads pursued: about 4,100 cases were closed for being in compliance; at least 3,000 were under current investigation; 1,910 were arrested, and the rest were under ""continuous monitoring and further investigation as appropriate."" ICE data shows that out of a total 235,413 removals in fiscal year 2015, about 18,500 were second-priority removals. There’s no breakdown of how many of those were visa overstays (that category also includes those convicted of drug-related crimes, unlawful possession or use of firearm and other misdemeanors). Indefinite number of overstays Immigration officials and scholars say not much is known about legal immigrants who overstay their visa, so they rely on estimates. In 2006, Pew Research Center said visa overstays could make up at least 4 million of the population here illegally, roughly one-third of that population. The first legal requirement for an entry-exit system came in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. It took about 20 years before DHS released its first ever Entry/Exit Overstay Report, though it only contained information for fiscal year 2015. Almost 45 million people were expected to leave in fiscal year 2015, the report said, and about 98.8 percent did so on time. About 482,700 were still in the country by Sept. 30, 2015, the end of the 2015 fiscal year. That dropped to 416,500 by Jan. 4, 2016. Overstay consequences While DHS devotes less enforcement resources to visa overstays than it does to border enforcement, violators are still apprehended and removed, said Donald M. Kerwin, executive director of the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank studying international migration. Undocumented immigrants also are not eligible for most public benefits, said Robert Warren, an expert on immigration and senior visiting fellow at the center. People who overstay their visas and become undocumented may also face limitations when applying for jobs. The Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986 forbids employers from knowingly hiring people who are not authorized to work in the United States. If they leave and want to come back, they may be disqualified from getting a visa and not be let in, said Lazaro Zamora, a Bipartisan Policy Center senior policy analyst. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, unlawful presence for more than 180 days is punishable by a 3-year bar against re-entering, and unlawful presence of one year or more is punishable by a 10-year ban, Zamora said.

Pence’s statement suggests there are no repercussions for people who overstay their visa. While they are not ICE’s top concern — officials say they prioritize the removal of convicted criminals over visa violators— they can still be deported and barred from coming back into the United States. About 8 percent of the 235,413 people removed from the country in fiscal year 2015 belonged to a category that includes visa overstays.  We rate Pence’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2016/sep/12/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-theres-no-effort-against-visa-over/

Bloggers hype Hillary Clinton health poll as a representative survey of all doctors; it's not
","Hillary's Clinton's physician said she's in good overall health, but that hasn't quelled speculation on the internet and elsewhere about the fitness of the Democratic nominee for president. That speculation was reinvigorated Sept. 11, 2016, when Clinton faltered while prematurely leaving a public event and her campaign revealed she had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier. In most cases, pneumonia is a short-term health problem. But on Sept. 8, three days before that illness came to light, a series of headlines surfaced on the Drudge Report, InfoWars and other conservative-leaning sites which typically reported that ""71 percent of doctors say Hillary's health concerns are 'serious' and 'could be disqualifying.'"" The sites used words like ""Bombshell poll"" and ""Shock Poll!"" At first blush, that sounds like a strong physician consensus. As it turns out, it's not 71 percent of doctors at all. It's 71 percent of doctors on the email list of a small conservative/libertarian medical group. In our previous reporting on the health of both Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump, we’ve noted the folly of trying to diagnose a candidate's physical or mental health without actually examining that candidate. In mental health circles, it's considered unethical. The poll being cited by the bloggers is based on a two-day online survey begun Sept. 5 by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a Tucson-based organization with a largely conservative or libertarian membership that's concerned about the intrusion of government into medicine. The AAPS spent decades trying to block the implementation of Medicare, according to documentation on its website, and it opposes Obamacare. It has publicized the discredited ideas that vaccines can cause autism and abortion increases the risk of breast cancer. The group claims about 5,000 members. To give that some perspective, the American Medical Association, the nation's largest, reported 224,503 members in 2012. When we contacted AAPS, executive director Dr. Jane Orient and the group's webmaster and business manager, Jeremy Snavely, said the email invitation to participate in the Survey Monkey poll went to 3,700 known physicians on its email list. The email was opened by 1,050 people; 250 responded during the two-day window. Orient said the six-question survey was simply designed to see how its members felt about allegations made about Clinton's health. It was not an attempt to survey a representative sample of physicians, which would have been prohibitively expensive, she said. In response to the second question, 91 percent said they were aware ""of questions raised about the impact of past and current medical conditions on Hillary Clinton's fitness to serve as President."" In the fourth question, 71 percent said their ""impression about the concerns"" was ""Serious — could be disqualifying for the position of President of the U.S."" And in the fifth question, asked if they were aware of health issues Clinton had reported in the past and, in the final question, 73 percent said that any of those health issues would influence their vote for president. The poll was poorly designed. For example, in Question 4, 21 percent said the concern was ""likely overblown."" But to give that answer, a doctor had no choice but to agree with the statement that the concerns ""should be addressed as with full release of medical records."" The survey did not ask about each respondent's medical specialty, so the evaluations of neurologists, who might have better training on concussion issues, were lumped together with the responses of gynecologists. It did not ask the respondents if they had read the letter from Clinton's doctor asserting she had fully recovered from her 2012 concussion and blood clot in the brain or inquire where they had gotten their information on Clinton's health. And the survey did not ask comparable questions about Trump, whose doctor did not offer as much detail as Clinton's doctor and, instead, boasted that, if elected, Trump ""will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency."" Orient, who designed the survey, said it was not asking members to diagnose Clinton. ""We were just asking whether they thought the concerns that had been raised were serious or not,"" she said. She said members weren't asked about Trump because he hasn't been accused of having serious physical problems. The AAPS news release makes no reference to only offering the survey to its members, so it’s not entirely surprising that the bloggers would omit this detail, too. When we asked Orient about that significant omission, she said via email, ""This is what the press release said: 'Nearly 71 percent of 250 physicians responding to an informal internet survey by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS).' No other claims were made for it."" Our ruling Prior to Clinton's current bout with pneumonia, bloggers reported that ""71 percent of doctors say Hillary's health concerns are 'serious' and 'could be disqualifying.' "" There was no national, scientific poll of doctors. The online poll surveyed physicians on the email list of a very conservative/libertarian medical group, which is significant information missing from the group's news release. The flaws are too serious for this survey to have credibility as an indication of how doctors feel about Hillary Clinton's health and how it affects her ability to be president.

Trump solely blames Obama for doubling of debt
","Donald Trump says this White House is leaving behind a lot of red ink. ""Barack Obama has doubled, during his fairly short period of years, he’s doubled our national debt. Doubled it. It’s going to be close to $20 trillion when he leaves,"" Trump told supporters at a Sept. 6 rally in Virginia Beach. Did Obama double the national debt? We checked. The Trump campaign’s press office justified his statement by sending us a link to U.S. Treasury Department figures on the size of the national debt. On Jan. 20, 2009, the day Obama took office, the total national debt stood at $10.6 trillion. On Sept. 6, the day Trump made his statement, it was $19.5 trillion. Over the past year the debt has grown by more than $1 trillion, so Trump’s estimate that the debt will be ""close to $20 trillion"" by the time Obama’s term ends in January is reasonable and is close to doubling the amount from when the president entered office. These indebtedness figures take into account all obligations, including about $5.4 trillion in intergovernmental debt that the U.S. government owes itself, such as the Social Security and Medicare trust funds that are invested in Treasury securities. When looking at the size of the U.S. debt, some experts prefer tallying just the amount of debt held by the public in Treasury bills, savings bonds and obligations to foreign governments, because that’s the debt the government owes to outside entities. But even by that measure, the debt has risen sharply. Public debt this month stands at $14.1 trillion, a figure that’s more than double the $6.3 trillion total when Obama took office. But Trump’s statement implies that Obama is solely to blame for the rise in the debt, and that misses a key part of the story. While Obama proposes spending and signs it into law, all of the spending bill first must pass Congress. In other words, the rise in the debt is not a solo act by Obama. Other factors beyond elected officials’ actions contributed to the debt increase. Robert Bixby, executive director of the centrist Concord Coalition, told our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin in July that given the fact that Obama took office as the Great Recession sapped government revenues, the debt ""would have exploded certainly during (Obama’s) first term, no matter who was president."" Our ruling Trump said Obama ""doubled the national debt. Doubled it. It’s going to be close to $20 trillion when he leaves."" The figures are correct, and we don’t doubt the president shares some of the blame for the increased indebtedness. But Trump’s statement leaves out some key points. First of all, the added debt wasn’t solely the responsibility of Obama; Congress had to approve it as well. And the recession that began before Obama took office in 2009 cut government revenues and led to some of the higher debt incurred during the president’s term.

North Carolina a top state for offshore wind power, state legislator says
","Some lawmakers want to ban wind turbines from much of North Carolina’s soil, citing concerns about interference with the flight paths of military and civilian aircraft. The N.C. Senate approved regulations in June to do just that. The House of Representatives didn’t vote on the regulations. But regardless of whether they are revived and become law in future legislative sessions, some Democrats are already touting opportunities for wind power that aren’t on land. ""NC's coast is possibly the best place in U.S. for an offshore windfarm,"" Rep. Duane Hall of Raleigh tweeted in August, responding to news of an offshore wind farm being built in Rhode Island. ""We need to do this!"" Beachgoers tend to hate the winds that stir up sand and send umbrellas tumbling away. But we wondered whether the energy industry views windy days at the North Carolina coast differently, or whether Hall’s claim was nothing but hot air. Energy potential First, we need to ask whether Hall’s claim is even relevant. It wouldn’t matter how good North Carolina’s potential for offshore wind power is compared with the rest of the country if no one is seriously interested in offshore wind power. Even though it’s a new industry in the U.S., it makes sense for wind power advocates to focus offshore. Winds tend to be stronger and more uniform over water than over land. Several offshore wind farms are in various stages of development, and the federal government wants 20 percent of the country’s power to come from wind by 2030. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, ""offshore wind is a crucial renewable resource to be incorporated in the country's clean energy mix"" because 80 percent of energy use is in coastal states. The federal Bureau of Ocean Energy management has identified three developable sites off the North Carolina coast that contain up to 3,740 megawatts of wind energy potential. That’s nearly twice as much as the solar energy North Carolina produced in 2015, when it ranked third in the nation in solar output. So the potential is there. But is it the best? The best states for wind Hall didn’t respond to our questions asking for evidence backing up his claim. So we looked up various maps and charts on our own, trying to find ""possibly the best place"" for offshore wind energy. A 2010 study by the federal government’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory measured offshore wind power potential in each state. North Carolina ranked fifth behind Hawaii, California, Michigan and Louisiana. Here's a map from the lab:  The study measured total wind power and did not factor how much space would be realistically unusable due to developmental or environmental issues. But taking reality into consideration, Cristina Archer, a University of Delaware professor who studies renewable energy, said North Carolina is ""a pretty awesome state for offshore wind."" While it doesn’t have the most total wind or the highest wind speeds, she said, North Carolina might have the best actual potential due to the geography of the coast. ""I would agree that it is possibly the best in the country, because of the ideal combination of high winds, relatively shallow waters, and a long coastline,"" Archer said. ""Other states, like California, might have higher winds, but the waters are too deep. Or Massachusetts is windier and shallow too, but it does not have the long coastline."" The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management agrees: ""Wind speeds off the Atlantic Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico are lower than wind speeds off the Pacific Coast. However, the presence of shallower waters in the Atlantic makes development more attractive and economical for now."" Factors against North Carolina There are a few reasons why North Carolina might be passed over, however. While North Carolina has more total offshore wind potential than any other East Coast state, some spots in New England have stronger winds. Hurricanes could also scare off some companies. Turbines can only handle winds up to certain strengths, and very fast winds can damage or destroy them. A 2012 study of the risk of hurricane damage in four counties with appealing offshore wind prospects – one each in North Carolina, Texas, New Jersey and Massachusetts – found that the second-riskiest was Dare County, in northeastern North Carolina. The silver lining is that most of the risk in Dare County would be from category 4 and 5 hurricanes. No storm that strong has hit Dare County since at least 1851, when hurricane tracking began. North Carolina as a whole has experienced only one storm that strong – Hurricane Hazel, with category 4 winds, hit southern North Carolina in 1954. Ocean auctions None of the pros or cons matter, however, if companies can’t access the swaths of ocean where they want to build wind farms. The only way to get that access is to lease it from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management at auction. The BOEM has identified three areas in North Carolina for auction – one in Dare County, near Kitty Hawk, and two near Wilmington. The only other such sites in the U.S. are in New York, South Carolina, Hawaii and Oregon. A BOEM spokeswoman said the two Wilmington areas won’t be put up for auction for some time, since they’re being combined with the South Carolina areas. The Kitty Hawk site could be auctioned next year. Our ruling Hall said North Carolina’s coast is ""possibly the best place"" in the country for offshore wind. We appreciate Hall’s use of the word ""possibly."" He’s right to acknowledge some uncertainty. North Carolina has neither the country’s best individual spots for wind power nor the most total potential. But it’s near the top and further benefits from a uniquely long, shallow and uniformly windy coastline that gives it competitive advantages. Since Hall’s claim is accurate but needs additional explanation, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/sep/09/duane-hall/north-carolina-top-state-offshore-wind-power-state/

Ad attacking Patrick Murphy as among 'least effective' in Congress misses the mark
","A conservative organization portrays U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, as a ""fabulously phony failure"" in a TV ad. Murphy is taking on Florida Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio in one of the most closely watched Senate battles in the nation. In the ad, American Future Fund says, ""Patrick Murphy was named one of America's least effective congressmen."" The fund is a political nonprofit organization that does not have to disclose its donors and has spent millions of dollars this election cycle largely attacking Democrats. We will explain the basis of that claim and the shortcomings of the evidence. (The ad also states that Murphy distorted his work record related to being a certified public accountant and small business owner. We have fact-checked similar attacks about his resume .) ‘Faulty analysis’ The ad cites an InsideGov ranking of members of Congress, as well as a Tampa Bay Times blog about the ranking. InsideGov is a product of Graphiq, a technology company that amasses data. We have previously dissected that ranking in a misleading attack by Murphy’s primary opponent, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson of Orlando. Murphy was first elected in 2012. The InsideGov ranking was published in August 2015, and only deals with Murphy’s tenure through 2014. That was when Murphy was a Democratic freshman with little seniority in the Republican-controlled Congress. The tally does not include bills introduced in the current 114th Congress (Jan. 3, 2015-Jan. 3, 2017) since they still have time to pass bills. InsideGov ranked Murphy as the 21st least-effective member. The list is stacked with rookies — 21 of the politicians named ""least effective"" have served four years or less. It’s also overwhelmingly filled with Democrats, the minority party in the House since 2011. The main problem with this ranking is it’s based on a single measure: the percentage of bills sponsored by each member over their time in office that went on to pass committee. That’s not a sufficient way to rate the effectiveness of a member of Congress. Congressional experts have repeatedly told us that there are many other ways to evaluate the effectiveness of a member beyond getting a sponsored bill passed in committee. Members can get language included in other bills, co-sponsor bills, hold hearings, negotiate agreements or provide constituent service (for example, help with getting Social Security benefits). A member might only pass one bill, but it could be a particularly important one. Roy Meyers, a political science professor at the University of Maryland, called the InsideGov analysis ""clickbait garbage."" ""It is a well-known fact that members of the House minority are naturally disadvantaged in having their bills reported by the committees controlled by their opponents,"" he said. Meyers said that among political scientists, the most sophisticated attempt to evaluate legislator effectiveness that has been done recently was created by Craig Volden, a University of Virginia professor, and Alan Wiseman, a Vanderbilt University professor. Their ""Legislative Effectiveness Score"" measures how successful a representative is at moving his or her own bills through different stages of the legislative process, where each of those bills is also coded for its substantive significance. Then the professors compare members to average scores relative to those in a similar party status (majority or minority), level of seniority, and chair position (committee or subcommittee chair). In the 113th Congress, Patrick Murphy scored 0.350. An average minority-party member with his seniority (freshman term) would be expected at 0.391. So Murphy is slightly lower than the average but considered to be close enough. ""So he meets expectations according to our criteria,"" Volden told PolitiFact Florida.    GovTrack, a website that tracks congressional legislation, publishes an annual report card with rankings in various categories rather than just one. For example, it ranked Murphy as No. 2 among House Democrats for writing bipartisan bills in 2015. ""We would never reduce effectiveness to a single number (and we don't generally make value judgments about whether a member is doing a good or bad job),"" said Josh Tauberer, founder of GovTrack. ""InsideGov's analysis demonstrates a total failure to understand how politics works."" Murphy’s campaign pointed to instances of him getting bill language out of a committee as a freshman. In May 2013, Murphy introduced HR 1974, a bill that would have changed how the Small Business Administration gave out loans for businesses rebuilding after a disaster. Instead of being reported out of committee, Murphy’s language was attached to HR 4121 as an amendment along with other SBA-related changes and sent from the Small Business Committee to the House. No action was taken on the bill. In October 2013, Murphy was a cosponsor and co-author of HR 3329, a bill concerning banking regulations. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., was listed as the sponsor, but Murphy’s campaign noted he and Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., managed the bill in the House. In the Congressional Record, Capito credited Murphy for writing the bill with Luetkemeyer. The bill eventually became law. Rubio himself has taken credit for legislative victories by getting language inserted into other bills, so he considers that a measure of effectiveness. His campaign also cited examples of Murphy playing a role in legislation passed during the current session of Congress that wasn’t included in the InsideGov analysis. For example, in April the House unanimously passed the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act introduced by Murphy and U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Fla. The bill will allow competition in the flood insurance marketplace. It hasn’t received a vote in the Senate yet. Our ruling The American Future Fund ad said,""Patrick Murphy was named one of America's least effective congressmen."" This is based on a ranking of one group that narrowly looks at Murphy’s record by only including bills he sponsored that passed out of committee through 2014. Congressional experts have told us that there are multiple ways to influence legislation and be an effective member which aren’t captured by this analysis of only part of his tenure. The ad also omits that as a freshman Democrat, Murphy had little chance of getting legislation through committee. The majority of members on the ""least effective"" list are freshmen Democrats. Another analysis shows that he met expectations for a freshman of the minority party. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d7f3db04-9f93-4463-91ce-ba59c1368983",/factchecks/2016/sep/09/american-future-fund/ad-attacking-patrick-murphy-among-least-effective-/

Hillary Clinton wrongly says it's 'legal' to fire employees for discussing pay 'in most places'
","In June, two Kansas teens were fired from their summer job at a local pizza joint for asking why one of the two — a girl — was getting paid 25 cents less an hour than her male friend, who was doing the same job with the same level of work experience. The manager told the two employees they were being let go because discussing wages is against company policy. This is legal, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said, after telling the teens’ story to an audience in Tampa, Fla. ""And you know what? That's legal,"" she said in her Sept. 6 remarks. ""If you find out about somebody else's salary even if you're doing exactly the same job, you can be retaliated against, including being fired, in most places."" Compensation transparency is a major issue among advocates for gender pay equality — including Clinton, whose platform calls on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, which includes steps intended to increase compensation transparency. But Clinton’s claim is incorrect. Through a patchwork of federal and state laws, most workers in the United States enjoy some sort of protection that makes it illegal for a boss to retaliate against them for discussing pay. ""If we take a snapshot today,"" said David Fortney, a leading employment lawyer in Washington, ""I don’t think it is accurate. The majority of employees do have that protection."" Primarily, there’s the National Labor Relations Act. This 80-year-old law gives most private-sector workers the right to engage in ""concerted activity,"" which means taking action to protect or improve their employment conditions. The National Labor Relations Board specifies ""employees addressing their employer about improving their pay"" as an example of protected activity. The National Labor Relations Board, which administers the law, has regularly found company policies banning employees from talking about their pay to be illegal under this law. For example, the board in 2015 decided that a certain employee policy at T-Mobile was invalid because it restricted employees’ rights to discuss wage and salary information. There are significant limitations to the National Labor Relations Act, however. It doesn’t cover public-sector (government) workers, independent contractors, agricultural laborers, railway or airline workers, people in supervisor positions, or people falling into a few other small categories. Labor and employment experts told us that despite the exceptions, the law still covers most private sector workers. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have pay-transparency laws that go beyond the National Labor Relations Act. In these states, many of the groups not covered by the National Labor Relations Act, such as government employees and supervisors, have the right to discuss their pay without retaliation. As of September 2016, the states include: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont and the District of Columbia. Together, this group makes up about one-third of the entire U.S. population. Then there are additional federal rules covering a few other industries. While the National Labor Relations Act doesn’t cover ""concerted activity"" for certain interstate carriers, such as the rail and air industries, the Railway Labor Act does protect those workers. In April 2014, President Barack Obama signed an executive order that bans any company doing contract work for the federal government from retaliating against employees for discussing their compensation. Additionally, the federal government (as well as many state and local governments) has a formal pay schedule, which means compensation information for different jobs and experience levels are in the public domain already. A worker who is concerned about pay discrimination but doesn’t fall under any of the previously discussed rules might find protection under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race, gender, religion or national origin. It also prohibits employers from retaliating against an employee who speaks out against discriminatory practices. While the language of the law doesn’t specifically protect employees who discuss their wages, it’s reasonable to think it would protect those employees if the discussion pertains to unfair pay discrimination, said Cynthia Estlund, a labor and employment law professor at New York University. She added that the Supreme Court has generally allowed for a broad interpretation of that aspect of Title VII. Given these rules, most workers have some sort of legal right to discuss their pay and raise the issue with their boss. But whether people know they have this right is a different story. Many workplaces have policies — written down or just generally understood — prohibiting employees from discussing pay, despite the fact that this is typically illegal. The Clinton campaign pointed us to a study out of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, in which half of all workers surveyed reported that discussing compensation is either discouraged, prohibited or could lead to punishment. People, including employees, employers and even some labor lawyers, just don’t realize that they have these rights, experts told us. One reason might be that people associate the National Labor Relations Act with union members, even though it applies to workers who aren’t part of a union, too, said William Martucci, a lawyer who represents companies in employment cases. Additionally, some people might consider the punishment for an employer who discourages pay transparency to be so weak as to be ineffective, he said. Companies generally have to give wrongfully terminated employees back pay and the option to take their job back. ""It’s an area fraught with misunderstanding,"" Martucci said. The Paycheck Fairness Act that Clinton supports would, in part, create a universal prohibition on retaliating against an employee for discussing wages. This would bring visibility and uniformity to a legal right that many workers don’t realize they have, but as it stands, most workers already have that legal right. Wait, what happened with the Kansas pizza kids? As for the Kansas pizza restaurant, a Pizza Studio franchise, it seems that the National Labor Relations Act covered the two teens’ right to discuss pay without retaliation, as they were not supervisors. The national chain’s executive director of operations said in a statement that the manager who fired them had a ""misunderstanding"" of company policy. The manager has since been let go. The two teens spoke at the Democratic National Convention in July. Our ruling Clinton said, ""That's legal: If you find out about somebody else's salary even if you're doing exactly the same job, you can be retaliated against, including being fired, in most places."" Under various federal and state laws and regulations, most workers in the United States have the legal right to discuss compensation and raise pay discrimination concerns with their employers. Consequently, employers generally can’t retaliate against an employee for engaging in those discussions. However, the laws are a patchwork, meaning that some small percentage of people could fall through the cracks. And the fact that many people and companies don’t realize what the law says weakens their effect. We rate Clinton’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/sep/09/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-wrongly-says-its-legal-fire-employ/

Mowrer ad misleads on time in Iraq
","Iowa congressional candidate Jim Mowrer has made his military service — both with the Iowa National Guard and as a civilian in the Pentagon — a cornerstone of his campaign. At The Des Moines Register’s Political Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair in August, Mowrer, a Democrat, stumped on veterans’ issues, saying that serving alongside other young Americans is what gives him ""such great hope for the future of our country."" Mowrer is seeking to unseat freshman incumbent U.S. Rep. David Young, a Republican in Iowa’s 3rd District, which includes Des Moines and Council Bluffs. And this week, Mowrer is up with his first television ad of the general election, highlighting his military record and history of service. ""True service is about putting others before yourself,"" the ad's narrator says over images of Mowrer in military uniform. ""That is something Jim Mowrer has always done. After 9/11, Jim put us all first by serving for 23 months in Iraq, the war’s longest tour."" But, according to military records obtained by The Des Moines Register through a Freedom of Information Act request, Mowrer served one year, three months and 18 days of foreign service in Iraq — or about 16 months. His campaign insists the ad is not misleading because his unit was deployed for 23 months, which included more than six months of training in Mississippi before departing to Iraq. ""Anybody who's involved in the military or is a veteran doesn’t parse between the time spent here training or in Iraq,"" said campaign manager Andrew Mulvey. ""It’s all one deployment."" Col. Greg Hapgood, director of public affairs for the Iowa National Guard, declined to comment about Mowrer or the ad specifically. But he said there is a distinction between a ""mobilization"" or a ""deployment,"" which includes time when soldiers are called up to active duty but may be training in the United States, and being ""in country"" with boots on the ground in a foreign combat zone. ""I think from a technical sense, if an individual is going to talk about their service and to be honest about that service, you’d need to differentiate between the total mobilization time and the time that was spent whether in training here in the U.S. or actually once you left the U.S. and went overseas into combat theater,"" he said. ""It is somewhat of a technicality, but if someone’s going to be honest about their service, that’s the correct way to characterize it.""  Mowrer enlisted in the National Guard in 2003 and served for six years. He was part of a unit that was mobilized and deployed in the fall of 2005 to fight terrorism in Iraq. According to a press release issued by the Iowa Army National Guard upon the unit’s return, the Iowans were mobilized in September and October of 2005 and were sent to Camp Shelby in Mississippi. After additional training, they were deployed to Iraq in March and April of 2006. While in Iraq, Mowrer served as an intelligence analyst with the ""Ironman Battalion,"" which was tasked with convoy security on the western region of the Iraqi theater of operations. In January 2007, the U.S. Department of Defense announced an extension of that deployment from 12 months in Iraq to 16 months as part of the military's ""surge."" The unit, which was in fact the longest-deployed unit of the Iraq War according to a congressional resolution, returned to Iowa in July and August of 2007, and Mowrer ended his service honorably in 2009 without being redeployed. He returned to Iraq as a civilian analyst and adviser to the commander of U.S. forces later that year. According to military records, Mowrer was mobilized from October 2005 through August 2007 — almost 23 months. According to his discharge papers, he served one year, three months and 18 days of foreign service, or about 16 months. Our ruling The ad claims Mowrer served ""for 23 months in Iraq, the war’s longest tour."" It’s true that Mowrer’s unit was deployed for 23 months, the longest continuous deployment of the Iraq War. But the ad says Mowrer ""served in Iraq for 23 months,"" which is not accurate. Mowrer served in Iraq for about 16 months.   Being deployed, which can include training in the United States, is different from being ""in country,"" with boots on the ground of a foreign nation.  We rate this claim Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2016/sep/09/jim-mowrer/fact-check-mowrer-ad-misleads-military-record/

The former secretary of state did speak at a minority journalists convention in August, but that does not account for her dedicated press corps, so we rated Trump’s claim Mostly True. (After our fact-check appeared, Hillary Clinton did hold one, and arguably several, events that would qualify as press conferences.) But we were curious -- has Clinton failed to address immigration when asked about it? Multiple instances  We did not hear back from Trump’s press office, but we found several instances in which Clinton answered questions about how she would handle immigration as commander in chief. Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin provided us with multiple examples, the most recent being a Q&A during the minority journalists convention. Clinton’s first question at the event, according to Time Magazine’s transcript, was about immigration. Lori Montenegro, National Correspondent for Telemundo, asked Clinton to ""walk us through"" the steps of how she planned to achieve her well-known promise of proposing an immigration bill in her first 100 days as president. ""How will you get immigration reform, something that President Obama was not able to do,"" Montenegro asked, ""so that Latinos can believe that something is going to happen, that their vote, again, is not being taken for granted considering that the House, at least the House, will remain under Republican control?"" Clinton’s answer was, essentially, that she hoped the Democrats retake the Senate and force the House to vote on a bipartisan bill. ""I want this to be a clear, high priority for my administration. We will be prepared to introduce legislation as quickly as we can do so,"" Clinton said. ""I am hoping that the outcome of the election, which I am working hard to ensure a victory, will send a clear message to our Republican friends that it’s time for them to quit standing in the way of immigration reform."" That example alone is enough to disprove Trump’s claim. But we found more examples of Clinton explaining her immigration position in interviews and debates. During a March Democratic primary debate in Miami with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Univision’s Jorge Ramos repeatedly asked Clinton whether she would deport certain types of undocumented immigrants. From the transcript: Ramos: ""So you will stop those deportations."" Clinton: ""I would stop…"" Ramos: ""The deportations for children…"" Clinton: ""Yes."" Ramos: ""... and those who don't have a criminal record."" Clinton: ""Of the people, the undocumented people living in our country, I do not want to see them deported. I want to see them on a path to citizenship. That is exactly what I will do."" Clinton also sat down with Vox editor Ezra Klein in June. He asked her several questions on immigration, including whether more documented immigrants would help America’s economy. ""I think we have to look at all of these issues -- comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship would deal with a lot of these concerns, not just the 11 million people here: how we would regularize them, what kind of steps they’d have to go through,"" Clinton said. ""Because I believe they do have to meet certain standards if they’re going to be on a path to citizenship."" Clinton also took some media questions when she visited the Jackson Diner, an Indian buffet in the immigrant-heavy Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, N.Y., on April 4, 2016. A transcript can be found here. And, there are several examples dating back to last year, including a October 2015 interview with Telemundo in which Clinton told María Celeste Arrarás about a 100-day timeline to review immigration. ""I want to see comprehensive immigration reform.  And I'm going to do everything I can as soon as I get into office to push on that,"" Clinton said. We have written about Clinton’s immigration plan previously. It calls for encouraging immigrants to become citizens, changing detention policies and using legislation to create a path to citizenship for the undocumented population. Our ruling Trump said Clinton has ""not answered a single question"" about her immigration plan. We quickly found several instances of Clinton answering multiple questions about her immigration plan. Trump’s claim is ridiculous and unfounded. We rate it Pants on Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a8442017-8c71-4a56-b3f6-4313e6db605c",/factchecks/2016/sep/09/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-hillary-clinton-has/
