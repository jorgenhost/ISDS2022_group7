No, Biden wasn’t photographed sleeping at his Oval Office desk

","""AMERICA IN DECLINE,"" begins a description of a photo of what looks like President Joe Biden asleep at his desk in the Oval Office with a caption that describes him as a ""decrepit old grifter"" who ""works MAYBE five hours a day."" But the photo, which is spreading widely on social media, appears to be doctored. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The original photo appears to be an image used by some news organizations reporting on the executive orders Biden signed on his first day in office.  In this version of the photo, Biden’s hands appear on the desk as they do in the image being shared on social media. There is also a stack of executive orders sitting next to him and he’s wearing the same blue suit and tie. Only in the original, he’s also wearing a black face mask and looking up, eyes open. Video footage from that day shows the president wearing a mask, signing orders and speaking to the reporters as cameras can be heard clicking in the background.  We found nothing to support the allegation that he was caught and photographed sleeping at his desk.  The public schedule the Biden transition team released for Jan. 20, the day that picture was taken, began with an 8:45 a.m. church service and ended with a 9:55 p.m. appearance by Biden and the first lady on the Blue Room Balcony. The president’s public schedule is available online. While it doesn’t detail his every move on a given day, it shows Biden working full days with events slated for the mornings, afternoons and evenings.

How many DACA recipients are essential workers amid COVID-19 pandemic?
","For two decades, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., has advocated for passing the Dream Act to grant legal status to certain immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. As he made his case for the 2021 version of the bill, Durbin cited the role of these immigrants as workers in essential sectors. ""In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 200,000 DACA recipients are essential infrastructure workers,"" Durbin said during a Feb. 4 Senate floor speech, referring to the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed these immigrants to stay in the country without fear of deportation. ""That’s not my term — that is the definition of the Department of Homeland Security under President Donald Trump,"" Durbin said. ""Among these essential workers are 41,700 DACA recipients in the healthcare industry: doctors, intensive care nurses, paramedics, respiratory therapists — all of them in a suspended immigration status because (the) Dream Act is still a bill, not a law."" The number of DACA recipients who hold essential jobs during the pandemic has been a talking point for months among advocates of protecting these immigrants from deportation. A few think tanks — including one cited by Durbin — have tried to estimate their numbers, using varying criteria. Their estimates range from the tens of thousands to as many as 361,000. For two decades, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have crafted versions of legislation, sometimes called the Dream Act, that would offer a path to citizenship for immigrants who came here illegally as children. But despite bipartisan enthusiasm in Congress, the bills have stalled.  In 2012, the Obama administration created DACA as an administrative program to protect these immigrants from deportation, as long as they reapplied every two years and met certain requirements. The Trump administration tried to rescind the program, but encountered legal hurdles. On his first day in office, President Joe Biden issued a memorandum directing federal officials to preserve DACA. There were about 641,000 active DACA recipients as of September. Durbin and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., introduced the Dream Act of 2021 to allow certain immigrants to earn lawful permanent residence and eventually citizenship if they meet conditions, including passing background checks, and pursue higher education, work lawfully for at least three years, or serve in the military. Durbin’s spokesperson said his statistics about essential workers came from an April 2020 report about the demographics of DACA recipients by the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy research and advocacy organization. CAP drew from a March 2020 memo by the DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency identifying essential critical infrastructure workers during the pandemic.  The analysis by CAP included workers in health care, education and food-related jobs, although CISA’s list also included jobs in other areas such as transportation. CAP also drew on its own analysis of Census data to estimate how many people were DACA recipients, and looked at Bureau of Labor Statistics occupational classifications to come up with its employment numbers. ""Across the country, 202,500 DACA recipients are working to protect the health and safety of Americans as the country confronts COVID-19,"" the report stated. ""They are ensuring that children are still being educated; food is still being grown, packaged, cooked, shipped, and put on the shelves of grocery stores; patients are being cared for; and much more."" CAP found that 29,000 DACA recipients are frontline health care workers, while an additional 12,700 work in the healthcare industry as custodians, food preparers ormanagers, among other jobs. Durbin arrived at his figure of 41,700 by adding those two groups.  We sent the CAP report to the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for low levels of immigration. Steve Camarota, the group’s director of research, said that some of those CAP counted as health care workers are not on the frontlines of the pandemic, such as dental assistants or technologists or technicians for veterinarians or ophthalmologists. ""Honorable work to be sure, but not vital to fighting COVID,"" Camarota said. CAP said its analysis includes 6,000 health technologists or technicians, including dietetic technicians, pharmacy technicians, psychiatric technicians, surgical technologists, veterinary technologists and technicians, and ophthalmic medical technicians. But CAP’s numbers aren’t out of line with other groups that have come up with estimates of DACA recipients who work in essential industries: The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, concluded that there were between 72,000 and 361,000 essential workers among DACA participants in 2020. The range is based on various definitions of essential industries. The Center for Migration Studies, a nonpartisan think tank devoted to studying international migration, concluded there were about 43,500 DACA recipients in health care and social assistance industries and tens of thousands in other essential industries including transportation, warehousing, retail, manufacturing and waste management. The New American Economy, a bipartisan group of mayors and business leaders that seeks an overhaul of national immigration policy, found there were 62,600 DACA-eligible individuals in healthcare. Durbin said ""More than 200,000 DACA recipients are essential infrastructure workers"" including ""41,700 DACA recipients in the healthcare industry."" Durbin was drawing from an April 2020 report from the liberal Center for American Progress. The statistics come with some caveats, including that they are estimates and include a broad swath of workers in healthcare, including some who aren’t on the front lines of treating COVID-19 patients. Even so, the numbers he cited are lower than some estimates by other groups. We rate this statement Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280972E1580>],/factchecks/2021/feb/09/richard-durbin/how-many-daca-recipients-are-essential-workers-ami/

Can Pfizer and Moderna end the pandemic by sharing their vaccine designs? It's not that simple
","Vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna earned praise for creating highly effective COVID-19 vaccines in record time. But are they inadvertently hurting the public by not sharing their technology with other pharmaceutical companies to help speed up vaccine manufacturing and distribution? That’s what one post circulating on social media claims. ""The vaccine shortage doesn’t need to exist,"" reads an image of a tweet shared thousands of times on Facebook. ""Pfizer and Moderna could share their design with dozens of other pharma companies who stand ready to produce their vaccines and end the pandemic."" In short, the situation is not that simple. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This tweet doesn’t mention that the two pharmaceutical companies are already partnering with other firms to produce the vaccine. It also makes it appear as if dozens of companies are regulated to make vaccines and have a ready supply of the raw materials, equipment and storage needed to efficiently and effectively produce them. Experts say that’s not the case. When PolitiFact reached out to the tweet’s author, Dr. James Hamblin, a public health policy lecturer at Yale University and writer at The Atlantic, he acknowledged that using the words ""stand ready"" in the tweet inaccurately implied the process could begin immediately. ""It takes time and investment to begin making mRNA vaccines,"" Hamblin told PolitiFact. ""The companies would need the assurance that they not lose money by getting into that space, possibly in some way similar to the assurances given during the research phase of warp speed.""  Both Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines rely on newer messenger RNA technology. (It has been studied for some time, but hasn’t been used in a vaccine until now.) The mRNA is fragile and needs to be handled carefully, with specific temperatures and humidity levels to keep it from breaking down.  It’s highly unlikely, experts say, that ""dozens"" of manufacturing plants have the capability to get this type of production off the ground immediately. Even if Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna made their vaccine designs open source today, pharmaceutical researchers estimate that it would still take several months for other companies to produce the shots, and by then mass distribution and inoculation will be well underway.  PolitiFact reached out to both companies for comment but did not hear back. Dr. Rajeev Venkayya — president of the Global Vaccine Business Unit at Takeda Pharmaceuticals and former director of vaccine delivery at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Global Health Program — wrote a Twitter thread addressing the complexity and risk of vaccine manufacturing. Among many issues, Venyakka said that vaccines are complex biologics and it’s hard to predict whether changes to the manufacturing process will impact vaccine efficacy or safety. ""Many vaccines are made by growing viruses in cells, and when that doesn’t happen as expected, it can lead to losses in production and delayed timelines. This is an area where cell- and virus-free mRNA vaccine production has a major advantage,"" Venkayya wrote.  ""For these reasons, every aspect of vaccine manufacturing is tightly controlled: raw materials, equipment, production processes, training, operating procedures etc. All of it happens under GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) regulations, and facilities are regularly inspected.""  THREAD: Vaccine ManufacturingBack in October, I said the Warp Speed timelines were extraordinarily optimistic given the inherent risks of vaccine development, manufacturing and distribution. All of those risks and others have materialized. 1/https://t.co/OOlGxPBnox pic.twitter.com/RwCzkljdDS According to the Food and Drug Administration, manufacturers may share any information or data about their products as they choose, as they are the owners of the information. But the firm is responsible for ensuring that any contract manufacturer is in compliance with the FDA’s good manufacturing practice regulations. These rules establish minimum requirements for the methods, facilities and controls used in making and packing pharmaceuticals. They aim to ensure that a product is safe for use, and that it has the ingredients and strength it claims to have. John Grabenstein, associate director for scientific communications at the Immunization Action Coalition — a vaccine information organization that works in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention —  told PolitiFact the tweet wrongly presumes that the companies aren’t already outsourcing production. Grabenstein tracks the partnerships between pharmaceutical firms and contract manufacturers.  He said that Pfizer-BioNTech is currently working with bio-pharmaceutical companies Rentschler and Polymun, while Moderna has partnered with Rovi, Recipharm and Lonza. Some of the companies are located entirely overseas, while others have plants in the U.S.  Typically, the contractors are doing one of the major portions of production, Grabenstein said, such as manufacturing the bulk product, formulation of the bulk into the final preparation, filling the drug product into vials, or finishing the final packaging which could include labeling vials, inserting them and paperwork into boxes and assembling boxes for a carton. For example, Rovi, one of the companies working with Moderna, signed a contract in July 2020 to start filling and packaging 100 million doses of the vaccine in early 2021. In fewer cases, a full-fledged manufacturer is commissioned to make a mirror image of the original product, from start to finish.  One example of this is the Serum Institute of India — the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer — which is already producing a parallel version of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine that the institute will market with the trade name CoviShield. The institute launched construction of new facilities back in June 2020 to make it happen. The organization recently announced a similar partnership with Novavax.  ""This is incredibly intricate and the number of facilities and trained personnel is really, really small,"" Grabenstein said. ""It’s not like you’re just giving a recipe to another restaurant. That ‘recipe’ is thousands and thousands of pages long, and then you have to validate and show that you meet all the really tight performance specifications and prove consistency of process before any of the regulators will let you distribute any of the vaccine."" Hamblin, the author of the Twitter post, said it’s unlikely that the companies would share their vaccine designs, given the current system of intellectual property and funding, though he noted exceptions, like Sanofi. Sanofi, a French multinational pharmaceutical company, announced in January that it entered into a partnership with BioNTech, the firm that co-developed the vaccine with Pfizer. Sanofi said it will provide the firm access to its ""established infrastructure and expertise to produce over 125 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine in Europe."" Initial supplies will originate from Sanofi’s production facilities in Frankfurt from summer of 2021. Hamblin noted that if vaccine makers open the intellectual property in a permanent, unconditional way — rather than on a small scale for a finite period — it could help get more companies and governments into the production ""in a more permanent, cost-effective way.""  ""If we have to manufacture boosters in specific areas for new strains, for example, or for the next coronavirus, we could be on it right away,"" Hamblin said. ""Again, speaking hypothetically about that — not implying it will happen or would be quick or easy or anything else."" With President Joe Biden invoking the Defense Production Act, couldn’t that serve to help speed things up? Yes, but it’s not as sweeping as some think.  The Defense Production Act of 1950 gives presidential authority to promote national defense by expediting and expanding the supply of materials and services from the U.S. industrial base. George Siber, a vaccine expert who is on the advisory board of CureVac, a German mRNA vaccine company, told Kaiser Health News that invoking the act would allow the government to commandeer an appropriate plant to expand production, but said it would still take about a year to get going. Companies would first have to undertake a thorough cleaning of their equipment and facilities to prevent cross-contamination and would need to set up, calibrate and test equipment, and train scientists and engineers to run it, Siber told KHN. ""Do you want glass? Aluminum? Filter resins? What is the thing that you need?"" Grabenstein said. ""For example, vaccine manufacturers say, ‘if only I had more glass vials, I could increase my weekly production.’ Ok, the government gets you more glass vials. Then it reveals the next bottleneck."" He added: ""Is there production that could be stopped or delayed, and let those machines be used for this goal? Sure, but you still have to clean it, and quality control that it’s really clean, and then the transfer and validation of process. It’s months or years of commitment. This is not turn-on-a-dime kind of stuff.""  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 59 million doses of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines had been distributed and roughly 41 million administered by the second week in February. This shows that the U.S. has vaccinated 9.5% of the population, putting it about fifth in the world, according to a tracker maintained by The New York Times.  A post claims the COVID-19 vaccine shortage doesn’t need to exist because Pfizer and Moderna can share their vaccine designs with ""dozens"" of other pharmaceutical companies that are ready to produce the vaccines and end the pandemic. This premise oversimplifies the vaccine manufacturing process. First, the post doesn’t mention that Pfizer and Moderna already have partnerships with various contract manufacturers to help speed up vaccine production. Second, industry experts say it’s highly unlikely that ""dozens"" of other pharmaceutical companies that aren’t already producing the vaccines stand ready to do so. Supplies, personnel training and facility compliance are just a few aspects that make the process complex and lengthy. So while such partnerships are clearly an asset to rapid vaccine production, they are not entirely practical in the grand sense that this tweet implies. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CE8D00>],/factchecks/2021/feb/09/facebook-posts/can-pfizer-and-moderna-end-pandemic-sharing-their-/

No, Dr. Anthony Fauci did not fund research tied to COVID-19 ‘creation’
","Editor’s note, May 17, 2021: When this fact-check was first published in February 2021, PolitiFact’s sources included researchers who asserted the SARS-CoV-2 virus could not have been manipulated. That assertion is now more widely disputed. Read our May 2021 report for more on the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19. That dispute notwithstanding, the claim that COVID-19 was created with research funded by Dr. Anthony Fauci remains False. More than a year after the coronavirus first arrived in the U.S., conspiracy theories continue to spread about a virology lab in Wuhan, China, which has drawn scrutiny throughout the pandemic for research it conducted on bat viruses.  One new claim about the lab comes from conservative news site WorldNetDaily, which tried to connect Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health, to the origin of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  ""New evidence ties COVID-19 creation to research funded by Fauci,"" reads the headline. Despite its promise of ""new evidence,"" the WorldNetDaily article largely resembled other conspiracy theories that we have fact-checked in the past. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As evidence of its claims, the article cited an investigation by Fox News commentator Steve Hilton, who claims that the coronavirus was created at the Wuhan lab with NIH grant money.  Although the NIH did fund a project at the Wuhan lab, there’s no proof that the coronavirus was bioengineered. Both the WorldNetDaily article and Hilton’s segment rely on a series of unsubstantiated allegations to spin a conspiracy theory about the virus being a lab creation. WorldNetDaily has since dialed back on many of its claims, issuing three separate corrections, all of which cite scientists pushing back on the notion that SARS-CoV-2 was manmade. It has also placed a question mark at the end of the original headline. However, the bulk of the article text has not been updated. In 2014, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, the part of the NIH headed by Fauci, awarded a $3.4 million grant to the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance, which aims to protect people from viruses that jump from species to species. The alliance has projects across 30 countries, including Thailand, Vietnam and China.  The group hired the virology lab in Wuhan to conduct genetic analyses of bat coronaviruses collected in Yunnan province, about 800 miles southwest of Wuhan. EcoHealth Alliance paid the lab $598,500 over five years. The lab had secured approval from both the U.S. State Department and the NIH.  That the NIAID funded the project is not in question. However, the WorldNetDaily article goes further than that, claiming that the grant covered ""gain of function"" research on a bat coronavirus, which ""created"" SARS-CoV-2.  Gain-of-function research is a controversial form of study that involves boosting the infectivity and lethality of a pathogen. Proponents of gain-of-function say it helps researchers spot potential threats to human health and allows them to figure out ways to tackle a new virus. Fauci has advocated for gain-of-function research in the past. In a 2011 article he co-wrote for the Washington Post, he promoted it as a means to study influenza viruses.  However, there’s no hard proof to support the article’s claims about gain-of-function research. The overwhelming consensus among public health experts is that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 evolved naturally.  All parties involved in the grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology have denied that it involved gain-of-function research.  ""We have not ever participated in gain-of-function research. Nor have we ever been funded to participate in gain-of-function research,"" Robert Kessler with the EcoHealth Alliance told PolitiFact last May.  The NIH told us: ""The research supported under the grant to EcoHealth Alliance Inc. characterized the function of newly discovered bat spike proteins and naturally occurring pathogens and did not involve the enhancement of the pathogenicity or transmissibility of the viruses studied.""  The grant was approved in May 2014. Five months later, on Oct. 17, the Obama administration announced it would not fund new projects that involved gain-of-function research, citing safety and security risks.  The NIH told us that it reviewed the EcoHealth Alliance project after the funding pause and determined that it did not involve gain-of-function research. As a result, it was not affected by the White House’s new policy. Hilton and WorldNetDaily do not provide evidence that the grant covered gain-of-function research. When we reached out to Fox News, a spokesperson pointed us to the transcript of Hilton’s segment. Art Moore, the author of the WorldNetDaily article, did not respond to a request for comment.  MIT biologist Kevin Esvelt reviewed a paper that appears to have been published with financial assistance from the grant. According to Esvelt, certain techniques that the researchers used seemed to meet the definition of gain-of-function research. But he told PolitiFact that ""the work reported in this specific paper definitely did NOT lead to the creation of SARS-CoV-2"" because the genetic sequences of the virus studied in the paper differ from that of the new coronavirus.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and the NIH have all said that the virus was not derived from a lab.  If the virus had been altered in a lab, its genomic data would show signs of tampering. Although scientists from around the world have publicly shared the virus’ genetic makeup thousands of times, there’s still no evidence that the virus was bioengineered.  On Feb. 19, 2020, public health experts signed a public statement to ""strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin."" ""Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes"" of SARS-CoV-2 ""and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife,"" the statement reads, citing nine scientific studies.  A detailed computational analysis of the coronavirus conducted by five researchers in March found that its genetic makeup showed no signs of alteration. The ability of the virus to bind to human cells is most likely the result of natural selection in an animal host or in humans after the virus jumped from animals.  ""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,"" the researchers wrote. There are unresolved concerns that a protective lapse at the lab could have allowed a natural virus to escape, but there is no hard proof of such a lapse.  WorldNetDaily wrote that ""New evidence ties COVID-19 creation to research funded by Fauci."" Both the NIH and EcoHealth Alliance have denied that a grant to the Wuhan lab funded gain-of-function research, though a scientist told us that one paper published with assistance from the grant seems to describe techniques similar to gain-of-function.  The CDC, the WHO, and the NIH have all said that the virus that causes COVID-19 evolved naturally. There is no evidence to support that claim that it was created by researchers.  This claim is False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096960C40>],/factchecks/2021/feb/08/worldnetdaily/no-dr-anthony-fauci-did-not-fund-research-tied-cov/

Scalise’s claim that unauthorized immigrants are getting priority for vaccination misses the point
","During a Feb. 2 interview on Fox News, Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., claimed President Joe Biden was allowing unauthorized immigrants to move ahead of American citizens to get their covid-19 vaccines. ""Now (Biden) is saying that people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other Americans who have been waiting to get the vaccine,"" said Scalise, the No. 2 Republican leader in the House. Lauren Fine, a spokesperson for Scalise, said the representative was referring to a Feb. 1 statement from the Department of Homeland Security. It said the agency ""encourages all individuals, regardless of immigration status, to receive the COVID-19 vaccine once eligible under local distribution guidelines."" Since supply is limited, wrote Fine in an emailed statement, ""for every vaccine an illegal immigrant gets, that’s one an American citizen waiting in line is not getting. If you’re an American citizen that’s currently in a group that can’t get the vaccine yet, you’re now behind in the line to an illegal immigrant in a group that can get one."" Considering the DHS statement, other press statements and executive plans, the Biden administration has certainly been vocal about its position that all immigrants should be able to get this shot. But, we wondered, does allowing this population access to the vaccine mean they are being invited to step in front of American citizens in the queue? We asked the experts. The Biden administration released a national COVID-19 strategy plan during the president’s first week in office. The administration, according to the document, is ""committed to ensuring that safe, effective, cost-free vaccines are available to the entire U.S. public — regardless of their immigration status."" The plan directs federal agencies to take action to ensure everyone living in the U.S. can access the vaccine free of charge and without cost sharing. During a Jan. 28 press briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration feels ""that ensuring that all people in the United States — undocumented immigrants, as well, of course — receive access to a vaccine, because that, one, is morally right, but also ensures that people in the country are also safe."" The DHS statement also specified that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency wouldn’t conduct enforcement operations at or near vaccination sites or clinics. The Biden administration didn’t respond to a request to clarify its position on unauthorized immigrants’ access to vaccines in relation to Scalise’s claim. But, based on publicly available information, it is clear the administration wants immigrants to have access to the vaccine. However, no statement or provision in the administration’s policies indicates they should ""jump"" ahead of other Americans. Public health experts across the board criticized Scalise for his statement, in effect saying he was missing the point. ""The line is not drawn by your immigration or legal status,"" said Dr. Ranit Mishori, senior medical adviser for Physicians for Human Rights, a nonprofit that investigates the health consequences of human rights violations. ""It’s drawn by your vulnerability, your potential for exposure and your risk."" Jeffrey Levi, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University, said Scalise’s claim misrepresents what Biden is trying to do. ""They are simply saying that if an immigrant falls within a category that is currently prioritized (e.g., a health care worker or someone over a certain age), they should not be excluded from getting the vaccine,"" Levi wrote in an email. ""It does not put an immigrant ahead of a prioritized category."" Samantha Artiga, director of racial equity and health policy at Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy organization, had a similar take. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of KFF). ""The policies clarify that all people in the U.S. are eligible for vaccinations regardless of their immigration status and encourage immigrants to get vaccinated when they become eligible based on their local guidelines,"" she wrote in an email. ""They do not prioritize immigrants."" Dr. Jeffrey Singer, a senior fellow in health policy with the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank, said the Biden plan is just following standard public health policy and epidemiological principles. ""Trying to place an emphasis on immigration status might be a good way to press people’s buttons to get a sound bite on television,"" said Singer. ""But immigration status is really irrelevant when we’re prioritizing people. It doesn’t matter where you come from. If you’re here in the U.S., you should get vaccinated."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended in December that states should first prioritize vaccinating health care workers and residents and staff members of long-term care facilities. The next priority group, according to ACIP, should be people ages 75 and older and other front-line essential workers who are not in health care. The Biden administration also recently recommended the age category be lowered to include all seniors, age 65 and older. However, states are free to create their own vaccine distribution plans and decide what groups will get vaccinated first. Unauthorized immigrants make up significant percentages of the workforces deemed ""essential"" by ACIP. For example, KFF reports that noncitizens (a broad group that could include immigrants in the country lawfully) constitute 22% of all food production workers, 8% of workers in long-term care facilities and 5% of health care workers who have direct patient contact. The Migration Policy Institute estimated in a February report the number of unauthorized immigrants who qualify as essential workers ranges from 1.1 million to 5.6 million, depending on how essential workers are defined. The institute also reported about 49% of the estimated 2.4 million farmworkers in the United States were unauthorized immigrants as of 2016. And it’s important those groups get vaccinated regardless of immigration status, not just as a good public health practice, but also from an ethical and humane perspective, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. ""It has obviously been a long-standing public health principle that infection anywhere affects the health of everyone,"" said Benjamin. ""It is also of the highest ethical standards to make sure everybody gets vaccinated and gets treated for infectious disease."" Benjamin added that many unauthorized immigrants who work in essential roles are the foundation keeping society functioning during the pandemic, such as restaurant workers and caretakers. ""They’re at higher risk because they’re out and about and they can’t shelter at home,"" said Benjamin. ""At the end of the day, if we did not vaccinate them and they could not go to work, our economy would totally collapse."" Plus, 70% to 90% of the population needs to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity in the U.S. ""As long as this doesn't happen, it doesn’t matter who is vaccinated,"" said Mishori. ""To reach herd immunity in the U.S., everyone regardless of their immigration status, needs to get vaccinated."" ""Viruses don’t know the legal status of their victims,"" Mishori added. One other note is that the population in question is small compared with the total U.S. population. About 11 million unauthorized immigrants live in the U.S., making up about 3% of the total U.S. population of about 330 million. Scalise said it is Biden’s policy that ""people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other Americans who have been waiting to get the vaccine."" The Biden administration has made it clear that unauthorized immigrants are eligible to receive the vaccine if they are part of a priority group, such as health care workers or seniors. That does mean some unauthorized immigrants who meet specific vaccination criteria for job duties or age could receive a shot before American citizens who do not meet those requirements. This is in keeping with long-standing public health practices. But Scalise was misrepresenting Biden’s policy when he suggested that unauthorized immigrants are being prioritized over American citizens or can jump the vaccination line. Eligibility for the vaccine is based on job and age categories — period. Under the Biden approach, immigration status is not a qualifying or disqualifying factor. His statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

No, a vaping demo doesn’t prove that masks don’t work against COVID-19
","In a video clip being shared on Facebook, a retired anesthesiologist who rails against mask wearing to protect against COVID-19 purports to demonstrate their ineffectiveness by blowing out the vapor from an electronic cigarette. The video carries the headline: ""Doctor proves masks ‘don’t work.’""  But he doesn’t prove that at all. The fact that he can blow vapor through a mask is not evidence that masks don’t protect against passing the coronavirus. After all, people breathe in and out with masks on.  ""By that illogic, the fact that air can pass through a mask could be cited as ‘evidence’ as well,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Cindy Prins, a clinical associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, called the video ""completely misleading."" ""Fabric and surgical/procedure masks are meant to help protect against larger droplet particles that may contain COVID-19,"" she said. ""You have to be able to breathe through a mask, and he is just blowing out water vapor, so that is expected to be able to go through a mask."" The Facebook post that includes the video clip was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The video is by Dr. Ted Noel, a former Florida anesthesiologist. Noel allowed his license to expire in 2014 after deciding to retire, the Florida Department of Health told us.  Noel’s YouTube channel has more than 19,000 subscribers and has had more than 9 million views since it was started in 2016.  In the three-minute clip, Noel blows e-cigarette vapor through a variety of masks, including a surgical-style mask and a cloth mask like those commonly worn to control the spread of COVID-19.  When we asked Noel to back his position, he argued in an email that COVID-19 is spread by aerosols, and that 90% of aerosols and viruses ""go right through"" cloth masks. He also argued that ""basically, the only way droplets can spread COVID-19 is if an ill person happens to be quite close to an uninfected person who happens to be breathing in at the exact moment that the ill person expels the droplets."" Noel has repeatedly railed against masks. On Jan. 31, he wrote: ""Most Americans intuitively recognize that masks don’t reduce infections. But they go along with the virtue signaling to be good citizens."" In his email, he called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious-disease expert, ""a lab rat turned bureaucrat who plays a doctor on TV."" Noel's claims on countering the spread of the coronavirus are contradicted by public health experts. The clip demonstrates that ""to work properly, even the best masks or respirators need to fit properly, without gaps, and not everything that looks like a really good mask necessarily has good filtration,"" said Stephen Morse, professor of epidemiology at the Columbia University Medical Center.  But ""it is a leap to go from there to generalizing that ‘masks don’t work,’"" he said. Many peer-reviewed studies show ""that masks do have a significant effect. They do work, when used properly."" CDC guidance allows that the protection afforded by a mask depends on the type of mask and the nature of the substance in the air — whether it’s liquid droplets, gaseous vapor, or solid particles like soot or pollen. For example, cloth masks that are used to slow the spread of COVID-19 offer little protection against the tiny particles of wildfire smoke, the CDC said when addressing wildfires and COVID-19 in the summer of 2020.  But, as Prins said, it’s the larger respiratory droplets that are the concern with COVID-19. The primary way people get COVID-19 is exposure to respiratory droplets that carry the virus, the CDC reiterated in a research brief in October 2020. The droplets can be transmitted between people through touch or through the air, typically when people are less than 6 feet apart. Measures such as mask wearing, social distancing and hand hygiene ""appear sufficient to address transmission both through close contact and under the special circumstances favorable to potential airborne transmission,"" the brief said.  ""Multi-layer cloth masks block release of exhaled respiratory particles into the environment, along with the microorganisms these particles carry,"" the CDC said in a November 2020 research brief. ""Cloth masks not only effectively block most large droplets, but they can also block the exhalation of fine droplets and particles, also often referred to as aerosols."" The CDC recommends that people wear masks ""in public settings, at events and gatherings, and anywhere they will be around other people"" to slow the spread of COVID-19, because masks provide a barrier that keeps the respiratory droplets from spreading between people. On Jan. 29, the CDC ordered that masks be worn on public conveyances, such as airplanes, subways, buses and cabs, and in transportation hubs such as airports and bus stations. A widely shared Facebook post that includes a video clip claims that a ""doctor proves masks don’t work"" by showing vapor from an electronic cigarette passing through a mask. Experts say the fact that masks allow e-cigarette vapor to pass through provides no evidence to back the claim. They say face coverings offer protection against COVID-19 by blocking larger respiratory droplets, as well as aerosols, that can carry the virus and pass between people. The CDC and other public health experts recommend mask wearing. We rate the claim False.

No, the CDC isn’t inflating coronavirus statistics
","On Feb. 4, U.S. coronavirus deaths exceeded 450,000. According to some social media users, the official death toll can’t be trusted. One blog post shared thousands of times on social media claims official COVID-19 data is being inflated.  ""BUSTED: CDC Inflated COVID Numbers, Accused of Violating Federal Law,"" reads the headline on a National File post. The claim was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post that follows the National File’s headline claims that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has inflated COVID-19 fatality data. ""CDC illegally inflated the COVID fatality number by at least 1,600 percent as the 2020 presidential election played out, according to a study published by the Public Health Initiative of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge,"" the blog post reads. This is not the first time coronavirus death statistics have been the focus of online misinformation. PolitiFact and other fact-checking organizations have debunked prior claims that the CDC decreased the number of coronavirus deaths from 153,504 to 9,210.   And despite what the blog post claims, there is still no evidence to suggest the CDC is inflating coronavirus mortality data.  The study that the blog post points to as its primary evidence was produced by a private group called the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. PolitiFact has previously fact-checked a false claim by the institute’s leader James Lyons-Weiler. A study published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information also debunked Lyons-Weiler’s claim that the virus behind the ongoing pandemic was created in a lab. In this case, the study does not definitively say that the CDC inflated COVID-19 deaths. Rather, it calls into question guidelines the CDC issued in March 2020 that were designed to more accurately capture mortality data related to the coronavirus. The study’s authors called the guidance ""a capricious alteration to data collection has compromised the accuracy, quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of their published data.""  The study’s conclusions are carefully worded (with boldface added by PolitiFact for emphasis):  ""It is concerning that the CDC may have willfully failed to collect, analyze, and publish accurate data used by elected officials to develop public health policy for a nation in crisis [...] If the data being reported was indeed compromised by the CDC’s perplexing decision to abandon proven data collection and reporting practices in favor of untested methods, then all public health policies based upon these inaccurate data must be reexamined.""  Ultimately, the study’s ten authors — at least one of whom is not a medical expert — conclude that ""further federal investigation is justified."" They do not prove or conclude that the CDC inflated COVID-19 death data or violated federal laws. Additionally, experts who study the data say that it is far more likely that official counts of coronavirus deaths are too low.  In April 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, weighed in on the allegation that the coronavirus death toll was being inflated because people were actually dying of other conditions. ""There is absolutely no evidence that that’s the case at all,"" Fauci said in an NBC News interview. ""I think it falls under the category of something that’s very unfortunate — these conspiracy theories that we hear about.""  Fauci went on to say he thought it was possible COVID-19 deaths were being undercounted. ""I think there’s more of a chance of missing some [deaths] that are really coronavirus deaths,"" he said. ""But I don’t think that number is significant enough to really substantially modify the trends that we’re seeing at all."" Roderick Little, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Michigan, told PolitiFact that ""a more reliable picture"" of the coronavirus death toll could be seen by ""looking at excess death rates over historical patterns, as on the same date in previous years."" ""If anything, I'd expect the CDC numbers to be underestimates, not overestimates,"" Little said. ""I note that the lack of testing for COVID early in the pandemic would contribute to such an underestimate."" A blog post headline reads, ""BUSTED: CDC Inflated COVID Numbers, Accused of Violating Federal Law.""  There is no evidence to suggest that the CDC has inflated the number of U.S. coronavirus deaths. In fact, experts agree it is more likely that coronavirus deaths are being undercounted.

"['North Carolina', 'Coronavirus', 'Roy Cooper']","
Cooper exaggerates immediate effect of school reopening bill
","Gov. Roy Cooper says he wants North Carolina school boards to reopen in-person instruction on their own, rather than be forced by state lawmakers. Republican legislators recently introduced a bill that would require county school boards to offer the option of in-person classes.  When a reporter asked Cooper about it during a press conference on Tuesday, he said he hadn’t read the bill yet. ""I haven’t seen the legislation, (but) I know about it,"" Cooper said. ""I have some concerns with it, particularly stripping out some of the health protocols that are in place."" Is it true that the GOP bill would ""strip"" some current safety protocols that are already in place? The bill would strip school boards of flexibility. (They would no longer be allowed to offer remote-only instruction, unless there’s a COVID outbreak.) However, the bill itself does not automatically strip schools of any health protocols for in-person learning.  In North Carolina, Cooper is giving public school boards some flexibility to choose how they want to reopen. He’s laid out three levels of operation: Plan A: minimal social distancing. Plan B: moderate social distancing. Plan C: full remote learning. (There are specific protocols to follow for each plan. For the sake of brevity, we won’t get into those details just yet.) So far, Cooper has given only elementary schools the ability to enact Plan A. Middle and high schools can only choose Plan B or Plan C.  The Republican bill would require all public schools to offer Plan A or Plan B, while allowing parents the ability to still choose a remote alternative. Cooper’s use of the word ""strip"" could give parents the impression the bill would change health protocols that are already in place. The bill does not aim to do that. The bill requires schools to follow protocols laid out in the ""Strong Schools NC Public Health Toolkit"" that was developed by the health department, led by Cooper-appointee Mandy Cohen, as well as the Department of Public Instruction. The original bill told school boards to follow toolkit guidance that ""existed on December 4, 2020."" On Wednesday, the Senate amended the bill to ensure schools follow the latest version of the toolkit, which was updated on Feb. 2.  Cooper said Tuesday that 90 out of North Carolina’s 115 school districts already provide some in-person instruction. Consider for a moment that your school district is already operating under a Plan B model of in-person learning. PolitiFact found no evidence that, if the bill were enacted, health protocols for Plan B would be significantly different from what they are now. Of course, if the bill is enacted and school boards are able to choose Plan A, one could argue that would ""strip"" teachers of existing protections. Plan A and Plan B are similar in some ways. Both require schools to mandate face coverings, conduct regular screenings for coronavirus symptoms, limit visitors, mark the floors to guide movement, and more. (Page 5 of the toolkit features a chart showing how the plans track on 10 out of 11 key guidelines.) However, there are a few protocols required in Plan B that aren’t required under Plan A, including: Mandating 6 feet of physical distance, Banning more than one passenger per bus seat, Restricting carpooling to family members. To be clear, these differences are not insignificant. While in December experts found in-school coronavirus spread to be low, experts have also repeatedly confirmed that social distancing and spacing are key to limiting spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers in-person learning with minimal social distancing to be the highest-risk learning model. On MSNBC this week, the CDC director reiterated that schools can open safely only if they continued social distancing. Cooper said a Republican bill that would require counties to enact in-person learning is ""stripping out some of the health protocols that are in place."" He’s right that the bill would ""strip"" school boards of the ability to offer remote learning exclusively. Also, if the bill is enacted and local school boards opt for Plan A, one could argue that teachers would be stripped of their social distancing protection. However, a parent whose child attends a school operating under Plan B may hear Cooper’s comments and think the Republican bill would remove some health protocols that are already in place. That doesn’t appear to be the case. Bill sponsors say the intention is for schools to continue operating under the guidelines outlined by the Cooper administration. We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809771DE00>],/factchecks/2021/feb/05/roy-cooper/cooper-exaggerates-immediate-effect-school-reopeni/

Donald Trump Jr. wrong that Hillary Clinton is proposing to destroy Medicare
","Speaking at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Donald Trump Jr. touted his father, the newly anointed GOP presidential nominee, as someone who would be able to do a better job on health care than his rival, Hillary Clinton. He said his father would be ""a president who will repeal and replace Obamacare without leaving our most vulnerable citizens without health care, and who will do it without destroying Medicare for seniors, as Hillary Clinton has proposed."" Given how popular the single-payer health care program for seniors is, it was pretty obvious to us that Clinton wouldn’t have put the proposal ""destroy Medicare"" on the issues page of her website. (We were right on that one.) Still, we wondered whether there is any plausible interpretation of her actual Medicare policy proposals in which they could end up ""destroying Medicare for seniors."" We didn’t hear back from the Trump campaign about what Donald Trump Jr. meant, but we took a look for ourselves. First, let’s review Clinton’s agenda for Medicare. On her issues page, the word ""Medicare"" comes up twice. First, Clinton said she would ""explore cost-effective ways to make more health care providers eligible for telehealth reimbursement under Medicare and other programs."" That’s a fairly limited program, as well as relatively non-controversial and unlikely -- even in a worst-case scenario -- to endanger the program’s future, said Sherry Glied, a health policy specialist at New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. The second reference to Medicare on Clinton’s issue page is more sweeping -- to ""support letting people over 55 years old buy into Medicare."" Currently, you need to be 65 to get coverage under Medicare. Under Clinton’s proposal, people up to 10 years younger than that could sign up for the program if they wanted to. Health care experts told PolitiFact that this proposal comes with challenges, but that even if worst came to worst, the idea seems unlikely to jeopardize the program’s continued existence for its core membership of those 65 and older. ""There have been lots of proposals of this type in past and not much concern about the effects on traditional Medicare, assuming premiums are set correctly,"" Glied said. She said the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last analyzed a proposal of this sort in December 2008 and ""raised no concerns about effects on the program as a whole."" A. Bowen Garrett, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute’s health policy center, agreed that the eventual fine print in Clinton’s proposal is going to matter, because in any program that’s optional, there’s a risk that it could attract a relatively small and less healthy pool of beneficiaries who could force premiums upward. Still, Garrett said, ""I do not see why that would necessarily harm the program"" in the way Donald Trump Jr. meant it. Indeed, in the fight to craft the Democratic platform, Clinton’s allies managed to defeat a more sweeping proposal backed by Bernie Sanders to cover all Americans through a Medicare-style single-payer system. After the proposal was defeated, several experts -- including some who are sympathetic to the idea of expanding health insurance coverage --  told Kaiser Health News that the Sanders approach that Clinton defeated was disruptive enough to have actually put the program at risk. ""It’s hard to be nimble"" when a system gets that big, Ezekiel Emanuel, who advised Obama on crafting his signature health care law, told the publication. ""No organization in the world does anything for 300 million people and does it efficiently."" Princeton University health policy expert Paul Starr, a onetime adviser to President Bill Clinton, concurred that ""to try to do it in one fell swoop would be massively disruptive,"" according to Kaiser Health News. Other health care specialists told PolitiFact that Donald Trump Jr.’s statement is vastly overheated. ""There is nothing in her proposals that would destroy Medicare or harm present or future beneficiaries,"" said John Rother, the president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care and the former executive vice president for policy at AARP -- the seniors’ group that would presumably be at most direct risk if Medicare collapsed. Clinton is urging ""changes, yes, quite a few. But nothing that would harm the program or those it serves."" Rena M. Conti, a health policy specialist at the University of Chicago, agreed. ""Nothing I am aware her saying to date would imply that she aims to dismantle the current Medicare program or take away benefits that seniors currently enjoy or bankrupt the trust fund that is used to finance some current Medicare benefits for seniors,"" she said. Our ruling Donald Trump Jr. said Clinton is proposing ""destroying Medicare for seniors."" Clinton is certainly not proposing that in a literal sense, and experts we contacted agreed that her actual policy proposals -- especially making Medicare an option for those between 55 and 65 -- were ambitious but were hardly a dagger at the heart of the program.

What you need to know about Hillary Clinton's 'infamous response' to Benghazi question
","Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who for weeks declined to endorse Donald Trump, called for party unification on the second night of the Republican National Convention against the ""cold, calculated lying"" of Hillary Clinton. Johnson is one of the only vulnerable GOP senators to appear in Cleveland, and he devoted the majority of his short speech to clobbering Clinton. "" ‘What difference, at this point, does it make?' I am the guy that got under her skin and provoked that infamous response from Hillary Clinton by asking a pretty simple question, 'Why didn't you just pick up the phone and call the survivors’ (of the Benghazi attack)?""  Johnson said. ""Instead of doing that, she hatched a cover-up story and repeatedly lied to the American people."" Is that how their exchange unfolded? We found that Johnson is accurately recounting the testimony, but being selective. Clinton’s answer was longer and more nuanced.   During a January 2013 Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Johnson did repeatedly press Clinton about not making contact with Americans in Benghazi to ""ascertain immediately that there was no protest."" Clinton did give her exasperated answer (which has been hashtagged and criticized). ""Ron's questioning from start to finish was about how a simple phone call could have led to the truth — a fact that clearly got under Secretary Clinton's skin just as he described,"" Brian Reisinger, Johnson’s spokesman, told us. But Johnson’s account requires some more context, as Clinton answered the senator’s question twice before her infamous comment. Here is a transcript of their exchange, per PolitiFact Wisconsin, with the parts Johnson highlighted in bold: Johnson: ""Okay, when you read the ARB (State Department Accountability Review Board), it strikes me as how certain the people were that the attacks started at 9:40 Benghazi time. When was the first time you spoke to — or have you ever spoken to — the returnees, the evacuees? Did you personally speak to those folks?"" Clinton: ""I‘ve spoken to one of them, but I waited until after the ARB had done its investigation because I did not want there to be anybody raising any issue that I had spoken to anyone before the ARB conducted its investigation."" Johnson: ""How many people were evacuated from Libya?"" Clinton: ""Well, the numbers are a little bit hard to pin down because of our other friends — "" Johnson: ""Approximately?"" Clinton: ""Approximately, 25 to 30."" Johnson: ""Did anybody in the State Department talk to those folks very shortly afterwards?"" Clinton: ""There was discussion going on afterwards, but once the investigation started, the FBI spoke to them before we spoke to them, and so other than our people in Tripoli — which, I think you’re talking about Washington, right?"" Johnson: ""The point I’m making is, a very simple phone call to these individuals, I think, would’ve ascertained immediately that there was no protest prior to this. This attack started at 9:40 p.m. Benghazi time, and it was an assault. I appreciate the fact that you called it an assault. But I’m going back to then-Ambassador (Susan) Rice five days later going on the Sunday shows and, what I would say, is purposefully misleading the American public. Why wasn’t that known? And again, I appreciate the fact that the transparency of this hearing, but why weren’t we transparent to that point in time?"" Clinton: ""Well, first of all, senator, I would say that once the assault happened, and once we got our people rescued and out, our most immediate concern was, number one, taking care of their injuries. As I said, I still have a DS (Diplomatic Security) agent at Walter Reed seriously injured — getting them into Frankfurt, Ramstein to get taken care of, the FBI going over immediately to start talking to them. We did not think it was appropriate for us to talk to them before the FBI conducted their interviews. And we did not — I think this is accurate, sir — I certainly did not know of any reports that contradicted the IC (Intelligence Community) talking points at the time that Ambassador Rice went on the TV shows. And you know I just want to say that people have accused Ambassador Rice and the administration of misleading Americans. I can say trying to be in the middle of this and understanding what was going on, nothing could be further from the truth. Was information developing? Was the situation fluid? Would we reach conclusions later that weren’t reached initially? And I appreciate the — "" Johnson: ""But, Madame Secretary, do you disagree with me that a simple phone call to those evacuees to determine what happened wouldn’t have ascertained immediately that there was no protest? That was a piece of information that could have been easily, easily obtained?"" Clinton: ""But, senator, again — "" Johnson: ""Within hours, if not days?"" Clinton: ""Senator, you know, when you’re in these positions, the last thing you want to do is interfere with any other process going on, number one — "" Johnson: ""I realize that’s a good excuse."" Clinton: ""Well, no, it’s the fact. Number two, I would recommend highly you read both what the ARB said about it and the classified ARB because, even today, there are questions being raised. Now, we have no doubt they were terrorists, they were militants, they attacked us, they killed our people. But what was going on and why they were doing what they were doing is still unknown —"" Johnson: ""No, again, we were misled that there were supposedly protests and that something sprang out of that — an assault sprang out of that — and that was easily ascertained that that was not the fact, and the American people could have known that within days and they didn’t know that."" Clinton: ""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator. Now, honestly, I will do my best to answer your questions about this, but the fact is that people were trying in real time to get to the best information. The IC has a process, I understand, going with the other committees to explain how these talking points came out. But you know, to be clear, it is, from my perspective, less important today looking backwards as to why these militants decided they did it than to find them and bring them to justice, and then maybe we’ll figure out what was going on in the meantime."" Johnson: ""Okay. Thank you, Madame Secretary."" So the transcript makes a few points fairly clear: Johnson was the guy who got Clinton riled up by asking why she didn’t call Benghazi survivors; Clinton did say ""What difference at this point does it make?"" in response to that question. But Clinton also did provide Johnson other answers. She said her priority was figuring out how to rescue those still at the compound and how to treat their injuries, not pressing them for information. She said it wasn’t appropriate for the State Department to talk to them before FBI interviews. Finally, she said her department and the administration were still trying to sort out the confusion in the days following the attacks. Our ruling Johnson said, ""I am the guy that got under her skin and provoked that infamous response from Hillary Clinton by asking a pretty simple question, 'Why didn't you just pick up the phone and call the survivors’ (of the Benghazi attack)?"" During a 2013 hearing, Johnson suggested repeatedly that had Clinton phoned the Benghazi compound, she would have known the attack wasn’t related to alleged protests. Clinton did get exasperated and say, ""What difference, at this point, does it make?"" But Johnson’s phrasing omits the fact that Clinton did provide other detailed responses to Johnson’s question. The claim is accurate but needs additional information. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809771EDC0>],/factchecks/2016/jul/20/ron-johnson/what-you-need-know-about-hillary-clintons-infamous/

Stamp this one 'correct;' Chris Christie says Clinton wrong about work-related emails
","Several speakers touched on Hillary Clinton's email scandal at the second night of the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was one. He used it to argue that ""Hillary Clinton cared more about protecting her own secrets than she cared about protecting America’s secrets. And then, she lied about it over and over and over again."" ""She said there was no marked classified information on her server. The FBI director said, that's untrue,"" Christie said. ""She said that she did not email any classified information. The FBI director, says that's untrue. She said all-work related emails were sent back to the State Department. The FBI director said, that's not true."" For this fact-check, we'll look at Christie's claim about what happened with Clinton’s work-related emails. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, decided to use a private, unsecured email server at her New York home for government business. When news of the system came to light — indirectly, as part of the investigation into the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya — Clinton's lawyers went through the 60,000 or so emails she had collected to cull out personal communication. She claimed the remaining government-related emails were turned over to the State Department. The Clinton campaign fact sheet on the controversy says she provided copies of 30,490 emails covering over 55,000 pages. ""In providing these emails to the department,"" the fact sheet says, ""Clinton included all she had that were even potentially work-related — including emails about using a fax machine or asking for iced tea during a meeting — erring on the side of over-inclusion, as confirmed by the department and National Archives’ determination that over 1,250 emails were 'personal' records (which they have indicated will be returned to her)."" That's in line with her statement on the April 3, 2016, edition of Meet the Press where she said, ""I think that anybody who's actually looked at this has concluded that I have now put out all of my emails."" (At the time, before the FBI released the results of its investigation, we gave her a Half True because more than 31,000 had been deleted by her lawyers without any government review.) And in a Sept. 4, 2015, interview on MSNBC with Andrea Mitchell, Clinton claimed that her lawyers ""went through every single email."" Then the FBI released the results of its probe. Director James Comey reported finding ""several thousand work-related emails that were not in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014."" Some were uncovered because they had been archived in government email accounts belonging to workers who had sent or received them. Some were discovered among the millions of fragments of emails stored in the unused space of the servers used by the Clinton system. Two emails were classified as ""confidential;"" one was classified as ""secret."" None were top secret. But Comey also said it wasn't surprising that those work-related emails weren't turned over. ""We found no evidence that any of the additional work-related e-mails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them,"" he said during his news conference. ""Our assessment is that, like many email users, Secretary Clinton periodically deleted emails or emails were purged from the system when devices were changed."" The FBI director also said some of the work-related emails not turned over to the State Department may have been deleted because her lawyers had not, in fact, gone through every one. Instead, they ""relied on header information and used search terms to try to find all work-related emails,"" he said. ""It is highly likely their search terms missed some work-related emails, and that we later found them, for example, in the mailboxes of other officials or in the (unused) slack space of a server."" If Clinton had been using a government account like she should have, the work-related correspondence would have been archived, the FBI director said. But her system didn't do that. When we asked the Clinton campaign about Christie's work-related email claim, spokesman Josh Schwerin noted Comey testified before Congress that three of the classified emails were not properly marked as classified, and there was no evidence that any work-related emails were intentionally deleted. Our ruling Christie told the convention that Clinton ""said all work-related emails were sent back to the State Department. The FBI director said, that's not true."" The FBI did indeed discover that work-related emails had been deleted by Clinton's lawyers despite her insistence, still posted on her website, that she included all emails ""that were even potentially work-related."" We rate Christie's statements as True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809789B6C0>],/factchecks/2016/jul/20/chris-christie/stamp-one-correct-chris-christie-says-clinton-wron/

In RNC speech, Chris Christie says Clinton called Assad a 'reformer,' a 'different kind of leader'
","The second night of the Republican National Convention turned into the court of political opinion when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took the stage. Christie reached back into his days as a federal prosecutor to do something the Justice Department said it would not do: prosecute Hillary Clinton for her performance as secretary of state. Christie pulled out criticisms of example after example — the end of the Cuban embargo, the Iran nuclear negotiations, her support for ousting fallen Libya dictator Muammar Gaddafi — before asking the crowd to shout its ""guilty"" or ""not guilty"" verdict. One of his charges included an oft-referenced comment she made about President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. ""In Syria, imagine this, imagine this. (Clinton) called President Assad a ‘reformer.’ She called Assad a ‘different kind of leader,’ "" Christie said. ""There’s now 400,000 now dead — think about that. Four hundred thousand dead at the hands of a man that Hillary defended."" PolitiFact has heard this claim before, first from Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace in June 2014, and again from U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio in October 2015. The attack has stuck to Clinton but the quote requires more context. The Arab Spring of 2011 pitted Assad, who assumed the presidency in 2000, and his government against citizens rising up for change. The starting point for what became a bloody civil war came in the remote city of Daraa, where 15 schoolchildren were arrested for spray-painting anti-government graffiti on their school with messages such as ""the people want to topple the regime,"" according to CNN. The military used brutal force to address sit-ins in Damascus and Daraa over the treatment of the jailed protesters, which spurred thousands more Syrians to turn against Assad. Clinton talked about the developments Syria on CBS’ Face the Nation on March 27, 2011. Host Bob Schieffer pressed her on why the U.S. reaction would be different from its response to Libya with air strikes. Syria, Schieffer noted, is no friend of the United States as an enemy of Israel and ally of Iran, and Assad’s father had ""killed 25,000 people, at a lick"" in 1982. Clinton’s response did include the word ""reformer"" in regards to Assad, but there was more to it than Christie and others let on. Here’s her response to Schieffer on March 27, 2011: ""Well, if there were a coalition of the international community, if there were the passage of a Security Council resolution, if there were a call by the Arab League, if there was a condemnation that was universal, but that is not going to happen because I don't think that it's yet clear what will occur, what will unfold. ""There is a different leader in Syria now. Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he's a reformer. ""What's been happening there the last few weeks is deeply concerning, but there's a difference between calling out aircraft and indiscriminately strafing and bombing your own cities than police actions which, frankly, have exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see."" Two days later, Clinton was questioned by a Wall Street Journal reporter over what critics interpreted as her defense of Assad’s regime. ""I referenced opinions of others,"" Clinton said. ""That was not speaking either for myself or for the administration."" The video shows she attributed the ""reformer"" opinion to ""members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months."" But there is a problem, as both PolitiFact and the Washington Post reported, with the ""both parties"" part. Democrats who visited with Assad around that time included California’s Nancy Pelosi, who was the House speaker in 2007, and Sen. John Kerry, then chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Kerry had an optimistic view of Assad’s leadership when he said, ""Syria will change, as it embraces a legitimate relationship with the United States and the West."" But Republicans? The Washington Post counted 13 Republicans who traveled to Syria, but they expressed skepticism, not hope, for Assad’s government. As the military crackdown on Syrians grew worse, Obama and Clinton called on Assad to go. Clinton was interviewed in November 2011 by Jake Tapper, who noted how she ""at one point seemed to have optimism that Assad was a reformer."" Clinton said, ""Well, we had hoped so because there was a lot at stake, we wanted to see an agreement, for example, between Syria and Israel. That was something that people have been working on for 30 years. We heard what Assad said about what he wanted to do for reform. But when it came to it, in the Arab Spring and as people actually demanded some freedom and their rights, he responded, as we have seen, very violently."" Christie didn’t include this chapter in his prime-time ""indictment."" A query to Christie’s spokesperson was not returned by deadline. Our ruling Christie attacked Clinton for calling Assad a ""reformer"" and a ""different kind of leader."" She did use those words, mostly, but there is more to the story. When she used the word ""reformer,"" Clinton was referencing the opinions of members of Congress who had interacted with the Syrian president and hoped he represented change for the country. And she said, ""There is a different leader in Syria now,"" and not ""a different kind of leader."" Christie is taking quotes by Clinton out of context, and ignoring historical events that followed, when Clinton denounced Assad and called for his exit.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Mitch McConnell']","
Did Hillary Clinton lie about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary?
","Republicans hope to label Hillary Clinton as a dishonest person unworthy of the White House. At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., reached back about as far as one can go in Clinton’s biography for an example. McConnell said that Clinton ""lied about her emails, she lied about her server, she lied about Benghazi, she lied about sniper fire — why she even lied about why her parents named her Hillary."" Here, we’ll look at the last one: Would Hillary Clinton lie about the origins of her name? The public discussion of the anecdote about Clinton’s naming dates back to her time as first lady. In April 1995, she was on a goodwill tour of Asia and stopped in Nepal, the country that’s home of Mount Everest, which was first climbed in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay of Nepal. ""At an airstrip in Katmandu, Nepal — just after an overnight tiger safari and just before her departure for this poverty-ridden pocket of South Asia — Mrs. Clinton shook hands with"" the famous climber, then 75, the New York Times reported. During the brief meeting, Clinton ""confessed that her mother, Dorothy Rodham, had read an article about the intrepid Edmund Hillary, a one-time beekeeper who had taken to mountain climbing, when she was pregnant with her daughter in 1947 and liked the name,"" the Times wrote. "" ‘It had two l's, which is how she thought she was supposed to spell Hillary,’ Mrs. Clinton told reporters after the brief meeting on the tarmac, minutes before her Air Force jet flew past the peak of Everest itself. ‘So when I was born, she called me Hillary, and she always told me it's because of Sir Edmund Hillary.’ "" For years, this story wasn’t widely discussed — it wasn’t mentioned in Hillary Clinton’s 2003 autobiography, Living History, for instance — but it did make its way into the autobiography of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, which was published in 2004. Within a few years, though, the story attracted some attention on the Internet when someone realized a key discrepancy -- the mountain climber achieved worldwide fame six years after Clinton was born. Eventually, in October 2006, a Clinton spokeswoman walked the story back. ""It was a sweet family story her mother shared to inspire greatness in her daughter, to great results I might add,'' said spokeswoman Jennifer Hanley, according to the New York Times. When the urban-legends checking site Snopes.com looked at the controversy, it noted that it actually wasn’t impossible that Clinton’s mother could have heard about Hillary by the time her daughter was born. It noted that he was already gaining some renown as a mountain climber prior to 1953, and even as early as the pre-World War II period. Still, when Snopes scrutinized several major American newspapers, including the Rodhams’ hometown Chicago Tribune, prior to 1953, it couldn’t find any evidence that the mountain climber had been profiled. This suggests that he was still too obscure a figure to have attracted Dorothy Rodham’s attention. It was ""almost certainly a bit of fiction invented for political expediency,"" Snopes concluded. We reached out to the Clinton campaign for this article but did not hear back. Our ruling McConnell said that Clinton ""even lied about why her parents named her Hillary."" Clinton certainly said in 1995 that she was named after Sir Edmund Hillary, but Clinton was born a few years before the mountain climber became famous. However, McConnell fails to note that a spokeswoman eventually said the story was told to her by Clinton’s mother to inspire her. McConnell’s claim is partially accurate but lacks important context. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2b295bd5-ed1d-433b-95cb-8c0ba10b42fe",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CDE140>],/factchecks/2016/jul/20/mitch-mcconnell/did-hillary-clinton-lie-about-being-named-after-si/

Florida's Sharon Day misleads on Hillary Clinton and gender pay gap
","Hillary Clinton is a hypocrite for playing the gender card, says Sharon Day, co-chair of the Republican National Committee from South Florida. ""She repeatedly plays the gender card. In fact she boasts ‘deal me in.’ Well, Mrs. Clinton, consider yourself dealt in because as a senator you paid women less than the men in your office,"" said Day at the Republican convention July 19. The gender pay gap is a frequent talking point -- sometimes botched -- by Democrats. So Day, a prominent Republican woman, is calling out the Democratic Party’s own here for the alleged sin of unequal pay. We could not reach Day Tuesday night. Gender pay gap? In 2015, we fact-checked a claim by Fox News’ Sean Hannity that as a senator, Hillary Clinton ""actually paid female staffers a lot less than men."" We rated that claim Mostly False. Hannity’s statement followed a Washington Free Beacon story that stated Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents for every dollar earned by a male counterpart. The article examined data from Senate expenditure reports from 2002-08 posted by LegiStorm Pro, a company that posts information about congressional staff including salary data. The website warns users about extrapolating exact salary information because earnings fluctuate depending on bonuses and leaves of absence. The data focused on full-time staffers who worked a complete fiscal year, Oct. 1-Sept. 30. Clinton was sworn in as New York’s junior senator in January 2001, so the Free Beacon analysis does not include her first nine months in office. The Free Beacon analysis also excludes Senate employees who took leaves of absence, which is common for employees who leave for short periods to work on campaigns, or left after even 11 months of work within the fiscal year. Regardless, the Free Beacon concluded the median salary for a woman on Clinton’s payroll was about $15,700 less than the median salary for the men of the office, or about $40,800 compared to $56,500 for men. ""The salaries speak for themselves,"" the story says. ""The data shows that women in her office were paid 72 cents for every dollar paid to men."" Clinton campaign responds Buzzfeed reached a different conclusion in 2015 in a story headlined, ""Internal Data: Hillary Clinton Paid Women And Men Equally."" The story was based on 2015 salary data for full-time staffers who worked in the Senate office, plus what they earned if they worked for a congressional committee or political groups Friends of Hillary, Hill PAC, and Hillary Clinton for President between 2002-08. The data show a median salary of $40,000 for both men and women receiving official Senate pay over those seven years (excluding Clinton’s pay, since all senators have the same salary set by law.) The median salary remains equal if you factor in non-Senate work, too. The campaign argued this is a better picture of a staffer’s annual earnings, as some staffers took time away from official duties to work for Clinton’s presidential campaign efforts in 2007 and 2008. Huma Abedin, for example, earned $20,000 in 2008 as a senior adviser on Clinton’s Senate staff, but she also made $150,000 working on the campaign that year. ""The Free Beacon based their analysis on an incomplete, and therefore, inaccurate set of numbers,"" Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin told PolitiFact in 2015. ""The fact is, Hillary Clinton paid full-time men and women equally."" If you isolate the data from year to year, the median earnings between men and women were not so even. In 2002, female Senate staffers (excluding Clinton) earned a median of $33,000, while men earned $42,500. The median pay gap closed in 2005 to $41,000 for women and $43,000 for men, and then women exceeded the men’s pay in 2006 and 2007. One caveat: there were more women working for Clinton overall than men in every year. But neither set of data fully answers whether Clinton paid men and women equally because it doesn’t compare wages for  men and women who do the same work. Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, previously told PolitiFact it’s common for Senate staffers to temporarily leave payrolls to volunteer or work for campaigns and political committees. So he favors the Clinton campaign’s approach. Making apples-to-apples comparisons is difficult, he said, ""but it is clear that the Free Beacon approach did not take into account the reality that people move in and out of payrolls on a fairly regular basis."" Our ruling Day said that as a senator Clinton ""paid women less than the men in your office."" The data used by Free Beacon showed that the median salary for a woman on Clinton’s payroll was about $15,700 less than the median salary for the men of the office. But this data has several caveats, including that it omits leaves of absences, which are common for staffers to work on campaigns. The data also didn’t contain Clinton’s first nine months in office or staffers who left after less than a year. A BuzzFeed analysis relied on more complete data and found the same median salary for men and women. But neither set of data fully answers the question about whether Clinton paid women and men the same amount for the same work.

"['Environment', 'Nevada', 'Harry Reid']","
Reid right on claiming Kochs produce more pollution than oil giants
","Charles and David Koch might be two of the people happiest about Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid’s impending retirement. The Nevada Democrat’s undisguised disdain for the billionaire brothers’ bankrolling of conservative groups is well-documented, and Reid’s long crusade against the Kochs isn’t letting up as he nears retirement. Kicking off a coordinated effort to draw attention towards conservative-leaning nonprofits and climate change skeptics, Reid zeroed in on the Kochs and accused them of being worse polluters than major oil companies. ""The company is among the worst in toxic air pollution in the entire United States,"" he said during a July 11 floor speech. ""Koch Industries churns out more climate-changing greenhouse gases than oil giants Chevron, Shell and Valero."" This isn’t the first time Reid has tried to connect the Kochs’ business operations with climate change, but we were curious to see which company has the worst environmental record. Measuring pollution Reached by email, a Reid spokesperson cited a 2014 Rolling Stone article detailing the history behind the Koch family’s ""Toxic Empire,"" particularly a line stating ""Koch's climate pollution ... outpaces oil giants including Valero, Chevron and Shell."" Rolling Stone cites a corporate polluter study published by the University of Massachusetts, Amherst’s Political Economy Research Institute. The ""Greenhouse 100 Polluters Index"" ranks Koch Industries 22nd on its list of polluters, creating more than 28 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. The survey puts them ahead of the oil companies mentioned by Reid — Chevron (32nd), Royal Dutch Shell (27th) and Valero (26th) all produced fewer emissions in 2014 than Koch Industries, according to the report. Pretty clear, right? Koch Industries spokesman Ken Spain says Reid makes an unfair comparison between Koch and companies in essentially different industries with fewer facilities. ""It is misleading to compare Koch Industries — one of the largest and diversified manufacturers in the US — to much smaller companies,"" he said in a statement. ""Koch operates more than 200 manufacturing sites that employ 60,000 people in the U.S. Therefore, it is only logical that our GHG emissions are greater than a company that has far fewer facilities."" Koch lands somewhere in the middle compared to the oil giants mentioned by Reid in terms of total revenue and employees, though they do own more facilities than the other three.  Spain does have a point that Koch is more involved in manufacturing and refining goods that actually extracting and selling fossil fuels. The corporation is ranked 13th on the ""Toxic 100 Air Polluters"" list due to the roughly 31 million pounds of toxic air releases reported by the facilities owned by the Kochs. But Koch Industries does have many more facilities than Shell, Chevron and Valero. Koch Industries’ sites actually emits millions more toxic air releases than the 12 companies ahead of them on the list, such as top polluters Dow Chemical and ExxonMobil. But the company ranks lower than those because the survey adjusts the rankings to include levels of toxicity in the pollution, not just the total amount. Still, out-ranking just 12 companies isn’t exactly an environmental badge of honor. The corporation has a long history of violating environmental rules. In 2000, the company was fined a record $30 million due to repeated violations of environmental law, including more than 300 oil spills in six states. Koch Petroleum and other major polluters also reached an accord with the EPA that same year over air pollution, agreeing to spend $80 million to reduce refinery emissions and pay a $4.5 million penalty in return for a ""clean slate"" from the EPA. Invista, a Koch-owned subsidy, agreed in 2009 to a $1.7 million penalty and promised to spend up to $500 million to fix more than 680 self-reported violations of EPA standards at 12 facilities owned by the subsidy. PolitiFact also rated Charles Koch’s comments about the corporation being a ""model for other companies"" in terms of environmental regulation Mostly False, largely due to the numerous environmental crimes committed by the company throughout the late ‘90s and early 2000s. But Koch appears to be turning the corner. Rolling Stone acknowledges that the company has improved its regulatory compliance over time, which in the words of Charles Koch required a ""monumental undertaking to integrate compliance into every aspect of the company."" In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Koch environmental director Sheryl Corrigan said the company had reduced air emissions at its refineries by 76 percent since 1997. They’ve also downsized their oil pipeline business from a high of 37,000 miles of pipeline in the late 1990s to around 4,000. Spain also pointed out a 2014 EPA Toxics Release Inventory analysis, which tracks U.S. facilities that manage and release toxic chemicals. Koch-owned businesses managed 667 million pounds of production-related waste in 2014, but the company reported implementing 240 ""Source Reduction Activities"" over the same time period — more than Shell and Chevron (though the corporation listed many more facilities than the oil giants). Our ruling Reid said, ""Koch Industries churns out more climate-changing greenhouse gases than oil giants Chevron, Shell and Valero."" Reid’s claim accurately calls on facts established in a well-respected study of corporate pollution. Koch Industries does produce more greenhouse gas emissions than the oil companies listed by Reid. But it's a somewhat misleading, apples-to-oranges comparison, because there are more Koch facilities that cover more industries compared to the oil companies. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. That meets our definition of Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a24a3586-08cf-4ee9-a52a-85c7c46929c8",[<zip object at 0x00000280971CC880>],/factchecks/2016/jul/19/harry-reid/reid-right-claiming-kochs-produce-more-pollution-o/

Trump’s wife, Melania, was the headline speaker Monday night in Cleveland, but it appears she borrowed some words from a 2008 speech by Michelle Obama. Read our comparison of the two speeches here. ""There’s a political tint to this whole issue,"" Manafort said in a televised statement July 19. ""The Clinton camp was the first to get it out there and try to say there was something untoward about the speech that Melania Trump gave. It’s just another example, as far as we’re concerned, that when Hillary Clinton is threatened by a female, the first thing she does is try to destroy the person."" Given the extensive media coverage of this story, we were curious about Manafort’s claim that the Clinton campaign planted it. As it turns out, the Clinton campaign was not the first to note similarities between the Trump and Obama speeches. It was Jarrett Hill, a Los Angeles-based Twitter user who describes himself as an interior designer and a journalist. ""Melania must’ve liked Michelle Obama’s 2008 Convention speech, since she plagiarized it,"" Hill tweeted at 10:40 p.m. Monday night.  Hill told PolitiFact that he was watching Trump’s speech, and a couple of the lines made him think, ""Whoa, that’s weird. I heard that before."" He then tweeted at some NBC journalists to draw their attention to the similarities to Obama’s speech, and the story blew up. Hill said he has ""literally no ties to the Clinton campaign,"" though he is a registered Democrat. He has not heard from anyone involved with the Clinton campaign before or since he uncovered the potential plagiarism. Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri denied that it is the story’s source in a tweet.   In fact, the Clinton campaign has not issued any statement or public response to the story, other than the tweet from Palmieri's personal account. One arm, Correct the Record, retweeted one of Hill’s tweets. A few individual campaign staffers have tweeted about it, too. But this was all after Hill made the original connection. CNN’s Chris Cuomo asked Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz if the Democratic Party or Clinton campaign planted the attack on Melania Trump. Wasserman Schultz did not reply with a flat ""no,"" but she said, ""the Trump Organization, whether it's Paul Manafort or anyone, all the way up to Donald Trump himself, anytime they are caught red-handed engaging in distortions, inaccuracies, a fact pattern that is clearly not accurate, they blame someone else. And so they should be prepared to be held accountable for the content of anything delivered from the stage of the Republican National Convention."" We tried to reach Donald Trump’s campaign multiple times but did not hear back. Our ruling Manafort said, ""The Clinton camp was the first to get it out there and try to say there was something untoward about the speech that Melania Trump gave."" The Clinton campaign has barely reacted to the claims that Melania Trump took some phrases from a 2008 Michelle Obama speech.

But they also made partisan jabs, including this one by Duffy: ""Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have left us with $19 trillion in debt."" We asked three federal budget experts, including Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, about Duffy’s claim. ""It’s sort of garden-variety political exaggeration,"" Bixby said. Here’s why. Debt figures The U.S. Treasury Department’s ""Debt to the Penny"" calculator shows the total federal debt is nearly $19.4 trillion. That includes nearly $14 trillion in debt held by the public -- by individuals, corporations, Federal Reserve banks, foreign governments, and other entities -- and $5.4 trillion in what are known as intragovernmental holdings. So, Duffy is correct on the overall figure. But many factors bear on how it got there. And, the experts said, it’s really not possible to calculate how much any one of them is responsible for the debt. Bixby; Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget; and Rudolph Penner, a fellow at the Urban Institute and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, told us: 1. About half of the $19 trillion was amassed before Obama took office in January 2009. 2. Obama took office amid a deep recession, which meant government revenues fell and spending on government programs rose. ""The debt would have exploded certainly during (Obama’s) first term, no matter who was president,"" said Bixby. 3. Obama proposed federal budgets, but Congress, including the Republican leadership, ultimately holds the purse strings. Obama bears some of the responsibility for not taking steps to prevent the debt from growing, ""but attributing the debt to a president doesn’t make sense,"" said MacGuineas. Meanwhile, Clinton, as Obama’s secretary of state, made budget requests for her department. But that’s a tiny amount of the overall federal budget and the secretary of state has virtually nothing to do with overall fiscal policy. Our rating Duffy said: ""Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have left us with $19 trillion in debt."" The total federal debt is at $19 trillion. But most of it was amassed before Obama took office. And many factors -- Congress, the economy and Obama himself, but to almost no extent Clinton -- played a role in the debt increases during Obama’s tenure. For a claim that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/212be74c-0104-4349-a8ef-bade8c9f88f1",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D4F380>],/factchecks/2016/jul/19/sean-duffy/gop-rep-sean-duffy-exaggerates-role-barack-obama-h/

Tim Kaine erroneously says Donald Trump is 'against minimum wage'
","U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine says Donald Trump is no friend to working Americans. ""He’s a 'you're fired' guy,"" Kaine said July 14 while introducing Hillary Clinton during a rally for her Democratic presidential campaign at Northern Virginia Community College in Annandale. Kaine, widely reported to be among three finalists Clinton is considering for vice president, ticked off a series of issues on which he said Trump has betrayed workers. Among his beefs, Kaine accused Trump of ""being against minimum wage."" ""We want a ‘you’re hired’ president. It starts with fairness, equal pay for women, raising the minimum wage,"" Kaine said, drawing cheers from the crowd. Is Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, ""against minimum wage,"" as Kaine says? The answer is complicated.    The federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. But it should be noted that 45 states set their own minimum wage, and 29 of them set it at a higher rate than the federal level, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Fourteen states, including Virginia, have a rate that’s the same as the federal rate, while another seven states either have no minimum or set it at a rate lower than the federal level. In instances where the federal rate is higher than a state minimum or in states where there is no bottom rate, the federal wage prevails. In states where the minimum wage is set above the federal rate, the higher state rate applies. Trump’s stance on wages has been murky. During a  November 2015 primary debate, said that wages are ""too high"" and hamper the U.S. in competing with other nations. When asked if he would back an increase in the minimum wage, he said, ""I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is."" At others times during the months after that debate, Trump said he didn’t understand how people could live on $7.25 an hour. Our colleagues at PolitFact North Carolina recently looked at a Clinton claim that Trump wants to get rid of a federal minimum wage. Her  statement was rated True because of comments Trump made in a May 8 appearance on NBC’s ""Meet The Press,"" when host Chuck Todd attempted to pin him down on his minimum wage stance. PolitiFact North Carolina noted that Trump began by expressing sympathy for minimum wage workers. ""I have seen what’s going on, and I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour,"" he said. Trump said although he would like to see a higher minimum wage, he wouldn’t do anything, if elected, to make that a reality. ""I would like to see an increase of some magnitude,"" Trump told Todd. ""But I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don't forget, the states have to compete with each other."" Todd asked whether the federal government at least should set a floor on wages and allow the states to go higher. ""No,"" Trump replied. ""I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do."" We reached out to Clinton’s Virginia campaign to find out the source of Kaine’s claim that Trump opposes the minimum wage. We were pointed to a series of Trump statements that all said he thought the minimum wage should be set by states, not Congress. ""On the minimum wage, I would like to leave it to the states because frankly, every state is different. Every state has different costs of living and everything else, and I would like to leave it to the states,"" Trump said in a May 9 interview on the Fox Business Network. ""But I will tell you, $7.25 is pretty tough, and as far as I’m concerned I could see something happening there, but I would leave it to the states."" Trump made a similar statement to Fox host Sean Hannity on May 12. ""I really like the idea because it’s so different - you know, it’s a big country - it’s so different and the cost of living is so different, I like letting the states set the minimum wage,"" Trump said. In a radio interview on KVI in Seattle, Trump said again that states should set their own minimum wage, although he suggested that states that boosted their bottom wage might become uncompetitive with other states. ""I actually think that the states should make the decision,"" Trump said. ""Here's what's going to happen. … All of a sudden in some cases states are going to become non-competitive and they're going to start losing maybe jobs and losing business, and they're going to have to readjust. Otherwise, they're just not going to have anything."" In the past, Trump has bristled at suggestions he opposes a federal minimum wage. In May, PolitiFact examined Trump’s claim that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., ""lied"" when she said he wanted to abolish the federal minimum wage. That was rated Mostly False. PolitiFact reached out to Trump to see if he merely had misspoken when he told Todd he doesn’t support a federal wage floor but did not hear back. We emailed the Trump campaign twice for comment on his position on the minimum wage but also did not hear back. Our ruling  Kaine said Trump is ""against minimum wage."" We would have had no issue if Kaine had said Trump opposes a federal minimum wage. But the senator’s statement lacks that specificity. Trump repeatedly has said that Washington should not dictate a national minimum wage and that the matter should be left entirely to the states. So we rate Kaine’s unqualified statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c1236a3a-7db8-4ef1-9efd-60fa907ce4db

"['California', 'Guns', 'Safety For All Initiative']","
It's no Whopper: Licensed gun dealers outnumber McDonald’s about 2-to-1 in California
","Gun control advocates make a lot of claims about how easy it is to get a firearm in America. ""We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book,"" President Barack Obama said last week at a memorial service for five officers slain by a sniper in Dallas, Texas. PolitiFact rated the president’s claim Mostly False, noting it was a flawed comparison that relied on anecdotal rather than hard evidence. In California, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is among the state’s biggest gun control backers. He led the campaign to place Proposition 63, known as the Safety For All Initiative, on the state’s November ballot. It would require instant background checks for ammunition purchases; strengthen checks for gun purchases and ban the possession of large, detachable military-style magazines; and require the immediate surrender of firearms for people convicted of serious and violent crimes. The Safety For All campaign made a recent statement about the prevalence of gun dealers in California. It’s a colorful claim like Obama’s, but has a bit more hard data to back it up. ""There are at least twice as many licensed firearm dealers in California as there are McDonald’s,"" the campaign’s spokesman said in recent email. PolitiFact Georgia rated a similar claim in 2013 as Mostly True. A civil rights activist said: ""There are twice as many gun shops as McDonald’s in the United States."" Our California claim deals with licenses in this state only, and not necessarily brick-and-mortar gun shops. With our appetite piqued, we decided to dig into this fast-food-meets-firearms platter. Golden Arches Not surprisingly, there are many places in California to get a Big Mac -- more than a thousand, according to several sources. The American Enterprise Institute and the Foundation for Economic Education reported in April that, at that time, there were 1,165 McDonald’s in California. A Cal State Northridge study cited the same figure. A McDonald’s spokeswoman could not immediately confirm that figure. The company’s website, however, puts its nationwide restaurant total at more than 14,000. Assuming 1,165 is correct for California, there would need to be at least 2,330 licensed gun dealers in the state to make the campaign’s statement correct.  Photo by Mike Mozart / Flickr Gun dealers To be licensed in California, gun dealers must obtain both state and federal permits; be 21 or older; pay a $200 application fee; have a valid address; and undergo criminal and credit background checks. They don’t necessarily need a commercial storefront. Pinpointing the number of licensed gun dealers in the state is not simple. The Safety For All campaign referred us to data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The ATF keeps a monthly log on its website of how many dealers and pawnbrokers are licensed to sell guns in each state. This month’s tally shows 2,315 dealers and pawnbrokers licensed to sell guns in California. That’s a shade less, 15 in fact, than twice as many McDonald’s. But the Safety For All campaign spokesman asserted there are hundreds more people authorized to sell guns in California, under different federal license categories.  Other categories Those extra federal categories include 521 licensed firearms manufacturers and 74 licensed firearms importers in California. Roger Root, who oversees firearm license investigations for the ATF in Northern California, said those nearly 600 licensed manufacturers and importers are, in fact, federally authorized to deal guns, even if they’re not technically called ‘dealers.’ ""We don’t require that they get an additional (federal) license,"" Root said. ""You are also allowed, in essence, to deal firearms."" That would bump the number of people licensed to sell guns in California closer to 2,900, more than twice as many McDonald’s. There's one wrinkle. About 5 percent or less of federal license holders, in all firearms categories, never go on to obtain an equivalent state firearms license required by the California Department of Justice, Root said. But taking 5 percent away from the 2,900, would still leave far more than twice as many McDonald’s. Our rating Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Safety For All Initiative campaign recently claimed: ""There are at least twice as many licensed firearm dealers in California as there are McDonald’s."" Firearms license data tracked by the ATF show there are currently 2,315 authorized firearms dealers and pawnbrokers in the state. Two other categories authorized to deal firearms bring the total closer to 2,900, which is far more than double the 1,165 Golden Arches in California. A small fraction of the federal licensees never obtain their equivalent California permit. So, the total could be somewhat less than 2,900, but still enough to validate the statement.

Obama is not 'absolutely' a Muslim, as RNC speaker claims
","President Barack Obama is a Christian, but that doesn’t stop people from saying he’s a Muslim. Antonio Sabato Jr., an actor who spoke the first night of the Republican National Convention, told ABC News after his speech that Obama is ""absolutely"" a Muslim. ""I don't believe the guy is a Christian,"" Sabato said. ""He has never talked about Jesus Christ once."" ""We had a Muslim president for seven and half years,"" Sabato added. PolitiFact has done extensive fact-checking on Obama's faith and has debunked false claims in chain e-mails that he attended a radical Islamic school, that his political rise mirrored a biblical tale about the Antichrist, and that he took the oath for U.S. Senate on a Koran. All three earned our lowest rating, Pants on Fire. This claim will, too. Our fact-checking shows clear evidence that Obama is a Christian. According to Obama’s memoirs and independent biographies, Obama was not raised in any particular faith. He became a Christian when he was in his 20s while working as a community organizer in Chicago. Obama said the churches there impressed him with their commitment to social justice and the hope they gave to the poor. ""It was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity United Church of Christ on 95th Street in the Southside of Chicago one day and affirm my Christian faith,"" Obama said in a 2006 speech. ""It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany. I didn't fall out in church. The questions I had didn't magically disappear. But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God's spirit beckoning me. I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth."" The pastor of Trinity then was Jeremiah Wright, the minister from whom Obama distanced himself in the 2008 presidential campaign, after video of some of Wright's more controversial sermons were aired on television and the Internet. The break between the two men was over Wright's comments about American foreign policy and race relations, not tenets of Christian doctrine. Several independent reports have documented Obama's church membership and faith life. ""Along his Senate campaign trail (in 2004), Obama would never fail to carry his Christian Bible. He would place it right beside him, in the small compartment in the passenger side door of the SUV, so he could refer to it often,"" reported journalist David Mendell in his 2007 biography Obama: From Promise to Power. After the falling out with Wright, Obama said he intended to find a new church once the campaign was over. In office, though, Obama has not attended one church regularly. Instead, he has worshipped at various churches in the Washington area, including the Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, and St. John's Episcopal Church. He also has attended services at Camp David, the presidential retreat. So why do so many people keep saying he's Muslim? A benign explanation is that there is genuine confusion about his religion because Obama has Muslim ancestors on his father's side and a traditionally Muslim middle name, Hussein. Another is that people who disagree with him politically and dislike the Muslim religion want to associate him with something they perceive to be negative. None of it, however, makes the claim correct. Our ruling Sabato said Obama is ""absolutely"" a Muslim. That’s wrong.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Jeff Sessions']","
Sen. Jeff Sessions wrongly says 350,000 people succeed in crossing the border every year
","U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., spoke about jobs, wages and immigrant workers on the first night of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Sessions said that when more workers come into the United States than there are jobs available, job prospects and wages fall. And when it comes to illegal immigration, ""there are about 350,000 people who succeed in crossing our borders illegally each year,"" Sessions said in his speech. We wondered if that number was right. We reached out to Sessions’ office for data supporting his statement but did not hear back. We found a Dec. 22, 2015, border security report by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security detailing apprehensions by fiscal year. The federal government’s fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30. In fiscal year 2015, Border Patrol tallied 337,117 apprehensions nationwide, a decrease from 486,651 in fiscal year 2014 — and almost 80 percent below apprehension peaks in 2000, according to the federal report. ""Illegal migration, as defined by total Border Patrol apprehensions, continues to reflect an overall decline compared to the peak in 2000,"" the report said. Other sources point to apprehension levels hovering around Sessions’ 350,000 estimates, though they also find such numbers to be in decline. A report issued in 2013 by the National Foundation for American Policy, a think tank focused on trade and immigration, analyzed U.S. Border Patrol data and found that in fiscal year 1999, Border Patrol had more than 1.5 million apprehensions along the Southwest border. That number dropped by fiscal year 2009, when border patrol counted 540,865 apprehensions, according to the think tank. It was even lower by fiscal year 2012, with 356,873 apprehensions, NFAP found. But Sessions said that 350,000 ""succeed in crossing our border."" The apprehension numbers represent people who did not succeed.   At any rate, the falling apprehension statistics were part of NFAP study, which found that ""the rise in immigrant deaths comes at a time when fewer people are attempting to enter illegally, as measured by the significant drop in apprehensions at the border over the past several years."" Border apprehension data is what is frequently used as a measure of illegal entry, though it represents events, not individuals, the Department of Homeland Security notes. As a result, apprehension numbers during a specific period will be more than total number of unique individuals, because some immigrants may be apprehended more than once, the department points out. An analysis by Pew Research Center published in 2015 also shows that in recent years, more Mexican immigrants have gone back to Mexico from the United States than have actually come into the country. That means the number of immigrants illegally in the country is staying the same or getting smaller. Stephen R. Kelly, a visiting professor at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, considers Sessions' statistic too high, even though no one knows exactly how many people illegally enter the United States every year, he said. ""Sen. Sessions' statistic is undoubtedly too high, and ignores the larger trend of sharply dropping illegal immigration to the U.S.,"" Kelly said via email. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, also says Session’s figure is probably too high, pointing to border patrol data that says apprehension figures are declining. ""If the stock of illegals is constant and the percentage of them who are coming legally and overstaying is increasing, then the number coming across the border must have fallen,"" Nowrasteh said in an email. Our ruling Sessions said, ""There are about 350,000 people who succeed in crossing our borders illegally each year."" The most common way federal officials track illegal entry is border apprehensions. In fiscal year 2015, the border patrol had 337,117 apprehensions nationwide, a decline from previous fiscal year and a significant drop from peaks in 2000. But those numbers represent people who are unsuccessful in crossing the border. Sessions said the opposite. Also apprehension numbers do not necessarily represent number of people crossing borders, since they track events, not individuals, according to Department of Homeland Security. The number of immigrants illegally in the country is staying the same or getting smaller.

"['National', 'Elections', 'Donald Trump']","
Trump says, without proof, that he recommended Ohio for GOP convention
","On the opening night of the Republican convention, Donald Trump told Fox News host Bill O’Reilly he was grateful it was held in Cleveland. ""I wanted it to be here, and we had lots of choices,"" Trump said. ""I wanted it to be in Ohio. I recommended Ohio. And people fought very hard that it be in Ohio. It's a tremendous economic development event, and you look at the way it's going so far, it's very impressive. I wanted it be here, the Republicans wanted it to be here."" We wondered, did Trump get involved in picking Cleveland? If he did, we couldn’t find a trace of it. We asked the Trump campaign for details, and we’re still waiting to hear back. Trump’s statement seems odd because of the timing. The Republican National Committee named a site selection committee in January 2014. Cities submitted proposals to show that they had a big enough venue, enough hotel rooms, the organizational heft to pull all the pieces together, and activities for the delegates. By April, the committee had winnowed its choices down to Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, and Las Vegas. On July 8, 2014, the Republican National Committee announced it had picked Cleveland. At the time, Trump not only wasn’t a candidate, he didn’t seem to be a likely candidate. An Associated Press rundown of the potential contenders didn’t include Trump, but it did have Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal, Rand Paul, Rick Perry, Marco Rubio, Paul Ryan, Rick Santorum and Scott Walker. With the exception of Paul Ryan, everyone on the list ultimately threw his hat into the ring. We looked to see if Trump had any reaction after Cleveland was picked, but there was no sign of him in the convention coverage. Instead, all we found were articles about the closure of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. Trump said more closures might be on the way. We spoke to Steve Duprey, a member of the site selection committee, and he told us he doesn’t recall Trump’s name coming up in any meeting. ""It’s possible he said something to somebody, but I never heard of it,"" Duprey said. We did not hear back from the committee chair. A search of the Nexis database of newspapers, transcripts and wire reports going back long before Cleveland was announced produced no statement from Trump. His name and the Republican convention didn’t appear together in the first half of 2014. Our ruling Trump said he liked having the convention in Cleveland and that he had recommended Ohio. It’s possible that he put in a good word for either Cleveland or Cincinnati (both are in Ohio), but there’s no record of him saying anything about either one. He was not a candidate when Cleveland was picked in 2014, and he made no public statement at the time. The Trump campaign hasn’t published any evidence of an early recommendation, nor could we find any in a Nexis search. Plus, a member of the site selection committee has no recollection of Trump having voiced a preference. The selection of Cleveland was conducted by the party in 2014, when it wasn’t known who would ultimately win the nomination.

'Stand-down' story ignores critical facts about effort to save Americans in Benghazi
","When the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, came under attack on Sept. 11, 2012, the only United States force able to respond quickly was a CIA security team made of up of private contractors stationed in a nearby annex. While promoting their bestselling book on the attack, at least three members of the six-person team have asserted that they defied ""stand-down"" orders to rush to stop the attack, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens. During the first night of the Republican convention in Cleveland, one of them, Mark ""Oz"" Geist said that because of their actions, ""there were more than 30 American lives that were saved that night. And it’s because Americans never give up. We refuse to lose. Benghazi has been a four-letter word for the left but is not about politics. Benghazi was about opportunities. Opportunities taken when we defied the stand-down orders."" We talked about the stand-down issue when we gave Fox News' Sean Hannity a Mostly False for his assertion that ""during the (Benghazi) attack, a stand-down order was given, and our troops were told to change their clothes four times."" Our ruling was based on the Republican-written report on the crisis, released June 28 by the House Select Committee on Benghazi. We'll use that report as the basis for this fact-check as well. Technically, when a military force is told to ""stand-down,"" it means the force is no longer on alert or operational. It's clear from the report, though, that the security team never stood down. Whether the team was ever told to stand down is a matter of debate. It was told to wait, for reasons the report makes clear. The attack on the Benghazi compound began at 9:42 p.m. At the time, according to the report, the United States was working with several militia groups that were active and cooperative after the regime of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled a year earlier. One militia group was the Feb. 17 Martyrs Brigade, which had pledged to help with compound security. When the attack began, a frantic call for help was made to the CIA annex about a mile away. The annex security team, known as the GRS, started getting their gear together as annex officials made fruitless calls trying to contact the local groups — including the Feb. 17 militia. Their goal: find out who was involved in the fight and whether they could get additional equipment for the security team. The GOP report goes into this issue in some detail. The unnamed man in charge of the CIA annex, the chief of base, told the committee that the leader of the security team asked for a gun truck from the Feb. 17 militia. The chief made the call and was told one wasn't available but they would try to work on it. The report says the base chief ""was adamant that he never told the Annex team members to 'stand down,'"" quoting him as saying he was working with the team leader ""the whole time in an effort to get them, go get them gone, to have them go."" ""I never had any doubt about the GRS people going to the State Department compound."" he base chief told the committee. ""I had great concerns and great worry about it, but I did not, I did not tell anybody to stand down."" But he did tell them to wait so he could try to get the gun truck for them, ""but it wasn't 10 minutes, or five minutes,"" he also said, ""There was nobody, myself or anybody else in Benghazi, that did anything to hold up the GRS deploying. The team lead was always cleared to go. ... I think I carried an ammo can at one time to get those guys out the door."" The deputy chief of base, according to the report, told the committee that the team leader told him and the base chief, ""We got to go get those guys. And the Chief of Base responded, 'Absolutely.' 'Absolutely.' Not, 'I got to go call the chief of station.' Not, 'I got to go check with somebody in Washington. All he said was, 'Absolutely.' ""So I want to make that very clear because I know there’s conflicting accounts about that discussion,"" he said. ""There were three people in that discussion: myself, the GRS team leader, and the chief of base. And anybody writing any books or making movies, or whatever else, I can tell you none of those guys (who claim there was stand-down order) were in the room when that discussion occurred."" The decision to allow the six to go was made even though it would have left the CIA annex essentially defenseless, according to the officials. They were also trying to contact the militia so the squad wouldn't get into a firefight with friendly militia forces. ""I feel like the narrative that I have seen in public does not account for this and does not account for the consideration that there was a green-on-blue situation that could have wiped all of those guys out. And then where would we have been?"" the deputy CIA chief of base said. ""We wouldn’t have had the ability to do anything to help the State Department people, and we wouldn’t have had the ability to evacuate ourselves or defend ourselves if we came under attack."" Video from the annex showed that 23 minutes elapsed between the time of the frantic call from the mission to the time the annex team was rolling. The report says another member of the security also could not recall the chief ever saying the stand down, ""but he did recall the chief of base telling them to wait."" ""I respected the fact that he wanted us to wait and see if he can gather additional fire power to help,"" he told the committee. ""At some point, though, the wait was too long, and we decided, you know, we couldn’t wait any longer and we left."" Other team members also recalled being required to wait while the base chief, his deputy and the team leader worked the phones to get information or assistance. But one did put it this way. ""And I just say: Hey, you know, we've got to get over there. We're losing the initiative. The chief of base looks at me, he says: Stand down, you need to wait. You need to come up with a plan."" According to the report, that security team member was asked why he had not disclosed the ""stand-down"" order during previous testimony to Congress. He didn't give a direct answer. ""I just know when we got told to stand down and when (the team lead) kind of gave the brief of kind of like why we're told to stand down, it was kind of understandable, you know."" Kris Paronto, a former Army ranger hired for the team, told Hannity in a June 28 interview, ""Twice the word 'wait' was used. Once the words 'stand down' was used. But to me that's semantics."" We don't think so. Being told to stand down means you're not going. According to all the evidence in the GOP report it's clear that — short of some sudden intervention by Benghazi militia friendly to the United States coming in to save the day — they were. Our ruling Geist said, ""We defied the stand-down orders"" during the Benghazi attack. All the evidence suggests that if the phrase ""stand down"" was used by officials — and there's debate about that — it was said only once in an effort to buy time to get intelligence information and equipment to a security team that was justifiably chomping at the bit to respond. Testimony in the House Select Committee on Benghazi report shows there was no stand-down order to defy because there was never an order to not intervene in the unfolding disaster. The ""stand-down"" story contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/34e74e97-56fe-47b1-9036-1078e78cbb74",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2C7A80>],/factchecks/2016/jul/19/mark-geist/stand-down-story-ignores-critical-facts-about-effo/

Rudy Giuliani wrongly says Hillary Clinton is for open borders
","Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended Donald Trump’s plan to secure the border and said that Hillary Clinton would take the opposite approach. ""You know Donald Trump will secure our borders,"" Giuliani said at the Republican convention July 18. ""His opponent has had her chance to do this, and she has failed. Hillary Clinton is for open borders."" Claiming that Clinton would create ""open borders"" suggests she would allow undocumented immigrants to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries. That’s not what Clinton has proposed. Clinton supported legislation in 2013 that included a path to citizenship (with conditions) and heightened border security. However, some experts argue that ""open borders"" doesn't necessarily mean no enforcement at all, but rather making it far easier for undocumented immigrants to stay here. Clinton does want to make it easier for many undocumented immigrants, but that’s not the same as getting rid of enforcement or allowing people to enter and leave the United States without border control. We were unable to locate a Giuliani spokesperson Monday night. Clinton’s proposal Clinton and Trump have taken vastly different approaches on immigration, although they have both said they favor secure borders. During this campaign, Clinton has called for addressing immigration laws including a path to citizenship within her first 100 days. But she has also called for protecting borders and deporting criminals or those who pose threats. ""We need to secure our borders. I’m for it, I voted for it, I believe in it, and we also need to deal with the families, the workers who are here, who have made contributions, and their children,"" she said in November. ""We can do more to secure our border, and we should do more to deal with the 11 or 12 million people who are here, get them out of the shadows."" This is pretty consistent with her view as a New York senator and secretary of state. In her 2014 book Hard Choices, Clinton praised the 2013 immigration bill co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of senators including Marco Rubio of Florida. That bill included billions for border enforcement over a decade for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. That bill passed the Senate but never reached a vote in the House. Clinton’s immigration platform does not amount to open borders, Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, previously told PolitiFact Florida when we fact-checked a similar claim by Trump that we rated False. Open borders existed before 1875, when there were no federal restrictions on emigrating to the country, he said. The United States had immigration restrictions from 1875 to 1924 without a border patrol, which was created in 1924. It’s wrong to conflate ""open borders"" with anything less than perfect enforcement of immigration laws, he said. It’s also wrong to ""claim Clinton is for open borders while she has also supported massive increases in border security to better enforce our restrictive immigration laws."" But Clinton has said she wants to limit deportations to violent criminals, not deport children and end raids and round-ups and go further than President Barack Obama for DREAMers and their parents if legally possible — although that is in legal limbo after the U.S. Supreme Court deadlocked. That greatly expands who could avoid deportation in a Clinton White House. Those policies amount to less enforcement to supporters of reduced immigration, including Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, and Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA. Beck has told PolitiFact that the term ""open borders"" is imprecise. However, if undocumented immigrants can ""stay as long as you don’t commit a violent crime, that is pretty close to open borders. You don’t have to give amnesty -- you can just not have a threat of deportation, and it allows people to stay."" Our ruling Giuliani said, ""Hillary Clinton is for open borders."" Clinton supported a 2013 bill that would have invested billions in border security in addition to a path to citizenship. As a presidential candidate she has called for securing the border and targeting deportation to criminals and those who pose security threats. While her plan would make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to avoid deportation, that’s not the same as allowing a free-for-all at the border and ending enforcement. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cbe27e82-8435-4872-8e49-12f87464cb98",[<zip object at 0x00000280967E3180>],/factchecks/2016/jul/19/rudy-giuliani/rudy-giuliani-wrongly-says-hillary-clinton-open-bo/
"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Trade', 'Jeff Sessions']","
Mostly False: Jeff Sessions says Clinton is 'champion' of global trade deals, including TPP
","Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, one of the earliest congressmen to back Donald Trump, echoed Trump’s critique of Hillary Clinton’s trade agenda at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. ""She has been a champion of globalist trade agreements,"" Sessions said during the convention’s opening night. ""But the facts are in. They have not worked for the American people.  When those agreements were signed, Presidents (Bill) Clinton and Obama promised our dangerous trade deficits with China and Korea would be reduced. But, the deficit with China has increased fivefold and the deficit with Korea doubled. These are job-killing numbers. They are now pushing the disastrous 5,000-page ‘Obamatrade’ — the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement."" This sounds like a variation of Trump’s claim (parroted from Clinton’s Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders): ""Hillary Clinton voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions, millions of jobs. "" Both Sanders and Trump received Half True ratings for their claims, but Sessions’ claim is less accurate. He’s painting Clinton’s position on free trade with an overly broad brush and is just plain wrong on her supporting for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP.   In reality, Clinton has zigzagged through the years when it comes to free trade. From 1993 to 2016, she supported eight deals, opposed two, flip-flopped from opposing to supporting three, and flip-flopped the other way on two others. Clinton as first lady spoke favorably in the 1990s and 2000s of the North American Free Trade Agreement. (Sessions is right NAFTA was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, but he neglected to mention that the deal was envisioned by Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and negotiated by George H. W. Bush). As a senator from New York, Clinton had the opportunity to vote on 10 trade deals. She said yes to six and no to the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) and a deal with Andean countries. She skipped the votes on agreements with Jordan and Peru, which came up when she was running for president the first time, but supported both deals. As a presidential candidate in 2008, Clinton had different opinions on various trade deals, and she changed her position on NAFTA. She called NAFTA ""a mistake"" and opposed pending deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. She reiterated her support for free trade with Peru on the campaign trail. As secretary of state, Clinton walked back her opposition to deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, and helped negotiate them as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But as a presidential candidate in 2016, Clinton has reiterated her opposition to CAFTA and flip-flopped on her support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Here’s a breakdown: Our ruling Sessions said Clinton ""has been a champion of globalist trade agreements. ... Worst of all, they are now pushing the disastrous 5,554-page Obamatrade — the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement."" Clinton has largely supported free trade deals, but calling her a ""champion"" of them goes too far. Out of the 15 trade deals that she’s commented or voted on from 1993 to 2016, she currently opposes four of them, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal that Sessions singled out. We rate Sessions’ claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/66f39bcc-aed2-45b1-9d58-641cdff013eb",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A5FFC0>],/factchecks/2016/jul/19/jeff-sessions/mostly-false-jeff-sessions-says-clinton-champion-g/
