Vermont's leaves are changing, but is the racial makeup of its population?
","A Saturday Night Live skit on September 29 spoofed Vermont’s reputation as a ""Caucasian paradise"" with a fake meeting held by white supremacists. In response, Agency of Commerce and Community Development Secretary Michael Schirling sent SNL some Vermont flannel shirts Oct. 2 and responded to the show’s creators that Vermont is becoming more racially diverse. ""We invite SNL viewers to Vermont to see all that we have to offer, including our increasingly diverse communities and wide array of tourist destinations including the African American Heritage Trail,"" said Schirling in the statement, which the department sent to Boston.com. ""Now is a perfect time to visit or to consider a move here. The leaves are changing and so is Vermont,"" he said. We decided to see if Schirling's statement was true, given that Vermont remains the second whitest state in the union. Is the state becoming more racially diverse? It turns out there has been a slight uptick in Vermont's non-white population. Schirling said he obtained his information from the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, a research project that produces population, demographic and housing estimates, indeed has found that Vermont is becoming more racially diverse, or at least less white. The survey found that Vermont was 95 percent white in 2013 and 94.2 percent white in 2017, a drop of 0.8 percent, according to a spokesperson for the American Community Survey. Within the category of non-white races in the Census data, there are many variations. From 2013 to 2017, the increase in the African-American population from 1.1 percent to 1.3 percent, was not statistically significant. But the percent change in the Asian and Hispanic populations was: Asians went from 1.2 percent of the Vermont population to 1.8 percent, a 0.6 percentage point increase; Hispanics went from 1.5 percent to 1.9 percent, a 0.4 percentage point increase. Our ruling The statement that Vermont is becoming increasingly diverse needs further clarification. Schirling does not explain that the increase in Vermont's racially diverse populations is slight.   We rate the statement Half True.

Karin Housley twists Tina Smith’s finances to allege profits from big pharma
","In a recent Minnesota Republican ad for U.S. Senate, a man and woman clink flutes of champagne on the beach as text rolls across the screen: ""Tina Smith loves the good life."" Smith is defending her U.S. Senate seat on Nov. 6. She was appointed to the position earlier this year after fellow Democrat Al Franken stepped down following sexual misconduct allegations. The ""good life"" ad comes from Smith’s Republican challenger, state Sen. Karin Housley, and the text on screen quickly departs from the beach scene’s serenity.   The next line: ""Tina profited from the opioid crisis."" The ad lists other dubious ways Smith supposedly enjoys herself, but this one caught our attention. We decided to see if the claim that Smith benefited financially from the opioid crisis held any water. As evidence of Smith profiting from the opioid crisis, Housley’s campaign sent us financial disclosure forms, pointing to Smith and her husband’s jointly owned stock in Abbott Laboratories of a value between $250,000 and $500,000. The Smiths invested in St. Jude Medical, a medical device company, which was acquired by Abbott Laboratories in 2017. After the acquisition, St. Jude Medical stock was changed to Abbott stock. In 1996, Abbott partnered in aggressive OxyContin marketing with Purdue Pharma — the company responsible for introducing OxyContin as a supposedly safe opioid pill. In OxyContin’s first year on the market, Abbott made $49 million. That annual figure had jumped to $1.6 billion by 2002.   But Abbott cut off its opioid connections in 2002, nearly 15 years before it acquired the company in which the Smiths held stock.

The Housley campaign also pointed out that Archie Smith, Tina’s husband, held between $1,000 and $15,000 in stock in Johnson & Johnson, which has been sued for its role in the opioid crisis. Johnson & Johnson is a also a parent company of two companies that have also been sued for marketing opioids. In Smith’s most recent financial report, the income from that stock was between $200 and $1,000. Housley claimed Smith profited from the opioid crisis. The idea that the Smiths benefited financially from Abbott Laboratories’ actions a full 14 years before the company acquired St. Jude Medical goes too far. Smith’s husband does hold between $1,000 and $15,000 in stock in Johnson & Johnson, but it's hard to draw a straight line from that amount of stock ownership to ""profiting off the opioid crisis.""  Overall, the statement is not accurate.

"['Impeachment', 'North Carolina', 'Mark Harris']","
Dan McCready hasn't said he'd impeach Trump
","Elections across the United States have become a referendum on President Donald Trump, and the same is true in North Carolina. In North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, Mark Harris beat out incumbent Republican Robert Pittenger while arguing Pittenger wasn’t loyal enough to Trump. Now, Harris is accusing his Democratic opponent, Dan McCready, of wanting to take legal steps to remove Trump from the Oval Office. ""In our debate, Dan McCready doubled down on his support for Pelosi’s liberal agenda of gun control, disrespecting our flag, and impeaching our President,"" Harris tweeted after a televised debate on Oct. 10. The tweet was shared more than 160 times. Is that really what McCready said? Let’s look at the tape. The full debate is available on the Charlotte Observer website. Part of the debate is also available on c-span.org, which also has a partial transcript to make the candidates’ comments more easily trackable. (C-Span missed the first few minutes of the debate because it was broadcasting other news) For this fact check, PolitiFact is choosing to focus on the most specific claim, that McCready wants to impeach Trump. If you watch the debate, though, you’ll see that McCready said he favors ""common sense"" gun background checks, without elaborating on what that policy might look like. And McCready said he stands for the flag but added that he understands that someone who’s faced discrimination may kneel ""because he or she doesn’t feel heard."" Pelosi and McCready McCready has repeatedly said he won’t vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker if Democrats gain control of the House. Harris, for his part, pushed back against McCready’s claim that he won’t support Pelosi as speaker, arguing that McCready’s individual vote for House speaker wouldn’t matter in the grand scheme of things. ""There’s a certain naivete, if you will, to think that you’ll go to Washington as a Democrat and not support Nancy Pelosi who frankly is spending that $350,000 ... to run negative ads against me,"" Harris said. ""There’s a reason for that. If Mr. McCready is elected, he just represents a number that would move the Democrats toward a majority."" If that happens, ""Nancy Pelosi has already done the math. She will become the speaker."" The back-and-forth occurs between the 27- and 30-minute marks of the C-Span video. Speaker or not, Pelosi herself hasn’t committed to impeaching Trump. Republicans this election season have raised the possibility that Democrats might impeach the president. But, as our friends at FactCheck.org noted in March, Pelosi hasn’t called for Trump’s impeachment and has voted to table two attempts at impeachment, effectively stopping them. With the election nearing, Pelosi has maintained her position that impeachment isn’t a priority, but she hasn’t ruled it out. McCready in the debate So what about McCready? Did he say in the debate that he’d vote to impeach Trump? Just before the 26-minute mark of the C-Span video, a moderator notes that Democrats could gain control of the House in this year’s elections. If that happens, some Democrats might try to impeach Trump. ""If you get elected, would you support that or would you not?"" the moderator asks. McCready didn’t offer a yes or a no. ""These kinds of decisions are very serious decisions and they’re decisions that need to be handled based on the facts and the evidence. As a small business owner, I don’t deal in hypotheticals, I deal in the facts,"" McCready said. ""That is a decision — or, any decision related to the Constitution — that I would treat very seriously based on the facts at the time."" Harris didn’t press McCready on impeaching Trump and the conversation moved on. Consistently noncommittal The Harris tweet says McCready in the debate ""doubled down"" on his support for impeaching Trump. But PolitiFact could find no evidence of McCready declaring that desire previously. In fact, several news articles noted that McCready is noncommittal about the prospect of impeachment, specifically. And he’s been criticized for being ""too vague."" In August, the Charlotte Observer quoted him saying the same phrase, ""I don’t deal in hypotheticals,"" that he used in the debate. Also in August, the New York Times wrote that McCready ""has shown little appetite to talk about impeachment."" The Times story noted, however, that California billionaire Tom Steyer, ""who has led a national pro-impeachment effort all year, has pledged $500,000 to aid"" McCready. Our ruling Harris tweeted that in his Oct. 10 debate with McCready, McCready ""doubled down on his support for Pelosi’s liberal agenda of ... impeaching our President."" McCready has consistently distanced himself from Pelosi. Regardless, neither Pelosi nor McCready has committed to impeaching Trump. By not opposing impeachment, they’ve left the door open to the idea. But that’s not the same as publicly stating it’s part of the Democratic or McCready agenda. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DA0CF40>],/factchecks/2018/oct/31/mark-harris-nc/dan-mccready-hasnt-said-hed-impeach-trump/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Jon Tester']","
Montana’s Matt Rosendale supports plans that don’t cover pre-existing conditions
","A popular feature of Obamacare is its ban on insurance companies denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. With health care shaping up as a major issue in the midterms, Democrats are now painting Republicans as opponents of this popular protection. ""Protections for pre-existing conditions are a matter of life or death,"" said Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., in a Facebook ad that featured a Montanan with a pre-existing condition. ""I’ve fought to protect coverage for pre-existing conditions, but Matt Rosendale supports plans that don’t have to cover them."" It turns out Rosendale has backed such plans. President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers’ rejiggering of the health care market has led to an increase of cheaper plans with fewer benefits. In August, the Trump administration issued a rule to permit insurance companies to extend the lifespan of short-term insurance plans. These so-called ""short-term, limited-duration"" plans, which were originally designed to fill temporary gaps in coverage for up to three months, are exempt from the pre-existing coverage rule. Under Trump, temporary plans can now last up to 364 days, and may be renewed up to three times. Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, voted to remove a tax penalty that Affordable Care Act applied to Americans who chose not to carry comprehensive coverage. The penalty drops off starting in 2019. These two measures opened the door for consumers to drop coverage altogether, or to buy ""short term"" plans, without penalty, that may be renewable up to three years and do not have to cover pre-existing conditions. Absent the pre-existing coverage provision, insurers have more leeway in crafting this class of insurance policy. Companies on the short-term market may choose not to insure, or not to renew, an applicant due to health conditions. Or they may charge higher premiums based on health status, gender or other factors. ""Carriers offering short-term or limited duration plans may say that they will cover someone that has pre-existing conditions,"" said Katherine Hempstead, a senior advisor at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. ""But then they will actually waive coverage for any health services related to those conditions.""   Insurance companies may also investigate a policyholder’s claim of illness or injury and make a retroactive finding that their ailment stemmed from a pre-existing condition, and therefore excluded from coverage. Proponents of short-term insurance point to its significantly lower cost, relative to ACA-compliant plans. ""Due to these limitations in coverage, short-term policies, not surprisingly, cost less than ACA-compliant major medical health insurance policies,"" the Kaiser Family Foundation wrote in April analysis. ""It is not uncommon to find the cheapest short-term policy priced at 20 percent or less of the premium for the lowest cost (Obamacare)-compliant plan."" The Tester campaign pointed us to multiple instances in which Rosendale celebrated Trump’s expansion of short-term plans. ""We are now getting ready to open up a lot of opportunities in 2019, thankfully, because President Trump signed an executive order extending the duration of short-term plans from 90 to 364 days,"" Rosendale told Breitbart News Tonight in August. ""Again, these are plans that don't have to have all of the Obamacare mandates, which most people don't want."" In that same interview, Rosendale hastened to add that he wants to make sure people with pre-existing conditions and others are able to gain coverage. We emailed the Rosendale campaign, which sent us links to news and opinion pieces that related to the candidate’s ideas about health care affordability and price transparency. But they did not specifically address how Rosendale would ensure people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage. An editorial in Montana’s largest newspaper, the Billings Gazette, took Rosendale to task for claiming to support protections for those with pre-existing conditions while endorsing short-term plans. The newspaper cited a study that estimated that a quarter of non-elderly Montana adults have a pre-existing condition that could disqualify them from coverage plans that do not comply with Obamacare. ""As the state’s insurance commissioner, Rosendale should know that the policies he supports do opposite of what he promised,"" the editorial read. ""He promotes the short-term policies that can reject Montanans who have pre-existing health conditions."" Tester said, ""Matt Rosendale supports plans that don’t have to cover (pre-existing conditions)."" Rosendale supports short-term plans that do not have to cover pre-existing conditions, and he welcomed their expansion under Trump. We rate this True.

Gubernatorial candidate Tony Evers ad inflates his grade on raising graduation rates to nearly 90%
","Republican Gov. Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Tony Evers have sparred over a wide-range of issues in the run-up to the Nov. 6 election. Among the most notable: Education. In June 2018, Walker proclaimed himself the ""education governor"" -- a not-so-subtle dig at Evers, who is state schools superintendent. ""We need to make sure that every student graduates here in the state of Wisconsin. That every student, no matter where they come from, what ZIP code they live in, graduates,"" Walker told reporters Sept. 4, 2018, at an event welcoming students back to classes at a school in Waukesha. Evers responded with a Sept. 25, 2018, TV ad that began with ominous music and the question: ""Do you trust Scott Walker on education?"" The ad went on to tout several claims about Evers’ achievements, including this one that we want to check: ""Tony raised graduation rates to nearly 90 percent."" Is he right? Digging into the numbers We started at the state Department of Public Instruction, which Evers has led since 2009, since it is the official keeper of such numbers. Department spokesman Thomas McCarthy pointed us toward WISEdash -- the Wisconsin Information System for Education Data Dashboard. There we found these graduation rates for the relevant years: 2009-’10 – 85.7 percent 
2010-’11 – 87 percent 
2011-’12 – 87.5 percent 2012-’13 – 88 percent 
2013-’14 – 88.6 percent 
2014-’15 – 88.4 percent 
2015-’16 – 88.2 percent 
2016-’17 – 88.6 percent So, that indicates a steady -- if slow -- increase. But what about for the real starting point -- the year before Evers took office? McCarthy said the numbers are not comparable, because with the 2009-’10 year, the state moved toward what is known as the ""adjusted cohort graduation rate."" It was created by the National Center for Education Statistics in an effort to address students who enter and leave a ""class"" before graduation. Previously, the graduation rate was calculated by using a freshman class as the baseline, compared to the number of graduates four years later. The rest of the country moved to this approach a year later than Wisconsin, in 2010-’11. Either way, the number did rise to nearly 90 percent -- but that is only part of the claim. The larger point made by Evers is that he and his policies are responsible -- even solely responsible -- for the gains. We have seen this sort of claim many times before, when politicians take credit -- or assign blame -- for things that beyond one person’s control. For instance, there was this Walker claim from earlier in the campaign: ""Our bold reforms have Wisconsin’s unemployment rate down to an all-time LOW of 2.9 percent, and the number of people working at an all-time HIGH!"" Walker’s numbers were largely on target, but experts said there were many other factors at work. We rated it Half True. What about the graduation rates? Alan J. Borsuk, senior fellow in law and public policy at Marquette Law School, said Evers can take some credit. ""Of course, it is the product of many factors, many people, and, ultimately, many students, parents and teachers doing well in their roles,"" said Borsuk, a former longtime education reporter at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""It's something to applaud. But it's a feather in the cap of whoever is at the top of the pyramid. And if the rates had gone down, critics and opponents would blame Evers.""    Borsuk noted that at times Walker has taken credit for improvements in student performance, and cautioned: ""In my book, both Evers and Walker are taking credit for things that have factual basis, but the role played by them individually or by actions they led is easy to overstate."" Meanwhile, McCarthy -- the department spokesman -- said Evers has focused on improving graduation rates since the beginning of his tenure. McCarthy cited the convening of a ""graduation summit,"" and Evers committing to the goal of ""Every child a graduate, college and career ready."" But he acknowledged that a central part of that plan, state grants for districts with the highest dropout rates, were not approved by Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature. Thus, the example undermines Evers’ claim that his actions alone increased the graduation rates. It shows support from other parts of support from other parts of state government are needed for funding and policy changes. Other initiatives cited by McCarthy included a ""continuous review"" of academic standards, a modernized data system that can ""help identify students likely to drop out"" and ""modernized assessments, including the ACT (college entrance test), that complement the data system in providing feedback to teachers and parents alike."" Our rating In a recent campaign ad, Evers says he has ""raised graduation rates to nearly 90 percent."" Evers took office in 2009. In the 2009-’10 year, the graduation rate was 85.7 percent. In  2016-’17, the most recent year available, it was 88.6 percent. But, like other politicians before him, Evers gets off track by giving himself too much credit for changes that have many factors, including -- perhaps especially -- efforts at the local school district level. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E0CFE00>],/factchecks/2018/oct/31/tony-evers/gubernatorial-candidate-tony-evers-ad-inflates-his/

Donald Trump falsely claims Democrats 'oppose any effort to secure our border'
","As President Donald Trump campaigned in Wisconsin for Republicans seeking election in November, he turned to a repeated line of attack against Democrats on immigration. ""Democrats oppose any effort to secure our border,"" Trump said Oct. 24 in Mosinee, Wis., prompting boos from rally-goers. Trump went on to claim that construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall was underway: ""We started the wall, $1.6 billion, another $1.6 billion, and we have another, but we want to build it very quickly all at one time, and we'll get it done."" It’s Mostly False that his promised border wall is under construction — what’s in the works is replacement fencing. His claim that Democrats oppose any effort to secure the border is also untrue. Democrats generally oppose the border wall, saying it would be too expensive and not in line with Trump’s promise that Mexico would pay for it. But they favor other security measures, including more Border Patrol agents and technology surveillance. They’ve introduced and co-sponsored legislation toward those goals. And the $1.6 billion Trump claims is financing the border wall came from a $1.3 trillion spending package passed in the House and Senate with support from Democrats. The White House did not provide supporting evidence for Trump’s claim nor comment on the record. Trump in March reluctantly signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill, setting aside his threats to veto it because it did not include all the money he wanted for a border wall. The bill included $1.6 billion explicitly designated for new and replacement fencing along the southwest border. That amount also covered $38 million for border barrier planning and design, and $196 million for acquisition and deployment of border security technology. Although the appropriations bill said the money was for fencing, Trump has touted it as being money for the wall he promised. In his claims, he’s left out that some Democrats supported the measure. The spending package passed in the Senate, 65-32, with 39 Democrats voting in its favor. In the House, it passed 256-167, with 111 Democrats supporting it. Democrats have criticized a full-length version of Trump’s proposed border wall as a waste of money. Instead most have pushed for other ways to secure the border. They also opposed a June immigration bill introduced by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., (which Trump initially supported). Aside from border wall funding, Goodlatte’s bill included cuts to legal immigration and allowed so-called Dreamers to stay in the United States on a renewable nonimmigrant status. Democrats and moderate Republicans said the bill did not offer a permanent solution for Dreamers. Over the years, Democrats have sponsored and supported proposals to help secure the border and voted in favor of appropriation bills funding U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the federal agency in charge of enforcing immigration laws at the border. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York in 2013 sponsored a bill directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit two reports on border security strategy, including one on where fencing, infrastructure and technology should be used; authorized the use of the National Guard to help secure the border; called for an increase in the number of Border Patrol agents at the southern border, and other border security measures. The Senate passed the bill but it was not taken up in the House. More recently, 30 Democrats co-sponsored a House bill introduced in January by Republican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas. The bill intended to protect Dreamers from deportation. It also called for the deployment of ""the most practical and effective technology"" to achieve operational control of the border. Within a year of the bill’s enactment, it directed the Department of Homeland Security to submit to Congress a comprehensive southern border strategy that included details on physical barriers, levees, technologies, tools, and other devices to secure the border. Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware and the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona in February sponsored legislation similar to Hurd’s House version. That proposal also authorized $110 million per year for five years for collaboration between local law enforcement and CBP. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., in January said that while the border wall was ""a monumental waste of taxpayers’ money,"" he would be in favor of it if that’s what it took to help Dreamers. Trump said, ""Democrats oppose any effort to secure our border."" Trump’s broad swipe fails to capture other actions under border security that Democrats have supported. Democrats have sponsored and backed legislation for border security, including surveillance technology. Trump also claims that the border wall is under construction and that he got $1.6 billion from Congress for it, but leaves out that Democrats also voted in favor of that appropriation. Trump’s claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E7C1440>],/factchecks/2018/oct/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-claims-democrats-oppose-any-e/
"['Health Care', 'Medicare', 'North Carolina', 'Linda Coleman']","
Linda Coleman’s comments on seniors and health care, explained
","As the midterm elections draw closer, Democrats across the country are narrowing their focus on a single key issue: health care. In North Carolina’s 2nd Congressional District, which includes parts of Franklin, Johnston, Wake, Nash and Harnett counties, Democrat Linda Coleman has taken frequent aim at incumbent George Holding for his repeated attempts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. During a town hall in Wake County Friday, Coleman listed the many changes that would have taken effect had the GOP’s American Health Care Act of 2017, which passed the House before failing in the Senate, actually become law. One change she mentioned made our ears perk up. ""Seniors can be charged five times what anybody else is charged for health care for pre-existing conditions,"" Coleman said. The Coleman campaign pointed to an article from the AARP to support her claim.  ""George Holding voted for the American Health Care Act which, had it passed, would have made it so that seniors could be charged 5-to-1 for their premiums,"" campaign manager Mimi Wilson said in an email. Coleman, a former state representative, is not the first Democratic candidate to make this claim. In September, U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., said she had voted against such a provision when she said no to the AHCA — a claim PolitiFact rated Half True. Before that, PolitiFact awarded another Half True to a health care advocacy group for claiming several Republican representatives had voted to let insurers ""charge five times more for people over 50.""   As PolitiFact noted then, the AHCA did include a provision that would have permitted insurance companies to charge older adults five times more than younger people, as Coleman said. But Coleman’s statement omitted several caveats that would give a slightly different impression. And while the related statements PolitiFact previously checked focused specifically on people older than 50, Coleman’s claim mentioned ""seniors"" more generally, making it more sweeping. There is no precise age of a senior, but Merriam-Webster defines it as an elderly person. Before the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, older adults paid about four or five times the premiums charged to younger adults for the same coverage, according to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care.  The Affordable Care Act changed the game by putting a cap on the amount that insurance companies could spike premiums for older adults. Under the new rules, insurers could charge older adults no more than three times the amount paid by younger adults. But Section 135 of the AHCA would have increased the cap so insurance companies could have charged some people older than 50 up to five times what younger adults had to pay. The same provision would have also allowed states to set their own standards. So Coleman has a point that Republicans tried to let insurance companies charge older Americans five times what they charged younger people. What she did not say, however, is that the Affordable Care Act already allows insurance companies to charge older people three times as much. By omitting this caveat, she may have led listeners to believe that the 5-to-1 ratio was a more drastic change than it really was. It’s also worth noting that the GOP proposal would have only affected older adults who had purchased insurance on the Affordable Care Act’s individual exchange market — another fact Coleman did not mention. Coleman also goes too far by saying ""seniors"" would be the ones impacted by the change. In fact, the 5-to-1 ratio would not have applied to the majority of seniors who get coverage from Medicare or to older people who get coverage through their employer. That said, the Republicans’ AHCA would have increased health care costs for older adults in another way, by replacing income-based tax credits with a credit based on age. The proposed tax credits for adults over 60 were only twice the amount adults under 30 would have received. This would have meant smaller credits for elderly people than under the status quo. According to AARP calculations, older adults making $25,000 per year would have earned tax credits that were 50 to 80 percent smaller, on average, than under current law. Coleman said that under the GOP repeal bill, ""Seniors can be charged five times what anybody else is charged for health care for pre-existing conditions."" She has a point that the AHCA would have allowed insurance companies to charge adults between the ages of 50 and 64 up to five times what they charged others for the same coverage. But Coleman’s use of the word ""seniors"" is too broad and potentially misleading, and her statement omitted at least three key points: Under the status quo, insurance companies can already charge older adults three times what they charge younger adults. The bill’s provision would not have applied to seniors receiving their insurance from Medicare or older adults with employer-provided coverage, which is how most older people get their coverage. The bill’s provision would have let states implement their own ratios separate from the 5-to-1 default. Overall, Coleman’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.

"['National', 'Campaign Finance', 'National Republican Congressional Committee']","
The link between George Soros and Dan Feehan is weak, no matter what the ad says
","Some people’s names take on special meaning, and when they are mentioned, those in the know nod in recognition. Take George Soros. The name of the Hungarian-born philanthropist, hedge fund manager and major liberal donor stands for things to some in the Republican Party, namely, ultra-liberal ideals and a willingness to spend millions of dollars to back them. That quickly brings us to an ad from the National Republican Congressional Committee, which wants a GOP candidate, Jim Hagedorn, to win an open seat in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District. Thus, the NRCC ad, one of two made in quick succession with similar themes, seeks to tie the Democratic candidate in the race, Dan Feehan, to Soros. We at PolitiFact deal with claims made through words, so we will not be ruling on the ad’s visual that show cartoonish mounds of money piled in front of the billionaire -- and Colin Kaepernick, the protesting former quarterback, right next to Soros, with masked mobs in front of him. But the words, spoken by an announcer, say, ""Soros’ billions bankroll the resistance and Dan Feehan. Feehan's employed by a Soros-funded liberal outfit in D.C."" and his campaign is ""propped up by out of state super PACs backed by Soros' millions."" Does Feehan work for a ""Soros-funded liberal outfit,"" and is his campaign ""propped up"" by PACs backed by Soros? The claim is inaccurate, despite what NRCC Chairman Steve Stivers said when he defended the ad on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" last Sunday: ""That ad is a factual ad."" We’ll explain why that’s not right, but here’s a hint: Feehan isn’t a fulltime employee of the think tank the ad links him to. Even if he were, it would be fairer to say that a major defense contractor and the United States government are bigger current funders of the think tank than Soros -- and President Donald Trump’s defense secretary used to serve on the board and very much likes the center’s work. Feehan is a combat veteran of the Iraq war, a former teacher and a former acting assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration. He does research and writing as an adjunct senior fellow for the Center for a New American Security. The center told us this means he contributes to research and gets paid on a per-project basis, and his compensation suggests as much: As of Aug. 13, his candidate’s financial disclosure listed $55,412 in income from ""research/writing"" for the center this year and $7,916 from last year. Some full-time senior fellows at the center, in contrast, were making as much as $172,000 to $197,000 in 2016, forms filed with the IRS show. The think tank has been characterized as liberal because of its founding by two Democratic foreign policy experts. But in an article for Vox, it was also described as rather centrist, representing ""the old George H.W. Bush view on foreign policy; some people would say it’s the Hillary Clinton view — it’s just where the US government has been for a very long time."" The Los Angeles Times in 2013 called the center ""respected"" and ""a haven for hawkish Democrats."" The Center for a New American Security has a fan in James Mattis, Trump’s defense secretary. Mattis was on the center’s board before going back into service for the government. The center’s website quotes him as saying the center ""understands the importance of all American citizens with worthy ideas in the national security conversation."" Other board members include James Murdoch, son of Rupert Murdoch and CEO of 21st Century Fox; former Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut independent, and Richard L. Armitage, a foreign policy adviser to presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. The center’s president, Richard Fontaine, was a foreign policy adviser to the late Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican. Soros has donated to the center through his Open Society Foundations. Open Society spokesman Jonathan Kaplan told us that since 2014, the foundations have given $1.5 million to the center. ""These grants supported research on preventing war with North Korea, the use of armed drone strikes, and U.S. foreign military assistance and human rights issues,"" he said in an email. More context is useful for understanding this. According to the center’s IRS filings, it got $12.2 million in gifts, grants and contributions from all sources in 2016 alone, $14.6 million in 2015 and $8.5 million in 2014. IRS filings for 2017 were not available, but information disclosed by the center shows that in the 12 months between Oct. 1, 2016 and Sept, 30, 2017, the Open Society Foundations gave the center between $250,000 and $499,000. That put Soros in the same donor category as the Boeing Corp., Johns Hopkins University and the Smith Richardson Foundation, which supports conservative and neoconservative causes such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution, according to Inside Philanthropy. Who gave more? The center’s website puts contributions in categories, and the category for the deepest donations is $500,000 and above. In the last fiscal year, only these three were on the list: Northrop Grumman, the giant defense contractor; the United States government, and Michael J. Zak, the center’’s board chairman and the principle investor at Charles River Ventures. Soros has not donated to Feehan’s campaign directly. But when we asked the NRCC for backup to support its claim, it listed Priorities USA, a major super PAC supporting Democrats. Soros has given Priorities USA $5 million for 2018, our check of Federal Election Commission records confirms, making him the PAC’s second biggest donor (behind Donald Sussman, of the hedge fund Paloma Partners). Priorities USA in turn has spent at least $103,452 running digital ads to oppose Hagedorn, the Republican whom Feehan is running against. The NRCC also listed a super PAC affiliated with House Democratic leaders, the House Majority PAC, which as of last week had spent $972,949 to oppose Hagedorn, running ads on TV and websites and sending direct mail to Minnesota homes, records show. Soros had not donated to the House Majority PAC in this election cycle. But the NRCC told us Soros gave nearly $2.2 million in 2016, and records confirm that. The National Republican Congressional Committee says that ""billionaire George Soros bankrolls"" Dan Feehan, who is ""employed by a Soros-funded liberal outfit in D.C."" and his campaign is ""propped up by out of state super PACs backed by Soros' millions."" Soros is currently a major donor to a super PAC, Priorities USA, that is supporting Feehan through its ads criticizing Hagedorn. Beyond that, this claim falls apart. Feehan is an adjunct staff member at an ""outfit"" that has other funders who are quite generous, including major defense contractors. The center has been described as liberal in media accounts, but it has been described in other ways as well, and its past and present board members include people chosen for high ranks by Republican presidents, including Trump. Soros hasn't donated to Feehan and does not ""bankroll"" Feehan. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DBA5CC0>],/factchecks/2018/oct/30/national-republican-congressional-committee/link-between-george-soros-and-dan-feehan-weak-no-/
"['Arizona', 'Health Care', 'Martha McSally']","
Fact-checking Martha McSally on pre-existing conditions
","U.S. Rep. Martha McSally is promoting herself to Arizonans as someone who’s led the fight to guarantee insurance coverage for people with pre-existing health conditions. McSally, a Republican running for the state’s open Senate seat, says in a new ad that she is ""leading the fight to secure our border, force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions and protect girls and women from sex trafficking."" Has McSally, an Air Force veteran, led the fight to ""force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions""? That’s not what her voting record shows. McSally in 2015 voted for a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. In 2017, she voted for a repeal and replace bill that health care law experts say undermined the Affordable Care Act. It is the Affordable Care Act that forces insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. McSally is competing against Democratic U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who’s also taken credit for protecting Arizonans’ health coverage. (See our fact-checks of Sinema’s claims.) McSally has aligned with the Republican Party’s goal of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, the health care bill signed into law by former president Barack Obama. Before the Affordable Care Act, insurers were allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions (health problems people had before a new coverage started). Insurers also were able to charge higher premiums based on health status. The Affordable Care Act prohibited those practices, effectively forcing companies to insure people with pre-existing conditions. McSally in February 2015 voted for a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. The bill directed House committees to offer new legislative proposals, including one with a provision to ""provide people with pre-existing conditions access to affordable health coverage."" That bill passed the House, 239-186, but died in the Senate. In May 2017, McSally also voted in favor of the American Health Care Act, a Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. It passed the House, 217-213, but again, failed in the Senate. McSally and other Republicans say that although they want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, they also want to protect people with pre-existing conditions. McSally’s campaign spokeswoman, Torunn Sinclair, said McSally ""played a large role"" behind the scenes in the American Health Care Act’s amendment process. ""Especially by setting the tone with leadership and other members that pre-existing conditions must be protected,"" Sinclair said. The American Health Care Act said nothing in it ""shall be construed as permitting health insurance issuers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions."" But it also allowed states to apply for waivers to certain Affordable Care Act rules. In states with a ""community rating"" waiver, insurers would have been able to raise premiums, for one year, for people with pre-existing health conditions who did not have coverage for at least 63 straight days the previous year. The Congressional Budget Office in a 2017 analysis said that less-healthy people, including those with pre-existing conditions, would ultimately be unable to buy individual health insurance (policies not tied to an employer) at premiums comparable to those under the Affordable Care Act, ""if they could purchase it at all."" During the 2017 debate for the American Health Care Act, McSally ""successfully negotiated $8 billion in additional funding to bring down insurance costs for people with pre-existing conditions,"" her campaign said. McSally supported a last-minute measure known as the Upton-Long amendment to help secure enough votes to pass the American Health Care Act in the House. The amendment, offered by Republican Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan and Billy Long of Missouri, made available $8 billion over five years to states granted a community rating waiver. The funds were intended to help reduce premiums or other out-of-pocket medical expenses for people with pre-existing conditions whose monthly premiums increased because of the waiver. Analyses and news reports at the time said it was uncertain how many states would apply for the waiver; the number would tell how the $8 billion would be allocated. Health care law experts say McSally’s claim overlooks protections established by the Affordable Care Act, downplays the impact of the American Health Care Act, and overstates the Upton-Long amendment’s reach. The Republican measures would not have forced insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions — they already had to because of the Affordable Care Act. The American Health Care Act, on the contrary, weakened coverage protections, experts said. ""The AHCA’s state waivers would have made it much more expensive and, in some cases, effectively impossible for people with pre-existing conditions to obtain coverage,"" said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in Brookings Institution’s Economic Studies Program. The Upton-Long amendment ""did very little to undo those adverse effects,"" Fiedler said. The amendment could be helpful to some extent, ""but offering a moderate level of financial assistance falls well short of ‘forcing’ insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions,"" said David Gamage, a law professor at Indiana University Maurer School of Law. ""The bottom line is that the American Health Care Act undermined the ability of people with pre-existing conditions to be able to maintain adequate coverage at affordable price,"" said Allison K. Hoffman, a law professor at Penn Law School. ""And then amendments like the Upton-Long amendment tried to soften the blow of some of these harms."" The proposal said nothing in it was to be construed as permitting insurers to limit coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions. But experts said that was ""vague catch-all language,"" and that the bill included avenues for states to undermine that coverage. McSally claimed she’s ""leading the fight"" to ""force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions."" It was the Obama-era Affordable Care Act that forced insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions. McSally in 2015 voted in favor of a full repeal of the law. The bill directed House committees to offer new proposals, including one that provided people with pre-existing conditions access to affordable health coverage. In 2017, McSally voted for the American Health Care Act, a Republican proposal that kept the Affordable Care Act’s pre-existing conditions coverage. Despite language in the bill to protect people with pre-existing conditions, it included provisions that undermined that coverage and increased premiums for certain people, making insurance unaffordable in some cases, experts said. McSally did support an amendment to help reduce over 5 years increased premiums and out-of-pocket expenses that people with pre-existing conditions might face due to a state waiver allowed in the bill. McSally’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'John Culberson']","
Lizzie Fletcher does not want government-funded universal health care as Culberson ad claims
","A new ad from John Culberson, a nine-term Republican congressman from Texas, takes an ad from his opponent Lizzie Pannill Fletcher and uses her own words against her. Culberson is looking to hold onto his seat in the state’s 7th Congressional District, which covers a portion of western Houston. His campaign aired the ad ""Orders"" which puts up a Fletcher ad and compares it to comments she made in a debate. The 30-second slot begins with a clip of Fletcher in her ad saying she doesn’t ""support a government takeover of health care."" Then, it immediately switches to a clip of Fletcher in a debate saying ""we need universal health care."" With such a stark contrast, we wondered whether Fletcher had backtracked on her position, as the ad makes it appear. While universal health care refers to any system where all residents have health coverage, it is best connected, at least right now, to the single-payer plan ""Medicare for All"" that was proposed in 2017 by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. So does Fletcher support a government-supported, universal single-payer system like Medicare for All? No. The debate clip is cut, and takes Fletcher out of context by not revealing her full quote. We also found Fletcher has voiced opposition to such a program several times. Under Sanders’ plan, the country would eliminate the current system of multiple insurers competing for premiums. Instead, the government would expand Medicare, a federally tax-payer supported program, to cover everyone, rather than just those age 65 and older. Backers say the plan would end up saving people money, because it would cut administrative costs, help slow the increase in health care spending and improve access. But skeptics argue that it would be too costly for the federal government, result in lower quality care and would amount to a ""government takeover"" of health care. We tracked down the full video of the debate from May 2018, and found that Fletcher was responding to her Democratic primary opponent at the time, Laura Moser, who had said she backed a single-payer program like ""Medicare for All"". Fletcher disagreed. Fletcher did say ""we need universal health care"" but if you continue to watch, you see that’s not exactly what she meant. ""We need universal health care. Not just health care coverage, not just health care insurance, but that we all need access to health care,"" she goes on to say. Fletcher then discusses her support of keeping the Affordable Care Act and adding a public option to buy into Medicare – not Medicare for All or any other single-payer plan. ""There has been extensive study that the plan Bernie Sanders has proposed will cost $32 trillion over 10 years,"" Fletcher said, ""and we don’t know how we’re going to pay for it."" (She is referring to a study from the Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank at George Mason University, that estimated Medicare for All would increase the demand for health care services while also cutting payments to providers. The report suggests the system would cost $32 trillion over the next 10 years) The Fletcher campaign also told us she has never advocated for a ""complete government takeover"" of health care. That checks out. We looked into Fletcher’s stance on health care and reviewed various reports, as well as her remarks in interviews and information on her campaign website. In every instance, Fletcher has repeated that she wants to build on the Affordable Care Act, and has not endorsed any single-payer health care system, including Medicare for All. The Culberson campaign defended the ad by saying that universal health care isn’t universal access to health care. ""Because health care is already available to everyone in America – you just have to pay for it,"" said Culberson spokesperson Catherine Kelly. ""Her plan is more expensive than Medicare for All because it raises taxes on people who want to keep their coverage and gives it to people to anyone who wants to 'opt in.’"" Culberson attempts to display Fletcher contradicting herself on her health care position. But the ad uses an incomplete sound bite that ultimately takes Fletcher out of context. Fletcher did use the words ""universal health care,"" and has so in the past, but not in the context of a single-payer or ""Medicare for All"" type health plan. Fletcher has advocated for improvements to the Affordable Care Act and a public option to buy into Medicare,  not through a government-funded single-payer type of program. The ad uses an incomplete sound bite that ultimately misleads viewers on her stance. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E36D700>],/factchecks/2018/oct/30/john-culberson/lizzie-fletcher-does-not-want-government-funded-un/

Fact-checking immigration claim in California Insurance Commissioner race
","Democratic State Sen. Ricardo Lara, who is running for California Insurance Commissioner, showcased his opponent’s past stance on immigration in recent full-page newspaper ads in Sacramento and the Central Valley. This claim from the ads caught our attention: ""As Insurance Commissioner, Steve Poizner pledged to block immigrant children from ever getting MediCal health insurance."" The Ricardo Lara for Insurance Commissioner 2018 campaign produced the ad above.  Poizner, who served as insurance commissioner from 2007 to 2011, is running for the open position this year after switching his party affiliation from Republican to Independent. The incumbent, Democrat Dave Jones, is termed out. California’s insurance commissioner regulates the insurance industry and implements state law, but does not create it. We wanted to know whether Lara’s claim about Poizner was accurate. We set out on a fact check. Our research When asked about the claim, Lara’s campaign consultant Richie Ross pointed to a campaign ad from Poizner's 2010 run for governor, when he took several hard-line stances on immigration. The ad shows a car crashing off a cliff, as Poizner says: ""We all know California is heading right over a cliff. How did this happen? Years of liberal failure doing too much for too many. Take illegal immigration: Politicians have lacked the guts to tackle the problem. As governor, I will stop taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal immigrants.""  In the ad, Poizner doesn’t specifically bring up health benefits, but instead makes the blanket pledge to stop all benefits for undocumented Californians. Changed positions In April, Poizner told newspaper editorial boards he’s changed some of his positions on immigration. ""I regret the tone and direction that we took in that campaign,"" he said in an interview with the Bay Area News Group editorial board this week, calling his approach in that race ""wrong and harmful."" Poizner told the editorial board that he now believes everyone who’s undocumented should be ""put on a path to get documented,"" and young people in the DACA program should be eligible for U.S. citizenship, The Mercury News reported. He also told the San Francisco Chronicle editorial board he no longer wants to cut tuition benefits to undocumented immigrants. Poizner said he took his previous anti-immigrant positions while under ""huge pressure"" in a competitive primary race against former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, according to the newspaper. Poizner’s campaign did not respond to three requests from PolitiFact California on where he stands on the specific issue of providing health benefits to undocumented children. During his time in the Legislature, Lara has worked to expand health coverage to all undocumented Californians. In 2015, Gov. Jerry Brown signed Lara's Health For All Kids Act 2015, which gave Medi-Cal coverage to undocumented kids and teens. Our ruling  Democratic State Sen. Ricardo Lara claimed in full-page newspaper ads that his opponent in California’s Insurance Commissioner race, Steve Poizner, ""pledged to block immigrant children from ever getting MediCal health insurance,"" when Poizner previously held the state post. Poizner did make a general promise to block benefits for undocumented Californians, though that was eight years ago, in a Republican primary race for governor. He said in an ad: ""I will stop taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal immigrants,"" though he didn’t specify the kind of benefits. Notably, Lara’s statement ignores Poizner’s shift on immigration. Poizner told newspapers this spring he now favors some benefits for undocumented Californians and a path to citizenship for DACA recipients, and that his past approach was ""harmful."" Poizner’s campaign did not respond to requests about his stance on health benefits for undocumented children, leaving his position on that unclear. In the end, we found there’s some truth to Lara’s statement, but it leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate it  Half True.

Rick Scott wants to go back to denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, Charlie Crist says
","Former Gov. Charlie Crist is a very rare breed of a candidate running in a competitive statewide race: He’s in love with Obamacare, and he’s not afraid to say it. In fact, it’s terrible that Gov. Rick Scott is against the law, Crist says, in a new online video responding to Scott. ""The truth is Rick Scott wants to take us back to the days of insurance companies denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, where women are charged more than men, and lifetime caps limit care, even for kids with cancer."" Several opponents of the law say they want to scrap it but keep elements they support -- for example, banning insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, one of the most popular elements of the law. We wanted to check what Scott has said in the past about pre-existing conditions. We asked Crist’s campaign for documentation that Scott is in favor of denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Former Sen. Steve Geller, an informal adviser to Crist’s campaign, cited newspaper reports that stated Scott had failed to propose an alternative to the health care law. We asked Scott’s campaign for his position on pre-existing conditions. Spokesman Greg Blair pointed to a July 2012 interview Scott gave to Newsmax, a conservative news outlet: ""If you’re worried about pre-existing conditions, give the individual the same tax breaks as an employer so when you change jobs, you don’t lose your health insurance, just like you don’t lose your life insurance if you have your own policy,"" Scott said. Scott made similar remarks in July 2012: ""Give individuals the same tax breaks as employers so they can buy their own insurance so they won't have to deal with the pre-existing conditions."" We weren’t sure how tax breaks would end exclusions for pre-existing conditions, and Blair declined to elaborate on Scott’s proposal. Health care experts  We sent Scott’s quote about tax breaks to health care experts and asked if that would be a solution to pre-existing conditions. They told us that if the 2010 health law disappeared, a 1996 law protects most people from denial after gaps of less than 63 days. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act established that time frame. That means if you lose coverage but get new coverage within the 63-day window, you don’t have to worry about pre-existing conditions. And insurers can only look back 18 months for coverage gaps. But if you go without insurance for longer than 63 days, then the experts told us that Scott’s tax breaks don’t help you. Mark Pauly, a professor of public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, said a tax break has no direct connection to covering pre-existing conditions. ""Giving Gov. Scott the benefit of the doubt for lack of artfulness, I think he was referring to proposals that would give ‘portability’ to people who had obtained group coverage so they could continue that coverage (and its tax break) even if they went to self employment or a job in a company not offering coverage. ... The general idea (is) that you can continue your coverage without being singled out for ‘re-underwriting’ if you had continuous coverage."" Insured people in poor health are more likely to lose their coverage from one year to the next if it is employment-based coverage rather than individual coverage, he said. Policy experts disagree on just how helpful Scott’s proposal would be. Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian CATO Institute, said Scott’s suggestion ""is part of a long-term solution that I think would do a very good job of dealing with the problem. In the end some people would probably still fall through cracks, but for most people with pre-existing conditions, this solves the problem."" On the other hand, Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina said that by themselves, tax credits do little to help people with pre-existing conditions. ""A limited tax credit will not help someone with cancer get coverage unless there are protections in place that compel insurance companies to take all customers regardless of their medical condition and that prevent insurers from charging exorbitant premiums to persons with pre-existing conditions,"" he said. Crist’s campaign told us that Scott is suggesting changes to federal tax law that governors don’t have a say in anyway. Despite Scott’s opposition to the health care law, it is still being implemented in Florida. As of February 440,000 Floridians signed up for plans, the most of any state using the federal exchange. Our ruling Crist said in a video, ""Rick Scott wants to take us back to the days of insurance companies denying coverage for pre-existing conditions."" There is no dispute that Scott has been a persistent critic of the health care law which banned insurance companies from refusing coverage due to pre-existing conditions. We could not find many comments from Scott about pre-existing conditions, and the two brief remarks we found didn’t explain his ideas in detail. Overall, Scott supports tax breaks that allow people to buy their own insurance, and if they keep themselves insured, they don’t have to worry about pre-existing conditions. But that would leave those who end up uninsured for more than a few months in danger of being denied coverage for pre-existing conditions. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A550840840>],/factchecks/2014/apr/04/charlie-crist/rick-scott-opposes-health-care-law-so-he-wants-go-/
"['Georgia', 'Women', 'Jimmy Carter']","
Carter exaggerates gender pay gap
","The scribes at PolitiFact Georgia thought they heard some familiar numbers when former President Jimmy Carter recently told a national television audience that women in the U.S. make much less than men for the very same work. Carter was promoting his new book, ""A Call to Action: Women, Religion, Violence, and Power.""  A former Georgia governor, Nobel Peace Prize winner and perhaps the nation’s best-known Sunday school teacher, Carter is also a prolific author. ""In the United States for the same exact work for a full-time employee, women get 23 percent less pay than men,"" Carter told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell in an interview that aired March 24. The so-called ""gender wage gap"" gets a lot of ink. PolitiFact has fact-checked various incarnations of the statistic Carter uses as the basis of his claim. Speakers have ended up all over the Truth-O-Meter depending on how accurately they framed the results of the study upon which the numbers are based. President Barack Obama ended up on the Truth-O-Meter for his take on the numbers during his 2012 campaign. He got a Mostly False ruling. Carter made a similar claim last year at a women’s conference in Atlanta. He told the conference that women in the United States are paid about 70 percent of what men earn for the same work. PolitiFact Georgia rated that statement Mostly False. Carter’s claim here is a bit different and more specific than the claim we checked last year. And this time, he was using the numbers to tout his book. PolitiFact Georgia decided to take another look. We reached out to Carter, and his assistant, Steven Hochman, emailed this about Carter’s television interview: ""In a conversation or an interview, sometimes we don’t say all we want to say. In the United States for the same exact work, most women earn less than men.  For full-time employees, the median annual earnings are about 23 percent less for women than for men."" Let’s start with a basic primer on wages and gender. Experts agree there is a gender-based wage gap. But it is not as simple as it seems. Differences in the life choices of men and women — such as women tending to leave the workforce when they have children — and other factors make it difficult to make simple comparisons. The number Carter used in his TV interview comes from a U.S. Census Bureau study that looked at the total wages earned by male and female workers. The study found men’s total wages were about 23 percent higher than the total amount of women's wages. But that large discrepancy was due in part to the fact that men generally work more hours. The study did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked. Other data -- including hourly wages tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as data comparing the same jobs -- yield smaller wage gaps. Experts say the figure, which is often used to bolster arguments for gender-based wage bias, is misleading. Advocates often use the Census Bureau report because it shows the largest wage gap. The number does not take into account critical factors that could influence the figure, including specific occupation, time on the job and education level. And the gap drops dramatically if you compare men and women of similar education levels, job titles, time on the job and other relevant factors. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis cited one survey, prepared for the Labor Department. It found that when such differences are accounted for, much of the hourly wage gap vanished. It shrinks to the low single digits. Carter’s public statements about the gender wage gap are also at odds with his book. On Page 168, Carter states that ""full-time female workers still earn about 23 percent less than men."" There is no mention here of less pay for the ""same exact work."" During his MSNBC interview, Carter took a legitimate statistic and described it in a way that makes it sound much more dramatic than it is. The 23 percent figure is real. But it does not factor in occupations held, hours worked or length of tenure. That statistic does not refer to the pay of women doing ""the same exact work"" as men. There is a gender pay gap. But Carter vastly overstated it during his television interview. We rate Carter’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A550678400>],/factchecks/2014/apr/04/jimmy-carter/carter-exaggerates-gender-pay-gap/

Charles Koch, in op-ed, says his political engagement began only in the last decade
","Following weeks of Democratic attacks -- including barbs from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. -- billionaire industrialist Charles Koch fired back with a response in the Wall Street Journal. In an op-ed on April 3, 2014, Koch called Reid’s comments disrespectful and a bad omen for democracy. He also defended the family company Koch Industries, one of the nation’s largest privately owned corporations. Koch said the fundamental concepts of equality before the law and personal freedom were under attack by government itself. ""That's why, if we want to restore a free society and create greater well-being and opportunity for all Americans, we have no choice but to fight for those principles,"" Koch wrote. ""I have been doing so for more than 50 years, primarily through educational efforts. It was only in the past decade that I realized the need to also engage in the political process."" We wondered whether Koch was accurate when he said that ""it was only in the past decade that I realized the need to also engage in the political process."" Koch drew a distinction between ""educational efforts"" and the ""political process."" Those categories, though, are somewhat fluid and subject to reasonable debate. For example, Charles Koch and his brother David made several large financial commitments prior to 2004 to free-market oriented groups such as the Cato Institute, the Reason Foundation, the Mercatus Center and Citizens for a Sound Economy, which was the pre-2004 precursor of Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks. Koch Industries also spent $2.6 million on federal lobbying between 1998 and 2003. Even if you set these expenditures aside, though, we found the Kochs have made many campaign contributions prior to 2004. Charles Koch, the author of the column, gave $54,500 to candidates or political committees before 2004, according to federal disclosure data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics and calculated by PolitiFact. That’s not a lot for a billionaire, though it’s not nothing, either. However, his brother and his company, both of whom have had ideological agendas closely aligned with his own, also gave money during that time -- a lot of it. Between 1989 and 2003, David Koch gave more than $1.7 million to candidates and political committees. And the political action committee of Koch Industries gave an additional $5.2 million to candidates and political committees over the same period. If you combine these totals -- and throw in political donations made by Koch Industries affiliates, as well as donations made by Koch-related entities at the state level -- then Charles, David and the PAC representing their privately held company collectively gave more than $7 million to candidates and political committees before 2004. And since then, they’ve spent much more. Robert A. Tappan, the director of external relations for Koch Companies Public Sector, told PolitiFact that the ""past decade"" reference ""refers to the ‘Koch Seminars’ that have been held since 2003. We use the seminars to bring together businesspeople, thought-leaders, philanthropists, academics, scientists, and public officials to discuss ideas and issues about how to make the U.S. more successful and to create a freer society, with policies and leaders focused on helping people improve their lives."" However, we don’t think most people would naturally assume that’s what Koch meant when he said he had only recently engaged in the political process. Our ruling Charles Koch wrote that ""it was only in the past decade that I realized the need to also engage in the political process."" Even if you ignore the deep reservoir of money Koch spent on ""educational"" and lobbying efforts -- expenditures that could plausibly be described as ""political"" -- Charles Koch personally gave a little more than $50,000 to candidates and political committees donations prior to 2004. And collectively, his brother and the PAC of the company they own directly supported candidates and political committees to the tune of $7 million over the same period. We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A550672C00>],/factchecks/2014/apr/03/charles-koch/charles-koch-op-ed-says-his-political-engagement-b/

Pro-McConnell group says the estate tax makes it hard for family farms to survive
","A group aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is airing a new ad in Kentucky that touts the Republican leader as a friend of farmers. The new 30-second spot, which began airing April 1, 2014, is part of a $1.8 million ad buy from the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition, which hopes to boost McConnell as he enters a primary challenge and re-election battle. It features a farmer who laments the impact of the ""death tax,"" known officially as the estate tax, on family farms. ""As a farmer there’s good years and bad,"" he says. ""The last thing we need is Washington making it harder on us. The death tax makes it harder for us to hand our farm on to our kids. Mitch McConnell has been fighting to end the death tax to help us keep our Kentucky family farms. For our family farms to survive, we’ve got to get in this fight."" McConnell (like many Republicans) is a staunch opponent of the estate tax, a tax on property transferred after death through an inheritance. It’s mostly viewed as a tax on wealthier individuals, but the pro-McConnell ad claims it threatens ""Kentucky family farms"" as well. Is that true? Recent history of the estate tax The estate tax was first established in 1916 to offset a decline in tariff revenue caused by the first World War, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Congress has tinkered with it many times throughout the years, especially during the past decade or so. In 2001, President George W. Bush signed legislation that created an exemption for the first $1.5 million of an inherited estate. The exemption increased for the next few years to $3.5 million with the intention of eliminating the estate tax completely in 2010. But the law was scheduled to sunset in 2011, along with the rest of the so-called Bush tax cuts. In 2010, Congress and President Barack Obama agreed to extend the Bush-era tax rates by two years, while also raising the exemption on the estate tax to $5 million in 2010 and indexing it to inflation for 2011 and 2012. Income after $5 million was taxed at 35 percent. In 2012, Congress and Obama compromised to keep the estate tax above $5 million but increased the tax rate to 40 percent. That’s where it sits today. You can see why this is viewed as a tax on the wealthy. The vast majority of Americans do not pass along estates to their children after death valued at greater than $1.5 million, let alone $5 million. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, in 2011 the top 1 percent of earners paid almost 80 percent of the estate taxes collected; the top 5 percent paid 97.6 percent. The small percentage who do pay the tax, however, face a stiff fee. The 3,200 estates with taxable returns in 2011 paid a combined $10.6 billion. Where do farmers fit in? Republicans and opponents of the estate tax have often held up farmers as an example of a population especially burdened by this levy. Because many farmers own a lot of land and expensive machinery, the values of their estate can add up quickly, they say, but many don’t have the money to pay the high tax and could risk losing their farm. Estimates, however, say that just a small percentage of farmers are actually affected by the tax. A 2005 study from the Congressional Budget Office estimated that if the exemption were set at $3.5 million in 2000, only 65 of the 4,640 farm estates filing returns that year would have surpassed the threshold needed to pay the estate tax. Of those, just 13 wouldn’t have enough money to pay their tax liability. More recently, the Tax Policy Center estimated that in 2011, with the exemption at $5 million, 120 farms and small businesses would have to pay the estate tax. Their total taxes paid equated to about 6.3 percent of all estate taxes collected that year. About 40 of these filings came from ""small farms or businesses,"" according to the analysis. Congress has built in a number of provisions throughout the years to assist farmers. For example, the exemption doubles if the farm is owned by a couple, even if one of the owners dies. ""The idea that if you’re married now you’re approaching $10 million, that’s a pretty hefty farm,"" said Bob Williams at the Tax Policy Center. There is also an exemption that allows closely held family farms a reduction of up to $1.5 million to bridge the gap between the value of their property at the ""current use value"" versus the ""highest and best use value."" If a farm does qualify for the estate tax, heirs also have 15 years to pay the tax. But taking advantage of these provisions comes at a price, said Don Williamson, executive director of the American University Kogod Tax Center, not the least of which is the cost of accountants and lawyers who understand the complexities of estate planning. Individuals that take advantage of certain provisions for closely held family farms also have to hold onto to the property for 10 years and use it for farming purposes. During that time the IRS places a lien on the property that makes it difficult to take out loans, said Williamson, who through his private practice has handled estate planning for farmers. Farms close to urban hubs are especially at risk of seeing large increases in the property value when compared to their value as a farm, Williamson added. Ongoing battle on the Hill In his most recent budget, Obama called on Congress to return the estate tax to 2009 levels when the exemption was $3.5 million and the tax rate was 45 percent. Obama’s administration said the country can no longer afford to keep the exemption at $5 million and the rate at 40 percent. However, it is unlikely Republicans who control the House are willing to renegotiate the terms of the 2012 compromise and increase the reach and the rates of the estate tax. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., has introduced a measure to eliminate the estate tax entirely. McConnell supports that idea, but it's equally unlikely to move forward. Ed Koren, a wealth and estate lawyer and an adjunct professor at the University of Miami Heckerling Estate Planning Institute, said where the exemption falls will ultimately determine how many farmers are affected. ""Certainly if compared to those who would like to take it back to the way it was in 2000, it’s absolutely true (that farmers are threatened), even if you take it back to what the Obama budget proposal has said, there’s some truth to it,"" Koren said. ""But it’s not that big of an issue if you keep the law where it’s at today."" Our ruling The Kentucky Opportunity Coalition ad said the estate tax is a threat to family farms. If the exemption levels are changed, more farmers could be affected. Bureaucratic and accounting hurdles to avoid the tax can be difficult to navigate without assistance. But most of the statistical evidence says that the vast majority of farms bequeathed to relatives don’t pay any estate taxes at the current exemption level. Even fewer are in a position where they can’t pay the liability. And there are provisions that make the payment process easier for farmers than other estate holders. Further, the estate tax generally most affects the very wealthy. Nearly 98 percent is paid by the top 5 percent of earners. The statement has an element of truth but leaves out important details that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E502DC0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/03/kentucky-opportunity-coalition/pro-mcconnell-group-says-estate-tax-makes-it-hard-/

Comptroller candidate Glenn Hegar favors ending property taxes, didn’t promise he’d do it
","The Democratic nominee for Texas comptroller says the Republican nominee, state Sen. Glenn Hegar of Katy, made a taxing promise. Mike Collier of Houston said in a March 18, 2014, email blast, ""Glenn Hegar promised to eliminate the property tax,"" a step Collier said would trigger the state’s ""most outrageous tax increase"" ever. Hegar’s alternative to the property tax, Collier wrote, would require sales taxes ""to be at least 20 percent -- and possibly as high as 25 percent"" to pay for local needs such as ""schools and county roads ... water and sewage treatment"" and more. For this article, we’re setting aside what happens should property taxes go away. But did Hegar promise to kill property taxes? Broadly, no single official including the comptroller can abolish property taxes, which are levied by cities, counties, school districts and other taxing units. Abolition would take legislation passed into law and maybe a voter-adopted amendment to the Texas Constitution. Republicans including Debra Medina and Raul Torres, among comptroller candidates defeated by Hegar in the 2014 primary, have voiced support for getting rid of property taxes; Medina pitched replacing property taxes with expanded sales taxes as far back as her 2010 gubernatorial bid. In fact, the Texas GOP party platform, adopted at the party’s 2012 convention, says, ""We encourage abolishing property taxes (and) shifting the tax burden to a consumption-based tax,"" as Dale Craymer, president of the business-oriented Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, noted in an email exchange with us. As we embarked on this fact check, we noticed Hegar’s campaign website doesn’t discuss property taxes. We also asked for an interview with Hegar about any promise to wipe out property taxes; campaign manager David White told us by email that Hegar wasn’t available on the couple days we inquired. White also said he was unaware of Hegar directly promising to eliminate property taxes. White emailed us an excerpt from Hegar’s Dec. 31, 2013, response to a questionnaire from the Dallas Morning News in which Hegar referred to ""an antiquated system of property tax collection. While I prefer a shift to more of a consumption-based tax system, (I) know that we are many years away from being able to implement such."" Collier spokesman Jason Stanford, asked for evidence of such a Hegar promise, emailed us Hegar’s Jan. 20, 2014, answers to a Collin County Conservatives questionnaire and a Feb. 5, 2014, Killeen Daily Herald/Temple Daily Telegram news story on GOP comptroller candidates’ Feb. 4, 2014, debate in Salado. Neither showed Hegar promising to abolish property taxes, but both described his support for gradually reaching that goal. ""I support a shift from the property tax toward a consumption tax system. I believe a consumption tax is the fairest, most transparent tax system,"" Hegar wrote in the questionnaire. (Consumption taxes are those levied when a person spends money on a product or service.) According to the news story on the Salado debate, Hegar, Medina and Torres all ""said they were in favor of completely phasing out property taxes."" Stanford also pointed us to a video clip the Collier campaign posted online, which it also began using in a video ad that debuted April 1, that comes from the Jan. 6, 2014, meeting of a Longview tea party group.  Collier’s website links to a longer video recording of the event, posted to YouTube by the Longview group. Here’s our transcript of two property-tax answers from Hegar, bolding the words Collier included in his video ad: Audience member: I would just like to know your thoughts on ending the property tax and replacing it with something along the lines of a consumption tax or something, so we can finally own our property? Hegar: That -- well, you took the words with your last statement: so you can own your property. Because you really don’t. The government owns it. The question is how much do you pay rent. I tell you, I don’t like the property tax, never have. I think we should replace it. The best thing to replace it with is a consumption-type tax, sales tax per se. I was up -- I was talking to somebody the other day about it,  and the question is, is what would that number be. Oh, I know what it was: I got it on a questionnaire, one of the tea party groups. And they said, ‘Well, what steps do you take?’ and I said, ‘Steps? You just do it.’  That’s the only way you get there. You know, I know the votes have not been in the Legislature a few sessions ago in order to try to get rid of it. But the fact is as comptroller, I have said numerous times -- or, running as -- that is the only fair way. Because the question is, who pays? Everybody pays. And you actually, when you buy that loaf of bread or whatever be it, you pay the tax and guess what? You get to walk away with the bread. You don’t have to bring the last four loaves back. And that’s kind of what it is with your property. … Different audience member: … There’s a lot of people my age that aren’t going to own property any time soon, so what kind of -- what do you have to say to them? That they have to pay, we have to pay higher taxes on the things we consume? But we don’t own property. Hegar: Well to me, it’s still a fairness, I mean you’re, you’re here in Texas and so the fact is is you pay sales tax today. You pay a portion of the tax. But you may not pay all of it, and so should we favor one set of folks because they may not own property versus other people? No, the fact is, is the landowners, if you look at local property, as in a school district, they’re paying half of it. Well, why shouldn’t it be distributed among everybody and not just based only on the landowners? And you treat all landowners the same; you don’t pick and choose winners and losers. (Applause.) I mean I -- I just think -- and the reason I said earlier is, you know, business, people, you fill in, Texans should succeed on their own merits and you shouldn’t be picking winners and losers, and that winners and losers, if that means that younger people because they don’t own their home, then that puts a greater burden on them, and compare the current system, maybe it does, but it’s fair. That’d be my personal opinion. Stanford told us that by using the phrase ""Just do it,"" Hegar ""may not have said the words ‘I promise,’ but he explained how he would"" eliminate property taxes. Another tea party video the Collier campaign is publicizing shows Hegar both describing obstacles and spelling out the role he would take. Collier says on his website the video shows Hegar proposing a sales tax rate of up to 18.5 percent to cover cuts in property taxes. In the full interview, posted online Dec. 31, 2013, by the Montgomery County Tea Party, Hegar said that in replacing the property tax with a sales tax, ""the hardest question to answer for the Legislature that puts it into place, No. 1, is obviously getting the votes to do it."" After that, ""then the biggest question is, is that one (tax) that you broaden the base, as in what is taxable for consumption, or is it the rate? And that’s where the numbers get really hard,"" he said. ""Maybe you’ve heard wild percentages."" Starting with the existing state sales tax of 6.25 percent plus local sales tax of up to 2 percent, Hegar said, ""does that go up 3 percent, 18 percent? Up to 18.5 percent, some numbers have been out. But the question is how wide and how broad is that. And that’s where the Legislature has seemed to get caught up."" Asked how the comptroller could influence legislators, Hegar told the tea-party group, ""I think the comptroller’s role should use more of what’s called a dynamic fiscal note,"" a type of report that he said can be used to show the opportunities presented by a tax cut, such as eliminating property taxes, rather than only presenting its negative effect on state revenues. The note is ""something that I would definitely utilize,"" he said. Our ruling Collier said, ""Glenn Hegar promised to eliminate the property tax."" Hegar has said that as comptroller, he would ""definitely"" use a dynamic fiscal note to encourage the policy change, but he also has spoken about the difficulties of reaching an approach that wins legislative favor. We rate Collier’s statement as False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E72D040>],/factchecks/2014/apr/03/mike-collier/comptroller-candidate-glenn-hegar-favors-ending-pr/

Heather McGhee: Less than 1% of 1% give $200 or more to campaigns
","The U.S. Supreme Court decision to throw out a key campaign donation limit unleashed a wave of predictions that the domination of big money will only increase. What the court did on April 2 was say a single donor can give to as many candidates, party funds and political action committees as he or she might desire. Limits are still in place for how much you can give to any individual candidate -- $2,600 -- or a state party -- $10,000 -- and so forth, but so long as there are campaign committees you want to support, you can keep on giving. Before the court’s ruling, there was an overall cap of $123,200. Heather McGhee, president of Demos, a group that believes too much political and economic power lies in the hands of too few people, said the McCutcheon vs. FEC decision makes a bad situation worse. ""We have a large donor dominated system,"" McGhee said on MSNBC. ""Less than 1 percent of 1 percent of the American population has given an amount over $200."" If McGhee is correct, then that’s a tiny sliver indeed. It would mean 0.01 percent of the public gives over $200 to political campaigns. With a population of about 314 million, that translates into 31,400 people or roughly the population of Juneau, Alaska. The Center for Responsive Politics has tracked federal campaign donations for many years. According to their latest data, 366,000 people have given $200 or more so far in the 2013-14 election cycle. That’s about 10 times more than 31,400. It’s worse news for McGhee if you look at the 2012 election. That year, over 1.2 million people gave $200 or more to a federal candidate, a party, or a PAC. As a percentage, that’s 0.4 percent. When we brought this to the attention of the people at Demos, spokesman Alex Amend faced up to the gaffe. ""Heather misspoke — the correct percentage of Americans giving over $200 to political campaigns is 0.12% of the population,"" Amend said.""However, the accurate number still does the job. A tenth of 1 percent is still a minuscule percentage of Americans contributing over $200 in an election cycle."" Bob Biersack, a veteran of the Federal Elections Commission and a senior fellow at the Center for Responsive Politics, agreed. The percentage is ""still a pretty small number,"" Biersack said. The data support McGhee’s broader point about the role of big donors. In 2012, that very small percentage delivered about two-thirds of all the money that came from individual donors. Now, giving $200 doesn’t necessarily mean you are wealthy. You might be a person of moderate means who is very passionate. But the Sunlight Foundation, a group that presses for more campaign finance disclosure, cut the numbers another way. Looking at all federal donations, they found that almost 30 percent came from just about 31,000 people. That’s pretty much McGhee’s 1 percent of 1 percent. And the median donation in this group? Over $26,000, or more than half the median family income in the United States. These people were not of modest means. ""The wealthy have always had big impact,"" Biersack said. ""The recent changes have simply reinforced and extended their advantage."" The big donors shade strongly Republican. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, among those giving $10,000 or more, 39 percent of the money went to Democrats and 55 percent went to Republicans. Our ruling McGhee said, ""Less than 1 percent of 1 percent of the American population has given an amount over $200."" McGhee way overshoots the mark. At that donation level, the more accurate statistic is a tenth of 1 percent. McGhee’s staff acknowledge the error. The data do support her bigger point that big donors dominate the campaign system. But McGhee used very precise numbers for rhetorical effect. And she got those numbers wrong by at least a factor of 10.

David Alameel has been $5 million bipartisan donor, but last gave to Republicans in 2008
","Kesha Rogers of Houston described her foe in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the state's Democratic U.S. Senate nomination as a current donor to Republicans including that party’s nominee, second-term Sen. John Cornyn. Rogers, a LaRouche Democrat making her first bid for statewide office, made her comment about Dallas investor David Alameel in our March 27 interview with her during our check of a claim that she’s not a Democrat. Rogers is a Democrat, we concluded, though she espouses views out of step with mainstream Democrats such as a desire to impeach President Barack Obama. In that interview, we asked if Rogers had more to share on her Democratic bonafides. ""We should look at the fact that my opponent… Mr. Alameel... is giving thousands of dollars to support the... Republican Party candidates such as... John Cornyn and John Abbott himself,"" Rogers replied, shortly agreeing that she meant Greg Abbott, the state attorney general and 2014 Republican gubernatorial nominee. Alameel’s donations to numerous candidates over the years have been noted. But has he backed Republicans of late? News coverage In a news story posted online Dec. 2, 2013, the Dallas Morning News said Alameel and his wife donated $8,000 to Cornyn’s campaign and $7,500 to Cornyn’s political action committee in 2004 and 2005. The story also said Alameel gave Abbott $165,000 from 2002 to 2008 while Alameel gave $30,000 in 2012 to state Sen. Wendy Davis, the Fort Worth Democrat then on her way to becoming the Democrats’ 2014 choice for governor. Broadly, the story said, Alameel had pitched in for candidates from both major parties. ""He’s given $700,000 in the last six years to Democrats at the federal level,"" the newspaper said, while donating $250,000 to Republican Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst from 2002 to 2008 and earlier giving $75,000 to Rick Perry’s campaign in 1998, when Perry, now governor, was bidding for lieutenant governor. ""I’m not your typical Democrat,"" Alameel was quoted as saying. ""I’m conservative in many ways and have worked with both parties."" About a month later, the weekly Austin Chronicle said in a news story that another Democratic Senate candidate, Maxey Scherr of El Paso, had described Alameel as a DINO--Democrat In Name Only. According to the Chronicle, Scherr singled out past Alameel donations to Dewhurst as well as $4,200 given to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and $8,400 donated to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. The story further noted the donations to Cornyn and said Alameel gave $50,000 in 2005-06 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Then again, the story said, Alameel stopped giving to Republicans after the 2008 elections. ""Since then, Alameel's donations have been strictly Demo­cratic and progressive,"" the story said. ""His campaign notes that he is the nation's 15th biggest Democratic donor. That includes $100,000 to the progressive Lone Star Pro­ject PAC, and almost $2 million to his North Texas Leader­ship PAC."" Federal Election Commission breakdown We asked the Federal Election Commission to itemize Alameel’s donations to candidates and political committees. By email, spokesman Christian Hilland sent charts showing Alameel and his wife ponied up about $1 million to nearly 60 recipients from 1989 into May 2013, counting his largest contribution of $500,000, in 2012, to Majority PAC, a super PAC created by a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid with a focus on protecting the Democrats’ Senate majority. That year, Alameel sought a Dallas-Fort Worth U.S. House seat, losing the Democratic primary to a Fort Worth state representative, Marc Veasey. Cornyn fielded $8,000 from Alameel in November 2004, according to the chart. In a Jan. 30, 2014, news blog post, the Morning News noted that Alameel had recently said he wanted that money back with Cornyn shooting back that a refund wasn’t going to happen. Outside of the six-figure donation to Majority PAC, Alameel’s federal donations went more to Republicans than Democrats: He and his wife donated nearly $270,000 to about 17 Republican candidates or committees and about $180,000 to about 15 Democratic beneficiaries. See the main chart provided by Hilland here and one covering other Alameel donations here. Alameel’s latest donation to a Republican seeking federal office amounted to $28,500 supportive of Sen. John McCain, dated April 23, 2008, according to the FEC information, while after that, Alameel donated nearly $660,000 to Democratic candidates and committees. Texas Ethics Commission records To get a fix on how much Alameel has given to candidates for state office, we searched state campaign finance reports stockpiled on the Texas Ethics Commission website. From February 2000 into January 2014, this search indicated, Alameel donated about $4 million to such candidates and committees including Democrats, Republicans and Carole Keeton, then Carole Keeton Strayhorn, who declared herself an Independent before running for governor in 2006. Alameel’s biggest state beneficiary was his since-disbanded PAC, which drew in some $2.8 million, according to the search. Per Rogers’ claim: Alameel made five donations to Abbott, adding up to $165,000, from December 2002 through June 2007, the search shows, though Alameel earlier in 2002 gave $30,000 to Democrat Kirk Watson when Watson faced Abbott for attorney general. Alameel’s latest donation to a Republican aspirant for state office was $10,000, given March 3, 2008, to Texans for Cole, the committee for Jonathan Cole, a Collin County candidate, our search showed. More recently, Alameel and Alameel Family Partners, Ltd., gave $307,500 from January 2013 through January 2014 to Democratic interests. This included $250,000 that went to the state kitty of the Lone Star Project, a pro-Democratic group managed by Matt Angle out of the Washington, D.C. area, and $50,000 given to the Democratic caucus in the Texas House, according to the search. A Rogers’ campaign adviser, Harley Schlanger, said by email that Rogers obviously meant Alameel had donated funds to Republicans in the past. ""If she said in her discussion with you he ‘is giving,’ she misspoke,"" Schlanger said. He said earlier: ""Her point is that the people attacking her for her opposition to Obama are embracing a candidate who has a clear and defined past relationship with the Republican Party."" We were unable to reach Alameel or anyone with Alameel’s campaign. Our ruling Rogers said Alameel ""is giving thousands of dollars to support the Republican Party candidates"" such as Cornyn and Abbott.

Charlie Crist signed 'an automatic 15 percent annual tuition increase,' Rick Scott's campaign says
","As the gubernatorial campaign season gears up, Gov. Rick Scott and Charlie Crist are trading shots over their records on education spending, with each accusing the other of making bad decisions. One such series of volleys has been over college tuition. ""While Gov. Scott is fighting to keep college tuition low and has challenged all state colleges to offer $10,000 degrees to make college more affordable for Florida families, Charlie Crist signed into law an automatic 15 percent annual tuition increase that put college further out of reach for many Floridians,"" a campaign email to the media said on March 26, 2014. It preceded a Scott visit to Jefferson High School in Tampa, where Scott met with students to discuss college costs. We wanted to see whether Crist approved automatic 15 percent tuition increases. High cost of learning Back in 2009, Sen. Ken Pruitt, R-Fort Pierce, sponsored a bill to increase tuition at all 11 state universities by up to 15 percent a year, an idea Crist supported. It was an extension of a plan approved by the Legislature in 2007 that allowed the largest state research universities to charge an annual increase up to 15 percent. (Prior that, the Legislature set undergraduate tutition with no cap, while the Board of Governors set graduate and out-of-state rates, not to exceed 15 percent over the previous year.) The plan, known as tuition differential, allows universities to raise undergraduate tuition beyond any legislative base tuition hike as long as the total increase does not exceed 15 percent each year. The universities may keep raising tuition until reaching the national average, which for 2012-13 was $8,893. The Legislature approved the measure during the 2009 session. Crist signed both the budget and the differential law, which went into effect that year. Prior to the announcement, Crist had been an opponent of hiking tuition, vetoing a 5 percent tuition increase in 2007 and opposing a plan for higher rates at some universities. The argument for the increase was that Florida universities needed to raise tuition in order to pay for need-based scholarships, keep top professors and be competitive with other states -- Florida public universities were 45th in tuition costs in 2011 (the state was 43rd last year, according to the College Board). Some university officials have since complained that decreased post-secondary education funding from the Legislature has necessitated the need for massive tuition increases. There are a couple of inaccuracies in the way Scott’s campaign worded its claim. First, the increase is not automatic. The Legislature sets base tuition each year. If the state budget doesn’t provide a base increase, tuition goes up at the rate of inflation. Individual universities then may ask the Florida Board of Governors for another increase, known as the tuition differential. The base increase by the Legislature and the differential, if approved by the board, can total no more than 15 percent. It can be less, and has been several times since the 2009 law was passed. The final increase takes effect in the fall term of the year it is approved. Lawmakers approved an 8 percent increase in 2009. The Board of Governors followed with a 7 percent differential increase, bringing the total to 15 percent. The Legislature and the board repeated the numbers in 2010 and 2011 -- 8 percent from Tallahassee, 7 percent from the board. But in 2012, the Legislature did not set a base tuition increase. Instead of asking for the maximum allowable amount from the board, universities asked for a wide range of differential hikes. This was done in part to protest the continued cuts in state funding to universities. The following year, Scott vetoed a 3 percent increase from the Legislature, and the Board of Governors voted to prevent universities to even raise fees, though students supported some of the hikes. Tuition statewide increased by an inflation-based 1.7 percent, which Scott had opposed. The governor appoints the Board of Governors and is allowed to voice his opinion in regards to the potential increase. When we contacted Scott’s campaign, spokesman Greg Blair took responsibility for the remark, and admitted it was not worded correctly. ""It’s not automatic in the sense that it happens year over year no matter what,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. ""However, it did take the increase out of the hands of the Legislature and the governor and allowed every school in Florida to raise tuition by 15 percent."" Our ruling Scott’s campaign said in an email to reporters, ""Charlie Crist signed into law an automatic 15 percent annual tuition increase."" It’s true that Crist did sign a law allowing tuition increases, but they were neither automatic nor always 15 percent. The legislation allowed the Board of Governors to supplement whatever increase lawmakers provided in the state budget by increasing tuition up to a total of 15 percent. While the tuition differential was used to its fullest extent for several years, a Board of Governors vote was required each year. The governor has no say over what the board decides, but does pick the members. The amount by which the board has voted to change tuition has varied the past two years. The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E8D3B40>],/factchecks/2014/apr/03/rick-scott/charlie-crist-signed-automatic-15-percent-annual-t/

Republican Governors Association says under Mary Burke 40 percent of jobs promised by Commerce Department under didn’t materialize
","Major problems at his redesigned job-creation agency created a political headache for Gov. Scott Walker when millions of dollars in taxpayer money given to businesses was not tracked. Now Walker’s allies in his 2014 re-election campaign are hoping to spread the pain to Democratic challenger Mary Burke. Burke, as Commerce secretary under Walker predecessor Jim Doyle, ran the predecessor agency to Walker’s Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. Now Burke’s record at the Commerce Department is under attack in a series of TV ads from the Republican Governors Association. The most recent came after a Burke ad claimed that ""under Walker, unemployment’s up."" We rated that Pants on Fire, noting unemployment has gone steadily down since Walker took office. ""Burke is desperate to hide her failed record on jobs,"" the ad begins. The spot cites a 2007 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation into Commerce Department subsidies given to businesses that promised to create jobs. An announcer says: ""What is clear is in Madison, Burke wasted millions of tax dollars, and promised jobs didn’t materialize."" Two quotes attributed to the newspaper are featured on-screen, including ""Major shortcomings"" and ""40% of jobs … failed to materialize."" We’re not going to fact check whether millions was ""wasted"" in the subsidy programs. There’s considerable disagreement on whether such programs work or are necessary, even when promised jobs get created. So in some respects that is a matter of opinion. But we decided to take a look at how the RGA was characterizing the Journal Sentinel’s work and Burke’s role in the problems it noted. About the program Subsidy programs for corporations have proliferated since Wisconsin began providing grants, tax credits and forgivable loans in the 1980s to keep businesses from fleeing the state, the Journal Sentinel reported in that 2007 series. The taxpayer-provided aid, about $50 million a year as of 2007, generally comes with some strings: creating or preserving jobs, or helping low-income areas, the stories said. Now, back to the RGA’s TV spot. The Journal Sentinel series, ""Subsidies Without Scrutiny,"" found 40% of jobs promised by 25 firms that won $80 million in state aid over a six-year period ""failed to materialize,"" a Journal Sentinel follow-up story noted on July 5, 2007. The RGA ad cites this follow-up story specifically. The group of 25 firms included the 10 largest aid recipients, accounting for roughly one-fourth of all business subsidies given. The series also found what were termed ""major shortcomings"" in state subsidy records. Firms receiving help rarely complied with their aid agreements, state officials routinely eased rules for business recipients and no reliable process existed to track success or failure, it found. Many of the state subsidy files examined by the Journal Sentinel were in disarray, the series found. Companies were supposed to file with the agency annual or semiannual progress reports on job creation. But many of the reports were late or missing. That hobbled the Commerce Department's ability to tally how successful its aid programs had been, the paper found. (It’s worth noting, in addition, that that the stories took a snapshot of the job creation as of 2007, but additional jobs may have been created or lost since then at the firms receiving aid. The 40 percent figure has not been updated). In short, the RGA’s claim accurately, if ever so briefly, summarizes the problems in the business-aid programs identified by the newspaper. How much responsibility? A trickier question is what was Burke’s role in this. The newspaper examined information on subsidies dating from January 2000 to March 2006. Doyle tapped Burke in February 2005 to run Commerce and she left in November 2007. So how much responsibility does she bear? There’s no doubt Burke was in charge when some of the incentives examined by the newspaper were initially granted. It’s also clear that many of the 25 firms won approval for state help before Burke was on the scene -- 70 percent, we found in looking back at the reporting of the 2007 Journal Sentinel series. Many of the deals originated earlier under Doyle or even before that under Republican Governors Tommy Thompson and Scott McCallum. Still, even on many of those older subsidy arrangements, Burke would have been responsible for monitoring the promised jobs and handing out the money. That’s because the money was portioned out as jobs were created, often over up to a seven-year period. In the 2007 Journal Sentinel series, Burke took responsibility for some problems, defended the program in general and pointed out specific successes. She blamed tight budgets for record-keeping she acknowledged had shortcomings. She argued that the incentives are necessary in some cases just to preserve jobs at a company weighing lucrative offers from other states. ""They need to see a sign ... that we value their presence,"" Burke said in 2007. Burke said at the time that improvements were underway in tracking firms’ progress on jobs goals. She also noted at the time that one safeguard in place was that companies can’t claim tax credits unless they meet job goals. The newspaper, however, found companies often got tax credits for preserving old jobs as well as for creating new ones and that companies routinely got more time to meet job goals than contracts specified. The paper’s findings mirrored those of an earlier legislative audit that examined various state economic development programs in a narrower period than the newspaper’s review. The state audit looked at mid-2003 to mid-2005. That period overlaps Burke’s tenure, but by just six months. The 2006 audit found: • Insurance companies claimed more than $29 million in tax credits over six years under a program that created just 316 jobs. For each job created, taxpayers spent $91,871 — far more than what they spent to create jobs in other programs. The audit found a wide range in the cost of creating or retaining jobs under other programs, from a low of $556 to a high of $22,727 per job. • At least two companies laid off employees within three years of receiving state grants. The state does little long-term follow-up with grant recipients and so is unaware of other such examples, auditors said. • The state Department of Commerce did not adequately follow up on the performance of companies that received assistance. Its regular reports to the Legislature detailed expected outcomes, rather than results. In response to the audit, Burke, whose job was to oversee many of the state’s economic development programs, said in 2006 that the audit made welcome recommendations on improving reporting and streamlining the programs. But she said the state was doing a good job in getting money to the right businesses. Doyle, in the wake of the audit, acknowledged that targeting money to the right areas can be difficult. ""What you really have to do is make sure that the grants that are going out are going to companies that have good plans. . . . (But) you can never predict exactly what the future is,"" he said. ""You’ve got to have smart people who are really looking at whether the applications are ones that show real promise."" Our rating The Republican Governors Association said that under Burke, Commerce Department business-incentive programs had ""major shortcomings"" and ""40 percent of jobs … didn’t materialize."" The programs did have significant problems, some acknowledged by Burke at the time. And the 40 percent figure is accurately drawn from the Journal Sentinel series that sampled the job-creation progress for 25 companies. But the ad’s claim needs clarification in that the newspaper series focused mainly on deals that originated before Burke took office, though she was responsible for overseeing the disbursal of money. That fact puts some of the blame on Burke’s predecessors. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54EBF80C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/03/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-says-40-percent-j/

Climate change musical funded by $700,000 National Science Foundation grant
","Republican U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, whose district stretches from San Antonio north into Austin, recently pressed an official about the government bankrolling a musical. Smith, chairman of the House Science, Space & Technology Committee, listed six National Science Foundation grants as questionable--including, Smith said at the panel’s March 26, 2014, hearing, a ""climate change musical that was prepared for Broadway but I’m not sure ever was actually produced, $700,000."" Smith then asked John Holdren, the White House science czar, if the foundation should justify such grants to the public, whose tax dollars fund them, the Texan reminded. Holdren replied that the foundation, which is entrusted with promoting scientific progress, already justifies its grants in online posts. ""We’re going to have to agree to disagree,"" Smith said. We’ve noted the scientific consensus globally that the Earth is warming. We focused for this article on whether the foundation ponied up for a play about that. Grant confirmed To our inquiry, a foundation spokeswoman, Dana Topousis, said by email the grant was awarded in 2010, adding: ""The Civilians, Inc., a Brooklyn, N.Y., theatre company, developed an innovative, out-of-the-box approach to exposing U.S. citizens to science. The project represents the unique cultural leverage of theater in its attempt to inspire the public’s imagination and curiosity about basic science and its relation to their everyday lives."" Topousis continued: ""This venture, like other more traditional NSF-funded informal science education projects (e.g., interactive science exhibits, IMAX films, science-based television programming), aims to educate through a focus on understanding the scientific method, its applications, and its unique ability to extract knowledge about our complex natural world. It presents the pursuit of fundamental knowledge through basic research in a neutral manner that does not advocate any position regarding climate change or conservation research,"" she said. A foundation summary of the grant award, brought to our attention by Topousis and Zach Kurz, staff spokesman for the Republican side of Smith’s committee, states that a grant totaling $697,177 was awarded in 2010 covering August 2010 through July 2014. Play description The summary describes ""The Great Immensity"" as a ""touring play with songs and video that explores our relationship to the environment, with a focus on critical issues of climate change and biodiversity conservation."" ""The play has been created with a network of partners including the Princeton Environmental Institute and Princeton Atelier Program/Lewis Arts Center, which will maintain an ongoing relationship with the project,"" the summary says, continuing: ""The play uses real places and stories drawn from interviews conducted by the artists to create an experience that is part investigative journalism and part inventive theater. Attendance at the performances is projected to be about 75,000."" The summary also says: ""A major goal of the project is to help the public better appreciate how science studies the Earth's biosphere and to promote an inquisitive curiosity about our place in the natural world. The initiative also intends to create and evaluate a new model for how theater can increase public awareness, knowledge, and engagement with important science-related societal issues."" Also, the summary says, the project will lead to the ""development and testing of online content, podcasts, and videos as well as special community education and outreach efforts in each community where the play is staged. Performances will be accompanied by post-performance panel discussions with the artists, local scientists and policy makers. After the completion of the initial tour, the play will be published, licensed, and made available to other theaters to produce independently."" Tickets on sale By phone, Sarah Benvenuti, an administrator for the Civilian Theater Co., said the play is slated to run April 11-May 1, 2014, at the Public Theater’s Martinson Hall in New York, which is not on Broadway. Tickets will be $20 each, she said. Benvenuti said the play is about climate change and includes musical numbers, which one can view in online videos. ""Margin of Error,"" for instance, shows cast members singing about poll results. (Really.) We wondered if the presentation is explicit, say, about human contributions to warming. Benevenuti didn’t say, though she stressed that the play draws on direct conversations with expert scientists. ""Climate change is a real thing,"" she said. ""We have to do something about it."" The script is not published, she said, but she pointed out the Public Theater’s online description of the play as a ""continent-hopping thriller following a woman, Phyllis, as she pursues her husband Karl who disappeared from a tropical island while on an assignment for a nature show. Through her search,"" the summary says, ""Phyllis uncovers a mysterious plot surrounding the upcoming international climate summit in Paris. As the days count down to the summit, Phyllis must decipher the plan and possibly stop it in time. With arresting projected film and video and a wide-ranging score of songs,"" the play ""is a highly theatrical look into one of the most vital questions of our time: how can we change ourselves and our society in time to solve the enormous environmental challenges that confront us?"" Finally, we circled back to the foundation to ask if the musical was an unusual grant beneficiary. Topousis replied by email that while the NSF ""research portfolio this falls under--Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL)--contains projects at the intersection of science and the arts, NSF’s funding this kind of project--a theatrical production--is rare."" Our ruling Smith said the science foundation awarded $700,000 for a climate change musical. The NSF awarded nearly that much for a theater company to produce a musical play that focuses on climate change and biodiversity conservation.

Cokie Roberts: Two-thirds of minimum-wage earners are women
","Many Democrats are eager to debate raising the federal minimum wage because it’s a popular issue to the party base, especially women, says ABC News political commentator Cokie Roberts. ""When you're talking about the minimum wage, you're talking about women,"" Roberts said March 31 on NPR’s Morning Edition. ""Two-thirds of the people who receive the minimum wage are female, and this is one of many attempts on the part of Democrats to get out the voters who normally don't vote in an off-year election, to try to get them to the polls this year. We’ll see whether that works or not."" Is her statistic accurate? The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, a hub for data on American workers and the unemployed, had just the report, ""Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers, 2013."" The BLS collects this data through a national monthly survey of households called the Current Population Survey. It does not account for overtime pay, tips or commissions workers earn above their hourly wage. Of the 75.9 million Americans who earn hourly wages (and make up half of the nation’s workforce), 1.5 million earn exactly the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, and 1.8 million earn less than that, according to BLS. Here, we’re focused on the gender composition of those 3.3 million workers who earn at or below the minimum wage. We found it’s true that women have a disproportionately high place in the minimum-wage workforce than men. In 2013, 62.4 percent of workers, or 2.06 million people, who earned at or below the federal minimum wage were women. This was down slightly from the year before, when it was 64 percent. It’s important to know this data only isolates workers who make the federal minimum wage of $7.25 or below. Many states have set a higher minimum wage for their residents. The BLS measure would not account for minimum-wage earners in California, who earn $8 an hour, or their counterparts in Washington, who earn the highest minimum pay in the country of $9.32. A recent Congressional Budget Office report pointed out half of all workers live in states where the minimum wage is more than $7.25 an hour. Still, these caveats do not undermine Roberts’ point, said Heidi Shierholz, a labor economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, which supports increasing the minimum wage. An increased federal minimum wage to $10.10 would set a new floor for all workers in the country, even those in states that set their own minimum wages. And it wouldn’t just lift the pay of workers who earn $7.25 an hour, but also those who make slightly more, such as $8 or $9 an hour. A study by the Economic Policy Institute found women would make up 55 percent percent of workers who would benefit from raising the minimum wage to $10.10 by the second half of 2016, a congressional proposal backed by the White House. That figure aligns with CBO data, too. ""If you raise the wage floor, more women will be affected by that,"" Shierholz said. ""That’s the bottom line."" The discrepancy in pay between men and women known as the ""gender gap"" is closer at the bottom of the income distribution than at the top 1 percent of earners, Shierholz said. The gap is closing as a result of more women going to college and stagnated male wages. The White House argues raising the minimum wage would further tighten the gap because women are overrepresented in low-paying professions. The amount of women in tips-based jobs, such as hairstylists and waitresses, is even higher than the female share of the federal minimum wage workforce, Shierholz said. Employers are allowed to pay workers a minimum of $2.13 an hour as long as their tips or at least $5.12, or the difference between $2.13 and $7.25. The White House also wants an increase in the tipped minimum wage of $2.13 an hour to $4.90 by 2016 under the proposed Harkin-Miller legislation. Efforts to reach Roberts through ABC News were unsuccessful. Our ruling Roberts said, ""Two-thirds of the people who receive the minimum wage are female."" The actual figure is just a little bit lower. Federal data shows 62 percent of people who earn the federal minimum wage or below are women. The federal data has limitations, as it does not account for women in states with a higher minimum wage. One study says that if the federal government raises the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, women will benefit more than men by a 55-45 percent spread. Roberts claim is on the right track but needs some additional information.

Rick Scott touts (private-sector) job growth
","Ask Gov. Rick Scott about practically any topic and he is bound to steer the conversation back to jobs. The former CEO of a health care company loves to cite statistics that relate to job growth, such as this one in a March 31 online ad: ""Florida’s economy is on a better path. Since December 2010 Florida has created 540,000 new jobs. Let’s keep working."" Scott, who has governed during the national recovery, is expected to face former Gov. Charlie Crist, who governed during the recession, in November. The jobs picture under both governors is a key topic of debate in the race. Did Scott correctly cite the number of new jobs in Florida? Private vs. public-sector jobs Scott started the clock ticking in December 2010, one month before the Republican took office. His campaign used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to arrive at the figure. BLS data shows that the number of total nonfarm jobs grew by 517,500 between December 2010 and preliminary data for February 2014, the most recent month available. That’s a little short of the number Scott used. Scott gets to his number by ignoring reductions in government jobs. During the same time frame, Florida lost 23,200 government jobs. So if it hadn’t been for the lost government jobs, the number would be 540,000. At PolitiFact Florida we are very familiar with Scott’s statements about jobs and have been tracking his 2010 campaign promise to create over 700,000 jobs in seven years. That promise is currently rated In the Works. When Scott debuted his jobs promise in July 2010, state economists had released estimates showing that Florida would add 1.05 million jobs between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2018 -- no matter who served as governor. In response, Scott clarified his promise and said that his 700,000 jobs would come in addition to the ones state economists forecasted. Put simpler: his 7-7-7 plan became 7-7-1.7 million. Scott’s press office has consistently disagreed with our analysis, saying Scott’s campaign materials never qualified that 700,000 jobs would be on top of normal growth projections. To achieve the goal of 700,000 jobs on top of normal growth requires the state to produce more than 20,000 jobs on average per month, every month, for seven years. He has fallen short of that average the majority of the months, though the jobs picture improved in 2013. In this particular online ad, Scott doesn’t use words to take credit for the job growth, but he is touting job growth during his watch. We have interviewed economists in the past who caution that a governor can’t take much credit for job growth during a national recovery -- or too much blame for job losses during a national recession. Kwame Donaldson, an economist at Moody’s who analyzes Florida, said that the creation of 540,000 private-sector jobs in the 38 months since December 2010 is not a particularly exceptional rate of job creation. ""The most private-sector jobs created during any 38-month interval is 753,100 (during the 38-month interval that ended in August 2006),"" Donaldson said in an email to PolitiFact Florida. ""The current record is even less remarkable considering Florida’s larger current population."" Our ruling Scott said in an online ad, ""Since December 2010 Florida has created 540,000 new jobs."" Looking only at the numbers -- and not whether Scott’s policies should get credit for the growth -- Florida added 517,500 total nonfarm jobs and lost 23,000 government-sector jobs between December 2010 and February 2014. It would have been more accurate for Scott to cite private-sector job growth.

Harry Reid says Koch brothers are richest family in the world
","For weeks, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has been using floor speeches to target Charles and David Koch, the industrialist brothers with libertarian political views who have spent generously -- and gotten others to spend generously -- to support conservative candidates and issues. In an April 2, 2014, floor speech, Reid criticized a House budget proposal drawn up by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., saying it reflected the principles of the Koch brothers and would lower taxes on the wealthy. ""Is $80 billion of personal wealth for the Koch brothers enough?"" Reid asked. ""I think most everyone would say yes, it's enough. But not the Koch brothers. They want more. They're the richest people in the world. Individually they're only fifth. Put them together they're the richest in the world."" We wondered: Is that correct? Reid’s office didn’t respond to an inquiry for this story, but we were able to find some answers. It’s tricky to say definitively who is richer than who, because of privacy issues and fluctuations in market values. But the longstanding yardstick for measuring the world’s richest people comes from Forbes magazine, which publishes both the Forbes 400 (a list of the 400 richest Americans) and the World’s Billionaires (which tracks more than 1,600 billionaires across the globe). Currently, Charles and David Koch, when measured as individuals, are tied for sixth place on the international list, with $40.7 billion each. Combined, their net worth is $81.4 billion, which is higher than the highest-ranking individual on the list -- Microsoft founder Bill Gates, at $77.8 billion. (A third brother, William, has long been estranged from Charles and David, and media accounts about the brothers’ giving patterns generally do not consider him to be part of the ""Koch brothers."" William is worth an additional $4 billion.) So are Charles and David Koch No. 1 in the world? They’re close--but not quite. Reid ignored one other family that, collectively, has greater net worth than the Kochs: the Waltons, the heirs to the Walmart fortune. Here’s the rundown, in descending order of their ranking on the Forbes international list: 9. Christy Walton and family: $38 billion 10. Jim Walton: $35.6 billion 11. Alice Walton: $35.1 billion 12. S. Robson Walton: $35.1 billion 305. Ann Walton Kroenke: $5.0 billion 367. Nancy Walton Laurie: $4.2 billion Together, the six Waltons have a net worth of $153 billion -- a little less than double the holdings of Charles and David Koch. So if Reid is going to put together the Koch brothers, it makes sense to combine the wealth of the Walton family as well. And the Walton family’s wealth is bigger. Our ruling Reid said the Koch brothers are ""the richest people in the world. Individually they're only fifth. Put them together they're the richest in the world."" If you look at families -- which is what Reid is essentially doing -- then Charles and David Koch rank second internationally to six members of the Walton family, at least according to Forbes. That’s still pretty close to the top of the list.

Leaving aside Limbaugh’s reference to a couple of recalls (Walker prevailed in the one recall attempt, in 2012, made against him), many Wisconsinites likely regard their state as being roughly as much red (Republican) as it is blue (Democratic). And they, along with Limbaugh’s millions of other listeners, might be surprised that unemployment has gotten so low. Blue, red and purple The Washington Post traces the widespread use of red and blue to the late ""Meet the Press"" host Tim Russert and an appearance he made on ""The Today Show"" about a week before George W. Bush’s victory over Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election. Russert and host Matt Lauer discussed a map that had a red-and-blue color scheme. Up to then, there had been no consensus and some media identified Democratic states as red and Republican states as blue. How states vote for president, in the most recent election or the last several presidential contests, has become a common way to identify states as blue or red. Viewed narrowly, Wisconsin is blue, having voted for the Democratic nominee in each of the last seven presidential contests. Over the past five decades, only two Republicans, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, have won Wisconsin. (Nixon won in 1960, 1968 and 1972, and Reagan won in 1980 and 1984). Limbaugh spokeswoman Rachel Nelson said Limbaugh based the blue-state part of his claim on the fact that Wisconsin hadn’t voted for the GOP presidential nominee since ‘84. But calling Wisconsin ""one of the bluest"" states suggests it’s an automatic in the Democratic column, when in fact it has often been a presidential battleground. Four months before the 2012 election, for example, Politico listed Wisconsin as one of nine swing states; days before the vote, the New York Times listed Wisconsin as one of just six swing states.   And on other measures, Wisconsin isn’t clearly blue at all. In terms of control of state government, Wisconsin’s hue is red, with Walker as governor and the GOP in control of both houses of the Legislature. Accordingly, The Post in December 2013 colored Wisconsin red in observing how states are aligning completely with one party -- three-quarters of them are now controlled by either Republicans or Democrats. It’s worth nothing, however, that things can change quickly in Wisconsin. Just prior to the 2010 elections, which put Walker and his fellow Republicans in power, Wisconsin state government was blue, with a Democrat as governor (Jim Doyle didn’t seek re-election) and Democrats controlling the Legislature. Meanwhile, Wisconsin looks purple -- as in a mix of blue and red --  when it comes to federal representatives and party preferences. In the U.S. Senate, conservative Republican Ron Johnson and liberal Democrat Tammy Baldwin are about as far apart politically as any state's senators. Wisconsin’s House delegation is closely split, with five Republicans and three Democrats. As for party preferences, a yearlong annual Gallup poll released in January 2014 identified 17 states as blue, meaning their residents were solidly or leaning Democratic; and 14 as red, as in solidly or leaning Republican. That left 19 states, including Wisconsin, rated as competitive. In sum, Wisconsin doesn’t measure up as one the bluest states. Unemployment down, but not that low On the 3.5 percent unemployment part of his claim, Limbaugh misspoke, his spokeswoman said. She noted Limbaugh had also referenced the Dakotas during that part of his show. (In January 2014, the latest rates available when Limbaugh made his statement, the unemployment rate was 3.6 percent in South Dakota and 2.6 percent in North Dakota.)    Two weeks before Limbaugh made his statement, we evaluated a claim by Democrat Mary Burke, Walker's challenger in the November 2014 gubernatorial election. We gave her a Pants on Fire for claiming that unemployment under Walker is up. Although Walker is not on pace to meet his campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs by January 2015, unemployment has dropped from 7.7 percent when he took office in January 2011 to near 6 percent. It was 6.1 percent in January 2014. Wisconsin’s unemployment rate last hit 3.5 percent in November 2000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our rating Limbaugh said Wisconsin is ""one of the bluest"" states, but under Walker its unemployment rate ""is around 3.5%."" Although Wisconsin has voted for the Democratic nominee in the last seven presidential contests, as a frequent battleground state, it is far from being an automatic in the Democratic column. At the state level, meanwhile, Wisconsin is currently Republican red but was recently Democratic blue, and by other measures it is somewhere between the two. As for unemployment under Walker, it has dropped to near 6 percent, but nowhere near 3.5 percent. We rate Limbaugh’s statement False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DAD9440>],/factchecks/2014/apr/02/rush-limbaugh/wisconsin-heavily-democratic-state-and-yet-under-s/

Grad rates rise in Austin
","Education trends come and go. But calls for better high school graduation rates have only intensified as technology demands a higher-skilled workforce.  Results on that front were a top achievement noted by Atlanta school board members last week as they announced that Meria Carstarphen, the superintendent of the Austin Independent School District, is their choice to succeed Erroll B. Davis Jr. as Atlanta Public Schools superintendent.  The school district in Texas’ capital city announced in July that the graduation rate for its Class of 2012 had hit an all-time record of 82.5 percent. That’s a great rate by most standards and well above Georgia’s 69.73 percent grad rate and APS’ rate of 50.87 percent that year.  But is it accurate? And is it something Carstarphen deserves credit for? We thought we’d look deeper into the numbers.  Carstarphen, 44, took the helm of the Austin district -- with 87,000 students, 12,000 employees and a $950 million annual budget -- in July 2009. At that time, the district’s high school graduation rate was 74.3 percent, based on data for the Class of 2008. Austin’s grad rate has climbed steadily since then. It was 75.6 in 2009, 78.6 percent in 2010 and 80 percent in 2011, before reaching 82.5 in 2012, according to data from the Texas Education Agency. During Carstarphen’s tenure, the graduation rate improved most among Austin’s African-American students, going from 71.5 percent for the Class of 2010 to 79.6 percent for the Class of 2012, for a difference of 8.1 percentage points. In that period, the rate improved for all students by 3.9 percentage points, by 5.7 percentage points for Hispanic students and by a tiny 0.1 percentage points for white students, according to district data. But Austin still has the lowest graduation rate among the state’s large urban districts for economically disadvantaged students, at 78.9 percent. The upward trajectory of Austin’s overall graduation rate mirrors that of the state. Texas, in fact, has one of the nation’s highest high school graduation rates. Its graduation rate climbed almost 10 percentage points in six years to  87.7 percent for 2012. Only one state -- Iowa -- had a better record that year for on-time graduations, with 89 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Nationwide, the average grad rate was 81 percent in 2012. Getting an accurate gauge of the high school graduation rate seems like a simple task. But for years, some states and local school districts were allowed to calculate their rates by more than one method. As a result, any national figure was, at best, a rough estimate, and state-by-state comparisons were difficult and discouraged.  But beginning in 2011, the federal government mandated that all states and school districts calculate their graduation rates by counting the number of students who completed high school four years after starting ninth grade. That meant states such as Georgia could no longer count students who took five, six or more years to complete high school. They also could no longer write off students who left school as transfers, potentially masking the magnitude of their dropout problems. As a result, Georgia’s rate was recalculated downward more than 13 percentage points, from 80.9 percent to 67.5 percent in 2011. It’s risen since then, to 69.7 percent in 2012 and 71.5 percent in 2013. There also was some bounceback for APS, which saw its graduation rate jump to 58.6 percent in 2013. The rates in Texas and its local school districts weren’t affected by the federal policy change. The state has been reporting a four-year graduation rate for years, said Debbie Ratcliffe, a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency. Graduation rates factor into Texas’ school accountability ratings, and Austin closely tracks student attendance, Ratcliffe said. Parents in Austin get an automated message in the evening if their child was tardy or absent that day, she said. In some neighborhoods, teachers visit children at home if they drop out or are at risk of quitting school, Ratcliffe said. The Austin school district also has as its No. 2 person the state’s former ""dropout czar."" When they announced the 2012 grad rate last year, Austin school officials said they had implemented an early warning system to stop students headed for trouble. The system allows counselors and administrators to track student progress and step in when they see students falling behind, missing classes or facing other obstacles to long-term success, they said. Late last week, Carstarphen put out a release highlighting some of the district’s efforts to improve student outcomes in her tenure. They included the creation of alternative graduation pathways, including an after-hours chance at recovering lost credit hours at the district’s Twilight School. She said Austin was one of the first districts in the nation to incorporate social and emotional learning into its curriculum to help students manage their emotions, develop positive relationships and handle challenging situations constructively. The program was in 27 schools when it launched two years ago and will be in all schools at every grade level by 2015-2016, Carstarphen said. The Atlanta Board of Education is slated to formalize Carstarphen’s appointment April 14. Our conclusion Austin’s high school graduation rate has risen in Carstarphen’s tenure as school superintendent to 82.5 percent. It’s not as good as Texas’ overall graduation rate, but it is better than the national average and far better than the rates for Atlanta Public Schools and Georgia. It’s difficult to say how much of the increases can be attributed to policies she’s pushed. But it appears accurate. We rate the statement True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001A550644FC0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/02/meria-carstarphen/grad-rates-rise-austin/

Arian Foster: NCAA gets billions; players get trophies
","As the final four teams in the NCAA basketball championship get ready to play this weekend, the top question on the mind of virtually every sports fan is which schools will win. (At PunditFact, we like Florida.) But let the record show that at least one man has made up his own mind on the ultimate victor. Arian Foster, an NFL running back with the Houston Texans, was asked for his pick in the 68-team tournament. His tweeted reply? ""NCAA will win. They'll get billions, players get a trophy,"" Foster wrote. Ouch! At a moment when most people care about individual achievement and team cohesion, Foster is looking at the role of filthy lucre. We decided to see whether the facts back up his claim that the NCAA will get billions from the tournament, while the players will take home mere trophies. We tweeted to Foster and did not hear back. We also sent an email to the NCAA press office and got no reply. But there’s enough information on the public record to get some clarity. Ideally, we would have revenue numbers for this year, but we’ll have to make do with financials from 2013. From the NCAA’s home city of Indianapolis, the Indianapolis Star culled through the organization’s financial statements and reported that in 2013, the tournament brought in nearly $770 million, or about 84 percent of the organization’s total revenues. That’s big money but it isn’t billions. Furthermore, the NCAA shared most of that with the member colleges and universities. About $525 million passed from the NCAA to individual schools. These numbers are in line with NCAA financial reports we found for 2012 and 2011. Now, not all of the money that went to the schools ended up with the student-athletes. Regardless if they win during March Madness, they do get more than a trophy. The largest benefit comes in the form of athletic scholarship dollars. Known as grant-in-aid, student-athletes received the equivalent of $125 million in the 2012-13 season, according to the Indianapolis Star. This covers tuition, room and board and books for the players. The average grant across all sports and all divisions in the NCAA was over $13,000 for men and $14,000 for women. All of these disbursements from the NCAA cover all sports, not just basketball. A smaller fund, the Student Assistance Fund, is awarded on a case-by-case basis. The value last year was about $73 million. So in round figures, student-athletes got about $200 million out of the total revenues, or about a fourth of it. There is one other pot of money -- worth about $25 million -- that pays for tutors and other support to help the players keep up their grades. We didn’t include it because this is an indirect benefit. These scholarships might not be as generous as they would seem -- a fact that has led some to call for additional compensation for players. We came across studies that concluded that many athletes find that their scholarships don’t cover the full cost of their education. Some finish their time in school saddled with debt but with no diploma. Still, if Foster was talking about a single year, these numbers don’t back him up. While there are signs that revenues will be higher this year and could cross the $1 billion mark, it would require a doubling of revenues to get to billions (plural). That doesn’t seem likely. However, if we look at the next 10 years, the NCAA is completely in the multi-billion dollar zone. Its 2011-24 contract with CBS Sports and Turner Broadcasting is worth at least $10.8 billion. That is the largest single revenue stream and there are others. In this longer time frame, Foster is correct about the riches flowing to the NCAA. It is harder to know what would happen to the grants flowing to the players. Under the current NCAA by-laws, schools are not allowed to give students more than the actual costs of going to school. It is possible that revenues will rise faster than the cost of higher education. As a result, players will get a declining share of the proceeds. A pending lawsuit aims to overturn the NCAA limits on financial rewards to players. This raises issues of fairness but our fact-check deals only with whether the players get some monetary benefit and clearly, as a group, they receive substantial sums. Our ruling Foster said that the NCAA gets billions, while the winning players walk away with just a trophy. The revenues that come from the college basketball championship might be close to $1 billion, but there’s no sign that they have reached the $2 billion level. In addition, much of that money leaves the NCAA and goes to the schools. About a quarter of the total turns into scholarships for student-athletes. If Foster was talking about the NCAA’s lucrative multi-year contracts with broadcasters, his numbers are more accurate on the revenue side, but players still end up getting a lot more than a trophy. We don’t know what he had in mind. Overall, Foster’s point that the NCAA and colleges get a lot more out of the deal than the players is accurate. His specifics, however, are off. On balance, that comes to a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DAD41C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/01/arian-foster/arian-foster-ncaa-gets-billions-players-get-trophi/

Organizing for Action says Koch brothers group used booze to bribe young people out of buying health insurance
","""This is some sick crap."" So began an Organizing for Action fundraising email. The group attacked David and Charles Koch, the billionaire brothers who support the tea party movement. ""This should humiliate anyone who's ever been associated with the Koch brothers,"" the March 26 email continued. ""One of their anti-Obamacare groups is going to college campuses, giving away free booze to try to bribe young folks out of getting health insurance."" We wondered if such an education campaign, complete with free alcohol, really existed. The email referred to Generation Opportunity, a national political activist group made up of young conservatives. They’re behind the ""Creepy Uncle Sam"" ads you may have seen last year. Back in November 2013, the Tampa Bay Times reported on one of their 20 ""opt-out"" campaign stops at college campuses to educate students about alternatives to buying health insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. At a University of Miami-Virginia Tech football game tailgate, Generation Opportunity set up a DJ, beer pong tables, models and free pizza to draw students in. They handed out free gear with their logo on it -- T-shirts, beer koozies, bottle openers. The one thing they didn’t provide is the beer itself. Spokesman David Pasch said 21+college students brought their own beer to the Miami event and others. However, just off campus near several colleges, Generation Opportunity hosted happy hours where they did give out individual tickets for free drinks to 21+ attendees at places like The Crust, a Williamsburg, Va., pizza place. These events weren’t focused specifically on an anti-Affordable Care Act agenda, but there was free ""opt-out swag"" on hand, Pasch said. So we know Generation Opportunity did offer free booze to college-aged students at some of their events, but let’s take a closer look at the opt-out campaign. Organizing for Action claimed Generation Opportunity used the campaign to ""bribe young folks out of getting health insurance."" But Generation Opportunity’s events were open to everyone, Pasch said. Attendees at the tailgates and happy hours didn’t need to swear off the health care reform before snagging a free T-shirt or drink. Also, the campaign’s goal is not to encourage young Americans to go without health care. It’s to get them to look into alternative coverage options to the online marketplaces, such as private plans that still fit the Affordable Care Act’s 10 essential benefit requirements. Those plans still fulfill the law’s individual mandate, which requires everyone to have health insurance. ""We never have (and never will) advocate young people forgo health insurance,"" Pasch said. Our ruling Organizing for Action said Generation Opportunity is ""going to college campuses, giving away free booze to try to bribe young folks out of getting health insurance."" The Koch brothers-backed group holds Opt-Out events to encourage young people to consider buying health insurance off the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. At some of their education campaign events near college campuses, they did offer free alcohol to entice attendees. At campus events, students brought the booze themselves. Generation Opportunity didn’t bribe students, but they did offer alcohol to young people who wanted to hear about alternatives to the health care reform’s marketplaces. We rate Organizing for Action’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DAF8A40>],/factchecks/2014/apr/01/organizing-action/organizing-action-says-koch-brothers-group-used-bo/
