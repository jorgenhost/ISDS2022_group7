Donald Trump changes yardstick in claim about southern border apprehensions
","President Donald Trump says the country is continuing to make ""historic progress"" to curb the flow of illegal immigration along the southern border. ""We inherited a full-fledged border crisis. It was a disaster,"" Trump said in his weekly radio address April 7. ""Yet, with quick and bold steps, we have so far exceeded even the most bullish predictions for the progress we could make in so short a period of time. Last month, we saw a 64 percent reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border."" It wasn’t the first time Trump claimed he inherited a mess, or that he’s turned things around at the border. He’s recently emphasized statistics to show decreases in illegal immigration. In March, he said illegal immigration was down 61 percent since Election Day (Mostly True) and down 40 percent since his first month in office (Mostly True). Is Trump’s story getting even better? What we found is that Trump is changing how he's doing the counting in a way that emphasizes progress.  The ‘64 percent reduction’ To get to the 64 percent reduction, Trump isn’t looking at the decrease from February 2017 to March 2017, as he did when he talked about the decrease between January and February.  Instead, he’s looking at the year-over-year reduction (March 2016 vs. March 2017), the White House told us. U.S. Customs and Border Protection data show that in March 2017 border patrol made 12,193 apprehensions at the southwest border. In March 2016, there were 33,316 apprehensions. That’s a 63.4 percent decrease year-over-year. Add in people who were deemed inadmissable to the country and you reach 64 percent. But if you looked at the decrease from February 2017 to March 2017, as Trump did last month, the drop would not have been as dramatic. From February 2017 to March 2017, border patrol apprehensions dropped about 35 percent, not 64 percent. Point being, Trump picked the number that showed the biggest decrease, when last month he calculated the figure a different way. Importantly, a listener to Trump's weekly radio address would have no way of knowing Trump changed his measuring stick. Aside from the specific numbers, Trump’s rhetoric and tough immigration stance can be credited for the decreases, experts have told us. But they caution against making early conclusions about the effect Trump’s policies have had. Changes on the ground usually take longer to materialize, experts said. Oh, Canada? While data backs Trump’s claim of decreases at the U.S.-Mexico border, the northern border has actually seen an increase in illegal immigration. ""As we increasingly secure the southern border, won't that put more pressure on the northern border and other ports of entry?"" Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., asked John Kelly, Department of Homeland Security secretary, during an April 5 Senate committee hearing on border security and public safety. Kelly said security concerns were not at the same level in the northern border as they are in the southern border. But that sector also needs attention, he said. ""We obviously need to watch it, one of the things the Canadians recently did was to allow ... Mexicans to travel to Canada without visas and we're seeing a little bit of increase in Mexicans coming illegally into the United States from the north,"" Kelly said. (Since Dec. 1, 2016 Mexicans do not need a visa to visit Canada.) In all fiscal year 2016, there were 2,283 border patrol apprehensions at the northern border, compared to 408,870 at the southern border. Our ruling Trump said, ""Last month, we saw a 64 percent reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border."" It depends on how you define last month. The White House said Trump was speaking about year-over-year changes, from March 2016 to March 2017. Border patrol apprehensions declined 63.4 percent during that time. But if you looked at the decrease from February 2017 to March 2017, as Trump did just a month earlier, the decrease was about 35 percent. That difference would be lost on a listener.

"['National', 'Supreme Court', 'Ben Cardin']","
Did Senate Republicans filibuster Obama court nominees more than all others combined?
","Republicans changed Senate rules to break a Democratic filibuster and confirm Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court, and blamed Democrats for necessitating the change along the way. Democrats, as you might imagine, saw it differently. In a post-mortem on the Senate showdown, Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace asked Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., whether the Democrats’ made a strategic mistake deciding to filibuster Gorsuch’s nomination. Cardin said both parties are to blame, noting that Republicans engaged in the same type of action during President Barack Obama’s first term, when Republicans held up Obama’s judicial nominees. ""We’ve seen more filibusters on judicial nominees by the Republicans under President Obama than we saw in the whole history of the United States Senate,"" Cardin said April 9. ""Both sides have blame here."" We heard a similar claim on ABC’s This Week. Former DNC pollster Cornell Belcher said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ""who blocked more of President Obama's nominees than have been blocked in history."" Is that so? Defining, counting filibusters Cardin used the term ""filibuster,"" but measuring filibusters is troublesome, experts say, because it has an overly broad meaning. Senators tend to consider any type of obstruction to scheduling a nomination or measure as a filibuster, said Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. ""The whole use of the term filibuster is problematic, given its evolution over the years,"" added University of Kansas political scientist Burdett Loomis. ""It ends up being a regular event, used all the more frequently in more partisan Congresses."" As a result, experts say a way to approximate — but not entirely count — filibusters is to count the number of times the Senate attempts to break a filibuster by forcing an up-or-down vote through a process called cloture. In recent years, a cloture motion required the approval of 60 senators. But in 2013, Democrats changed the rules so that a simple majority could invoke cloture for presidential appointments and lower court nominees. The 60-vote threshold stood for legislation and the Supreme Court.   To confirm Gorsuch, Republicans eliminated the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees. It remains in place for legislation. What the research shows Cardin’s claim stems from a 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service, the independent research arm of Congress. The document, along with a subsequent memorandum on the report, lists every instance in which a presidential nominee was blocked and cloture was filed through Nov. 20, 2013, when Democrats changed Senate rules.   According to the Congressional Research Service, senators sought attempted cloture action on judicial nominations approximately 86 times between 1967 and the end of 2013. (Pre-1967, the Congressional Research Service lists no cloture attempts -- so ""history"" as Cardin put it, is relatively short.) Of those, 50 were made before President Barack Obama took office in 2009, and 36 were made between 2009 and when the Senate changed its rules in 2013. Miguel A. Estrada, a judge nominated in 2001 to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, saw seven cloture attempts to break a logjam by Senate Democrats before withdrawing his nomination in 2003.  So through that prism, Cardin is off. Cardin is closer if you look at individual judicial nominees who were subject to a cloture filing (because nominees like Estrada were subject to a cloture filing multiple times). Pre-Obama, 36 judicial nominees were subject to a cloture filing, we found. From 2009-2013, it was the same -- 36 judicial nominees. To put that in perspective, and to see Cardin's point, look at it this way: Less than one nominee per year was subject to a cloture filing in the 40 years before Obama took office. From 2009-13, the number of nominees subject to a cloture filing jumped to over seven per year. In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was much closer to being correct when he said, ""In the history of the United States, 168 presidential nominees have been filibustered, 82 blocked under President Obama, 86 blocked under all the other presidents."" His figure included non-judicial nominees. As part of that fact-check we noted that ""By our calculation, there were actually 68 individual nominees blocked prior to Obama taking office and 79 (so far) during Obama’s term, for a total of 147."" Senate Democrats made that same point in a tweet April 6. (Cardin's team said Sen. Chuck Schumer's inquiry on the Senate floor was the basis of Cardin's claim.)  Sen. Schumer asked the Parliamentarian to confirm this fact. The Secretary of the Senate, confirms this. pic.twitter.com/pYPLT1DUt2 Our ruling Cardin said, ""We’ve seen more filibusters on judicial nominees by the Republicans under President Obama than we saw in the whole history of the United States Senate."" Cardin used an imprecise term, ""filibuster,"" to describe a precise Senate parliamentary procedure, ""cloture."" As far as cloture data kept by the Congressional Research Service, Cardin would be on safer ground if he avoided focusing on ""judicial"" nominees. By our count, cloture was filed on 36 judicial nominations during the first five years of Obama's presidency, the same total as the previous 40 years combined.

"['Infrastructure', 'New York', 'Brian Higgins']","
Remaining train station options in Buffalo are not at Canalside
","Four locations remain under consideration for a new train station in Buffalo. Rep. Brian Higgins, D-Buffalo, wants the new station at the Central Terminal, an abandoned art deco marvel 2.5 miles east of downtown Buffalo. The Central Terminal was Buffalo’s main passenger station for 50 years until Amtrak pulled out in 1979. Higgins says the downtown Canalside location is a bad place for a train station. ""While I have argued here that Central Terminal is actually preferable from an affordability standpoint to the Canalside options, I have not wavered in my view that this important decision should not be reduced to a matter of mere dollars-and-cents,"" Higgins said. ""The Central Terminal alternative meets those two objectives in a way that Canalside never can."" Higgins has referred to two of the downtown options as Canalside locations in press releases on his website. Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown’s staff says Higgins is misleading the committee and the public by saying two of the four proposed locations are at Canalside. ""We have been trying to clarify all along that the sites we are looking at now are not at Canalside,"" Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown told The Buffalo News. ""They are all downtown."" So, who’s right? Where exactly are the options for a new train station? Downtown vs. Canalside Look at a map, and the Canalside and downtown sites are only a block or two apart on the railroad tracks -- hardly far enough to warrant such a dispute. Higgins says he uses definitions from a consultant’s report, which identified Canalside East and Canalside West as two possible locations. ""The report made public by the consultants on March 21 identifies two of the three locations as Canalside East and Canalside West,"" Higgins said in a statement. The Canalside West location in the report is where the Memorial Auditorium once stood. That option now appears to be off the table after an engineer determined it would be difficult to accommodate the city’s bus service at the location. The three remaining downtown options are within a few blocks of the old Aud site but are generally considered beyond the boundaries of Canalside: • The site of the current station on Exchange Street, less than a quarter mile off Washington Street downtown. The footprint would have another entrance at Washington Street. • Closer to Washington Street on Exchange Street. A second entry would be built between Washington Street and Main Street, across the light rail tracks from the old Aud site. • By the on-ramp to the I-190, across from the Courtyard Marriott. The consultants' report labeled this option Canalside East. It would be on the other side of the tracks from where the current Exchange Street station and closer to Washington Street. Part of that location is now a parking lot.  Behind the spat Higgins’ aides argue that the downtown locations would cut down on parking options for people who want to visit downtown Buffalo. That would hurt businesses and restaurants in a district where the state has spent millions to redevelop. Tim Tielman, who wants to preserve the Central Terminal but also supports a downtown train station, disputes that. ""The congressman keeps on reiterating that if a train station goes down there it will wreak havoc with things going on at Canalside,"" Tielman said. ""No. 1, I’d like to indicate that the trains are already there. ""The entire purpose of any urban development is to attract people and, of course, the most efficient way to attract people is through public transit,"" said Tielman, executive director of The Campaign for Greater Buffalo. Our ruling Higgins said in press releases on his website and in a memo to the Train Station Site Selection Committee that at least two options for a new train station in Buffalo are at Canalside. Imprecision in the consultant’s report added to the confusion because only one of the two possible sites labeled as ""Canalside"" locations in the report is actually within Canalside boundaries.   None of the options now being considered is at Canalside. Two of the options have entries across the street from Canalside to give passengers easier access to the city’s public transit system. That’s close to Canalside, but not in the district. Higgins’ claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/apr/09/brian-higgins/remaining-train-station-options-buffalo-are-not-ca/
"['Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Texas', 'Donna Campbell']","
Donna Campbell says due to low rates, 70 percent of physicians don't take new Medicaid patients
","In a March 2017 email blast, a Texas state senator who's a physician said that in a meeting with President Donald Trump, she’d promoted federal block grants as a way to give states more sway over the costs of Medicaid, the decades-old federal-state insurance program for the poor and disabled. Donna Campbell, R-New Braunfels, then declared: ""Seven out of ten doctors are not taking any new Medicaid patients as lower reimbursement rates make it cost-prohibitive."" Really? Let’s gauge physician acceptance of Medicaid patients, then the program's payments. A Senate aide to Campbell, Curtis Buckley, said by email that Campbell based her 7-out-of-10 statistic on a 2012 Texas Medical Association survey indicating 44 percent of doctors were declining new Medicaid patients, 26 percent limited such patients and 31 percent accepted new Medicaid patients without restriction. Indeed, in 2013, we found Mostly True a claim tied to that survey that 31 percent of Texas physicians were accepting all new Medicaid patients. Those figures, we noted, were based on poll responses rather than hard numbers. There's fresher data. The group's 2016 survey, which we fielded from TMA spokesman Steve Levine, found 38 percent of physicans accepting no new Medicaid patients, 21 percent limiting such patients and 41 percent accepting new Medicaid patients without restriction. Both surveys, that is, indicated about four in 10 Texas practices not accepting new Medicaid patients. Levine, asked why the association surveys suggest some inching up in the share of Texas physicians accepting all Medicaid patients, said a factor was a provision in the 2010 Obamacare law that temporarily raised Medicaid rates paid for services by certain physicians. Buckley, Campbell’s aide, also pointed out a 2014 study by Merritt Hawkins, a Dallas-based health-focused consulting firm, testing Medicaid acceptance rates in Dallas and Houston. His nudge led us to find another Merritt Hawkins study, were released just before Campbell made her claim. It indicates that nationally as of early 2017, 53 percent of 1,414 contacted physician practices in major metro areas were accepting Medicaid insurance with 60 percent of 494 practices in mid-sized metro areas doing so. Acceptance rates were lower, though, in cities where different kinds of practices (cardiology, dermatology, obstetrics-gynecology, orthopedic surgery and family medicine) were queried by phone in January-February 2017. On average, 17 percent of Dallas practices, 26 percent of Odessa practices and 37 percent of Houston practices, respectively, reported accepting new Medicaid patients. The 2017 report said: ""The rate at which physicians accept Medicaid can vary for a number of reasons. In some cases, reimbursement rates provided by Medicaid to particular specialists may be below their cost of providing services. If not actually below costs, Medicaid reimbursement often is relatively low compared to that offered by other payers, and busy physicians may have no economic incentive to see Medicaid patients. In other cases, the process of billing for and receiving Medicaid payment can be problematic and some physicians choose to avoid it."" A Merritt Hawkins spokesman, Phil Miller, pointed us to yet another report, though its focus wasn't on acceptance of ""new"" Medicaid patients. The 2016 national survey of 17,200 physicians conducted by the company for the Physicians Foundation, which says it seeks to empower physicians to lead in the delivery of high-quality, cost-efficient healthcare, found 16 percent not seeing Medicaid patients, 20 percent limiting such patients and 64 percent accepting Medicaid patients. A chart based on the survey showed variations among states -- and that nearly 30 percent of Texas physicians did not accept Medicaid patients. State data Next, we asked the Texas Health and Human Services Commission for data on Texas physicians and Medicaid patients. By email, Christine Mann sent a spreadsheet indicating that in fiscal 2016, which ran through August 2016, 63,915 Texas physicians were enrolled in Medicaid, including 31,585 primary-care doctors. The sheet further says that as of September 2016, per the Texas Medical Board, 74,098 physicians were licensed to practice in Texas. So, about 85 percent of the state’s physicians had a connection to Medicaid, though Levine separately said that could overly represent doctors who only occasionally treat Medicaid patients in emergency rooms and in unusual circumstances. But the commission’s data showed that only 32,130 Texas physicians reported a paid Medicaid claim in fiscal 2016. Those doctors amounted to about 43 percent of physicians licensed to practice in the state. Yet there’s a twist to that too, Miller helped us recognize: Data tracked by the Texas Department of State Health Services shows that in 2016, the state had 50,948 ""direct patient care physicians,"" meaning doctors who worked directly with patients as opposed to those who were researchers, administrators or teachers. If you assume direct-care doctors predominantly submitted the tallied paid claims, then you can hypothesize that 63 percent of active physicians had a paid Medicaid claim. Levine commented: ""Still–having one Medicaid claim paid is not nearly the same as taking new (let alone all new) Medicaid patients."" Other analyses For broader perspective, we turned to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which focuses on national health issues and said in a March 2017 web post that nationally, about 70 percent of office-based physicians accept new Medicaid patients. That figure is a little old; it traces to a 2015 study based on the 2013 National Electronic Health Records Survey, a nationally representative survey that collects information on physician and practice characteristics. According to the results, 68.9 percent of U.S. office-based physicians who accepted any new patients were accepting new Medicaid patients--with 57.6 percent of such Texas physicians doing so:                  We sought more recent data and Jeff Lancashire of the National Center for Health Statistics emailed us an excerpt from the 2015 NEHRS survey indicating 28.2 percent of primary-care physicians weren't accepting new Medicaid patients with 71.6 percent accepting such patients--with Texas-specific results yet to be posted, the center's Corey Slavitt told us. After Campbell made her statement, FactCheck.org, a fact-checking effort based at the University of Pennsylvania, posted a lengthy analysis of flaws in claims about low physician participation in Medicaid. ""There are no continuous measures on Medicaid participation,"" that story says, ""but federal statistics gathered over recent years show that the percentage of physicians accepting new Medicaid patients has remained around 70 percent,"" though the story says participation rates have been affected by differences in state-specific reimbursement rates. Medicaid fees Campbell’s aide, Buckley, said her reference to lower Medicaid fees tied to her professional background and her understanding that Medicaid fees have long been a factor in doctors not accepting or limiting new Medicaid patients. Buckley also pointed out a June 2016 analysis published by the TMA confirming that in Texas, ""reimbursement amounts for the same procedures differ among payers, with public payers (Medicare and Medicaid) setting a much lower rate than"" what private payers offer. Our hunt for expertise led us to Stephen Zuckerman, co-director of the Health Policy Center at the Washington, D.C.-based Urban Institute, which has surveyed state-set Medicaid fees since 1993. On March 5, 2017, the institute posted a report co-authored by Zuckerman indicating that in July 2016, Medicaid fees paid Texas physicians amounted, on average, to 65 percent of fees paid in the state by federally funded Medicare; nationally, Medicaid fees averaged 72 percent of Medicare fees. In Texas, the report says, Medicaid fees paid for primary care services in 2016 were 58 percent of Medicare fees; for obstetric services, 66 percent; and for other services, 85 percent. A chart in the report indicates 2016 Medicaid fees paid Texas physicians were up slightly, 0.2 percent, from 2014 and those fees amounted to 88 percent of average Medicaid fees paid nationally. By phone, Zuckerman said Medicaid’s relatively lower fees definitely influence some physician decisions to accept patients. Zuckerman said doctors also cite the hassles of signing up for Medicaid and submitting claims. Another expert, the Kaiser foundation’s Julia Paradise, said by phone that Medicaid fees and physician participation comprise part of the story. A broader issue, she said, is whether Medicaid beneficiaries have access to providers. In that vein, Zuckerman pointed out a University of Pennsylvania study published in March 2017 finding that in 2016, appointments could be scheduled by phone by Texas Medicaid patients with about 60 percent of primary-care physicians--an insignificant change from 2013, the researchers wrote. Texas private-pay patients were able to schedule appointments with more than 80 percent of primary-care physicians, the researchers found. Our ruling Campbell said: ""Seven out of ten doctors are not taking any new Medicaid patients as lower reimbursement rates make it cost-prohibitive."" Texas Medicaid payment rates indeed trail those for other kinds of insurance. But the crux of this statement, the 7-in-10 statistic, lacks factual footing partly because it combines different answers to an outdated Texas physician survey. In contrast, a 2016 national survey indicated about 2 in 10 U.S. physicians were not accepting Medicaid patients with about 6 in 10 accepting them. The same year, a survey found about four in 10 Texas doctors weren't accepting new Medicaid patients. It's worth noting, still, a 2017 study suggesting far more Texas specialists weren't accepting new Medicaid patients. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Mark Pocan wrongly claims Donald Trump had no legal authority to launch missile attack on Syria
","The morning after the U.S. cruise missiles assault on a Syrian air base, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan questioned the legal authority of President Donald Trump to order the attack. ""There is no legal basis for last night’s missile strike against Syrian military assets,"" the Madison-area Democrat declared in a statement on April 7, 2017. ""Congress must be called back immediately, if President Trump plans to escalate our military involvement. He must send a new Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) to Congress, as I have previously called for."" The 59-missile assault was launched in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack by the government against Syrian civilians two days earlier. News reports quoted U.S. officials as saying Trump had the right to use force to defend national interests and to protect civilians from atrocities. Meanwhile, first-term U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Green Bay, while praising the ""limited strikes,"" also said Trump ""should seek congressional authorization for any sustained military operation in Syria."" There’s certainly debate over the extent of a president’s authority to use military force without approval from Congress. But Pocan went too far in saying there is no legal basis for Trump’s action. Competing arguments To support Pocan’s claim, his office noted the U.S. Constitution assigns to Congress the power to declare war, and sent us commentary on that provision and the missile attack by the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU reiterated its position that ""the decision to use military force requires Congress’ specific, advance authorization."" Pocan also cited the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which was enacted over a veto by Republican President Richard Nixon. It says ""the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities"" can be done only ""pursuant to a declaration of war, specific statutory authorization, or a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces."" And Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, an assistant attorney general under Republican President George W. Bush, argued in 2013 that Democratic President Barack Obama didn’t have unilateral authority to launch attacks against Syria, as was being considered at the time. Goldsmith said the president’s authority to use force without congressional approval had been extended to protect American persons and property abroad, but that rationale would not have applied to the attacks Obama contemplated (but never carried out). The Trump administration, meanwhile, also invokes the Constitution (Article 2) in asserting that the president has the power to defend the U.S. national interest. In this case, that interest is described as ""promoting regional stability, which the use of chemical weapons threatens"" -- which the Trump administration likened to the Obama administration’s justification for using force in Libya in 2011. Other views Experts agree that in limited instances, such as the Syrian missile attack, a president has legal authority provided in the Constitution as commander-in chief. Cameron University history and government professor Lance Janda said he agrees with Pocan’s call for a new congressional authorization for use of force, adding: ""We have not declared war on anyone since 1941, and yet we are the most active nation state on the planet when it comes to military action."" But ""having said that,"" Janda continued, the Constitution gives the president authority as commander in chief to use force to protect our national interests and War Powers Resolution gives the president ""leeway to respond to attacks or other emergencies."" McGill University professor of international relations Mark Brawley also said the president has authority to use military force in a crisis, but then should notify Congress within 48 hours. The president also should ask Congress for authority to use military force if there will be extended conflict, or for a declaration of war, if the United States will be at war with Syria, he said. Like the Trump administration, Georgetown University professor Anthony Arend, whose specialties include international relations and constitutional law of U.S. foreign relations, also cited Article 2 of the Constitution and the president’s power as commander-in-chief. He told us: ""While the precise scope of this power is unclear, a strong argument can be made that the president can use force in short military operations -- especially where there is minimal risk to American lives -- without congressional authorization. Indeed, over the years, Congress has generally acquiesced in such presidential uses of force. ""Because the air strikes were undertaken by cruise missiles that put virtually no American lives at risk and because the strikes lasted only minutes, the president's action would seem to be a lawful use of force under the Constitution. Needless to say, if further military actions were to be undertaken, they could rise to the level of requiring congressional authorization."" Added Richard Stoll, an international conflict scholar at Rice University, about the Trump attack: ""This is not new."" Stoll said he would advise a president to get congressional approval before taking additional action, but presidents many times have taken a ""one-off"" action such as the Syrian attack. Those views correspond to a 2013 fact check of then-U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, who said Obama would have had the legal authority to strike Syria without a vote from Congress. PolitiFact National’s rating was True. As our colleagues reported: Since the last time Congress declared war, at the beginning of World War II, presidents have generally initiated military activities using their constitutionally granted powers as commander in chief without having an official declaration of war in support of their actions. Even under the War Powers Resolution, the president can send in forces without approval from Congress. Lower courts have ruled in favor of the White House in the use of force, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal on that point. Our rating Pocan said: ""There is no legal basis"" for Trump's ""missile strike against Syrian military assets."" For limited military activities like the missile strike, presidents can send in forces without approval from Congress.

"['Alcohol', 'Pennsylvania', 'Wendell Young']","
Wait, there could be how many new liquor stores in PA?
","Could a bill moving through the statehouse bring 2,000 new liquor stores to Pennsylvania? United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1776 President Wendell Young estimated that figure in an op-ed for PennLive, opposing two pieces of proposed legislation that would expand liquor sales outside of state stores. He noted that a bill sponsored by State Rep. Adam Harris, a Republican from Juniata County, might yield that increase. ""The Harris bill (HB991) would allow some existing retailers to operate a ‘franchise store,’ which is a liquor store operating inside of an existing retail shop,"" Young wrote last week. ""Just think of a mini liquor store next to the potato chips at your corner grocery store. The bill could lead to the opening of as many as 2,000 new liquor stores."" Last summer, the state legislature passed a bill that made it legal to buy wine in (select) grocery stores for the first time since Prohibition. Pro-privatization advocates argue that loosening the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board’s grip on sales could lead to an economic boon, while providing more options for consumers, particularly rural ones. Advocates against expanding private retail, like Young, contend that a cash-strapped state can’t afford the loss in revenue. ""Pennsylvania has a very successful wine and spirits system... that benefits all taxpayers whether they drink or not,"" said Young. ""You don’t have to be a genius to figure it out, if you dilute Pennsylvania’s market, you’re going to cannibalize sales."" The Liquor Control Board currently administers 608 state stores. Harris’ bill, which dropped ""franchise store"" for ""retail store"" in its current language, would indeed allow for a dramatic spike. Per the bill itself, ""Licenses may be issued at a ratio of one per every 6,000 residents within a county, with a minimum of 15 licenses granted to a county."" But the bill would place some limits within those margins: Stores wouldn’t be licensed in dry towns or ""within 1,200 yards of a Pennsylvania Liquor Store or retail store in an urbanized area, or within two miles of a Pennsylvania Liquor Store or retail store in a rural area."" The bill, which passed in committee on Monday, would require that licensed retailers purchase their stock through the Liquor Control Board. The Census estimated the state’s population to be 12,784,227 residents for 2016. Divided by 6,000, that would make way for roughly 2,130 stores before distance stipulations came into play. But since the bill notes that licenses would be granted by county, the union went further in its analysis. Chris Naylor, legislative and political director for UFCW Local 1776, provided this outline of how they devised their estimate: ""Philadelphia at 1,548,647 people would be divided by 6,000, which would result in 258 potential licenses in the city of Philadelphia alone. For the surrounding counties, Montgomery would be at approx 134 potential licenses, Bucks at 104 licenses, Delco at 93 licenses and Chester at 84 licenses. Do this math over every county in the state, and you will have over 2,000 potential licenses as a result of HB 991. You also have to take into account that the legislation calls for a minimum of 15 licenses granted to a county; so the counties that fall below 90,000 residents (6,000 residents multiplied by the minimum of 15 retail outlets per county) would also appear to have 15 potential licenses per county. There are over 30 counties in the state that fall into this category, also increasing the potential number of outlets.""

""We might lower the maximum per county (regardless of population) to something lower than 15.  I am open to discussing this possibility with my colleagues and the Governor,"" Harris hinted later in an email. ""The ‘fencing’ language (how far a retail outlet has to be from a current LCB store) could be amended to provide for a greater buffer area… If we expand the fencing this could impact how many retail licenses ultimately come into existence.""   Our ruling Wendell Young, president of Local 1776, wrote in an op-ed that HB 991 ""could lead to the opening of as many as 2,000 new liquor stores."" Even though the bill sponsor doesn’t think the legislation would create that many new locations, Young’s estimate was indisputably fair here.

Ellen Troxclair incorrectly says Austin's city taxes surged as family incomes inched up
","An Austin City Council member declared that city property taxes have lately surged with family incomes failing to keep up. Ellen Troxclair, who represents District 8 in Southwest Austin, told Lauren Petrowski of Austin’s Fox 7 on a February 2017 edition of ""Good Day Austin"" that she wants the city this year to ""move the needle"" versus the local cost of living. In the interview, Troxclair touted her affordability action plan, which was set aside by the council a week later. Troxclair: ""Since 2012, property taxes have gone up almost 30 percent—"" Petrowski: ""Wow."" Troxclair: ""—while incomes have only risen 4 percent. So people are really struggling to stay in the city."" Let’s gauge the proclaimed tax changes, then the described changes in income. City taxes up? By email, Troxclair aide Alice Claiborne said the nearly 30 percent statistic was derived by comparing the city property tax bill on a median-valued non-senior homestead as reported in the city budget for 2016-17 with the bill on a median-valued residence as stated in the city’s 2011-12 budget. The budget for fiscal 2011-12, which began in October 2011, states: ""The median property tax bill is estimated at $879 per year"" on a median-priced residence. The 2016-17 city budget estimated the city property tax bill on that year’s median-valued non-senior homestead at $1,132.96--which was 29 percent greater than the noted 2011-12 figure. Yet, we noticed, that comparison looked at different classifications of property. Single-family residences sweep in stand-alone homes, townhouses, condominiums, row houses and mobile homes regardless of who lives there. ""Homestead"" refers to an owner-occupied residence that can qualify for tax breaks. In 2016, according to the Travis Central Appraisal District, Austin had 183,423 single-family residences; 130,253 Austin property owners claimed a homestead exemption. By email, a city budget official, Ed Van Eenoo, advised that at the council's direction, the estimated tax bill in the 2016-17 budget was limited to non-senior homesteads, meaning those properties affected by increased exemptions adopted by the council. He confirmed that was a change from the 2011-12 budget. To reach a balanced comparison, we asked for the appropriate 2011-12 figure to compare with the 2016-17 tax estimate. Van Eenoo replied that the city tax tab for the median-value non-senior homestead in 2011-12 was $967.02. The 2016-17 tax bill for that type of homestead was 17 percent--not 29 percent--greater. Homestead tax changes Even so, we realized, that percentage doesn’t reflect actual changes in city-levied taxes for any given property. For starters, increases in the median-valued homestead were influenced by new and more valuable homes landing on the tax roll. Beyond that factor, we wondered how much more actual homeowners faced in 2016-17 city taxes compared with what the homeowners paid in 2011-12. To gauge that, we turned to Marya Crigler, chief appraiser for the appraisal district, which appraises local properties for taxation purposes. We asked Crigler to focus on city taxes on specific homesteads occupied by the same owner or owners in the period so we could see how each homeowner fared by 2016. Crigler emailed us tax data for eight geographically dispersed Austin homesteads whose owners in 2011-12 had paid city taxes of $967, which was then the bill for the city’s median non-senior homestead. Results: Seven sampled properties faced higher taxes in 2016 than 2011 or 2012, but the differences varied widely, from 3 percent to 24 percent—and one homestead, in East Austin east of U.S. 183, faced 4 percent less in taxes for 2016 than 2012. On average, the taxes levied in 2016 were 11 percent higher than the taxes levied in 2011 and 8 percent up from 2012. Location mattered. Among the homesteads, the smallest tax differences showed up on suburban properties, the biggest on urban-core homesteads in East Austin and west of MoPac Boulevard, the spreadsheet shows. Crigler also emailed us a chart showing that by TCAD’s calculations, the $1,137 in city taxes due on a median-value homestead in 2016 was $124 or 12 percent greater than the $1,013 due on a median-value homestead in 2012. Significantly, Crigler said, the 2016 figures take into account the curbing effect on tax bills from state homestead appraised-value limits plus the local homestead tax exemptions approved by the council that year. So, Austin’s homestead property taxes were almost universally higher in 2016 than five years previous. But for the most part, homeowners weren’t socked as hard as Troxclair's ""almost 30 percent"" suggests. Van Eenoo, when we asked, had no quibble with Crigler’s figures. Michael Searle, Troxclair’s chief of staff, questioned our focus on homesteads rather than single-family dwellings. ""I would say that looking only at homesteads gives a narrow picture,"" Searle emailed. We tried to check on changes in taxes on median-value single-family dwellings. Van Eenoo said, though, the finance staff did not have a 2016 figure comparable to the 2011-12 budget’s figure. He said the council in 2016 directed it to focus on taxes on homesteads, enabling members to track the effect of the council-adopted increases in homestead tax exemptions. Family incomes Next, we turned to Troxclair’s claim about minimal changes in local incomes. Claiborne and Searle told us city staffers gave Troxclair the figures she relied on to gauge changes in Austin’s median family income. The provided figures suggest a median family income of $78,671 for 2017—which would be up $3,771, or 5 percent, from the presented median family income in 2011 of $74,900. The projected 2017 figure would be up $2,771, 3.7 percent, from Troxclair’s cited 2012 median family income of $75,900. Asked about those income figures, the city demographer, Ryan Robinson, told us that he wasn’t familiar with a 2017 projection, but the figures for previous years reflected data covering families in the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos region, not just Austin, that are annually put together by the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development. Robinson pointed us to a HUD website where we spotted the median family income figures provided by Troxclair’s office for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2011 and 2012. So, median family incomes in the Austin area—extending beyond Austin and Travis County to include Bastrop, Caldwell, Hays and Williamson counties—escalated nearly 4 percent from 2012 to what’s projected for 2017. But that’s a regional figure. We endeavored to seek Austin-only numbers. Austin-only income changes And to our inquiry, a U.S. Census Bureau spokeswoman, Jewel Jordan, pointed us to its estimates of median family incomes in Austin alone, which were based on the bureau’s American Community Survey results for 2011 through 2015. That research suggests bigger jumps in median family income among Austin residents. According to the bureau, Austin’s 2015 median family income of $76,629 was up nearly 13 percent from the $68,023 median family income of Austin residents in 2012 and up 20 percent from the $63,672 median family income of Austinites in 2011. In the same years, the number of Austin families escalated from 66,158 in 2011 and 66,474 in 2012 to 73,928 in 2015 (a three-year, 11 percent increase). Next, we adjusted the dollar figures for inflation: Median Family Incomes for Austin in 2015 Dollars YEAR AMOUNT INCREASE/DECREASE ($s) % CHANGE % CHANGE from 2012 2011 $67,090 na na na 2012 $70,222 $3,132 4.7 na 2013 $72,757 $2,535 3.6 3.6 2014 $76,754 $3,997 5.5 9.3 2015 $76,629 ($125) (0.2) 9.1 na=Not applicable SOURCES: American FactFinder, American Community Survey, 1-Year Results, 2011-2015, U.S. Census Bureau and CPI Inflation Calculator, Bureau of Labor Statistics  (accessed March 16 and 22, 2017) For our part, we also wondered if—just as an influx of higher-value housing arguably dampened existing homeowners’ property tax bites—a portion of the indicated family income gains reflected new residents filling new higher-wage jobs rather than workers in Austin at the start of the period soaking up pay gains. Unfortunately, we didn’t divine a way to figure that out. We noticed otherwise that the Census Bureau’s Austin surveys suggest slightly favorable changes: In 2011, about 26 percent of Austin families had incomes of less than $35,000 while in 2015, that share was down to 21.6 percent. Conversely, in Austin in 2011, 15.8 percent of families had incomes of $150,000 or more while in 2015, 18.8 percent of families were at that level. Troxclair, informed of the bureau’s city-specific income estimates, didn’t defend her reliance on HUD’s regional figures. She noted that city staff had provided her with the regional figures in response to her request for the ""average increase in income in Austin"" over recent years. City staff comments By email, Van Eenoo, the city’s deputy chief financial officer, confirmed that a colleague had submitted the regional figures to Troxclair’s office without clarifying they weren’t city-only numbers. He further said city staff had calculated the region’s median family income for 2017 by applying the 10-year compound annual growth rate to HUD’s 2016 figure. Van Eenoo, asked why it makes sense to rely on HUD’s regional estimates, noted they’re more up to date than the bureau’s city-specific estimates. Notably too, Van Eenoo said, the HUD data series is the ""official data series used to determine eligibility for a wide range of affordable housing programs. We therefore have often relied on the HUD data series because it is the most current official government data series and tracks with other evaluations of housing affordability, whereas relying on the ACS data would require us to make independent projections of income two years into the future in order to compare income versus current property tax levels."" We sought his comment on the bureau figures showing median family incomes in Austin trailing the regional HUD estimates; Van Eenoo said city staff hadn’t researched that in depth. Our ruling Troxclair said: ""Since 2012,"" city of Austin ""property taxes have gone up almost 30 percent while incomes have only risen 4 percent."" Both percentages, we found, have flaws enfeebling this admittedly difficult comparison. In our attempt to be precise, we estimate that city taxes on homesteads in 2016 were up around 8 percent to 11 percent from a few years before with Austin’s median family income in 2015 about 9 percent higher than the city’s median family income in 2012 (though this also almost certainly doesn't reflect income changes for the same specific families). Upshot: City taxes mostly were up, but largely to a lesser degree than Troxclair suggested. Also, the cited regional income figures reflected lesser gains for families than Austin-only estimates available from the Census Bureau. We rate the statement False.

(Mostly) men-only: Three-quarters of town boards in Wisconsin have no women members
","How underrepresented are women in elected offices in Wisconsin? ""Horrifyingly underrepresented,"" says Erin Forrest, executive director of Emerge Wisconsin, which helps Democratic women run for office. Forrest responded to the question on the April 2, 2017 edition of ""Capital City Sunday,"" a public affairs program on Madison’s WKOW-TV. Then she made several statistical claims, including one with a huge figure: ""Seventy-five percent of the town boards in Wisconsin,"" Forrest claimed, ""have no women on them at all."" Nearly one in every three Wisconsin residents live in what are largely rural towns. Are the town boards really so dominated by men? Candidates and the group The program began with an interview of state Sen. Leah Vukmir, a suburban Milwaukee Republican who is considering a run against first-term U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Madison Democrat, in 2018. Even with the election more than a year and a half away, Baldwin was hit a couple of weeks earlier with a Super PAC attack claiming she ""supported legislation allowing citizens to withhold funding for our troops."" Our rating was Mostly False, given that the measure would have been largely symbolic. To balance Vukmir’s appearance on the show, Forrest was interviewed. Emerge Wisconsin, which offers a six-month training program for Democratic women who want to run for office, reported that after the election of Donald Trump, it had its largest group of applicants. Now to Forrest’s claim. The numbers In Wisconsin, a town is the form of local government in areas that are not within the boundaries of cities or villages. About 30 percent of Wisconsin residents live in towns, according to the Wisconsin Towns Association. One of the state’s 1,255 towns, according to the Wisconsin Blue Book, is also a county -- Menominee. It has seven town board members (four women and three men), who also serve as county supervisors, while most town boards have only three members, each of whom are elected to two-year terms. To back her claim, Forrest referred us to a report released in April 2016 on women elected to judicial, executive and legislative offices in Wisconsin at the state and local government levels (including school districts). Current as of 2015, it is the latest edition of a report that is produced every five years by the Wisconsin Women’s Council, a state body whose members are appointed by the governor and legislative leaders. The data was collected by the Research Center for Women and Girls at Alverno College in Milwaukee. The report highlighted two findings in comparing 2015 to the first report, done in 2005: 23 percent of elected officials were women, up from 20 percent 3,100 women held elected office, up from 2,800 As for town boards, the report found, 75 percent of them had no women -- the same as in 2005. Town boards are the least likely among Wisconsin local governing bodies to have gender diversity, the study found. Women account for only 9 percent of town supervisors (the same as in 2010, but up from 7 percent in 2005). Women were most represented on tribal councils, holding 42 percent of the seats, the same as 2005, and on the state Supreme Court, holding five of the seven seats. Other perspectives Mike Koles, executive director of the Wisconsin Towns Association, said women are far more represented among town clerks and treasurers, the vast majority of which are elected positions. We looked for any other reports on elected women in Wisconsin, checking with the Wisconsin Towns Association, the Local Government Institute of Wisconsin, the University of Wisconsin Extension, Wisconsin Women in Government and the Wisconsin Federation of Republican Women, but didn’t find any that were aware of any other data on Wisconsin’s town boards. They don’t bear on this fact check, but we did find other studies that looked more generally at women elected officials in Wisconsin. State Legislature: 31 of the 132 members of the Wisconsin Legislature are women -- with that 23.5 percent slightly below the national rate of 24.8 percent, according to a February 2017 report by the non-profit National Conference of State Legislatures. County to federal: Wisconsin ranked 17th on a measure of representativeness that looked at race and gender among elected officials from the county to federal levels, according to a 2014 national report. It was commissioned by the Women Donors Network, which describes itself as a progressive group of women philanthropists. White women were 42 percent of Wisconsin’s population and comprised 22 percent of elected officials. For women of color, the percentages were 9 percent and 3 percent. Why they don’t run: Women expressed less confidence than men about their ability to run for and hold public office, according to a UW Extension survey of 600 county board supervisors and people identified as potential candidates for local office in 38 Wisconsin counties. The surveys were done in summer 2015 and the results were published in February 2016. Two of the findings: 71 percent of men compared to 60 percent of women said they were well-qualified to run; nearly 19 percent of women said ""making decisions in public"" acted as a barrier to running, while less than 5 percent of men felt that way.

Tom Cotton: It's 'unusual' for White House officials like Susan Rice to make unmasking requests
","Some Republicans have latched onto allegations about former National Security Adviser Susan Rice to bolster their narrative that President Barack Obama’s administration misused intelligence for political purposes. A few media sources, most prominently Bloomberg columnist Eli Lake, have said Rice repeatedly asked to learn the names of unidentified American citizens who appeared in intelligence reports in connection to the Donald Trump campaign and transition. These reports are based on anonymous sources, and Rice has neither confirmed nor denied them. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said Congress should investigate because if the story is true, it’s strange that someone in Rice’s White House position would request for names to be unmasked. ""You're right that it's not necessarily illegal,"" Cotton said in an April 4 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. ""It is unusual, though. The White House doesn't conduct criminal investigations. The White House doesn't conduct counterintelligence investigations. The White House is a consumer of intelligence. Normally, those kind of unmasking requests would be done by the agencies responsible for those activities."" However, experts in intelligence collection and classified information told us it’s normal for someone in such a high-up national security role to make unmasking requests, and it would be hard, though not impossible, to abuse the practice for political purposes. ""It’s not unusual at all,"" said Joshua Rovner, chair of international politics and national security at Southern Methodist University and author of Fixing the Facts: National Security and the Politics of Intelligence. What ‘unmasking’ is and how it works We couldn’t find a way to quantify how often national security advisers or other White House officials make unmasking requests, but experts said it’s a routine, legitimate occurrence. The FBI and NSA regularly produce reports for government customers. The customer could be another investigating agency, Congress, the Justice Department or the White House. If an American’s name appears in a piece of intelligence — for example, if agents intercept a conversation between two foreign nationals who mention an American friend in passing — those preparing the report generally ""mask"" the American’s name, replacing it with something like ""U.S. Person."" The recipient of the report might decide that in order to fully understand the intelligence, they need to know the ""U.S. Person’s"" identity. So they make a request for the name to be unmasked, and the agency that produced the report either approves or denies the request. The NSA approved 654 requests in 2015, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It’s not just agencies conducting criminal or counterintelligence investigations that make the unmasking requests, as Cotton said. It’s anyone who consumes intelligence reports. ""The national security adviser, who is a consumer of the most selective and restricted intelligence products, would certainly be entitled to request unmasking in the course of his or her duties,"" said Steven Aftergood, who directs the Federation of American Scientists’ Project on Government Secrecy. For example, a national security adviser might learn from an intelligence report that a foreign agent is trying to cultivate an unnamed U.S. official. They would need to know the official’s name in order to alert him or her in advance, or to get a full picture of the situation, Rovner said. Unmasking for political purposes? Implied in Cotton’s statement is that Rice may have made unmasking requests for political purposes. The idea is that an official could use unmasking requests to surreptitiously dig up information about a U.S. citizen, such as a political opponent, without a warrant to surveil them. But experts said abusing the unmasking process would be difficult, in large part because the agency does the actual unmasking, not the requester. The official who wants to abuse the process would have to get agency workers on board with her plan because they would have to make sure she receives reports about the American in question. They would also have to make sure that any unmasking request would be granted, said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty & National Security Program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, a civil liberties group. ""It’s certainly not an easy or direct route to spying on political opponents,"" she said, adding that there are other provisions of surveillance laws that are far more susceptible to abuse. Only a select group of high-up officials in the intelligence and national security communities have the authority to make or approve unmasking requests, and they have to do so while complying with an elaborate set of minimization guidelines, compliance procedures and documentation, said Susan Hennessey, a national security fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former NSA lawyer. These procedures, along with the intelligence community’s extreme sensitivity to accusations of political abuse, likely deters intelligence officials from complying with illegitimate unmasking requests, Rovner said. Hennessey added that the media reports about Rice are so inconsistent and vague that it’s not really possible to assess whether the unmasking requests in question (if they occurred) were legitimate. But ""I have not seen anything in the public record that indicates there is any kind of problem here,"" she said. Our ruling Cotton said, ""It is unusual"" for a White House official like former National Security Adviser Susan Rice to make unmasking requests. As the president’s top consultant on issues of national security, Rice and other national security advisers consume a large amount of intelligence. There are numerous legitimate reasons why Rice might ask an intelligence agency to reveal the identity of an unnamed person in an intelligence report. It might not be an everyday occurrence, but it is not so ""unusual"" as to raise suspicion, as Cotton said.

Trump's environmental awards: A closer look
","At a town hall with CEOs, President Donald Trump said his administration will be able to get rid of 90 to 95 percent of regulations ""and still have the same kind of protection."" ""We want safety and we want environmental protection,"" Trump said April 4. ""I've won awards on environmental protection. I'm a big believer, believe it or not. But we want that kind of protection. We want clean air and we want clean water, but we shouldn’t have to get the approvals from 16 different agencies for almost the same thing."" Many readers asked us to look into Trump’s statement about his environmental awards. It’s something he’s said before. At a 2015 campaign rally in Iowa, even as Trump scoffed at environmental regulations -- as in ""a snail, or turtle or snake or something"" that blocked projects -- he said his environmental bona fides were sound. ""I’m a big believer in clean air and clean water,"" he said Dec. 11, 2015. ""I have gotten so many awards for the environment."" While Trump might have talked about ""many awards"" in Iowa, here, we’re simply looking for at least two. The White House pointed to the two it knows about. A New Jersey golf course In 2007, one of Trump’s golf courses got an award. The Metropolitan Golf Association gave its first annual environmental award to the Bedminster New Jersey Trump National Golf Course. How much credit did Trump get? Some. The man who accepted the award on behalf of the golf course, Greg Nicoll, got his moment in the sun, too.   The association’s announcement said Nicoll ""has been an environmental leader among Met Area clubs. Through the leadership of Donald J. Trump, Nicoll has implemented an environmental strategy that has resulted in the preservation of a dedicated 45 acre grassland bird habitat on the property, as well as intensive erosion control and stream stabilization management plan."" So it wasn’t a personal prize for Trump, but the golfing club certainly gave him a thumbs up. Trump did get personal recognition in the second award on the White House’s list. (Hat tip to the Washington Post Fact-checker.) Forest land in New York It seems 2007 was a good year for Trump and the environment. That year, the Friends of Westchester County Parks gave Trump its inaugural Green Space Award for donating over 400 acres to the state park system. The group’s treasurer, Chris Frawley, said, ""It is with heartfelt gratitude that we honor Mr. Trump for his vision and commitment to preservation of open space."" Interestingly, there’s a golf connection here, too, and a backstory of Trump’s experience with environmental permitting. Trump had bought land in Yorktown, about 35 miles north of Manhattan, with plans to turn forest and meadows into a 155-acre golf course. He spent four years trying to win approval, but hit delays due mainly to wetlands on the property and its proximity to a drinking water reservoir. Golf courses use a bevy of chemicals to maintain the turf essential to the game. Jim Tierney, an assistant state attorney general overseeing New York City's watershed, told the New York Times that Trump’s golf course in Yorktown would have been within a mile or so of the New Croton Reservoir, an unfiltered drinking water source for 900,000 city and county residents. ''Once something gets into the drinking water, it doesn't get filtered out,'' Tierney told the newspaper. ''It comes out of the faucet.'' In 2002, Trump pulled the plug on the project. In a letter announcing his decision, as reported by the New York Post, Trump told the Yorktown supervisor, ""You have done a terrible disservice to your constituents who have sadly lost out on a tremendous opportunity."" The town said it was still working to resolve issues with Trump when he withdrew his plans. Trump saw it differently. ''I think the approval process in Westchester is even more difficult than the approval process in Manhattan,'' Trump told the New York Times. ''But in a perverse way, they've done me a favor because the land has gotten more valuable.'' Trump’s letter said he could make more money selling the land to home builders than developing it for golf. Ultimately, after a few years, he decided to donate the land. The state created the Donald J. Trump State Park, and Trump got his award. There’s a coda to that: In 2010, budget cuts led the state to say it would no longer maintain the park lands. Trump said ""If they’re going to close it, I’ll take the land back,"" according to news reports. He didn’t take further action. It's worth noting that these two awards were not from major environmental groups such as the Sierra Club or the Environmental Defense Fund. They were from local groups for specific projects. Our ruling Trump said that he has won awards for environmental protection. The White House pointed to two that include his name. One thanked him personally for donating over 400 acres of undeveloped land to the New York State Park System. The other recognized the environmental stewardship of a Trump golf course in New Jersey operated by a well known manager, and cited Trump’s leadership in general terms. So Trump can firmly claim one personal award and one where his role and the accorded honor are more diffuse. By definition, two is plural, but the personal recognition of Trump is thin for the second one.

""The EPA director under Obama said the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions,"" Santorum said. ""That's what she said. Go look it up."" As if Santorum’s suggestion to ""look it up"" wasn’t enough of a prompt for us to take a look, a number of readers also suggested we analyze his statement. So we did. What was the Clean Power Plan? In August 2015, the Obama administration announced that its Clean Power Plan regulations would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. Scientists say that carbon emissions are a significant contributor to global climate change. Advocates added that the Clean Power Plan would also reduce other emissions that create soot and smog. However, after opponents sued the Obama administration and found some success in the courts, the plan was never implemented. Then, on March 28, President Donald Trump, as expected, issued an executive order that set in motion the plan’s dismantling. What was Santorum referring to? The primary piece of evidence for Santorum’s statement, according to Santorum spokesman Matt Beynon, was an exchange at a House Science Committee hearing on July 9, 2015, including questioning of Obama EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. Here’s the exchange: Smith: ""On the Clean Power Plan, former Obama Administration Assistant Secretary, Charles McConnell said it best, that it will reduce global temperature by only 1/100th of a degree Celsius. At the same time, it is going to increase the cost of electricity, that's going to hurt the lowest income Americans the most. How do you justify such an expensive burden, some -- rule that is really not going to do much good, and isn't this all pain and no gain?"" McCarthy: ""No sir. I don't agree with you. If you look at the RIA we did, the Regulatory Impact Analysis, you would see it's enormously beneficial. The value of this…"" Smith: ""Would you consider 1/100th of a degree to be enormously beneficial?"" McCarthy: ""The value of this rule is not measured in that way. It is measured in showing strong domestic action, which can actually trigger global action to address what is a…"" Smith: ""Do you disagree with my 1/100th of a degree figure? Do you disagree with my 1/100th of a degree?"" McCarthy: ""I’m not disagreeing that this action in and of itself will not make all the difference we need to address climate action. But what I'm saying is if (we) don't take action domestically, we will never get started."" Smith: ""But if you're looking at the results, the results can't justify the cost and the burden that you are imposing on the American people."" McCarthy: ""Actually this is a cost-beneficial rule…"" Did McCarthy say the rule would have ""no effect on man-made CO2 emissions""? First, we should point out that neither Smith nor McCarthy mentioned emissions per se in their exchange -- they discussed temperatures, a related but separate factor. Beyond that, though, McCarthy actually didn't say the plan would have ""no effect."" It would be more accurate to say McCarthy sidestepped the question. After McCarthy’s non-response to Smith’s question, the lawmaker didn’t follow up on that specific line of questioning. Because of McCarthy’s verbal fancy footwork, it’s a stretch for Santorum to say McCarthy acknowledged the view that the Clean Power Plan would have ""no effect"" on carbon emissions. In the meantime, Benyon provided some additional pieces of supporting evidence. However, they did not directly support Santorum’s statement. Benyon cited comments by an earlier EPA administrator under Obama, Lisa Jackson, at a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. At the hearing, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., showed Jackson a chart showing ""virtually no change"" in carbon dioxide and asked her if she agreed with it. Jackson responded, ""I believe that essential parts of the chart are that the U.S. acting alone will not impact the world's CO2 levels. But as we've all said, and as many members of this committee said, the race is on for us to enter into a clean energy future. There is technology in this country that can be used to move markets not only here, but abroad, and that means jobs for Americans that we are currently losing."" This is actually a stronger example of an Obama EPA administrator acknowledging the limitations of curbing carbon emissions. However, this hearing was held in 2009, long before the Clean Power Plan was unveiled. (In fact, in 2009, the Obama administration was pursuing legislation, not regulation, on carbon emissions.) Benyon also cited prepared testimony in 2016 by former Obama assistant energy secretary for fossil fuels Charles McConnell. ""What is also clear both scientifically and technically is that the EPA’s (Clean Power Plan) is not a plan that will significantly impact global CO2 emissions."" McConnell wrote. He cited calculations that the Clean Power Plan would reduce global temperatures by 0.01 degrees Fahrenheit and that the reduction in sea level rise would be only as wide as two human hairs. ""These are facts, and facts are stubborn things,"" he said. But again, Santorum wasn’t citing just any senior Obama administration official but specifically the head of the EPA. Does Santorum have a point anyway? Some researchers have expressed skepticism about the Clean Power Plan’s value. Benjamin Zycher of the conservative American Enterprise Institute and Patrick Michaels and Paul Knappenberger of the libertarian Cato Institute, have pointed to calculations using a model known as MAGICC, which EPA itself has used. The model suggests that the Clean Power Plan would reduce temperatures by small fractions of a degree, varying by the assumptions made. A wide range of climate scientists and policy experts we checked with offered some counterpoints. First, they said the United States needs to take its own steps to curb carbon production if the rest of the world is going to follow. ""Everyone acknowledges that the Clean Power Plan alone isn't enough to stop climate change, but that's a rather ridiculous bar to hold for a single regulation,"" said William Anderegg, a biologist at the University of Utah. ""What is clear, however, is that the Clean Power Plan is likely the single most critical piece of U.S. action to fulfill our commitments under the Paris Agreement."" Second, they argued that even a small reduction would be preferable to the upward trend line the world would likely see otherwise. ""Reducing the temperature of the atmosphere by 1/100th of a degree is in fact really significant,"" said Harold Wanless, who chairs the department of geological sciences at the University of Miami. ""We shot up several hundredths of a degree last year alone. Every hundredth of a degree cooled is a step in the right direction."" Finally, Santorum's perspective ""misses the thousands of lives per year we're already saving each year by cutting coal use,"" said Rob Jackson, a professor at the Stanford University School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences. And tallying up the impact of just the Clean Power Plan ignores other carbon-reduction policies pursued by the Obama administration, including higher vehicle fuel economy standards, regulations on other greenhouse gases such as methane, and heightened energy-efficiency requirements for buildings and appliances. Reasonable people can disagree about whether the costs on utilities, their employees and local economies justify such benefits. But focusing only on the global warming impact of the Clean Power Plan, as Santorum did, ignores these other considerations. Our ruling Santorum said, ""The EPA director under Obama said the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions. That's what she said. Go look it up."" Many scientists would acknowledge that the climate-change impact of U.S. action by itself would be modest. However, McCarthy didn’t actually say that, and few experts would peg the impact at zero, as Santorum did. We rate the statement False.

Greitens not quite right on right to work
","It took less than a month for Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens to fulfill one of his campaign promises. On Feb. 6, Greitens signed a law making Missouri the 28th right-to-work state, part of his strategy to improve the state’s economic climate. Two days later, in a Fox News interview with Neil Cavuto, the Republican governor touted the effects of the legislation, saying Missouri has joined the ranks of states that have seen a considerable amount of job growth. Greitens said in the interview: ""Over the past 25 years, job growth in right-to-work states has been twice as high as in non-right-to-work states. ... The facts are just so clear that this is going to lead to more jobs and higher pay for the people of Missouri."" Right-to-work laws prohibit union security agreements, which limit a union’s ability to require employees to join. These contracts can include mandatory fees as a condition of employment. Greitens signed the bill into law on Feb. 6. The law will take effect Aug. 28. Opponents of Missouri’s right-to-work law say it will allow workers declining to pay union fees to reap the benefits of unions, which are required by federal law to protect all workers covered by a contract. Supporters say it will encourage employers to move to the state, thereby creating more jobs. We wondered how Greitens arrived at the statistic that job growth has been growing at a much faster rate in right-to-work states and, furthermore, if there was truly a relationship between job growth and right-to-work laws. The numbers are more complicated Parker Briden, a spokesman for the Missouri governor’s office, directed us to a 2015 article from the Illinois Policy Institute, a conservative, nonprofit think tank in Chicago. The article’s author, Michael Lucci, reported that the job growth in right-to-work states from 1990-2015 was 47 percent, while job growth in non-right-to-work states was 21 percent during the same time period.   Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Lucci calculated the percent change for nonfarm job growth in each state over the time period and placed them into two groups — one right-to-work, the other non-right-to-work. Lucci did not adjust the job numbers for population. Aggregating job growth totals from right-to-work and non-right-to-work states is not as accurate as comparing growth in individual states, according to Gordon Lafer, an associate professor at the University of Oregon and a former senior labor policy adviser for the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Education and Labor.  Lafer has written in opposition of right-to-work laws. Lafer said the numbers are being driven by a few high job-growth states. ""I would fail a freshman in college for turning that in,"" he said. ""If Bill Gates walks into a bar, everyone there is a millionaire based on the average.""   An analysis of the data adjusted for population showed that of the eight states that saw more than 10 percent job growth from 1990 to 2015, six had right-to-work laws. On the other hand, a majority of the states that had a decrease in job growth were right-to-work states — nine out of 15. For what it’s worth, a comparison of the unemployment rate between the two groups of states suggests that there has been a smaller percentage of unemployed people in non-right-to-work states over the past few decades. Of the 10 states that had an increase of more than 10 percent in unemployment since 1990, half of those were right-to-work states. Four of the five states with the largest increases in unemployment were right-to-work states — Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina and South Carolina. But none of these numbers actually prove anything about the policy. Every state is governed by so many different factors affecting their economies that it’s difficult to pinpoint one policy as the economic driver using only Bureau of Labor Statistics data. ""You’re supposed to say, all other things being equal, what is the effect of this policy?"" Lafer said. ""Can you prove it’s right-to-work that’s causing it?"" Controlling for other factors, two case studies by researchers from the University of Nevada and Claremont McKenna College found mixed results on the economic effects of right-to-work. In a paper published in 2011, the authors wrote that Oklahoma’s right-to-work laws decreased private-sector union membership in the state but had no effect on job growth, per capita income and wages. Their case study on Idaho’s right-to-work laws found an increase in manufacturing jobs, but they had no effect on per capita income. What does affect job growth? What economists know for sure is that two main factors drive job growth — tax rates and education. Lafer said a policy like right-to-work might have been a larger incentive for companies in the 1940s and ’50s, but today the number of people in unions is so low that it doesn’t create the incentive it once did. He said companies today are more interested in moving to states with highly educated workforces, especially states with a large number of workers in STEM-related fields. Last year, 9.7 percent of Missourians were union members, lower than the U.S. average of 10.7 percent. Rik Hafer, a professor of economics in the Plaster School of Business & Entrepreneurship at Lindenwood University, said that it’s important to take many factors into consideration when thinking about whether a policy like right-to-work is actually linked to a state’s job growth. Factors like tourism, geography and culture can play a role in a company’s decision to move to a certain state. But more importantly, Hafer said, job growth is driven by an educated workforce and the individual and corporate taxes the company would face should it decide to move. A policy such as right-to-work might not be the make or break deal for Missouri jobs, but Hafer said it could ""increase the chances of gaining new jobs."" Right-to-work might play a more important role for cities that span the borders of two states, Hafer said. If a business could move just a few miles over to be in a state with a right-to-work law, it might choose to do so. Our Ruling Greitens said: ""Over the past 25 years, job growth in right to work states has been twice as high as in non-right to work states. ... The facts are just so clear that this is going to lead to more jobs and higher pay for the people of Missouri."" His information comes from a conservative think tank that had accurate numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics but used them in a way that experts say is unreliable for measuring the effect of a state law on its economy. Greitens used correct numbers but excluded important contextual information that might give someone a different impression of the figures. We rate this claim Half True. Correction: This story was corrected on April 6, 2017, to accurately describe the methodology used in the Illinois Policy Institute’s analysis of job growth in right-to-work and non-right-to-work states.

Were two people responsible for virtually all anti-Semitic incidents after the election?
","A segment hosted by CNN’s Don Lemon on May 18, 2017, got a little heated. Lemon and one of his guests, conservative radio host Dennis Prager, sparred over an apparent increase in anti-Semitic incidents after the 2016 presidential election, and who was to blame. Prager said there was no rise in anti-Semitic incidents, and the incidents that did occur didn’t have anything to do with Donald Trump. ""It was a 100 percent lie that his election unleashed anti-Semitism,"" Prager said. ""Hundreds of Jewish community centers had bomb threats called in. To the best of our knowledge to this day, 90 percent of them were called in by an American Jewish kid living in Israel, and the other 10 percent were a black radical who was trying to impress his girlfriend."" Is he correct? We found that Prager has a point about the bomb threats to Jewish community centers largely being the work of two suspects who have since been arrested. However, there is evidence that the number of anti-Semitic incidents other than bomb threats did increase after the election. (Prager did not respond to email inquiries.) The suspects To date, the FBI announced two arrests related to the bomb threats. (We should note that the two individuals cited below have not been tried yet.) The first came on March 3, when the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York announced a charge of cyberstalking against a St. Louis man, Juan Thompson. Thompson was charged with ""allegedly stalking a former romantic interest by, among other things, making bomb threats in her name to Jewish Community Centers and to the Anti-Defamation League."" The Justice Department said that Thompson appeared to have made ""at least eight of the JCC threats as part of a sustained campaign to harass and intimidate"" his victim. Prager was wrong that Thompson tried to impress a girlfriend; he is charged with trying to implicate an ex-girlfriend in crimes she didn’t commit. As for calling him a ""black radical,"" that’s a somewhat subjective. The Riverfront Times, a St. Louis newspaper, said that as a black journalist, Thompson had filed ""searing dispatches about injustices in Baltimore, Mississippi and Chicago. He relished the opportunity to strike back at what he calls an ‘oppressive, anti-black, racial supremacist, capitalist system’ that kneecaps all but the country's rich and white in the pursuit of basic civil rights and opportunities."" Then, on April 21, the Justice Department announced that charges had been filed against Michael Ron David Kadar, an 18-year-old resident of Israel with dual citizenship in the United States and Israel. The charges in question were for making telephone bomb threats against Jewish facilities in central Florida and for providing false information to police in Georgia. Then-FBI director James Comey said in a statement that ""this kind of behavior is not a prank, and it isn't harmless. It’s a federal crime. It scares innocent people, disrupts entire communities, and expends limited law enforcement resources."" So Prager’s on target when he cites Thompson and Kadar as the two individuals charged so far with making Jewish community center bomb threats. The bomb threats Somewhat less certain is the total number of threats called in to Jewish community centers. As we noted, officials have tied Thompson to eight calls. Meanwhile, the criminal complaint against Kadar alleged that between Jan. 4 and March 7, Kadar made ""at least 245 telephone calls involving bomb threats and active shooter threats. A significant portion of the threats targeted Jewish community centers and other historically Jewish institutions such as Jewish schools and Anti-Defamation League offices."" The FBI declined to comment further to PolitiFact, citing the ongoing investigation. So the exact number of threats the two individuals made -- once duplicate calls and calls made to non-Jewish targets are set aside -- is hard to nail down. However, the number of calls they made appears to be in the ballpark of the number of reported bomb threats. It’s not certain that threats numbered in the ""hundreds,"" as Prager said, but if not, they weren’t far off. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that tracks hate crimes, has tracked upwards of 170 such threats made internationally and domestically. And the Anti-Defamation League -- another group that tracks hate crimes, and which was a target of a number of the calls in question -- has identified 167 such threats in the United States in Canada. (The ADL’s tally did not count other countries, as the SPLC did.) Given this data, Prager has a point that most of the bomb threats are traceable to the two individuals who have been charged so far, and he’s also correct that Kadar has been charged with making many more than Thompson. Aryeh Tuchman, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, said that there are probably a modest number of bomb threats not traceable to either of these two suspects. ""The two individuals that Prager mentioned accounted for the vast majority of the bomb threats, but not all of them,"" Tuchman said. That said, Tuchman added one further piece of evidence that Thompson and Kadar account for the vast bulk of threats: ""Thankfully, there have been no further bomb threats recently,"" he said. Anti-Semitic incidents more broadly But if Prager has described the situation with the Jewish community center bomb threats with reasonable accuracy, he has engaged in a bit of cherry-picking by ignoring other signs of increased anti-Semitism after the election. ""Even if the bomb threats are discounted, we still saw an increase in anti-Semitic incidents in the first quarter of 2017,"" Tuchman said. ""Not including the bomb threats, there were 380 total incidents in the first quarter of 2017, up from 291 incidents in the first quarter of 2016. That’s an increase of 31 percent."" Incidents in 2016 cited by ADL include instances of harassment (such as voice mails or social media attacks), vandalism (such as graffiti) and assault (including one incident in which two shots were fired at a victim’s vehicle). Tuchman added that the number of incidents in December 2016 were almost 70 percent higher than the number of incidents in December 2015.  Tuchman cautioned that ADL ""believes that the presidential campaign was a factor in the increase in anti-Semitic incidents, but only one factor."" But even if the election was only one factor among many, the rise in anti-Semitic incidents overall call into question Prager’s assertion that it’s a ""100 percent lie that his election unleashed anti-Semitism."" Our ruling Prager said, ""It was a 100 percent lie that his election unleashed anti-Semitism. … Hundreds of Jewish community centers had bomb threats called in. To the best of our knowledge to this day, 90 percent of them were called in by an American Jewish kid living in Israel, and the other 10 percent were a black radical who was trying to impress his girlfriend."" He’s close to the mark in describing the overwhelming role of two suspects in making bomb threats against Jewish targets earlier this year. However, Prager ignores a documented rise in anti-Semitic incidents beyond bomb threats.

Is Jerry Brown 'diverting' 30 percent of California's new gas tax money?
","Drivers in California will start paying a higher gas tax this fall, as part of a bill signed by Gov. Jerry Brown to raise money for the state’s deteriorating roads and bridges. But when that tax hike kicks in, how much revenue will go to road projects? Republican State Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez claimed in a press release and on Twitter on May 11, 2017 that a large chunk will be siphoned off for anything but roads. ""Governor Brown and his fellow Democrats are already diverting funding to their own pet projects,"" she said in the press release. ""In this budget proposal, they are diverting 30 percent of funding from the gas tax to non-road related projects like building parks and job training for felons. That’s money from the very gas tax the Democrats promised would go solely to fixing our decrepit roads and providing relief for traffic congestion."" The gas tax increase is part of a larger transportation funding legislation signed by Brown in April 2017. In common speech, some politicians simply call this ""the gas tax."" It includes an initial 12 cent per gallon gas tax increase that starts in November; a diesel tax hike; and a new ""transportation improvement fee"" ranging from $25 to $175 per year, depending on the value of one’s vehicle. We wrote about how this new tax will affect the state's already high gas tax rate here and gas prices here.  It passed the Legislature with the help of Democrats and one Republican state senator. Melendez, who represents Riverside County, strongly opposed it. There’s no doubt roads are the main focus of the funding package. The measure was even called The Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017. We decided to examine two key parts of Melendez’s claim: Did Brown’s budget ‘divert’ 30 percent of the transportation funding? And was this money being siphoned off for ‘non-road’ related projects? We buckled up for a fact check. Our research Melendez’s spokesman Sam Spencer showed us a chart in the governor’s revised May budget that he said backs up the claim. It shows proposals for spending $2.8 billion of the new transportation revenue in the next fiscal year on various programs. Local streets and roads would get $445 million; bridges and culverts would receive $400 million and congested corridors would get $250 million. Spencer highlighted other categories he said ""are clearly not programs intended to fix our crumbling roads."" Those, Spencer said, include rail, transit, active transportation such as bikeways and pedestrian paths, parks and recreation, food and agriculture, university research and workforce development programs. Brown’s budget calls for spending $818.7 million on those. That’s about 29 percent of the overall $2.8 billion in new funding from the transportation package. It just about matches Melendez’s claim that 30 percent of the new revenue is being set aside for what appear to be non-road projects.  Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez's office said this chart from the governor's May budget backs up the claim. Response from Brown Administration We asked the governor’s staff about Melendez’s claim and about the categories that seem to have little to do with roads. Malcolm Dougherty, director of the California Department of Transportation, took issue with Melendez’s characterization that the budget ""diverts"" any money from its intended purpose. ""The dollars are being used exactly the way SB 1 presented them,"" Dougherty said, referring to the number of the Senate transportation funding bill that was signed into law. ""The funding package was always intended to include transit and rail."" Transit, rail and active transportation programs represent about one-quarter of the proposed new spending. Paul Golaszewski, who researches transportation funding at the nonpartisan California Legislative Analyst’s Office, agreed the governor’s budget ""adheres to SB1."" He also noted that in future years, the share of money devoted purely to road projects, increases under the state’s funding plans. Why parks and job training? But that still leaves the question of why parks, universities, workforce and farm programs are getting any gas tax money. And whether those categories have anything to do with road projects. Dougherty, the Caltrans director, said that before SB1 was signed, existing laws required some gas tax revenue go to state parks and food and agriculture programs. Parks collect a portion of the tax on gasoline sales for off-road vehicles using the parks. Likewise, Dougherty said, food and agriculture programs get a slice of gas tax revenue when farmers purchase fuel for their vehicles, also under an existing law. Both laws remain in place after SB1. Dougherty added that the revenue for the parks and workforce training, the two categories cited by Melendez in her statement, represent less than 3 percent of the transportation revenue. The University of California and California State University systems will get a combined $7 million of the new revenue for what Dougherty called ""transportation related research."" Finally, he said, the state’s workforce development board will get $5 million to prepare workers for jobs created by the transportation spending. Melendez’s spokesman pointed to a state workforce board budget document that proposes using that money for ""pre-apprenticeship training programs, focused on formerly incarcerated, women and minorities."" SB 1 calls for the workforce board to create those programs. It also authorized the money for the universities. Our ruling California state Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez recently claimed Gov. Jerry Brown’s budget is ""diverting 30 percent of funding from the gas tax to non-road related projects like building parks and job training for felons."" There’s some truth to her claim: The governor’s May budget shows about 30 percent of the revenue from this transportation measure goes to categories that won’t directly improve roads for cars and trucks, as dictated by the law Brown signed in April. Most of that 30 percent goes to bicycle, transit and rail projects. Melendez, however, cherry-picked two programs -- parks and workforce training -- that represent less than 3 percent of the overall funding. Melendez’s statement also ignores the fact that roads will see an increased share of the overall funding in future years. Additionally, it’s misleading and simply not accurate for Melendez to say this money is being ‘diverted’ when Brown’s budget proposes to spend the money exactly as outlined in the bill he signed and the Legislature passed a month earlier. There should be no surprise, at this point, that the measure required funding for transit programs, railways and bicycle and pedestrian paths. The smaller spending on parks, universities and workforce development may raise eyebrows, but was also authorized by SB 1. Melendez’s overall statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate her claim Mostly False.

Mostly False: Democrat says Paul Manafort visited Moscow during campaign
","The Justice Department’s appointment of a special counsel to probe Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election and any possible Russia-Trump campaign connection reaffirmed the belief of Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., that impeachment is in the offing. Waters is confident that the special counsel and the congressional investigations will uncover proof of collusion. ""I really do believe that much of what you saw coming out of Trump's mouth was a play from Putin's playbook,"" Waters said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe May 18. ""I think you can see visits, you know, to Moscow made during the campaign by (Paul) Manafort and others."" Waters went as far as to say that the ""lock her up"" chant aimed at Hillary Clinton was ""developed strategically with people from the Kremlin, with Putin."" While we have reported on the ties of Manafort -- Trump’s former campaign chairman -- to Russian interests, we wondered about Waters’ claim that he and others visited Moscow during the campaign. We found one clear example. There is no public record that Manafort went at all. Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page did go to Moscow in July 2016. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn also went to Moscow, but at a time when he wasn't part of Trump's team. The Center for American Progress, a Democratic policy group, has a webpage it calls the Moscow Project where it compiles information on ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The Democratic group lists no travel to Moscow by Manafort. Trump named Manafort to manage the Republican National Convention and by May 2016 elevated him to campaign chairman. Manafort stepped down in mid August. Manafort had dealings with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Ukrainian operative with reported ties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik came to the United States twice during the campaign, but so far as we could tell, Manafort didn’t reciprocate with a trip of his own. The travels of Page provide the clearest support for Waters’ statement. Page founded an investment company with business in Russia. In March 2016, Trump mentioned Page as one of a group of advisers on foreign policy. In July, Page went to Moscow and spoke at a university graduation. After the election, he went to Moscow again. Page called the suggestion that he was a back channel between the campaign and the Russians a ""witch hunt."" The only other publicly known trip to Russia’s capital by a Trump insider was Flynn’s visit in December 2015 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of RT (Russia Today), a government media operation. Flynn reportedly was paid for giving a speech at the event. According to one account, Flynn went to Trump Tower at some point in the fall of 2015 to advise Trump on the Islamic State and Iran. In February 2016, he was reported to be someone Trump turned to on foreign policy. Flynn said he was advising multiple candidates at the time. It took until June before Flynn was openly praising Trump over Clinton. We reached out to Waters’office and did not hear back. Waters said that Manafort and others with ties to the Trump campaign went to Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign. From what’s on the public record, Manafort didn’t go at all, and Page went once. Flynn went after Trump announced, but before there is any report of a strong and exclusive tie to the candidate. The various investigations underway might resolve whether there was collusion, but the travel itineraries of Trump’s associates don’t appear to be fertile ground at this point. Waters made it sound like this was a regular occurrence. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/may/19/maxine-waters/rep-waters-exaggerates-trump-associate-moscow-trip/

Paul Ryan's claim on Wisconsin being a model for covering people with preexisting conditions
","The Affordable Care Act put an end to insurance companies charging higher health insurance premiums to people for having a pre-existing condition. But the Republican replacement for Obamacare would make that practice possible again. GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan says not to worry, just look at how his home state of Wisconsin took care of people with pre-existing conditions before Obamacare. So let’s see what case he's making. The claim On May 7, 2017, three days after the House of Representatives narrowly approved the Obamacare replacement, Ryan appeared on ABC’s ""This Week."" He said that under the bill, labeled ""Trumpcare"" by some Democrats, states could ask for a waiver from the federal government that would allow insurance companies to charge higher rates for a pre-existing condition for people who had a lapse in health insurance coverage. But those higher premiums could be charged only if states also established a so-called high-risk pool or provided some other type of financial assistance that would help those people buy insurance. Ryan held up the Badger State as a model for how things could work under the GOP bill, saying: In Wisconsin, we had a really successful high-risk pool. Ten percent of the people in the individual market in Wisconsin were in the state high-risk pool. They had eight or nine plans to choose from. They could go to any doctor or any hospital they wanted. And their premiums and co-pays were cheaper than they are under Obamacare today. We'll check Ryan’s three-part claim, which he repeated on the Fox News Channel. He’s essentially on target on the first two parts, but not on the third. What’s a high-risk pool? The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation helps explain the rationale for creating high-risk pools: the sickest 10 percent of the population accounts for nearly two-thirds of all health spending. But questions remain about the effectiveness of high-risk pools and whether there would be enough public dollars allocated to them under the GOP bill to make insurance affordable for people with preexisting conditions. Wisconsin’s high-risk pool ""was a lifesaver"" for those it served, Kaiser health reform and private insurance senior fellow Karen Pollitz told us. But it served only some of the people who were eligible, and for it to be viable nationally, ""you would have to put down a whole lot of money, more than has been put in the House bill so far,"" she said.   Wisconsin’s high-risk pool -- the Wisconsin Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan -- operated from 1979 through 2013. It was funded through policyholder premiums, reduced payments to health care providers and financial assessments on health insurance companies. At the end, it insured 21,000 people and was regarded as among the most successful programs in the country, even though not everyone with preexisting conditions who needed coverage could afford it. Also, Wisconsin’s high-risk pool did not contain the same coverages as Obamacare plans -- for example, it had a lifetime limit for benefits, whereas Obamacare does not. So, understanding the limited nature of Wisconsin’s high-risk pool, we go to the three parts of Ryan’s claim. Ryan’s claim Ryan was close on the number of plans available in Wisconsin’s high-risk pool. There were seven options (not eight or nine) in place with deductibles ranging from $1,000 to $7,500, although one was only for Medicare recipients seeking supplemental coverage. Ryan also was close on provider availability. All hospitals and doctors who were Medicaid-certified could be used by high-risk pool recipients. That included all hospitals in the state and the vast majority of doctors, said Sam Austin, a health policy analyst at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Population Health Institute and the author of a 2013 Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau report on the state’s high-risk pool. Finally, Ryan’s staff pointed out that Wisconsin’s deputy insurance commissioner has told Congress that people in the high-risk pool had to pay more for coverage under Obamacare. But it can’t be flatly stated that all premiums and co-payments in the high-risk pool were lower than those under Obamacare, Austin and other experts told us. As we noted, under options available in the high-risk pool and under Obamacare, premiums, deductibles, coverages and subsidies all vary. Kaiser’s Pollitz told us that if medical inflation were taken into account, the Wisconsin high-risk pool costs would generally be higher than the current Obamacare rates. And high-risk pools expert Jean Hall, a Kansas University health policy professor, told us that low-income people who qualify for subsidies under Obamacare are getting more coverage for less money than they were with Wisconsin’s high-risk pool -- even if there were cases where people with higher incomes got a better deal with the pool. Our rating Ryan says that before Obamacare, Wisconsin’s high-risk pool for health insurance ""had eight or nine"" plans to choose from, people ""could go to any doctor or any hospital they wanted, and their premiums and co-pays were cheaper than they are under Obamacare today."" The House speaker slightly overstates the number of plans and the availability of providers, but is generally on target. But it can’t be flatly stated that the high-risk pool plans were cheaper than Obamacare plans for comparable coverage.

Ted Cruz partly right that first Congress required every able man to own a musket
","To whoops and applause, Ted Cruz told National Rifle Association members there was a time that Congress required men to own guns. In his April 28, 2017, speech, which the association live-streamed on Facebook, the Texas Republican pointed out that muskets were vital in American revolutionary times and ""what everybody carried into combat."" ""Anyone know the first gun control laws in the United States?"" Cruz went on. ""The first Congress passed a law mandating that every able-bodied man must own a musket.

Congressional historian, records After unsuccessfully seeking Cruz’s historical backup, we turned to a George Washington University historian, Kenneth Russell Bowling, who told us by phone he was fresh off contributing to the publication of 22 volumes of papers related to the earliest years of Congress. Bowling said Cruz was likely reflecting on a measure passed into law by the nation’s second Congress in 1792. To get a fix on that, Bowling suggested that we consult record-keepers at the Library of Congress where, by email, a librarian who went unidentified pointed us to documentation of the Second Militia Act of 1792, approved by Congress on May 8, 1792 — six days after passage of the Militia Act of 1792 (which was repealed in 1795) giving the president authority to call out state militias to repel U.S. invasions and to do so in the case of state insurrections at the request of state officials or on approval of a federal district judge or an associate justice of the Supreme Court. The second act required ""each and every free able-bodied white male citizen"" aged 18 through 44 to enroll in his state militia within the next year with the exception of the vice president, other federally elected officials and specified workers such as  ""all ferrymen employed at any ferry on the post road"" as well as individuals exempted by state laws.

Per Cruz’s claim, the law said every enrolled man ""shall within six months thereafter, provide himself with a good musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints and a knapsack, a pouch with a box therein to contain not less than twenty-four cartridges, suited to the bore of his musket or firelock, each cartridge to contain a proper quantity of powder and ball...""          SOURCE: Website, ""A Century of Lawmaking: for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875,"" Statutes at Large, 2nd Congress, 1st Session, Library of Congress (accessed May 16, 2017) Our ruling Cruz said: ""The first Congress passed a law mandating that every able-bodied man must own a musket.""

Brad Schimel falsely claims there is no ‘backlog’ of untested rape kits in Wisconsin
","Thousands of rape kits collected in Wisconsin in recent decades are now scheduled to be tested as officials seek to identify serial rapists or find leads on unsolved crimes. Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel has agreed the work needs to be done, but he has repeatedly contested the description in news reports that the untested kits comprise a ""backlog."" He argues the term unfairly casts his agency in a negative light. ""I do disagree with the term backlog because the Wisconsin crime lab is up to date with all current, pending investigations,"" Schimel said April 9, 2017 on Up Front with Mike Gousha. ""It’s not a backlog. These are things no one ever asked the state crime lab to test."" Is Schimel — a Republican who is up for reelection in 2018 — right to claim the untested kits are not a ""backlog""? The background Rape kits have accumulated over decades in police evidence rooms and hospital storage areas — both in Wisconsin and nationwide. A July 2015 USA TODAY Network investigation revealed that 70,000 rape kits were untested nationally. In Wisconsin, the figure was about 6,000. They include cases where victims choose not to pursue charges, defendants confessed or the issue was consent rather than identity, Schimel said in the Up Front interview. But, he said, authorities have realized in recent years the value in going back and testing those cases, since sex offenders typically have more than one victim. ""If you test that DNA, you might link that defendant to another unsolved case out there,"" Schimel said. ""So we’ve recognized the need to go back and look at these, but it’s not a backlog."" The state Justice Department determined 3,800 of the untested kits would be tested, though only if the rape survivor consents. But the process hasn’t moved quickly. In September 2015, the department received a $4 million grant to begin testing, but it didn’t have the capacity to handle that volume in house. Instead, the private lab Bode Cellmark Forensics was hired to run the tests. The lab can process about 200 kits per month, said department spokesman Johnny Koremenos. But it will take about two years to test all the kits, based on figures DOJ provided. About 800 kits have been sent to Bode so far, and the testing process can take as long as six months for a single kit. In February 2017, Schimel said ""a few hundred"" kits had been tested, but his office acknowledged days later that only nine had been completed. Koremenos said as of early May the state crime lab had completed testing on 13 kits, and Bode Cellmark had completed 50, though DOJ was awaiting the ""formal results."" Backlogs have been an issue at DOJ before. The crime lab it oversees fell far behind as DNA testing exploded in frequency in the mid-2000s, with 1,800 cases on crime lab shelves awaiting testing in 2007 when Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen took office. He hired 31 additional analysts and declared in 2010 that the backlog had been eliminated. Schimel has emphasized the state crime lab has kept up with testing new sexual assault evidence under his watch and rape kits didn’t become viewed as uncompleted work until state authorities shifted their perspective of it recently. Schimel disagreeing with himself Schimel’s claim that the word ""backlog"" is inaccurate runs into trouble when compared with, well, his own past statements. A May 2015 letter from Schimel accompanying a federal grant application referred to ""the state’s backlog of unsubmitted sexual assault kits."" An identically worded letter seeking a similar grant in April 2016 used the phrase again, though the letter was signed that time by Bonnie Cyganek, a DOJ administrator. That word choice is in line with the definitions used by popular dictionaries. Oxford says backlog describes ""an accumulation of uncompleted work or matters needing to be dealt with,"" and Merriam-Webster says it is ""an accumulation of tasks unperformed or materials not processed."" Dictionary.com uses the definition of ""a reserve or accumulation, as of stock, work, or business."" It says the word originally described a large log placed at the back of a fire in the late 1600s and evolved over the next two centuries to figuratively mean ""something stored up for later use."" Now, however, Schimel and his spokesman are saying that word is not appropriate. Koremenos said the term implies DOJ is to blame for the untested rape kits when ""this is not a DOJ shortcoming."" Our rating Schimel says it is wrong to describe the untested rape kits as a ""backlog,"" arguing it implies blame on the department under his watch. But the definition of the term does not involve how or when a backlog began. The department has decided that the work should be done — a process that began slowly and is on pace to stretch out for up to two years, based on the current capacity and pace. That’s a large accumulation of uncompleted work. And that’s the definition of a backlog. The fact that Schimel himself previously used the term makes his claim not only wrong but ridiculous. We rate Schimel’s claim Pants on Fire.

Rush Limbaugh says like Donald Trump, Barack Obama also meddled in an FBI investigation
","Amid accusations that President Donald Trump may have obstructed justice, conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh said President Barack Obama did the exact same thing. The New York Times and others have reported that back in February, Trump took FBI director James Comey aside and asked him to scale back the FBI’s investigation into former White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and payments he received from foreign countries. Trump fired Comey several weeks later. Limbaugh said Obama took similar action during the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Other conservative outlets have mirrored this point. ""What Trump is alleged to have done is actually no different than what Barack Obama did in April last year when he made it known that he didn’t want Hillary prosecuted,"" Limbaugh said on his show May 17. ""In fact, the Obama situation is actually worse."" We reached out to Limbaugh but did not hear back. Limbaugh is likely referring to an interview Obama gave to Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace in April 2016. During the interview, Obama briefly discussed the ongoing FBI probe into Clinton’s email use. Here is the key exchange between Obama and Wallace (read the full transcript here):   Wallace: ""Can you still say flatly that she did not jeopardize America’s secrets?"" Obama: ""I’ve got to be careful because, as you know, there have been investigations, there are hearings, Congress is looking at this. And I haven’t been sorting through each and every aspect of this.   ""Here’s what I know: Hillary Clinton was an outstanding secretary of state. She would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy. … ""I continue to believe that she has not jeopardized America’s national security. Now what I’ve also said is that — and she has acknowledged — that there’s a carelessness, in terms of managing emails, that she has owned, and she recognizes. ""But I also think it is important to keep this in perspective. This is somebody who has served her country for four years as secretary of state, and did an outstanding job. And no one has suggested that in some ways, as a consequence of how she’s handled emails, that that detracted from her excellent ability to carry out her duties."" This interview and Trump’s private conversation with Comey are not the same. Obama, speaking in a public setting, said he believed Clinton ""has not jeopardized America’s national security."" But he never said outright that the FBI should end its investigation, nor did he say Clinton was innocent. In fact, Obama acknowledged the ongoing FBI investigation. In contrast, reports by the New York Times and others say Trump told the director of the FBI, explicitly and directly, what he hoped he would do regarding an ongoing investigation. According to the reports about Comey’s memo of the private White House conversation with Trump, Trump said, ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.""  For the record, the White House denies the reports. There are clear differences between the situations.  ""Obama was speaking to the press and expressing his confidence in the integrity of Secretary Clinton, which is not the same thing as asking the director of the FBI not to pursue an investigation,"" said Rebecca Lonergan, a University of Southern California law professor and former public corruption prosecutor. A reasonable person could critique Obama for offering his opinion on an ongoing investigation instead of saying ""no comment."" Indeed, some legal commentators and conservative pundits accused Obama at the time of subtly putting his thumb on the scale. But legal scholars’ reaction to Trump’s reported actions has been much more robust. Trump’s private meeting with Comey, coupled with Trump’s decision to fire him, raises legitimate questions of impropriety. Peter Henning, a Wayne State University law professor and white collar crime expert, said he isn’t convinced that Trump’s actions count as obstruction of justice. (Obstruction of justice, presidential immunity, impeachment: What you need to know) But Obama’s remarks — delivered in a public setting without addressing a particular agent, witness or other involved party — are much less significant, he said. ""The difference between them is (that Trump’s actions are) probably enough to initiate an investigation,"" Henning said. Limbaugh’s assertion misses another obvious point: Trump has gone beyond what Obama said about Clinton’s ongoing investigation. Trump has repeatedly defended Flynn in media interviews and on Twitter, without expressing caution about ongoing probes. ""Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!"" he tweeted March 31. Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion! ""Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation,"" he said in a Feb. 16 press conference. ""He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given. He didn't have to do that because what he did wasn't wrong."" Limbaugh said, ""What Trump is alleged to have done is actually no different than what Barack Obama did in April last year when he made it known that he didn’t want Hillary prosecuted."" Obama did say that he didn’t believe Clinton harmed national security amid an ongoing FBI investigation into her email setup. But he never said she was innocent of all crimes, nor did he say the FBI should drop its investigation. And he made these remarks in an on-camera news interview, during which he made a point to distance himself from the investigation. Trump’s situation is different: In a secret, one-on-one conversation, Trump explicitly told Comey that he hoped the FBI would back off from its Flynn investigation, according to reports. It may not have been an order, nor a clear example of obstruction of justice, but the exchange raises red flags. Limbaugh’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/may/18/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-donald-trump-barack-obama-also-/

Did federal inmate population drop under Obama for first time since Carter?
","Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently charged federal prosecutors with taking a more aggressive approach to charging defendants, including seeking mandatory minimum sentences. The guidelines, signed on May 10, 2017, moved in a very different direction from what the Department of Justice had been doing under President Barack Obama. Under Obama, the department focused on prosecuting the most serious criminals and finding ways to keep minor or low-level offenders from serving long, mandatory sentences. During a May 18 floor speech, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., made clear that he thought Sessions’ new guidelines were ill-advised. ""Thanks in part to this initiative, President Obama became the first president since (Jimmy) Carter to leave the White House with a smaller federal prison population than when he took office,"" Schumer said. We wondered if that comparison was correct. When we checked with Schumer’s office, a spokesman pointed us to research by the Pew Research Center, a widely trusted independent source. Pew looked at federal Bureau of Prisons data going back to the 1920s and produced this graph showing a sharply increasing federal prison population between about 1980 and 2010. The graph shows that not only was Obama the first president to see a drop in the federal prison population since Carter, but that only four other presidents (Johnson, Kennedy, Truman and Hoover) oversaw a decline on their watch. Most of the presidents studied -- nine, starting with Coolidge and ending with George W. Bush -- oversaw inmate increases on their watch. We wondered whether Schumer was cherry-picking data from the much smaller pool of federal inmates. In 2015, the number of inmates in state-run prisons was almost seven times larger than the number of federal inmates, and the total number of inmates in state and local facilities was more than than 10 times larger than the number in federal custody. However, we found that the same trends held for state and local inmate populations -- the number declined under Obama for the first time since at least the Carter years. Here are the trend lines for state inmates (dark blue) and local inmates (lighter blue), which we compiled from federal prison statistics: Meanwhile, a credible argument can be made that Obama’s policies made a difference in driving the decline. As we’ve reported, Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 into law. It dramatically reduced a 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine. And his administration advocated for, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission approved, the retroactive application of some of the new sentencing guidelines. Ironically, Sessions was among a number of Senate Republicans who spoke in favor of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. ""I will not favor alterations that massively undercut the sentencing we have in place, but I definitely believe that the current system is not fair and that we are not able to defend the sentences that are required to be imposed under the law today,"" he said in a 2009 Senate speech about the bill. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, said he sees no significant omissions from Schumer’s statement. ""The assertion is correct,"" Fox said. ""The reasons are partly strategic and partly being in the right office at the right time. ""During Obama's administration, prosecutors were discouraged from seeking unnecessarily long prison sentences for non-violent drug offenders, a practice that the Trump administration wants to change. In addition, the cumulative impact of a declining crime rate had an impact on prison populations."" Our ruling Schumer said, ""President Obama became the first president since Carter to leave the White House with a smaller federal prison population than when he took office."" The statistics bear out Schumer’s assertion, so we rate it True.",/factchecks/2017/may/18/charles-schumer/did-federal-inmate-population-drop-under-obama-fir/

Torching Greg Abbott's claim Travis County sheriff declared she wouldn't hold violent criminals
","Greg Abbott gave a backhanded howdy (or the back of his hand) to a Democratic sheriff in May 2017 before he approved the Republican-driven proposal intended to keep local communities from shielding unauthorized immigrants from deportation. The governor explained his support of Senate Bill 4 during what may have been the planet's first exclusively Facebook Live signing of legislation into law: ""This law cracks down on policies like the Travis County sheriff who declared that she would not detain known criminals accused of violent crimes. Those policies are sanctuary city policies and won’t be tolerated in Texas. Elected officials and law enforcement agencies, they don’t get to pick and choose which laws they will obey."" Three days earlier, the referenced sheriff, Sally Hernandez, issued a statement suggesting that while SB 4 wouldn’t enhance public safety, she'd go along: ""While I hate seeing a state law like this come to pass,"" Hernandez said, ""I have always followed the law and that will not change."" We previously found False an Abbott claim that Hernandez was refusing to enforce a federal law regarding communication about jailed immigrants. The sheriff's published policy declares otherwise. Still, did Hernandez declare that she wouldn’t detain known criminals accused of violent crimes, as Abbott said? Abbott offers no backup We asked Abbott’s office for the basis of his fresher claim and didn’t hear back. You could read the governor to have said that Hernandez, who was sworn in as sheriff in January 2017, put in place rules against keeping convicts accused of violent crimes behind bars — a broad unsupported charge given that the county continues to prosecute crimes of all kinds. But in the context of Abbott's mention of ""sanctuary city policies,"" he surely was referring to Hernandez’s announced policy, effective Feb. 1, 2017, that the county would no longer automatically grant requests by federal authorities to ""detain"" specified suspects for up to 48 hours so agents could investigate and possibly hasten deportation. Hernandez, in her January 2017 announcement of the policy, said the department would honor ICE detainer requests only if an inmate was charged with or convicted of capital murder, murder, aggravated sexual assault or human smuggling — or if federal agents obtained a court order or arrest warrant for a suspect. Otherwise, inmates would be able to post bail and be released, no matter their immigration status. Hernandez said before the policy took effect: ""Our community is safer when people can report crimes without fear of deportation. I trust the court system and our judges to assess the risks and set appropriate bonds and conditions for all who are incarcerated."" Policy says… Let’s look at the wording of the policy, then gauge whether, as Abbott said, Hernandez was saying she wouldn’t detain known criminals charged with violent acts. The policy states the sheriff’s office ""shall comply with ICE detainer requests under the following circumstances: (a) when the detainer request is accompanied by a judicial warrant or court order for continued detention or notification, to the extent required by the judicial warrant or court order; or (b) when the individual who is the subject of the ICE detainer is charged with or has been convicted of the following felonies under Texas law: (1) Capital Murder, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 19.03; (2) Murder -- First Degree, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 19.02; (3) Aggravated Sexual Assault, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 22.021, and (4) Continuous Smuggling of Persons, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 20.06."" Separately, we noticed, the policy leaves wiggle room for the sheriff to hold inmates facing other charges. A portion states the office ""reserves the right to exercise discretion in any individual case to ensure that justice is served."" Policy in practice When we asked the sheriff’s office about Abbott’s claim, spokeswoman Kristen Dark said by email that no inmates placed in the Travis County Jail ""will be released without making bond or having his or her charges disposed by a judge."" Abbott’s description of the sheriff’s detainer policy, Dark wrote, wasn’t accurate because the policy provides for detainers to be granted automatically for several violent crimes and also gives the office discretion to ""ensure that justice is served."" Dark wrote: ""In each and every case,"" the office’s ""command staff reviews an inmate’s current charge/s as well as criminal history. If there is any indication of violence in that data, the ICE Detainer Request is honored,"" she said. A spreadsheet We asked Dark if the agency had recently analyzed when jail personnel approved or rejected ICE detainer requests. In reply, Dark emailed us a spreadsheet, covering department decisions from March 1, 2017 through May 5, 2017, which she described as its May 5, 2017, response to an open-records request by KUT News. The sheet doesn’t show past convictions for any crimes, so we didn’t see a way to reach conclusions about individuals not being detained despite their criminal histories. But what about letting individuals go despite current violent-crime charges? Over the two-plus months, according to the sheet, ICE detainer requests were approved by the department for around 200 individuals charged with crimes, with many individuals listed as remaining in jail. Charges filed against the detainer-approved individuals include sexual abuse of a child; manslaughter; aggravated sexual assault; and driving while intoxicated, according to the sheet. The sheet identifies 15 individuals already released to ICE in response to detainer requests. Related charges include DWI; assault causing bodily injury; aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (two men); terroristic threat of a family member; manufacture of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver; possession of marijuana; burglary of a habitation; sexual indecency with a child; and aggravated sexual assault of a child.   On the flip side, the sheet lists about 90 individuals mostly released by the county after detainer requests were denied. Many of the people were arrested for allegedly driving while intoxicated or possessing small amounts of marijuana, neither of which would necessarily signal a violent crime. We counted nine individuals among the 90 who were each arrested for an alleged assault causing bodily injury to a family member--domestic violence, Dark told us by phone. Eight of these inmates were released on personal recognizance bonds, the sheet states, after the sheriff declined to approve a detainer requested by ICE; the ninth was released by a judge’s order, the sheet says. We asked Dark about the rationale for declining detainers on those individuals. By email, Dark replied: ""The nature of the behavior that resulted in the arrests was not aggravated and therefore, did not meet the threshold required for"" the office to automatically ""honor the ICE detainer request."" Dark said by phone that further research revealed that five of the individuals had previously been released to ICE, possibly even deported. Dark’s email said: ""If ICE has past experience with the individuals, they should know the status and be able to quickly get a warrant or court order. If presented with a warrant,"" the sheriff’s office ""would gladly have turned these inmates over to ICE upon the disposition of their charges by a judge,"" Dark said. The sheet shows too that a man who allegedly made a terroristic threat was released on a personal recognizance bond after the sheriff denied a detainer request. Dark said by email the individual had allegedly told a security guard at a bar, ""I’m going to shoot you."" Dark said no weapon was found in his possession. Our ruling Abbott said Hernandez ""declared that she would not detain known criminals accused of violent crimes."" That’s a distortion of Hernandez’s statements and her announced policy. The sheriff made it clear she wouldn’t automatically honor all requests to hold suspects for ICE. But the policy specifies several violent crimes for which the department directly grants the hold requests and it reserves the office’s right to exercise discretion in the interests of justice. Abbott, a seasoned judge and former state attorney general, should know better. We find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

No, thousands of dead people are not registered to vote in North Carolina
","A chain email has begun circulating in North Carolina that claims widespread irregularities in the state’s voter rolls.   The email caught our attention with its subject line, ""PROOF !! North Carolina has the world's oldest voters !"" It says there are thousands of registered voters in North Carolina who are 110 or more years old, including one person who is a whopping 219 years old. Though tongue-in-cheek, the implication is clear – that many dead people are still actively registered, perhaps allowing others to commit voter fraud by casting ballots in their names. ""Perhaps it is something in the (North) Carolina water,"" the email begins. ""I doubt there is another state in the Union who could claim, as NC does, to have 5,376 voters 110 years old, or older. One current voter was born in 1798, making him a rather hefty 219 years old, thereby  nearly doubling the age of the oldest person on earth."" If all this is true, it would clearly indicate some concerning irregularities. The Gerontology Research Group, which tracks the oldest living people, has been able to verify only 43 people in the entire world age 110 or older as of May 3. The email concludes that this is ""more evidence that when you think of questionable elections, (North) Carolina should be the FIRST state that comes to mind."" So we wanted to get to the bottom of which is fraudulent – this email, or the state’s voter rolls. Following the president’s lead? The chain email began making the rounds, it appears, shortly after President Donald Trump announced a new committee on May 11 to look into voter fraud around the country. Trump has consistently spread false claims about voter fraud, both during his presidential campaign and after winning the election. He said ""millions"" of people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton and that he should’ve won the popular vote, which PolitiFact ruled Pants On Fire. In reality, studies have consistently shown that voter fraud is incredibly rare. Trump has also made unfounded accusations of widespread voter fraud against several individual states – all of which have been rated Pants On Fire – including North Carolina, California, New Hampshire and Virginia. Those claims are either vague about the type of fraud or refer specifically to immigrants voting illegally. None have claimed what this new chain email alleges, that dead people are somehow voting. In years past, versions of this claim have been popular on conservative and right-wing websites, internet forums and blogs – including Breitbart and the North Carolina-based Civitas Institute. Why so many ancient voters? The chain email’s most eye-popping claim is about that 219-year-old voter. It’s also the first mistake the email makes. It refers to that person as a male, but a list of voters included in the email clearly shows he is really a she. There’s more intrigue: In 2012, when Breitbart wrote about super-old voters in North Carolina, it didn’t mention anyone over 200. We wondered if this woman only recently decided – nearly a century since being eligible to vote – that now was the time to finally register. So we asked Pat Gannon, the spokesman for the North Carolina State Board of Elections. He said the state database does appear to show 5,391 people over 110 – a few more than the email mentioned, even – but that there are several honest explanations. For the 219-year-old, he said, it amounts to just plain human error when a clerk was entering the person’s information. ""The ‘219-year-old’ voter was inadvertently given a birth date of 1797 instead of 1979, according to our research,"" Gannon wrote in an email. ""We’ve also determined that the voters that show up as 118, 120 and 154 years old do so because of data entry errors. Their dates of birth will soon be corrected in our database."" But that only covers four out of 5,391. What about the rest? Nearly all of them – 97.5 percent – are what the state calls ""legacy voters."" Until the 1990s, people who registered to vote in North Carolina didn't have to list their date of birth. They only had to promise they were at least 18. Then, in the late 2000s, the state digitized its voter records. Gannon said anyone who was in the system with no date of birth was automatically listed as being born Jan. 1 in either 1900 or 1901. Of the 5,391 voters who appear over 110 in the database, he said, 5,257 fall into that category. As for the other 130 questionable voters (2.4 percent of the total), Gannon said, some could still be alive, could be dead, or could be listed due to clerical errors like the four they’ve already identified. Most North Carolina voters who die are automatically removed from voter rolls, since they die in North Carolina or another state that shares its records with North Carolina. But Gannon said some states don’t share their records, including South Carolina and Virginia, the two states with the longest borders with North Carolina. Any North Carolina voters who die in one of those states won’t have their registrations revoked until either a family member notifies the state or eight years go by without that person voting. And while it’s possible there are dead people on the voter rolls, people committing fraud by voting in their names is almost unheard of. In the 2016 general election, two people in North Carolina were caught voting for dead family members, out of 4.8 million voters statewide who cast a ballot, according to a previous audit by the elections board. Our ruling After President Donald Trump announced a new commission on voter fraud, a chain email has been making the rounds in North Carolina suggesting voter fraud and ""questionable elections."" It cites thousands of people registered to vote who couldn’t possibly be alive. However, nearly 98 percent of those people are actually voters who the state lists as being born in 1900 or 1901 since they didn’t have to give their date of birth when registering to vote. Others are on the list simply due to clerical errors. Of these nearly 5,400 voters who appear 110 or older, no more than 130 are dead. And it could be less. A 2016 audit found only two cases of people voting in the name of a dead person, out of more than 4.8 million votes cast. The email reaches a faulty conclusion based on a dishonest premise, and we rate its claim False. Correction: An earlier version of this article said inactive voters have their registrations automatically revoked after 16 years. It's actually after eight years. This did not affect our ruling.",/factchecks/2017/may/18/chain-email/no-thousands-dead-people-are-not-registered-vote-n/

Yes, indoor air pollution kills more than HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB
","Emphasizing the need to bring clean fuel to the world’s poor, James Rockall, CEO of the World LPG Association, recently said that ""more (people) die of indoor air pollution than malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis combined."" Rockall’s statement showed up in a tweet from Stanford Energy, a research group at Stanford University, after he spoke there May 9. Rockall confirmed that he did make this claim, and we decided to check it out. Public health researchers have known for some time that in many poorer nations, fumes from dirty cooking stoves pose a health threat. Rockall’s group represents the interests of the liquified petroleum gas industry, but that self-interest aside, there’s no question that gas burns more cleanly than wood or coal. Rockall told us he got his numbers from the World Health Organization. He took a 2016 report on deaths from indoor air pollution and compared that to 2015 estimates of death from HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The indoor air pollution deaths, however, were based on 2012 data. To keep the comparison fair, we looked at 2012 mortality estimates for HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. We consulted three different sources -- UNAIDS, WHO and the Global Burden of Disease Study -- and used the highest available estimate. Here’s what the numbers show:   Deaths in 2012 HIV/AIDS 1.6 million Malaria 0.8 million TB 1.3  million Total 3.7  million Indoor air pollution total 4.2  million As you can see, the total mortality from the three diseases comes to 3.7 million in 2012, less than the 4.2 million people estimated to have died from diseases attributable to indoor air pollution. Rockall used different underlying estimates to reach a total of 2.9 million deaths due to the three diseases. Our total is higher, but we found no estimates from any source that undercut his basic point. Deaths from indoor air pollution are higher than the sum of deaths from the world’s major leading infectious diseases. Counting deaths from indoor air pollution is more complicated than tracking deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Mark Wilson, professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, said it is easier to identify someone who has HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. ""Much more difficult is defining how one dies from indoor air pollution because it will never be the sole immediate cause of death,"" Wilson said. ""Rather, a variety of physiological, immunological and toxicological processes would compromise someone’s health, such that the cause might be defined as some sort of respiratory insufficiency, asthma, heart disease, etcetera."" The WHO study made various assumptions to link diseases such as lung cancer, pneumonia, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ischemic heart disease to indoor air pollution. Rockall said more people die of indoor air pollution than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined. We compared 2012 estimates of indoor air pollution deaths to a range of estimates for the three infectious diseases for 2012 and later. No matter how we did it, the deaths due to indoor air pollution trumped those due to HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. But an epidemiologist offered the caveat that the indoor air pollution study relied on assumptions that introduce a greater chance of uncertainty than counts of deaths from the leading infectious diseases. For that reason, we rate this statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/may/18/james-rockall/yes-indoor-air-pollution-kills-more-hivaids-malari/

Obama statue replacing Jefferson Davis in New Orleans, fake news website says

New York farmers close to dumping milk over Canadian trade dispute
","You’re not supposed to cry over spilt milk -- unless you’re a dairy farmer in upstate New York. Rep. Chris Collins says a trade dispute with the Canada has forced New York state farmers to dump their milk ""into ditches"" because they can no longer sell it across the border. ""They’ve now taken something they call ultra-filtered milk. They effectively with a pricing move, our dairy farmers are no longer able to get that product into Canada,"" Collins said in an interview with Bloomberg. ""They are now dumping milk into the ditches. The travesty there is beyond belief to see tankers of milk being dumped because there’s no market to sell them in."" The dispute began last year when the Canadian dairy industry created a new pricing class for ultra-filtered milk, a protein-heavy version of the milk you buy at the supermarket. It’s typically used to produce yogurt and certain cheeses. The new pricing class lowered the price of ultra-filtered milk from Canadian dairy producers, making it cheaper for companies in Canada to buy the product domestically instead of importing it from New York state. The new pricing class took effect at the beginning of April. Both Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and President Donald Trump have criticized Canada for the action, saying it hurts the state’s dairy industry. But is Collins right that the dispute has forced farmers to dump milk into ditches? Dairy processors A spokesman for Collins’ office could not point to any farms that have dumped milk because of the trade dispute, but did say the congressman was talking about farmers in New York state. There are two major processing facilities in New York state that export ultra-filtered milk to Canada: Cayuga Milk Ingredients in Auburn and O-AT-KA Milk Products in Batavia. O-AT-KA is mostly supplied by Upstate Niagara Cooperative but also receives milk from Dairy Farmers of America. Cayuga Milk Ingredients, itself a cooperative, receives milk from 30 local dairy farms. The cooperatives are responsible for marketing their members’ milk to processors and elsewhere. If a member’s product has to be dumped, the loss is spread across all members of the cooperative instead of an individual farmer. Craig S. Alexander, vice president for dairy ingredients and regulatory affairs at O-AT-KA, said no milk from Upstate Niagara Cooperative has been dumped because of the Canada issue. ""We haven’t dumped any milk yet,"" Alexander said. ""However, it’s an evolving situation and the milk supply hasn’t peaked seasonally yet so it’s really week to week to see if we can make ends meet."" Alexander says the dispute could lead to a loss of $20 million for the company if it’s not resolved. Dairy Farmers of America did not reply to our inquiry. The situation is similar in Auburn. ""We’ve been close to dumping but we’ve been able to manage it,"" said Kevin Ellis, CEO of Cayuga Milk Ingredients. ""I’m responsible for marketing the milk, and I’ve been able to effectively market it."" Ellis says the trade dispute threatens $30 million of its annual sales to Canadian markets, about 25 percent of total revenue. The New York Farm Bureau, the Northeast Dairy Producers Association, the Northeast Dairy Foods Association, the American Dairy Association Northeast, and the state Department of Agriculture did not know of any farmers dumping milk because of the problem. Dumping data Some milk has been dumped in the Northeast. Neither the state nor federal Departments of Agriculture tracks how much milk is dumped by state, but federal data shows the amount of milk dumped in a specific region. In the region that includes part of upstate New York and other states in the Northeast, 44.8 million pounds of milk were dumped in the first three months of this year, about 40 percent of the total milk dumped in the U.S. during that time. That’s more than twice the amount of milk dumped in the first three months of last year, but still less than 1 percent of the milk produced in the region. The numbers include more than just milk that was dumped because it couldn’t be sold. It includes milk dumped in all circumstances, like milk used for animal feed. Dumping milk is rarely a total loss for farmers. Processors will often take the cream from milk to sell, leaving only the skim part to be dumped. When processors have no demand for any part of the milk, cooperatives will dump the extra product. But there are rules for how this is done. State regulations require farmers to dispose of excess milk by either adding it to their manure storage structure or by directly applying it to fields to recycle the nutrients. Any dumping that may lead to a waterway, like a ditch, would be a violation of the state Environmental Conservation Law. Our ruling Collins said farmers ""are now dumping milk into the ditches"" because of a trade dispute with Canada. The Canadian dairy industry's new pricing for ultra-filtered milk affects dairy processors and farmers in upstate New York, but we could not find any who have dumped their milk because of the trade dispute. It has been more difficult for dairy producers to find a market for their product for the last few years because of a persistent milk glut in the United States. Collins points out the dispute has made it harder for processors to bring milk to market. Indeed, farmers might begin dumping their milk soon if the trend continues. But we found no evidence, and he has not provided any, that it has happened yet. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2017/may/18/chris-collins/new-york-farmers-close-dumping-milk-over-canadian-/

Mary González says abortions safer than vasectomies
","A Democrat opposed to an abortion-related measure suggested that a snip exclusive to men has proved less safe than an abortion. Rep. Mary González of Clint asked the proposal’s author, Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, in May 2017 floor debate: ""First and foremost, did you know that an abortion procedure is actually... safer than a vasectomy?"" Capriglione, R-Southlake, replied that he hadn’t researched complications from procedures other than abortion and he also doesn’t believe all outcomes of abortion procedures in Texas are currently reported. His House Bill 2962 requires hospitals to submit reports to the state on abortion complications. Capriglione added: ""Not all medical procedures are equally important."" Maybe not. Still, are abortions safer than vasectomies? Representative cites Texas figures, Kentucky story A González aide, Andrea Chevalier, said by email the legislator based her abortion-vasectomy safety claim on figures in a Texas Tribune news story and a Kentucky report. The cited June 2016 news story says that according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, fewer than 1 percent of Texas abortions in 2014 resulted in any complication to the woman. The story says the overall number of abortions in Texas had dropped to 54,902 from 63,849 in 2013 in the wake of changes in law, advanced by Republicans, expected to drive down the number of abortions by imposing hospital-level safety standards for clinics and requiring physician-providers to hold admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. Chevalier said that according to a 2006 article by two Kentucky physicians, the incidence of complications such as infection and bleeding from vasectomies can be as high as 15 percent. The article, published in American Family Physician, includes a chart indicating that how a man’s scrotum is penetrated to begin a vasectomy can result in different complication rates. ""No-scalpel vasectomy has been shown to reduce the risk of complications (i.e., bleeding and infection) compared with the incision technique,"" the article says. The chart, citing three studies published from 1990 through 2002, shows varied complication rates of 0.2 percent to 15.9 percent--and also wide variations in the results:        SOURCE: Study, ""Vasectomy: An Update,"" American Family Physician, Dec. 15, 2016 (accessed May 15, 2017) We tried to reach the lead author of the update, Tennessee physician Paul Dassow, and didn’t hear back. We turned next to our own research. Abortion complications When we queried DSHS officials about complications due to abortions or vasectomies, spokesman Chris Van Deusen said by email the state doesn’t track fall-out from vasectomies. Van Deusen otherwise pointed us to agency-posted counts indicating that 54,310 Texas residents had abortions in the state in 2015. A separate chart says 52,938 abortion procedures led to no reported complications with 25 procedures resulting in complications, including 10 hemorrhages--which breaks out to a complication rate of less than one-tenth of 1 percent:                ^^ Abortions that took place outside of Texas. SOURCE: Chart on web page, ""Selected Characteristics of Induced Terminations of Pregnancy, Texas Residence, 2015,"" Texas Department of State Health Services, last updated March 22, 2017 (accessed May 15, 2017) For national perspective, we emailed Rebecca Wind of the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health and abortion rights nonprofit. Wind answered by pointing out the institute’s January 2017 ""fact sheet,"" which states a first-trimester abortion carries a risk of less than 0.05 percent of ""major complications that might need hospital care."" A footnote notes a California study, published in 2013, that tallied a total of six major complications after 11,487 abortions. The study said complications of any kind--mostly minor--occurred 1.3 percent of the time. Also to our email inquiry, Barbara Tims of the Texas Medical Association pointed out a 2015 review of 57 studies of abortion complications published from 1980 through April 2015. With few exceptions, the review said, 1 percent or fewer first-trimester abortions resulted in ""cervical laceration needing sutures or hemorrhage that required medical management."" Also, the report said, physicians who provided antibiotics to women after an abortion said that less than 2 percent of the patients developed infections. The researchers wrote: ""Major complications following first-trimester aspiration abortion were very rare. Unanticipated abdominal procedures and hemorrhage requiring transfusion occurred in ≤0.1% of abortions, and the proportion of patients requiring hospitalization to treat major complications was less than <0.5% in most studies reviewed. Vasectomy complications Wind said the institute doesn’t have expertise on vasectomy complications. But she helped us track down a 2005 analysis of available worldwide evidence for a British medical journal that said: ""Vasectomy, though safe and relatively simple, requires a high level of expertise to minimize complications."" An accompanying chart indicates a 2 percent chance of hematoma, meaning swelling due to blood clotting. ""The incidence of hematoma formation,"" the article states, ""seems to correlate with the surgical experience. The hematoma rate was 4.6% for those performing 1–10 vasectomies per year, as against 1.6% for those performing 11–50 vasectomies a year,"" the article states, footnoting a U.S. study published in 1987. On the high end, the chart shows an average 3.4 percent chance of infection which the article says includes wound, urinary and epididymal infection. Separately, Tims of the TMA pointed out a July 2016 article from the Canadian Urological Association, footnoted to studies from 1984 through 2007, describing varied complication rates from vasectomies. The article states: ""Men must be informed about wound care and the potential for early complications: infection (0.2‒1.5%), bleeding or hematoma (4‒20%), and primary surgical failure (0.2‒5%). Men should also be made aware of late complications: chronic scrotal pain (1‒14%) and delayed vasectomy failure (0.05‒1%)."" We also queried the American Urological Association; by email, spokesman Brandon Corbett guided us to its ""Guideline"" for physicians, last amended in 2015, which states: ""The rates of surgical complications"" from vasectomies ""such as symptomatic hematoma and infection are 1-2%. These rates vary with the surgeon's experience and the criteria used to diagnose these conditions."" Our ruling González said an ""abortion procedure is actually safer than a vasectomy."" Both procedures rarely have complications, a clarification missing from this declaration. That said, abortion procedures appear to have lower complication rates. We rate the claim Mostly True.

Jorge Ramos: Border communities some of the safest in the United States
","Univision journalist Jorge Ramos said President Donald Trump’s promised border wall is built on a false premise. Ramos appeared on Fox News on May 12 and told Tucker Carlson that there is ""no invasion"" of immigrants coming illegally. Ramos said the number of immigrants in the country illegally has been stable, at about 11 million, over the past half decade, and more Mexicans are leaving than coming to the United States (which we have rated True). ""You know, whatever we’re doing at the border somehow is working. Some of the safest communities in the United States are along the border,"" Ramos said. ""So, I don't think a wall is really going to help."" Studies show immigrants are less likely to commit crime than the native-born population, though the Trump administration often backs its tough stance against illegal immigration with claims that immigrants bring a wave of crime and threaten public safety. We wanted to know if the border region has some of the country’s safest communities, as Ramos claimed. FBI data shows they have lower violent crime rates than other places (though the FBI has cautioned against making safety comparisons), and some local crime statistics show drops in crime in recent years. One possible explanation: Border towns have a heavier presence of federal and local law enforcement. The U.S.-Mexico region includes the four U.S. states of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas and six Mexican states. Some estimates pin the population in the border region (from both Mexico and the United States) at more than 15 million people, as of 2015. Many of the residents live on one side of the border and work on the other, with likely 1 million legal border crossings daily. Ramos has a point that these communities tend to be safe. The most common kinds of crime are those that ail other poor communities, such as drinking and driving, and domestic violence, said Tony Payan, a fellow and director of the Mexico Center at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. ""The murder rates, however, are indeed very low,"" Payan said. He said it’s very difficult to tell exactly why those communities don’t have high levels of crime, but would not disregard as a deterrent the heavy presence of law enforcement. ""But it may also have to do with other issues like the crime levels among migrants,"" Payan said. ""It is well known, contrary to what Mr. Trump may say, that crime among migrant communities is lower than that among natives. And those communities tend to have very high migrant communities and foreign-born populations."" When we asked Ramos about his comment, he pointed to reports in the Huffington Post and the Texas Tribune. The April 2015 Huffington Post report quotes former U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner David Aguilar at a 2015 Border Security Expo event. Aguilar reportedly said that border communities are safer than the interior of each of the border states — as well as Washington, D.C. — and ""violent crime is lesser along the border than it is in the interior."" Robert Harris, then a commander heading a joint task force for the Department of Homeland Security, told the Huffington Post that violence on the Mexican side of the border did not reach the United States sector because criminal groups were less organized in the United States. The February 2016 Texas Tribune analysis offered some support for Ramos’ statement. The Tribune article said that based on state and federal data, violent crime rates in many border cities either remained the same or dropped between 2009 and 2014 -- setting them apart from larger cities in the state. In Houston, for instance, the violent crime rate was at 991 crimes for every 100,000 residents, according to data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program. The border cities of Laredo, El Paso, Edinburg and Brownsville recorded fewer than 400 crimes for every 100,000 residents, the Tribune said. It’s important to keep in mind that the FBI has warned against using its data to rank and compare the safety of communities, because such comparisons may neglect unique factors in each locale. CQ Press years ago ceased using the words ""safest"" and ""dangerous"" in its annual rankings of cities with the lowest and highest crime rate. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas considered the FBI’s cautionary note in a past fact-check of a claim that El Paso is the safest city in Texas and in the United States. PolitiFact Texas rated that claim Half True, because it was based on CQ Press’ past lists and related news stories that labeled El Paso the safest. Also, the rankings did not factor in every Texas burg and did not account for differences in population density, PolitiFact Texas found. (PolitiFact Texas analyzed crime in Texas in another fact-check in 2014, rating Half True a claim about less crime in the Rio Grande Valley than in other major Texas cities.) In its report, the Tribune also noted that border communities have a large presence of local and federal law enforcement officers. Ponce Treviño, Webb County Jail commander, told the news organization: ""You've got to understand, we're a border city so we have a lot of local law enforcement. You have Laredo (Police Department). You have Webb County Sheriff's Office. You've got the constables. Then you have the federal government here. You've got customs. You've got border patrol. You've got ICE. You have a big influx of law enforcement and there's officer presence, so that makes the crime rate a lot lower."" In 2011, the Austin American-Statesman analyzed all 14 counties sharing a border with Mexico and two dozen border cities. It found that between 2006 and 2010, violent crime on the U.S. side fell 3.3 percent. The combined number of murders in the 14 counties also dropped, from 97 in 2006 to 73 in 2010, according to the newspaper. The newspaper said its data analysis did not paint a picture of ""out-of-control chaos"" at the border, although some areas did see a rise in crime. ""Violent crime increased in seven border counties, although those tended to be among the region's least populated, so a small number of incidents can have an outsize effect on rates,"" the Statesman reported. ""Aggravated assaults, in particular, spiked in Starr County and the city of El Paso, the latter long held up as a paragon of border safety."" While violent crime overall decreased in the border, it ""badly trailed"" the more than 12 percent statewide decrease in that same timeframe, the newspaper found. Ramos said, ""Some of the safest communities in the United States are along the border."" Violent crime rates in some border communities are lower than in other parts of the United States, according to FBI data. The FBI has warned against using its crime rates to rank communities’ safety because doing so overlooks other factors. Yet, local law enforcement officials have said crime is low in their border communities, and heavy federal and local law enforcement presence may be deterring crime in border communities.  Overall, we rate Ramos’ statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/may/17/jorge-ramos/jorge-ramos-border-communities-some-safest-country/

Rick Scott, who can veto the entire education bill or sign it in the coming weeks. In March, both chambers produced bills -- HB 7069 in the House and SB 1552 in the Senate -- to expand eligibility criteria for bonuses to top public school teachers under the Florida Best and Brightest Teacher Scholarship Program. Lawmakers wanted to add in bonuses for principals, and the House budget proposal called for $214 million to the expanded program in the 2017-18 budget, up from the $49 million this year. Two House committees voted in favor of the bill at public meetings on March 10 and March 29. Although senators also expressed interest in expanding the program, the Senate’s initial budget proposal included no such funding. The decision was part of a strategic move in hopes that the Senate would get some of its priorities in later negotiations with the House. On April 13, the House version passed the House (79-38). The Senate voted unanimously -- but not to pass the bill, rather to send it to budget conference. HB 7069 was among four K-12 policy bills sent into conference negotiations. Conference negotiations between members of both the House and Senate are common to work out differences in spending allocations, but it is unusual to resolve policy disagreements. Watchdogs raised concerns that policy and funding decisions would be hashed out in secret. Legislative leaders repeatedly vowed a transparent process. But by Saturday, April 29 -- three days before lawmakers needed to agree on a final total state budget in order to end session on time -- House and Senate leaders still hadn’t released proposed language to be discussed, including about the teacher bonuses.   House and Senate negotiators -- Hialeah Republican Rep. Manny Diaz Jr. and Altamonte Springs Republican Sen. David Simmons -- told the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald that they would not release draft language until the House and Senate were ready to exchange formal offers. While Florida’s Sunshine Law bans city or county commissioners from meeting in secret to hash out legislation, two legislators are allowed to meet in private under limited circumstances before voting in public on legislation. While a budget conference subcommittee held a brief public meeting that Saturday morning to trade spending offers, they revealed little about what their intentions were for the policy bills. Ultimately, legislators couldn’t agree on the overall state budget on time, which led to an extension of the session from Friday, May 5 to Monday, May 8. During the final week of the regularly scheduled session, Corcoran and Negron -- with help from other key lawmakers, such as Simmons, Diaz and House Education chairman Michael Bileca, R-Miami -- negotiated in private a catch-all education bill that included a final version of the teacher bonuses language, the policies of the other K-12 budget bills and myriad other proposals unrelated to spending. That final version of HB 7069 was made public for the first time on Friday evening May 5. Several newspapers -- including the Herald and Times, the Tallahassee Democrat, the Gainesville Sun, the Orlando Sentinel -- wrote that final legislation was hammered out behind closed doors. ""State lawmakers flushed promises of transparency down the toilet,"" wrote the Gainesville Sun editorial board. There were a few differences in the teacher bonus program as outlined in the final version in May, compared to the original House version in March. The most significant change -- and one not previously contemplated or discussed in public -- was that the final version added the ability for teachers to get bonuses over the next three years of $1,200 if they were ""highly effective"" or up to $800 if rated ""effective."" Corcoran and Negron publicly discussed HB 7069 for 10 minutes May 5 without any substantive debate of the contents before formally accepting it. The Times/Herald submitted several questions to Corcoran’s office May 6 after the final language of HB 7069 was made public. An explanation provided in the speaker’s response: ""Negotiating solutions when there are significant differences between the two chambers on an issue in conference sometimes requires adding new language and bringing in issues that were not part of the budget conference. That is often what it takes to reach agreement and is inherent to the conference process."" On May 8, both chambers met for the final day of the session. Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, the Senate’s appropriations chairman, took responsibility for allowing HB 7069 to balloon so much. But he urged passage anyway. The House (73-36) and Senate (20-18) both voted in favor of the final compromise version of HB 7069 that was decided in budget conference. In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Corcoran spokesman Fred Piccolo defended the process that led to the final version. He said that Corcoran’s tweet didn’t mention anything about discussions during conference. ""I get folks don’t like it, but because it wasn’t talked about during a public budget conference debate doesn’t mean it wasn’t publicly discussed for months beforehand,"" he said. The same argument could be made about any other type of legislation -- from the environment to health care -- if it was discussed during a conference, he said. Corcoran tweeted that it is a myth that education legislation was ""negotiated in secret."" Corcoran pointed to the filing of HB 7069 in the House on March 10 and its passage in two committees and then the House on April 13. While part of the legislative process was done in public, Corcoran omits that the final dealmaking between the House and Senate was largely done behind closed doors.
