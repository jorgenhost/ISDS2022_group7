U. S. Rep. David Cicilline says that when he was mayor of Providence, the city’s internal auditor was not blocked from accessing financial records
"," U.S. Rep. David Cicilline is facing a tough reelection campaign, in part, because by the time he finished his tenure as mayor of Providence, the city was in horrible financial shape and Cicilline, during his 2010 congressional campaign, had characterized the city's fiscal status as ""excellent.""

Making matters worse are allegations that Cicilline tried to hide the problems from Providence's internal auditor.

Not surprisingly, the issue came up Sept. 4 when he debated his opponent in the 1st District Democratic primary, Anthony Gemma, on WPRO radio.

""The fact of the matter is he locked out the city auditor,"" Gemma said of Cicilline. ""So why would you lock out the city auditor, when the auditor needs to file for a Freedom of Information request to get in to do the very job that he was supposed to do, when you're not trying to hide something?""

Cicilline called the allegation ""absolutely false. The auditor was not locked out and so that is absolutely untrue.""

Cicilline's emphatic denial seemed ripe for an audit of its own.

At the center of this dispute is James J. Lombardi III, who served as Providence's internal auditor and, as an employee of the City Council, had a sometimes contentious relationship with the Cicilline administration. He is now the city's treasurer. (The city also has an external audit done every year by an outside company. That report, dated January 2011, confirmed the financial problems.)

In the fall of 2010, when Cicilline was winding down his tenure as mayor and in the middle of a tough race for the U.S. House, Lombardi was complaining that Providence's finances were in trouble and he was having trouble getting access to information.

We found some justification for Gemma's assertion that Lombardi was ""locked out.""

Two Providence Journal stories by two different reporters in March 2011 reported that Lombardi said the administration had canceled his computer access when he began to ask questions about the city's finances, forcing him to seek information by filing formal requests under the Rhode Island Access to Public Records Act.

Lombardi now says that he was never locked out of his computer. His computer access to city financial records was never canceled, he said,  because he never had such access in the first place.

Nor was he ever physically locked out of his office or anywhere else where he tried to get records.

That would mean Cicilline is correct in the strictest sense of the phrase ""locked out.""

But you can still be figuratively locked out if you are denied access to something you're legally entitled to.

Providence's City Charter requires the City Council to appoint an internal auditor who ""shall have access to the books and records of all offices, department and other agencies of the city."" That section of the charter offers no limitation. The auditor reports to the council, not the mayor.

Lombardi, whose complaints about his inability to get information from the mayor's office go back to 2004, told us that in this case the problem wasn't that he was denied the information. The problem was the timeliness of the responses he was getting.

A key issue was whether the city's reserve fund -- sometimes called the rainy-day fund -- was being severely depleted. City records show that on Jan. 11, 2010, Lombardi had requested copies of all authorization forms transferring money in and out of the reserve fund in January 2010, which the Cicilline administration was tapping because of its budget problems.

Three days later, he wrote to the city solicitor's office asking it to assist with the request because, if that request was treated like other requests he had made in the past, ""I will never see it.""

Lombardi said if that couldn't be done, he would request the data under the state open records law, adding that he thought it was ""ridiculous"" that he would have to do such a thing.

He did not get the information until October 2010, according to a report he filed with the City Council. That's nine months.

When we asked the Cicilline campaign about the delay, spokesman Eric Hyers said ""there was absolutely not any plan to delay him, to do anything secretly or to stonewall him.""

Hyers said Lombardi ""had access to whatever he needed. He oftentimes had very unrealistic expectations as to what the turnaround time should be and how soon he should be provided with certain information. At times he assumed that City Hall officials were his own personal staff; they had their own jobs to do.""

Hyers said ""this constant tug of war over what he was entitled to and when he should have it was not unique to 2010. It started several, several years ago.""

We saw two other examples.

In May, according to city records, Lombardi requested a cash flow analysis and was told by the Cicilline administration that (a.) one didn't exist and (b.) the administration was not obligated to generate one just for him under the open records law.

Also in May, he asked Bruce Miller, the city's finance director, for a schedule detailing how the Cicilline administration planned to balance the city's budget. He was told that, until the plan was finalized, he wasn't entitled to see it under the open records law.

Lombardi said he ultimately received the information he wanted in October 2010. That was after the Democratic primary, where Gemma was one of Cicilline’s opponents, and before the general election, where Cicilline ran against Republican John Loughlin.

Loughlin was able to use that information in a Channel 12 debate, during which Cicilline, while touting his accomplishments as mayor, made the now-infamous declaration that Providence was in ""excellent financial condition.""

That record would become seriously tarnished after the election when an independent audit made the full extent of Providence's financial problems painfully clear.

Our ruling

Former Providence Mayor David Cicilline said that the internal auditor for the city ""was not locked out"" of access to the city's finances.

The auditor now says that he was not locked out in the usual sense of the word.

But there's a fine line between being locked out and stonewalled.

Cicilline's spokesman emphatically says that ""neither of those happened.""

But the record shows that Lombardi faced many months of delay in getting information he was entitled to by the City Charter. He was forced to use the state’s open records law to get information and waited months for it.

And key information -- that Cicilline had been tapping the rainy day fund -- wasn’t provided until October 2010, after Cicilline’s primary victory.

Whether it was part of a long-running political wrangle between the mayor and the City Council, which hires the internal auditor, is irrelevant. Open record laws require the release of information regardless of the motives of the person seeking it.

The auditor was not locked out in the strictest sense. But the inability of the internal auditor to get information that might have led to a timely disclosure of the city's serious financial problems had the same effect.

Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

"['Rhode Island', 'Taxes', 'Anthony Gemma']","
Providence taxes are among the highest in the country
","In a radio debate last week, Anthony Gemma, who is challenging U.S. Rep. David Cicilline in the 1st Congressional District Democratic primary, continued hacking away at the track record of the former Providence mayor.

Cicilline served two terms as mayor until voters elected him to Congress in 2010. Gemma has repeatedly criticized Cicilline’s erroneous assessment of city finances as ""excellent"" prior to leaving office, and during the debate at WPRO-AM 630 charged that the consequences of Cicilline’s leadership reverberate today.

""The City of Providence is in absolute shambles right now,"" said Gemma. ""The roads are bad. The taxes are amongst the highest tax rate in the entire country.""

While Gemma cited the tax rate -- a figure that can be misleading -- we assumed from the context he was talking about the tax burden -- how much residents and businesses would have to pay.

We asked Gemma’s campaign for his backup. In an e-mail, a Gemma campaign spokesman provided a link to a 2010 report by the nonpartisan Minnesota Taxpayers Association and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a Cambridge, Mass.-based nonprofit think-tank.

Their report compared, among other things, the commercial property tax rate of the largest city in each of the 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, and the two next largest cities in Illinois and New York. Of the 53 cities, Providence ranked the second highest for commercial property taxes, behind only Detroit.

The spokesman, Alex Morash, also pointed us to one of our own PolitiFact items from this past February when we checked a claim by Governor Chafee that Providence had, indeed, the second highest commercial property tax in the country.

In that item (we ruled it Mostly True), we not only referred to the Minnesota Taxpayers Association study, but also to a report done by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed policy group based in Washington, D.C., that does state-by-state tax comparisons.

They had prepared a draft report  that  compared the tax burdens a hypothetical corporation would face if setting up shop in about 100 U.S. cities. (The study looked at two cities in most states but only one city in small states such as Rhode Island.) In that study Providence would have the third-highest commercial property taxes for a corporate headquarters, behind Des Moines and Columbia, S.C.

But what about residential property taxes? How would Providence rate against other cities?

We e-mailed Richard Morrison, a spokesman for the Tax Foundation, and asked whether he knew of any studies that compared the residential property tax rate of U.S. cities.

The closest the foundation had, said Morrison, was a county comparison, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2010 American Community Survey. Using that census information and the foundation’s property tax data web tool, Providence County -- of which the city of Providence is the largest  -- had the 98th highest property taxes out of 806 counties ranked by the census bureau.

Over five years, Providence County ranked 122nd out of 2,773 counties.

Still we kept looking for a city by city comparison.

The closest we came was a 2007 analysis by the census bureau’s American Community Survey, which offered a chart comparing the residential property tax rates for the largest city in each state.

At 100-percent valuation, Providence ranked sixth in the nation with a tax rate then of $22.84 per thousand. (It is now $31.89, second only in Rhode Island to Scituate’s $32.73)

Two communities within the top five (Bridgeport, Conn., and Philadelphia) were ranked as having higher property taxes but their rates were set at less than 100 percent valuation, which could have skewed Providence’s ranking.

Our ruling

1st District Democratic congressional candidate Anthony Gemma said during a radio debate last week that Providence’s taxes are ""amongst"" the highest in the country.

The word ""amongst"" by definition implies a generality, and the apparent lack of any specific city by city studies make comparing Providence’s tax rates difficult.

Still, several studies indicate that there is a high tax cost associated with living and doing business in Providence. They all generally support Gemma’s claim but none of them is exactly on point. Therefore because the statement would need ""additional information"" for further verification, we rate it Mostly True

Barack Obama says U.S. has gained a half-million manufacturing jobs
","
During his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., President Barack Obama touted recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

""After a decade of decline, this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years,"" Obama said.

Because of the wording of his claim, we are examining whether the numbers are right, not whether Obama's policies were instrumental. To check the numbers, we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment numbers. We used seasonally adjusted statistics for manufacturing jobs.

A decade of decline

It’s not news that manufacturing jobs have been in decline in the United States in recent years, though sometimes with ups and downs. Generally, the decline has been due to broad economic shifts both inside and outside the United States, as well as changes in technology. Manufacturing’s share of U.S. employment was 29 percent in 1960, but it fell to just 9 percent by 2011. Even the raw numbers of manufacturing jobs fell over that period -- from 15.7 million to 11.7 million -- despite a large expansion of the overall U.S. workforce.

Between December 1999 and December 2009 -- the decade Obama appears to be referring to -- manufacturing employment fell from 17.3 million to 11.5 million, a decline of just over one-third. So Obama’s correct that manufacturing jobs had experienced ""a decade of decline"" by the time he took office. If you look at the chart (reproduced above) the downward slope is essentially uninterrupted.

Half a million manufacturing jobs created

During the period Obama chose -- from January 2010 to July 2012 -- manufacturing jobs began to rise again, by 532,000. That’s ""over half a million manufacturing jobs,"" as Obama put it.

It’s worth noting that while the reversal has been striking, this rise has still replaced only a fraction of the manufacturing jobs lost during the ""decade of decline."" The manufacturing jobs gained during the turnaround replaced less than 10 percent of the jobs lost during the decade of decline.

Our rating

The rise in manufacturing jobs that Obama is referring to may be modest compared to the prior decade’s decline, but he has described the numbers carefully. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973E6F00>],/factchecks/2012/sep/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-has-gained-half-million-ma/

Granholm says Romney's response to auto crisis was 'Let Detroit go bankrupt'
","
Judging by the number of times they have brought it up in Charlotte, N.C., Democrats are ecstatic about the resurgence of the American auto industry. They offer it as slam-dunk proof that government intervention can revive, not stifle, private enterprise.

Jennifer Granholm, former governor of Michigan, took her moment at the podium and got the crowd roaring as she touted President Barack Obama's response to the crisis. ""He organized a rescue! He made the tough calls! And he saved the American auto industry! And you know, you know...Mitt Romney saw the same crisis and you know what he said: 'Let Detroit go bankrupt.' ""

Democrats like that line about Romney so much that, later in the speech, they projected the headline on the gigantic screen behind Granholm.

But here are some facts. Romney wrote an op-ed for the New York Times in November 2008. The headline does say ""Let Detroit go bankrupt,"" but Romney didn’t write that headline and those words don't appear in the text of the article. The line came from a headline writer at the New York Times.

We thought we should look at what Romney actually said and see if it represents the sort of callous tough talk that Granholm suggests.

Auto makers in crisis

When Romney wrote that piece, the Big Three - Ford, General Motors and Chrysler -- had just asked Washington for a bailout. With sales at their lowest levels in decades, credit markets frozen and cash running short, they were after $25 billion in loans. Democrats favored the deal if the government got a stake in the firms and could swap out some of the automaker CEOs. Many Republicans favored bankruptcy.

""I don't believe that the $25 billion they're talking about will make them survive,"" said Sen. Richard Shelby R-Ala. ""It's just postponing the inevitable.""

Generally, Republicans opposed government intervention. They believed the carmakers suffered from fundamental problems that only a bankruptcy could flush clean.

In that context, when people read the op-ed headline, they might have thought Romney meant ""Let Detroit go belly up.""

But that was not his point. Romney offered a more nuanced view of what ought to emerge out of a bankruptcy. It is worth reading what he said:
  
If General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye. It won’t go overnight, but its demise will be virtually guaranteed. 
Without that bailout, Detroit will need to drastically restructure itself. With it, the automakers will stay the course — the suicidal course of declining market shares, insurmountable labor and retiree burdens, technology atrophy, product inferiority and never-ending job losses. Detroit needs a turnaround, not a check. 
Romney called for a ""managed bankruptcy."" He didn’t define the terms, but he did list some of the desired outcomes. 
• New labor agreements to align pay and benefits to match those of workers at competitors such as BMW, Honda, Nissan and Toyota. Plus, lower retiree benefits. 
• Management as-is must go. New faces should be recruited from unrelated industries. 
• A new direction for the United Auto Workers, profit sharing or stock grants to all employees and a change in Big Three management culture. 
• An end to executive perks such as jets and private dining rooms. 
Romney had other items on his list, including making sure shareholders and lenders took it on the chin. ""They bet on management and they lost,"" he said.

As for the government’s role, he said it should invest in basic research in energy, fuel efficiency and advanced materials that would help carmakers produce better vehicles. At the very end of the op-ed, Romney said, ""the federal government should provide guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing and assure car buyers that their warranties are not at risk.""

In 2012, about four years after that first op-ed, Romney wrote another one. In it, he wrote ""The course I recommended was eventually followed. GM entered managed bankruptcy in June 2009 and exited it a month later in July. The Chrysler timeline was similarly swift.""

Romney went on to fault the administration for unfairly rewarding the unions with billions of dollars. ""Crony capitalism"" he called it.

That criticism aside, Romney is right in that many of the outcomes he listed in 2008 came to pass. The health benefits of retirees were taken completely off the automakers’ books and became the sole responsibility of a trust fund. Labor costs fell dramatically and now are on par with those of Honda, Toyota and other foreign automakers. That trust fund holds a large stake in Chrysler and a much smaller but still significant stake in General Motors. It might not be the form of employee stock ownership Romney had in mind, but it does tie the fate of retired workers to the profits of the company.

What Romney never mentioned in 2008 is what Washington would do to bring about those changes. The outcomes he praises came with a price tag of $23 billion, according to a recent Treasury Department estimate. That’s the gap between the $80 billion the government put into the deal and the $57 billion it expects back.

Romney’s managed bankruptcy would have required massive amounts of private capital, capital that would have been a challenge to raise in the best of times and this took place during a financial meltdown.

Without the infusion of cash from some source, all reports we have read and all observers we have found believe that some liquidation would have followed with much greater disruptions to the entire auto industry and the economy as a whole. However, no one knows for sure what would have been.

Our ruling

Granholm accused Romney of saying ""Let Detroit go bankrupt."" The line, a popular Democratic talking point, suggested that Romney wanted to let the auto companies go out of business.

That was the headline, which he did not write, and he was not suggesting the auto companies should go belly-up. But he did advocate a managed bankruptcy that would produce carmakers with lower labor costs and products that could compete better in the marketplace.

We rate the statement Half True. 
UPDATE: After we published this item, readers alerted us to a CBS TV interview where Romney addressed the ""go bankrupt"" question and he expanded on some of the things he mentioned in the op-ed about the need for a managed bankruptcy.

Romney stood behind the title of his op-ed, ""Let Detroit go bankrupt,"" but said his main point was to oppose government handouts with no strings attached and no demand that the automakers break away from the costs that were dragging them down. Bankruptcy was the way to make the necessary changes and would not be a liquidation.

Romney did use the words about letting Detroit go bankrupt but his meaning was more nuanced and he emphasized that he was not referring to liquidation. Our ruling does not change.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097712740>],/factchecks/2012/sep/07/jennifer-granholm/granholm-says-romneys-response-auto-crisis-was-let/
"['History', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Charlie Crist says Jeb Bush said Ronald Reagan ""would have been too moderate, too reasonable for today's GOP”
","In his speech to the Democratic National Convention, Republican-turned-independent Charlie Crist said he didn’t leave the GOP, the GOP left him.

He then evoked two Republican icons to drive home his point.

""Half a century ago, Ronald Reagan, the man whose optimism was inspiring to me to enter politics, he famously said at one time that he did not leave the Democratic Party; but the party left him,"" Crist said. ""Listen, I can relate. I didn't leave the Republican Party; it left me. Then again, my friend Jeb Bush recently noted Reagan himself would have been too moderate, too reasonable for today's GOP.""

Did Crist characterize Bush’s comments accurately?

Bush made his comments on June 11, 2012, to national reporters and editors at a roundtable discussion hosted by Bloomberg View in Manhattan.

Bush had already earned a reputation for being a respected member of the GOP who was willing to stray from the party line on immigration and raise taxes to reduce the deficit.

At the breakfast, he called the current political environment ""disturbing"" and unsuitable for compromise thanks to both parties. He talked about the governing styles of his father, George H.W. Bush, and Reagan.

According to the Bloomberg report, he said, ""They got a lot of things done with bipartisan support, but right now it’s just difficult to imagine.

""Context changes; history changes. Ronald Reagan would have, based on his record of finding accommodation, finding some degree of common ground, similar to my dad, they would have a hard time if you define the Republican Party -- and I don’t -- as having an orthodoxy that doesn’t allow for disagreement,"" he said. ""We’re in a political system in general that is in a very different place right now.""

The quote was picked up by many news outlets and shorthanded much the same way Crist did in his speech at the DNC.

BuzzFeed: Jeb Bush: No Place For Father, Reagan In Today's GOP

Rachel Maddow’s blog: Jeb Bush: Reagan would have struggled with today's GOP

Bush was displeased with the tone of the coverage. He took to his Twitter account the next day and punched out the following four tweets in effort to clarify his remarks:

Am reminded today why I rarely read headlines. #ContextIsImportant

The point I was making yesterday is this: The political system today is hyperpartisan. Both sides are at fault.

My dad & Reagan sacrificed political points for good public policy.

Past 4 years, Democrats have held leadership roles w/opportunities to reach across political aisle. For sake of politics, they haven't.

Then Bush gave an email interview to the Associated Press, stressing that he meant both parties are overly partisan.

Crist’s speech misinterpreted -- as many news organizations did -- what Bush meant, said Jaryn Emhof, a Bush spokeswoman. She held up the AP’s next-day story as an example of ""one of the few who got it right.""

Our ruling

We think it’s clear Bush said the partisan divide would make it difficult for Reagan to govern the way he did (i.e., Republicans might have been mad at him for working with Democrats, and Democrats might be unwilling to work with him because he’s a Republican.) What’s murky is whether Bush said -- or suggested -- Reagan would be ""too moderate"" and ""too reasonable for today's GOP.""

We do know that Bush has since distanced himself from the suggestion that Reagan could not survive in today’s Republican Party.

In this case, we think it’s fair to dock Crist points for cherry-picking one interpretation of Bush’s statement and for failing to factor in Bush’s subsequent remarks. On balance, we rate this statement Half True. PolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the election. See video fact-checks here.",[<zip object at 0x000002809710F400>],/factchecks/2012/sep/07/charlie-crist/crist-jeb-bush-ronald-reagan-moderate-gop/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'History', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'James Clyburn']","
James Clyburn says Republicans sat on sidelines for passage of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid
","
During his speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., James Clyburn -- a South Carolinian who is the third-highest-ranking Democrat in the House -- offered an extended metaphor about how Democrats have protected Americans over the years.

""When too many of our senior citizens who were living their golden years in the darkness of economic security, Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt and a Democratic congress created Social Security, lighting a candle, while the Republicans cursed the darkness,"" Clyburn said.

""When too many of our elderly found their lives darkened by unaffordable and inaccessible health care, Lyndon Johnson and a Democratic Congress lit the candles of Medicare and Medicaid, while Republicans stood on the sidelines and cursed the darkness,"" he added.

Clyburn used some strong metaphors in that passage, but his point was clear -- that Republicans were not involved when Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid were passed.

We have looked at similar claims in the past, which we’ll recap here.

In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Social Security Act, was controversial for a number of reasons, including its perceived effects on the labor market and whether its benefits favored working white men. But some opponents, including some Republicans, spoke out forcefully against it.

As Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times recalled in a 2009 column, Daniel Reed, a Republican House member from New York, predicted that Americans would feel ""the lash of the dictator."" Sen. Daniel Hastings, a Delaware Republican, declared that the proposal would ""end the progress of a great country."" And John Taber, a GOP House member representative from New York, said, ""Never in the history of the world has any measure been brought here so insidiously designed as to prevent business recovery, to enslave workers.""

Nevertheless, on Aug. 8, 1935, the conference report — the final version of the bill that melds together changes made in the House and in the Senate — passed in the House, 372-33, with 81 Republicans voting in favor compared to just 15 against. The next day, the bill was passed in the Senate, 77-6, with 16 Republicans supporting the legislation and only 5 voting against it. So Social Security did pass with Republican support.

Decades later, the idea of federally sponsored health care was unpopular in certain segments of the Republican Party. In 1961, Ronald Reagan, the future president, released an LP with a speech in which he demonized ""socialized medicine,"" citing proposals that sound a lot like the one passed four years later.

""Write those letters now; call your friends and then tell them to write them,"" Reagan said. ""If you don't, this program, I promise you, will pass just as surely as the sun will come up tomorrow, and behind it will come other federal programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country. ... And if you don't do this and if I don't do it, one of these days we are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free.""

Other high-profile Republicans who opposed Medicare and Medicaid included Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, the party's 1964 presidential nominee.

And by 1965, as the bill that Johnson would eventually sign worked its way through the House, Republican support was scant. No Republicans voted for the bill until it reached the floor. It passed the Ways and Means Committee by a party-line vote of 17-8. And all four Republicans on the House Rules Committee — the panel that sets the boundaries of debate on all bills that come to the House floor — voted against the bill.

However, as time went on, Republican support grew. As the bill worked its way through the Senate, Republican support was somewhat stronger. In the final Finance Committee vote, the measure passed 12-5, with four of the committee's eight Republicans supporting it.

And when the House adopted a conference report, on July 27, 1965, it passed it by a 307-116 margin. That included 70 Republican ""yes"" votes, against 68 ""no"" votes.

Then, on July 28, 1965, the Senate adopted the bill by a vote of 70-24, with 13 Republicans in favor and 17 against. President Johnson signed it two days later.

So in the House, a slight majority of the Republican caucus voted for the bill, and in the Senate, a significant minority voted in favor. In neither case did Republicans as a whole ""stand on the sidelines.""

""The political parties were very different in 1965 than they are today,"" said Donald Ritchie, the historian of the U.S. Senate. ""Both had strong conservative and liberal wings, so most votes were bipartisan because the conservatives in the two parties voted against the liberals in each party. You had Republicans like Jacob Javits (N.Y.) who were more liberal than most Democrats, and Democrats like James Eastland (Miss.) who were more conservative than most Republicans. So there were Republicans who supported Medicare and Democrats who opposed it.""

Our ruling

Although some of the biggest and most vocal opponents of the bills were Republicans, it’s wrong to say that ""Republicans stood on the sidelines"" when the bills were being considered. On the final vote on Social Security, Republicans overwhelmingly supported the bill. On Medicare and Medicaid, a majority of Republicans voted for the bill in the House, as did a significant minority in the Senate. We rate Clyburn’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096656380>],/factchecks/2012/sep/07/james-clyburn/james-clyburn-says-republicans-sat-sidelines-passa/
"['National', 'Welfare', 'Rahm Emanuel']","
Rahm Emanuel says Romney asked for welfare work waiver in Massachusetts
","Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, President Barack Obama’s former chief of staff, jumped into the fray over welfare work requirements during an appearance Sunday on Meet the Press.

Emanuel also served as a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton during welfare reform in 1996. The reform law transformed welfare from an indefinite entitlement to temporary assistance that required people to eventually join the workforce. That’s what the changes Obama announced this summer are also aimed at, Emanuel said, by giving states flexibility in how they move welfare recipients into employment.

The work rule reforms, Emanuel said, ""have one goal: work. Fifty different creative ways to achieve it. Gov. Romney asked for, actually, a waiver. But you had to make sure your plan for Massachusetts, which is different than Mississippi or Alabama's or California's, achieves the goal of work. And it was every governor, regardless of party, who wanted to be creative in their own way to achieve this single goal. And that is exactly how it's supposed to work,"" Emanuel said in the Sept. 2, 2012, appearance.

Emanuel’s statement is somewhat garbled by the mixing the past (Romney’s one term as governor as Massachusetts) with the present (the changes announced by Obama this summer). But a fuller transcript of Emanuel’s comments make it fairly clear that he is accusing Romney of being hypocritical -- namely, of attacking Obama for changes to the welfare law that Romney himself once advocated.

But Emanuel’s statement went one step further -- saying Romney specifically asked for a waiver like ones Obama proposed.

Is that true?

First, some background
   
Welfare erupted as an issue in the presidential campaign in August, when the Romney campaign released an ad accusing Obama of gutting the work requirement in welfare reform.  

""Under Obama’s plan, you wouldn’t have to work and wouldn’t have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check,"" the Romney ad said.

We looked into the claim and rated it Pants On Fire. The changes Obama sought don’t eliminate the work requirement but instead give states the ability to test different programs for helping residents move toward work. (They first have to have approval of their programs from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.) A July memo from HHS specified several times that any states seeking waivers must show that employment will grow under their pilot programs.

Romney’s letter
   
We did not hear back from Emanuel or the Democratic National Committee about this claim. But we suspect it’s related to a 2005 letter that Romney and 28 other Republican governors signed in support of legislation to extend the welfare reform law.
   
The governors wrote that an extension was needed so they could effectively implement welfare block grants in their states, and they emphasized the positive aspects of a bill being considered in the Senate known as the PRIDE Act. Those included a stable funding stream, support for abstinence education, child care and, mostly notably ""increased waiver authority.""
   
""The Senate bill provides states with the flexibility to manage their (grant) programs effectively and serve low-income populations. Increased waiver authority, allowable work activities, availability of partial work credit and the ability to coordinate state programs are all important aspects of moving recipients from welfare to work,"" the letter states.
   
That sounds a lot like what the Obama administration has outlined in its memo about state waivers. But it’s not exactly a request for a waiver in Massachusetts.

What about Massachusetts?

We delved back into news coverage from 2005 and 2006 to look for any mention of Romney requesting a waiver for his state. We found he was doing something nearly opposite of that.

In 1995, the year before federal welfare reform passed, the Massachusetts Legislature enacted state reform. When federal reform passed the next year, Massachusetts received a waiver exempting it from federal welfare rules. (Keep in mind, Romney was not governor at this time.)

Here’s the Boston Globe’s report on it from the time: ""Like the federal law, the Bay State's law includes time limits and work requirements: Recipients who are not exempt are limited to 24 months of assistance in any five-year period and must work between 20 hours and 30 hours a week, depending on the age of their youngest child. With its waiver, Massachusetts continues to receive federal money, which it supplements with state tax dollars.""

In general, the federal rules were tougher than Massachusetts’, so the state was having to ratchet up its requirements in order to get in compliance.

In late 2004, a state advisory panel came up with a set of recommendations. Romney, by then in his second year as governor, offered his own outline -- and what he proposed exceeded the panel’s ideas and the federal law’s requirements.

He sought to roughly double the number of Massachusetts welfare recipients who have to work, ""eliminating exemptions for pregnant women in the third trimester, mothers with children between 1 and 2 years old, and about 5,600 people who are considered disabled under state standards but not under federal ones. His plan also would impose work requirements on recipients caring for a disabled relative and teenagers in school,"" a story in the Globe said.

Ultimately, the state Legislature took no final action to overhaul welfare. The fact remains, however, that Romney not only didn’t seek a waiver from HHS, he pushed for tougher work demands in his state.

Our ruling

Emanuel said on Meet the Press that Romney sought a state waiver for meeting federal welfare work requirements.

As governor of Massachusetts, Romney signed onto a letter supporting a bill to extend the federal welfare reform law. That letter urged greater state flexibility and increased waiver authority, which adds grist to the charge Romney is being hypocritical in attacking Obama now for gutting work requirements. It also indicates he supported the principle allowing states some waiver authority.

But Emanuel’s words were ""Romney asked for, actually, a waiver,"" and that is not true. Emanuel stretched the meaning of the 2005 letter signed by Romney and other governors, fabricating a waiver request that never existed.

The claim omits critical facts and creates an inaccurate impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ABB140>],/factchecks/2012/sep/06/rahm-emanuel/rahm-emanuel-says-romney-asked-welfare-work-waiver/

Strickland credits auto rescue for Ohio manufacturing gains
","
With jobs at the center of the presidential race, Democrats tout the revival of the American auto industry as a prime success story of the Obama administration. Former Democratic Ohio governor, Ted Strickland, made that connection when he appeared on Meet the Press last month.  

Strickland said unemployment in Ohio was below the national average and his state had ""created 45,000 new manufacturing jobs since 2010. And that's due in large part to the fact that the auto rescue has helped Ohio.""

We have examined the resurgence of the Ohio auto industry before. Republican Gov. John Kasich downplayed its impact on the state’s overall economy. We rated that Mostly True. Strickland is giving the auto bailout particular credit for growth in the manufacturing sector and that specific connection is one that we look into now.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Strickland has it right for the number of manufacturing jobs in Ohio. They went up by about 47,000 between the start of 2010 and the middle of 2012.

Where he gets into trouble is proving that a large part of the job growth is due to the automotive sector. Jobs in building cars and making the parts that go into cars did go up, but only by a bit over 5,000, or 12 percent of the total increase. That’s not a small fraction, but it doesn’t seem to qualify as a ""large part.""

We contacted Strickland’s colleagues at the Ohio Democratic Party for supporting details and they did not provide any.

However, the direct job figures don’t tell the whole story. The supply chain that feeds into a finished car is long and complicated. The BLS tracks the car parts industry, but it doesn’t track the other manufacturing jobs that supply auto parts makers. An analysis by the Center for Automotive Research, an independent group that gets some support from the auto industry, found that the number of jobs in metals, plastics and rubber that are tied to auto parts makers is about half again larger than the number of jobs in the auto parts sector itself.

It is very difficult to know how this ripple effect plays out in Ohio itself. 
""The problem is we have these artificial boundaries called state borders,"" said Kim Hill, associate research director at the Center. ""An assembly plant in Michigan can produce jobs at a Mom and Pop tool and die maker in Ohio and vice versa."" Hill says often, the small firms themselves aren't aware of the connection. 
James Rubenstein, a professor at Miami University, has drilled into the complex connections among manufacturers in the car business.

""A very high percentage of steel produced in Ohio goes to the auto industry,"" Rubenstein said. And he added, the pattern would carry through for all primary metals, machine shops and other fabricators.

The larger the fraction of steel, for example, that went to cars, the larger the number of jobs attributable to the industry. Some of those downstream companies could be selling to car makers and car part suppliers in other states. The revival of the car industry was not limited to Ohio. It also took hold in places such as Michigan, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. Increased activity there could produce jobs in Ohio.

As a final complication, Strickland tied the auto industry to manufacturing in general. At some level, when people have jobs, they buy some big ticket items such as washing machines and refrigerators. Those purchases also would generate manufacturing jobs.

The problem is, we could find no clear tally of all of these possible effects.

Based on the numbers we can find for manufacturing jobs that feed into the supply chain of auto parts, we might take the figure from the Center for Automotive Research and say that  those jobs might account for another 4,000 manufacturing workers in Ohio due to the auto industry.

If one counted all of those jobs, that would still translate into only about 20 percent of the manufacturing jobs added in the state.

Our Ruling

Strickland said that Ohio ""created 45,000 new manufacturing jobs since 2010. And that's due in large part to the fact that the auto rescue has helped Ohio.""

Strickland is right on the big number. Giving major credit to the auto industry is a harder case to make. Based on the information gathered by the BLS, the automobile sector accounted for just one-eighth of the new manufacturing jobs. There are good reasons to believe that the impact of the auto industry, both within and outside of Ohio, generated a larger impact on manufacturing jobs, but it is difficult to quantify.

We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809783D700>],/factchecks/2012/sep/06/ted-strickland/strickland-credits-auto-rescue-ohio-manufacturing-/

UAW president Bob King says auto industry has gained 250,000 jobs since mid-2009
","
One of the big themes of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., has been a celebration of what President Barack Obama did to help the automobile industry when it was teetering on the edge of financial collapse in early 2009.

Bob King -- president of the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, better known as the UAW -- emphasized that point in his speech to the convention on Sept. 5, 2012.

""President Obama took action, putting together a rescue team, demanding real change and real sacrifice from everyone involved — from management, from labor, from suppliers, from debt-holders, from dealers, from everybody involved,"" King said. ""It was not universally popular, but it was absolutely right. President Obama's strong leadership saved a million jobs. Since June 2009, this industry has added a quarter of a million jobs, and the auto industry is thriving again. These are good, middle-class jobs in glass, in plastics and steel—jobs making things for an economy built to last.""

With Detroit’s comeback such a big topic at the convention, we thought it was worth checking to see if that was accurate.

We turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment data.

There are two categories relevant to this analysis. One is ""motor vehicles and parts manufacturing."" Since June 2009, seasonally adjusted employment in this sector has increased by 165,100 jobs.

The second category is ""motor vehicle and parts dealers."" Over the same period, employment in that sector increased by 84,500.

Add these two figures together and you get 249,600 jobs -- almost exactly a quarter million.

With statements such as these, PolitiFact considers not just whether the statement is statistically accurate, but also whether the politician or party in question deserves the credit or blame attributed to it.

In this case, determining Obama’s precise role in aiding the auto industry is more a matter of opinion than fact, but experts have told us for other articles that Obama’s leadership was crucial, along with help from some Republicans. So we think it’s reasonable to credit Obama’s ""strong leadership"" with a role in producing these numbers.

Our ruling

The data will change once new jobs figures are released on Sept. 7, 2012. But at the time King made the statement, his data was correct. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809748CC40>],/factchecks/2012/sep/06/bob-king/uaw-president-bob-king-says-auto-industry-has-gain/
"['Abortion', 'Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Wisconsin', 'Gwen Moore']","
GOP House members tried to redefine rape, Democratic Rep. Gwen Moore says
","U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin was among women members of the House who made brief speeches Sept. 4, 2012, at the Democratic National Convention. Moore said she is working to end violence against women, then blasted her Republican colleagues, declaring:

""No victim of domestic violence or bullying -- man or woman -- should feel unprotected in America. Yet when Democrats acted to strengthen the Violence Against Women Act, Republicans in the House moved to weaken it. In other legislation, they have even tried to change the definition of rape.""

Let’s hit the pause button.

Did House Republicans try to redefine what constitutes rape and, as the claim suggests, thus affect what would put a perpetrator in prison?

Definition evolves

We'll begin by noting that the definition of rape has not been constant.

The ""legal definition of rape has evolved over centuries, and clearly, we’re not done fighting over it,"" Stanford University historian Estelle Freedman wrote in The Washington Post a couple of weeks before Moore’s speech. She noted that in the 1980s, for example, states began to outlaw marital rape.

In October 2011, PolitiFact National rated as Half True a claim by Vice President Joe Biden that murder and rape in Flint, Mich., increased after the police force in that city was reduced. Our colleagues noted that the FBI’s definition of rape -- ""the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will"" -- was particularly limited when compared to the definition of other law enforcement agencies, in that it excluded male victims and other types of sexual assaults.

Three months later, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting definition of rape was being revised to be more inclusive and to better reflect state codes.

Noting that the previous definition of rape had been in place since 1927, he said the new definition is: ""The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.""

Moore’s claim

To back Moore’s claim, Moore spokeswoman Nicole Williams cited two pieces of legislation relating to federal funding for abortions.

So, although Moore’s statement was broad -- House Republicans ""tried to change the definition of rape"" -- what she cites as evidence is much narrower, having to do with how rape is defined when federal money is used to pay for abortions.

1. No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act

Williams cited an August 2012 article in Mother Jones, a liberal magazine, on legislation regarding federal funding of abortions in cases of rape. The article said the bill was co-sponsored by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Republican Mitt Romney’s vice-presidential running mate, and GOP U.S. Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri.

(Akin, a U.S. Senate candidate, was denounced for saying in August 2012 that pregnancies are rare in cases of ""legitimate rape."" He apologized but resisted calls to drop out of the race.)

Ryan and Akin were among the co-sponsors of the legislation, which would have limited federal funding of abortions to victims of ""forcible"" rape and certain other circumstances, PolitiFact New Jersey found in rating a claim by New Jersey Democratic Party chairman John Wisniewski as True.

PolitiFact New Jersey found that the legislation, sponsored by Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, was first introduced in July 2010. With Democrats controlling the House, the bill didn't move forward.

In January 2011, after Republicans won a majority in the House, Smith reintroduced the legislation. Ryan and Akin -- along with 225 other mostly Republican House members -- again co-sponsored it. The Boston Globe reported that the bill narrowed an exemption to the Hyde Amendment, which allows federal dollars to be used for abortions in cases of rape and incest. Smith’s bill would have limited the incest exemption to minors and covered only victims of ""forcible rape.""

House Republicans never defined what constituted ""forcible rape"" and what did not, the Globe said, but the term ""forcible rape"" ignited an outcry among various critics, who said the phrase would exclude victims rapes involving drugs and victims of statutory rape. Statutory rape occurs when an individual, regardless of age, has consensual sexual relations with an individual not old enough to legally consent.

Smith dropped the forcible rape term from the bill. The revised bill passed the House, but the Democrat-controlled Senate never voted on it.

When Ryan was asked by Fox News in August 2012 about why he sought the forcible rape language, he said the bills were aimed at stopping taxpayer funding of abortion and that ""forcible rape"" was ""stock language"" used in various bills. He said he agreed with it being removed from the legislation he supported, but didn’t elaborate on what he meant by stock language.

Among those coming to Ryan’s defense was The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine. It noted, as other media have, that the intent of the word forcible was to prevent taxpayer-funding of abortions in the case of statutory rape, such as when a 16-year-old and a 19-year-old have consensual sex.

PolitiFact Texas reached a similar conclusion in September 2012 when it rated as Half True a claim by a pro-Democratic political action committee that Ryan, Akin and Texas House Republicans backed a bill to distinguish between rape and forcible rape. According to the text of the 2010 and 2011 bills and numerous news stories, our colleagues said, ""the main purpose of the legislation was not redefining rape but limiting the use of federal funds to pay for abortion.""

2. Protect Life Act

Moore’s spokeswoman also cited the Protect Life Act, saying it also would have restricted to forcible rape the exceptions for when federal funding can be used for abortions.

The January 2011 bill, which passed the House but didn’t become law, would have amended President Barack Obama’s health care reform law to prevent federal payment to health plans that include abortion coverage, according to PolitiFact National.

Our rating

Moore said House Republicans ""tried to change the definition of rape.""

Her statement contains an element of truth, in that GOP members sought to change when federal money for abortions could be used in cases of rape, by using the term ""forcible rape.""

But the claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- the House Republicans’ effort was not to change the definition of rape, per se, but rather to restrict the use of federal funds in abortions.

We rate Moore’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972DACC0>],/factchecks/2012/sep/06/gwen-moore/gop-house-members-tried-redefine-rape-democratic-r/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Medicare', 'Bill Clinton']","
Clinton says Ryan attacked Obama for Medicare cuts reflected in Ryan's own budget
","
Bill Clinton used his nominating address at the Democratic National Convention to respond to the Republican critiques leveled at President Barack Obama during the GOP’s Tampa convention. But there was one attack in particular, he said, that ""takes some brass.""

""When Congressman (Paul) Ryan looked into that TV camera and attacked President Obama's Medicare savings as, quote, the ‘biggest coldest power play,’ I didn't know whether to laugh or cry,"" Clinton said in his Sept. 5, 2012, speech in Charlotte, N.C. ""Because, that $716 billion is exactly, to the dollar, the same amount of Medicare savings that he had in his own budget.

""You gotta give one thing, it takes some brass to attack a guy for doing what you did.""

Today, Medicare operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65. Ryan, the Republican nominee for vice president, is the head of the House Budget Committee and the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare. His idea is to eventually move Medicare toward private insurance companies by giving people a set amount to buy their own health insurance plans.

The new system would be for people who are under age 55 now, and it would give them voucher-like credits to buy traditional fee-for-service Medicare or competing private insurance plans. (The credits are sometimes called ""premium support."")

The Republican response to attacks on the Ryan plan has been to attack back, saying President Barack Obama has cut ""$700 billion"" out of Medicare. And the Democratic response to that: Well, Ryan’s plan cuts that amount, too!

For this check, we’re looking at Clinton’s claim that Ryan attacked the president for ""the same amount of Medicare savings that (Ryan) had in his own budget.""

We recently checked a similar claim from Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter that ""Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget."" We’re applying what we learned to Clinton’s remark.

$700 billion in Medicare cuts?

There are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally ""cut"" a dollar from the Medicare program’s budget.

Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years. Time’s passage has only boosted that number.

What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.

Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.

Still, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would ""cut"" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we’ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context.

Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion.

The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency with expert staff that generates projections about how laws affect the federal budget and economy, determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion.

Does the Ryan budget include the same savings as the health care law?

Now onto our second question: Does Ryan’s budget include those same reductions in Medicare spending? The short answer is yes.

Here’s what Ryan said in an interview with George Stephanopolous of ABC News in June, before his selection as Republican nominee Mitt Romney’s running mate:

Stephanopoulos: ""You know, several independent fact-checkers have taken a look at that claim, the $500 billion in Medicare cuts, and said that it's misleading. And in fact, by that accounting, your budget, your own budget, which Gov. Romney has endorsed, would also have $500 billion in Medicare cuts.""

Ryan: ""Well, our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency. What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. ..."" (Read the full exchange.)

So Ryan confirmed his budget includes the Medicare savings.

The Romney campaign got questions on this point the day after Cutter’s remarks that ""Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget,"" and issued a statement saying that Romney intended to fully repeal the federal law, including the savings for Medicare.

""Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obama’s $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,"" said Lanhee Chen, Romney’s policy director, in a statement reported by NBC News. ""A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare, ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older, and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations.""

Cutter, though, was talking about the Ryan budget, as was Clinton. We should point out that the Ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesn’t have the force of law. And its plan for Medicare hasn’t been turned into legislation that could be analyzed in detail by the CBO.

Still, Ryan himself said his plan did include the same reductions in future spending that were part of the federal health care law. He explained a few days after Cutter’s remarks that it was only because Obama’s reduction ""was already in the baseline,"" the Wall Street Journal reported. ""We would never have done it in the first place."" The article points out, however, that the budget assumed reversal of other Obama spending decisions.

So it was a choice to leave the reductions in place, likely because both sides agree on one point: Medicare spending is growing too rapidly, and it needs to reined in.

Our ruling

Clinton said that Ryan attacked the president for  ""the same amount of Medicare savings that (Ryan) had in his own budget."" Clinton is correct that the Ryan budget plan included cost savings that were part of the health care law. Just recently, the Romney campaign backed away from that plan, saying Romney’s plan would restore the spending that the health law is set to curtail, such as extra funding for private insurers under the Medicare Advantage plan.

Still, Clinton was right about the Ryan plan. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972E33C0>],/factchecks/2012/sep/06/bill-clinton/clinton-says-ryan-attacked-obama-medicare-cuts-ref/

Charlie Crist was pro-life, pro-gun and anti-tax, says George LeMieux
","
After former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist endorsed President Barack Obama and secured a speaking spot at the Democratic National Convention, Republicans pulled out the Crist files to highlight how much the Republican-turned-independent Crist had changed in just four years.

George LeMieux, a Republican and a former Crist chief of staff, wrote a biting op-ed about Crist’s former stances.

""He never met a tax increase he liked. ... The Charlie Crist I knew idolized Ronald Reagan and embraced Reagan's view of limited government. He was pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax. He believed big government was the enemy of success, and that when government taxed it took ‘your money.’""

In this fact-check we will explore whether Crist was ""pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax.""

First, we will note what Crist said of himself in February 2010: ""I am pro-life, I’m pro-gun, I’m pro-family and I’m anti-tax. And I always have been."" He made those claims at a Christian Family Coalition breakfast while running for U.S. Senate as a Republican. He would ditch the GOP label for no-party about two months later as he was struggling in his primary bid against Marco Rubio.

 ""Pro-life""

Crist’s stance on abortion over his political career is too complex to boil down to a sound bite -- even if Crist tried to do that himself at times.

When he was running for the U.S. Senate in 1998, Crist said in a questionnaire for the Tampa Bay Times that he was pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. ""I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government,"" he said. Crist said in a debate during that campaign that he would not support a constitutional ban on abortion.

In 2006, when he was running for governor, Crist said he was pro-life. But he would not support repealing Roe vs. Wade and opposed a 24-hour waiting period. ""I don't think that politicians ought to put themselves in the place of physicians, and I think it's very important to respect the medical profession,"" said Crist, whose father is a doctor.

In 2010, as a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, Crist said he would ""fight for pro-life legislative efforts.""

But later in 2010, after leaving the Republican Party, Crist vetoed a bill that would have required women seeking abortions to get an ultrasound. He said he found the requirement that women pay for the procedure ""punitive"" and that the measure was ""almost mean spirited.""

 ""Pro-gun""

When Crist was running for U.S. Senate in 2010, we reviewed a claim that he ""never wavered in his support of the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms."" We ruled that claim True and will briefly review what we found for that article.

In one of his first high-profile gun battles, then-state senator Crist blasted Gov. Lawton Chiles' last-minute effort to require criminal background checks and a waiting period for purchases made at gun shows in 1998. The legislation proposal died.

As attorney general, Crist nominated Marion P. Hammer, former president of the National Rifle Association, to the Florida Women's Hall of Fame, and she was inducted in 2004. Hammer is also the longtime president of the state’s NRA affiliate Unified Sportsmen of Florida.

In his 2006 primary against Republican rival Tom Gallagher, Crist ran an ad calling Gallagher ""anti-gun"" and highlighting Crist’s endorsement from the NRA. As governor, Crist signed into law legislation that allowed 500,000 concealed weapons permit-holders to bring their guns to work as long as the weapons remained in their vehicles.

""Anti-tax""

To examine Crist’s actions about taxes, we reviewed multiple reports from Florida TaxWatch and newspaper articles. We also interviewed staff at Florida TaxWatch as well as Amy Baker, the state’s chief economist. Here are some highlights from his tenure as governor:

2007: Crist repeatedly promised Floridians that their taxes would ""drop like a rock."" Crist and the Legislature attempted to deliver that through a question put to voters, Amendment 1, which increased the homestead property tax exemption. Voters approved it in January 2008.

Kurt Wenner, vice president of tax research at Florida TaxWatch, said that taxes didn’t really drop like a rock but ""there was some reduction in them."" But much of that happened due to the decline in property values.

In his first proposed budget in 2007, Crist called for continuing sales tax holidays and reducing the communications services tax.

2008: Crist’s budget proposal suggested dealing with a drop in revenues by using reserves and trust funds. He recommended two more sales tax holidays, one for hurricane
preparedness and one for back-to-school, a savings to taxpayers of $36 million.

2009: Crist’s budget didn’t call for general tax hikes, but he did ultimately support a $1 a pack cigarette tax hike and surcharge on other tobacco products. That tax hike added up to about $1 billion a year, said Dominic Calabro, president of Florida TaxWatch.

Crist also signed a budget that included new fees including a package of increased and new Highway Safety Fees for about $1 billion in recurring dollars.

The Miami Herald quoted Crist as saying: ""The cigarette tax is appropriate and I really view it more as a health issue than I do as a tax issue.''

If Crist had vetoed the cigarette tax, the state would have lost nearly $2 billion in federal Medicaid matching funds.

The Tampa Bay Times wrote that Crist would call taxes the ""T-word"" as if it was an obscenity but would warm up if called a ""user fee.""

2010: TaxWatch wrote that Crist’s budget proposal in January 2010 called for $2.7 billion in increased spending and $100 million in tax cuts by relying on federal money, Seminole gambling Compact and raiding trust funds.

Calabro said that Crist could have done more to reign in spending during his tenure.

But Wenner said that ""generally throughout his career (Crist) was in favor of reducing taxes for the average Floridian.""

Our ruling

LeMieux said that Gov. Charlie Crist ""was pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax."" Crist did describe himself in similar language in 2010 while he was still a Republican and running for U.S. Senate. And we agree that he was consistently for gun rights.

His record on abortion was more mixed. At different times, he called himself ""pro-life"" and he called himself ""pro-choice."" And even when he called himself ""pro-life"" in 2006, he said he would not support overturning Roe vs. Wade. In 2010, he earned cheers from abortion rights supporters when he vetoed a bill that would force women who are getting abortions to undergo an ultrasound.

Crist portrayed himself as anti-tax and generally avoided tax increases, although he did support the cigarette tax hike and other increases in fees.

On the whole, we rate this claim Mostly True.

Bill Clinton says 4.5 million jobs have been created under Barack Obama
","
During his speech to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., former President Bill Clinton repeated a talking point often used by Democrats to tout President Barack Obama’s record on job creation.

""In the last 29 months,"" Clinton said, ""our economy has produced about 4.5 million private-sector jobs.""

But Clinton is cherry-picking the numbers to paint Obama’s record in the most favorable light. Other methods show less impressive growth in jobs -- even declines.

First of all, Clinton was using private-sector job figures, not total job figures. Right off the bat, that paints Obama’s numbers favorably, since government jobs have declined during much of Obama’s term. If you count from the start of Obama’s term, private-sector jobs have increased by 332,000, but total jobs have decreased by 316,000 due to losses of government jobs.

Since this time frame includes the start of Obama’s term -- when the economy was in free fall and before Obama’s policies had time to take effect -- we don’t think this is the best way to measure it.

The way Clinton did it is another way to count it. Clinton started counting from the low point of jobs in February 2010. Using this method, private-sector jobs increased by about 4.5 million.

However, starting the count at the low point is a bit of cherry-picking.

If you instead start at the official end of the recession in June 2009, private-sector jobs increased by 3.4 million. That’s well below Clinton’s 4.5 million figure.

We realize that speakers at political conventions are going to put the best gloss on the numbers they have available, so it’s not surprising that Clinton would use the 4.5 million figure. But getting to 4.5 million requires starting the count at the most favorable point possible for Obama.

In addition, as we’ve written previously, presidents are not the only factor in job creation. The national, and world, economies are too big for any one person to control. So crediting Obama’s policies is at best partially correct because there are so many other factors -- such as policies of the Federal Reserve, the willingness of banks to lend money, and global business trends -- that play a role.

Our ruling

While it’s true that by most measures, the number of jobs in the United States has increased on Obama’s watch, Clinton has done some cherry-picking in coming up with the 4.5 million number. But he chose his words carefully in describing the jobs picture. He said, ""In the last 29 months, our economy has produced about 4.5 million private-sector jobs.""

Alabama law does not criminally punish women who get abortions
","New social media claims are circulating about a 2019 Alabama abortion law that never went into effect. A May 18 post on Instagram says, ""In Iran, if a 12-year-old girl is raped and impregnated by her father, she must carry the baby to term, or be thrown in prison for life. Wait, sorry, no, That's Alabama."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post gets the details wrong. The Alabama law specified, ""A woman who receives an abortion will not be held criminally culpable or civilly liable for receiving the abortion."" Instead, the law would have punished abortion providers. Alabama passed the law in May 2019, and it would have outlawed abortions in almost every case, including rape and incest. It was scheduled to go into effect in November that year. But in October, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction that blocked the law until it could go before higher courts, AL.com reported. The law would have made it a Class A felony for doctors to perform abortions — on par with crimes such as capital murder and first-degree kidnapping, according to CNN. In Alabama, Class A felonies carry a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum of 99 years to life. If the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, as a leaked draft opinion suggests it might, Alabama’s abortion law — which only makes an exception for abortion ""in order to prevent a serious health risk to the mother""— would immediately take effect, according to AL.com. An Instagram post says, ""In Iran, if a 12-year-old girl is raped and impregnated by her father, she must carry the baby to term, or be thrown in prison for life. Wait, sorry, no, That's Alabama."" Alabama passed a law — which never went into effect — that would have implemented a near-total ban on abortion, including in cases of rape and incest. But the law did not include any criminal or civil punishments for women receiving abortions, only for doctors providing abortions. We rate this claim False.

Georgia GOP candidate (and state ag secretary) gets it wrong on agriculture’s footprint in state
","In a quest for rural votes, candidates running statewide these days seem to be overstating agriculture’s economic role in their states. During her late surge in the Pennsylvania Senate primary, Republican Kathy Barnette told conservative host Glenn Beck that ""agriculture is the No. 1 industry here in Pennsylvania."" In reality, agriculture amounted to less than one-half of 1% of Pennsylvania’s economic activity in 2021, leaving it behind more than a dozen other major industry sectors. We rated the statement False. Not long after, we began looking into statements in advance of the May 24 Georgia primary. We found a May 13 interview that Gary Black, a GOP Senate candidate, gave to WLBB, a local media outlet in Carrollton, west of Atlanta. (Black trails Herschel Walker, the former football star, by a wide margin, according to polls.) A few minutes into the interview, Black said, ""Agriculture is still somewhere in the neighborhood of a $74 billion, $75 billion enterprise in the state of Georgia. It’s still the No. 1 sector of the economy."" However, as is the case in Pennsylvania, agriculture accounts for only a small sliver of Georgia’s economy. And Black should know this: He’s the state’s sitting agriculture secretary, capping four decades of farming experience, plus top positions with the Georgia Farm Bureau and the Georgia Agribusiness Council. According to official data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis, agriculture accounts for about 0.7% of Georgia's gross domestic product.  The No. 1 industry sector in Georgia in 2021 was finance, insurance, and real estate, at more than 25%. That was followed by professional and business services (more than 14%); manufacturing (more than 10%); and information services (almost 9%). Way down the list — below utilities and even miscellaneous — was agriculture, at less than 1% of Georgia’s total economic output.   In 2021, Georgia agriculture was a $4.6 billion industry, so collectively, it’s not peanuts. (Georgia ranks No. 1 in the nation in peanut production, and it also leads the nation in producing pecans and broilers, the official name for chickens.) Overall, Georgia ranks 17th among the 50 states in total farm receipts, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Still, in the context of a $606 billion state economy, agriculture simply isn’t the state’s No. 1 industry as measured by dollars and cents. A final note: When Black mentioned agriculture being perhaps a $75 billion enterprise in Georgia, he may have been including agriculture’s secondary and tertiary economic impacts on sectors like support services, trucking, and storage, which is a common way to describe a given industry’s total impact on the economy.  Those secondary and tertiary impacts would have been classified under other sectors in the Bureau of Economic Analysis data. Neither Black’s campaign nor the state agriculture department responded to inquiries for this article. Black said that agriculture ""is still the No. 1 sector of the economy"" in Georgia. In reality, federal data for 2021 shows that agriculture accounted for about 0.7% of Georgia's GDP, which was far down the list of biggest industry sectors in the state.

No, the US is not backing a WHO takeover of national health policies
","A flurry of claims on Facebook and conservative media outlets warn that the World Health Organization is on track to gain enormous powers that would override the health care policies of any individual government. ""The Biden administration is bringing amendments that would propose that all nations of the earth cede their sovereignty over national health care decisions to the WHO,"" former Minnesota Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann said May 9 on Steve Bannon’s War Room podcast. One online program said the WHO would be able to impose vaccine mandates and require vaccine passports. The World Health Organization has launched a public process to revamp a key guiding document, the International Health Regulations. Those rules define how the multilateral community will respond to a future pandemic. The effort to tweak them stems from criticism that the WHO took too long to declare a public health emergency over COVID-19 and that it deferred too much to China. Bachmann's claim hinges on the U.S. recommendations for the overhaul of WHO regulations. So, we read them.  In the U.S. April 12 filing, there is nothing that matches what Bachmann described. Broadly, the American changes would require the WHO to share information faster about a newly discovered public health risk. At the first sign of an outbreak in a country, the U.S. wants the WHO to help diminish the risk elsewhere by offering manpower and other resources to the immediately affected country. If that affected country rejects the help, it has two days to explain why, then the WHO shall ""immediately share"" with other countries the information about the exchange, says the U.S. amendment. Contrary to Bachmann’s assertion that the WHO would run roughshod over national sovereignty, the overall thrust of the U.S. proposed language is to add more naming and shaming techniques to the WHO’s arsenal. Bachmann said nations would ""cede their sovereignty,"" but the text of the Biden administration proposal includes no power to override what a country decides to do. The WHO can offer and recommend, but it can’t require. Bachmann is currently dean of the Robertson School of Government at Regent University, a school founded by television evangelist Pat Robertson. We emailed Bachmann and did not hear back. Bachmann said ""the Biden administration is bringing amendments that would propose that all nations of the earth cede their sovereignty over national healthcare decisions to the WHO."" The Biden administration proposal is publicly available online. It seeks to compel the WHO to engage more assertively when a health risk emerges, and to share any information it gleans with the international community more quickly. It requires the WHO to recommend actions to the affected country, and offer expertise. The sanction for nations who reject WHO assistance is public exposure. Nothing in the Biden administration proposal matches Bachmann’s interpretation.

The US government is not creating food shortages, despite claim about buffalo killed in the 1800s
","Concerns about the country’s food supply are weighing heavily on many Americans as baby formula is hard to find and international conflict threatens commodities like wheat in some parts of the world. A social media post invoking those fears harks back to U.S. history to suggest that the government is purposely creating food shortages. ""In 1873 the U.S. government killed 1.5 million buffalo to starve Native Americans so they would become more dependent on the government,"" read one such May 11 post. ""Fast forward to today, and the government is creating food shortages to achieve exactly the SAME goal!""  It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post has a point about why so many buffalo were killed in the late 1800s, but it makes an unfounded comparison: There’s no evidence the U.S. government is currently creating food shortages. In the mid-1800s, more than 30 million buffalo roamed the plains; by the end of the 19th century, only a few hundred remained.  The rapid population decline was due to overhunting, which was welcomed by U.S. officials as a way to force Native Americans in the Great Plains region to settle on reservations. Andrew Isenberg, an American history professor at the University of Kansas and the author of ""The Destruction of the Bison,"" said white hunters in the late 1800s likely killed ""far more"" than the 1.5 million buffalo mentioned in the post — a fact federal authorities knew. ""The U.S. federal government did not actively destroy bison in order to starve Indigenous people in the Great Plains into submission,"" he said. ""But the federal government stood by and refused to prevent the wasteful destruction of bison by private white hunters and then welcomed the result of the near extinction of the species: Indigenous peoples’ surrender to the reservation system.""  Bison skulls await industrial processing in Michigan in 1892. (Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library and Wikimedia Commons) Gen. William Sherman, who commanded the U.S. Army in the region, negotiated treaties with groups of Indigenous peoples in the Great Plains in the late 1860s, Isenberg said. The U.S. agreed to allow Native Americans to occupy large parts of the Great Plains ""so long as the buffalo may range thereon in such numbers as to justify the chase."" Not long after those treaties were negotiated, Isenberg said, Sherman wrote a letter saying, ""it will not be long before all of the buffalos are extinct near and between the railroads."" By 1873, welcoming the extinction of buffalo to suppress Indigenous peoples ""had become de facto government policy,"" Isenberg said. In an 1872 report, Interior Secretary Columbus Delano wrote that the buffalo’s disappearance ""must operate largely in favor of our efforts to confine the Indians to smaller areas, and compel them to abandon their nomadic customs, and establish themselves in permanent homes."" Although the decimation of the buffalo population was ultimately the work of private hunters, ""the idea that destroying bison was a way to force the surrender of Indigenous people in the Great Plains was quite overt,"" Isenberg said. While there is concern about global food shortages because of the war in Ukraine, experts told PolitiFact in April that the U.S. is less vulnerable to food shortages than poorer nations that rely largely on imports. ""The U.S. food system has a good level of self-sufficiency, so currently, it is hard to imagine empty shelves in grocery stores,"" said Ohio State University agricultural economist Seungki Lee. And though claims have surfaced suggesting the U.S. government is intentionally creating food shortages, we have found there is no evidence to back that up. A number of factors have contributed to the U.S. baby formula shortage, including a recall by a major U.S. manufacturer, existing supply chain issues associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the highly concentrated nature of the formula market.  View of almost empty baby formula shelves at a Duane Reade in New York City on May 11, 2022. (AP) A post claimed that the U.S. government’s inaction over buffalo killing that harmed Native American populations in the 1800s shows it is now ""is creating food shortages"" so that Americans are more ""dependent on the government."" Millions of buffalo were killed by hunters in the late 1800s as part of a ""de facto government policy"" meant to force Native Americans in the Great Plains to abandon their customs and accept the reservation system. This racist history, however, does not prove that the U.S. government is currently creating food shortages to force government dependence. We found no evidence to support that claim.

O'Rourke right about property tax going up under Abbott, but governor's role is indirect
","Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke is blaming Gov. Greg Abbott for high inflation in Texas, taking a page out of the GOP playbook in attacking President Joe Biden. O'Rourke released an Instagram video on April 23 with the caption, ""Greg Abbott is the single greatest driver of inflation in the state of Texas."" TV news clips were stitched together with clips of O'Rourke speaking. In one clip in the montage, O'Rourke says, ""Under Greg Abbott, property taxes have gone up $20 billion."" O'Rourke went on to say, ""When you add this to the other inflation that he's causing ... "" with more clips pointing to electricity bills, traffic backups at the border in April due to additional commercial vehicle inspections Abbott ordered that he said would improve border security, and the rising costs of internet and phone for rural Texans. Overall, O'Rourke is saying Abbott is exacerbating consumer prices in Texas, which were already rising nationwide. We looked at one component of the ad: that jaw-dropping number of a $20 billion increase in property taxes. Is it true? Nationally, inflation hit a 40-year high according to March data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, prompting criticism of Biden, especially as inflation relates to government spending. O'Rourke's campaign pointed to a Texas Taxpayers and Research Association report titled ""Relief from Rising Values: 2019 Property Tax Reforms Cutting Tax Rates at a Record Pace."" The report looked at the effects of legislation by state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, and state Rep. Dan Huberty, R-Houston, that overhauled the school finance system and local government budgeting practices and tamped down property tax increases for Texans. The association found property taxes are continuing to rise, but at a slower rate. The campaign pointed specifically to a figure in the report depicting Texas local property taxes from 2011 to 2021. Property taxes levied were just over $50 billion in 2015, when Abbott took office, and just over $70 billion in 2021. The difference is about a $20 billion increase. Data on estimated revenue from local property taxes is available on the state comptroller's website. According to the 2018-19 biennial report on property taxes by the comptroller's office, property taxes totaled $52.2 billion in 2015. Comptroller data on school district, city, county and special district property taxes indicate there was an estimated $73 billion in property taxes collected statewide in 2021. That's at least a $20 billion increase and in line with the analysis by the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association. In the six years before Abbott's election, property taxes increased to a lesser extent, but that property tax growth was constrained by the Great Recession. To note, while O'Rourke is appealing to voters who may also be homeowners, both commercial and residential property taxes are included here. Austin Community College economics professor Stuart Greenfield, whose state government career included work with economic models and how Texas distributes money to school districts, said just over half of the 2019 school district taxable value of property was single-family and multifamily homes. The Texas Taxpayers and Research Association is a lobbying organization that primarily spends its money on research. Its policy advocacy has a fiscal conservative bent, the association's President Dale Craymer said, but the organization doesn't advocate for the policies of one party over the other. Craymer said O'Rourke spoke correctly of the group's report based on the data it analyzed from the comptroller's office. The implication of O'Rourke's ad, however, is that Abbott is responsible for rising property taxes. Craymer said the role of state government is indirect at best when it comes to property taxes because rates are set locally and not by the governor or Legislature. ""Basically, the process by which rates are set and adopted is laid out in state law,"" Craymer said. ""The Legislature and the governor obviously are responsible for drafting and putting those laws in effect. But the state really doesn't have a direct say in the amount of property taxes individual jurisdictions raise."" The association's report found taxes would have been somewhat higher without two property tax changes by the Legislature in 2019. One created a process where school district property taxes would decrease over time for senior citizens, whose school district taxes are capped. The second change, Craymer said, increased the school district property tax homestead exemption for homeowners from $25,000 to $40,000, saving homeowners about $180 per year. Also in 2019, the Legislature required cities, counties and most special districts to seek voter approval to set a property tax that raises revenues more than 3.5%. For junior colleges and hospital special districts, the threshold for voter approval is 8%. For school districts, it is 2.5%. State policy also affects property values, and increases in value are tied to increases in taxes. Richard Auxier, senior policy associate at the Tax Policy Center under the Brookings Institute and Urban Institute, said the value of Texas homes is increasing alongside the rest of the country. ""While you can frame that as property taxes went up, you can flip that to home values went up,"" Auxier said. ""It's always going to be a trade-off, because people want the value of their homes to increase, but people don't want their taxes to go up."" Texas Republicans have campaigned on property tax relief, too. Abbott added property tax relief to the Legislature's third special session agenda in 2021 that resulted in a now-approved amendment to the Texas Constitution. Abbott similarly publicized his support for property tax relief as a priority in a May 2 tweet ahead of May 7 elections. Abbott's campaign responded to O'Rourke's ad by saying Abbott reduced property taxes by $18 billion since taking office and O'Rourke increased property taxes as an El Paso City Council member. Texas voters approved Proposition 2, which raises the homestead exemption for school district property taxes from $25,000 to $40,000. They also approved Proposition 1, which corrected a 2019 oversight in tax relief that did not apply to homeowners who are disabled or 65 or older because their school tax burden is capped. O'Rourke said in an April 23 Instagram video on rising inflation in Texas that, ""Under Greg Abbott, property taxes have gone up $20 billion."" Data presented in biennial reports and on the comptroller's website show that estimated revenue collected through property taxes increased by more than $20 billion. O'Rourke's figure was accurate. But property taxes are set locally, not by the state. Although state policies might indirectly affect property taxes, the governor's role in setting property taxes is indirect. We rate this as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A7D9C0>],/factchecks/2022/may/19/beto-orourke/orourke-right-about-estimated-property-tax-revenue/

Intermountain Healthcare, a Utah-based system of dozens of hospitals, discourages giving babies goat’s milk because ""for all its hype, goat’s milk is actually an unsafe choice for infants under 1 year of age."" Goat’s milk is ""extremely high in protein"" compared to human milk or formula, and the body has to make a lot of additional urine to get rid of the extra nutrition, Intermountain Healthcare wrote. It warned this can cause infants to become dehydrated.  The hospital system said there are other risks. Minerals that are excessive in goat’s milk can cause the body to become too acidic, leading to muscle spasms. Meanwhile, goat’s milk also lacks nutrients infants need to create the healthy red blood cells that help stave off fatigue, heart and breathing abnormalities, and more.  Kimberly O’Brien, a professor of human nutrition at Cornell University, said on the school’s website that ""in general, I would not advise replacing formula with goat’s milk or cow’s milk. These are not substitutes for human milk or formula.""

Democrats, who control the U.S. House, have taken no action on the bill since.  What’s more, the bill doesn’t arrange for Americans to be placed in quarantine camps.  According to a summary of the bill, written by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, it authorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to award grants for testing, contact tracing monitoring and other activities to address COVID-19.  The bill itself mentions quarantine once, saying that the Health and Human Services secretary may award grants ""to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19, to trace and monitor contacts of infected individuals, and to support the quarantine of such contacts"" through mobile health units and ""as necessary, testing individuals and providing individuals with services related to testing and quarantine at their residences.""

At the time, there were false claims that the bill allowed strangers to enter someone’s house, test them for COVID-19 and take their family members into quarantine.  ""Contact tracing is not a new idea and is regarded by the CDC as a ‘key strategy for preventing further spread of COVID-19,’"" Rush said in 2020. ""My bill, the COVID-19 TRACE Act, is about appropriately and safely using this time-tested principle to better assist the communities that are the most impacted by the coronavirus — namely the African-American community — through voluntary testing and door-to-door outreach.""  The claim that Democrats recently introduced a bill to put Americans in ""quarantine camps"" is a gross mischaracterization of the 2020 proposal.

Fact-checking claim about military families, Tricare and baby formula
","Many U.S. families are scrambling for solutions to the domestic baby formula shortage. For military parents of babies who have metabolic disorders, the U.S. Department of Defense has always provided one — but social media posts are getting the details wrong and falsely leading people to believe that it’s more widely available than it actually is. A May 15 post says that Tricare, the Defense Department's health care program, ""will now pay to have (baby formula) shipped directly to you,"" because of the shortage. It includes steps to follow, including emailing a form to Military Medical Supplies, a private company contracted to provide formula to Tricare. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But Tricare does not cover the cost of formula for all infants, only for those with metabolic disorders, it said in a May 17 statement posted on its website. Tricare also said it doesn't directly ship baby formula to beneficiaries. A small number of families — around 200 — are eligible to receive formula paid by Tricare because their infants have dietary needs requiring speciality formulas, including those formulated for feeding tubes, Military.com reported. Participation in the program requires a doctor’s order. The baby formula shortage is linked to COVID-19 related supply chain issues and a product recall that led to a temporary facility shutdown by a major formula manufacturer. About 40% of formulas are out of stock nationwide, The Atlantic reported May 12. A Facebook post claimed, ""Due to the baby formula shortage Tricare will now pay to have it shipped directly to you."" Tricare does not cover the cost of formula for all infants, but it does cover the formula for infants with metabolic disorders. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

Mail ballot problem in Pennsylvania county was a printing error, not fraud
","As the results of the Pennsylvania Republican Senate primary remained up in the air a day after the election, critics of voting by mail distorted a problem with mail ballots in Lancaster County. On election night May 17, partially counted returns were too close to determine if Mehmet Oz or Dave McCormick would emerge as the winner. The race may land within the half-percent margin to require a recount.  A problem in Lancaster emerged after 7 a.m. on Election Day when officials opened up mail ballots and found that a significant number printed by the vendor, NPC, would not scan because they had the wrong identification code. The Pennsylvania State Department said about 22,000 ballots were affected; the county will duplicate ballots by hand and scan them over the next few days.  On Twitter, some people suggested that it was a sign of voter fraud or something ""suspicious.""  ""And of course there are mail in ballot discrepancies in Lancaster County, PA,"" tweeted John Cardillo. ""We’re a third world country. Voter fraud is becoming the accepted norm."" Another person tweeted of the Lancaster ballots: ""I see a major opportunity for voter fraud."" But county and commonwealth officials told us there was no evidence of fraud. The day after the election, County Commissioner John Trescot told PolitiFact that there was ""no sign of fraud related to this printing error."" Lancaster County Detective Andrew Morgan, who works for the district attorney, told us that detectives had received no reports of fraud. Lancaster officials said the error occurred after the county had approved the vendor’s test ballots, which had the correct identification code. The vendor, NPC, did not respond to PolitiFact.  Ellen Lyon, a Pennsylvania State Department spokesperson, also said there is no indication the printing error resulted from  fraud or malicious intent.  Human error in elections happens from time to time, said David Becker, founder of the Center for Election Innovation and Research. But it’s worth noting that the problem was discovered as a result of checks and balances built into the system.  ""It appears that every single voter who cast a vote on a ballot with the printing error on it will have their votes counted correctly, thanks to procedures in place,"" Becker said.  Thirty-eight states allow officials to process ballots cast by mail before Election Day, but Pennsylvania isn’t among them. Pennsylvania law says mail ballots can’t be processed until 7 a.m. on Election Day.  So there was no way to spot the problem earlier. Election officials from both parties have urged the Pennsylvania General Assembly to allow for earlier processing of mail ballots.  ""If the legislature had acted, this would have been discovered days if not weeks before, and could have been mitigated more effectively, allowing for rapid delivery of accurate results,"" Becker said. In 2021, lawmakers passed a bill that included earlier processing of mail ballots, but Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, vetoed it, citing other aspects of the bill, including stricter voter ID requirements. Voting by mail surged in Pennsylvania starting in 2020 as a result of Act 77, the 2019 law that established no-excuse mail voting, a provision pushed by Democrats. Republicans got one of their priorities included, too: elimination of straight-ticket voting. Following Joe Biden’s presidential win in Pennsylvania, some Republicans have sought to undo the law, and the matter is in litigation. Former President Donald Trump, on his social media platform, Truth Social, used the Pennsylvania situation as another opportunity to attack voting by mail: ""Our Country should go to paper ballots, with same day voting. Just done in France, zero problems. Get Smart America!!!"" Trump’s repeated statements suggesting widespread fraud have been debunked by fact-checkers, judges and government officials. France completed its presidential election count quickly because that was the only contest on the ballot. Of all the counties in Pennsylvania, Lancaster and one other reported election issues, the State Department said. In Berks County, at least two dozen polling places had long lines as a result of problems with new electronic pollbooks. A court order extended voting in Berks County by one extra hour. The winner of the Senate Republican primary will face Democratic nominee Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. The Senate seat is being vacated by Sen. Patrick Toomey, a Republican. Social media posts extrapolated a problem with mail ballots in Lancaster County as a sign of ""voter fraud."" There is no evidence of fraud. The issue had to do with a vendor that printed the mail ballots using a wrong identification code; the ballots would not scan, so they will need to be copied by hand. County officials dismissed notions of vote tampering or other illegal activity. What happened in Lancaster is a vendor error, and suggestions that it amounts to voter fraud are wrong. We rate this claim False.  RELATED: All of our fact-checks about elections RELATED: Dave McCormick’s Truth-O-Meter RELATED: Mehmet Oz’s Truth-O-Meter RELATED: Why France reports election results faster than the US",[<zip object at 0x0000028097434180>],/factchecks/2022/may/18/tweets/mail-ballot-problem-pennsylvania-county-was-printi/

Claim that most Planned Parenthood clinics are in minority areas by 'eugenicist' design falls short
","Conservative commentator Candace Owens is no fan of Planned Parenthood, the nonprofit organization that has provided reproductive health care, including abortion services, for decades. In a recent tweet, Owens cited a statistic and the organization’s history as proof Planned Parenthood’s goals are unethical. ""79% of Planned Parenthood clinics are in minority neighborhoods,"" Owens wrote on Twitter May 3, a post that has since been shared on Facebook. ""This is not by accident. That is by its founder, Margaret Sanger's, eugenicist design. Go back and read her quotations. The Left sees racism everywhere except for where it actually is."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Planned Parenthood and supporters of its mission have indeed wrestled with the legacy left by Sanger, who opened the nation’s first birth control clinic in 1916 and five years later founded the organization that would become Planned Parenthood. Sanger embraced the idea of eugenics, defined by the National Human Genome Research Institute as the ""scientifically inaccurate theory that humans can be improved through selective breeding of populations."" But scholars who have studied her life and work say that as she expressed a eugenstic viewpoint, she did not link it to race — and there is no indication she supported abortion access or sought to use abortion as a form of genocide, as some have claimed. But we were interested in the 79% data point Owens cited. Owens told PolitiFact the source for that figure was a 2015 report by the Center for Urban Renewal and Education, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C., that was submitted to Congress. The report said the number came from ""protectingblacklife.org,"" a website associated with an anti-abortion organization. But that analysis is in dispute, and data on this matter differs. Further confusing matters, the data that is available has been produced by organizations with clear stances in the abortion debate. Some of the reports are more than10 years old. They also vary in how they analyze neighborhood demographics — and in how they evaluate the meaning of those demographics. Although Owens’ original post didn’t mention abortion, she pointed us to data specifically about abortion clinics. (Planned Parenthood has many clinics, not all of which provide abortions.) While Sanger was a champion of birth control, she was largely opposed to abortion. Planned Parenthood did not begin offering abortion services until 1970, fours years after Sanger died. Taken together, available data is inconclusive The original source of Owens’ 79% claim, protectingblacklife.org, features a map of what it says are Planned Parenthood surgical abortion facilities that are located ""within walking distance of African American or Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods.""

""2010 Census results reveal that Planned Parenthood is targeting minority neighborhoods,"" it says. ""79% of its surgical abortion facilities are located within walking distance of African American or Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods."" An abortion clinic is included on the map if it lies within 2 miles of a census tract with at least a 50% minority population or where the minority population percentage is at least 1.5 times higher than that of the surrounding county. PolitiFact reached out to the website to get more information about the data it used but didn’t hear back. Joerg Dreweke, associate director of U.S. communications at the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights research organization, took issue with the methodology. As an example, he pointed to what the map shows about the facility in Sioux City, Iowa. ""There are what looks like eight census tracts within walking distance,"" Dreweke said. ""One of these eight is 27% Hispanic, which by their definition (because it is 1.5 times higher than the county average) makes it a ‘minority neighborhood,’ and therefore the facility ‘targets’ minorities.’ But that is ridiculous on its face, from the map (and again, no idea how reliable it is), that clinic appears to be surrounded by overwhelmingly white residents."" In 2014, the Guttmacher Institute published its own report to address claims that most abortion clinics are located in predominantly Black or Hispanic neighborhoods. It was broader in scope, though and Planned Parenthood was only one of the providers included in the analysis. The report, which was based on 2011 census data, found that fewer than one in 10 clinics were located in mostly Black neighborhoods and that six in 10 abortion providers were located in neighborhoods where more than half of residents are white. Planned Parenthood cited 2015 data that said less than 4% of its clinics providing abortion services were located in communities where more than one-third of the population is Black. The original report was internal, and a Planned Parenthood spokesperson declined to share it with PolitiFact. Planned Parenthood also pointed us to research showing that, as of 2019, 56% of its health centers are in what are considered rural, medically underserved or where there are shortages of health professionals.  Sanger’s first birth control clinic opened in 1916 in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, which was mostly Irish and Jewish. When she did open a Harlem clinic in the early 1930s, about half of its patients were white. Members of the Black establishment, including W.E.B. DuBois and the Black newspaper the Amsterdam News, supported it.  Although Sanger has been criticized for supporting eugenics, historians of the movement and scholars who have studied Sanger’s life say her opinions largely centered around what would today be considered issues of public health. During Sanger’s time, one scholar wrote, ""the purpose of eugenics was to improve the human race by having people be more healthy through exercise, recreation in parks, marriage to someone free from sexually transmitted diseases, well-baby clinics, immunizations, clean food and water, proper nutrition, nonsmoking and drinking."" Those who think Sanger wanted Black genocide often cite the Negro Project, an effort launched in 1939 to bring birth control services (but not abortion) to Southern Black communities. Black leaders like DuBois, and Mary McLeod Bethune, founder of the National Council of Negro Women, and Rev. Adam Clayton Powell, pastor of the Black Abyssinian Baptist Church, were members of its advisory council. First lady Eleanor Roosevelt was also supportive. Sanger has been criticized for a particular statement from a 1939 letter she wrote advocating that organizers recruit Black ministers for the project: ""We don’t want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs."" But reporting by PolitFact Georgia found Sanger was advocating for Black doctors and ministers to play leadership roles in the project to avoid misunderstandings — she was not suggesting genocide. In addition, scholars note that her views on abortion were far from those of an advocate. In her own words: ""Although abortion may be resorted to in order to save the life of the mother, the practice of it merely for limitation of offspring is dangerous and vicious."" While she strongly condemned the practice, Sanger felt that it was ""a woman’s duty and right to have for herself the right to say when she shall and shall not have children.""  Owens claimed that ""79%"" of Planned Parenthood clinics are in minority neighborhoods. ""This is not by accident. That is by its founder, Margaret Sanger's, eugenicist design,"" she said. Data on this matter is dispute, with advocates on each side of the abortion debate arriving at separate conclusions based on different methodology. Sanger has been criticized for supporting eugenics, but scholars say her allegiance to the movement concerned public health, not race.  She also was largely opposed to abortion, and none of her clinics performed the procedure until after her death. This statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280978010C0>],/factchecks/2022/may/18/candace-owens/fact-checking-claim-most-planned-parenthood-clinic/

'False flag' claims about the shooting in Buffalo are baseless
","Ten people were shot to death by a man who police say went to a Buffalo, New York, grocery store on May 14 with the expressed purpose of killing Black people. The shooter was arrested and officials say they are investigating the incident as a racially motivated hate crime. But some social media and internet claims are falsely suggesting the whole thing is a non-story — fabricated, even.  ""Absolutely NOTHING about the ‘mass shooting’ in Buffalo, NY adds up to anything but a total false flag event,"" one person tweeted. ""I'm calling b*******."" ""Alex Jones Predicted The White Supremacist False Flag Shooting At The Grocery Store,"" read a headline on InfoWars, the website run by Jones, who has long baselessly claimed mass shootings such as the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary were fabricated. The claims cite as evidence everything from quick media response to the age of a photo included in a document the shooter was reported to have written explaining his motive. No matter what supposed evidence these posts cite, the claim, like the evidence, is wrong. ""False flag"" historically referred to military events in which forces would fly the flag of another country to deceive their enemies, or when governments staged an attack on themselves and then blamed an enemy for those violent actions. But in more recent history, actual false flag events are far outweighed by conspiracy theories that wrongly label real crises as staged — for example, the numerous theories that the 9/11 attacks weren’t real, or Jones’ repeated claim about Sandy Hook. That is the case here. In the case of the Buffalo incident, there’s plenty of evidence showing that it happened. On the afternoon of May 14, a gunman opened fire in the parking lot of Tops Friendly Grocery Store in Buffalo. He shot four people, three of whom he killed, then went inside the grocery store and shot eight more people.  In total, 13 people were shot, 10 of whom lost their lives.  Shonell Harris, a manager at Tops, told The Buffalo News that she was stocking groceries when she heard the shots.  ""I heard a noise. Then it got louder, and closer. And everybody started running towards the back,"" said Harris. She then described that once she was outside, she ran around to the front of the building, where she saw someone get shot. She then began looking for her daughter, who also worked at the store and survived the shooting. The names and photos of most of the victims have since been released. They include Katherine Massey, a 72-year-old who had written several letters about gun control reform; Aaron Salter Jr., a 55-year-old former police officer who worked as a security guard at Tops and tried to shoot at the gunman; and Roberta Drury, a 32-year-old who was helping her brother through his leukemia treatment and worked in her family's restaurant. The family of Buffalo shooting victim Ruth Whitfield, the 86-year-old mother of former Buffalo Fire Commissioner Garnell Whitfield Jr., mourns her loss during a press conference on May 16, 2022. On the day of the shooting, Ruth Whitfield had stopped at Tops Friendly Market after visiting her husband, who lives in a nursing home. (AP)  The shooter, who police have identified as 18-year-old Payton Gendron, live-streamed the event on Twitch. The social media company said in a statement that it took down the video within two minutes after the violence started. Before surrendering, Gendron initially turned the gun onto himself before being talked down by police.  Eleven who were pierced by bullets were Black. According to the online Google document linked to Gendront, he believed in the ""great replacement theory,"" which holds that immigrants and other people of color are being brought into the country to ""replace"" white voters.  The FBI is investigating the incident, with FBI Director Christopher Wray characterizing it during a May 16 conference call as ""a targeted attack, a hate crime, and an act of racially motivated violent extremism."" Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department would investigate the matter as a hate crime and an act of racially-motivated violent extremism and vowed that they were committed to conducting a ""thorough and expeditious investigation into this shooting and to seeking justice for these innocent victims."" And politicians from both sides of the U.S. political divide responded to the event with statements acknowledging the tragedy. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden on May 17 met with family members of the victims, calling it ""a murderous, racist rampage."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, called the shooter’s actions ""abhorrent.""
  Social media posts have claimed that the Buffalo mass shooting on May 14 was a false flag event.  Witness testimonies, the names and images of the victims, continuous news reports and immediate investigations of the attack from the local and federal governments prove that this was in no way staged. The shooter’s own accounts of the event give another grave angle to this tragedy and both Republican and Democratic political leaders have issued statements responding to the tragedy. In the face of clear evidence, the suggestion that this mass shooting didn’t happen is absurd.
