Randy Forbes: Sex traffickers start children at average age of 11 to 14
","U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes recently called on the U.S. to toughen its ""zero tolerance"" laws against sex trafficking.   ""The average age a child is trafficked into the commercial sex trade industry is between 11 and 14 years old,"" Forbes, R-4th, wrote in a June 16 post on his congressional website.   Statistics from the murky world of child prostitution are spotty and become even more elusive when focused on the small subgroup of child prostitutes -- perhaps 10 percent -- who have been sold into the sex trade. So we wondered whether Forbes’ statement is accurate.   In his post, Forbes hyperlinked to a bulletin from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that says, ""The children at risk are not just high school students -- studies show that the average age a child is trafficked into the commercial sex trade is between 11 and 14 years old.""   Hailey Sadler, Forbes’ spokeswoman, pointed us to two other government agencies that have made identical or similar claims. She noted two instances by the FBI and one by the Congressional Research Service.   Sometimes the agencies didn’t cite a specific study as the source of the age claim. And when they did identify a source, they credited a 2001 study at the University of Pennsylvania on child sex trafficking in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The study was largely based on interviews with child prostitutes.   ""The age range of entry into prostitution for the boys, including gay and transgender boys, was somewhat younger than that of the girls, i.e., 11-13 years vs. 12-14 years, respectively"" the report said, adding that other studies from the 1980s and 1990s found similar results.   But there are issues with the research: A small sample of child victims were interviewed -- just 63 boys and 107 girls. None of the children were controlled by sex traffickers, according to Richard Estes, a University of Pennsylvania sociologist who was lead writer of the report. ""All were street children who had run away either from their homes or an institution,"" he emailed to us. The survey dates back to the 1990s and even Estes doesn’t claim the findings are still relevant. ""No one knows what the true statistical picture looks like today in 2015 given all of the very significant legal and public awareness changes that resulted from our investigation,"" he said.   Dan Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, told us it’s implausible that children enter the sex trade at an average age of 11 - 14.   ""The use of the term ‘average’ would suggest that there’s a whole group that are starting younger than that (11-14 years old) to compensate for the kids that are older than that as well,"" Finkelhor said. ""It’s just not true.""   In other words, children who started at 16 or 17 would have to be balanced by those who started at eight or nine.   Sadler, in backing Forbes’ statement, also cited a 2009 report by Shared Hope International, an anti-trafficking group. It says ""research has shown that the average age of entry into prostitution and pornography is 12 to 14 years old in the United States."" Although there’s no research footnote, the report says the statistic is ""confirmed"" by information officials in Clark County, Nevada gathered on 96 girls -- aged 11 to 17 -- they arrested for prostitution.   The report has a chart on the ages of the girls. We did the math and found the average was 14.96 years old. That’s young, but not as young as the average ages cited by Forbes or Shared Hope.   We couldn’t find updated national figures on the child sex trade, and for good reason. Jay Albanese, a professor and criminologist at Virginia Commonwealth University, said recent research has taken municipal looks at the problem.  For example, Albanese said one study found that girls in Tijuana, Mexico were forced into prostitution between 14 to 17 years old. Another study focusing on child prostitutes in New York City found that the average age of entry into the sex trade was just over 15 years old. Another study found that in Atlanta sex trade workers interviewed averaged 14 years old.   ""Therefore, studies have found variation in the ages of  CSEC (commercially sexually exploited child) victims, which reflects the fact that these are local and regional studies---not national studies,"" Albanese said. ""But it can be said that victims across these studies are overwhelmingly teenagers.""   Getting back to Forbes, it should be noted that he is among many politicians and child advocates who have cited the average 11-14 starting age for sex trafficking victims. Finkelhor told us the claim has gained credibility by repetition, not research.   Sadler, Forbes’ spokeswoman, noted that the congressman offered a caveat further down in his web post, writing that ""human trafficking is a crime that takes many forms, so it can be difficult to quantify or track … Victims are ‘hidden’ and so much is unknown about the crime.""   With that proviso, Sadler said Forbes’ statement ""is as accurate as possible given current data.""   Our ruling   Forbes wrote,""The average age a child is trafficked into the commercial sex trade industry is between 11 and 14 years old,""   This widely-circulated claim is based on a small-sample, national survey from the late 1990s that focused on street children who resorted to prostitution. None of the children were controlled by sex traffickers. Even the main author of the report says his findings are outdated and may no longer be relevant.   We couldn’t find updated national research examining the age children enter the sex trade. Several studies in large cities put the average age around 14 or 15.   Forbes acknowledged further down in his statement that human trafficking ""can be difficult to quantify or track,"" but he didn’t tie that qualifier to the age statistic, which he stated as fact. Child prostitutes obviously enter the sex trade at young ages, but the average age is by no means established and there’s evidence it may be higher that Forbes’ figure. And again, all of the age research deals with street children -- not those who are being controlled by traffickers.   On the whole, we rate Forbes’ statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DE5B80>],/factchecks/2015/jul/06/randy-forbes/randy-forbes-says-average-age-child-sex-traffickin/

Hassan says 6,000 people on expanded Medicaid have sought treatment for addiction
","When New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan gave her state of the state address in Nashua she took time to address two priorities. One of them was extending authorization of the state’s expanded Medicaid program, which is set to wind down at the start of 2017. The other was adding resources for those struggling with drug and alcohol addiction.   The two came together in one sentence from the speech. Hassan told the crowd that, ""our bipartisan health care expansion plan provides coverage for treatment for substance and alcohol abuse, and 6,000 people have already accessed services for substance misuse through this program.""   That’s a remarkable number, given that in the same speech and news accounts, the overall number of those enrolled in the expanded Medicaid program is about 40,000. Given Hassan’s numbers, that means about 15 percent had sought treatment for drug or alcohol issues.   That would be a pretty hefty number, and would signify both a widespread problem and evidence that people are seeking and receiving treatment. Is she right? We decided to check it out.   Drug abuse in New Hampshire   But first, let’s look at some background on the problem.   In 2014, 325 people in the state died from overdoses. That was a record, and it led to new laws this legislative session. As the Concord Monitor reported earlier this month, ""senators passed a bill ... giving limited criminal immunity to people who report overdoses. Gov. Maggie Hassan signed a law last week expanding public access to the life-saving drug Narcan, an antidote to heroin overdoses.""   Members of the Executive Council are on board too.   ""There’s no question that we need to continue to support, and frankly do more, when it comes to substance abuse issues and addiction issues in New Hampshire,"" Democratic Councilor Colin Van Ostern told the Associated Press on Wednesday.   It’s also true that addicts in New Hampshire haven’t previously sought treatment in large numbers. Tym Rourke, the chairman of the Governor’s Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention, Intervention and Treatment, laid out the challenge in an education session for lawmakers in May 2014.   At the time, Rourke said that about about 5 percent of all New Hampshire residents struggling with addiction got help, the Monitor reported.   ""In the United States, if you have a substance abuse disorder, the only other state where you are less likely to get help is Texas,"" he said.   So experts agree that there is a need in the state: People with drug problems are dying, and relatively few of them are seeking treatment.   But do they amount to 6,000 of 40,000 new Medicaid enrollees?   A closer look at the numbers 
When we reached out to Hassan’s spokesman, William Hinkle, he admitted that the number was actually incorrect.   ""This number came from information that HHS presented to the substance use disorder benefit providers. At the time, HHS had said roughly 6,000 people had accessed substance misuse services under expansion and nearly 2,000 had accessed mental health services,"" Hinkle wrote. ""However, those numbers were inverted and the opposite was the case.""   We reached out to the state Department of Health and Human Services, and Director of Communications Jake Leon gave us the official numbers.   -- 1,800 different people used drug and alcohol treatment services from Sept. 1, 2014, to March 31. -- 9,000 different people used mental health services over that same period.   ""The numbers were accidentally swapped at some point,"" Leon wrote in an email. ""It was an honest but unfortunate mistake.""   Of course, the numbers weren’t simply reversed. If so, Hassan would have reported that 9,000 different people received substance abuse treatment. This wasn’t the case.   Hinkle emphasized that the numerical error doesn’t undercut the governor’s point. ""The underlying point remains true,"" Hinkle said. ""Thousands of people have accessed coverage for these services under the bipartisan expansion plan.""   When Hassan appeared at the Monitor on June 24 to talk about her plans to veto the Legislature’s budget, she used a talking point that had been revised from her Nashua speech. Now, rather than saying 6,000 had sought treatment, she merely said ""thousands.""   Peter Evers, the CEO of Riverbend Community Mental Health in Concord, said that he absolutely agreed with the governor's point. If anything, he wrote in an email, more people need help than are receiving it.   ""The need is absolutely there. The complication here is that substance misuse has such a stigma to it that it is hard for people to reach out, and getting young people into treatment is hard when they are in what is called the 'pre-contemplative'  stage of the problem, (when) they are not aware that they have a problem,"" Evers wrote.   Our ruling   In her state of the state address, Hassan said that ""6,000 people have already accessed services for substance misuse"" through the state’s Medicaid program. There is no question that substance abuse in the state is a real and pressing problem, and the statistics show that thousands have sought help as a result of the state’s expanded Medicaid program. But Hassan offered (and later corrected) a number that simply wasn’t accurate. The real total is closer to 2,000 -- about one-third the amount she cited. We rate her claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809735C340>],/factchecks/2015/jul/02/maggie-hassan/hassan-says-6000-people-expanded-medicaid-have-sou/

Democratic pundit Donna Brazile says N.J. credit rating fell record 9 time under Chris Christie
","A key talking point for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in his bid for the GOP nomination is that he is a can-do Republican in a Democratic state. That, of course, leaves him open to challenges about what he’s actually achieved. Democratic pundit and occasional party operative Donna Brazile took a jab at Christie’s track record on managing his state’s finances. ""Governor #ChrisChristie has led New Jersey to a record-breaking 9 credit downgrades. Yes, you read that right: nine credit downgrades,"" Brazile tweeted on June 30, 2015. We’ve checked similar statements about Christie before and took this moment to update our findings. In short, yes, the three major credit rating firms have collectively downgraded the state’s bond rating nine times. The latest move came from Moody’s Investor Service in April. The Moody’s rating fell from A1 to A2. The rating firm said it based the change on the state’s ""weak financial position and large structural imbalance, primarily related to continued pension contribution shortfalls."" In addition to Moody’s, there are two other rating agencies -- Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Fitch Ratings. Here’s the history of downgrades since Christie took office. Date Rating service Rating change 1 Feb. 9, 2011 Standard & Poor’s AA to AA- 2 April 27, 2011 Moody’s Aa2 to Aa3 3 Aug. 17, 2011 Fitch Ratings AA to AA- 4 April 9, 2014 Standard & Poor’s AA- to A+ 5 May 1, 2014 Fitch Ratings AA- to A+ 6 May 13, 2014 Moody’s Aa3 to A1 7 Sept. 5, 2014 Fitch Ratings A+ to A 8 Sept. 10, 2014 Standard & Poor’s A+ to A 9 April 16, 2015 Moody’s A1 to A2 Do the nine downgrades set a record? Yes, for New Jersey. According to news reports, that is the highest number ever for a single New Jersey governor. The previous record was six credit downgrades, which happened while Democrat James McGreevey was governor. McGreevey presided over his drops in less than three years in office (2002-04); Christie is in his sixth year in office. Pension system blues Ratings agencies assess the state’s ability to repay its lenders, not just today but for years to come. Their opinion matters because the lower the rating, the higher the interest rate the state faces when it wants to borrow money. A point of ongoing concern for the agencies has been New Jersey’s pension obligations. It’s total commitments are about $43 billion. According to a report by the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, as of 2013, New Jersey ranked last in the country in its efforts to put enough money into the system each year to make good on its promises to it current and future retirees. It was putting in 38 percent of what the association calculated was needed. As Moody’s put it, ""the state's plan to restore long-term structural balance relies on economic growth and further pension reforms, which have uncertain timing and impact."" Recent events in New Jersey have fueled such skepticism. In 2011, Christie struck a deal with lawmakers, and public workers, to increase state contributions to the pension funds in exchange for higher payments from employees, a bump in the retirement age, and lower cost-of-living increases for retirees. But in 2014, with tax revenues coming in lower than predicted, Christie trimmed the state’s pension payments. Christie says deeper changes are needed. Does Christie deserve all the blame for this mess? No. Democratic and Republican governors alike have failed to put enough money into the pension system going back to the late 1990s. The problem ballooned in the early 2000s when the dot-com bubble burst and tax revenues fell, and the Great Recession later in the decade did even more damage to state finances. Also, the state Legislature has been controlled by Democrats. But while the problem was created before he took office, Christie can’t sidestep at least some responsibility for what has taken place on his watch. Our ruling Brazile said that Chistie led New Jersey to a record-breaking nine credit downgrades. Her tally is correct, Christie was the chief executive throughout and no other New Jersey governor has overseen so many reductions in the state credit rating. The previous record was six. But the underlying problem with pensions began before his time and the economy made it harder to fix past errors. It's also worth noting that Democracts have controlled the Legislature during Christie's time in office. With those caveats, we rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BE4440>],/factchecks/2015/jul/02/donna-brazile/dem-pundit-brazile-says-nj-credit-rating-fell-reco/

Ted Kanavas says spending on private school vouchers makes up tiny piece of all education spending
","Amid the debate over whether to spend state money to expand the private school voucher program, a former state senator is arguing there is not all that much spent on the program. Republican Ted Kanavas made the comments during a face off with Democrat Chuck Chvala, another former state senator, in the June 12, 2015 episode of the WisPolitics online show, The Insider.   ""Chuck, this is going to be a great document at the end of the day,"" Kanavas said of the budget, which is stalled in the Legislature.   ""They're destroying public education,"" Chvala said of Republicans. ""You know, this is a fun segment, but you know, I can't tell you how much it hurts and how sad it is to see them destroy K-12 education."" ""Wrong, wrong, and wrong,"" Kanavas said.   One of his rebuttal points:   ""Less than 1 percent of all the education dollars that we spend are spent on private voucher programs."" For all the debate about the voucher program, could funding for it really make up such a small portion of spending?   Background Education is the largest line in the state's budget with $5.2 billion allocated in 2014-’15.    Wisconsin schools have three basic sources of revenue -- state aid, property taxes and federal funding. The proportion each source of aid makes up varies between school districts. A report from the Wisconsin Association of Schools Boards shows state aid and property taxes each providing about 40 to 45 percent of overall education funding in the state. Federal funding typically makes up 6 to 7 percent. Other sources of funding like ticket sales from sporting events and building rentals comprise the last small portion. The state’s school voucher program allows parents to take the government funds that would be used to educate their child to private school of their choice, including religious schools.   We've rated claims about spending on the program before. Opposing claims about per-pupil spending at public and voucher schools made by Gov. Scott Walker and state Rep. Sondy Pope in 2013 were both rated Half True because of the methods used for the comparisons.   So how much is really spent on voucher schools?   The numbers   When we reached out to Kanavas to provide support for his claim, he didn’t respond. But a report from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s nonpartisan scorekeeper, breaks down money allocated in the state budget in recent years. Here's a look at how much the state spent on voucher programs:   Fiscal year Choice school funding (in millions) 2011-12 $145.8 2012-13 $157.8 2013-14 $171.9 2014-15 $213 Kanavas was fairly general in his statement saying, ""education dollars that we spend."" But he spoke in the context of the Wisconsin budget, so let’s start there. By that measure, voucher spending makes up 3 to 4 percent in the last four fiscal years, not close to the ""less than one percent"" asserted by Kanavas.   What if we add in the local money that goes to schools through property taxes? After all, in recent years, the state has restricted property tax increases, so the two areas are connected. Fiscal year Percentage spent on voucher programs 2011-12 1.5% 2012-13 1.6% 2013-14 1.8% 2014-15 2.1% The percentage went down, but not enough to fall below 1 percent. Even if one were to take the most charitable approach to analyzing Kanavas’ claim -- by including money for the University of Wisconsin System, which could be lumped in as ""education dollars that we spend"" -- spending on voucher schools stays above 1 percent. But the essence of his argument holds up -- the state still targets the vast, vast majority of its education spending to public schools. Our rating Kanavas said, ""less than 1 percent of all the education dollars that we spend are spent on private voucher programs.""   While spending on voucher programs comprises a small fraction of the state education budget, it stays above the 1 percent mark.   We rate the claim Half True. Editor’s note: After this item was posted, School Choice Wisconsin President Jim Bender called our attention to two Legislative Fiscal Bureau memos. One sent to Assembly Minority Leader  Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, estimates $600 to $800 million would go toward the school voucher program over the next 10 years. Another memo, sent to Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, says that during the next decade, public schools would receive more than $94 billion of state and local funds. In this scenario, less than 1 percent would be spent on school voucher programs.  But in his statement, Kanavas spoke in the present tense, and made no mention of spending over a future decade. What’s more, none of those budgets have been approved and other factors could increase or reduce the figure. Our rating remains Half True.

Canadian hog farmers and Congress want to repeal a consumer labeling law. Here's why
","Thanks to a little-known congressional bill, it may soon be impossible to tell whether your Fourth of July burger is all-American Angus or beef imported from the Amazon, according to a Facebook meme. ""The House of Representatives just voted 300-131 to remove ‘country-of-origin labeling’ on chicken, pork, and beef sold in the United States,"" the meme says. ""Sorry but you don’t deserve to know where your meat is coming from."" What beef could the House possibly have with the consumer-friendly law? We looked into the vote in question and found an interesting story of international trade disputes, riled up Canadian hog farmers, and ""jingoist fears."" Meat of the matter  Under the country-of-origin labeling law, or COOL, supermarkets have to tell consumers where their meat, fish, and nuts are produced with varying degrees of specificity (i.e. ""Born in Canada, Slaughtered in the U.S."", ""Farm-Raised in Vietnam"", or simply a laundry list of all the countries the product has passed through). COOL passed in 2002 but wasn’t fully implemented until March 2009. By then, Canada already had a bone to pick with the law, saying it violated World Trade Organization agreements. A mandatory ""made-in"" stamp discriminated against foreign hog farmers and cattle ranchers and was too costly to boot, according to Canada. Joining Canada’s complaint were a long list of other countries. Between 2011 and 2015, the WTO ruled four times that COOL was inconsistent with trade agreements. The United States made several unsuccessful appeals, but eventually Canada and Mexico asked the WTO for permission to impose retaliatory tariffs totalling $3 billion. The WTO’s decision is pending. In May of 2015, House Agriculture Committee Chair K. Michael Conaway, R-Texas, introduced H.R. 2393, a bill to repeal the labeling requirements for ground and muscle cuts of beef and pork -- and threw in chicken for good measure. ""Retaliation by Canada and Mexico will soon become a reality, meaning economically devastating tariffs on a broad spectrum of U.S. exports,"" Conaway wrote in Roll Call. ""Ripple effects will be felt in nearly every industry, every state and every consumer’s wallet. This is why COOL for beef, pork and chicken — nothing more than a failed government experiment — must be repealed."" On June 10, the House passed the repeal bill by a not-entirely partisan vote of 300-131: a third of House Democrats voted in favor of the Republican-backed bill. Saving COOL’s bacon The meme’s wording implies that the country-of-origin labeling law’s fate is sealed, but that’s a bit hammed up. The bill now awaits the Senate’s and, ultimately, President Barack Obama’s approval. In the upper chamber, COOL repeal will be more of a battle. ""The politics are going to be much, much more difficult in the Senate,"" said Victoria Guida, a trade reporter for Politico. ""Part of the reason this passed the House so easily is because so many other industries, outside of the meat world, are freaked out about retaliation. But the Senate tends to be a little more big-picture about policies, and straight repeal is expected to have a tough time."" The Senate Agricultural Committee held hearings on June 25, where Chairman Pat Roberts, R-Kan., called for repeal. In lieu of completely getting rid of the labeling law, top Democrat, Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, proposed a voluntary labeling system supported by some Republicans but rejected by Conaway. We didn’t hear back from the White House about what the president plans to do if the bill reaches his desk. If the repeal is greenlit by both the Senate and the White House, country-of-origin still won’t be prohibited from meat packaging. As per Stabenow’s proposal, it could potentially mirror the USDA’s paid grading service of beef (i.e. ""prime choice"" and ""select""), though supporters say that’s not enough.   ""The (meat) industry has had plenty of time to do a COOL program, and they didn't. So we have mandatory COOL. That is the solution that provides consumers with what they’re demanding,"" Chris Waldrop of the Consumer Federation of America. What’s at 'steak' At its core, COOL is a consumer rights law, intended to help people make purchasing decisions -- be it supporting American ranchers or boycotting beef associated with Amazon deforestation. Yet it has provoked intense debate. While 90 percent of Americans want country-of-origin labeling, the interest doesn’t necessarily reflect in the dollars spent, says Jayson Lusk, an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University. ""Analysis of scanner data from grocery stores shows essentially no impact of (mandatory country-of-origin labeling) when buying meat,"" he said. ""Despite this, there are real and demonstrable costs to processors and retailers. Thus, the totality of evidence suggests that COOL does not pass a cost-benefit test."" Canada and Mexico have also argued that the labeling might make people think U.S. products are safer, even when experts say there is little evidence to support or refute that point. ""U.S. companies have been doing a marvelous job of poisoning us for years,"" said Bill Marler, a food-borne illness attorney and publisher of Food Safety News. He pointed out that Malaysia banned American apples earlier this year due to a listeria outbreak, and Mexico rejected Californian lettuce in 2006 after growers found E. coli on the crop. While Marler thinks COOL can feed ""jingoist fears,"" he nonetheless supports it, as he believes in greater transparency in the food system. Like Marler, 283 consumer, agricultural, environmental, labor, and faith-based groups say COOL is about empowering consumers. In a letter ultimately unheeded by Conaway, they urged the House to not bow to the standard scare tactics of trade partners. ""We shouldn't automatically repeal a law passed by Congress because an international trade tribunal tells us it violates trade law. We first need to look at other options aside from repeal,"" said Ben Lilliston of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, a sustainable farming advocacy group. He added that COOL laws exist around the world, and United States has willingly paid tariffs when it’s disagreed with past WTO rulings. ""Consumers have a legitimate interest in knowing where their food comes from,"" said Waldrop of the Consumer Federation of America. Our ruling ""The House of Representatives just voted 300-131 to remove ‘country-of-origin labeling’ on chicken, pork, and beef sold in the United States,"" according to a Facebook meme. The bill in question seeks to repeal mandatory country-of-origin labeling or COOL from ground and muscle cuts of chicken, pork, and beef. The House passed it in June this year with a 300-131 vote, after Canada and Mexico said the consumer rights law was unfair to foreign hog farmers and cattle ranchers and threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs. The Senate has yet to decide on the labeling law’s fate and, at this early stage, there has been support for making COOL voluntary. While country-of-origin labeling isn’t quite dead meat, the House voted for repeal.

No, undocumented immigrants are not tied to 50% of Texas murders
","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is standing by his sweeping and negative comments about Mexican immigrants. But the billionaire’s remarks at his campaign announcement speech have cost him: His show contract with NBC has been canceled, Mexico has withdrawn from the Miss Universe contest Trump cosponsors, and Macy’s announced it will stop selling Trump-branded menswear. Trump blamed the media for taking his remarks out of context. His reference to rapists and drug dealers referred to a failed immigration policy, not all Mexicans he said. But the blowback aside, Trump has his ardent supporters. Count Gavin McInnes among them. The flamboyant and purposefully politically incorrect talker appeared on Fox News to defend Trump. In a conversation on The Greg Gutfeld Show, McInnes called Trump an ""awesome guy"" who ""ought to be revered."" McInnes said the media was wrong to brush off Trump’s assertions. ""He just said a bunch of hate facts,"" McInnes said. ""The crime rate with illegals is through the roof."" When Gutfeld pressed McInnes to give some facts of his own, McInnes delivered one. ""50 percent of murders in Texas have been linked to illegal aliens,"" he said. ""Is that a fact?"" Gutfeld asked. ""I don’t know."" We can resolve that uncertainty. No, it isn’t a fact. Hard data The Texas Department of Public Safety has pretty good data on any non-U.S. citizen who is arrested for a crime in Texas. That group includes both people living in the United States legally, and people living here illegally. Unfortunately, Texas doesn’t break down the number of murder charges and convictions by group (legal non-U.S. citizen vs. illegal non-U.S. citizen). But Texas officials say that from June 2011 through May 2015, 67 percent of non-U.S. citizens found guilty of any crime ""were identified by DHS status as being in the U.S. illegally at the time of their last arrest."" According to Texas’ data, authorities charged 872 non-U.S. citizens for murder between June 2011 and May 2015, of which 337 were convicted. If the 67 percent figure were to hold, that would mean unauthorized immigrants would have been charged with 584 murders; 226 of which would have ended in a conviction. How does that compare to the total number of homicides in Texas? The official homicide figure for 2014 has yet to be released, but we do have the numbers for 2011 through 2013. (These totals are for calendar years, while the state’s tally of arrests of non-U.S. citizens starts midway through 2011.) This is where McInnes’ claim falls apart. There were 3,384 homicides in Texas for the three years between 2011 and 2013, compared to an estimated 584 murder charges involving undocumented immigrants over a period stretching nearly four years. That’s nowhere near half, despite counting an additional year of murder charges involving undocumented immigrants. And the gap between his claim and the data gets bigger if you look at the actual convictions of undocumented immigrants. McInnes’ claim remains wrong even if you count every non-U.S. citizen murder charge, all 872 cases. (July 1, 2015, update: A couple of hours after we published this fact-check we noticed that the Texas Department of Public Safety had updated its numbers to include June 2015. The changes were tiny. Homicide arrests went from 872 to 879, and the convictions went from 337 to 344. Again, this included arrests and convictions of legal and illegal immigrants. The percentage of undocumented immigrants changed from 67 percent to 66 percent. The changes do not affect our analysis.) Fuzzy data We contacted McInnes on Twitter and he directed us to an excerpt from Ann Coulter’s latest book Adios America. (He also noted that ""Putting ‘fact’ in your URL doesn't make you right, dingbat,"" but as they say, sticks and stones, and so forth.) Coulter, in her book, does talk about undocumented immigrants and murders in Texas, but she doesn’t actually say that they committed 50 percent of the homicides there. Actually, she was lambasting a 2014 fact-check by our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas examining a claim that in a seven-year period, illegal aliens were responsible for 3,000 murders. Fact-checkers rated the claim Pants on Fire because the figure was based on arrests, not convictions, and included people who were in the country legally. It included a quote from Northeastern University criminologist Ramiro Martinez, who did some back-of-the-envelope math and estimated that if Perry were right, undocumented immigrants were behind 46 percent of the murders. Martinez said that made no sense.   ""It just boggles the imagination that level of ‘aliens’ were involved to that extent over time and nobody noticed,"" Martinez said. For Coulter, this proved her point that the government and the media intentionally fail to collect and report data on crimes by illegal immigrants. ""Strictly speaking, boggling the mind of a professor is not data,"" Coulter wrote. ""Martinez asked how so many illegal immigrants could be committing murder and ‘nobody noticed.’ It might be easier to ‘notice’ if we weren’t prohibited from noticing."" Our ruling McInnes said that 50 percent of murders in Texas have been linked to illegal aliens. The source of this stat ultimately tracks back to a criminologist who used it as a way to debunk a claim, not because he thinks it’s valid. Current data from the Texas Department of Public Safety show that undocumented immigrants are not associated with 50 percent of murder charges or convictions. McInnes’ statement is a mighty exaggeration. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A422C0>],/factchecks/2015/jul/01/gavin-mcinnes/no-undocumented-immigrants-are-not-tied-50-texas-m/

Ted Cruz says Supreme Court on same-sex marriage is out of step with public, but polls don’t agree
","The Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide isn’t what the American people wanted, says Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Cruz, who is running for president, is an outspoken critic of the court’s 5-4 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that overturned the country’s remaining same-sex marriage bans. In an interview on Morning Edition June 29, NPR’s Steve Inskeep talked with Cruz about how he and other Republicans will respond. ""The concern of conservatives seems to be that the court was following public opinion,"" Inskeep said. ""Same-sex marriage, for example, is much more popular than it used to be."" Cruz responded, ""Well, Steve, let me actually disagree with your premise. The court doesn't follow public opinion. The court’s views are radically out of step with public opinion."" ""If the values had changed so much, there would be no need for the court to act because people would have acted democratically to change their marriage laws,"" Cruz added. ""That hadn't happened, which is why the court stepped in and (threw) out the laws that the people did adopt."" Given the swelling support for same-sex marriage in recent years, we wanted to dig into Cruz’s claim that ""the court’s views are radically out of step with public opinion."" To be clear: The claim could be interpreted as speaking about the court’s decisions generally. But given the context of the statement and our interaction with Cruz’s campaign, it seems he was talking about same-sex marriage specifically, so that’s what we’ll focus on. There’s a couple of different ways to look at this, but Cruz’s characterization is an exaggeration. A look at the polls On whether the American public supports same-sex marriage, there is no question. Numerous 2015 polls have found that a majority of the country -- around 60 percent -- favors same-sex marriage. The majority holds in most demographic groups. Support for same-sex marriage has risen dramatically in the past few years, as demonstrated by this Gallup chart, spanning 20 years:  But there’s another question that doesn’t have a clear answer -- whether Americans think the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should have been left to the states, rather than having a decision made at the national level. This is essentially the question presented to the Supreme Court. Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips said ""it is incontrovertible that a majority of Americans believe that the decision should be left to the states,"" pointing to a February 2015 CBS News poll that found 56 percent of Americans hold this position. However, other polls show the opposite: that a majority of Americans think same-sex marriage should be decided nationally. A June 2015 poll by CBS News and the New York Times found that just 41 percent of Americans think this is a state issue, while 54 percent think there should be a single federal law. Looking through a collection of the latest polls on gay rights, neither side stands out as the obvious position of the American public. Given the mix of polling results on this question, ""it's not the case that the court's ruling was, as Cruz claimed, ‘radically out of step with public opinion.’ Rather, Americans were less definitive on this aspect of the gay marriage issue than others,"" said New York University professor Patrick Egan, who studies public opinion and gay rights issues. Phillips noted that a majority of states had laws banning same-sex marriage prior to this year’s Supreme Court and earlier lower court decisions -- more than 30 state bans in 2013, before the rulings started to roll out. Because state legislatures or the voters directly passed these laws, Phillips said they ""reflected the popular will of the people in those states."" But timing is important here. These same-sex marriage bans might have reflected popular opinion at the time they were passed -- nearly all came about before 2010 -- but public opinion on gay marriage has changed significantly since then. ""If public opinion is changing -- and the data show it was -- it is possible for both the original legislative decisions and the subsequent court decisions to be consistent with public opinion,"" said Peter Enns, a professor of government at Cornell University who studies public opinion and government response. By 2014, at least 50 percent of residents in 32 states supported same-sex marriage -- including quite a few states that had gay marriage bans prior to court decisions, according to the Public Religion Research Institute. A majority opposed same-sex marriage in only eight states. Additionally, most political scientists would say public opinion is best measured via representative surveys, not by the laws currently in place, Egan noted. So it’s not always fair to say that an existing same-sex marriage ban shows that the people of that state are currently opposed to same-sex marriage legalization. Our ruling Cruz said the Supreme Court’s views ""are radically out of step with public opinion"" regarding its decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide. Most polls say around 60 percent favor same-sex marriage -- a high point. At the state level, the majority holds in most cases. Cruz’s staff said that Americans think legalizing same-sex marriage should be a state responsibility rather than something decided at the federal level. But different polls show different results on that point. There isn’t an obvious majority one way or the other. Certainly there is a good chunk of the population that opposes the Supreme Court’s decision, but it’s definitely not a clear majority. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C078E80>],/factchecks/2015/jul/01/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-out-/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Jeb Bush']","
Which presidential candidate has released the most tax returns in history?
","Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush released 33 years of tax returns, casting it as the high water mark of transparency for presidential hopefuls. ""Today, I’m releasing 33 years of tax returns – more than any presidential candidate in history,"" Bush said on his website. He also bragged about it on Twitter. The returns run from 1981 to 2013. We wondered if Bush’s 33 years was indeed the most ever, and that does appear to be the case. We also found it’s highly unusual for a candidate to share so many returns, especially so early in the campaign. The previous record was held by Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., who won the Republican nomination to run against President Bill Clinton in 1996. In January of that year, Dole released 29 years of tax returns, stretching from 1966 to 1994. He added 1995 in April, for a grand total of 30 years. Most of Dole’s ire at the time was directed at primary rival, publisher Steve Forbes, who was reticent about revealing his finances. Dole took the opportunity to rebuke his opponent for pushing for a flat tax. The next highest number of releases was Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who released a total of 20 years of returns: five years worth of returns in April 2004, adding to 15 years of returns he had revealed in prior Senate races. Critics of Kerry’s campaign were more concerned that his independently wealthy wife, millionaire Teresa Heinz Kerry, wouldn’t give out her returns. (She eventually provided two pages of her 2003 return.) There is no law requiring candidates to show their tax returns, but it has become common practice since Jimmy Carter became president in 1976. The releases have been far from uniform, however, down to when candidates make their returns public. Bush is an outlier for providing so many returns so early in the campaign, as the lion’s share of candidates usually wait until the year of the election to give out their information. The amount of documentation also has varied widely from person to person. George Romney released 12 years in 1968, as did Bill Clinton in 1992. Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., gave out 10 when he was Kerry’s running mate in 2004. The numbers then dwindle, from George W. Bush (nine in 2000) and Al Gore (eight the same year) to Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., and Hillary Clinton, who both released seven in 2008. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Mitt Romney both released two years during their campaigns. In 1980, Ronald Reagan only provided one. Releasing tax information is often a part of campaign strategy, usually to force other candidates to reveal their finances. But even then, the move can draw criticism. Liberal political action committee American Bridge 21st Century posted a laundry list of questions about the former Florida governor’s business dealings on the same day he released his returns. Bush’s 1,150 pages of financial documents show that the former real estate executive’s net worth dropped from about $2 million to $1.3 million during his two terms as governor. The campaign said he is currently worth between $19 million and $22 million. He has earned at least $29 million since leaving office in 2007. Our ruling Bush said his release of 33 years of tax returns is ""more than any presidential candidate in history."" That really is the case. The next highest total by a presidential candidate is from Dole, who released 30 years’ worth during his 1996 presidential campaign. We rate Bush’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097890F80>],/factchecks/2015/jul/01/jeb-bush/which-presidential-candidate-has-released-most-tax/

Donna Howard says Texas No. 1 in uninsured residents across the board
","An Austin legislator stressed the number of Texans who lack health coverage after applauding the U.S. Supreme Court for upholding federal subsidies under the Obamacare law. On a positive note, Democratic state Rep. Donna Howard said in a June 25, 2015, press release that the share of uninsured Texans has decreased thanks to more people buying insurance, some with help from the subsidies written into Affordable Care Act of 2010. Now, she said, the Republican-led state should act to draw more federal money to insure more residents—perhaps a reference to Texas’ refusal so far to expand Medicaid to more adults with the federal government initially picking up costs.   Inaction, Howard said, ""has only left Texas with the nation's highest rate and highest number of uninsured.""   Whatever the reasons, does Texas lead the nation in its uninsurance rate and its count of uninsured residents?   That wasn’t so before. In 2013, we rated Mostly False a declaration by Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, that Texas had the nation’s most uninsured people, 6 million. As of 2011, then the latest year of survey data, Texas led the nation with its 24 percent share of uninsured residents. But more-populous California was home to about 1 million more uninsured residents.   Also in 2013, we found True a claim that Texas had the most uninsured children. In 2012. According to federal survey results, Texas ranked first nationally with 1.1 million uninsured children, followed by California with 891,000.   California is among states, unlike Texas, that expanded Medicaid access in accord with the Obamacare law. It stands to reason its uninsured population consequently shrunk. Another post-2013 factor: Key provisions of the Obamacare law—including the mandate that most Americans obtain coverage and the offer of subsidies for individuals to buy insurance—took effect in 2014, likely affecting who has a policy.   Texas No. 1 in rate of uninsured   Texas has evidently continued to rank No. 1 for its share of uninsured residents.   To our inquiry, Scott Daigle, Howard’s chief of staff, noted by email a June 23, 2015, Austin American-Statesman story citing a national survey by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating Texas had a higher percentage of uninsured adults in 2014 than any other state. Nearly 26 percent of Texas adults were uninsured, the story said, down from about 28 percent in 2013.   We wondered about all residents of the states at issue. Separately, the Kaiser Family Foundation, drawing on U.S. Census Bureau survey results, keeps up with how many residents of each state have health coverage. Its latest charts indicate that per the bureau’s 2013 Current Population Survey, Texas and Nevada were tied for No. 1 that year with 20 percent of residents lacking coverage. At the time, according to the survey, 15 percent of California residents lacked coverage. In raw numbers, 5,769,600 Californians were uninsured, compared with 5,357,700 Texans, according to the survey.   We also reached out to bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein who suggested by email we consider its American Community Survey results for 2013, the latest available, indicating 22 percent of Texans and 17 percent of Californians were uninsured that year. According to this survey, Nevada had the nation’s No. 2 uninsurance rate, nearly 21 percent. In raw numbers, the survey suggested, 6.5 million Californians lacked coverage compared to more than 5.7 million Texans.   California vs. Texas in uninsured residents   In question: Whether California kept its raw-total lead in uninsured residents through 2014.   Doesn’t seem so, experts told us, because far fewer Californians continued to lack coverage through the year, causing Texas to end up No. 1 for its uninsured rate and total residents without insurance. However, we fell short of landing governmental confirmation of such a shift.   Responding to our request for backup information, Daigle in Howard’s office emailed us a link to a September 2014 Rice University press release stating Texas ""has now surpassed California to become the state with the highest number of uninsured residents."" But the related report, from Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy and the Episcopal Health Foundation, said only that Texas has ""potentially surpassed"" California in its uninsured count.   According to quarterly surveys of Texans undertaken by the researchers, an additional nearly 379,000 Texans aged 18 to 64 had health coverage after the first Obamacare enrollment period, reducing uninsurance rates among such adults from 25 percent in September 2013 to 22 percent in May 2014.   An April 2015 follow-up report by the institute and foundation said that thanks to more adults obtaining coverage, the share of uninsured Texans aged 18-64 as of March 2015 had dropped even more to 17 percent. The report said: ""Despite this progress, Texas remains the state with the highest percentage of uninsured residents and, for the first time, Texas now has the largest number of uninsured residents.""   That report did not say how the researchers decided California no longer had the most uninsured. By email to our inquiry, co-author Elena Marks told us an undated web post on Wallethub.com, a personal finance website, fueled the conclusion. After the Obamacare law took effect, she noted, WalletHub projected that 14.26 percent of Californians and 24.81 percent of Texans lacked coverage. WalletHub also said its estimates were limited to beneficiaries under 64 years of age.   Those state-by-state percentages, according to WalletHub’s post, were calculated in part from a June 2014 Kaiser Family Foundation look into insurance sign-ups during the first Obamacare enrollment period, which WalletHub described as ""the best estimate to date of the proportion of private health plan enrollees under Obamacare who previously lacked health insurance and therefore would be gaining coverage under the new law.""   Marks told us the Texas researchers multiplied the WalletHub projections by each state’s population to estimate that more than 6.8 million Texans and 5.5 million Californians were uninsured once the Obamacare law had rolled into place.   Other analysts   Seeking other perspectives, we queried experts including Paul Fronstin of the Washington, D.C.-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, which says its mission is to enhance the development of public policy through objective research and education.   In 2012, Fronstin wrote that the year  before, California had the largest number of people under age 65 without health insurance of any state, at 7.1 million. But he also wrote that with Obamacare taking effect, the western state’s share of uninsured adults would likely drop. As it was, Fronstin told us at the time, his analysis of bureau research released in March 2012 showed more Californians than Texans were lacking coverage.   That also held in Fronstin’s latest analysis, published in 2013, which said that nationally in 2010-12, Texas and California were among 14 states with 20 percent or more of residents lacking insurance. California had an average of 7 million uninsured non-elderly residents, according to a chart in the report, outpacing other states including No. 2 Texas, which averaged 6.1 million uninsured non-elderly.   Still, those counts reflected conditions before the Obamacare law took fuller effect. By email, Fronstin told us this month that he believes California no longer leads the nation in uninsured residents, likely due to more people there taking advantage of coverage options thanks to the state expanding Medicaid and residents otherwise buying insurance with the subsidies offered thanks to the Obamacare law.   Fronstin pointed out Gallup polls taken through 2014 indicating Texas that year had the nation’s greatest share of uninsured adults (24.4 percent) for the seventh straight year. That was a slight improvement from the 27 percent rate Gallup gauged in 2013. From 2013 to 2014, per Gallup’s results, California’s adult uninsurance rate fell from 21.6 percent to 15.3 percent.   We considered multiplying the 2014 Gallup percentages by federal population estimates to approximate the number of uninsured adults in each state.   But Howard referred to all uninsured residents. We sought the same broad focus.   On this front, Anne Dunkelberg of the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving low-income Texans, guided us to a June 23, 2015, report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating that according to its surveys undertaken through 2014, 11.5 percent of all Americans were uninsured.   Also, a chart in the report indicates 19.4 percent of all Texans were uninsured at the time they were interviewed while 12 percent of Californians reported no coverage. We multiplied these percentages over July 2014 Census Bureau population estimates for each state, reaching estimates of 5.23 million uninsured Texans in 2014 and 4.66 million uninsured Californians. Next, we reached Gerald ""Jerry"" Kominski, director of UCLA’s Center for Health Policy Research, who said by phone that results of its 2014 survey indicating the number of uninsured Californians at that time were to be released later this summer. Kominski otherwise said our calculation using the CDC study and federal population estimates seemed reasonable. ""California has been very successful in reducing the number of uninsured,"" Kominski said, ""because of its aggressive promotion of the Affordable Care Act."" We also ran our calculation by the Kaiser foundation. Researcher Rachel Garfield cautioned by phone against reaching conclusions by making calculations using figures from different sources. Generally, she said, data is not yet available to assess how many people were uninsured in each state in 2014 though the census bureau is expected to release relevant survey results in September 2015. Our ruling   Howard said Texas is No. 1 in its uninsurance rate and its total uninsured residents.   Texas leads the nation in its percentage of uninsured. Also, it newly looks like Texas has the greatest raw number of uninsured residents, though that’s evidently backed up only by rough calculations like our own, a clarification missing from this claim.   We rate Howard’s claim Mostly True.

MoveOn.Org says Ron Johnson voted to cut $700 million from Medicare
","Medicare has long been considered one of the third-rail issues of politics. Touch it, and the chances of recovery are slim. So it should be no surprise that political rivals depict their opponents as being on the wrong side of a high-voltage issue like Medicare funding. MoveOn.org, a political organizing group that endorsed Democrat Russ Feingold in May, put it bluntly June 11, 2015  in a Facebook post about U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the man Feingold hopes to unseat in 2016: ""Senator Johnson just voted to cut $700m from Medicare."" Below the headline, the post indicated the cuts were part of a vote on legislation to give President Barack Obama additional latitude to negotiate trade deals. Let's start at the beginning. Medicare and international trade?  The Trans-Pacific Partnership, which aims to open trade between the United States and several countries, including Chile,  Singapore, New Zealand, Vietnam, Canada and Mexico, would leave some American workers unemployed as a result of the increased competition from abroad. To compensate for that, a second bill would temporarily reinstate a program called Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA, to help retrain and provide temporary benefits to those who become unemployed because of the trade measure.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would cost $2.7 billion between 2015 and 2025. The cost of the program would be offset with user fees, cuts to tax credits, changing where Medicare recipients get some kidney treatments and a $700 million reduction to Medicare’s budget a decade from now, in 2025. Johnson was one of 62 senators who voted for the legislation, which the House passed June 25, 2015, sending it to Obama. For his part, Johnson argues it is not a cut at all. ""The senator feels MoveOn’s statement is patently false,"" his communications director Melinda Schnell wrote in an email.   A closer look With a budget of $505 billion in Fiscal Year 2014, Medicare is the federal government’s second-largest program, behind only Social Security. Between 2016 and 2025, the federal government is expected to spend a total of $7.3 trillion on Medicare. And the program is expected to grow -- even when the $700 million reduction is factored in. In 2025, when the $700 million budget reduction would go into effect, the federal government is expected to spend $981 billion on Medicare. Johnson's campaign points to a budget projection from the Congressional Budget Office that estimates what the federal government spends on Medicare will grow by 13.3 percent, or $115 billion, between 2024 and 2025. Even with a $700 million reduction, spending on the program will grow by about $114 billion, or 13.2 percent between 2024 and 2025. In other words, spending will increase, just by a smaller amount. The shoe was on the other foot in 2014, when Republicans argued that Democrats who voted for the Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare -- voted for a $700 billion cut to Medicare.   PolitiFact National checked numerous variations of that statement, rating them Half True of Mostly False, depending on how they were worded.   The Affordable Care Act reduced the expansion of Medicare by $700 billion over 10 years, while still allowing Medicare to grow. It just grew at a slower rate than it would have without the law. That's essentially what is happening here. The twist (and a primary source of complaint): In the new scenario, the Medicare money would go toward something not related to health care. Our rating Moveon.org criticized Johnson, saying he voted to cut $700 million from Medicare. But the $700 million budget reduction would not go into effect until 2025 and to say Medicare is being cut when it is still expected to grow by hundreds of billions of dollars is misleading at best. Our definition of Mostly False is ""The statement contain some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A7C4C0>],/factchecks/2015/jul/01/moveon/moveonorg-says-ron-johnson-voted-cut-700-million-m/

South Carolina, Georgia, 3 other states don't have hate crimes laws
","The U.S. Justice Department is weighing whether to bring a federal hate crimes charge in the June 17 church massacre in Charleston. The announcement has put the spotlight on the lack of a state-level law in South Carolina, as well as in a handful of other states. News media outlets, including Newsweek, and National Public Radio, have reported that South Carolina is one of only five states without a hate crimes law. PolitiFact Georgia decided to dig deeper into the claim. First, a little background. The FBI defines a hate crime as a traditional offense, such as murder, arson or vandalism, with the added element that the motivation is a bias based on race, religion, disability, ethnic origin or sexual orientation. Nearly 6,000 hate crimes were reported by law enforcement agencies in 2013, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. In Charleston, authorities seemed fairly confident from the beginning that the mass shooting at historically black Emanuel A.M.E. Church was a hate crime. At a press conference on June 18, shellshocked city officials met with reporters to discuss the nine deaths and announce the arrest of suspect Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old high school dropout and sometimes construction worker who is white. ""We believe this is a hate crime; that is how we are investigating it,"" Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said. According to news reports, witnesses claim Roof told victims before shooting them, ""You are raping our women and taking over our country."" Roof also reportedly said after his arrest that he been out to start a ""race war."" On June 18, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced the Justice Department had opened a federal hate crimes investigation into the church shootings, which she termed a ""barbaric crime."" In media reports that followed, South Carolina, Arkansas, Wyoming, Indiana and Georgia -- were identified as five states out of 50 without hate crimes law. Steven M. Freeman, legal affairs director for the Anti-Defamation League, arguably the biggest advocacy group for these laws, said the list is accurate. But it’s clearly complicated. Newsweek first reported five states without hate crimes laws, then later revised its report to show only three states, Georgia, Arkansas and South Carolina. Michigan provided PolitiFact a copy of its hate crimes law, countering some reports that it belonged on the no-law list with Georgia. State hate crime laws can vary widely. Some are specific only to sexual orientation, while others address biases related to race and gender. Freeman said hate crime prosecution is best left to the states, since most crimes are investigated by state or local police. The federal hate crime law, he said, is meant as ""a backstop."" The federal hate crimes law has enhanced penalties for various crimes, as do most state laws of this nature. The filing of a federal hate crime charge in the Charleston church slayings could be viewed as largely symbolic since Roof is already charged with nine counts of murder, and South Carolina’s governor has called for the death penalty. Georgia unique Unlike South Carolina and the other three states, Georgia did have a hate crimes law. The Georgia General Assembly passed a hate crime bill in 2000 calling for enhanced prison sentences if a person or a person's property were victimized ""because of bias or prejudice."" The bill, sponsored by state Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta, was thrown out as ""unconstitutionally vague"" in 2004 by the Georgia Supreme Court. It did not specifically outlaw crimes committed based on specific biases, related to a victim’s race, religion, ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual orientation, as laws in other states did. Fort has tried since the 2004 ruling to pass another hate crimes bill, but has been unsuccessful. He said last week that he will try to build on the momentum of Charleston and push for passage of a new law next year. Charleston brings home the point he was trying to make in 1999 when he first introduced Georgia’s bill, that a hate crime is ""terrorism and terrorism is different,"" Fort said. ""It ultimately is designed to intimidate, not just one person, but an entire group,"" he said. ""That is an important lesson out of Charleston. Hate crimes are terrorism.""What this man did in that church is nothing less than terrorism."" Like Fort, Charleston lawmakers have said they are renewing their efforts to establish a South Carolina hate crimes law. Jeannine Bell, a professor of law at Indiana University at Bloomington and a nationally recognized scholar on the topic of hate crimes, said state hate crime laws are effective, but not for the reason most people think. ""They are not needed to address hate murders like what occurred in Charleston,"" Bell said. ""Hate murders are relatively rare."" The vast majority of hate crimes are low- level crimes that, but for hate crime legislation would not even be investigated by the police, let alone prosecuted, she said. The hate crime legislation provides a way to punish crimes that extremely traumatize the victim and community, Bell said. She said she believes there is a stigma attached to states without any form of hate crime legislation. ""It may not be as significant as the stigma attached to those states that fly the Confederate battle flag,"" Bell said. ""But my question, as a scholar in this area is: ‘Why wouldn’t a state enact legislation that addresses extreme acts of bias directed at its citizens?’ I cannot see any downsides to the legislation."" Some civil libertarians see ""slipper slope"" But hate crime laws do raise concerns for some. Jonathan Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School, said the biggest concern is the threat to free speech as more speech is declared hate speech. He points to Europe and Canada as prime examples of prime examples of the dangers of expansive definitions of hate speech. ""Unless carefully defined, these laws can place societies on a slippery slope of speech regulation,"" Turley said. ""Since there are already laws criminalizing threats and related crimes, civil libertarians have always cautioned legislators about the implications and necessity of such laws."" Our ruling Attorney General Loretta Lynch has opened an investigation to determine whether a federal hate crimes charge should be brought in the mass church shooting in Charleston. This is in the absence of a state hate crimes law in South Carolina. The tragedy has drawn attention South Carolina, Georgia and three others identified as the only ones without state-level hate crime laws. The Anti-Defamation League, which has arguably been the biggest advocate of these laws, says research backs up that there are five states in this category..

Gingrich: Amazon removed educational board games about the Civil War
","Businesses, like government, are reacting to calls to remove the Confederate battle flag. Walmart announced June 22 that it would stop selling items with the flag. Major retailers quickly followed suit, including giants like Google, Amazon.com, eBay, Etsy, Sears and Target. But some say business has gone too far. Newt Gingrich voiced his displeasure on Meet the Press June 28. Gingrich criticized Amazon for removing ""an educational game about Gettysburg, which is used widely in schools to teach people to think."" ""(The game) has a Confederate versus an American flag, and therefore they've taken the game out of Amazon,"" Gingrich said. ""There's a point here where we begin to get towards Orwell's memory hole, in which we try to hide from the past. I think it's one thing to say you should not have a symbol which is very offensive to a large part of your population. It's another thing to say, 'Let's erase our history and pretend it never occurred.’ "" We wondered: Has Amazon removed educational Civil War games in its sweep to stop selling the Confederate battle flag? Neither Gingrich nor Gingrich’s spokesman mentioned the specific names of any games, so we decided to do a bit of digging on our own. PunditFact found several articles that seemed to indicate that Amazon had indeed pulled various board games depicting the Civil War from its online market. An article published on June 25 in the Daily Caller -- three days prior to Gingrich’s claim -- listed several removed games and included links to those presumably missing. These games included Battle Cry, The Guns of Gettysburg and Civil War Stratego, all of which display the Confederate battle flag in one form or another. However, an update to the article on June 26 reads that Amazon had ""restored Battle Cry’s listing, though The Guns of Gettysburg and Civil War Stratego remain unavailable."" When PunditFact first accessed the article on June 28, all the games mentioned had been restored on Amazon. PunditFact contacted Amazon several times hoping to learn what games had been removed, for how long and why, but did not hear back. Point being: It appears some games were initially removed, according to news articles, but they all since have been restored to the online marketplace. Gingrich spokesman Ross Worthington, who edits Gingrich’s online e-newsletter, said Gingrich misspoke. Gingrich ""was referring to Apple's removal of ... apps from the app store,"" Worthington said. Like other companies, Apple is reviewing apps that contain Confederate battle flag imagery. ""(Apple has) removed apps from the App Store that use the Confederate flag in offensive or mean-spirited ways, which is in violation of our guidelines. We are not removing apps that display the Confederate flag for educational or historical uses,"" an Apple spokeswoman told CNN. Other articles also reflect that approved apps are in the process of getting restored. Our ruling Gingrich said that an ""educational game about Gettysburg"" has been removed by Amazon for depicting a Confederate battle flag. From what PunditFact could find, it appears Amazon did initially remove several board games that depicted the flag, but on the day that Gingrich made the statement, all those games had been restored. Amazon and other companies say they intend to remove products that ""can promote or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual or religious intolerance"" and/or ""expose the targeted group to harm or violence."" Gingrich’s claim is partially accurate, but also a bit out of date.

Florida Dems say tuition went up 48.2 percent in Jeb Bush era
","Former Gov. Jeb Bush likes to advertise education reforms during his two terms in office, but the Florida Democratic Party wants to remind voters those changes came at a price. In a joint press release with the Texas Democratic Party ahead of a fundraising visit to the Lone Star state, Democrats compared Bush to fellow presidential hopeful Rick Perry, the former Texas governor. In a chart listing dubious gubernatorial achievements, Dems said Bush ""oversaw (an) average in-state tuition increase of 48.2 percent during his tenure."" Did public university tuition go up by almost 50 percent in eight years during Bush’s two terms? That number is more or less correct, but there’s more to the Bush-era education overhaul than that. Higher-cost education Before we dive into the convoluted tuition-setting process, keep in mind that Florida’s governor does not set tuition rates, the Legislature does. The governor does sign off on the rate in the final budget, and can veto an increase. But the Florida Democratic Party said he ""oversaw"" the increases, so we need to keep that wording in mind. When Bush took office, the State University System was governed by the Board of Regents, which was designed to protect university interests and often fought with legislators over how money was spent at schools. One of those battles led Bush to work with then-Speaker of the House John Thrasher and the Legislature to dissolve the Board of Regents in 2000. The Regents’ duties were turned over to the state Board of Education and a governor-appointed Board of Trustees at each university. But that system soon added the current Board of Governors, created when U.S. Sen. Bob Graham (also a former governor)  masterminded a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2002. Now let’s get down to the numbers. Florida Democratic Party officials didn’t elaborate on their claim for us, but they did include a link in their press release to back up their point. A chart from the Florida College Access Network, a student advocacy group, showed average in-state, undergraduate tuition and fees for students taking 30 credit hours at State University System schools over a number of years. Doing the math from that source, we found that the percent change of the systemwide average from the 1999-2000 fiscal year (Bush’s first year in office) through 2006-07 (when he left) really was 48.2 percent. This is the number the Florida Democratic Party is likely using. 1999-2000 2006-07 Percent change $2,170.98 $3,217.65 48.2 percent   But this is PolitiFact, so you know we found more to the numbers than that. Things get a little complicated because Florida’s fiscal year starts in July, while governors are inaugurated in January. That means there’s some overlap in which a new governor is working with his predecessor’s budget for six months. If we’re really going to compare tuition numbers, we should start with the fiscal year that started before Bush took office in January 1999 to establish the baseline for what tuition was when he began his first term. If we look at it that way, the percent change is even higher. 1998-99 2006-07 Percent change $2,061.75 $3,217.65 56 percent   We also need to keep in mind that these College Access Network totals are averages for all the universities in the system, with tuition and fees reported together -- a common measurement because fees are mandatory. But to get an accurate count, we have to split tuition and fees, because some fees can vary from school to school. Neither the governor nor the Legislature set fees. That’s up to the Board of Governors (and the Regents before them), which has final say over fee hikes. We asked the Board of Governors for the systemwide tuition rates for the time frame we’re looking at, to see what the actual rate of tuition increases were. They are reported by credit hour, but the rate of change is still easy to calculate: 1998-99 2006-07 Percent change $46.99 per credit hour $73.71 per credit hour 56.9 percent   So Bush oversaw a tuition increase of almost 60 percent. Whether that’s a lot in relative terms is a different matter. His campaign pointed out undergraduate students saw an average annual increase of about $145 with a full load of classes. A Bush spokeswoman also said his successors have raised tuition at a higher rate than that, which we’ve dealt with in other fact-checks. We can look at a couple of nationwide measures, again reported in tuition and fees, which can give us a rough idea of how much costs were going up across the country while Bush was in office. The National Center for Education Statistics shows that between 1998-99 and 2006-07, in-state undergraduate tuition at four-year public institutions went up more than 75 percent. The College Board, which uses NCES data in part to come up with its figures, puts that at about 72.7 percent. Florida universities have historically had low in-state undergraduate tuition rates, with the biggest increases passed off on out-of-state residents and graduate students. The College Board’s annual Trends in College Pricing report showed that when Bush left office, public universities in Florida charged the least among all 50 states for in-state, undergraduate tuition. Only Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia averaged less in 2006-07. Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said Bush ""oversaw average in-state tuition increase of 48.2 percent during his tenure."" While not having the power to increase tuition himself, Bush did sign budgets in which the Legislature increased tuition substantially. We came up with 56.9 percent ourselves, counting the strict cost of tuition per hour over the eight years Bush was governor. That hike doesn’t beat estimates of the nationwide average at the time, however, and in-state, undergraduate tuition was still quite a deal compared to other states when Bush left office. The statement is accurate, but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097035AC0>],/factchecks/2015/jun/30/florida-democratic-party/florida-dems-say-tuition-went-482-percent-jeb-bush/

Mitt Romney says “redistribution” has “never been a characteristic of America”
","
After getting criticized for saying that 47 percent of Americans are ""dependent on government"" and ""believe the government has a responsibility to care for them,"" Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign fired back by accusing President Barack Obama of supporting redistribution of wealth. 
First, a 1998 tape of Obama surfaced in which he said, in part, ""I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody's got a shot."" 
Then, Romney brought up the topic during a Sept. 19, 2012, appearance in Atlanta. 
Romney said that Obama ""really believes in what I’ll call a government-centered society,"" according to an account in POLITICO. ""I know there are some who believe that if you simply take from some and give to others then we’ll all be better off. It’s known as redistribution. It’s never been a characteristic of America. There’s a tape that came out just a couple of days ago where the president said yes he believes in redistribution. I don’t. I believe the way to lift people and help people have higher incomes is not to take from some and give to others but to create wealth for all."" 
Romney continued, ""This idea of redistribution follows from the idea that if you have a business you didn’t build it, someone else did that. It’s the same concept. … The government is responsible for everything that’s gone on here. And therefore government can take and give as it chooses. It’s an entirely foreign concept that will not work, that has not worked. That has never worked anywhere in the world. And what we have to do in America is not to make us more like Europe, but to make America more like America...."" 
We wondered whether Romney was correct to say that ""redistribution"" has ""never been a characteristic of America."" So we checked with historians and economists. Most agreed that Romney was ignoring the fundamental structure of the nation's progressive tax system, which has been redistributing wealth for a century, as well as a host of other policies, some of which predate the nation’s founding. 
A progressive tax system is one that takes a larger share of the income of high-income earners than it does from low-income individuals. Since this revenue is spent on government programs -- which benefit people other than just the taxpayer whose income is taken -- a progressive tax system is essentially by definition redistributive. 
Indeed, the U.S. system, at least if you look at the official rates, has been far more redistributive in the past than it is now, with a top federal income tax rate of 35 percent. 
Just looking at some previous Republican presidents, the top tax rate was over 50 percent under Warren Harding, over 60 percent under Herbert Hoover, over 90 percent for Dwight Eisenhower’s entire term, 70 percent or higher for Nixon’s entire term, and 70 percent under Gerald Ford, said said Daniel N. Shaviro, professor of taxation at New York University Law School. (Shaviro has written in his blog that he supports Obama over Romney.) 
And once this money comes into the federal treasury, it’s quickly redistributed. As we have noted previously, some states send more money to the federal treasury than they get back, while some states receive more money than they put in. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, crunched the numbers back in 2007 and reported that New Mexico got $2.03 for every dollar it sent to Washington, while New Jersey got just 61 cents. 
The approach of redistribution dates back to colonial times, when the colonies levied property taxes on landholders. Since not everyone owned land, but because everyone benefited from at least some of the fruits of that revenue, such taxes were inherently redistributional. Not to suggest that Americans were always happy about this. ""Settlers far from markets complained that taxing land on a per-acre basis was unfair and demanded that property taxation be based on value,"" wrote Glenn W. Fisher, an emeritus public administration professor at Wichita State University. 
Indeed, early efforts to expand infrastructure such as roads and canals -- championed in the 1820s by Sen. Henry Clay --  stumbled over disputes over using general taxpayer money to fund projects with local benefits. Later, subsidies for building transcontinental railroads began in the 1860s but eventually devolved into major corruption scandals. Such funding was, in effect, a redistribution from the public to big business. 
In the second half of the 19th century and the first part of the 20th century, the government added one redistributive program after another -- Civil War benefits and a veterans’ health system took money from the young and gave it to the old; public education and land-grant colleges took money from the old and gave it to the young. Social Security redistributed money from workers to retirees, while agricultural subsidies redistributed funds from non-farmers to farmers. 
""You could argue that a true welfare state didn’t take shape until the New Deal, but even that was 80 years ago, so it doesn’t support the claim that redistribution has ‘never’ been characteristic of America,"" said Rutgers University historian David Greenberg. ""The notion that redistribution is some recent, Obama-led fanaticism, as opposed to a normal, reasonable, widely accepted way of running a large, complex nation, is just silly."" 
Peter Lindert, an economist at the University of California at Davis, says redistribution is an essential function of any government. ""At the most profound level, any choice about how to run a country redistributes well-being from some to others,"" he said. 
Several experts we interviewed cautioned that while Romney’s claim is factually incorrect, it’s important not to overlook his larger point -- that too much redistribution can be a bad thing. 
Douglas J. Besharov, a University of Maryland public policy professor, said that because America has generated so much upward mobility over the years, redistributing too much will ""kill the goose that lays the golden egg."" 
And Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, said that ""we have income-based redistribution in our means-tested programs and, to a lesser extent, age-based redistribution in our social insurance programs, but we're not Europe."" Mitchell added, however, that ""we are heading that direction, which Romney, in his typically inarticulate fashion, was trying to explain."" 
Still, on Romney’s specific claim that ""redistribution"" has ""never been a characteristic of America,"" experts agreed that he ignores longstanding fundamentals of our system of taxing and spending. 
""Not to sound intemperate here, but the claim is completely ridiculous and false,"" said Shaviro, the NYU tax professor. ""This goes way beyond hyperbole. Romney is trying to rewrite and falsify U.S. history."" 
Our ruling 
Romney said that ""redistribution"" has ""never been a characteristic of America."" 
Reasonable people can disagree about the wisdom of it, but redistribution has been a basic principle of the U.S. tax system and many federal programs, including some such as veterans benefits that have long attracted support from Republicans.

Obama says Romney talks tough on China but puts his money there
","
America’s fraught relationship with China seems to creep into every modern presidential election. This time the argument is over which candidate has done more to boost Asia’s largest economy at America’s expense. Mitt Romney slams President Barack Obama for being soft on enforcing trade rules with China. In a television ad, the Obama campaign punches back, saying as an investor, Romney sent American jobs to the very country he promises to boot into line.

The Obama ad gets personal. It says ""Even today part of Romney’s fortune is invested in China."" We wondered if that attack was on the money.

To the extent that some of Romney’s funds can be traced to China, the claim is accurate. In fact, the Romney campaign confirmed it. In an email exchange with us, staff made no bones about it. The candidate has money in Chinese companies.

The campaign noted that Romney has his assets in a blind trust and the trustee is in charge. Staff described Romney’s role in his Chinese investments as passive; he does not decide which funds will get his money and the fund managers pick the places where to invest. The campaign also had something to say about Obama’s investments, which we’ll get to in a bit.

 Romney’s investments

We can trace some examples of how this plays out.

In the personal financial disclosure he filed as a presidential candidate, Romney listed an investment in Bain Capital Asia in the range of $100,000 to $250,000. This is a small amount relative to his estimated net worth of $250 million.

The New York Times reported that Bain Capital Asia purchased a Chinese video surveillance company, Uniview Technologies, in December 2011. The firm supplies cameras and software to police so they can keep watch over public spaces such as universities and commercial centers and share information with their counterparts elsewhere in the country.

Bain Capital Asia has multiple investments and multiple investors, so the Romney stake in Uniview Technologies is highly diluted. But in some small way, his money is there.

When news of the investment broke in March, Romney told reporters he knew nothing about it.

""Any investments that I make are managed by a blind trust,"" he said. ""I don't make investments in Bain or anywhere else. That's done by a trustee who makes decisions that he thinks are correct.""

That trustee, R. Bradford Malt, issued a statement, cited in the New York Times, that he had put the money into the Bain fund before it purchased Uniview. Malt said the Romneys had no say in the matter and that he himself had no control over the fund’s choice of investments.

According to the Boston Globe, Romney reported at least half a million dollars invested in another Bain fund that is a major shareholder in the Chinese retailer Gome.

The blind trust puts Romney at some distance from his Chinese investments. Presumably, if the New York Times hadn’t written about Uniview, he wouldn’t have known where his money was.

Romney’s blind trust

We should note that not all blind trusts are created equal. Romney’s meets the requirements in Massachusetts. His trust would not pass muster in Washington.

""It’s a blind trust only to the extent that Romney calls it that and describes it that way,"" said Meredith McGehee, policy director at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group focused on government ethics.

Romney is much closer to his trustee, Malt, than federal rules would allow. The two men both have close ties to Bain Capital, Romney as founder, and Malt as a lawer to the firm. Romney retains large investments in Bain. None of this matches the criteria of independence and arm’s length dealings that are spelled out in the federal rules.

For one thing, the Office of Government Ethics, the agency that oversees the rules, allows only financial institutions to be trustees; individuals need not apply. Second, the rules would block someone with Malt’s history with Romney and Bain. The regulations state that the office will only accept a trustee who ""is not and has not been employed by any interested party, not served as a director, officer, or employee of any organization affiliated with any interested party."" Romney is the ""interested party,"" and Malt’s work with Bain alone would disqualify him.

Obama’s China connection

The Romney campaign claims that President Obama has money invested in China too, albeit indirectly. The president’s financial disclosure shows he has retirement money in Vanguard mutual funds and the Illinois pension plan.Those funds list investments in some 500 companies, including Apple, Wal Mart, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and General Electric.

Those firms have employees and in some cases, manufacturing facilities in China, which relates to another campaign hot-button issue, outsourcing. However, the companies themselves are based in the U.S. The investments involve domestic, not international, stock purchases.

Our ruling

The Obama campaign ad says, ""Even today part of Romney’s fortune is invested in China.""

The Romney campaign confirms this statement. In particular, news reports show as recently as this year, Romney had money invested in funds that owned shares in two Chinese firms. The amount is not likely to be large, certainly relative to Romney’s sizeable assets, and might be minor in absolute terms as well, due to the dilution that comes with funds with multiple investors and multiple investments.

The claim suggests that Romney had more to do with the investment decision than is the case.

We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097020E40>],/factchecks/2012/sep/20/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-talks-tough-china-puts-his-money/

George Allen says Tim Kaine has ""doubled down"" in his support of defense cuts
","
In recent weeks, Republican U.S. Senate candidate George Allen’s website has opened with a picture of a chained iron gate and the headline: ""Devastating job losses for Virginia.""

""Tim Kaine doubled down in his support of devastating defense cuts, saying the ‘the deal was the right thing to do,’"" the webpage proclaims.

The claim originates from a July 21 debate in Hot Springs between Allen and Kaine, the Democratic senate nominee. Allen criticized last year’s congressional deal to raise the nation’s debt limit, a compromise that could trigger $500 billion in automatic defense cuts to begin in January.

""George, the deal was the right thing to do,"" Kaine said.

Allen, on his website and at numerous appearances, has used that comment to argue Kaine supports those looming defense cuts which, according to projections from George Mason University, could cost Virginia 136,000 jobs.

So we took a look at Allen’s claim that Kaine not only backed the automatic defense cuts, but has ""doubled down"" in his support of them.

The deal

The debt ceiling is the legal limit the federal government can borrow and, since its establishment in 1917, Congress routinely raised it almost 80 times so the United States could continue to meet its obligations. Allen, during his term in the Senate from 2001 to 2007, voted four times to increase the cap.

But the comity ended during the summer of 2011 when the U.S. hit its $14.2 trillion limit and neared an Aug. 2 deadline when it would start defaulting on debts if it couldn’t borrow more.  Republicans insisted on tying a borrowing increase to passage of a debt reduction plan. Negotiations between Congress and the White House stalemated, with the GOP demanding that all of the debt reductions come from spending cuts and Democrats insisting that a portion come from tax increases.

A last-second compromise passed the House by a 269-161 vote on August 1 and, a day later, cleared the Senate on a 74-26 vote. It took a two-step approach to lowering debt.

The first part called for an initial $900 billion in deficit reductions over 10 years through a mix of national security and domestic spending cuts.

The second part created a bipartisan congressional super committee assigned to come up with at least an additional $1.2 trillion in deficit reductions over nine years through spending cuts, tax revenues or both. If the panel deadlocked, $1 trillion in automatic cuts over nine years -- split evenly between defense and domestic programs -- would be triggered at the start of 2013.

While the initial $900 billion in cuts received little attention, the added $1 trillion in automatic cuts, called sequestration, was supposed to be such a dire consequence that it would spur the super committee to craft a bipartisan package of deficit reductions.

Although measure passed with bipartisan support, neither Democrats nor Republican were enamored with it. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, voted for the bill although he said it was ""not perfect."" Still, Cantor said, ""This measure that cuts spending and puts in place long-term fiscal reforms marks the first big change we have accomplished.""

President Barack Obama signed the bill, calling it an ""important first step to ensuring that as a nation we live within our means.""

Kaine’s position

When the initial compromise was struck in Aug. 1, Kaine, called it a ""flawed but necessary agreement.""

""While far from perfect, the current approach before Congress maintains economic stability by raising the debt ceiling and enacts important spending cuts that will help preserve our nation’s and Virginia’s credit rating,"" Kaine said.

Kaine expressed optimistic about the panel. ""I sincerely hope that negotiating without the specter of default or economic collapse will result in less partisan maneuvering and grandstanding and more pragmatic solutions,"" he said.

But last November, the commission announced it failed to come up with a deficit reduction plan, starting the clock ticking towards the automatic cuts that will begin in January unless the White House and Congress intervene.

Kaine said in a November 21 news release that he still hoped that deep defense cuts would be avoided. He suggested Congress turn to bipartisan deficit proposals made by a White House commission in late 2010 and by a group of six senators including, Mark Warner, D-Va.

""There are good models on the table -- Simpson/Bowles proposal and the Gang of Six -- that can be the basis of a meaningful solution that will avoid harmful cuts to defense and health care, cuts that have a particularly negative impact on Virginia,"" Kaine wrote.

Fast forward to the July 21 debate, and Kaine basically said the same thing.

""I believe Congress can still find a deal to avoid the need for cuts that are going to jeopardize our nation’s defense,"" Kaine said. ""Thank goodness Mark Warner and others in the Gang of Six are working to try to find a path forward that will avoid these cuts.""

Kaine, on Sept. 17, endorsed several steps to raise revenues that would replace most of the $1 trillion in sequestration cuts. He called for allowing Bush-era tax cuts to expire for those with incomes of $500,000 or more, repealing the prohibition on Medicare negotiating with prescription drug companies and ending tax breaks to the ""Big Five"" oil companies. Those moves -- all likely to face strong opposition in Congress -- would generate about $750 billion over 10 years, according to federal projections.

Allen’s position

Allen voted four times to raise the debt ceiling when he was in the U.S. Senate from 2001 to 2007. But while the issue was being debated in 2011, he urged Republicans to hold out. ""We conservatives have to say, `If you want us to vote for this, there need to be real cuts...and if we don’t get it, we’re not going to vote for that debt ceiling increase.""

Allen, during the 2011 debt limit debate, signed a ""cut, cap and balance"" pledge that was embraced by many conservative and tea party Republicans. It called for $100 billion in immediate, unspecified budget cuts, a Balanced Budget Amendment, a super majority vote to raise taxes, and phasing in of a cap that in 2017 would limit federal spending to 20 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. Federal spending this fiscal year is projected at $3.8 trillion, or 24.4 percent of the nation’s $15.6 trillion GDP.

Allen has signed a pledge not to support any tax increases. In campaign appearances and policy papers, he has endorsed broad, unspecific policies for reducing spending: a federal government hiring freeze that would not include the military, less regulation and the rooting out of waste.

He is calling for significant reform to entitlement programs, praising Republican proposals to turn Medicare into a program in which seniors would receive government subsidies to purchase private insurance and calling on Washington to cede control of Medicaid to states. He says aggressive development of U.S. fossil fuels will create jobs and ""billions in revenues without raising taxes.""

We should note that Gov. Bob McDonnell -- a Republican and longtime military man -- supported the debt limit deal in 2011 and recently reaffirmed his position in an Aug. 15 speech to the General Assembly’s money committees.

The governor said that the compromise was passed in the shadow of a looming default on U.S. debts. ""For that reason, many reluctantly supported the final agreement that passed, not because of what it contained, but because of what it prevented,"" McDonnell said.

The governor, in the same speech, said that the defense cuts would be ""devastating"" to Virginia.

Our ruling

Allen said that Kaine, in sticking by his endorsement of the the 2011 debt deal, is ""doubling down"" in his support of looming defense cuts.

There’s no doubt Kaine backed the debt-limit agreement at the time and does not second-guess his support. He said, during a debate this summer, ""the deal was the right thing to do."" So Kaine cannot divorce himself from the consequences of the deal.

The consequences -- $1 trillion in cuts to split evenly between defense and domestic programs was set up as a bitter pill so unpalatable to Republicans and Democrats that it would spur a compromise in slicing the deficit. The cuts were set up as a possibility, not a guarantee.

Kaine has consistently said he supported the deal because it was important to raise the debt limit so Washington could continue pay its bills. There’s no record of Kaine calling for the deep defense cuts; to the contrary, he repeatedly said he hoped Congress would strike a compromise to avoid them. That’s the same position that Gov. McDonnell, a Republican, embraced last year and defended this summer.

We doubt that Allen would level the same charge against McDonnell that he has against Kaine. That’s because it is possible to have supported the compromise out of a desire to keep Washington solvent and wish no harm to the nation’s defense.

So we find Allen’s statement has some accuracy but is lacking in context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097036A00>],/factchecks/2012/sep/20/george-allen/george-allen-says-tim-kaine-has-doubled-down-his-s/

Libertarian Gary Johnson says he'll be on presidential ballot in every state, by far outpacing any other third-party nominee
","
Former two-term New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian presidential nominee, says he has a shot at upsetting the major-party nominees in November provided he’s included in the nationally televised presidential debates.

""You know, I don’t want to peak too early,"" Johnson said, seemingly jokingly, in an August 2012 interview for KLRU-TV’s ""Overheard.""

Host Evan Smith asked if some states could prove opportunities for Johnson, who replied: ""I am going to argue that I might be a factor everywhere, not just in certain states,"" though he said he needs to be in the debates to have that chance.

""It’s important to point out that I am going to be on the ballot in all 50 states,"" Johnson said. ""There is no other third-party candidate that’s going to come close to achieving that.""

Are both parts of that so?

The last third-party presidential candidate to make a significant White House run was Texan Ross Perot in 1992, as noted in a Sept. 12, 2012, CNN news article. Perot also was the last third-party hopeful to be invited to the debates.

CNN said Johnson, who initially announced his candidacy as a Republican, has not raised much money, nor does he have a big campaign staff. Still, he told CNN: ""No other third party is going to come close to this 50-ballot access.""

We tried to pin down how many states’ ballots will include Johnson, ultimately realizing that court battles have delayed final decisions in a few states.

Libertarian Party spokeswoman Carla Howell said by phone that Johnson will be on the ballot in 47 states while litigation has tied up his standing in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Depending on legal outcomes, then, he could end up on the ballot in 49 to 50 states, she said.

Johnson campaign spokesman Joe Hunter also put the number at 47 states, with the other states tied up in legal challenges.

For an independent count, we turned to Richard Winger, editor of the California-based Ballot Access News. As of mid-September, he said, Johnson appears likely to be on the ballot in 48 or 49 states, depending on how courts rule, with the Green Party nominee, Jill Stein, on nearly 40 ballots.

Winger said his counts are based on printing off candidate lists from the web pages of state election officials. He said all or parts of five states had yet to finalize November ballots, he said, because of outstanding issues. He specified Connecticut, Michigan, Kansas, Colorado and New York.

Winger pointed us to a Politics1.com chart that he described as generally up to date on the presidential hopefuls set to appear on each ballot. As of Sept. 18, 2012, the chart indicated that Johnson will appear on the ballot in every state except Oklahoma and possibly Pennsylvania and Michigan, which had question marks showing.

The chart indicates Stein will be on the ballot in 38 states including Texas, while she has qualified as a write-in hopeful in five others. Nominees of other third parties are listed as making fewer ballots. Ron Gunzburger, Politics1.com’s publisher and editor, told us by phone that the chart’s notations are based on news accounts, information from state election officials and reports by Ballot Access News.

And why is Johnson appearing on most state ballots?

""The Libertarian Party works hard on ballot access all the time,"" Winger said, and has more members with greater income to pay for such efforts than the Green Party.

Broadly, Winger said, the Libertarian Party was positioned to have its nominee on ballots in 29 states by the start of 2012, thanks to sufficient voter signatures being collected in the states or because past candidates had drawn enough votes to qualify its 2012 nominees for the ballot. By the same time, he said, the Green Party was positioned to be on the ballot in 16 states. ""They just don’t have as much money"" to pay individuals who collect voter signatures, Winger said. ""These things get done by hiring paid circulators. It’s really very sad. What we have in effect is enormous filing fees for third parties.""

Looking back, Winger said, the Libertarian presidential nominee appeared on every state ballot in 1980, 1992 and 1996. Perot made every ballot in 1992 and 1996, and U.S. Rep. John Anderson made every state ballot in 1980. Winger said Lenora Fulani, nominee of the New Alliance Party, made every ballot in 1988.

Our ruling

Johnson said he’s going to be on the ballot in every state and no other third-party nominee will come close. He’s poised to be on the ballot in at least 47 states compared to about 40 states for Stein, the Green Party choice.

"['New Jersey', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Jon Runyan']","
Jon Runyan says if nothing is done to stop $700 billion in cuts from Medicare, some of the program’s accounts will disappear in less than a decade
","
Medicare’s finances face a troubled future and according to U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan, the national health care law is hastening the program’s decline.

Runyan, who is running for another term against Democrat Shelley Adler on Nov. 6, sounded his warning in an interview posted online on Sept. 17 with Townsquare Media New Jersey.

Runyan (R-3rd Dist.) said, ""for those of you that are still in the workforce and have the ability to manage for retirement, we have to have a serious discussion on how to preserve Medicare for the long haul because if we do nothing and continue to let Obamacare siphon off that $700 billion dollars off the top of it, Medicare goes away in less than 10 years -- certain accounts of it -- and it just falls apart at the seams.""

Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- what some call Obamacare -- taking money from Medicare and endangering parts of the program, as Runyan suggests?

There are several problems with that claim.

The law reduces future growth in Medicare costs by $716 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. But that money isn’t cut from Medicare’s current budget and spending will continue to increase.

It’s worth noting that Runyan voted for a Republican budget that also included those spending reductions.

But the larger issue is Runyan’s suggestion that those reductions harm Medicare. The opposite is true.

Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of social medicine and health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, called Runyan’s statement ""absolute nonsense.""

First, Medicare isn’t going away, Oberlander said. ""Second, Obamacare improves Medicare’s benefits and its financial condition.""

Two trust funds pay for Medicare. One of the funds is in good financial shape. When Runyan said certain Medicare accounts would go away, he’s referring to the fund for Medicare Part A, which pays for hospital care.

That fund is in trouble; an April Medicare Trustees report said it will run out of assets and be unable to meet all of its obligations by 2024.

Even then, if nothing is done, the Medicare Trustees project the fund will take in enough revenue to meet 87 percent of its obligations in 2024. But the trustees note that ""in practice, Congress has never allowed a Medicare trust fund to exhaust its assets.""

Runyan’s campaign spokesman, Chris Russell, said that once the fund ""can no longer cover the costs of the benefits it’s supposed to provide, then something needs to give. If it's allowed to get to that point, you will either need to slash benefits or raise taxes to keep it fully intact.  That's [Runyan’s] point.""

Still, the fund will not disappear in less than 10 years. But more importantly, without the Affordable Care Act that fund would be in even worse condition.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated repealing the health care law would boost spending in Medicare Part A by $517 billion, in part by restoring future increases in payments to hospitals.

If the law is repealed, the fund would be unable to meet all of its obligations in 2016, eight years earlier than if the law stays in place. That’s because spending would increase and new revenues dedicated to the fund would be eliminated, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

Our ruling

Runyan said, ""if we do nothing and continue to let Obamacare siphon off that $700 billion dollars off the top of it, Medicare goes away in less than 10 years -- certain accounts of it -- and it just falls apart at the seams.""

This statement is misleading on several fronts.

The health care law decreases growth in future Medicare spending by $716 billion over 10 years. It does not cut that amount from the current Medicare budget.

Analysts project one of the trust funds that pay for Medicare services will be unable to meet all of its obligations in 2024, but the fund would still cover some benefits.

Without the Affordable Care Act, the fund would be exhausted in 2016.

For those reasons, we rate this statement False.

Americans for Tax Reform claims 88,000 Ohioans have lost their jobs since Obama took office
","
Jobs numbers are among the most common statistics used in political claims because they have proven to be a potent issue in campaigns.

Americans for Tax Reform -- the group led by Grover Norquist that is best known for its Taxpayer Protection Pledge opposing all tax increases -- makes a jobs number the most prominent claim in a brochure it mailed to Ohio voters this month.

""Since President Obama took office, over 88,000 Ohio workers have lost their jobs,"" the brochure states in large type. It links the figure to ""wasted spending"" by the federal government and ""not enough jobs.""  
PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out the claim. 
The brochure cites the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment statistics, as the source for its figure. 
PolitiFact Ohio contacted Americans for Tax Reform. Its staff said it specifically used the area unemployment statistics for Ohio from January 2009, the month Obama was inaugurated, and July 2012, the most recent figure that was available on Aug. 29, the day it accessed the data. 
The BLS table shows that there were 5,440,511 employed Ohioans in January 2009, and 5,351,943 employed in July.

Simple subtraction shows 88,568 fewer employed Ohioans, a net loss of jobs that backs up ATR's claim.

But fully understanding the ATR claim requires putting that number in context. As the mailer says, ""it’s important for Ohio to get the whole picture.""

In this case, context is important because the brochure criticizes Obama for what it says is wasteful spending under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, commonly known as the ‘stimulus,’ that didn’t yield jobs that were promised.

It urges voters to call the president and ""tell him to help the economy by cutting government spending and reducing taxes, and urge him to sign the Taxpayer Protection Pledge.""

Some background will help: The Great Recession started in December 2007, before Obama took office, and had its official end in June 2009.

Job losses in Ohio started in February 2008 and continued every month until December 2009, when Ohio employment hit bottom, according to BLS data. Almost twice as many jobs were lost in Ohio in the year before Obama's inauguration -- 173,632 -- as happened on his watch, in the time frame used by ATR's brochure.

Because Obama was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2009, February was actually his first full month in office. That month also was when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- the stimulus specifically cited in the brochure -- was signed into law, on Feb. 17, 2009.

That’s important to know because ATR surrounds the job-loss claim with examples of stimulus projects to bolster the notion of wasteful spending. The timeline ATR used for job losses in Ohio predates the stimulus law by a month.

Using the February figure of 5,414,966 working Ohioans reduces the total job losses through July 2012 to 63,023, more than 28 percent below the claim in ATR's brochure.

Why such a big difference? The months surrounding the transition between President George W. Bush and Obama included some of the most rapid job losses of the recession.

Meanwhile, a seasonal comparison of employment figures, from July 2009 (the first month after the official end of the recession) to July 2012, actually shows Ohio has added more than 42,000 jobs.

It's worth noting that several other figures also appear on the BLS table. They show the number of unemployed Ohioans dropping by 93,472 -- from 511,409 to 417,937 -- between January 2009 and July 2012. Ohio’s labor force also shrank in that period, from 5,951,920 to 5,769,880.

The unemployment rate, which hit its low of 10.6 percent in July 2009, dropped from 8.6 percent in January 2009 to 7.2 percent last July.

So where does that leave the Americans for Tax Reform claim that 88,000 Ohio workers have lost their jobs since Obama took office?

The statement is partially accurate. It correctly cites the number of jobs lost in Ohio between January 2009, the month Obama was sworn in, and July 2012.

But including January in that count also means including a month in which Obama was not president for the first two-thirds of it. And it includes a month and one-half of time that predates enactment of the stimulus law, something the brochure clearly is targeting.

And the statement ignores the trend line of an economy that was hemorrhaging jobs when Obama took office but began heading upward, albeit slowly. Ohio hasn’t recovered all the jobs lost since January 2009. But there are 96,000 more Ohioans working now than in December of that year. And Ohio’s unemployment rate, which through July has fallen for 12 straight months.

Those are important details that provide context needed to fully understand the ATR claim.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0A1440>],/factchecks/2012/sep/20/americans-tax-reform/americans-tax-reform-claims-88000-ohioans-have-los/

Romney ad accuses Obama of refusing 'seven times' to stop 'China's cheating'
","
A campaign ad for Mitt Romney accuses President Barack Obama of failing to confront China to protect American manufacturing jobs.

""Under Obama, we've lost over half a million manufacturing jobs,"" the narrator says. ""And for the first time, China is beating us. Seven times Obama could have stopped China's cheating. Seven times, he refused.""

We’ve looked before at claims about manufacturing job losses and gains under Obama, finding it True that the United States has created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years. (That’s right — the country’s actually gaining now, though not yet by enough to replace the drop in Obama’s early months.) But Democrats have overstepped when they claimed we’ve added "" millions of jobs in manufacturing.""

Still, Romney’s pushed for a harder stance on Chinese trade, while portraying Obama as weak. For this fact-check, we’re examining whether ""seven times Obama could have stopped China’s cheating"" and ""seven times, he refused.""

 What happened ‘seven times’?

The Romney campaign posted a news release Sept. 17, 2012, explaining its reasoning. It says that under Obama, the U.S. Treasury Department has refused seven times to label China as a ""currency manipulator.""

A little background: Twice a year, the Treasury Department must report to Congress on ""the currency practices of America's major trading partners."" If it tells Congress that a country has engaged in manipulating its currency — say, keeping the value of its currency artificially low to boost its exports, as China’s been known to do — that triggers a process to start ""expedited"" negotiations with the country, perhaps drawing in the International Monetary Fund.

The legal designation also prompts Congress to take action to punish the offender.

Slapping China with the label has support from some think tanks, unions, businesses and members of Congress, who urged President George W. Bush and Obama to take the step. Candidate Obama, in fact, pushed for a tougher stance.

The number of times his administration declined to name China a currency manipulator ""is a check on whether Obama administration trade policy has succeeded by the light of his own 2008 promises. It has not,"" said Philip Levy, a Romney supporter who teaches global economics at the Darden School of Business at University of Virginia.

(We rated an Obama promise to urge China to stop manipulation of its currency value a Compromise.)

But a ""currency manipulator"" label isn’t the only way to take China to task for its trade practices. Nor does it automatically stop China’s cheating, as Romney put it.

The last time Treasury cited China as a currency manipulator was in 1994. Negotiations afterward didn’t produce any major results.

Since then, U.S. presidents have argued for a more diplomatic approach. Bush’s Treasury Department, for example, didn’t call China a currency manipulator, but encouraged the country’s membership in the World Trade Organization. It joined in 2001.

As a WTO member, China must play by the rules or face trade cases filed by other member countries. The value of China’s currency, the renminbi, started to rise in 2005 as it worked to bring its policies into line with international trade rules. That rise has stalled in recent years as China grappled with international financial uncertainty.

And that’s renewed calls for the ""currency manipulator"" label.

""The administration continues to let China get away with flouting trade rules just for the sake of diplomacy,"" Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y, said in a statement reported by The Hill in May 2012. ""Calling out China as a manipulator may be awkward, but it is time to take off the kid glove.""

 Different measures

Experts told us that while Romney’s campaign is right that Obama hasn’t labeled China a currency manipulator, that’s not the same thing as failing to pressure China over its trade practices.

""The criterion the Romney campaign is using to judge Obama's China trade policy is ridiculously narrow,"" said Paul Blustein, a trade expert with the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. ""... I'm by no means a big fan of the Obama administration's trade policy toward China, but I think it's absurd to make it sound as if the administration has been somehow ignoring unfair trade practices by the Chinese.""

Obama’s administration has filed trade cases with the WTO over issues such as auto parts and flat-rolled electrical steel, and plans more. It also pursued remedies through the U.S. International Trade Commission and created an Interagency Trade Enforcement Center.

The Bush Administration brought seven WTO cases over two terms. The Obama administration has already filed seven.

(That’s prompted Obama’s campaign staff to say the administration has brought trade cases ""at nearly twice the rate"" as Bush did, something we’ve found just Half True because of the timing of China’s WTO membership.)

Meanwhile, the Obama team has ""urged China"" to let its currency gain value vs. the dollar in periodic talks, said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow for the Peterson Institute for International Economics who writes about U.S.-China trade and worked in the Carter and Ford administrations.

""I would characterize Obama's economic policy towards China as 'case-by-case' litigation and diplomacy,"" he said.  ""By contrast, Romney urges a broader brush, more strategic confrontation.""

 Our ruling

A Romney campaign ad claims that ""seven times Obama could have stopped China's cheating. Seven times, he refused."" It’s true that the Obama administration passed up seven opportunities to label China a currency manipulator, something it’s been encouraged to do by some members of Congress, unions and businesses.

But that designation in 1994 and earlier didn’t stop the kind of ""cheating"" Romney’s talking about. Meanwhile, the ad makes it sound as though Obama ""refused"" to take on China over unfair trade practices. The administration hasn’t done as much as some on the right and left have demanded, but among other things it has filed seven trade cases with the WTO — with more coming — and engaged in diplomatic talks.

Connie Mack says Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit or pay down the debt
","
U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, has made runaway government spending one of his top campaign themes.

Mack, who is challenging Democrat U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, recently took aim against President Barack Obama in an op-ed in The Hill.

""Under President Obama, we’ve had four consecutive years of trillion dollar deficits … ,"" Mack wrote on Sept. 6, the date that Obama spoke at the Democratic National  Convention. ""President Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit, let alone pay down the debt. His idea of a solution is to raise taxes—even though out-of-control spending that is the key driver of debt—and he ironically calls this a ‘balanced approach.’""

Was Mack correct to say that ""Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit, let alone pay down the debt?""

Obama’s plan to reduce the deficit

Obama released his budget proposal in February 2012, which he said achieved $4 trillion deficit reduction. The plan included discretionary spending caps, reductions in the growth of defense spending and reforms to Medicare, Medicaid, and other health programs over 10 years.

The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities,a left-leaning think tank, estimated that the president’s combination of spending cuts and tax increases would lower deficits by $3.8 trillion over a decade. That total included the $1 trillion in reductions that the president and Congress agreed to in 2011.

According to the center, about 46 percent would come from higher revenues; about 54 percent of the reductions would come through spending cuts.

To raise revenues, families making over $250,000 a year would pay more, but Obama also has an extensive list of tax breaks he would eliminate. They can be arcane: For example, Obama would repeal last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories.

On the spending side, the president proposes $580 billion in cuts to a number of programs that range from agricultural subsidies to rental assistance to airport construction.

The Obama campaign claims that over 10 years, it would trim deficits by $4 trillion. Some have questioned that estimate, though, so we rated their $4-trillion claim Half True.  We noted that different think tanks and federal agencies have different methods for estimating deficit reduction and that Obama’s plan counts savings that Congress agreed to last year. (Read our previous fact-check for more details on these differing methodologies.)

The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has said that Obama’s plan is a good start but too modest in its goals.

Obama takes the right approach with ""a gradual and thoughtful deficit reduction plan,"" the committee wrote in recent report. ""However, the proposals in the President’s budget do not go far enough to put the debt on a clear downward path over the next ten years and to control the long-term debt trajectory by reining in the growth of health care and retirement costs.""

Still, while experts might differ on how much Obama’s plan reduces the deficit, it is a plan. That’s counter to Mack’s assertion that Obama doesn’t have one.

 What happens to debt under Obama’s plan

There’s a critical distinction between the deficit and the debt. The deficit is the difference each year between the money the government takes in (taxes, income and fees) and what it spends (defense, Social Security, Medicare and every other government spending program). The debt is all the money the government has borrowed. In other words, it’s the accumulation of those deficits.

So while Obama reduces the deficit, because he’s not eliminating it, he’s not really chipping away at the overall debt.

We contacted several budget experts who work for groups across the political spectrum about Obama’s plans and Mack’s statement that ""President Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit, let alone pay down the debt.""

Some economists told us Obama can make a credible case that he’s reducing debt if he’s reducing its proportion to the size of the overall economy, usually measured as a ratio of debt to the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, which is a measure of the overall economy.

Jim Horney of the left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities used the analogy of a family: The key isn’t the amount of money a family owes on their monthly mortgage, but how much that mortgage is as a proportion of a family’s income. That shows whether the family can afford the monthly bill.

Our fiscal challenges are so great that it’s very unlikely we could balance the budget anytime soon, said Jason Peuquet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal  Budget.  ""The best we can hope for over the next 10 to 20 years is to first stabilize debt as a share of the economy and then put it on a downward path to levels that are safer for the economy,"" he said.

The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s analysis of Obama’s plan states his budget would result in debt levels rising from 73.5 percent of GDP in 2012 up to a peak of 78.6 percent in 2014 and then gradually falling to 75.1 percent by 2022.

Beyond a decade, Obama’s plan would allow debt to rise as a share of the economy as Baby Boomers retire, spiking up expenditures for Social Security and Medicare and due to rising healthcare costs, Peuquet said. And that’s a problem.

Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates reducing the debt, said he would prefer a lower debt-to-GDP ratio than Obama’s plan.

However, ""it is incorrect to say that the Administration does not have a plan to reduce deficits and stabilize the debt. And stabilizing the debt is an appropriate goal for the nation -- since debt is projected to keep growing more quickly than the economy -- which would be detrimental for economic growth.""

Some of our experts were more critical of Obama’s plan.

J.D. Foster of the conservative Heritage Foundation said Obama’s plan was not credible. As an example, Obama’s plan claims reductions associated with winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that’s only a savings if we assume the original policy was to continue the wars indefinitely.  

""In no year does the government run a surplus, and the deficits are rising steadily toward the end of the 10-year horizon, so it is then axiomatic to say the president lacks a plan to reduce the debt.  Reducing the debt requires a budget surplus,"" Foster said.   

Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute, said Obama has ""no plan"" to pay down the debt if we’re referring to total accumulated debt over 10 years. And regarding the deficit, ""the main ‘plan’ that shrinks the projected deficit over the next decade is that federal revenues are expected to rise as the economy is projected to recover in coming years,"" he said.

""Both candidates need to do a much better job of providing details of proposed spending reforms and cuts so that America does not go the way of Greece.""

We sent an email to Mack’s campaign to ask if he had documentation he wanted us to review and did not get a response.

Our ruling 
Mack said that ""President Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit, let alone pay down the debt.""

Obama has presented a plan that reduces the deficit. Analysts have debated whether it goes far enough. But it is a plan.

However, while the plan reduces deficits, it doesn’t eliminate them. And that means the sheer amount of the debt continues to grow. Obama’s defenders would say that his plan stabilizes the debt and makes the debt smaller in comparison with the size of the overall economy. But this is not the same thing as reducing the debt itself.  

So Mack has a point that Obama’s plan doesn’t reduce the debt in dollars. He’s wrong that Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Income', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Mitt Romney']","
Romney ad faults Obama for falling incomes
","
Mitt Romney says President Barack Obama is failing American families with policies that have led to less income and more debt.

Less family income, that is, and more national debt.

""Under Obama, families have lost over $4,000 a year in income, says the narrator of a new campaign ad. ""And the national debt is now $16 trillion and growing.""

The ad then shows clips of Romney promising to reverse those trends.

Here, we’ll check what has happened to household incomes under Obama.

Tracking median incomes

The Romney ad cites an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, which argues that Obama’s presidency has ""done enormous harm to middle-class households.""

The editorial, in turn, points to data from a private group, Sentier Research. Last year, Sentier initiated a new statistic based on U.S. Census Bureau data -- a ""household income index"" that tracks upticks and downticks in median income and reports it monthly.

What did Sentier find? In January 2009, the month Obama took office, median household income was $54,893. In June 2012, it was $50,881, a drop of almost $4,000. (We used inflation-adjusted figures from a spreadsheet provided to us by Sentier. The Wall Street Journal cited slightly different figures, but the difference is just a few dollars.)

To create Sentier’s index, principals Gordon Green and John Coder take data from the 
Bureau’s monthly household survey, the one used to determine the national unemployment rate. This census survey reaches approximately 50,000 households and 130,000 household members each month, asking a variety of questions, including the sum of income earned by household members during the previous 12 months.

That’s very similar to how the census produces its report called the Current Population Survey -- Annual Social and Economic Supplements. That survey also asks households about income, but over a given calendar year. The census’ Current Population Survey was just released for 2011. The median income: $50,054.

Green told us the comparable figure in his work is Sentier’s January 2012 index because it asked respondents about their income for the previous 12 months. In that case, those months are calendar year 2011. Sentier’s median income for that period: $50,020, a difference of just $34. That would indicate that Sentier's methodology produces a number very close to the official census number.

Sentier’s index is a new measuring stick, and not time-tested, but Green and Coder are both retired from the census, and their work has been widely cited in the media.

""The Census Bureau is the source of official statistics,"" Green said. ""What we do is fill it in with the monthly data.""

Other factors

This brings us to the dicey issue of blaming Obama for the trend, whatever it is. At PolitiFact, we don’t only assess the accuracy of statistics cited in political claims, but whether it’s valid to say a certain politician is responsible.

We asked Dean Baker, co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, for his take.

""There is always a problem in attributing outcomes to presidents based on their terms, since there are a large number of erratic factors over which they have no control. This is especially the case with President Obama, who inherited an economy that was falling off a cliff,"" Baker said.

He added that a better question is what Romney or anyone else would have done that would have produced better results.

""Romney seems to be saying that a big tax cut would have done the trick with little or no money to help the states or for any of the other spending components of the stimulus. That doesn't seem very plausible to me, but that is the question that we should be asking,"" Baker said.

Plus, a look back at incomes over several years shows that incomes track the state of the overall economy. According to the census, the median income hit an all-time high in 1999 (when you adjust for inflation), reaching $54,932. It decreased each year through 2004, hitting $52,788. It then climbed again until 2007 -- the beginning of the recession -- to $54,489, and has been on the way down since then. Sentier’s research also reflects steady increases with small dips and peaks over the past decade.

Dan Mitchell, a scholar with the libertarian Cato Institute, had this to say about the blame factor:

""That drop started before Obama took office, so I don't think he deserves full blame for everything after Jan. 20, 2009,"" Mitchell said. ""But this has been a very weak recovery, so clearly he should be held responsible for some of the bad news.""

Our ruling

Romney’s ad says that ""under Obama families have lost over $4,000 a year in income.""

That figure comes from a new but well-respected index created by Sentier Research, which tracked a decline in the median family income from the month Obama took office through June 2012. It’s tricky to compare that data with census data because they represent different time periods. But where it is possible to compare Sentier with the census, the results are within a few dollars of each other.

But the ad’s claim runs into trouble by overtly blaming Obama. The economy was on a downward track before he took office, and a president has limited control over those forces. To the extent he should be held responsible, Mitchell told us, the slow recovery has all been on his watch.

Romney’s ad cites trustworthy figures but oversimplifies the issue by assigning blame to Obama. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097568780>],/factchecks/2012/sep/19/mitt-romney/romney-ad-faults-obama-falling-incomes/

Obama ties Romney and Ryan to abortion ban with no rape, incest exceptions
","
CORRECTION: We have corrected this item to note that Mitt Romney has said he would allow abortion when the life of the mother is in jeopardy. We had mistakenly said ""health"" of the mother in our original version. 
With women voters as a key swing group in this election, Barack Obama continues to attack Mitt Romney on abortion. The Obama campaign made abortion rights a central point at the Democratic convention and now has launched yet another television ad that casts Romney as favoring the most hardline position on abortion rights.

The ad is called ""Dangerous"" and it says Romney and running mate Paul Ryan ""both backed proposals that would outlaw abortions even in cases of rape or incest.""

This is different from previous claims from the Obama campaign. During the summer, the campaign attacked Romney for backing a strict anti-abortion bill with no exception for rape and incest. In fact, that claim was based on a moment in a 2007 debate when there was no mention of exceptions one way or the other and there was no actual bill. The claim was factually inaccurate and distorted Romney's explicit support for precisely those exceptions. The combination of inaccuracy and misdirection earned the Obama campaign a Pants on Fire rating. This time, the Obama team speaks of something broader -- a ‘proposal’ -- and it includes Ryan's position.

Recently, the Obama camp tweeted that Ryan would ban all abortions even in cases of rape and incest. The use of the word ‘all’ earned that claim a rating of Half True.

That's because Ryan favors an exception where an abortion is needed to save the life of the mother. However, as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported, he opposes exceptions for rape and incest. The National Right to Life Committee concurs, based on information the group collected in 1998 and 2000 from Ryan as a candidate. The anti-abortion group gives Ryan a 100 percent rating. Ryan now says he will follow Romney’s policy.

But the current Obama ad does away with the ""all"" and so its claim for Ryan stands on solid ground.

On Romney, the record is murky.

To be sure, he has flip-flopped on the issue, earning a Full Flop on PolitiFact's Flip-O-Meter. His current stance, as he prominently posted in the pages of the National Review in 2011, is to outlaw abortion except to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape and incest. He would press to see Roe vs. Wade overturned and allow states to set their own rules on abortion.

The charge that he went beyond that view rests on an interview he had with former Arkansas governor, Mike Huckabee, on Fox television. Huckabee asked Romney about a Massachusetts law that helped cover the costs of abortion. Romney said it would take a state constitutional amendment to change that and then Huckabee asked, ""Would you have supported a constitutional amendment that would have established the definition of life as conception?""

Romney replied, ""Absolutely.""

To Democrats, this was the same as if Romney had said he supported a personhood amendment. A personhood measure was on the ballot in Mississippi and had it passed, the impacts would have been profound.

""It would definitely ban abortion,"" said Glenn Cohen, an assistant professor at Harvard Law. Cohen is co-director of the law school’s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law, Biotechnology and Bioethics and assessed the Mississippi measure.

But it is unclear if Romney was endorsing a personhood amendment because Huckabee never used the word ‘personhood’. Nor did Huckabee mention Mississippi.

""Life beginning at conception is a general statement,"" said Anne Fox, president of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, a group opposed to abortion. ""A personhood amendment is a specific piece of legislation.""

When we contacted the Obama campaign, a spokeswoman cited this interview as evidence that Romney had endorsed a personhood amendment in Massachusetts. But there is little proof that such an amendment ever existed.

Neither Fox nor Cohen, two people who closely follow the legal framework for abortion in Massachusetts, have ever seen the text of a personhood amendment in their state. While there is a website to recruit activists to put such a measure on the ballot in Massachusetts, it is registered to a Keith Mason in Colorado. The home page says ""The organizers that got personhood on the ballot in Colorado, would like to help in Massachusetts as well."" Keith Mason is the president of Personhood USA, an amendment advocacy group.

Further, Cohen argues that the legal gap between ‘life begins at conception’ and personhood is large.

""Saying ""life"" begins at fertilization is quite different from saying ""personhood"" does. No one denies that fetuses or embryos are alive, but many dispute that they are persons in the sense that they have legal rights -- at least not to be destroyed without very good reason."" Cohen said.

Would these legal distinctions matter to every anti-abortion activist? Not necessarily. Throughout the history of this debate, the phrase ""life begins at conception"" has often been synonymous with banning abortions. Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan, makes that connection and, as we noted, would make no exception for rape and incest. These lexical associations further muddy the meaning of Romney’s answer to Huckabee.

Romney has kept specific personhood measures at arm’s length. He never endorsed the Mississippi ballot measure. Claiming a scheduling conflict, he did not participate in personhood candidate forums in Iowa, South Carolina and Florida sponsored by Personhood USA.

Romney’s relations with Personhood USA have been rocky. The group accused him of ""throwing a pro-life congressman under the bus"" when Missouri Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin made controversial comments about rape victims and Romney said Akin should withdraw from the race. Romney refused to sign the Personhood USA pledge that mirrors the Mississippi measure. On some occasions, however, the group has spoken well of Romney.

Our ruling

Barack Obama said in a television ad that Romney and Ryan Romney ""both backed proposals that would outlaw abortions even in cases of rape or incest.""

That is true for Ryan. His opposition to abortion, including in cases of rape and incest, is clear. Romney chose Ryan as his running mate and now Ryan says he’ll follow Romney’s lead.

Romney has said he supports an amendment that defines life as beginning at conception. When he said that, there was no specific amendment language for him to consider. The term ""life begins at conception"" is strongly associated with banning abortion, and in some advocates’ view, without exception for rape and incest.

But Romney has distanced himself from formal personhood amendments and he made clear in National Review that he supports exceptions for rape or incest. Still, his words and his choice of Ryan tend to blur the distinctions that he himself would emphasize.

In-person voter fraud ‘a very rare phenomenon’
","
With less than two months to November’s presidential election, voter laws have taken center stage. The latest area of contention is Pennsylvania, where the outcome of the state’s new voter identification law is before that state’s Supreme Court.

Pennsylvania’s law, signed into law by Gov. Tom Corbett in March, follows similar laws in states such as Georgia, and it is scheduled to take effect in time for the November general election. Pennsylvania’s law would require voters to show an official ID -- including a state driver’s license, government employee ID or a state nondriver ID card -- to cast a ballot. Thirty-one states have laws in place that will require all voters to show ID at the polls this November, according to the National Conference of State Legislators.

As in other states, supporters say the law is necessary to combat voter fraud; opponents say the new law disenfranchises poor, minority and elderly voters who are less likely to have the approved IDs. Opponents also say the voter ID laws are unnecessary because the voter fraud used to justify the laws doesn’t exist. Politifact has done extensive research on the issue of voter ID laws and the impact on voters and Election Day turnout.

The NAACP, working with a variety of civil rights groups opposing the state’s law, held a news conference in Philadelphia last week warning about the possible negative impact the voter ID law could have on Pennsylvania’s eligible voters.

In an announcement about the news conference, the NAACP said that ""Since 2000, only 10 cases of in-person voter fraud have been proven nationally.""

That number the organization used is very specific for a 12-year period. The NAACP figure deals only with ""in-person voter fraud."" And only with cases that have been ""proven."" This type of voter fraud, experts say, is extremely rare.

PolitiFact Georgia wondered how the civil rights organization had arrived at its conclusion. What was the criteria examined for the voter fraud cases? How was the fraud proved or disproved? And is the number correct?

We asked the NAACP about the basis for its claim and found that the group used statistics from a nationwide analysis of 2,068 cases alleging election fraud that were reviewed by News21, a Carnegie-Knight investigative reporting project staffed by college journalism students.

Results of News21’s seven-month analysis were released in August. The claim made involves a narrow type of election fraud, in-person voter fraud, that voter ID laws are intended to prevent. The News21 team defined that type of fraud as that involving individuals who vote in person on Election Day by impersonating another registered voter.

To get the data, News21 reporters sent records requests to elections officers in all 50 states seeking every case of fraudulent elections activity, including registration fraud, absentee ballot fraud, voter impersonation fraud and casting an ineligible vote. News21 said it received no useful responses from several states. With some states, including Massachusetts, Oklahoma, South Carolina and South Dakota, the cases included in the database came from a survey of alleged election fraud conducted by the Republican National Lawyers Association. And in some states, some but not all local jurisdictions responded, and some responses were missing important details about each case. Despite those issues, News21 defends its work as ""substantially complete"" as the largest collection of election fraud cases gathered by anyone in the country.

After compiling all the information into an election fraud database, News21 found that 207 cases of other types of election fraud existed for every case of voter impersonation.

""It’s difficult to study the issue of impersonation fraud, which I understood [from the News21 case analysis] to be really just allegations,"" said Michael McDonald, an associate professor in the department of public and international affairs at George Mason University whose electoral system research was compiled as The United States Elections Project. ""Still, yes, it’s plausible and occasionally people have done it. ... But by all accounts it’s a very rare phenomenon.""

In Georgia, for example, News21’s database includes 301 cases of reported election fraud and no cases of voter impersonation. Twenty-three total election fraud cases were listed for Pennsylvania; none were for voter impersonation.

The data compiled by the News21 project have been used widely by various civil rights groups and cited in several news articles as the issue of election requirements -- specifically voter ID laws -- has intensified. For the most part, the News21 analysis has been unchallenged, with the exception of the Republican National Lawyers Association, which has supported voter ID laws.

News21 began gathering data in January by reviewing about 375 cases of alleged voter fraud collected by the RNLA. The News21 analysis found that the RNLA cases consisted mainly of newspaper articles about various election issues with little supporting evidence of actual in-person voter fraud.

In an email response to PolitiFact Georgia, Michael Thielen, the RNLA’s executive director, classified News21’s analysis involving the in-person voter fraud cases as ""highly flawed in its very approach to the issue."" And, by stating that voter impersonation is the only type of election fraud that voter ID laws could prevent, the News21 report was result-driven, attempting to prove that voter ID is not necessary, Thielen said.

Thielen and the RNLA maintain that voter ID laws would prevent several types of election fraud, including voting in multiple states, noncitizen voting and voting in multiple jurisdictions within a state. He referenced the RNLA’s December 2011 Vote Fraud State Survey, a compilation of limited searches for election law crimes within the 50 states in recent years. The RNLA is working on a detailed response to News21’s report, Thielen said.

The NAACP’s claim -- actually, News21’s -- that only 10 provable cases of voter impersonation have occurred in the country in the past dozen years is based on extensive analysis and data received from the actual elections officials in charge of handling these issues. Without doing a repeat of the 50-state data collection and review, it is impossible to re-create the same type of research.

Supporters of the voter ID laws, including the RNLA, still defend them. But the RNLA’s own research alleging that more cases of fraud exist than the News21 claim includes several other types of election fraud, not just voter impersonation.

The NAACP’s claim, and in turn News21’s, appears mostly accurate, with an extensive database supporting it. There are a few missing pieces, however, in the data.

We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809759A540>],/factchecks/2012/sep/19/naacp/-person-voter-fraud-very-rare-phenomenon/
"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Ryan says four times as many people quit job hunting as found work
","
The latest Labor Department jobs report, issued Sept. 7, 2012, was another disappointment: Only 96,000 jobs added nationwide.

That was below the projections from various economists that 125,000 jobs would be added.

The report, which was issued one day after the Democratic National Convention, became The Story for the presidential campaign -- at least for that day.

In an interview with CNBC, Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman, blamed President Barack Obama for the state of employment.

""This is not even close to what a recovery looks like,"" Ryan said.

Ryan noted that there must be 150,000 jobs created just  to keep in pace with population growth, and blamed ""bad fiscal policy"" from the Obama administration for the disappointing results.

Then he offered this observation: ""For every person who got a job, nearly four people stopped looking for a job.""

Now that makes it all sound even more discouraging.

Is Ryan right?

The Labor Department report report said that 12.5 million people were out of work in August, a number that was little changed from the previous month.

But the figure Ryan seized upon is less-noticed.

It’s the labor force participation rate and its monthly fluctuations are seen by some as a barometer about how the unemployed are viewing their job prospects. If they’re discouraged enough, they drop out of the labor force and report that they are not only unemployed but not actively seeking work.

That, in turn, affects the unemployment rate, which in August dropped from 8.3 to 8.1 percent.

In other words, the way the unemployment rate is tallied, it could fall even if no one found a new job, and instead more people stopped looking. It also does not count people who, for instance, go back to college for more training to get a better job.

In August, the labor force participation declined by 0.2 percent, or about 370,000 people, the Labor Department reported. And that’s the number at the center of Ryan’s claim. His statement notes that the increase in the number of people who have a job (96,000) is about a fourth of the number of people who dropped out of the labor force.

Ryan repeated the statement Sept, 9, 2012 on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"".

It’s an unconventional way to parse the monthly report, but other Republican leaders and conservative pundits have used a similar approach.

""This has been a pattern throughout the recession,"" James Sherk of the Heritage Foundation wrote on The Hill.com blog on Sept 10, 2012. ""Labor force participation rates have fallen 2.5 percentage points, to 63.5 percent, since December 2007. That is the lowest rate since 1981-- a time when far fewer women worked. ""

Sherk concluded that the adult male work force has hit an all-time low of 72.7 percent, a fifth of which is due to factors such as the retirement of Baby Boomers.

""The poor economy has caused the rest,"" he said.

Others economists have said retirements have played a larger role -- that people are retiring rather than simply giving up on a job hunt.

The Huffington Post quoted a Barclays Capital economist Michael Gapen as saying the bank didn’t expect the participation rate to rebound ""any time soon and its decline is mainly driven by the ageing (sic) of the population and the exit of the baby boomers from the labor market.""

""Therefore, the decline in the unemployment rate is not reflective of underlying strength in employment in this report, "" Gapen said.

In March 2011, the Congressional Budget Office said the retirement of Baby Boomers ""will cause the potential labor force participation rate to decline throughout the next decade.""

While Ryan’s numbers check out, we feel it’s important to note -- even if Ryan didn’t -- that both the jobs numbers and the unemployment numbers are only estimates. Indeed, on the jobs side, we have previously noted the monthly numbers can change dramatically by the time the next quarterly census -- a more complete look at all jobs -- is completed.

Our rating

Ryan said four times as many people gave up working in August 2012 than found a job. He’s highlighting a couple of figures from the Labor Department’s monthly report, and notes that one figure is four times as high as the other. What he doesn’t say, of course, is that both figures are estimates and subject to revision. And he doesn’t account for another key factor: Baby Boomers are retiring.

"['Ohio', 'Debt', 'Federal Budget', 'Stimulus', 'John Boehner']","
John Boehner says Obama engaged in a spending binge that rang up a $16-trillion debt
","
When the Treasury Department announced on Sept. 4 that the national debt had topped $16 trillion, the Associated Press reported, Barack Obama's GOP rivals ""used the grim-but-expected news to criticize the president for the government's fiscal performance over his 3 1/2 years in office.""

Among the leaders who issued news releases was House Speaker John Boehner.
Instead of working to cut the deficit, the Ohio Republican said, ""the president went on a stimulus-fueled spending binge that stuck every American man, woman, and child with a $50,000 share of this $16 trillion national debt.""

PolitiFact Ohio was interested. Does spending under Obama break down to a $50,000-per-person share of the national debt? 

We asked Boehner's office for more information.

They responded that the speaker ""has often talked about President Obama’s stimulus-fueled spending binge"" and called it ""a reference to his entire approach to economic policy, not just one bill ...

""It's the strategy Obama has pursued since taking office: spend more, refuse to make cuts and reforms where needed because, he argues, such cuts and reforms would hurt the economy.  Under his presidency,"" Boehner’s staff said, ""our national debt has increased by $5 trillion and has brought the total share in debt for every American to $50,000.  We would not have reached that level of debt on September 4th without the contribution of his economic policies.""

The cost per person is accurate, and even a little understated. With population estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau at roughly 314.4 million, the average share works out to about $50,900.

The national debt has risen more than $5.4 trillion from its level of $10.6 trillion when Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009.

But can that all be tied to Obama's spending? It’s a question we’ve addressed before.

In May, PolitiFact looked at historical data from the Office of Management and Budget along with projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and calculated the average spending increases per year for 10 presidents over the past 60 years (skipping President Gerald Ford, whose tenure was too short to adequately measure).

Using raw dollars (not adjusted for inflation), Obama oversaw the lowest annual increases of spending among them. Jimmy Carter had the highest, followed by Richard Nixon.

PolitiFact also did a recalculation because of the special case of 2009, which came amid an economic and financial free fall that drove the nation’s leaders to spend a lot more than they ordinarily would. The 2009 fiscal year began four months before Obama moved into the White House, and its major spending decisions were made by George W. Bush and the previous Congress.

The recalculation shifted spending from Bush to Obama for the economic stimulus package, an expansion of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, an incremental increase in appropriations over Bush's level and the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

That shift moved Obama from last place in spending increases to either second from the bottom or third from the bottom.

Using inflation-adjusted dollars, Obama had the second-lowest increase in average annual spending. In fact, he actually presided over a decrease once inflation is taken into account. (Lyndon Johnson was highest on that chart; Dwight Eisenhower was lowest.)

So why the disconnect between Obama’s image as a big spender and the reality of how much federal spending has actually grown?

First, Obama’s record on debt is a lot less flattering than is his record on federal government spending. During the time that spending is poised to be increasing by 1.4 percent per year under Obama, the debt will be increasing by 14.6 percent per year.

The reason? Year by year, federal revenues haven’t been keeping up with spending, due to the struggling national economy (which has held back tax revenues) and a continuation of tax cuts.
And each year there’s an annual deficit, the national debt grows.

Second, federal spending under Obama is higher as a share of gross domestic product than it has been in most of the previous 60 years. That, too is because of the economy, which has simultaneously slowed the growth of GDP and boosted government spending for programs such as food stamps and Medicaid.

Third, the aging of the baby boomers has driven a rise in entitlement spending that is masking cuts Obama and the GOP Congress have made, and have promised to make, in discretionary spending.

Finally, many Americans associate Obama with the high-profile legislative activities of his first year or two, when initiatives such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- commonly called the stimulus -- sent spending upward the fastest. Since then, spending has slowed, thanks in part to spending cuts pushed by congressional Republicans.

FactCheck.org found the spending Obama inherited ""was so high that even modest increases keep it at a level that is extraordinarily lofty by historical standards."" As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, the nation's economic production, spending is running at the highest level since the 1940s.

But tax revenues are also low by historical standards, FactCheck.org found, and are at their lowest level as a percentage of GDP since 1950.

Boehner’s claim included an accurate estimate of what the national debt of $16 trillion would cost per person.

But his claim stated that as a result of a presidential ""stimulus-fueled spending binge"" every American man, woman, and child"" was stuck with a $50,000 share of the $16 trillion debt. That’s an overreach.

The debt grew to $16 trillion not just because of Obama's actions, but also due to actions taken by present and past presidents and Congresses.

The stimulus package came with a $787 billion price tag. If you include all growth in the national debt under the Obama administration, it’s roughly $5.4 trillion, not $16 trillion. The administration inherited a national debt of more than $10 trillion when it came into office.

But Boehner’s claim saddles the administration with responsibility for all of the $16 trillion.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Boehner’s claim rates False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4B1F40>],/factchecks/2012/sep/19/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-obama-engaged-spending-binge-ran/

Mitt Romney says voters who support Barack Obama are “people who pay no income tax”
","
A surreptitiously recorded video of Mitt Romney speaking at a fundraiser stirred up the presidential race on Sept. 17, 2012. The video showed Romney saying that 47 percent of the American public are ""dependent on government,"" ""believe that they are victims"" and ""believe the government has a responsibility to care for them.""

Romney also claimed that the 47 percent of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes are strong Obama supporters because they are so dependent on government benefits that Obama freely provides.

""There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,"" Romney said, according to the video leaked to the liberal magazine Mother Jones. ""All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what.

""And I mean the president starts out with 48, 49 percent … he starts off with a huge number,"" Romney continued. ""These are people who pay no income tax. Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn’t connect. So he’ll be out there talking about tax cuts for the rich. I mean, that’s what they sell every four years. And so my job is is not to worry about those people. I’ll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives. What I have to do is convince the five to 10 percent in the center that are independents, that are thoughtful....""

Almost immediately after the video hit the news, we received a flood of requests from readers asking us to check Romney’s claims.

In this item, we’ll look at whether the ""48, 49 percent"" that supports President Barack Obama are ""people who pay no income tax.""

We should note that Romney, during a hastily called news conference in California, called his comments ""not elegantly stated,"" but he didn’t backtrack from their substance. What he said is ""a message which I'm going to carry and continue to carry, which is, look, the president's approach is attractive to people who are not paying taxes, because, frankly, my discussion about lowering taxes isn't as attractive to them. And therefore, I'm not likely to draw them into my campaign....""

In this item, we'll look at who pays taxes -- and who doesn't. Then we'll look at whether Obama supporters and Americans who don’t pay taxes are one and the same.

Who pays taxes

Romney’s figure is close to one from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, which found that 46 percent of tax filers pay no income tax, vs. about 54 percent of tax filers that did have some federal income tax liability. Generally speaking, the groups most likely to have no tax liability are the elderly and the poor.

Anti-tax Republicans tend to focus on the federal income tax burden because it helps make their case that the federal income tax burden falls disproportionately on the wealthy. Because there is a solid basis for this number, we’ve rated it True in the past -- at least when it is described correctly.

That qualifier is important. While the 46 percent figure refers to federal income tax, federal income tax is not the only tax that Americans pay. It’s not even the only federal tax people pay. An additional 28 percent will at least pay federal payroll taxes, which funds Social Security and Medicare and is deducted from every working American’s paycheck. Most of the rest are the poor and elderly.

So, Romney would have been right if he said about 47 percent of all Americans don't pay federal income taxes. But he went further, arguing that those 47 percent of Americans who don’t pay federal income taxes are essentially all Obama supporters. And the facts don't back him up.

Obama supporters

It's tricky to compare taxpaying status with presidential preferences, but there are enough data points that we can poke some significant holes in Romney’s argument.

• Income levels. We compared Tax Policy Center data with a recent CBS News-New York Times poll.

Among households with below $50,000 in income, 68 percent owed no federal income taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center. The poll showed Obama led in this group, 58 percent to 37 percent.

For households between $50,000 and $100,000, 11 percent owed no federal income taxes. Romney led in this group, 50 percent to 47 percent.

And for households above $100,000, 2 percent owed no federal income taxes. Romney led in this category, 57 percent to 41 percent.

So there’s a modest correlation between the likelihood of not paying income taxes and the likelihood of supporting Obama. But Romney vastly overstates the link. Obama has substantial support among households $100,000 and up, and virtually all of them pay income taxes.

Put another way, Obama is expected to win millions of votes from people who do pay federal income taxes, and Romney is expected to win millions of votes from people who do not pay federal income taxes.

• Senior citizens. Romney gets strong support from seniors. He led in the CBS-New York Times poll by a 53 percent to 38 percent margin, and a CNN and Opinion Research Corp. poll from around the same time had Romney leading among senior by a 53 percent to 45 percent margin.

Yet being a senior is one of the biggest reasons an American would pay no federal income taxes. Among those who saw tax breaks wipe out their income-tax liability, nearly half benefited from a tax break targeted at senior citizens.

• State by state data. The Tax Foundation has found some state-by-state patterns that are problematic for Romney’s claim.

The foundation tallied the states that had the highest percentages of non-income-tax-paying residents. The 10 states with the highest rates of non-tax-payers are mostly ones that Romney has in the bag -- Texas, Idaho, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. And several states with the lowest rates are solidly in Obama’s camp, including Minnesota, Maryland and Massachusetts.

Our ruling

Romney said that the ""48, 49 percent"" that supports President Barack Obama are ""people who pay no income tax.""

But the polls and income tax data don't back this up. Obama gets substantial support from people earning more than $50,000 -- and 90 percent of them, or more, do pay taxes. And Romney gets lots of support from seniors, many of whom have no income tax liability. We rate the claim False.

Mitt Romney says 47 percent of Americans pay no income tax
","
Mitt Romney told wealthy donors gathered at a high-dollar campaign fundraiser that there’s a group of voters he believes he can never win over: people who pay no taxes.

Video of Romney speaking at the event, held in Boca Raton, Fla., was leaked to the liberal magazine Mother Jones on Sept. 17, 2012, stirring up controversy in the heated presidential race.

In his remarks, Romney used broad strokes to characterize millions of people who he said solidly support President Barack Obama.

""There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,"" Romney said in the video. ""All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what.
   
""And I mean the president starts out with 48, 49 percent … he starts off with a huge number,"" Romney continued. ""These are people who pay no income tax. Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn’t connect. So he’ll be out there talking about tax cuts for the rich. I mean, that’s what they sell every four years. And so my job is is not to worry about those people. I’ll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.""

We’re checking several claims from his remarks at the May 2012 event. Taxes are a contentious issue in the presidential campaign, and the statistic Romney mentioned was sure to pique the attention of the ostensible 1-percenters in his audience.

As for his claim that 47 percent of Americans pay no income tax at all: Guess what? He’s right.

Who pays

It's clear Romney is referring to federal taxes and his figure mirrors one from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, which found that in 2011, 46 percent of tax filers paid no income tax, vs. about 54 percent of tax filers that did have some federal income tax liability. In 2009, the Tax Policy Center estimated the proportion who paid no taxes was 47 percent.

About half of people who don’t pay income taxes are simply poor, and the tax code explicitly exempts them.

""For example, a couple with two children earning less than $26,400 will pay no federal income tax this year because their $11,600 standard deduction and four exemptions of $3,700 each reduce their taxable income to zero,"" Roberton Williams, a scholar with the Tax Policy Center, wrote last year. ""The basic structure of the income tax simply exempts subsistence levels of income from tax.""
   
The remaining Americans who owe no federal income taxes are benefiting from tax breaks, the center found.

""Three-fourths of those households pay no income tax because of provisions that benefit senior citizens and low-income working families with children. Those provisions include the exclusion of some Social Security benefits from taxable income, the tax credit and extra standard deduction for the elderly, and the child, earned income, and child care tax credits that primarily help low-income workers with children,"" he wrote.

PolitiFact Oregon examined a claim similar to this one last year, citing research by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a bipartisan committee of Congress. The committee found that for 2009, roughly 22 percent of ""tax units"" ended up without any tax liability. Another 30 percent got all their tax money back from the government, through mechanisms such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, which encourages low-income Americans to work by refunding money to them through the tax code. By contrast, the committee found just 49 percent of Americans owed anything to the government.
   
Put another way, 51 percent of taxpayers in 2009 had zero liability, according to the committee’s research.

Our ruling

Romney said at the fundraising event that ""47 percent of Americans pay no income tax.""

He didn’t specify federal income tax, and many states do levy their own income taxes. But since Romney was referring to a sector of the entire American population, we think it’s clear he was talking about federal taxes.

Research by the Tax Policy Center supports his claim. The think tank found that many Americans are so poor that they owe no taxes, and others qualify for enough breaks and exemptions to reduce their liability to nothing. Another report by the Joint Committee on Taxation from 2009 found an even larger share of Americans who owed nothing.

Update: Brendan Doherty says Cicilline campaign worker never paid back $103,000 loan to city
","
EDITOR's NOTE: On Sept. 16, 2012, PolitiFact Rhode Island rated as Mostly False a statement by Republican congressional candidate Brendan Doherty that was directed at U.S. Rep. David Cicilline. Doherty said: ""The Providence Economic Development Partnership . . which you [Cicilline] chaired, loaned $103,000 in taxpayer funds to one of your campaign workers. The worker never paid back the loan."" In light of additional evidence, we are changing our rating to Mostly True and providing this new analysis.

Republican congressional candidate Brendan Doherty leveled a host of charges against his Democratic opponent U.S. Rep. David Cicilline one day after Cicilline’s primary win.
   
Among what Doherty called Cicilline’s ""most serious deceptions"" was this claim directed at the former mayor: ""The Providence Economic Development Partnership ... which you chaired, loaned $103,000 in taxpayer funds to one of your campaign workers. The worker never paid back the loan.""
   
The borrower in question was Erasmo Ramirez, who worked on Cicilline’s 2002 campaign. He was thrust  into the public spotlight last month when he surfaced in an undercover video talking to an aide to Anthony Gemma, Cicilline’s primary opponent. Ramirez is heard saying he manipulated absentee ballots when he worked for Cicilline’s campaign and he could do the same for Gemma if he was put on the Gemma payroll.
   
After the release of the taped solicitation, The Providence Journal published a story showing that the city’s Economic Development Partnership program had given Ramirez a $103,000 loan in 2004 to help start a restaurant on Union Avenue.
   
Cicilline spokesman Eric Hyers told The Journal at the time that the loan ""has been repaid in full.""
   
But  Doherty’s campaign cited an Aug. 30 story by GoLocalProv which reported Ramirez never paid back the loan.
   
One campaign had the story wrong, so we decided to check the records ourselves.

Minutes of the partnership’s meetings show the development agency first approved loaning Ramirez $103,000 on Feb. 17, 2004. The loan was just one of several Ramirez had taken out for his proposed El Portal Family Restaurant, at 207 Union Ave. -- a project estimated to cost $706,000.

To secure the loan, Ramirez offered up as his main collateral two other pieces of property he owned, but the project met immediate obstacles. On four separate occasions, between January 2005 and June 2006, Ramirez sought and received from the development agency permission to delay making loan payments. (He also requested a second, $65,000 loan, but was denied.)
   
Ultimately the restaurant never opened. The city moved to foreclose on the restaurant property when Ramirez failed to pay his taxes. And on Sept. 8, 2006, real estate records show, the city sold the property at public auction. Westcott Development Inc. bought it for the amount owed in outstanding taxes: $10,485.22.
   
But what about Ramirez’s defaulted $103,000 loan?

In our initial story, we said that Ramirez sold one of his collateral properties to cover the loan, a house at 529 Union Ave. But further investigation shows that the travel of that transaction was anything but that simple.

Paperwork describing in detail what happened with that property was missing from the public files we examined at the Providence Economic Development Partnership. The agency’s new lawyer, John Garrahy, told us Tuesday that a previous city attorney considered the documents private under attorney/client privilege and did not place them in the public file.

Garrahy was reluctant to immediately turn them over to PolitiFact until he checked whether they were still considered private. But he explained over the phone that while the development agency did eventually receive a check for $96,016.74 to cover most of Ramirez’s loan debt -- as PolitiFact reported Sunday --  the check did not come from Ramirez.

As it turns out, when Ramirez sold the collateral property at 529 Union Ave., the title insurance company failed to discover the lien that the development agency had placed on it.

The lien didn’t come to light until the agency sought to foreclose on the property, which didn’t make its new owner, Larry King, of Warwick, happy. He sued both Ramirez and the agency, alleging that he had been duped.

Ultimately, in January 2007, the title insurance company paid the $96,000 to the development agency and King’s complaint against the development agency was settled.

As for King’s complaint against Ramirez? King’s lawyer Brian LaPlante told us Tuesday it wasn’t pursued because Ramirez filed for bankruptcy.

The development agency also waived the remaining $16,016.74 Ramirez owed it in interest, late fees and penalties.

Our ruling
   
Republican congressional candidate Brendan Doherty said to Cicilline,  ""The Providence Economic Development Partnership . . . which you chaired, loaned $103,000 in taxpayer funds to one of your campaign workers. The worker never paid back the loan.""

It’s true the worker, Ramirez, never paid back the loan. However, Doherty’s statement implies the city got nothing back when in fact it recouped most of his loan obligation.

Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information,  we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F14380>],/factchecks/2012/sep/18/brendan-doherty/brendan-doherty-says-cicilline-campaign-worker-nev/

Is Portland Schools spending half a million dollars to declare the peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich racist?
","
This is something PolitiFact Oregon never thought we’d have to do: Search online for the terms racist sandwich. And what pops up? A Portland Tribune news story about a Portland Public Schools equity program that focuses on diversity as a way to boost student learning.

We repeat the first four paragraphs of the story as is: 
Verenice Gutierrez picks up on the subtle language of racism every day. 
Take the peanut butter sandwich, a seemingly innocent example a teacher used in a lesson last school year. 
""What about Somali or Hispanic students, who might not eat sandwiches?"" says Gutierrez, principal at Harvey Scott K-8 School, a diverse school of 500 students in Northeast Portland’s Cully neighborhood. 
""Another way would be to say: ‘Americans eat peanut butter and jelly, do you have anything like that?’ Let them tell you. Maybe they eat torta. Or pita."" 
The online response has been tremendous.

From Huffington Post: ""Peanut Butter And Jelly Racist? Portland School Principal Ties Sandwich To White Privilege."" And from WTBX/FM in Hibbing, Minn: ""PBJ- the racist sandwich?"" (Summary: Yup. Your childhood staple is guilty of hate crimes against humanity.) Even the liberal Daily Kos weighed in with ""Oregon school principal: Peanut Butter sandwiches RACIST?"" and complained of political correctness gone amok.

And here, posted on conservative breitbart.com: ""Portland Schools spend $500K to deem PB & J sandwiches racist.""

We acknowledge some level of hyperbole. But we still wanted to know: Did the principal in question declare the sandwich racist? And did Portland Schools spend half a million dollars to do so?

The article posted on breitbart was written by the Education Action Group, a Michigan-based organization that dislikes public unions. We called and got Ben Velderman, a communications specialist who wrote the story.

Velderman said he doesn’t know if the principal actually called the sandwiches racist -- which the headline claims. But he points to The Portland Tribune news article, which clearly talks about race and the privilege of the white mainstream.

""So if a peanut butter sandwich is the ‘subtle language of racism,’ I don’t think it’s a stretch that she thinks a peanut butter sandwich is racist,"" he said. ""I try not to be inflammatory. I try to keep it as reasonable as possible, by not making outlandish claims. She went out on a limb herself.""

Gutierrez declined to speak with PolitiFact Oregon, but Portland Public Schools spokesman Matt Shelby answered questions on her behalf. He said she did not use the word ""racist"" in a meeting with staff cited in the news article. He said that the ""subtle language of racism"" phrase included in the story was the reporter’s wording, and not hers. The point of the example, Shelby said, was to encourage teachers to widen their range of food samples to include more students.

""It’s not that the PB&J sandwich is racist. That’s silly,"" he said. The reporter ""asked her about the goal of this work and what her desire was, and she told her that it was to have culturally relevant instruction in every classroom, and what that might look like.

""The work is not to point fingers and figure out what is racist.""

In other words, accusing the sandwich of oppression is quite different from saying that it would be useful to include other foods when talking to students who don’t eat sandwiches for lunch.

Let’s turn briefly to the money involved. Portland Public Schools has an ongoing contract with Pacific Educational Group, whose founder is author of the book, ""Courageous Conversations About Race: A Strategy for Achieving Equity in Schools."" The district has spent more than $1 million since 2007 for diversity and equity training in the classroom. In other words, it’s for more than just the rebranding of a sandwich. (Tigard-Tualatin and other districts use the program as well.)

How fair is it for pundits to take a news story that includes the word racism in the first paragraph and boil that down into a headline about a racist sandwich?

The Education Action Group says it’s fair game, given the story and the fact that an educator singled out the sandwich in a lesson about cultural competency. But come on. Read the original story. Gutierrez is quoted as suggesting to staff: ""Americans eat peanut butter and jelly, do you have anything like that?"" That’s not an indictment of the sandwich.

Portland Public Schools did not spend half a million dollars to label the sandwich ""racist."" The principal never called the sandwich racist. The Portland Tribune never said the principal called the sandwich racist. And yes, we don’t usually weigh in on lunch, but who could resist? The statement is inaccurate and silly.

We rate the statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097718B80>],/factchecks/2012/sep/18/education-action-group/portland-schools-spending-half-million-dollars-dec/
