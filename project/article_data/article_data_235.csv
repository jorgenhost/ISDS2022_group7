Half Flip: Tammy Baldwin partially shifts position on how she considers U.S. Supreme Court nominees
","In her effort to unseat U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin in the Nov. 6, 2018 election,  Republican Leah Vukmir has repeatedly criticized Baldwin for her quick opposition to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and for not meeting with him. That raises a question over whether Baldwin, a first-term Wisconsin Democrat, has been consistent on her consideration of Supreme Court nominees. During her tenure, one nomination was made by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and two were by Republican President Donald Trump. With the Senate expected to vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination before the end of September 2018, let’s go to the Flip-O-Meter to review how Baldwin has considered the three nominees. March 2016: Obama nominated Garland, chief judge of the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. The same day, Baldwin praised Garland, saying he had ""strong federal judicial experience."" She said: ""I now plan to do my job by reviewing Judge Garland’s experience and qualifications for our highest court. I also look forward to meeting with Judge Garland. I hope my Republican colleagues will do the same thing"" and give him ""fair consideration."" April 2016: Baldwin met with Garland, saying it ""strengthened my conviction that this is a very well qualified and experienced judge who deserves a hearing and a vote."" January 2017: Garland’s nomination expired with the Republican-led Senate refusing to hold a confirmation hearing or vote -- leaving the seat open for Trump to fill. So, Baldwin didn’t state a position on Garland’s nomination and she met with him, prior to any possibility of confirmation hearings being held. And she made a point of saying those not of the same party as the president -- in this case, Republican senators -- should consider Garland’s full record, give it ""fair consideration"" and meet with him. That would change with the next two nominees. January 2017: Trump announced Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge in Colorado, as his nominee. The same day, Baldwin criticized the choice, saying Gorsuch had a ""deeply troubling record. But she also said she would ""fully review"" the record, meet with Gorsuch and give his nomination ""fair consideration."" Two days later, however, Baldwin said she not only would vote against Gorsuch, she would filibuster the pick by forcing Republicans to meet a 60-vote threshold to confirm him. Baldwin said Gorsuch did not have a ""mainstream record"" and cited judicial rulings of his on cases involving disabled students, workers and women’s reproductive health. February 2017: Baldwin met with Gorsuch and reiterated her plans to vote against him and to support a filibuster against his nomination. The Senate held its confirmation hearing for Gorsuch the next month and he was confirmed by the Senate the following month. To overcome the filibuster, Republicans deployed the so-called nuclear option, voting to lower the threshold for advancing Supreme Court nominations from 60 votes to a simple majority. So, as she did with Garland, Baldwin met with Gorsuch before his confirmation hearing  — but it’s hard to argue that the meeting was part of Baldwin giving ""fair consideration"" to Gorsuch, since she had already come out against him. July 2018: Trump nominated Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge in Washington, D.C. He would replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. The same day, Baldwin said she would review his nomination with an eye toward women’s health and other issues. Three days later, Baldwin announced she would not support Kavanaugh, saying he was backed by ""powerful special interests."" Her statement did not make mention of whether she would meet with him. August 2018: Baldwin reiterated her plans to vote against Kavanaugh, but said she plans to meet with him. She had not done so, however, before his confirmation hearing, which was held in early September 2018. Her campaign told us that Baldwin’s Senate office has reached out to the White House about a meeting but hasn’t received a response. However, other Democratic senators have met with Kavanaugh. Baldwin met with Garland, who was nominated by Obama, and urged GOP senators to consider his record and to meet with him. She didn’t announce a position on the nomination of Garland, who ultimately was denied a vote by the GOP-controlled Senate. But with Gorsuch, who was nominated by Trump, Baldwin announced her opposition almost immediately -- lessening the value of meeting with him, in terms of giving his nomination consideration, though she did meet with him, prior to his confirmation hearing. With Trump nominee Kavanaugh, Baldwin also announced her opposition almost immediately. She says she plans to meet with him, but no meeting occurred before his confirmation hearing. Baldwin’s approach to how she considers Supreme Court nominees has varied in each of the three cases -- with a notable shift for those nominated by a Republican. For a partial change in position, we give her a Half Flip.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B32A40>],/factchecks/2018/sep/13/tammy-baldwin/half-flip-tammy-baldwin-partially-shifts-position-/

Scott Walker misleads in claiming Tony Evers could have revoked teacher license in porn viewing case
","It hasn’t reached the ubiquity  — yet — of advertising on NASCAR race cars. But in the race for governor, advertising about a teacher viewing porn case is all over television. There have been three ads on the case that we’ve checked attacking Tony Evers, the state schools superintendent and Democratic candidate for governor. Each were by the state Republican Party, with one dating back more than a year. There also have been two TV ads on the case that we’ve checked from two groups defending Evers, who will face Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the Nov. 6, 2018, election. Now comes another attack ad, this one from Walker, released Sept. 5, 2018. The narrator goes into lengthy detail, saying: A teacher watched hard-core pornography in his classroom, showed obscene images to female coworkers, commented about the chest sizes of middle-school girls, suggested one struggling student should brush up on her sex skills because it's the only thing she'd ever be good at -- then intimidated the female teacher who complained. Tony Evers should have revoked the teacher's license, but he didn't, and the teacher is still in the classroom with young girls. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. We’ll break down the statement into two parts: ""A teacher watched hard-core pornography in his classroom,"" along with other inappropriate behavior, but Tony Evers didn't revoke the teacher's license and ""the teacher is still in the classroom."" Like the other ads, this one focuses on Andy Harris, a middle-school science teacher in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison. He was fired in 2010 for viewing images and videos of nudity on his school computer and showing them to co-workers.

Harris got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he should have been given a suspension rather than be fired. Two courts, without ruling on whether the firing was illegal, concluded that the arbitrator was within her authority in making her decision. The arbitrator based her decision in part on her determination that Harris’ behavior, given that students were not present when he viewed the images, did not endanger any students, as defined by state law. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Now to what Walker’s ad claims about the teacher’s behavior. We’re relying on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news reports on the case, the arbitrator’s report and the school district’s investigation of the case. ‘Watched hard-core pornography in classroom’: Correct, though ""hard-core"" might be debatable. Harris looked at pornographic material at school during the workday, via 23 emails sent by Harris' sister, that included pornographic photos, jokes and movies. ‘Showed obscene images to female co-workers’: Correct. Commented about chest sizes, sex skills: Undetermined. In the school district’s investigation, an unidentified employee said Harris made the remarks. But the Department of Public Instruction, which Evers heads, said neither the arbitrator nor the department could determine whether Harris made the remarks. ‘Intimidated the female teacher who complained’: Correct. The teacher who complained said Harris could sometimes be intimidating. The district’s investigation found that emails Harris sent to the teacher ""suggests retaliation,"" but Harris denied they were retaliatory. So, the first part of Walker’s claim is partially accurate. But the second part is more important, given that it contains the attack on Evers. This part of the ad states — particularly in saying Evers should have revoked Harris’ license  — that even though the legal system returned the teacher to his job, Evers had the power to stop him from teaching. But when Harris was fired, state law defined immoral conduct, according to the Legislature’s nonpartisan legal advisers, ""as conduct or behavior that is contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards and that endangers the health, safety, welfare, or education of any pupil."" And is the pivotal word. Evers’ department did have the discretion on whether to go through license revocation proceedings, which Harris could have challenged. The department has said it decided against that course after concluding Harris’ behavior didn’t endanger kids, as defined by the law. Walker, in effect, argues that Evers nevertheless should have tried revocation. But the lack of a legal basis to take away Harris’ license appears to be supported by the fact that in November 2011, nearly a year after Harris’ firing, Walker signed a bill, supported by Evers, that redefined immoral conduct to specify that what Harris did is legal cause for license revocation. So, the second part of Walker’s statement is misleading in claiming that Evers could have revoked Harris’ license and simply didn’t. (Before he was fired, Harris taught seventh-grade science at one of the district’s two middle schools; now he has the same job at the other.) Walker says: ""A teacher watched hard-core pornography in his classroom,"" along with other inappropriate behavior, but Tony Evers didn't revoke the teacher's license and ""the teacher is still in the classroom."" The first part of Walker’s statement, about the teacher’s behavior, is correct on two points; but on two other points, the validity of the allegations is unclear. Meanwhile, the more important part of Walker’s statement is misleading in saying Evers could have and didn’t revoke the teacher’s license. There was a lack of legal basis for revocation at the time — made clear by the fact that Walkers and Evers backed a change in state law so that teachers can be fired for viewing pornography at school. For a statement that contains only elements of truth, our rating is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AA88C0>],/factchecks/2018/sep/13/scott-walker/scott-walker-misleads-claiming-tony-evers-could-ha/

Did Indiana's Joe Donnelly vote to grant amnesty to criminals?
","A digital ad by One Nation, a Republican PAC, in the Indiana Senate campaign claims Democrat Joe Donnelly flip-flopped on the issue of amnesty for illegal immigrants. ""In Congress, Joe Donnelly claimed he was 100 percent opposed to amnesty and promised to send back any illegal immigrant who commits a crime,"" the narrator says as a hooded man walks along a dark sidewalk holding a knife on screen. ""But in the Senate, Donnelly voted to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, including criminals, drunk drivers, domestic violence, and worse,"" the narrator continues as a man climbs over a tall fence and another is handcuffed. Donnelly has frequently stated he opposes granting amnesty to criminals. So did he really vote to let them legalize their status? The bill in question is the 2013 Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, which gave provisional legal status to those who entered the country illegally. The legislation was a major bipartisan compromise from a group known as the Gang of 8, which included Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio. Donnelly voted in favor. While it passed the Senate, it never reached a vote in the House. The Donnelly campaign said Donnelly has consistently opposed amnesty and said this bill did not grant amnesty. He supported it because it increased border security. ""He only supported the 2013 bill because it wasn't amnesty and instead placed renewed focus on identifying and deporting hardened criminals -- including drunk drivers and domestic abusers,"" said Will Baskin-Gerwitz, Donnelly’s spokesman. Amnesty is a tricky word. Experts told us earned path to legalization was more appropriate in this case. In addition to border security, the bill did provide a way for people in the country illegally to apply for legal status. The bill allowed qualified unauthorized immigrants to apply for registered provisional immigrant status. After 10 years, they could apply for a green card. Eligible for that status were undocumented immigrants who had been in the United States since Dec. 31, 2011, paid their assessed taxes, passed background checks, and paid application fees and a $1,000 penalty. Prohibited from the path to citizenship were those convicted of three or more misdemeanor offenses, as well as those convicted of felonies, certain foreign offenses or unlawful voting. The ad said Donnelly granted amnesty to criminals, drunk drivers, and perpetrators of domestic violence. That’s not the case. Criminal is a loaded term, as it may bring to mind a person with a serious criminal record. Legally, a misdemeanor is a crime. So technically, a person with a misdemeanor would be considered a criminal. The legality of the images on screen vary. Carrying a knife isn’t a crime, but stabbing someone is a felony. Trespassing is generally a misdemeanor, depending where the person is trespassing. A person with a record of two misdemeanor charges could apply for provisional legal status, while the third count would make them ineligible. As for drunk driving and domestic violence, James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University, said they could be considered a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on the state in which they occurred and sometimes, the level of violence. But the bill had more specific language carved out for those crimes. It said that a person with three or more drunk driving offenses was inadmissible. They would also be ineligible if they served at least one year in prison for domestic violence, or were convicted for it more than once. U.S. Rep. John Cornyn, R-Texas, introduced an amendment that curbed the criminal allowances using stronger language; anyone convicted of domestic violence or drunk driving would be ineligible. Donnelly voted against Cornyn's amendment. ""Without the amendment, more individuals convicted of crimes, including domestic violence and drunk driving, would get to apply for legalization,"" said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. Experts told us Cornyn's amendment was a poison pill that would have made the legalization program impossible. It would have required before legalization could move forward a 90 percent apprehension rate at the Southern border. ""The 90 percent standard, for example, was intended to sink the bill by creating an impossible standard,"" said Ian Ostrander, a political science professor at Michigan State University. ""Often these amendments are created with the intended purpose of using the motion to table vote in a campaign ad."" One Nation said, ""In the Senate, Donnelly voted to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, including criminals, drunk drivers, domestic violence, and worse."" Donnelly’s vote for the immigration bill excluded drunk drivers with multiple offenses and those convicted of domestic violence from the path to citizenship. He voted against an amendment that would have excluded more people charged with such crimes from attaining citizenship. The ad makes it seem that Donnelly purposely protected all undocumented immigrants convicted of domestic violence and drunk driving. The vote he cast still went after them, but in a less severe way than the Cornyn amendment proposed.

"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Florida Democratic Party']","
Fact-checking Rick Scott and the risk to pre-existing condition protections
","One of the Democrats’ key messages for the midterm elections is that Republicans are poised to take away Americans’ health coverage. The Florida Democratic Party picked up on that theme in a tweet about the U.S. Senate race in Florida between Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott. The Sept. 5 tweet said, ""Nearly 7 million Floridians have pre-existing conditions — but Rick Scott and Florida Republicans wants to take away their health care coverage by ending the Affordable Care Act."" (The grammatically incorrect ""wants"" is in the original.) Nearly 7 million Floridians have pre-existing conditions — but Rick Scott and Florida Republicans wants to take away their health care coverage by ending the Affordable Care Act. pic.twitter.com/T8DDVNIo5p The Florida Democratic Party has a point that a Republican-backed lawsuit threatens the existence of the Affordable Care Act, the law signed by President Barack Obama that expands health care access and prevents insurers from denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions. However, the tweet cites a number -- 7 million -- that exaggerates how many Floridians could lose their coverage under the law. The lawsuit, filed in a U.S. district court in Texas on Feb. 26, 2018, was signed by 18 attorneys general and two governors, all of them Republicans. The suit challenges the Affordable Care Act, arguing that ""the ACA is unlawful"" and seeking to enjoin, or block, its operation. The legal argument is that in 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the law’s individual mandate to purchase health insurance by saying it was enforced by a tax penalty, but in 2017, Congress repealed the mechanism to enforce the individual mandate through the tax code. The lawsuit contends that -- with the tax penalty now gone -- the individual mandate is no longer constitutional and, as a result, the law should be either largely or entirely thrown out. If the plaintiffs’ wishes are granted by the courts, then insurance companies would be able to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. So the tweet raises a genuine issue. Repealing the Affordable Care Act has long been a signature issue for Scott, though he’s often walked a tightrope, rhetorically backing protections for pre-existing conditions -- which are politically popular -- even as he advocated policies that would endanger those protections. When Scott faced Democrat Charlie Crist in the 2014 gubernatorial race, Crist said that ""Rick Scott wants to take us back to the days of insurance companies denying coverage for pre-existing conditions."" PolitiFact Florida rated Crist’s charge Mostly True. We found that Scott -- a former health care executive -- had not only urged the law’s repeal, but that he had made several comments in 2012 that urged giving individuals tax breaks to buy their own health insurance ""so they won't have to deal with the pre-existing conditions."" Health policy experts countered that plans that cover pre-existing conditions likely wouldn’t be available or affordable unless the law mandated that companies offer them. Last year, as congressional Republicans were considering repealing the law, Scott wrote an op-ed that said, ""There is absolutely no question that Obamacare must be repealed immediately so Americans can actually afford to purchase health insurance."" After the repeal effort failed, a spokeswoman reaffirmed his support for repeal to the Orlando Sentinel. In June 2018, as he pursued his run for the U.S. Senate -- and faced criticism about some of his health care policy stances -- Scott said that despite his pro-repeal efforts, he didn’t want to get rid of pre-existing condition protections. ""I've continued to say that it is important to cover individuals with pre-existing conditions and that every American, including those with pre-existing conditions, should have the ability to buy any kind of insurance they want,"" Scott said. ""Obamacare is a disaster and costs way too much, but keeping pre-existing provisions should be a part of any healthcare reform. I disagree with efforts to dismantle protections for those with preexisting conditions."" Scott spokeswoman Lauren Schenone added to PolitiFact that Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi is independently elected and chose to join the lawsuit on her own. ""Gov. Scott’s administration did not have input,"" she said. Health policy analysts, however, are skeptical that Scott’s longstanding position in favor of repeal is compatible with keeping robust protections for pre-existing conditions. At the very least, a court decision could force lawmakers to pass a new law covering pre-existing conditions, something that’s rarely simple to do. ""There would be much more damage beyond the issue of people with health problems being denied coverage, but that would in fact be one outcome,"" Linda Blumberg, a health policy analyst at the Urban Institute, told PolitiFact in June. Blumberg said that if you got rid of insurance regulations like those in the ACA and then tried to require insurers to cover all comers -- a policy known as ""guaranteed issue"" -- then ""insurers would respond by setting their premiums so high"" that they’d be out of reach for most customers, and/or ""offer extremely high deductibles and other types of out-of-pocket requirements."" The impact of a court ruling would take time to filter through the health insurance system, but the scale is potentially large, she said. Which brings us to the other part of the Florida Democrats’ assertion. In theory, getting rid of the pre-existing condition protections for good could affect any Floridian under 65 at some point in the future. But if you look at near-term effects, the Florida Democratic Party is on less solid ground. (We looked at a similar question raised by the Missouri Democratic Party in their state’s U.S. Senate race.) A report published in April 2017 by the liberal Center for American Progress found that 7.8 million Floridians are living with a pre-existing condition. But this was based on the more expansive of two definitions offered in a study released by the Department of Health and Human Services in the waning days of the Obama administration. This definition included people who had ""common health conditions … that could have resulted in denial of coverage, exclusion of the condition, or higher premiums for individuals seeking individual market coverage"" before the Affordable Care Act was enacted. A narrower definition used by HHS -- which only included conditions that would cause an applicant to be ""outright rejected for coverage by private insurers"" -- would have produced a figure for Florida of roughly half that number. This is important because the language of the Florida Democrats’ tweet -- that Scott and Republicans want to ""take away"" health coverage -- sounds more like the narrower definition Another independent estimate, by the Kaiser Family Foundation, produced a figure for Florida of about 3.1 million people. Meanwhile, a large fraction of people with pre-existing conditions are insured through an employer or through Medicaid, meaning that they could not be denied coverage immediately after the lawsuit became successful and changed the law, said Christine Eibner, a senior economist specializing in health policy with the Rand Corp. Someone who currently has employer coverage or Medicaid would have to lose their existing coverage first even to be considered at risk for losing out due to the lawsuit. The number of Floridians insured on the non-group market -- the market that the Affordable Care Act opened access to, and, where the possibility of being denied or facing higher premiums for pre-existing conditions is the most acute -- is 2.1 million, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The Florida Democratic Party said, ""Nearly 7 million Floridians have pre-existing conditions — but Rick Scott and Florida Republicans wants to take away their health care coverage by ending the Affordable Care Act."" Scott says he’s in favor of preserving pre-existing condition protections, but he’s a longtime supporter of repealing the law that enshrines them, which means he’s pursuing a policy that endangers those protections. Meanwhile, the 7 million figure exaggerates the number of people who would be at immediate risk of seeing their coverage taken away shortly after an adverse court decision. That number might be closer to 2 million -- a large figure, but substantially smaller than what the tweet said.

"['Ohio', 'Health Care', 'Aftab Pureval']","
Chabot’s votes contradict his health care talk
","With their race squeaky tight, accusatory fingers are being pointed between Steve Chabot, the Republican incumbent in Ohio’s 1st Congressional District, and his Democratic challenger, Aftab Pureval. Two TV ads from Pureval, one with an on-camera assist from a mother whose now-teen-age daughter had cancer at age 7, claim that Chabot voted to strip mandatory health insurance protections for people for pre-existing conditions. That could have led to exorbitant premiums for the sickest Americans or denial of coverage altogether. It’s as if Chabot would have punished the child throughout her life for successfully fighting cancer, the mother says in the ad. The mother, Colleen Bowman, and her daughter, Ella Bowman, now 14, are seated on a couch next to Pureval, who begins the commercial saying, ""Thank you so much for trusting me with your story."" Then over the sound of music box-like piano and violin, the mother says, ""Like I said in many letters and messages to Steve Chabot, if they take away the pre-existing condition protections, you’re punishing the child cancer survivor for surviving cancer. That’s pretty disgusting."" Yet that’s exactly what Chabot would have done, Pureval contended in a different ad about a week earlier: ""Steve Chabot, a career politician who voted to strip away protections for people with pre-existing conditions,"" that ad’s announcer said. Chabot shot back in his own ad, with an announcer saying, ""Aftab Pureval just can’t seem the tell the truth. He’s lying about Steve Chabot’s health care record."" Sounds like it’s time for a fact-check. To understand Pureval’s health care claim, we need to start with the basics of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, signed by President Barack Obama. It required most Americans to have health insurance, and health insurers had to cover any patient who applied and paid premiums. Some of those premiums were covered by taxpayer subsidies. The act, known in shorthand as both the ACA and Obamacare, prohibited charging premiums based on an applicant’s health status or prior medical conditions. It allowed insurers to charge higher premiums for their oldest members, but no more than three times as high as premiums charged for the youngest members. Republicans including Chabot disliked the ACA from the start. It was economically unsustainable, they said, and while Obama claimed premiums would go down, they went up for a number of families, and some were forced to buy coverage they didn’t want. Furthermore, congressional critics said, it was an assault on the ideals of free markets and individual choice. So they tried to repeal it. They voted multiple times, generally garnering enough votes for passage in the House, which Republicans retook in the late 2010 election, but failing in the Senate. Chabot voted with the majority. Therefore, Pureval says, Chabot voted to strip protections from people with pre-existing conditions. Chabot’s record of rhetoric, however, is more complex. He has spoken about keeping protections for pre-existing conditions. Counters the Pureval campaign: Talk is cheap. Votes are what matter. In Pureval’s ad that started running Aug. 28, three of Chabot’s votes are shown scrolling down the screen. H.R. 2, the ""Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act."" The text of the bill spoke entirely of repeal and did not state a desire or intention to keep any provisions. It passed 249-189 on Jan. 19, 2011, almost entirely along partisan lines. H.R. 6079, the ""Repeal of Obamacare Act"" of 2012, cited numerous criticisms of the ACA and called for restoring pre-ACA rules as if Obamacare ""had not been enacted."" It did not discuss pre-existing conditions. The House passed it 244-185, with every Republican voting ""yes."" H.R. 569, a 2015 bill with a lengthy name but the same stated purpose: to repeal the ACA. This bill, however, spoke of ""replacement legislation"" and ordered that four separate House committees work on new components. One of provisions lawmakers would work on if the broader repeal bill passed first: ""Provide people with pre-existing conditions access to affordable health coverage."" On a partisan vote, H.R. 569 passed the House 239-186. Chabot says he never wanted to end the protection for people with pre-existing conditions. In 2017, for example, House Republicans passed H.R 1628, the American Health Care Act, with a vote of 217-213. It would give ""states the ability, if they choose, to craft health care solutions that work better for local patients, while at the same time guaranteeing that those with pre-existing conditions cannot be denied health care coverage,"" Chabot said in a statement after the vote. In 2014, Chabot endorsed a list of possible ACA alternatives, writing in the Cincinnati Enquirer that they could include ""allowing young people to stay on their parents' insurance policies until age 26 and addressing the pre-existing condition challenge."" In December 2013, Chabot and 33 other Republicans wrote to Obama seeking a meeting to discuss health care reform, with a proposed agenda that included ""guaranteeing people with pre-existing conditions can get affordable coverage."" In an ideal world, talk might equal action. But that’s Pureval’s very contention: Despite Chabot’s talk, the incumbent voted to repeal the ACA without assuring there would be protections for people with preexisting conditions. The Cincinnati Enquirer made a similar point in 2011, shortly before that first 2011 repeal vote. ""Chabot acknowledged that certain changes are needed,"" the news article said, citing Chabot’s agreement on the ""need to prohibit insurers from denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions, canceling coverage once an insured person gets sick, and allow parents to keep children on their policy until age 26. ""But he acknowledged that there aren't any current plans for the House to enact those changes if a repeal passes,"" the article noted. Chabot voted for it anyway. Even the 2017 repeal-and-replace bill, the American Health Care Act, had potential weaknesses. A Columbus Dispatch article on the bill pointed out that if someone with a pre-existing condition bought a policy on the insurance exchanges ""but let it lapse for more than 63 days, the insurance company could charge a higher premium."" Similarly, the 2015 vote that required congressional committees to work on replacement bills did nothing to assure any such replacement bills would ever get a hearing, much less a vote, Sarah Topy, Pureval’s campaign manager, said in an email to PolitiFact. It was just more rhetoric, she said. Chabot’s response to all this is unusual: Yes, he voted for Obamacare repeal bills that did not include keeping protections for pre-existing conditions, but Republicans and Democrats alike knew those bills could not pass the Senate or get Obama’s signature. Votes like this were part of a legislative strategy but, Chabot’s campaign said, few lawmakers really meant it when they said only ""repeal"" and not ""replace."" ""Here's the thing,"" Chabot campaign spokesman Cody Rizzuto said in an email to PolitiFact. ""Everyone knew that none of these votes were going anywhere as long as President Obama was in the White House."" He added that ""the votes Aftab cites were all taken while President Obama was in office.  As such, they weren't going to be become law. Obamacare wasn't going to be repealed with President Obama's signature. Everyone knew that, and so a replacement bill wasn't necessary. You don't need a replace when there won't be a repeal."" The nature of the bills and the addition of replacement language changed, he said, once Republicans regained a Senate majority and then Donald Trump was elected president. With a real chance of passage, Rizzuto said, the bills focused more specifically on individual elements. He added that while Pureval attacked Chabot on pre-existing conditions, he did so without ever mentioning that the actual votes were on Obamacare. ""Aftab is relying on votes repealing an unpopular program, without ever mentioning that program (Obamacare),"" Rizzuto said. ""This is intentional, because tying the issue to Obamacare repeal would directly undermine his attack in this district.    Chabot has said repeatedly that he would like to have protections covering people with pre-existing conditions. When presented with bills that lacked the protections, however, he has voted for them anyway. His campaign says the votes weren’t meaningful because the legislation was never going to become law and everyone knew it. We cannot say that when Congress members, elected to make laws, vote for a new law, constituents should take it with a grain of salt. There are certainly political and strategic calculations. The Truth-O-Meter can only measure what a politician says and what he or she did. The connection between the ACA and pre-existing conditions was eminently clear throughout the repeal debate.

Gavin Newsom’s misleading claim on John Cox ‘parroting’ Trump on family separations
","In his run for California governor, Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has repeatedly tried to tie his Republican opponent John Cox to President Trump’s most hardline immigration policies. Newsom did just that in a recent TV interview. He claimed Cox, a San Diego businessman who Trump has endorsed, has ""parroted"" Trump on the president’s controversial family separation policy for those who illegally cross the border. Newsom made the assertion immediately after discussing Cox’s policies, implying that his Republican rival fully supports separating immigrant families. ""Even by relatively moderate positions in the Republican party in California, he’s on the extreme of those positions,"" Newsom told ABC7 in Los Angeles on Aug. 17, 2018. ""He can’t run away from Trump. He parroted, parroted Trump—almost verbatim—on the children’s separation issues at the border.""  Newsom makes his claim in the ABC7 TV interview above.  We fact-checked the last portion of Newsom’s statement. Our research It’s not clear which specific words Newsom believes Cox has ""parroted."" That’s because Trump has made many claims about the child separation policy, some of which blame Democrats in Congress for forcing the crisis. Thousands of children were taken from their parents and sent to detention centers this spring after their families crossed the border. Though Trump eventually ended the policy, hundreds of children remain separated. Trump has also claimed the problem could be solved if people ""Don't come to our country illegally. Come like other people do. Come legally.""   Still, the implication in Newsom’s statement is straigtforward: That Cox and Trump share the same words and viewpoints on the policy. Cox says he's opposed There’s one big problem: Cox clearly stated his opposition to separating families at a June press conference at the state Capitol. The conference and proceeding rally was organized in support of repealing the state’s gas tax increase, one of Cox’s top causes. ""I'm against separating parents and children, I'm a father. I have four daughters. That's a congressional problem,"" Cox told reporters. ""I hope we get a congressional solution very soon. He later added: ""I’m about solutions. … I hope Congress solves that problem, as well, and I’ll work with it."" Asked the same month on KGO Radio about the policy, Cox said: ""I would certainly add my voice to try and keep parents and children together."" Cox was again asked whether he supports separating children from families in an August TV interview on Bloomberg Politics. He did not offer an explicit answer, but said: ""I support getting a solution."" None of the responses show Cox favors the policy. To support Newsom’s claim, his spokesman Nathan Click pointed to a June Sacramento Bee article that covered Cox’s comments at the June press conference. The article begins this way: Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox on Monday backed President Donald Trump's stance on separating immigrant parents from their children at the border, saying, ""that's a congressional problem."" Cox is quoted later in the article saying he’s ""against"" separating families. In an email, Cox’s spokesman Matt Shupe wrote that Newsom’s statement is ""100 percent FALSE."" Who’s to blame?  Setting aside the key context that Cox has opposed the policy, we examined whether Cox’s words in any other way ""parrot"" Trump’s, as Newsom stated. We found Cox and Trump both say that Congress must solve family separations. But even on this point, there’s a degree of difference. Trump has focused his blame mostly on Democrats in Congress, while Cox hasn’t been that specific. On May 26, Trump tweeted: Then, on June 16, Trump tweeted:  PolitiFact and other news organizations have debunked Trump’s false claim that Democrats or others in Congress passed a law that forced the family separations. They have noted the Trump administration is responsible for its own policy. ""There is no such law,"" PolitiFact National wrote in a recent fact check. ""The Homeland Security Department’s longstanding policy is to separate children from their custodians when they are referred for criminal prosecution. Trump’s administration has decided to prosecute all illegal crossings. Families were rarely prosecuted under previous administrations."" Our ruling  Democrat Gavin Newsom recently claimed his GOP opponent for governor John Cox ""parroted"" President Trump on the issue of family separations at the border. His statement, made right after a discussion of Cox’s policies, wrongly implies Cox supports separating immigrant families. Cox has repeatedly stated he opposes the policy. Cox and Trump have both said Congress should solve the issue, offering one parallel between the two. But even on this point, they’re not in lock-step. Trump has falsely blamed Democrats in Congress for forcing the separations, while Cox hasn’t made that specific charge. If anything, Cox has ""parroted"" one of Trump’s talking points about who should solve the problem. But he hasn’t backed Trump’s policy. Newsom’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

"['Debt', 'Deficit', 'PunditFact', 'Joe Scarborough']","
Will Trump, GOP create more debt in one year than in first 200 years of U.S.?
","  Joe Scarborough, co-host of the MSNBC show Morning Joe, penned a reflective column for the Washington Post on Sept. 11, 2018, headlined, ""Trump is harming the dream of America more than any foreign adversary ever could."" Here’s a portion of the column: ""Seventeen years (after the 9/11 attacks), endless wars abroad and reckless policies at home have produced annual deficits approaching $1 trillion. President Trump’s Republican Party will create more debt in one year than was generated in the first 200 years of America’s existence. And while the United States has been mired in endless wars and bloody occupations over the past 17 years, China has used that same period to aggressively develop economic partnerships across Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa. Perhaps that is one reason China will soon overtake the United States as the world’s largest economy."" It's a common refrain, regardless of who's in the White House. In February 2016, we rated Mostly True a statement by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush that ""Barack Obama will somehow manage to add more than $8 trillion to the national debt, which is more debt than the 43 presidents who held office before him compiled together."" So is it really true that ""President Trump’s Republican Party will create more debt in one year than was generated in the first 200 years of America’s existence""? Pretty much. A few preliminaries. First, there are two common measures for debt. One, called public debt, tallies up the debt held by the public, while gross federal debt is a larger figure that combines publicly held debt plus debt held by the government itself, such as in the Social Security or Medicare trust funds. Both figures are considered legitimate, and since Scarborough didn’t specify which one she was referring to, we’ll run the numbers for both categories of debt. Because debt is cumulative (minus any intervening surpluses) the debt level at the end of a given time period is the cumulative debt up to that point -- you don’t have to add the yearly figures for debt to get the figure Scarborough is referencing. The first question to answer is, when do you start counting to calculate debt for ""the first 200 years of America’s existence""? (An NBC spokesman didn’t respond to an inquiry.) Probably the most obvious way to do it is to look at the cumulative debt between 1776, the date of the Declaration of Independence, and 1976, the national bicentennial year. At the end of 1976, the public debt was $477.4 billion, and the gross federal debt was just under $629 billion. So how does that compare to Trump’s record? The amount of public debt added in 2017 -- a year when Trump was president for all but 20 days and when the Republicans were in control of Congress -- was $497.8 billion, while the amount of gross federal debt added was $666.3 billion. Whichever variety of debt you use, the amount of debt added under Republican control in 2017 was greater than the accumulated debt by the end of 1976, making Scarborough’s statement correct. (Economists do not typically adjust debt figures for inflation; the figures cited above are nominal dollars.) Meanwhile, projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office suggest that the size of the debt under Trump will only grow from what it was in 2017. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, the debt is projected to increase by more than $1 trillion in each year. Some might suggest starting the clock in 1788 -- when the Constitution was ratified -- and stopping it in 1988, rather than starting with pre-Revolutionary War independence. In that scenario, the accumulated public debt over 200 years would be $2.1 trillion and the accumulated general debt would be $2.6 trillion. That would make Scarborough’s calculation incorrect. However, ""I think most people would say America began its existence in 1776,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. Beyond the starting date, we see a few caveats. First, Scarborough lays the blame entirely at the Republicans’ feet. However, decisions made by Democrats or by both parties long before Trump’s tenure have shaped how much was added to the debt in 2017. Net interest on the debt accounted for 6.6 percent of federal spending in 2017, and mandatory spending -- outlays that are essentially on autopilot, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- accounted for an additional 63.3 percent of federal spending. So the broad outlines of today’s spending picture were not solely set by today’s Republican congressional majorities and Republican president. Second, the inevitable grind of inflation and population growth puts an upward pressure on the scale of the debt. Unless and until the United States reverses course and starts paying down the debt, every new president will preside over ever-larger amounts of debt. A better way to look at debt is by measuring debt as a percentage of gross domestic product, Ellis said. That’s because a more economically productive country can more easily carry a big debt load. And how do those figures look? Here’s a chart. As the chart shows, the current level of debt as a percentage of GDP is not unprecedented (it was higher around World War II) and its growth has eased recently since a spike after the Great Recession. The recession both fed higher spending on the national safety net and weakened the denominator, which is gross domestic product. The chart does show that, when looking at a percentage of GDP, Scarborough is correct in his comparison. Debt as a percentage of GDP in 2017 was far higher (almost 77 percent)  than it was in 1976 (about 27 percent). Scarborough said, ""President Trump’s Republican Party will create more debt in one year than was generated in the first 200 years of America’s existence."" If you use the period 1776 to 1976, Scarborough is correct. However, it’s worth noting that much of today’s debt picture owes something to guidelines for mandatory spending and net interest for past debts, both of which were shaped by both parties. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DDE900>],/factchecks/2018/sep/12/joe-scarborough/will-trump-gop-create-more-debt-one-year-first-200/

The facts on Beto O'Rourke and flags in the Texas Senate race
","Two people asked to take down the American and Texas flags before a campaign rally in Navasota, Texas, but whether they were with the candidate’s campaign is unclear. Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke held a town hall at the Navasota Veterans of Foreign Wars post on Aug. 25. O’Rourke is looking to unseat one-term incumbent and 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2018 midterm election. The Navasota Examiner article about the rally quoted the VFW post commander Carl Dry about a request he says he received while the O’Rourke campaign was setting up for the event. ""They wanted to open the doors (to the Flight Deck Lounge), and I couldn’t allow that, and they wanted to take the flags down. I didn’t only say no, I said hell no, you don’t take the flags off the wall,"" Dry is quoted saying in the newspaper. ""I can’t believe any American would ask us to do that, and I don’t know why he wanted them down or what he was going to put up instead."" Websites such as TopStoriesUSA.com picked up Dry’s quote in early September, saying that the O’Rourke campaign had made the flag removal request and that the request showed a theme of the campaign’s ""aversion to the American flag"" and patriotic symbols. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its newsfeed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) TopStoriesUSA.com editor Vic Medina attributed the content of the site’s story ""Beto O’Rourke Campaign told Texas VFW to remove their American flag"" to The Examiner report. ""Dry does not identify specifically who on O'Rourke's campaign made the request, or if O'Rourke himself made the request of him,"" Medina said. The O’Rourke campaign didn't respond to our inquiry, but the campaign has denied making the request to remove the flags before the rally.  ""Our campaign absolutely did not request that any flags be removed or taken down from the walls,"" campaign spokesman Chris Evans wrote in an email to the Bryan-College Station Eagle newspaper. ""It is incorrect to say that we did. We have hosted dozens of town halls in VFW posts across the state, and always ensure that the flags are prominently and respectfully displayed."" Dry told us two people, about 10 minutes apart, asked him to remove the American and Texas flags before the event. He said they were not wearing name tags or other identifiers related to the O’Rourke campaign. Dry said he assumed the two individuals were part of the campaign because they came to him from the room where the event was being held and returned to it after he told the first ""no,"" and the second ""hell, no."" ""I had to assume they were Mr. O’Rourke’s campaign people,"" Dry said. ""Whether they were or not, I don’t know. I did not ask."" The TopStoriesUSA.com story also speculates that ""there seems to be an aversion to the American flag and symbols of patriotism"" with O’Rourke’s campaign and that the event ""was attracting some that might have been offended to see the American and Texas flags on display behind O’Rourke."" O’Rourke’s campaign is not distancing itself from the American flag. The most prominent image on the campaign website’s homepage is a photo of O’Rourke, with the American flag behind him. He performed at a July 4 concert this year with Willie Nelson in front of the flag. There are also numerous photos and videos on social media of him speaking in front of the American and Texas flags from other events this summer. It’s not unreasonable to assume, as Dry did, that the people who asked to ""take down"" the American flags at the Aug. 25 rally were from the O’Rourke campaign. But it is an assumption, and furthermore it’s not clear why they were asking: It’s possible they wanted to move them to another location or feature them in some other way. We can say that the campaign definitely does not show an ""aversion"" to the flag or to patriotic symbols, as it has used them in many other settings.

Fact-checking attack on Mike DeWine about ECOT online school in Ohio
","A union group says Ohio Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine took campaign donations from an online charter school and ignored that the school was ripping off taxpayers. ""For years Attorney General Mike DeWine took campaign contributions from ECOT associates and did nothing while the online for-profit school lied about enrollment and took millions meant for our kids,"" said the narrator of the TV ad by AFSCME People, the union’s political action fund. The text on the screen listed the amount of $40,000 and stated ""CEO of ECOT donated to DeWine campaign."" Then the ad goes in for the kill: ""It was DeWine’s job to protect us, but instead he chose donors over our kids."" The ad is referring to the Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow, an online school known as ECOT, which closed earlier this year after a long-stemming enrollment inflation scandal. DeWine is running for governor against Democrat Richard Cordray. The school’s downfall is a cautionary tale: Public officials ignored multiple newspaper reports and audits throwing up red flags about the school starting back in the early 2000s. • Yes, DeWine took money from ECOT officials, but he later donated the money he received from ECOT's CEO. • AFSCME, the ad’s maker, is largely counting donations that DeWine’s running mate received many years ago. • DeWine did eventually take legal action against ECOT for inflating its enrollment, although he could have done it earlier. • Many parts of state government share blame for what happened. A long list of politicians and state officials waited many years to take action. The Columbus public online school launched in 2000. News reports showed the school had problems with poor record keeping, suspicious attendance reports, and inflated enrollment. State audits showed problems as early as 2001. By 2015, the state began to suspect that some schools were inflating their participation numbers, so it requested student log-in data. That’s when ECOT started to crumble. The department found that the school couldn’t account for many of its students. The state ultimately sought to recoup $80 million. Earlier this year, the school shut down. While the school racked up headlines, school founder William Lager and other ECOT officials gave more than $2 million in campaign donations, largely to Republicans. AFSCME pulled its numbers from a donation database compiled by Innovation Ohio, a liberal group, which used data compiled by Follow the Money. In 2015, DeWine received $12,532 from Lager. DeWine later gave the contribution to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Columbus, so AFSCME didn’t count that amount in the total. But AFSCME did include about $3,000 in donations from ECOT lobbyists, board members and an attorney since 2010. Joshua Eck, DeWine’s campaign spokesman, said that those smaller donations include people who worked on behalf of various entities. AFSCME also added in $36,000 from Lager and other ECOT officials to Jon Husted, who is DeWine’s running mate. The donations are largely from 2002 to 2009, when Husted was in the Legislature, before he became the Secretary of State in 2011. Husted joined DeWine’s ticket in December and then turned over his campaign’s $4.6 million to the DeWine-Husted ticket. While AFSCME said that the donations to Husted should be counted in that pot, DeWine’s campaign says those donations are years ago from previous races. While news reports in Ohio have noted that the DeWine-Husted campaign didn’t return the $36,000, it’s impossible to declare whether specific donations in the 2000s were spent or remained years later. ""Regular contributions are not connected or assigned to expenditures, so assigning specific contributions to cash on hand in situations with many donors and many expenditures over multiple reporting periods/cycles can't be done with certainty,"" said Brendan Glavin, data and systems manager for the Campaign Finance Institute. The DeWine campaign notes that Cordray took money from ECOT, too. He received $500 in 2006, when he was running for Ohio treasurer and $100 when he was running for state attorney general. Cordray donated the sum to an educational foundation. Ohio’s AFSCME affiliates have endorsed Cordray. DeWine has defended his actions related to ECOT. ""We have been very aggressive on this and we have moved when we legally could move,"" DeWine said earlier this summer. Dan Tierney, a DeWine office spokesman, said said the role of the attorney general is generally limited to pursuing the recovery of misspent funds by closed schools. The Department of Education is responsible for ensuring schools are following the law, he said. But it is the attorney general’s responsibility to defend the education department. When ECOT sued the education department in July 2016, DeWine hired outside counsel, Doug Cole. In August 2018, the Ohio Supreme Court sided with the education department’s requirement that ECOT show student log-in data. Separately, DeWine pursued another legal avenue. In 2018 when ECOT closed, DeWine sought permission from a court to handle the recovery claims and filed litigation in August to recover money related to ECOT. Tierney has pointed to a court ruling in March related to a separate charter school that upheld the authority for the attorney general to pursue claims related to corrupt practices to recover money. DeWine’s critics have said he didn’t have to wait for that ruling, or action by other officials, to try to establish precedent. DeWine’s lawsuit said that Lager violated the Ohio Corrupt Practices Act by acting as an agent of ECOT while also signing contracts between the school and his companies.   ""This corrupt relationship was there, it has been there his entire term (since 2011),"" said Stephen Dyer, education expert at Innovation Ohio and a former Democratic state legislator. ""Anytime you are the state’s top cop and the largest ripoff of public taxpayer dollars in state history happens under your watch, that’s a problem."" Chad Aldis, the vice president for Ohio policy for the Fordham Institute, a school-choice advocate and charter sponsor, said everything changed after the Department of Education probed the school’s attendance in 2016. ""Anyone can make the claim that folks should have acted sooner,"" Aldis told the Dispatch. ""But I think it’s easy to see that after we’ve had all this litigation and the wrongdoing is laid bare, it’s harder to do that in real time."" An AFSCME ad said DeWine took $40,000 from ECOT and ""did nothing while the online for profit school lied about enrollment and took millions meant for our kids."" DeWine received donations from the school but later donated the bulk of them. The ad puffs up the donations by largely including money donated from ECOT officials to DeWine’s running mate Husted when he was in the Legislature. Husted joined DeWine’s ticket for governor in December and then merged their campaign accounts. It’s an exaggeration to state that DeWine did ""nothing"" -- but he didn’t take legal action until the education department was sued in 2016. He then filed litigation in August in an effort to recoup money. DeWine argues that he had to wait for other actions by the court or state offices to step in, though critics say he could have been more aggressive. The warning signs about ECOT had been documented in news articles for many years, and yet the state government as a whole was slow to act.

Group defending governor candidate Tony Evers in handling of teacher porn case is partially accurate
","After the Wisconsin Republican Party repeatedly attacked Tony Evers with TV ads over his role in a teacher porn case, two groups defended the Democratic candidate for governor with their own TV ads, both released on Aug. 20, 2018. The ad by the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee was partially accurate. But it overstated in describing why Evers, the state schools superintendent, didn’t revoke the teacher’s license and what he did to make a change in state law. We rated the group’s two-part claim as Half True. Now we’re evaluating the other ad, by a group called A Stronger Wisconsin, which is backed by the Democratic Governors Association. This ad also makes a two-part claim and, while partially accurate, it also has some overstatement problems. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. The ad is about the case of Andy Harris, a middle-school science teacher in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison. He was fired in 2010 for viewing images of nudity on his school computer and showing at least one of them to a female co-worker. Harris got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he should have been given a suspension rather than be fired because other employees were given lesser punishments for ""doing the same or similar types of things."" The arbitrator also determined that Harris’ behavior, given that students were not present when he viewed the images, did not endanger any students as defined by state law at the time. The law at the time was crucial in Evers’ decision not to try to revoke Harris’ license after the arbitrator gave Harris his job back. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. The TV spot by A Stronger Wisconsin begins with images and criticism of Republican Gov. Scott Walker, whom Evers will face in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election. Then the narrator says: ""When two judges said it was illegal to fire a teacher for inappropriate conduct, Tony Evers worked with Republicans and Democrats and changed the law."" However, words on the screen went further on that second part, declaring: ""Evers got the law changed."" So, let’s look at both parts of the claim. State GOP: Says Tony Evers ""allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students."" Mostly False. The first part of the claim, as stated by the narrator and shown on the screen, is ""two judges said it was illegal"" to fire the teacher. A footnote on the screen cites one of our fact checks. Two courts did uphold the arbitrator’s decision to overturn the firing. But the ad’s phrasing overstates what the judges found and it isn’t what we said. A circuit court judge, and a three-judge state appeals court panel, upheld the arbitrator's ruling to give Harris his job back  — concluding the arbitrator was within her rights to do so. But they didn’t conclude that firing the teacher was illegal. State GOP: Says Tony Evers ""didn't revoke the license of a teacher caught spreading pornography and commenting on the bodies of middle-school girls."" Half True. The Harris case led to a change in state law so that now, the law explicitly says that if a teacher views pornography at school, even if students aren’t present, the teacher can be fired. The ad, meanwhile, gives mixed messages on the new law. The narrator says Evers ""worked with"" lawmakers and changed the law, but the words on the screen say ""Evers got the law changed."" A group of Republicans introduced the bill and the author of the bill downplayed the role of Evers’ department. But officials in Evers’ department discussed the legislation with the author as the bill was being drafted and testified at hearings in favor of it. So, Evers was involved  — as the narrator says in the ad  — but was not the leading force, as the words on the screen claim. A Stronger Wisconsin says: ""When two judges said it was illegal to fire a teacher"" who viewed pornography at school, ""Tony Evers worked with Republicans and Democrats and changed the law."" Judges ruled that an arbitrator was within her rights to overturn the firing, but they did not conclude that the firing was illegal. Meanwhile, Evers supported the change in state law, but was not the leading force. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D17C40>],/factchecks/2018/sep/12/stronger-wisconsin/group-defending-governor-candidate-tony-evers-hand/

Ron DeSantis leaves out context in claim that Andrew Gillum wants to abolish ICE
","In his quest to become Florida’s next governor, Republican Ron DeSantis has embraced President Donald Trump’s rhetoric against illegal immigration. He’s also labeled his Democratic opponent Andrew Gillum as someone who doesn’t care about enforcing immigration laws. ""He wants to abolish ICE and doesn't believe in doing any type of immigration enforcement,"" DeSantis said of Gillum during a Sept. 2 interview with New York radio host John Catsimatidis. (ICE is the acronym for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency in charge of executing immigration laws within the United States.) Gillum has called for abolishing ICE but has also said that ICE needs to be ""replaced with a more compassionate and focused agency"" focused on immigration issues. DeSantis resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives on Sept. 10 to focus on his campaign. Election Day is Nov. 6. Gillum, Tallahassee’s mayor, is among Democrats who have criticized ICE since media reports said newly arriving immigrant families were being separated at the border. This summer, the Trump administration employed a ""zero-tolerance"" policy to refer for prosecution all immigrants who enter the United States illegally. That resulted in more than 2,000 children being separated from their parents. The government has since reunified most of them due to a court order, but hundreds of children remain without their parents. ""It's time to abolish ICE in its current form to be replaced with a more compassionate and focused agency that actually keeps us safer,"" Gillum posted on Facebook on July 3. ""Donald Trump has turned ICE into a police and child separation agency — not a border enforcement agency that treats people humanely and compassionately."" Gillum’s claim that Trump turned ICE from being a ""border enforcement agency"" is flawed, because ICE doesn’t enforce laws at the border. The agency that does that is U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP. What’s ICE’s role? ICE agents pick up people already living in the United States illegally. A division of ICE also investigates and arrests people involved in gangs and human trafficking. ICE also oversees detention facilities that house people waiting a resolution of their immigration case or waiting to be deported. Some Democrats in Congress calling for the abolition of ICE have muddled the distinction between the two agencies. Republicans have done so, too; claiming that getting rid of ICE equals a call for open borders. Overall, there isn’t a unified Democratic message behind the ""abolish ICE"" movement. For some, it means a restructuring of the agency, a new focus, or shifting responsibilities to other agencies. Others want to see ICE shuttered and a new agency rise in its place. Generally, however, they aren’t calling for end to immigration enforcement. ""We want to replace ICE with the Department of Justice, an entity that has not been tarnished in the same way as ICE has,"" Gillum said during an Aug. 29 CNN interview after winning the Democratic primary. In his July Facebook post, Gillum wrote that ""a decision between security or compassionate immigration policy is a false choice,"" and promised to fight for both as governor. What’s DeSantis’s evidence that Gillum doesn't believe in any type of immigration enforcement? He cites instances when Gillum spoke in favor of immigrants (including ones here illegally) and against measures that he believes would discriminate or criminalize them. But Gillum hasn’t said no laws should be enforced. Gillum is against requiring that Florida employers use what’s now a voluntary program called E-Verify. That program checks a person’s identity and employment eligibility by electronically matching his or her information to federal databases, including immigration records. Gillum has said that requiring E-Verify ""criminalizes people's personhood."" (Some employers with federal contracts are required to enroll in E-Verify.) Gillum also opposes ""mass deportations"" and believes immigration enforcement should remain a federal matter. He criticized Trump for threatening to cut federal funds from cities that limit their cooperation with federal agents. Trump calls those places ""sanctuary cities."" Gillum told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune that as governor he would ""promote mutual trust and cooperation between law enforcement and immigrant communities, regardless of immigration status."" DeSantis said Gillum, ""wants to abolish ICE and doesn't believe in doing any type of immigration enforcement."" Gillum said ""it's time to abolish ICE,"" joining some Democrats making similar calls after reports of family separations at the border.

"['Legal Issues', 'North Carolina', 'Mark Meadows']","
The FBI, the Steele dossier and wiretapping, explained
","The special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election has brought a lot of names to the center of attention. The most recent is Bruce Ohr, a Justice Department official whose relationship with former British spy Christopher Steele has sounded alarms among congressional Republicans. In a matter of weeks, Ohr has transformed from a virtual unknown in politics to a favorite target of President Donald Trump and his allies. Rep. Mark Meadows, a western North Carolina Republican who is one of the president’s staunchest defenders and a leader of the House Freedom Caucus, has criticized Ohr for his connection to Steele, the author of the dossier that made claims about the president’s financial and personal ties to Russia.   On Sept. 5, a week after a closed-door interview between Ohr and the House Oversight Committee, Meadows sent a letter asking the Justice Department to review Ohr’s contacts with Steele. But even before that request, Meadows was floating a theory for his supporters to consider. ""Here are some key facts you need to know about Bruce Ohr to understand why he is important to our investigation,"" Meadows wrote in an email newsletter. ""Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie Ohr, worked for Fusion GPS — which was the firm hired by the Clinton campaign to write the dossier. Bruce Ohr gave the dossier to the FBI. The FBI then used the same dossier to spy on the Trump campaign."" Other Trump allies have also sought to link Ohr, his wife and the dossier to the FBI’s wiretapping of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. During a July 12 congressional hearing with FBI agent Peter Strzok, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, leveled the same charge.   ""So Nellie Ohr works for Fusion, works for (Fusion GPS founder and former journalist) Glenn Simpson, and she's giving documents to Bruce Ohr, who’s giving them to the FBI,"" Jordan said. Details surrounding the dossier, the Page wiretap and the Russia investigation are still emerging. But much has been reported already, and we wondered how Meadows’ statement would stack up against publicly available information. The FBI’s National Press Office declined to comment. Ben Williamson, Meadows’ communications director, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Nellie Ohr ""worked for Fusion GPS ... the firm hired by the Clinton campaign"" Bruce Ohr’s wife, Nellie Ohr, is a 55-year-old former government official and Russia expert. Meadows is correct that during the 2016 election, Nellie Ohr worked for Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm that was hired to work for then-candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign, according to Fox News. But the firm’s research into Trump was already underway when the Clinton campaign got involved — a fact Meadows omitted in his email. Fusion GPS was originally hired by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website. It was only after Trump secured the Republican nomination that Fusion GPS was hired on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee by their law firm, Perkins Coie, to continue compiling research about Trump, according to the New York Times. At that point, the firm hired Steele, who had sources in Russia. Steele produced 35 pages of research memos, which became collectively known as the Steele dossier and detailed some salacious — but not fully verified — claims about Trump. ""Bruce Ohr gave the dossier to the FBI."" While Nellie Ohr was employed by Fusion GPS, Bruce Ohr worked in the Justice Department. Although Meadows’ statement does not specifically allege that Bruce Ohr received the dossier from his wife, other Republicans have insisted that she acted as a go-between for Fusion GPS and law enforcement agencies. But as we noted in a fact-check of conservative pundit Hugh Hewitt about Jordan’s theory, there is no evidence that Nellie Ohr personally routed the dossier to the Justice Department. It is true, however, that Bruce Ohr gave the dossier to the FBI, according to former FBI agent Peter Strzok’s testimony. ""Mr. Ohr provided information to the FBI that included material that is what everybody is calling the dossier, reporting from Mr. Steele,"" Strzok told lawmakers during a congressional hearing. But Bruce Ohr was not the FBI’s only source for the dossier. The FBI received multiple versions of the Steele dossier from several different people, according to an email Strzok sent colleagues in January 2017, which was obtained by The Hill. The late Sen. John McCain said he delivered a version of the dossier to then-FBI director James Comey in late 2016. David Corn, a reporter at Mother Jones, also admitted on Twitter that he provided the Steele memos to the FBI shortly after the election. Even Steele himself met with FBI officials on July 5, 2016, according to the New Yorker. Meadows’ omission of these details could be misleading for readers of his email. ""The FBI then used the same dossier to spy on the Trump campaign."" In October 2016, the FBI applied to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for a warrant to wiretap Page, a former Trump campaign adviser. The agency believed Page was ""collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government"" after being ""the subject of targeted recruitment."" In February 2018, Republicans and Democrats released competing memos about the application for surveillance, with Democrats pushing back on Republicans’ claims that the FBI did not properly secure a warrant and misused its surveillance capabilities, according to the New York Times. But on July 21, 2018, the Trump administration released a heavily redacted version of the documents related to the wiretapping. The documents revealed that the FBI did partly rely on claims first reported in the dossier. For example, the application cited claims from the dossier that Page, while visiting Moscow in the summer of 2016, met with two senior Russian representatives to talk about removing Ukraine-related sanctions the U.S. had imposed on Russia and other matters. The FBI said in the application that it suspected the person who hired Steele was looking to discredit the Trump campaign, but clarified that Steele’s previous reporting of ""reliable information"" as a British intelligence officer made the agency believe segments from the dossier were ""credible."" (The FBI eventually terminated its partnership with Steele in October 2016 after he made what the agency considered to be improper disclosures to the news media.)  But the redacted documents also contained evidence against Page that did not come from the dossier. In fact, Page was on the FBI’s radar as early as 2013 for contacts with Russian intelligence, according to the New York Times.  Meadows’ suggestion that the FBI’s wiretapping amounted to ""spy(ing) on the Trump campaign"" is also misleading, since the FBI secured a warrant from the FISA court to do so. Page also left the Trump campaign in September 2016, before the FBI applied for its warrant. Even some Republicans have objected to claims suggesting the wiretap could be considered spying. ""I don't believe that them looking into Carter Page means they were spying on the campaign,"" said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio during an interview on CNN. It is worth noting that the Steele dossier did not trigger the special counsel’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s Russian connections. That probe began in July 2016 due to information from Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, as PolitiFact has shown before.  Our ruling In an email newsletter, Meadows said Nellie Ohr worked for Fusion GPS, the Clinton campaign funded the Steele dossier, Bruce Ohr handed the dossier to the FBI, and the FBI used the dossier to spy on the Trump campaign. Meadows is correct that Nellie Ohr worked for Fusion GPS and that the Clinton campaign hired the firm to continue researching Trump. He is also right that Bruce Ohr provided the FBI a copy of the dossier. But the FBI received the dossier from multiple sources. And it is not entirely accurate to say the FBI used the dossier to spy on the Trump campaign since Page left the campaign in September 2016. The FBI relied in part on the dossier to secure a warrant to monitor Page, but the dossier was not the sole basis for the wiretap — and the wiretap was authorized in court. New details could emerge if further documents related to the wiretap are disclosed. But based on what we know now, we rate this statement Half True.  This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

"['Oregon', 'Voting Record', 'Bob Tiernan']","
Party Chair Bob Tiernan says Oregon’s Republicans outvoted Democrats on Nov. 2
","
Thursday morning was a rough one for Bob Tiernan. Just before Democrat John Kitzhaber accepted the governorship, the chairman of Oregon’s Republican Party had to bat away suggestions that the state GOP was in need of a major makeover.

Tiernan was a guest on Oregon Public Broadcasting’s Think Out Loud Thursday morning, and host Emily Harris asked him what was next for the party. ""If Chris Dudley had won, there was a lot of talk that he would be the leader of rebuilding the Oregon Republican Party,"" she said. She then went on to mention the fact that all statewide offices belong to Democrats and that Republicans had been having a difficult time finding candidates for some races.

How, Harris asked, would Dudley’s loss affect all that?

""First off, the Republican Party is quite strong in this state. I think you can look at our statistics from this last election,"" Tiernan said. ""We outperformed Democrats. ... Six percent more Republicans across the state voted than Democrats.""

We wondered whether he had that right.

If you take the statement at face value, it sounds as though you had more Republicans than Democrats voting.

Thankfully, the Oregon Secretary of State tracks all these numbers.

As of 8:30 Thursday morning, the Secretary of State was reporting that roughly 644,000 Democrats and 526,000 Republicans voted out of a total of 1,479,188 for all ballots returned. That means Democrats accounted for about 44 percent of returned ballots and Republicans for about 36 percent. That gives the edge to Democrats.

But there’s another way to look at these numbers. While more Democrats than Republicans voted, there are far more Oregon voters registered as Democrats than as Republicans. If you take that into account, the numbers show that 79 percent of all Republicans had turned out to vote while 74.5 of all Democrats had. That is indeed a difference of 6 percent.

We spoke with Greg Leo, the spokesman for the Oregon Republican Party, and he told us that Tiernan was referring to the return rates within each party, not overall.

So, back to the ruling. Tiernan is right, the Republicans did have a stronger turnout if you’re talking party proportions. But he didn’t make it exactly clear what he meant in his guest spot on ""Think Out Loud,"" and certainly listeners could have come away a bit confused, thinking more Republicans had voted than Democrats. So, we’ll split the difference and call this one Half True.

"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Bobby  Scott']","
Bobby Scott said the budget will be ""close to"" balanced in four years if the Bush tax cuts expire on schedule
","
On his way to re-election, Rep. Robert C. ""Bobby"" Scott made no secret that he’d like to see the Bush-era tax cuts expire. All of them.

Distancing himself from Democrat colleagues, Scott, who represents Virginia’s 3rd Congressional District, said the cuts from 2001 and 2003 should not be continued even for those bringing home less than $250,000 a year.

""Extending the Bush tax cuts will add $3.6 trillion to the national debt,"" he wrote in a Richmond Times-Dispatch voter guide. ""If all of the tax cuts expire on schedule, the budget will be close to being balanced in 4 years.""

We were curious about the claim that elimination of the Bush-era tax cuts could mean an almost-balanced budget in just a few years.  

But before looking at whether or not the budget could be balanced in four years, we wanted to make sure the $3.6 trillion figure checked out.

Although estimates vary, yes, that’s pretty close to official 10-year projections of the cost to extend all of the Bush-era tax cuts including adjustments to the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, a substitute income tax levied against some high earners.

In 2001, after the first round of tax cuts, the Bush administration realized that without adjusting the AMT, about 25 percent of the cuts weren’t getting to people. To fix that, they passed a three-year adjustment raising the AMT exemption levels and have extended it every year since.

""Patching the AMT prevents about 20 million more Americans from paying higher taxes,"" said Gerald Prante, a senior economist with the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group.

According to July analysis from the Office of Management and Budget, the cost of extending the tax cuts and continuing to adjust the AMT would be about $3.6 trillion over 10 years.  

An August report by the Congressional Budget Office actually shows a higher figure of $3.9 trillion as the 10-year cost of extending the cuts and patching the  AMT.  The U.S. Department of Treasury in February estimated the cost a little higher than $3.7 trillion.

In case you’re curious, extending tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000 a year accounts for about $679 billion for the 10 years while patching the AMT accounts for about $672 billion, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Tax relief for familes earing $250,000 or less costs about  $2.3 trillion over 10 years.   

So, let’s determine if letting the tax cuts expire and not patching the AMT could balance the budget in four years. -- or at least come close, as Scott says.

To do that, we looked at estimated annual costs of continuing the tax cuts and compared that to projected deficit figures..

According to the OMB report in July, the projected deficit in 2014 is $896 billion. That same year, the additional tax revenue from not extending the tax cuts nor patching the AMT would be $320 billion, reducing the deficit to $576 billion. Not a balanced budget.

In 2015, the story is about the same. The projected deficit that year is $985 billion and the the combined estimated cost of continuing the tax cuts and patching the AMT is $353 billion. So, even if the cuts expire and the AMT is not patched, that would leave a deficit of $632 billion. Again, nowhere near balanced.

""So no, you cannot get rid of the deficit by letting the Bush tax cuts expire anytime within the next 10-year period,"" said Prante. ""For any given year, it’s not anywhere close to the size of the deficit.""

We thought we’d get another perspective just to be sure.

Robert Williams, senior fellow for the Tax Policy Center, pointed to numbers from the CBO’s August budget update, which project that the deficit would fall below 3 percent of Gross Domestic Product by 2014 if the tax cuts expire. Three percent of GDP is a ""sustainable"" deficit level, according to Peter Orszag, former director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.

Williams said, ""One could consider a deficit of that magnitude ‘nearly balanced’ in the sense that debt as a percentage of GDP wouldn't rise if growth resumes its normal rate of more than 3 percent.""

But that seems like quite a stretch to us. So, let’s review.

We must look at the projected annual cost of the tax cuts, if extended, to determine how much could be saved by allowing them to expire. Depending on the source, those estimates when coupled with the AMT adjustment, range between $200 to $500 billion annually over the next 10 years.    

But with budget deficits projected to hover around $1 trillion a year during that time period, the extra tax revenue from allowing the cuts to expire wouldn’t even cut the deficit in half in four years, much less balance the budget.  

So we rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097321340>],/factchecks/2010/nov/05/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-said-budget-will-be-close-balanced-fou/
"['National', 'Economy', 'History', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Tim Kaine']","
Tim Kaine said economy shrank for the first time in '09
","
Editor's note: After we first published this item on Oct. 25, 2010, readers pointed out that our original item considered only current dollar, or nominal, GDP instead of real GDP. We spoke with some experts who agreed that we should have used real GDP. So we have corrected the story and changed the ruling on this item from Mostly True to Barely True. 
Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine appeared on This Week with Christiane Amanpour to defend his party amidst expectations that Republicans will likely make significant gains in the elections set for Nov. 2, 2010.

Amanpour asked Kaine about the terrible economy and about remarks President Barack Obama made that it was important for Democrats to have a sense of humility about what they could accomplish without Republican cooperation.

""What does he mean by humility?"" Amanpour asked. 
""I think it's trying to find the balance between telling a story of accomplishment and change and improvement, while acknowledging that we still have a long way to go,"" Kaine said. ""So when the president came in, as you know, Christiane, the economy of the United States was actually shrinking for the first time in about 70 years. We had come through a decade where we lost jobs, income declined, poverty gaps widened. Now the economy is growing again. ... We've got to keep climbing and not go backward, but you have to have that humility because a lot of people are still suffering, and we've got more work to do."" 
We were interested in fact-checking Kaine's comments that when Obama took office, ""the economy of the United States was actually shrinking for the first time in about 70 years."" Had the downturn been that historic? 
We know from some of our previous fact-checks that experts like to measure the economy by gross domestic product, or GDP, the total market value of goods and services produced within a country's borders over a specific period. The inflation-adjusted GDP growth rate is widely considered a primary indicator of the status of the economy. 
In the United States, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis compiles GDP estimates on both a quarterly and annual basis. The White House and Congress use the bureau's projections to prepare budget estimates, and the Federal Reserve uses it to set monetary policy, according to the bureau. It describes its GDP estimates as ""one of the most closely watched of all economic statistics.""

We looked into statistics on changes in GDP. If it goes up, that means the economy is growing. If it goes down, that means the economy is contracting. We used the GDP as calculated in constant dollars, to rule out the effects of inflation. 
Obama took office at the beginning of 2009. In 2008, the economy showed 0 percent change, and in 2009, it showed a decline of 2.6 percent using inflation-adjusted figures. We started looking back through the years, and we soon found small declines sooner than Kaine said when we adjusted for inflation. In 1991, the economy declined 0.2 percent. In 1982, it declined 1.9 percent and in 1980, 0.3 percent. In 1975 and 1974, there were small declines of 0.2 and 0.6. In 1958, there was a decline of 0.9 percent. There were several years of declines in the 1940s, with the steepest of 10.9 percent in 1946. 
Kaine does better when you consider GDP in nominal dollars -- that is, not adjusted for inflation. According to this metric, in 2008 the economy dropped 1.7 percent compared with the year before. There are no declines until 1949, of 0.7 percent. There was also a small decline in 1946, down 0.4. In 1938, there was a significant decline of 6.3, and then more declines in 1933, 1932, 1931 and 1930. No statistics are available before 1930.

So Kaine is pretty close if you don't adjust for inflation. But when you do, there are several more recent years when there were declines. So we find his statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A40D0C0>],/factchecks/2010/nov/05/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-economy-shrank-first-time/

Washington State Gov. Chris Gregoire says that Washington has consistently ranked in the top five of Forbes' best states for business, ahead of Texas
","
Weeks before he was elected to a third full term in a GOP landslide, Gov. Rick Perry was courting businesses in a bluer state — Washington. The Seattle Times reported Oct. 21 that Perry had sent letters to about 90 ""top employers and a few business associations in Washington"" urging companies worried about taxes in the Evergreen State to relocate.

In Tuesday's elections, Washingtonians rejected a proposal to levy a graduated income tax on the state's wealthiest residents — a 5 percent tax rate on annual taxable earnings exceeding $200,000 for individuals and $400,000 for couples, according to the Times. Individuals earning more than $500,000 and couples earnings more than $1 million would have faced a 9 percent tax rate.

In an Oct. 20 letter to the the president and chief executive officer of Inrix Inc., a tech company based in Kirkland, Washington, Perry wrote: ""As the State of Washington considers a multibillion-dollar tax increase for citizens and businesses... I invite you to consider your future in America's new land of opportunity: the State of Texas.""

And to sweeten the deal: ""If Washington doesn't want your business, Texas does. Texas has no personal income tax and no interest in getting one.""

According to the Times, Gov. Chris Gregoire's office sent the newspaper this response to its query about Perry's invitation: ""We're proud of Inrix and proud they call Washington home. I told them that when I visited their headquarters in May. We're serious about keeping businesses here and attracting new ones to the state. We've consistently ranked in the top five in the Forbes list of best states to do business — ahead of Texas.""

Touché. We couldn't resist checking Gregoire's claim that Washington has consistently beat out Texas on the Forbes list.

In its fifth annual ranking of the best states for business, Forbes named Washington the fifth best state, following Utah, Virginia, North Carolina and Colorado. Texas trudged in seventh.

Forbes says it bases state-by-state rankings on relevant indicators topped by business costs, which take into account labor expenses and the impact of utilities and taxes. Lesser factors include labor supply and the state's regulatory environment and economic climate, its growth prospects and general quality of life, according to the magazine's article on the 2010 rankings.

In 2009, Washington placed second with Texas landing eighth. In 2008, Washington ranked third, Texas ninth.

However, Washington hasn't always trumped Texas. In 2007, Texas ranked fourth and Washington fifth. And in 2006, Texas was No. 2, while Washington was Number 12.

So has Washington consistently come ahead of Texas on the Forbes list? Washington has ranked in the top five states to do business in four of the five years the publication has been in the ranking business. Texas has landed on that list twice, besting Washington both times.

Since 2007 Washington has ""consistently"" ranked in the top five states business-wise, pushing ahead of Texas for three of the past four years.

We rate Gregoire's statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097670580>],/factchecks/2010/nov/05/chris-gregoire/washington-state-gov-chris-gregoire-says-washingto/
"['Oregon', 'Voting Record', 'Democratic Party of Oregon']","
Eighty-five percent of Oregonians voted in 2008
","
This time of year, voting is right up there with picking up litter and adopting kittens as far as civic duties go. In fact, PolitiFact Oregon found this get-out-the-vote reminder distributed to homes on Tuesday, courtesy of the Democratic Party of Oregon.

""VOTE,"" read the flier. ""Your community knows exactly how important it is to vote. In fact, 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008. Thank you for your participation this year.""

At first, PolitiFact Oregon was elated. Who knew Oregon took its ballot duty that seriously? But then, we became suspicious. Isn’t 25 percent of the population here under 18? How could it be then that 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008? So, onward to the fact checking.

First the numbers. There were more than 3.7 million people in Oregon as of July 2007. Obviously, the DPO didn’t mean to claim that babies cast ballots, so let’s whittle the number down to just eligible voters -- 2.8 million is what the secretary of state’s office estimated.

Precisely 1,845,251 people cast ballots in the fall 2008 election. Multiply 2.8 million by 85 percent (0.85) and you get nearly 2.4 million people -- which is way more than the 1.8 million who actually voted.

So what gives?

Well, it turns out that 85 percent of registered voters cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election. Not everyone who is eligible to vote actually registered to vote. In fact, according to the Secretary of State’s website, only 77 percent of eligible adults registered and of that figure, 85 percent cast ballots. Which brings the overall figure to 66 percent. That’s pretty good -- but not 85 percent good.

To be fair, Oregon has long used this calculation to measure electoral participation of registered voters, which Oregon elections officials refer to as ""turnout,"" but no one with a straight face extrapolates that to say that means ""85 percent of Oregonians voted.""

Also, not everyone measures turnout the same way. The United States Elections Project, for example, run by an associate professor atGeorge Mason University, uses as its base eligible voters to measure turnout, not registered voters.

According to the elections project, 68.1 percent of eligible Oregonians voted in 2008. That’s on the high end, and it’s higher than the 62.2 percent cited nationally. Minnesota, apparently, can claim the title of most vote-happy state, with turnout at 78 percent two years ago; on the other hand, Hawaii, at 50.8 percent, just wasn’t into it.

Oregon did have a fairly high voter participation rate in 2008. If the flier had said that Oregon’s turnout in 2008 was 85 percent, or that 85 percent of voters cast a ballot that year, we wouldn’t have a problem with the claim.

But to say that 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008 is just plain inaccurate.

We rate the claim False.

"['Georgia', 'Elections', 'Barry Garner']","
Fulton elections chief pledged quick tallies
","
You might say that a politician didn't make this election season's boldest promise. The head of Fulton County's Department of Registration and Elections did.  

In an article Tuesday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Barry Garner vowed his office would report its results at a decent hour. 
""By 11:30 p.m., we'll be finished, "" Garner said. ""That's my pledge."" 
We gasped. Fulton? Finishing early? Did he remember the 2008 elections?

This is AJC PolitiFact Georgia's 100th take on the truth. The trusty Truth-O-Meter debuted in June, just as the state's primary battles began to heat up. Therefore there are few more fitting ways to celebrate this milestone than by fact-checking results from our first election season.

So let's review Fulton's problems in 2008.

Back then, another elections director was in charge. Absentee ballot processing went so slowly that Fulton County had to hire FedEx to ship nearly 4,000 ballots to voters overnight. FedEx billed the county more than $300,000.

Poll workers counted absentee ballots for 53 hours after closing. State election rules require they stay on site until the count is finished, but crews were so exhausted they were sent home. 
The Georgia Secretary of State's Office blamed poor staffing and procedures.

Because Fulton's count lagged, the U.S. Senate race took an odd turn. Democratic challenger Jim Martin and Republican incumbent Saxby Chambliss continued to campaign after the general election even though it was unclear whether they would compete in a runoff.

They did go to a runoff, which Chambliss won. 

Fulton hired Garner the next year, after a half-dozen other candidates either rejected the job or didn't work out for other reasons.

Garner, who came from Florida's Miami-Dade County, promised major changes.

""We are not going to be the laughingstock of the election community anymore, "" Garner said. ""I guarantee you that. We will turn this thing round.""

Still, even before Tuesday, Fulton ran into trouble. Garner's office sent absentee ballots with incorrect precinct information to more than 200 voters.

That's why his confidence piqued our curiosity. Could Fulton really make its self-imposed 11:30 p.m. deadline? Was Garner capable of a turnaround? 

We called Garner the day after the election.

He clarified that he promised if the polls closed as scheduled at 7 p.m., his office would post results online by 11:30 p.m. He didn't tell poll managers about the goal. 

On Tuesday, 329 of the county's 333 precincts had sent their results to the Election Department's servers by Garner's deadline. That's 98.7 percent.

It takes five or 10 minutes to transfer them to the Web, so numbers from slower precincts likely came online between 11:35 and 11:40 p.m.

""With a few tweaks, we can meet our goal,"" he said.

The four precincts that didn't make it experienced unusually high turnout. They remained open until the last voter in line by 7 p.m. finished. That happened at 9 p.m.

Once voting is done, poll workers must complete state-mandated procedures before sending their results.

There were no voting machine problems, Garner said. The county began transmitting its full election night tally to the Secretary of State's Office by about 1:30 a.m.

They arrived by about 2 a.m., Secretary of State spokesman Matt Carrothers confirmed. There were no problems with transmission, tabulation or other issues.

""This was pretty much in line with ... larger-population counties,"" Carrothers said.

Fulton has made other improvements since 2008. The absentee ballots that caused so many problems were almost all done Tuesday night, Garner said. Those that weren't took extra time because they were twice as long.

""Still, we should have been finished,"" Garner said.

The election isn't officially over, of course. Military and overseas absentee ballots aren't due until the close of business Friday.

And Garner is already thinking about the future. He hopes to meet his goal in 2012.

""If we can do it in Florida, we can do it in Georgia,"" Garner said.

We hope so. It can't get worse than Florida, home of the hanging chad.

Overall, we found that Fulton County did well.

The only precincts that missed the 11:30 p.m. cutoff kept their doors open late because of high turnout. Garner's promise was that he'd be finished by then if polls closed as scheduled, so it's fair to say he met his goal.  

Since workers counted almost all absentee ballots Tuesday night, results from precincts that closed on schedule arrived on time. Tallies appeared on the Web within minutes of deadline, and the department came extremely close to meeting Garner's high expectations.

That makes Garner's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979DD380>],/factchecks/2010/nov/05/barry-garner/fulton-elections-chief-pledged-quick-tallies/

Rep. Michele Bachmann claims Obama's trip to India will cost the taxpayers $200 million a day

It sure sounds outrageous. On his upcoming presidential trip to India, President Barack Obama is bringing an entourage of 3,000, staying in swanky hotels, guarded by an armada of Navy ships -- costing American taxpayers the staggering sum of $200 million a day.

To say this figure -- $200 million a day -- has made the rounds in the blogosphere would be a huge understatement. It has been repeated by nearly every conservative pundit in the land: Hannity, Limbaugh, Beck, Drudge. Always with a healthy dose of indignation.

It also got picked up by U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., who told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Nov. 3, 2010, it was just the latest example of government excess and spending from the Obama administration.

""The president of the United States will be taking a trip over to India that is expected to cost the taxpayers $200 million a day,"" Bachmann said. ""He's taking 2,000 people with him. 
He will be renting out over 870 rooms in India. And these are five-star hotel rooms at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. This is the kind of over-the-top spending. It's a very small example, Anderson.

""And I think this is an example of the massive overspending that we have seen, not only just in the last two years, really in the last four. That's what we saw at the ballot box last evening.""

Again, $200 million a day sounds outrageous. But is it true?

The White House says, emphatically, that it's not.

""Due to security concerns, we are unable to outline details associated with security procedures and costs, but it’s safe to say these numbers are wildly inflated,"" said White House spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield.

Cooper asked Bachmann how she came up with the number.

""These are the numbers that have been coming out in the press,"" Bachmann said.

Actually it's a figure that came from just one source, a news agency in India, relying on an anonymous source. It was then repeated thousands more times in the blogosphere and over conservative airwaves.

The claim that the U.S. would be spending ""a whopping $200 million per day"" on Obama's visit to Mumbai, India, originated in a report from the news agency Press Trust of India. It was an estimate attributed anonymously to ""a top official of the Maharashtra Government privy to the arrangements for the high-profile visit."" Maharashtra is a state located in western India.

Here's what the story said:

""The huge amount of around $200 million would be spent on security, stay and other aspects of the Presidential visit,"" a top official of the Maharashtra Government privy to the arrangements for the high-profile visit said.

About 3,000 people including Secret Service agents, U.S. government officials and journalists would accompany the President. Several officials from the White House and U.S. security agencies are already here for the past one week with helicopters, a ship and high-end security instruments.

Said Bedingfield: ""The numbers reported in this article have no basis in reality.""

Now it's true that overseas travel by presidents can be expensive, said Kelley Gannon, who worked on the press advance team for George H. W. Bush and was director of press advance for George W. Bush. ""You have to re-create a mini White House.""

But pegging an exact cost has long been an elusive task for news reporters.
 
In an Oct. 7, 2009, story for McClatchy Newspapers, reporter Steven Thomma took a stab:

The costs of the trips -- borne by taxpayers -- are difficult to measure, but they're expensive. When (the president) uses the familiar blue-and-white reconfigured 747 as Air Force One, it costs $100,219 an hour to operate, according to the Air Force. And that's just HIS plane.

There also are cargo planes, used to fly in armored limousines, helicopters, staff and other equipment, as well as the Secret Service. A single Air Force C-17 cargo jet, for example, costs $6,960 an hour, according to the Congressional Research Service.

A total of 77 other aircraft were used on one multi-country trip to Asia by former President Bill Clinton in 2000, according to the Air Force Times, including 14 C-17 Globemasters, 12 C-5 Galaxys, three C-141 Starlifters and two C-130 Hercules. ABC News at the time estimated the cost of that entire trip at $50 million.

An Air Force Times story on March 27, 2000, said Clinton's trip to India and Pakistan ""may be the most expensive such mission ever carried out by the Air Force."" The reporters said the operation required hundreds of aircraft missions. They tagged the cost of the 5-day trip at $50 million as well. That comes to $10 million per day.

Previous trips by the Clinton administration were less expensive, according to a September 1999 U.S. Government Accountability Office analysis of the costs for Clinton's 1998 trips to Africa, Chile and China.

""Presidential travel to foreign destinations requires planning, coordination, and logistical and personnel support,"" the report stated. ""The estimated incremental costs of President Clinton’s trips to Africa, Chile, and China were at least $42.8 million, $10.5 million, and $18.8 million, respectively. The largest of these costs consisted of operating expenses of the president’s aircraft and other military passenger and cargo aircraft; travel expenses, including lodging for the travelers; and telecommunications, vehicle, and other equipment rentals and procurement in the countries visited.""

We couldn't find any significant evidence that Obama's 3-day trip to India was going to be unusual in scope.

According to Press Trust of India and the Times of India, two US Air Force Jumbos and four helicopters landed ahead of the president's visit; and Obama will be protected by a fleet of 34 warships, including an aircraft carrier.

In addition, the Times story states:

Obama is expected to fly by a helicopter -- Marine One -- from the city airport to the Indian Navy's helibase INS Shikra at Colaba in south Mumbai.

From there, he will drive down in a Lincoln Continental -- the Presidential limousine -- to the nearby the Taj Hotel.

Two jets, armed with advanced communication and security systems, and a fleet of over 40 cars will be part of Obama's convoy.

Around 800 rooms have been booked for the President and his entourage in Taj Hotel and Hyatt.

The President will have a security ring of American elite Secret Service, which are tasked to guard the President, along with National Security Guards (NSG) and personnel from central paramilitary forces and local police in Mumbai and Delhi.

Similar arrangements will be in place in Delhi, with the Air Force One to be kept in all readiness throughout Obama's stay here from Sunday afternoon to Tuesday morning. 

That probably sounds like a lot, but it's pretty standard fare for presidential travel, several people familiar with such travel told us.

James Gerstenzang, a former reporter who covered numerous foreign trips by presidents for the Los Angeles Times, laughed at the $200 million a day figure, which he guessed was probably ""inflated by a factor of 10."" And the claim about the entourage of 3,000 also seems grossly inflated, he said. He noted that any members of the press traveling with the president pay their own way, so that's not a cost borne by taxpayers.

""It really bothers me when numbers like that get thrown around by both sides for political reasons, without it being backed up,"" Gerstenzang said.

Veteran reporter David Jackson, who has traveled on a number of foreign trips by presidents, wrote for the USA Today, ""No, President Obama's trip is not going to cost $200 million a day.""

""That figure -- first thrown out by a single Indian media outlet and now viral on conservative talk radio -- is wildly, wildly off the mark.""

And basing the claim on an estimate from an anonymous state government official in India is dubious at best.

""I think you have to ask, 'How would they know how much any of this costs?'"" said Gannon, the advance press director under George W. Bush ""We don't share that with officials from foreign governments. I'd question where they got that number from. That does sound very inflated.""

As fact-checkers, we wish we had hard numbers from public documents to settle the issue of the cost of Obama's trip to India. But they don't exist. White House officials say details about foreign travel -- including the cost -- are not released for security reasons. So we don't know the cost to taxpayers of Obama's trip.

But we think Bachmann and others have a responsibility to back up statistics they cite. And in this case, the backing appears to be one news story, relying on an anonymous state government official in India. People familiar with presidential travel say that estimate is way off, and they question how a government official in India would know anyway. And a report by the independent GAO backs that up: A trip to India by Clinton, regarded at the time as perhaps the most expensive in history, was estimated to cost $50 million, or $10 million per day. That alone should cause someone to question the $200 million a day figure. In short, we don't see any evidence to back up this statistic. And we rate Bachmann's claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BED480>],/factchecks/2010/nov/04/michele-bachmann/rep-michele-bachmann-claims-obamas-trip-india-will/
"['Health Care', 'Virginia', 'Scott Rigell']","
Scott Rigell says Glenn Nye voted against bill that would have defunded $5 billion-$10 billion the IRS needed to implement health care legislation
","
The fact that Rep. Glenn Nye voted against President Obama’s health care overhaul isn’t enough for Virginia Beach businessman Scott Rigell, Nye’s Republican challenger for Virginia’s 2nd District seat.

In a release on Rigell’s website critiquing Nye’s performance following a debate, Rigell calls into question one of the Democratic Congressman’s votes related to health care.

The release says that ""on June 24, 2010, Congressman Nye voted against a bill which would have defunded the $5-10 billion required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to implement and enforce the health care legislation, including thousands of new IRS agents and employees.""

The legislation requires all Americans to carry health insurance. IRS agents will enforce that mandate.

We were intrigued by Rigell’s claim and took a a closer look.

Asked to support the statement, Rigell’s camp pointed to a procedural vote on a rule held during consideration of HR 5175, the Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections Act.

What does the Disclose Act have to do with Health Care? Not much.  

But among the political maneuvers that day was a last-ditch effort by Republicans to create legislation that would have blocked funding for the IRS to expand its staff to oversee the health care legislation.

The vote Rigell cites arose from a request by Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, that House members defeat a motion to consider The Disclose Act. That would have given Republicans a chance to introduce H.R. 5570, a bill that would have blocked IRS funding to enforce the health care law.  

What Nye and all but eight fellow Democrats actually voted forwas to proceed with the scheduled agenda rather than allowing Republicans to hijack the floor during a rules vote.

""By voting against it, the Democrats would essentially lose control of the floor to the Republicans to vote on what they want. It’s a gotcha sort of vote,"" explained Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense.

Even if the Democrats had lost the floor, Ellis noted, the was no guarantee the minority Republicans could muster enough votes to introduce and pass legislation that would have eliminated money for the IRS.    

""That’s a real stretch,"" said Ellis. ""This is incredibly convoluted and who knows what the vote would’ve been if the Republicans had taken control. They totally would have been like the dog who caught the car.""

The  $5 billion-$10 billion figure came from a Dec. 19, 2009 Congressional Budget Office analysis of the Senate version of the health care bill, which became the basis for the bill that was passed by both chambers and signed into law. The analysis said the IRS ""would probably"" incur those total costs over 10 years.

So, let’s take a look back at the specifics.

Rigell says that Nye voted against a bill that would blocked funding for the expansion of the IRS to implement and enforce health care legislation.

First, is it correct to say that Nye voted ""against a bill""? No. To start with, the issue in question was a procedural vote on a motion to proceed on legislation unrelated to health care, not a vote against a bill. That said, there’s a tiny fraction of truth in the suggestion that Nye’s vote closed the the door on a bill that might have eliminated funding for a portion of health care reform.  

But, Nye didn’t vote ""against"" anything. He voted for House consideration to proceed on the Disclose Act.

It is far-fetched to make such a sweeping conclusion based on a procedural vote. For that reason, we find the claim to be False.

Mike Prendergast mailer says Kathy Castor voted for $2.6 million to teach prostitutes in China to drink responsibly
","
As attack ads go, the claim in a last-minute mailer (and accompanying radio ad) in a Florida congressional race is certainly an attention-grabber.

It features a picture of two martinis behind the text: ""Congresswoman Kathy Castor voted to spend $2.6 million to teach prostitutes in China to drink responsibly.""

The ad from Florida Republican Mike Prendergast also states on the front, ""The more of our taxpayer dollars Castor and Pelosi waste on outrageous spending, the more jobs we lose in Tampa Bay-St. Petersburg."" On the back, the ad lists ""Examples of Kathy Castor's Spending Votes"" and lists a bunch of outrageous-sounding programs. The source is listed as H.R. 1. That's the Democrats' economic stimulus package -- approved in March 2009.

The list includes some projects that have frequently been cited by Republicans as prime examples of wasteful stimulus spending. For example, the mailer says Castor voted to spend ""$2 million to capture and study exotic ants. "" In Oregon, Republican Senate hopeful Jim Huffman claimed Democratic incumbent Sen. Ron Wyden voted to fund said study of exotic ants. Our partners at PolitiFact Oregon checked it out and found that Wyden’s vote for the stimulus did eventually lead to the funding of a study of exotic ants, but he never voted specifically for the project. He voted, through the stimulus, to direct more money to the National Science Foundation, which then distributed the funds as it saw fit. We rated Huffman's claim False.

But the Prendergast claim that the stimulus included $2.6 million to teach prostitutes in China to drink responsibly was a new one to us.

The Prendergast campaign directed us to a story about the project in CNSNews.com (The Right News. Right Now). The story ran under the headline, ""U.S. Will Pay $2.6 Million to Train Chinese Prostitutes to Drink Responsibly on the Job,"" but that's a summary contested by the agency that awarded the grant.

The 5-year, $2.6 million grant awarded by the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health to Wayne State University in Detroit will allow Dr. Xiaoming Li, professor and director of the university's Prevention Research Center, to ""establish and evaluate whether an alcohol and HIV intervention center can assist in reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS among sex workers in China,"" according to a university press release announcing the grant.

According to the release, ""The findings could have ramifications for at-risk populations throughout the world.""

The research will take place specifically in Guangxi, China, where the sex trade is prevalent and the rate of HIV is ranked third among the country's provinces, the release states.

A spokesman for the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health told us the ad distorted the aim of the project.

The grant ""was not awarded for that purpose,"" John Bowersox told us via e-mail. ""Rather, the researchers will use the grant to develop, implement, and evaluate an alcohol use and HIV risk reduction intervention program among female sex workers in China. This is in line with previous studies showing that social norms and institutional policy in commercial sex venues greatly influence alcohol use and sexual behavior among the sex workers in those venues. Studies such as these are needed to translate and adapt interventions that have proven to be effective in the U.S. to other settings and to learn from other conditions and cultures to inform our understanding of the causes, consequences, and differences in HIV-related risks, morbidity, and mortality in diverse populations. Preventing HIV infection is NIH’s highest priority for HIV-related research. We need to explore a range of research avenues in vulnerable populations around the world to learn the best ways to control the transmission of HIV.""

Bowersox noted that the grant went through the NIH's two-tier review process, ""which includes a scientific and technical review as well as consideration by an Advisory Council that includes public representatives. The Council makes recommendations based on alignment of the grant application with the research priorities of the NIH.""

In an interview with CNSNews.com, Li said, ""The purpose of the project is to try and develop an intervention program targeting HIV risk and alcohol use. So basically, it’s an alcohol and HIV risk reduction intervention project.""

""We want to get some understanding of the fundamental role of alcohol use and HIV risk,"" Li told CNSNews.com. ""We use the population in China as our targeted population to look at the basic issues. I think the findings will benefit the American people, too.""

The CNSNews story ran on May 11, 2009. That was about the time that a lot of Republican members of Congress were putting out lists of stimulus projects they said were wasteful or unrelated to job creation. But, as the CNSNews.com story noted, the grant for the project was awarded in November 2008. That's pre-stimulus. It's also pre-Obama administration.

So which vote actually led to the funding for the grant? That's a tricky question. Again, the grant was awarded in November 2008. That's part of the 2009 fiscal year (which began in October 2008). But the omnibus appropriations bill for 2009 wasn't approved until March of 2009. Castor voted for it. Castor also voted for the Fiscal Year 2008 consolidated appropriations bill, (H.R. 2764) in June 2007. But it is arguably another vote, a ""continuing resolution"" to continue funding programs at the same levels of the 2008 budget until an appropriations bill passed, that funded the grant. The resolution passed easily -- with scores of Republicans and most Democrats voting for it -- as a vote against would have meant a vote to cut off disaster and war funding. Castor voted for that, too (H.R. 2638) in June 2007.

Again, these are all massive spending bills. It was one of those spending bills that actually funded the grant in question in Prendergast's mailer (contrary to the ad's claim that it was part of the stimulus).

By e-mail, Robert J. Winsler, press secretary for the Prendergast campaign, told us that it didn't matter whether it was part of the stimulus.

""While several reputable news sources reported the funds as part of stimulus, all reports have proven taxpayers funded the over two-and-a-half million dollar study, and none investigated how the money for the five-year grant was actually appropriated -- be it the stimulus bill or the 2009 budget for the NIH, both of which Rep. Castor voted in favor,"" Winsler said.

It was ""irrelevant"" how many Republicans may have also supported the spending bills, because ""Mike is a free-thinking candidate,"" Winsler said.

""Let's not digress too far: the study existed, and one way or another the Congresswoman approved taxpayer money for it,"" Winsler said. ""The real story here isn't the tiny print on the bottom of one of our mailers but rather why a representative who has let the unemployment rate rise so atrociously under her time in office is sending money overseas to study an illegal practice instead of working for the people she represents.""

But Steve Ellis of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense called the ad's claim ""an enormous stretch.""

Congress voted to allocate funding to the National Institutes for Health, to spend according to its discretion. The NIH, in turn, appropriated money to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, which then decided to fund the grant in question. It wasn't an earmark, Ellis said. And, he noted the grant was awarded during the Bush (Republican) administration.

""They are trying to make it seem like she voted on a bill about spending the money on that program, and in reality, that's not the case,"" Ellis said.

One could argue that part of the problem with Congress is that legislators sign off on spending bills without knowing how every dollar will be spent. But, said Ellis, that's ""too much information for anyone to maintain,"" and so spending is left to the discretion of various government departments.

""They are trying to draw a direct line,"" Ellis said. ""But it's a vote at 10,000 feet, and the decision was made on the ground.""

We have two problems with the ad's claim. No. 1, the ad distorts the purpose of the grant. More importantly, though, it was a grant awarded by the National Institutes for Health based on its own internal review process and was determined to be within the institute's mission and priorities. Castor voted to allocate money to the National Institutes for Health, but she had nothing to do with selecting the grant, and there was no mention of the grant in the bill she voted on. And it wasn't -- as the fine print of the mailer suggests -- even part of the economic stimulus. In fact, it was a grant awarded by a department of a Republican administration. We rate the ad's claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C031C0>],/factchecks/2010/nov/01/mike-prendergast/mike-prengergast-mailer-says-kathy-castor-voted-sp/
"['Ohio', 'Negative Campaigning', 'Trade', 'John Boccieri']","
Rep. John Boccieri portrays challenger Jim Renacci as a menacing trade lobbyist
","
Most days, congressional candidates can’t get donations from lobbyists quickly enough. They’ll even take them from lobbyists who handle a sub-specialty: foreign trade matters.

And there’s nothing improper, illegal or fattening about that, because all sides in the nation’s trade battles -- from manufacturers who want cheap raw materials to the United Steelworkers of America, which wants to protect American foundry jobs – hire Washington lobbyists to look out for their interests.

So what is up, you might ask, with this criticism of an opponent by John Boccieri, a Democratic incumbent in Ohio’s 16th Congressional District? He accuses Republican challenger Jim Renacci of registering ""as a foreign trade lobbyist,"" as if that were disgraceful.

Boccieri launched a cable television ad with that charge in early October. Then on Oct. 18 during a debate with Renacci in Canton, Boccieri repeated it. It’s a fact verifiable from public records,  the first-term incumbent said in answer to a question about the tone of ads, ""that Mr. Renacci was registered as a foreign trade lobbyist in the United States government.""

To back up this claim, Boccieri’s campaign pointed to a lobbying registration form filed in May, 2008, with the clerk of the U.S. Senate, where all lobbying registrations are kept. The form was filed by a fledgling consulting firm called Smokerise International Group, formed by three people, including Renacci, a Wadworth businessman. Named for Smokerise Drive, the street on which Renacci and other partners had offices, the firm also filed business registration papers with the Ohio Secretary of State’s office the same month, public records show.

The name sounded worldly, but there was nothing else international about it – and certainly not its clients. It had none.

The firm never filed a single piece of paper saying it represented anyone, as would be required if it had actual clients.

Renacci’s campaign spokesman, James Slepian, says two business associates wanted to form the firm and Renacci agreed to help because of his background as a CPA. The firm ""never got off the ground,"" Slepian said in an e-mail to us, ""but as a precautionary measure, one of the partners registered all three of them as lobbyists, just in case they ever took on any lobbying clients.""

The registration, filed by Laura Mills, an attorney who was listed as vice chairman and owner, included areas of federal policy in which the firm might lobby. They listed nine areas, including defense, aerospace, the budget,small business matters and trade

Note that they didn’t say ""foreign"" trade, which would be redundant because trade is understood to involve the movement of goods or services between two countries.

That’s it. They never filed another piece of paper because they never lobbied.

You expected a smoking gun?

So did we, because calling someone a ""foreign trade lobbyist"" sounds dastardly. Of the nine potential lobbying areas listed in the Smokerise filing, Boccieri singled out only ""trade"" for criticism. We agree that might have been a smart tactic on his part, because saying that his opponent ""registered as a small business lobbyist"" would lack zing.

This, then, is the extent of the evidence on which the Boccieri campaign makes its claim.

It is Boccieri’s right to cast aspersions on trade lobbyists. But we were curious about his negative feelings, because Boccieri, like many candidates,  has accepted campaign donations from lobbyists, according to our review of data from CQ Money Line and the Center for Responsive Politics, which are services that track fund-raising. We looked up some of these donor-lobbyists’ filings in the Senate and found that some have lobbied on trade matters.

Or to use Boccieri’s own words: Boccieri even takes money from ""foreign trade lobbyists.""

Not that there’s anything wrong with that.

So yes, Renacci is registered as a lobbyist, and his fledgling firm said on its registration form that it intended to lobby on trade. But it ended up not lobbying at all, and had that not been the case, it also might have lobbied on all manner of benign-sounding matters, not a one of which Boccieri singled as horrific.

Boccieri’s ""foreign trade lobbyist"" claim is not false because it contains elements of truth. But it leaves out context and detail, intentionally creating a menacing picture of Renacci’s activities.

The claim’s accuracy is overshadowed by those details, and so the Truth-O-Meter considers it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B241C0>],/factchecks/2010/nov/01/john-boccieri/rep-john-boccieri-portrays-challenger-jim-renacci-/
"['Abortion', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Wisconsin', 'Tom Barrett']","
Tom Barrett says Scott Walker wants to ban the pill and other forms of birth control
","
Democrat Tom Barrett is using the last days of the Wisconsin governor’s race to paint Republican rival Scott Walker as a radical conservative, with abortion and women’s reproductive rights the centerpiece of his argument.

Barrett first criticized Walker’s no-exceptions stance against legal abortions, a statement we rated True. In a new TV ad, Barrett repeats that claim and then adds this one: 
""It turns out there's a lot we didn't know about Scott Walker,"" a narrator says as an image of a birth-control pill case dominates the screen. ""Scott Walker wants to ban common forms of birth control, including the pill."" 
We rated as Barely True a claim by Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin that Walker ""tried to pass a law to allow pharmacists to block women's access to birth control."" That claim centered on a bill that would let pharmacists refuse to dispense contraceptives on moral grounds. 
Barrett’s new claim goes much further.

An outright ban on birth control?

As evidence, the Barrett campaign points to an endorsement Walker received by the group Pro-Life Wisconsin (running mate Rebecca Kleefisch was endorsed, too) and a questionnaire he filled out before receiving it.

There was little surprise when Walker won the endorsement of Wisconsin Right to Life, the state’s largest anti-abortion group. But the smaller, more staunchly conservative Pro-Life Wisconsin says it has not endorsed a gubernatorial candidate for years.

It insists that candidates, to get the endorsement, perfectly line up with its views as expressed on a survey.

Walker campaign spokeswoman Jill Bader said the survey, which Walker scored 100 percent on, does not include any birth control questions. That’s not quite true. It includes one that asks the pharmacist question and one that asks if candidates would block minors from receiving taxpayer-funded contraceptives. Walker answered yes to both.

Barrett’s campaign, though, points to the first question on the survey:

""Would you sign legislation that declares that a preborn child has an inalienable right to life from the moment of fertilization forward?""

Some background:

The question refers to ""personhood"" rights, a growing national movement in some pro-life circles to use state laws or state constitutions to bestow full citizenship rights and protections to the unborn.

Pro-Life Wisconsin and related groups in other states oppose all forms of artificial birth control, They hope that ""personhood"" rights will bring a ban on all abortions -- and a ban on the pill, the group’s legislative director Matt Sande told PolitiFact Wisconsin.

Other anti-abortion groups have focused on a more direct route: The U.S. Supreme Court, which in 1973 held that a woman's decision to have an abortion is a private choice that is protected by the U.S. Constitution. That Roe vs. Wade decision still defines the issue.

Pro-Life Wisconsin’s definition of pregnancy as starting at fertilization differs from the worldwide mainstream view that it begins when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus, said Raj Narayan, Medical College of Wisconsin physician and associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology.

Birth control pills work, when used properly, by preventing ovulation, not by preventing implantation of a fertilized egg, he said. In theory, birth control pills could prevent implantation, but it is unprovable scientifically, Narayan said.

In the view of Pro-Life Wisconsin, there are cases -- even if a very small percentage -- where a fertilized egg (already a full citizen, under the theoretical legislation) is prevented by the pill from attaching to the womb. That, they say, constitutes an abortion.

In contrast, Wisconsin Right to Life views the idea that the pill causes abortions as ""speculation,"" according to executive director Barbara Lyons.

The view is disputed, too, by the mainstream medical community, as Narayan noted.

What’s important for our evaluation, though, is the political realm.

Did Walker know about -- and agree with -- the group’s views on birth control as causing abortion?

For the 2010 election, candidates were given survey instructions and a memo entitled ""Hormonal Birth Control and its Abortion Causing Effect,"" according to Sande. That memo clearly lays out the group’s view that ""any artificial action that works to destroy a human embryo is abortifacient in nature."" It lumps ""most if not all birth control drugs and devices"" into that category.

Sande downplays the chances Pro-Life Wisconsin will succeed in its anti birth-control agenda because it believes society is not ready for it. But a birth control ban is the group’s aim. Its mechanism to get there is ""personhood"" legislation -- Question 1 on the candidate survey.

Since 2006, the group has been laying the groundwork for its proposed constitutional amendment. Elsewhere, such efforts are further along. Colorado voters will consider a ""personhood"" amendment in the Nov. 2, 2010 election.

We wanted to ask Walker to clarify his view on the topic. The campaign did not make him available. In an e-mail, Bader said: ""Scott is pro-life. He believes that government has no role in whether adults choose to use birth control or not. This was Scott’s view of that question on the survey.""

She noted -- as do we -- no direct question on a birth control ban was asked.

Barrett’s side countered that the implications of the question were made clear. Said spokesman Phil Walzak: ""They want to currry favor and get that 100% rating, but when they are called on it they hedge.""

Where does the group asking the survey question come down?

Sande, of Pro-Life Wisconsin, agreed Walker signed onto the concept based on his answer, but said he thought it would be unfair to draw the conclusion Walker supports a particular ""personhood"" initiative. After all, no proposed language was given. And the birth-control ban is not part of the group’s immediate legislative agenda.

Now it’s our turn.

The Barrett campaign makes a strong claim against Walker, saying he supports a ban on commonly used contraceptives. It bases its statement on a survey by Pro-Life Wisconsin that did not ask that question directly. Rather, Barrett -- and the group -- say it is embedded in a question about a potential legislation on ""personhood,"" that is giving full human rights at the moment of fertilization.

In viewing the pill as abortion, not just birth control, there is no question the group is out of step with medicine -- and the larger group, Wisconsin Right to Life. Barrett argues by supporting the question in the survey, a candidate signs on to this view as well. Walker’s campaign disputes this. Walker did, however, did get the group’s memo which clearly outlined its views and goals. Did he read it? He should have if he is answering the group’s questions.  

Ultimately, we don’t know -- and neither does the Barrett campaign, which leaves out important details in its hard-line statement. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B0BB80>],/factchecks/2010/nov/01/tom-barrett/tom-barrett-says-scott-walker-wants-ban-pill-and-o/

For four years, Republican congressional candidates have attacked Democrats on a vote that combines two emotional issues -- Social Security and illegal immigration -- into one fat target.

In the 2010 U.S. Senate race, Republican Ron Johnson continues the tradition, pointing to an obscure 2006 Senate vote to level the charge that Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold supported giving Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants.

Johnson has pounded away at the issue in a radio ad, automated phone calls and on his website. In the Oct. 11, 2010 debate, Feingold answered Johnson’s charge flatly: ""Well, of course I don’t support Social Security benefits for undocumented people. That’s just absolutely false.""

Now, Johnson is denying Feingold’s denial, charging in a news release the three-term senator is lying about his own record.

Got all that?

Let’s put this one to the test -- and to rest.

The vote in question is on an amendment to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006. The immigration reform bill -- which had Feingold’s support but never passed -- was designed to give most illegal immigrants a chance to become legal citizens.

Feingold has said in campaign literature he backs requiring illegal workers to ""come forward, pay hefty fines, pay taxes, learn English and civics, work, and wait in the back of the line – before earning the privilege of permanent resident status.""

Johnson has emphasized border security first and deporting criminals who are here illegally. He criticizes ""blanket"" amnesty but has backed ""humane"" treatment of hard-working illegals and some unspecified process involving employer penalties.

At the time of the 2006 immigration reform debate, by longstanding practice, U.S. law broadly allowed immigrants who later get legal status to get credit for Social Security payments made while they were undocumented. It is common -- to the tune of billions of dollars each year -- for illegal workers to pay Social Security payroll taxes.

During the 2006 debate, U.S. Sen. John Ensign, R-Nevada, pushed an amendment to block many of those former illegals from getting that credit. The issue was ripe because the immigration bill sought to legalize the status of millions of workers.

Feingold joined the 50-49 majority -- 38 Democrats, 11 Republicans and 1 independent -- to kill the Ensign amendment.

That single vote has spawned campaign ads in at least 29 races, according to our friends at FactCheck.org.

So was that vote, as the most recent Johnson news release put it, a ""vote to grant Social Security benefits for illegal immigrants?""

No.

Nearly all of Johnson’s statements on this leave out the important fact that the 2006 amendment dealt with the policy on payments to formerly illegal workers -- undocumented workers who later were made legal.

Currently illegal immigrants are not eligible for Social Security benefits under U.S. law  -- and that would not have changed even if Ensign’s amendment had passed.

The Social Security Act requires noncitizens in the United State to be ""lawfully present"" to receive benefits, and also prohibits payments to aliens residing in the United States unlawfully, a 2006 Congressional Research Service report noted.

In October 2007, Ensign brought back a much narrower amendment during another immigration debate. The amendment prohibited Social Security payments to persons who had been convicted of misuse of a Social Security number for their work while on illegal status.

Feingold voted in favor of the amendment, which passed 92-2.

Johnson isn’t the only GOP candidate to turn to the issue in this race. In the Nevada U.S. Senate race, PolitiFact National ruled as Barely True a claim that U.S. Sen. Harry Reid voted ""to give illegals Social Security benefits even for the time they were here illegally.""

If anything, Jonson’s claim is more off the mark: It implies currently illegal workers would have benefited.

Where does that leave us?

In just about every venue possible, Republican Ron Johnson is charging Democrat Russ Feingold supported giving Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants. In truth, the 2006 amendment cited by Johnson, which Feingold did oppose, would not have prevented illegals from receiving Social Security benefits. They already were barred. In fact, Feingold wound up voting for a more modest version of the amendment the following year.

This one isn’t a borderline call: False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972B9740>],/factchecks/2010/nov/01/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-us-sen-russ-feingold-voted-give-s/

Livable Damascus says Steve Spinnett has judgments against him for trespass and harassment
","
Anyone following Damascus politics is probably not surprised that the race for mayor has taken a nasty turn. Candidate Steve Spinnett, who has a long history of community and political activism, says political mailings, one of them anonymous, have made wild accusations about him.

He brought several documents to PolitiFact Oregon, and one in particular caught our eye.
A mailer from Livable Damascus stated that Spinnett had previous judgments against him for trespass and harassment. ""In Mr Spinnett’s deposition,"" the mailer said, ""he stated that he had two previous judgments against him,"" for trespass and harassment.
  
Trespass? Harassment? That sounds serious. PolitiFact Oregon decided to check it out.

First we asked representatives of Livable Damascus for the facts to back up their claims. Randy Russell, who signed the mailer, provided court documents from a 1993 civil dispute he and his wife, Kathy, had with Spinnett over trees removed from the Russell property.

The documents refer to a deposition in which Spinnett purportedly acknowledged judgments against him, but Russell couldn’t produce the actual deposition. Kathy Russell said they lost their copy in a flood.

A check of public records showed nothing involving Spinnett and harassment. So we’re left with no proof of that claim.

Next, we turned to Washington County court records, which show there were indeed two entries, both involving trespassing, against Spinnett.

Spinnett explained that the charges came from a peaceful anti-abortion demonstration in Forest Grove back in 1989, through his association with a group called Advocates for Life.

Spinnett was charged with two counts of criminal trespassing in connection with the protest. He was convicted of one in January 1990 and spent two days in jail. The other case was dismissed.

Spinnett was involved in a high-profile anti-abortion case from the past. Advocates for Life and about 30 people including Spinnett were sued by Lovejoy Surgicenter of Portland for blocking doors and preventing patients from entering buildings. The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear an appeal of the $8.2 million damage award Lovejoy won against the protesters. The Oregonian’s coverage of that case notes Spinnett was among the protesters fined $1 for nuisance and $1 for trespassing, in addition to larger awards for the overall judgment.

Remember though, the document released from Livable Damascus claims Spinnett had judgments against him for both trespassing and harassment.

We have one true claim (trespassing) and one claim for which no proof has been offered, which we rate therefore as false (harassment.) When those two are added together, what does the Truth-O-Meter say? Half True.

"['Taxes', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Gov. Rick Perry says he has a track record of not raising taxes
","
Gov. Rick Perry says he's not overlooking any means of closing the state's widely expected revenue shortfall — except higher taxes, according to an Oct. 15 interview with the Texas Tribune. 
""I think for anybody to stand up here and say categorically there's not going to be this or there's not going to be that —"" Perry started, before Evan Smith of the Tribune edged in: ""Well, you said it with taxes."" 
Perry's response: ""Well, but I've got a track record of that too. We don't raise taxes."" 
Later, Smith asked: ""So you don't believe that at any time that anybody reasonably could look over the last 10 years and identify anything where a tax went up?"" Perry agreed. 
We wondered whether Perry had accurately recited his track record as governor. 
After asking his campaign to elaborate, we took up a basic question: Has Perry signed tax hikes into law? 
Boy howdy, yes. 
Since becoming governor in late 2000, Perry has signed into law higher taxes on fireworks and cigarettes while also ushering into place a change in business taxation, according to the state comptroller's office. 
To get a handle on tax changes made early in Perry's governorship, we consulted a 2004 report from the comptroller's office that details the history of revenue-related bills that have become law from 1972 through 2003. Some notables from 2001, Perry's first legislative session as governor, and 2003: 
* House Bill 3667, which Perry signed into law on June 16, 2001, enacting a 2 percent tax on the retail sale of fireworks to help fund a rural volunteer fire department insurance fund. The new levy was projected to generate $848,000 over the next two years; it ended up raising about $1.4 million in that period. 
* Senate Bill 5, which Perry signed into law June 15, 2001, creating the Texas Emissions Reduction Plan Fund as part of an effort to help reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, which are air pollutants. Revenue for the fund was generated through ""several new charges,"" including a tax of 1 percent on the purchase or rental of diesel equipment. 
* House Bill 1365, signed by the governor on June 22, 2003, made tweaks in the emissions reduction fund to bring in more money. With the changes, the report says, the impact to the fund was projected to be $234.9 million in 2004-05. 
Austin consultant Billy Hamilton, who served as deputy comptroller under state Comptrollers John Sharp and Carole Keeton Strayhorn, told us that he doesn't think there was a tax increase per se in 2003. ""There were, however, several fee increases, and one school of thought is that fee is another word for tax,"" he said. 
We gauged Perry's tax record from 2004 to the present from other sources, including news articles and agency communications. 
In 2004, before a special legislative session, Perry laid out a plan to cut local school property taxes while generating new revenue in several ways, including through a $1-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes, a fee on admissions to topless bars, a statewide business property tax, and the closure of loopholes enabling some taxpayers to avoid the state's franchise and motor vehicle taxes, according to an April 2004 press release from his office. The plan went nowhere. 
Lawmakers returned to the school finance topic in a 2006 special session, engineering a tax overhaul that reduced local school property taxes. To help districts offset the loss of revenue, the Legislature revamped the franchise tax, increased the cigarette tax and modified how the state taxes used-car purchases. Perry signed the overhaul legislation into law in May 2006. 
A key goal of the new franchise tax, often called the margins tax, was to apply it to companies that had largely avoided the old corporate franchise tax. As expected at the time, businesses paid more in total after the overhaul of the franchise tax than before, although less than was forecast. Franchise tax revenue had totaled $5.8 billion in 2006 and 2007. In 2008 and 2009, the first two years of the revised tax, total revenue was $8.7 billion. 
However, the 2006 changes didn't affect all businesses the same way, said Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, which represents several hundred largely Texas-based businesses and legal and accounting firms. Because of the property tax reductions, some saw their taxes drop. Others had increases, he said. 
The $1-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes proposed by Perry in 2004 also was part of the 2006 tax changes; the $1.41-a-pack tax took effect in 2007. These increases alone generated $707 million in fiscal 2007 and $908 million in fiscal 2008. 
Lastly, the package required that the sale of used cars be taxed on a standard value ""rather than trusting sellers to report the true sales price,"" according to a May 15, 2006 news article from The Associated Press. The additional revenue from that change was $20.8 million for 2007 and 2008. 
Three tax increases? Sure. However, Perry has stressed that the 2006 increases shouldn't be counted against him because the cuts in local property taxes set in motion by lawmakers were bigger. Told by Smith on Oct. 15 that some people consider the franchise tax change to be an increase, Perry replied: ""That was a net tax decrease."" 
Craymer has a similar view. In an e-mail, he told us that the franchise tax change was a part of a package of bills ""that raised some taxes (franchise, cigarette, motor vehicle sales taxes) and lowered others (property tax) by much more."" Craymer shared a document with us based on the 2006 estimates of the impact of the tax changes; for each year from 2007 to 2011, it shows the property tax reductions as greater than the revenue generated by the other taxes. 
""The new (franchise) tax never would have passed without the property tax cuts, so I don’t think it’s correct to try to look at it independently of the property tax cut,"" he said. 
Like Craymer, Americans for Tax Reform, a Washington-based group that collects pledges by officeholders and seekers not to raise taxes, says it doesn't consider tax swaps to violate the pledge. Spokesman Patrick Gleason told us the group's definition of a tax increase depends on the impact of a law. ""If it's revenue neutral or a net cut, that doesn't violate the pledge,"" he said. 
On Oct. 1, 2009, Perry signed the group's pledge for governors, which says that signatories will ""oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes."" Gleason said Perry hadn't previously signed the pledge. 
Tobacco users were hit again in 2009, when the Legislature decided to tax smokeless tobacco on weight rather than price, ""generating additional revenue of $105 million over two years,"" according to a May 28, 2009 Dallas Morning News news article. According to a December 2009 report from the Legislative Budget Board, some of the new revenue helps repay medical-school loans for doctors who agree to practice in underserved areas of the state. The rest was to be used to help offset franchise tax revenue that was lost when the Legislature temporarily exempted 40,000 businesses. 
Another tax that has jumped recently is the unemployment tax, which businesses pay quarterly to the Texas Workforce Commission to replenish the trust fund that ""provides unemployment insurance for Texas workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own,"" according to a Dec. 8, 2009 news release from the commission. Each year, the commission, whose members are appointed by Perry, sets a rate; it goes up if the balance in the trust fund is below a statutory level as of Oct. 1. 
According to a July 2009 news article in the Austin American-Statesman, ""unemployment taxes rise and fall with the economy, and, in fact, the tax rate fell steadily in Texas between 2004 and 2008."" However, the rate rose in 2009 and 2010, largely because of the impact of the economic downturn. In 2010, the increase in the minimum tax rate meant that most Texas employers would pay $64.80 per employee, compared with $23.40 the previous year. 
Craymer told us that the unemployment tax rate ""is set automatically based on the balance in the fund and is independent of any gubernatorial action."" 
We asked Hamilton about the big picture: Does he see tax increases during Perry's tenure? He said that depends on a person's perspective. ""There were significant tax increases for some taxpayers in 2006 with the cigarette tax and margin tax changes,"" he said. ""However, these are said to have been offset by reductions in school property taxes. In aggregate, that's true, but revenue neutrality is in the eye of the beholder. Some people wound up paying less, but some are paying more."" 
We never heard back from Perry on his tax track record. 
Upshot: Legislation, reports, news articles and expert analysis show that Perry has signed about half a dozen tax increases into law, including the three 2006 changes intended to help cover cuts in school property taxes. 
Texans paying more thanks to Perry's signature on tax-increase measures include companies with higher business taxes, plus cigarette smokers and purchasers of smokeless tobacco, fireworks and diesel equipment. 
We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DEDD40>],/factchecks/2010/nov/01/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-he-has-track-record-not-raisin/
"['Immigration', 'Public Safety', 'Texas', 'Bill White']","
Bill White says that under Rick Perry, state troopers have been under standing orders not to ask anyone's immigration status unless they're under arrest
","
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White recently tromped into touchy territory -- whether state law officers enforce federal immigration law.

White, interviewed Oct. 15 by the Texas Tribune's Evan Smith, started down that road by saying Houston, where he was mayor, is not a ""sanctuary city."" The term ""sanctuary city"" is rooted in the 1980s when some American churches provided sanctuary to thousands of unauthorized Central American migrants fleeing civil war in their homelands.

In a March article, we rated False a statement by the then-chairwoman of the Republican Party of Texas that as mayor, White ""offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants."" A congressional report once listed Houston among localities with sanctuary policies, but the only overt action on White's watch was the decision, at the end of his six years in office, to join the Secure Communities program -- a federal initiative intended to make it harder, not easier, for illegal immigrants to remain in this country.

In the Tribune interview, White said: ""You don't have sanctuary cities by and large in the state of Texas — that's a myth, a complete myth and fabrication. We arrest people every day. (The Houston Police Department) arrests people every week who are non-citizens who commit crimes. The (Texas) Department of Public Safety, under Rick Perry, for the last 9-and-a-half years, has had standing orders that it would not do routine civil immigration work — would not inquire about immigration status for people unless they arrested people for crimes.""

We wondered if White's right that state troopers have standing orders not to ask anyone's immigration status unless they're under arrest.

We asked White's campaign for back-up. In an e-mail, spokeswoman Katy Bacon stressed a May 2010 Tribune article and what the publication described as a relevant state document, ""Enforcement of Federal Immigration Statutes.""

That document opens with a 1978 policy statement by then-U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell, suggesting that local police forces ""do not stop and question, detain, arrest, or place 'an immigration hold' on any persons not suspected of crimes, solely on the grounds that they may be deportable aliens.""

The document says, in part: ""As enforcement of U.S. immigration law is not the primary responsibility of the (DPS), the following policy is adopted to guide department members.""

It goes on: ""Members of this department will not engage in the enforcement of federal Immigration statutes by conducting road checks or business and residence searches unless assisting appropriate federal officers who have properly requested such assistance."" The next section states: ""Members may arrest aliens under the following situations: 1. When serving a valid warrant after checking to see that the warrant is current. 2. For violation of state laws the same as any U. S. citizen."" The next section states: ""Members will not arrest without a warrant an alien solely on the suspicion that he has entered the country illegally.""

Next, we asked DPS to confirm the authenticity of the policy. In the meantime, we found similar text posted online by the Texas Sunset Advisory Commission in 2008. On what looks like two web pages from the DPS's internal website, guidance identical to what the Tribune published is presented under: ""General Manual, Chapter 5.""

In addition, we found a ""statewide agreement"" on the Sunset site prefaced by an April 1, 1990, interoffice memo from Joe E. Milner, then the agency's director, stating that a lawsuit against DPS regarding arrests of illegal aliens ""has been settled. As part of that settlement, we are to provide all commissioned officers of the department with this attached statewide agreement, which enunciates our agreement and policy with regard to· the handling of illegal aliens.""

Dated February 1990, the 16-point agreement says DPS shall not enforce federal civil statutes and regulations regarding immigration or question any person, including those stopped on traffic or criminal charges, ""about their right to be in or to remain in the United States"" or ""about their nationality, national origin or place of birth for the purpose of enforcing the civil immigration laws.""

Talk about clear-cut orders!

We wanted DPS's perspective on the document, in part because it appears to be more than 20 years old. What did it settle? Does it still apply? DPS spokesman Tom Vinger declined to comment on this front. Earlier, he said the policy published by the Tribune is ""outdated."" His e-mail continues: ""All of our law enforcement policies are undergoing legal and best practices review, and will be updated as needed.""  
We didn't land any document from DPS spelling out its policy. Instead, Vinger quoted DPS Director Steve McCraw saying that under DPS's ""operational policy,"" if an officer has ""reasonable suspicion that a person is in violation of a federal immigration law the department will refer that person"" to the U.S. Border Patrol or the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement ""for immediate action.""

""Can DPS troopers ask someone if they are here illegally when they pull someone over?"" McCraw said via Vinger. ""A trooper does not ask someone whether they are here legally or illegally when they are stopped; however, once a trooper has a reasonable suspicion that a federal violation has occurred, including immigration, the appropriate federal agency is contacted immediately to take appropriate action.""

How long has this ""operational"" policy been in place? ""Several years,"" said Vinger. ""I don’t have a specific time frame."" 
To recap, White didn't show us evidence of so-called standing orders forbidding officers to ask into anyone's immigration status unless they're under arrest. And DPS didn't cough up a document spelling out a different policy.
 
However, the agency does say its officers do not ask into the legality of anyone's presence here. That seems to hint at standing orders. Without those orders in hand, though, we rate White's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280FFBCC780>],/factchecks/2010/nov/01/bill-white/bill-white-says-under-rick-perry-state-troopers-ha/
"['Energy', 'Negative Campaigning', 'Virginia', 'Sierra Club']","
Conservation groups accuse Robert Hurt of conflict-of-interest on uranium vote.
","The television and direct-mail ads aimed at state Sen. Robert Hurt’s vote on a uranium mining study say he’s guilty of a ""shocking conflict of interest.""

The ads are shocking all right, but not necessarily for the reasons stated by the conservation groups that produced the ads.

Hurt, a Republican, is running to unseat Democratic Rep. Tom Perriello in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District.

The TV ad, ""Robert Hurt’s Shocking Conflict of Interest,"" challenges  Hurt’s decision to vote in 2008 on a Senate bill that would have created a commission to study the potential for uranium mining in Virginia, which has been banned since 1982.

The ads produced by the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters call Hurt’s decision to vote yes on the bill ""a shocking conflict of interest ... maybe it’s because Hurt’s father has a financial interest in uranium mining, or because Hurt has taken thousands from uranium interests.""

A subsequent direct-mail ad goes further, saying:. ""When family money is involved, a radioactive conflict of interest means nothing to Robert Hurt.""

That’s a nuclear statement that ends up half-baked.

The TV ad overstates Hurt’s personal ties to the uranium industry, and three direct-mail ads take the issue over the top. One, showing a young girl on a swing and bearing the headline, ""There’s a hidden danger lurking underground ...,""  resembles an infamous Lyndon Johnson ad in the 1964 presidential race that featured a girl picking flower petals moments before a nuclear explosion.

Hurt’s campaign called the ad ""a despicable, false negative attack"" run by ""liberal special-interest groups on Congressman Perriello’s behalf."" Perriello’s campaign said the issue demonstrates the danger of accepting political contributions from corporate interests.

We agree the ads go too far, but the issue of uranium mining is legitimate and timely. Last Tuesday, the National Academy of Sciences convened the first meeting of a one-year study requested by the state and paid for by a uranium company headquartered in Chatham, Hurt’s hometown in Pittsylvania County.

Hurt’s father, Henry C. Hurt Jr., is an investor in the company, Virginia Uranium Inc. It was formed in 2007 by Walter Coles Sr., whose farm, Coles Hill, contains a major deposit of uranium discovered in the late 1970s.

The study was requested by the Virginia Coal and Energy Commission last year, but Hurt’s alleged conflict occurred more than a year earlier in a vote in the Virginia Senate on a bill to authorize the study. That bill eventually died in the House of Delegates but Virginia Uranium  is paying $1.4 million for the National Academy of Sciences Study, which will examine the potential socioeconomic impact of allowing uranium mining in Virginia.

It is indisputable that Hurt’s father -- a writer, local bookseller and former Reader’s Digest editor -- invested in Virginia Uranium in 2007. The connection was documented in articles published by the Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Washington Post that were cited in the ads. The elder Hurt is unabashed about his support for the business.

""I am delighted to be one of the founding investors in the company,"" Hurt told us.

Prior to the uranium study bill coming to the Senate floor, Hurt asked the Senate ethics panel if it  would be a conflict of interest for him to vote on the matter. The panel, controlled by Democrats, advised that he was not in conflict and gave him a green light to vote.

The panel ruled that under Virginia’s ethics laws, Hurt’s father is not part of the senator’s ""immediate family"" and their financial interests were not entwined. It also said Hurt could vote ""because the impact of a proposed study on his father’s financial interests are speculative and because the study may have a broad impact on persons interested in uranium mining.""

The bill passed the Senate by a 36-4 vote, with Hurt voting yes.

The conservation groups correctly say voters have a right to make up their own minds about whether the vote was a conflict. While the bill only would have created a study, opponents of uranium mining -- including the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club -- prefer maintaining the ban.

Technically, the ads are correct about Hurt’s contributions from uranium interests, but by the barest of margins.  Walter Coles Jr., a vice president of Virginia Uranium and son of its CEO, gave three checks totaling $1,500 over a period of seven years to then-Del. Hurt, who ran for the state Senate in 2007. Norman W. Reynolds, who was the first CEO of Virginia Uranium, gave Hurt’s campaign $500 in 2007. Together, that’s $2,000, just qualifying for the ""thousands,"" in contributions claimed in the TV ad.

The conservation groups also based the claim on $7,054 in contributions made to Hurt over five years by his father, who presumably had plenty of reasons other  than uranium mining for supporting his son. All of the father’s donations were made before 2006, when Henry Hurt said he began exploring investing in mining for uranium.

Further, most of the contributions weren’t cash at all. About $5,300 came in donations of office space, a political luncheon, and food for a police dinner.

""It’s just despicable, scurrilous,"" Henry Hurt said of the ads in an interview with PolitiFact.

So let’s review the key facts in the claim that Hurt put his own interests ahead of the public by voting on the Senate uranium study bill.

Hurt did vote for the bill, and he accepted $2,000 cash contributions from uranium industry executives, barely justifyinghe Sierra Club’s claim.

His father also contributed to his campaigns, but those donations came before the elder Hurt invested in uranium. There is no question his father stands to gain if uranium mining is allowed in Virginia, but Hurt disclosed that and was cleared by the Senate ethics panel to vote on the issue.

Therefore, we find the claim to be Barely True.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Military', 'Technology', 'Joe Manchin']","
Lasers in the sky? The military is trying it.
","
An ad from Joe Manchin, the Democratic candidate for Senate in West Virginia, uses a Star Wars theme to target his opponent as ""Darth Raese."" (Watch it before George Lucas' lawyers hear about it.)

The Web ad shows video of John Raese, the Republican candidate, making these statements:

""We need 1,000 laser systems put in the sky, and we need it right now.""

""I'm in the business of not providing jobs, I'm in the business of making money.""

""I don't agree with minimum wage.""

""We don't need the Department of Education.""

Manchin then uses a hunting rifle to shoot down a TIE fighter. (Not kidding!)

The ad concludes, ""No more crazy John Raese ideas.""

Raese does oppose the minimum wage, on the grounds that the free market should set wages; he recently defended that view in a candidates' debate. He also thinks the U.S. Department of Education should be abolished, because states and counties should run schools. His comment on business was a strong defense of the profit motive in running a business.

But we were perplexed by his comment, ""We need 1,000 laser systems put in the sky, and we need it right now."" Manchin's ad provides it without context, as if Raese is calling for construction of the Death Star. So we decided to check into it.

We tracked the comments back to an NBC News report about comments Raese made at a voters' forum sponsored in part by the tea party movement.

Here's a fuller version of what he said (watch the video):

""I want to put in a strategic defense initiative in this country that will take care of us and our friends ... Strategic Defense Initiative, better known as Star Wars: We need to bring it back,"" Raese said, referring to a defense program proposed by President Ronald Reagan.

He said the U.S. should not negotiate with countries like Iran. He also made fun of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's name while the audience laughed.

""What you do with them is you put them on notice that we have a defense system in our country that is the best, the best. Right now, any nuclear weapon launched from North Korea can hit Alaska and can almost hit California,"" he said.

""We are sitting with the only technology in the world that works, and it's laser technology. We need 1,000 laser systems put in the sky, and we need it right now. That is (of) paramount importance,"" he said.

The Raese campaign confirmed the extended remarks and pointed us to two opinion pieces by The Heritage Foundation that advocate missile defense, which means developing ways to intercept and destroy in-flight missiles launched by hostile forces. That would primarily be done by anti-ballistic missiles, but there's also been considerable research into Reagan's proposal to use some type of lasers. The pieces note correctly that Reagan was a strong supporter of missile defense. In recent years, President George W. Bush supported a long-range missile defense shield in Poland. President Barack Obama, on the other hand, scrapped the Bush administration plan in favor of a system designed to down short- and medium-range missiles from sites closer to Iran.

So the ""1,000 laser systems put in the sky"" is a reference to a longer-term plan for missile defense that presumably would use lasers instead of missiles (hence, the ""Star Wars"" theme.)

If you think using lasers for missile defense is fanciful, we should point out that the military is actively studying the use of lasers to knock missiles out of the sky. The technology remains controversial, though, because some military officials believe it hasn't really worked and is too expensive. In a test on Oct. 23, 2010, a jumbo jet outfitted with a laser gun failed to knock a test missile out of the sky as part of the Airborne Laser Test Bed program.

In May 2009, Defense Secretary Robert Gates told Congress that he wanted to continue funding prototype testing as part of basic research, but that it was not realistic to use anti-missile lasers any time soon. Gates said a basic program near Iran, for example, would require 10 to 20 jets costing $1.5 billion each, plus hundreds of millions in operating expenses. ""And there's nobody in uniform that I know who believes that this is a workable concept,"" he added.

Getting back to the Manchin video, Raese may have been speaking a little hyperbolically about putting ""1,000 lasers systems in the sky."" Clearly, the Manchin campaign could have used a more straightforward quote to indicate what Raese was talking about, but they cherry-picked a quote that sounded the most nutty.
