Larry Elder mislabels statistics on fatal shootings by police
","As the U.S. entered a second week of protests after the death of George Floyd, conservative radio host Larry Elder argued that ""cops rarely kill anybody, let alone an unarmed black person."" ""Last year, there were nine unarmed black people killed. Nineteen unarmed white people,"" Elder said June 2 on Fox News host Sean Hannity’s TV show. A reader asked us about Elder’s numbers, which he repeated on Twitter, so we decided to put them to the Truth-O-Meter.  How many unarmed blacks were killed by cops last year? 9. How many unarmed whites were killed by cops last year? 19. More officers are killed every year than are unarmed blacks. When do the #BlueLivesMatter protests begin?#GeorgeFloyd We found that Elder was speaking broadly about police killings but pulling his numbers from the Washington Post’s more narrow tally of fatal shootings by police officers in the line of duty.  The Washington Post’s tally doesn’t account for off-duty police or the use by on-duty officers of other force that can be lethal, such as tasers or physical restraint.  That means the number of unarmed people killed in encounters with law enforcement in 2019 is higher for both races than Elder claimed. How much higher is not clear.  What is clear, experts told us, is that despite what Elder’s absolute numbers may suggest, black people in the U.S. have died from fatal encounters with police at a disproportionate rate.  RELATED: TikTok video misleads on police shooting data The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FBI keep tabs on deaths resulting from interactions with police, but both sources provide incomplete data that takes years to record.  More reliable data comes from the Washington Post and projects such as Mapping Police Violence and Fatal Encounters. In emails to PolitiFact, Elder cited a tweet and a Wall Street Journal op-ed that pulled numbers from the Washington Post’s database. According to the Washington Post data through June 3, police in the line of duty fatally shot 10 unarmed black people and 20 unarmed white people in 2019. (The data is updated as new facts emerge, and by June 5 the numbers jumped to 15 unarmed blacks and 25 unarmed whites.) But Elder incorrectly claimed that his statistics represented the numbers of all black and white Americans who were killed by police, not the number of ""shootings in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shoots and kills a civilian,"" as the Washington Post describes its data. The Washington Post doesn’t account for deaths like Floyd’s, for example. Floyd died in police custody May 25 after an officer in Minneapolis kneeled on his neck. When we asked about this incongruity, Elder told us that the majority of police killings involve firearms, ""so the number is not likely much bigger."" It’s hard to say how much bigger it is.  As of June 3, Mapping Police Violence had counted 28 unarmed blacks and 51 unarmed whites who died at the hands of police in 2019.  Those numbers are higher than the Washington Post’s in part because Mapping Police Violence tracks police killings more broadly and includes officers who are off duty.  In 2019, among those who were unarmed when they encountered police, there were five black people and 12 white people who died from tasers, beatings or other uses of force by police, according to Mapping Police Violence’s data. Off-duty officers killed four unarmed blacks and five unarmed whites. Those deaths won’t show up in the Washington Post data. Another reason Mapping Police Violence counted more unarmed people killed by police is that it considered victims in possession of toy guns, BB guns, airsoft guns or rocks to be unarmed. The Washington Post’s database doesn’t include those people in its unarmed tallies. In 2019, at least eight black people and 16 white people were killed by police while in possession of a toy weapon or something similar, according to Mapping Police Violence. There are also numerous 2019 cases, in both data sets, where the victim’s armed status remains unknown or the victim was considered armed with a vehicle. Overall, the data on whether police-killing victims were armed or unarmed is ""messy,"" said Frank Edwards, an assistant professor at Rutgers University’s School of Criminal Justice who co-authored a study on police killings.  Because groups that track the data often cite news reports that rely only on the word of police to establish whether a person was armed or unarmed, ""the data likely over-report the armed status of victims and the danger faced by police,"" Edwards said.  ""Police have been known to misrepresent the danger presented by suspects,"" he said. The data we have is also limited to deaths, said Lorie Fridell, professor of criminology at the University of South Florida. Ideally, she said, we would be able track police use of force more broadly, including force that could be deadly but doesn’t turn out to be fatal. Elder’s claim also ignores the fact that the same Washington Post data shows black people are disproportionately shot and killed by police, experts said. ""There may be more unarmed whites than unarmed blacks killed each year, but the rate of shooting unarmed blacks is much larger,"" Fridell said, citing a report from the Washington Post that summarized years of findings from its database. Black Americans represent 13% of the U.S. population, the report said, but they accounted for about a quarter of police shooting victims over four and a half years of data collection. ""They're over-represented in the data,"" said Brian Burghart, the founder of Fatal Encounters. Elder said: ""Last year, there were nine unarmed black people killed (by law enforcement). Nineteen unarmed white people."" Those numbers matched the Washington Post’s tally of fatal shootings by police in the line of duty, although the Washington Post’s figures have increased since Elder made his claim.  But not all police killings happen when officers are on duty, and not all involve a gunshot. The Washington Post’s data doesn’t include deaths like Floyd’s, for example. Elder’s claim also omitted important context: that black people in the U.S. are disproportionately killed by police relative to their share of the population. Overall, Elder’s statement contained elements of truth, but it left out important context that would give a different impression.  We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/jun/05/larry-elder/larry-elder-mislabels-statistics-fatal-shootings-p/

Have Austin police officers been 'authorized' to use live rounds, deadly force?
","Law enforcement officers in Austin used pepper spray, tear gas and less-lethal ammunition against demonstrators during daily protests against racism and police brutality following the death of George Floyd and in remembrance of Mike Ramos, an unarmed man who was shot and killed in late April by Austin police officers. Floyd was a 46-year-old black man who was arrested by police in Minneapolis and died after an officer knelt on his neck for eight minutes while handcuffed. Social media posts circulating online suggested that Austin Police officers were using live rounds and ""lethal force"" against protesters over the weekend. One post included an image that appears to be a screenshot of an Instagram story that read: ""APD has been authorized to use LIVE ROUNDS, and lethal force. Confirmed by multiple police radio scanners. If you are deciding to stay and protest be VERY aware of your surroundings, and get out before you can’t anymore."" In a direct message on Twitter, the original poster, whose name on Twitter is ""DeathwishDena,"" said they got the information from a friend, but ""I did not 100% verify it."" ""I didn’t necessarily want to spread false information, but also didn’t want people being out and unaware if something (were) to go sideways,"" they said. Multiple other social media posts being shared online include similar claims, attributed either to chatter from police scanners or people in the area. Other posts include the same warning about different cities. But is this post about Austin accurate?  Officers with the Austin Police Department do not need prior authorization to use deadly force, so long as an officer is acting within the scope of the Texas penal code. Any time an officer uses deadly force, there is an investigation within the department to determine whether the officer violated policy and an investigation to determine whether they violated the law. Department guidelines outline levels of force available to officers to use in response to resistance, ranging from de-escalation communication techniques to the use of chemical agents and kinetic projectiles (less-lethal rounds) to the use of deadly force. Police Chief Brian Manley said no live rounds were fired on protesters during a video chat with reporters on Monday. ""The Austin Police Department did not fire any live rounds for any type of duty pistol or rifle this weekend, and the ammunition that was fired was that less lethal bean bag round that I talked about earlier,"" he said. Officers with the department used pepper spray, ""less lethal impact munitions,"" hand-thrown smoke cylinders and hand-thrown CS gas (or tear gas) for crowd management, Manley said, noting that conditions on the ground met the required criteria for the use of these tactics. Some individual cases are still under review. In a video distributed to officers ahead of the city’s first protest on May 31, Manley said Floyd’s death is ""a stain on our profession"" that ""comes on the heels of many instances like this that have played out across the country over the decade."" ""I urge you in the days and weeks ahead to be mindful of this and to understand that we have a community that is hurting right now,a community that has a lot of questions,"" Manley said. ""Give that extra ounce of care when you are out there; that extra ounce of deference, understanding where we’re at right now as a society coming to terms with what happened."" Several people were injured by bean bag rounds fired by officers during the protests that followed, including a 16-year-old and a 20-year-old who were both shot in the head by these munitions. Ernesto Rodriguez, Chief of the Austin-Travis County Emergency Management Services, described some of the more serious injuries during an Austin City Council meeting on Friday. No injuries with live rounds were reported. Rodriguez said these injuries are potentially lethal and could involve significant recovery time and medical care. On Thursday, Manley said officers would stop using bean bag projectiles in crowd situations.  Deadly force in the penal code The Austin Police Department’s General Orders include a section about the department’s ""philosophy, values and mission,"" which includes a mention of the possible use of deadly force while on duty. ""As such, all employees will strive to preserve human life while recognizing that duty may require the use of deadly force, as a last resort, after other reasonable alternatives have failed or been determined impractical,"" the manual reads. The manual goes on to reference Texas law surrounding the use of deadly force and states that it is only justified to the extent an individual officer ""reasonably believes the deadly force is immediately necessary"" to protect him or herself or others from an imminent threat of death or serious injury.  It is also justified under law when an officer is making an arrest or preventing an escape after an arrest and has probable cause to believe the person has inflicted serious injury or death or intends to commit such an act. ""Lethal force as a response to a lethal threat is always available,"" said Margaret Moore, the Travis County District Attorney, pointing to the state penal code statute on ""justifiable force."" ""But you can’t just unleash the police to go kill people,"" she said. ""The same law is going to apply no matter what and we’re still going to have the inquiry.""  Moore said the ""law of justification"" for deadly force is the same for law enforcement officers as it is for civilians. The Texas Penal Code states that a person is justified in using deadly force in self-defense, in defense of another person, in protection of life or health, or in protection of property. If an officer uses deadly force, it prompts a law enforcement investigation and possible charges from Moore’s office, depending on whether they believe the officer was ""justified"" in using deadly force under the law. Our ruling A post on Twitter said officers with the Austin Police Department have been ""authorized to use LIVE ROUNDS, and lethal force"" against demonstrators protesting police brutality.  Law enforcement officers do not need authorization to use deadly force, so long as a situation meets the criteria outlined in the Austin Police Department’s handbook and in state law.  Officers with the department have not used live rounds on protesters during demonstrations in the city, but have fired less lethal projectiles like bean bag bullets. Several people were injured during protests over the weekend. Law enforcement officers always have deadly force as an option, but they were not specially ordered to use this force during the protests, as the post implies.

No evidence this man died at hands of an ‘antifa murderer’
","Amid many peaceful Black Lives Matter protests, there have been instances of violence that resulted in death. One alarming social media post claims that one of those deaths was the result of an attack by an ""antifa murderer."" The June 3 Facebook post includes many pictures of a young man in a black shirt and a white mask at a protest. In one picture it appears he is kicking someone who is face-down on the ground wearing a blue shirt and light blue jeans. ""This man who was kicked and stomped has died,"" the post claims. ""The antifa murderer is in the white mask."" It then calls for anyone who recognizes the man to call the police or the FBI. This post was flagged by Facebook as part of efforts to combat false news and information on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This attack did happen, and the victim was seriously injured. But police confirmed that he survived, and said they had arrested a teenage suspect. There is no evidence that the person attacking him is part of antifa, a loosely organized left-wing movement that at times uses violence. This attack happened on May 30 in Portland, Ore., at the intersection of SW 4th Street and SW Salmon Street, where journalists photographed protests against police brutality around 8 p.m. Based on a review of images and videos tweeted and shared by journalists, it appears that the victim seen lying on the ground in these photos was involved in a skirmish immediately prior to what we see in this Facebook post. And videos also show that after these pictures were taken, he was able to stand and speak to others who came to his aid. In a video posted by a journalist from the Oregonian newspaper, a large crowd is seen attacking a man with a flag. Twenty-eight seconds in, we see the man in the blue shirt and light blue jeans run into the melee and become involved in the conflict with his arms swinging. In a separate video of the same incident captured by another Oregonian journalist from a different angle, it looks like the man is punching and pushing someone before exiting the crowd again. As the man walks from the scene, according to a third video tweeted by conservative journalist Andy Ngo, two men start chasing him. One pushes him, and the man in blue collapses face-down. Then another man, wearing a black T-shirt, kicks him in the head before fleeing. ""He’s dead,"" we hear someone yell. But as the video continues, we see others come to the man’s aid, treating his wounds, helping him off the ground and talking to him. Ngo, of conservative Canadian website The Post Millennial, on May 31 posted a compilation of pictures similar to those seen in the Facebook post and identified the attackers as ""antifa."" On June 4, Portland police announced that with ""the public's help, the suspect who was kicking the victim in the head was identified and detectives were notified."" The 14-year-old suspect was charged with felony assault and taken to a juvenile detention center, while the investigation continues. Portland police said in their statement that ""the male victim sustained serious injuries but is not deceased."" Sgt. Michael Roberts told PolitiFact that the police currently have no evidence of antifa being involved in this incident. A Facebook post claimed that an ""antifa murderer"" had killed a man that ""was kicked and stomped"" at a protest. There is no evidence that the attackers are part of the antifa movement. The attack took place where many were peacefully protesting the Minneapolis police’s treatment of George Floyd.  According to videos of the attack from journalists at the protest, the man in the blue shirt got up after the attack and was walking around and talking. Portland police also confirmed in a press release that the victim isn’t dead. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2020/jun/05/facebook-posts/no-evidence-man-died-hands-antifa-murderer/

Vietnam memorial was not vandalized by Black Lives Matter protesters
","In an effort to show how nationwide Black Lives Matter demonstrations have gotten out of hand, some Facebook users are pointing to the scene of a crime — a 2016 crime, that is. A June 3 Facebook post claims that some people protesting the death of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody after a white officer kneeled on his neck, have vandalized a veterans memorial. ""If you stand for this you are the problem!!!"" the poster wrote in the caption. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) The photo is real — but it doesn’t show vandalism caused by recent Black Lives Matter protesters. In May 2016, vandals spray-painted graffiti on a Vietnam War memorial in Venice, Calif. The memorial was one of several around the country that was vandalized before Memorial Day that year. Images of the defaced mural in 2016 appear to match up with the image shared in the Facebook post. Los Angeles detectives identified four people behind the vandalism, which was not connected to a Black Lives Matter protest. Since Floyd’s death on May 25, demonstrations have erupted in more than 350 American cities. Protesters in Washington, D.C., have defaced some war monuments, including the World War II Memorial. In the wake of last night's demonstrations, there are numerous instances of vandalism to sites around the National Mall. For generations the Mall has been our nation’s premier civic gathering space for non-violent demonstrations, and we ask individuals to carry on that tradition. pic.twitter.com/LmIHfW2AHj But as of now, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington remains untouched.  ""I have had no reports of it being vandalized,"" said Sgt.

Donald Trump’s Pants on Fire claim that he gave Jim Mattis the nickname 'Mad Dog'
","President Donald Trump has often lashed out at those who criticize him, especially if they are former insiders. The pattern repeated itself on June 3, just hours after his first defense secretary, retired Gen. James Mattis, published criticism of Trump, writing that Trump ""is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people—does not even pretend to try."" In a tweet, Trump wrote, ""Probably the only thing Barack Obama & I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world’s most overrated General. I asked for his letter of resignation, & felt great about it. His nickname was ‘Chaos,’ which I didn’t like, & changed to ‘Mad Dog.’"" Probably the only thing Barack Obama & I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world’s most overrated General. I asked for his letter of resignation, & felt great about it. His nickname was “Chaos”, which I didn’t like, & changed to “Mad Dog”... It’s not the first time Trump claimed to have given Mattis the nickname ""Mad Dog."" In a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2019, Trump said he told Mattis ""we’re going to give you a new nickname, because ‘Chaos’ is not a good nickname. So we changed it to ‘Mad Dog.’"" In reality, though, Mattis’ ""Mad Dog"" nickname was in common circulation long before Trump tapped him for his cabinet. It dates back at least as far as 2004, and probably well before that. (The White House and the Trump campaign did not respond to inquiries for this article.) On April 16, 2004, the Los Angeles Times published an article filed from Iraq headlined, ""Marines’ ‘Mad Dog Mattis’ Battles for Iraqis’ Support."" The article said, ""Behind his back, troops call him ‘Mad Dog Mattis,’ high praise in Marine culture. ‘He can swear as much as any enlisted man,’ a corporal said."" Later that year, the Los Angeles Times published another article that referred to the nickname, saying that the general was ""known as ‘Mad Dog Mattis’ to his men."" The earliest instance of Trump calling Mattis ""Mad Dog"" that we could find from searching Google and Nexis was on Nov. 20, 2016, when Trump tweeted, ""General James ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General!"" General James ""Mad Dog"" Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General! During the confirmation hearing for his nomination as Defense secretary in January 2017, Mattis told senators that the nickname ""was given to me by the press, and some of you may have experienced similar occasions with the press where perhaps they didn't get it quite right."" News reports have suggested that Mattis has not been a big fan of his nickname. Meanwhile, the nickname ""Chaos"" that Trump referenced comes from the acronym for ""the colonel has an outstanding solution,"" something his troops said as a gentle dig behind his back in the 1990s, according to the Marine Corps Times. Trump said that Mattis’ ""nickname was ‘Chaos,’ which I didn’t like, & changed to ‘Mad Dog.’"" This is the second time that Trump has said he gave Mattis his ""Mad Dog"" nickname, but it’s flat wrong. The nickname dates back at least as far as 2004, when it was used in the headline of a Los Angeles Times article — 12 years before Trump first used the nickname publicly as he was considering Mattis as his Defense Secretary.

Facebook post cites wrong fast-food CEO as big Trump donor
","Wendy’s, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut are facing turbulence on social media from an assertion that their CEO has donated $400,000 to the re-election campaign of President Donald Trump. ""The CEO of the company that owns Wendy’s, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut donated $400,000 towards Trump’s re-election campaign,"" a June 1 post with 89,000 shares said. ""Y’all still finna be eating there?""  Other posts echoed this message, with one saying, ""Wendy’s is cancelled. donated 400k to trump. I repeat, Wendy’s is cancelled."" However, this claim is garbled. The executive who gave six-figure donations to the Trump re-election effort is the franchisee of a smaller number of Wendy’s, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut locations in the southwestern United States, not the CEO of Louisville-based Yum! Brands, the global fast-food company that owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. (Wendy's is a separate company.) The Trump-supporting executive in question is James Bodenstedt, the founder of San Antonio, Texas-based MUY! Brands, a fast-food franchising company with Wendy’s, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut locations. (MUY! is Yum! spelled backwards.) On Federal Election Commission disclosure forms the past two years, Bodenstedt has identified himself as either president or CEO of MUY! Consulting. The website of MUY! Brands doesn’t list its current number of locations, but a 2012 article in a trade publication that the company posted on its website said at that time it had 230 locations in Texas and New Mexico. The article described MUY! as ""one of the nation’s largest Yum! Brands franchisees."" Bodenstedt has indeed been a generous donor to the Trump re-election effort.  Just during the 2020 campaign cycle, he has made 44 donations to entities working to re-elect Trump, according to Federal Election Commission disclosure forms: • The Trump campaign: $200; • Trump Victory, a joint fundraising vehicle that benefits both Trump and the Republican National Committee: $400,000; • The Republican National Committee: $144,200. These donations total $544,400 so far, and they could grow as the campaign progresses. Bodenstedt also donated to other state and national Republican entities beyond those that specifically promote Trump’s re-election. In mid-May, Business Insider reported that Bodenstedt was one of the fast-food industry figures advising Trump on the restaurant sector’s struggles with the coronavirus pandemic. The CEO of Yum! Brands, David Gibbs, has not been a major political donor.  This cycle, Gibbs has made two donations totaling $4,180, and they were to the company’s political action committee, or PAC. A PAC is a vehicle for company executives and certain employees to pool their money so it can be donated directly to candidates and other political committees. The PAC, called the Yum! Brands Inc. Good Government Fund, has made donations so far this cycle totaling a little over $60,000. Its recipients have included both Republicans and Democrats. The Republican recipients include former Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, John Cornyn of Texas, and Cory Gardner of Colorado, and Reps. Greg Walden of Oregon and Hal Rogers of Kentucky. The Democrats include Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Gary Peters of Michigan and Reps. Stephanie Murphy of Florida and Steven Horsford of Nevada. Wendy's CEO Todd A. Penegor has donated only to his company's PAC, disclosures show. In turn, the Wendy's Company Political Action Committee has donated to multiple Republican lawmakers but also to such Democratic Reps. as Joyce Beatty of Ohio, Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Jimmy Panetta and Jim Costa of California, and Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. The PAC has not donated to the Trump campaign or outside groups supporting him. A Facebook post said that ""the CEO of the company that owns Wendy’s, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut donated $400,000 towards Trump’s re-election campaign."" This assertion has been garbled. Bodenstedt, the founder of a major Wendy’s, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut franchisee, has donated $544,400 to entities supporting Trump’s re-election so far this campaign cycle.

White House says officers didn’t fire tear gas, rubber bullets on protesters. Why that’s misleading
","Federal officers’ use of force to clear the area around a church where President Donald Trump was due to visit June 1 has drawn the American public into the nuances of tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper balls. When a reporter asked White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany if the administration had second thoughts about gassing and pummeling protestors, McEnany rejected the premise of the question.  ""Let me first address, no tear gas was used and no rubber bullets were used,"" McEnany said June 3. ""Chemical agents were used,"" the reporter responded. ""Again, no tear gas was used and no rubber bullets were used,"" McEnany repeated. McEnany’s claim hinges on technical distinctions. But experts we reached said for someone on the receiving end of these crowd-dispersing agents, the differences might be hard to discern. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts all manner of chemical crowd control agents into the same bucket. ""Riot control agents (sometimes referred to as ‘tear gas’) are chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin,"" the agency’s website says. The U.S. Park Police said in a statement that officers ""employed the use of smoke canisters and pepper balls."" Multiple eyewitnesses and news accounts reported noxious fumes that caused protesters’ eyes and throats to burn. As federal officers fired on the crowd near the church, protesters cried out that tear gas was being used. There were calls to put on masks. Tear gas just deployed at 16th & H Streets, police in riot gear & on horseback pushed the crowd back to Connecticut Av #dcprotest pic.twitter.com/LOd2UC5nmH The U.S. Park Police press office told PolitiFact that officers used products made by the PepperBall company, which contain the chemical irritant pelargonic acid vanillylamide, or PAVA. ""PAVA primarily affects the eyes causing closure and severe pain,"" according to a report by Britain's Committee on Toxicity, an independent scientific body that advises the government. PAVA closely matches the CDC’s description of tear gas. McEnany emphasized that rubber bullets were not used. Pepper balls cause pain on impact all the same, experts said.  Rubber bullets and pepper balls come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but the general difference is that rubber bullets are designed to cause pain, while pepper balls cause both pain on impact and the discomfort of a chemical irritant payload. Rubber bullets weigh much more than pepper balls, but with muzzle speeds of over 300 feet per second, both projectiles hurt on impact. (The actual impact speed depends on the distance between shooter and shootee.) Few, if any, academic researchers would be able to compare the two as well as Ed Maguire. Maguire, a professor at Arizona State University, studies crowd control. In the course of his field work, he’s been hit by both a pepper ball and a rubber bullet. In 2017, he and four graduate students were caught up in a clash between pro-Trump and anti-Trump groups in Phoenix. When police moved in, a pepper ball hit Maguire about half an inch above his right eye.  ""I thought I had been stuck by the corner of a brick,"" Maguire said. ""I was delirious in the first couple of seconds. And I couldn't feel the top of my head, my scalp, for about a month."" The next morning, Mcguire discovered a rubber bullet had hit him in the stomach, leaving a large, telltale bruise. He hadn’t felt it the night before. ""In terms of the level of pain, I think I was hit by both at about the same time,"" Maguire said. ""The pepper ball won the contest."" Maguire said police use rubber bullets and pepper balls interchangeably, according to local preference. ""There’s no fundamental strategic reason to choose one over the other,"" Maguire said. ""They are both impact munitions."" An early government sponsored study put rubber bullets and pepper balls in the same category of non-lethal impact munitions. One intrepid rock-and-roll DJ in Lubbock, Texas, put himself on the business end of a pepper ball pistol. When the round hit him in the chest at very close range, he instantly dropped to the ground. (Watch it if you like.) McEnany said that neither tear gas nor rubber bullets were used in removing a group of people from the area around a church in Washington. Tear gas, according to the CDC, includes a broad range of chemical agents, and the one used by federal police falls under the government’s description of teargas. Rubber bullets are different from the pepper balls fired by federal police, but both are fired at similar speeds, both can cause extreme pain, and both are characterized as impact munitions. McEnany makes much of the differences in the delivery systems, but the practical effects are similar.

During her June 1 interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, the Democrat and former California attorney general spoke about George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd’s May 25 death has prompted thousands of people to protest daily across the nation. They say they want justice for Floyd and an end to police brutality. As part of that process, Harris said, the United States needs to continue the police oversight done by former President Barack Obama and his administration, such as pattern-or-practice investigations of police departments. ""Donald Trump came in with Jeff Sessions and undid those,"" Harris said. ""Barack Obama and his administration did do the work of enforcing consent decrees on police departments that had been found to engage in misconduct. Donald Trump came in and undid those."" Is it accurate that the Trump administration ""undid"" investigations of police departments and consent decrees, as Harris claimed? We found the assessment to be largely on point: Such investigations have not ceased altogether, but they have declined and are disfavored by the Trump administration. A spokesman for Harris said the senator wasn’t saying that investigations or consent decrees were banned, but that they had diminished under Trump. Congress in 1994 gave the U.S. attorney general the authority to investigate and litigate cases of police patterns or practices that violate constitutional or federal rights. This happened after a video of the 1991 beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police officers fueled public outrage and the subsequent 1992 riots and protests over police officers acquitted on state criminal charges. The U.S. Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division performs the investigations to ensure that police departments are policing lawfully and fairly. These types of investigations don’t center on one single incident. They examine broader behavior to determine whether there’s misconduct within a department. Investigations may examine whether a police department has a pattern or practice of stops, searches, or arrests that violate the Fourth Amendment; use of excessive force; discriminatory policing; and violation of criminal suspects’ constitutional rights. The Justice Department under Obama opened 25 investigations into law enforcement agencies. A high-profile investigation involved the police department in Ferguson, Mo., the St. Louis suburb where 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by a white police officer in August 2014. The Justice Department identified a pattern or practice of unlawful stops and arrests; violations of the right to observe and record police activity; excessive force; and discriminatory policing. As a result, the city of Ferguson and the Justice Department entered into a court-enforced consent decree, a negotiated agreement overseen by an independent monitor that details specific remedies the department had to implement. PolitiFact asked the Justice Department for the number of police pattern-or-practice investigations opened by the Trump administration. We did not get a response. We reviewed press releases issued by the Justice Department since 2017 and did not find announcements of investigations initiated by the Trump administration. But we found April 2018 news reporting and a statement from the city of Springfield, Mass., about a new federal investigation into the narcotics unit of its police department, to examine whether the unit engaged in a pattern or practice of using excessive force. ""The DOJ since Trump’s election has largely stopped conducting formal investigations, issuing findings letters, or negotiating consent decrees (or memorandums of understanding) related to local police misconduct,"" said Stephen Rushin, an associate professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law. The Springfield investigation ""appears to be an outlier,"" he said. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found in November 2019 that enforcement actions against law enforcement agencies decreased from eight resolved cases in fiscal year 2016 to three in 2018. Trump’s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, told U.S. attorneys and department leaders in March 2017 that it was not the federal government’s responsibility to manage non-federal law enforcement. ""The misdeeds of individual bad actors should not impugn or undermine the legitimate and honorable work that law enforcement officers and agencies perform in keeping American communities safe,"" Sessions said in a memo. He ordered a review of all department activities, including investigations and existing or draft consent decrees. At his Senate confirmation hearing and throughout his tenure as attorney general, Sessions argued that consent decrees got in the way of day-to-day operations of police departments and that their provisions could hurt police and make cities less safe. ""We will not sign consent decrees for political expediency that will cost more lives by handcuffing the police instead of the criminals,"" Sessions said in an April 2017 USA Today op-ed. Criminal-justice experts told PolitiFact that the Justice Department under Trump tried to retreat from consent decrees negotiated before Trump took office, including one with the Baltimore Police Department after investigators determined that the department engaged in a pattern of discriminatory and unconstitutional policing. Trump administration attorneys general ""have made it clear"" that the Justice Department wants no new consent decrees ""and does not support any efforts that would ‘undermine’ or ‘interfere with’ police departments,"" said David A. Harris, a Sally Ann Semenko Endowed Chair and law professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Harris said the Obama administration did pattern-or-practice investigations of discrimination by police departments and ""Donald Trump came in with Jeff Sessions and undid those."" Pattern-or-practice investigations into police departments were supported by the Obama administration and disfavored by the Trump administration. Obama’s administration initiated at least 25 investigations into law enforcement agencies. The Justice Department did not tell PolitiFact how many investigations it’s initiated under Trump, but our review of publicly available information showed there may have been one. Harris’ statement is accurate but needs clarification, we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2020/jun/04/kamala-harris/fact-checking-kamala-harris-claim-about-trump-and-/

TikTok video misleads on police shooting data
","Nestled among dances on the video-sharing app TikTok are videos about Black Lives Matter demonstrations and police violence. Sometimes the posts don’t tell the full story. In a May 29 video, one user plays a song called ""America"" as he points to a database on Statista, an online portal for statistics. The numbers show that between 2017 and 2020, more white Americans were shot and killed by police than Black Americans. ""Race isn’t the issue!"" the TikToker wrote in the caption. ""Police are not racist! Left wing news just make it seem that way. They need our support not hate."" (Screenshot from TikTok) While the numbers cited in the TikTok video check out, they lack context about how Black Americans are disproportionately killed by police. The numbers published by Statista come from the Washington Post’s database of police shootings around the country. It shows that, since 2015, nearly twice as many white people have been shot and killed by police than Black people. However, the data comes with a big caveat: Black Americans are killed at a higher rate than white Americans. ""They account for less than 13 percent of the U.S. population, but are killed by police at more than twice the rate of white Americans,"" the Post reported. ""Hispanic Americans are also killed by police at a disproportionate rate."" Since May 25, more than 350 American cities have seen demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after a white officer kneeled on his neck. Floyd was the latest in a long line of Black men who have died in police custody. Some federal agencies, such as the FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, keep track of fatal shootings by police. But those officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete, in part because it relies on voluntary reporting from police departments.

No, Joe Biden’s campaign didn’t donate $20 million to bail out protesters
","Former vice president Joe Biden has spoken out against violence incited during demonstrations following the death of George Floyd, and his official policy platform calls for doing away with cash bail. But there is no evidence that his presidential campaign donated $20 million to bail out protesters. A post on Facebook that is critical of both the demonstrators and Democrats claims otherwise: ""Joe Biden campaign has donated 20 million dollars to bail out rioters what the hell does that tell you about the democrats."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  It’s not accurate. First, not everyone who has been arrested during protests could fairly be described as ""rioters."" Those arrested have included curfew violators, working press and others. Next, several campaign staff members did donate their own money to a Minnesota nonprofit that pays the bail for low-income individuals. But the campaign itself did not donate the money and there is no evidence for the $20 million figure. President Donald Trump said that Biden campaign staff members donating money for protesters’ bail are ""working to get the Anarchists out of jail."" When we posed the question to the Biden campaign, a campaign official cited the candidate’s public anti-violence statements and his official platform that calls for eliminating cash bail. But there is no evidence the campaign itself donated $20 million. ""Several of our staff members exercised their First Amendment right to donate to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, on an individual basis,"" a Biden campaign official told us. ""Vice President Biden supports the elimination of cash bail."" About 13 Biden campaign staff members posted on Twitter that they made donations to the fund, Reuters reported, with one posting an image of a $50 receipt.  The Minnesota Freedom Fund is a nonprofit that opposes the practice of cash bail and uses donations to pay bail ""for low-income individuals who cannot otherwise afford it,"" the organization says on its website. ""People of color and immigrants face higher rates of arrest, harsher sentencing, and disparities in the setting of bail compared to white citizens. We pay bail as a way to reduce harm to individuals in the immediate term. But we never lose sight of our mission to abolish cash bail and have the burden of proof for pretrial risk fall on prosecutors, not the accused."" In an effort to find out where the $20 million figure might have originated, we found a May 30 Forbes report that said the Minnesota Freedom Fund raised about $20 million — in total from all donors — over four days following George Floyd’s death in police custody.  The Minnesota Freedom Fund told PolitiFact that no one donor has contributed $20 million.  ""We have had over $30 million in donations since the police murder of George Floyd, from over 900,000 donors, with an average donation of about $30,"" a spokesperson wrote in a June 3 email. ""No one donor nor one small group of donors donated $20 million."" The fund is no longer soliciting donations and is encouraging people to donate to Floyd’s family and other local organizations run by black community members. A Facebook post says that Biden’s campaign donated $20 million to bail ""rioters"" out of jail. The campaign says individual staff members, not the campaign, donated money to the Minnesota Freedom Fund. There is no evidence that totaled to $20 million, however.

 PAC: Austin plans to cut 27-plus car travel lanes to make way for buses, bikes
","Advocates of a $720 million transportation bond proposal on Austin’s November 2016 ballot say the proposed spending will ultimately relieve traffic congestion all over. Yet a group opposing Proposition 1 warned that the plans touted by Austin Mayor Steve Adler entail handing over 27 miles of existing car lanes to buses and bicycles. An ad from the Sensible Transportation Solutions for Austin PAC in the Oct. 23, 2016 Austin American-Statesman had this statement: ""The mayor has promised that passage of this proposition will ensure a decrease in traffic congestion. How will the mayor’s removing 27+ miles of traffic lanes around the city and replacing them with lanes dedicated to usage by bicycles and lots of increasingly empty buses help ease congestion?"" We wondered if all those lane removals are penciled in to make way for buses and bikes. Travel lanes on stretches of major roads would be wiped out, we found, though more than half the reductions would  make way for raised medians and turn bays—not buses—and, with the exception of part of Guadalupe at 24th Street, no lane removals are planned just to carve space for bikes. Also, the group didn't take into account car lanes that would be added with bond funding. Group cites citizen’s research By phone, Michael Levy, the PAC’s treasurer, told us he drew the count of 27-plus lost miles of traffic lanes from research by Roger Falk of the Travis County Taxpayers Association that focused on major city byways that would be affected by $482 million in the bond intended to reconfigure parts of nine ""smart corridors."" The smart corridors: North Lamar Boulevard from U.S. 183 to Howard Lane; South Lamar from Riverside Drive to Ben White Boulevard; Burnet Road from Koenig Lane to MoPac Boulevard; Airport Boulevard from U.S. 183 to North Lamar; East Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard from U.S. 183 to Decker Lane; East Riverside from Interstate 35 to Texas 71; Guadalupe Street from MLK to West 29th; and unspecified sections of William Cannon Drive and Slaughter Lane. A note: Not all the identified changes would happen right off. According to an Oct. 23, 2016, Statesman Q&A, city studies aren’t even complete for two of the corridors and the $482 million would cover only a quarter to a third of the corridor projects’ total estimated $1.56 billion-plus price tag. Another aspect: At least 14 travel lane miles would be funded by $101 million of the proposed bond spending limited to local street improvements, according to an Oct. 1, 2016, Statesman news story. Projects in this category, the story said, include three miles on Parmer Lane and congested roads in west and northwest Austin. PAC’s backup To our inquiry, Falk emailed a document showing what he said he calculated based on city-posted smart corridor studies. All told, Falk’s document indicates that one to two lanes on portions of seven major roads would no longer be available to car traffic, for a total 32.1 ""vehicle lane miles removed."" Some 4.4 lane miles would be ""returned"" in spots, the document says, leaving a net loss of 27.7 lane miles. The document doesn’t talk about removed lanes becoming bus or bike lanes nor does it take note of the car travel lanes that would be added outside the smart corridors, which wasn't considered in the PAC's count of lost lanes, Levy acknowledged by phone. City and newspaper analyses After we shared Falk’s document with city officials, mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford said by phone the city’s corridor plans actually show only 4.4 lane-miles of traffic lanes that would definitely give way to bus lanes--specifically, a lane in each direction on a 1.2-mile stretch of Guadalupe near the University of Texas and a lane in each direction on a one-mile portion of East Riverside Drive. Meantime, Jim Wick of Move Austin Forward, a pro-proposition group, called to say Stanford had told him about our inquiry into the lanes-lost claim. By email, Wick said that by his calculation, city plans to replace two-way center turn (or chicken) lanes along parts of multiple corridors would lead to 14.8 lane miles getting replaced with raised medians. Wick said that another nine miles of the two-way center turn lanes on corridors have either already been taken up by medians or stand to be converted, under city plans, to left-turn ""turning bays."" Stanford and Wick each said city plans don’t call for any traffic lanes to be replaced by bikeways. Separately, Falk said by email he wasn’t aware of any lane removals specifically planned to make space for bike paths. On the other hand, the Oct. 1, 2016, Statesman story mentioned travel lanes potentially becoming bikeways under the city plans, the rationale being that bond-connected losses of travel lanes in each direction on a stretch of East Riverside Drive would partly be explained by the corridor plan’s call for new bike lanes on top of new parking, wider sidewalks and bus-only lanes on the street. Also, some new bus lanes would be open to bikes too. The story mentioned the addition of 14 miles of travel lanes that would be funded outside of smart corridors and said that roughly 15 lane-miles would be lost to through traffic in other spots, most of that to make way for buses. Under city plans, the story specified: --Three miles of East Riverside Drive would see one travel lane in each direction replaced by a bus-only lane while a 3.3-mile portion of South Lamar would see one lane become bus-only during rush hours and a lane in each direction on a one-mile part of Guadalupe would be replaced by bus-only lanes--which adds up to 14.6 lane miles. --Some 20 center or chicken lane miles would be replaced by medians: 3.3 miles on South Lamar, 5 miles on North Lamar, 6.5 miles on Airport and 5 miles on Burnet. By the newspaper’s analysis, then, it looks like city plans call for up to 35 lane miles to be removed with more than half the removals (20 lane miles) making way for medians and the rest yielding space for buses only--including part of South Lamar having dedicated bus lanes during rush hours. Stanford told us the newspaper's future bus-lane count ran high in that the rush-hour bus lanes on part of South Lamar are only to take effect ""when supported by ridership,"" as the South Lamar corridor plan states. Too, Stanford said, the story overcounted total traffic lane removals because the city intends to skip recommended short-term improvements on North Lamar between Parmer Lane and Howard Lane (about a one-mile stretch, we calculated using Google maps) that would eliminate a travel lane in each direction by putting in a center-turn lane. Instead, Stanford said, the city plans to leap to long-term improvements leaving in place two travel lanes in each direction and adding a raised median and separate bike tracks, per the North Lamar/Burnet corridor plan. University of Texas expert For another perspective, we asked Chandra Bhat, director of the University of Texas Center for Transportation Research, to assess the lanes-lost claim. Bhat told us that he reviewed some of the city corridor plans before concluding that the expected removal of center/chicken lanes will make way for medians and turning bays--not lanes for buses or bikes. Otherwise, Bhat said, there are stretches such as part of Guadalupe for which the corridor plan indicates auto travel lanes becoming bus lanes. Bhat estimated such conversions could remove up to three-to-eight existing travel lane-miles in total, depending on engineering decisions. Asked to assess the PAC’s full claim, Bhat said: ""From all that I can see, I don’t see how they could come up with that magnitude of reduction in auto lane mileage."" Levy: ‘Hyperbole?’ Levy in a follow-up interview stressed by phone that motorists stand to lose more than 27 miles of travel lanes, plus or minus a couple, even if they’re not mostly set to give way to buses or bikes. He said a future ad would specify the major streets likely to lose those lane miles. ""Was there hyperbole in the bike and bus"" lane mentions in the ad, Levy said. ""I was writing real fast."" Our ruling The PAC said transportation plans linked to Proposition 1 on Austin's ballot remove ""27+ miles of traffic lanes around the city,"" replacing ""them with lanes dedicated to usage by bicycles"" and buses. About that many car travel lane miles stand to go away if the bond proposition passes. However, 20 removed lane miles would be converted from center-turn lanes to raised medians and turning bays—not bus lanes. Also unsaid: The bond proposal would support the addition of at least 14 lane miles open to car traffic outside the city's smart corridors. We rate the claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. CORRECTION, 3:25 p.m., Oct. 27, 2016: After this fact check posted, Levy said we'd overlooked portions of city plans converting pieces of existing car travel lanes to make way for bicycles.

Top North Carolina economic official says HB2 has not harmed the state economy
","The top economic official in Gov. Pat McCrory’s administration said North Carolina’s controversial ""bathroom bill"" has done nothing to the state economy. Commerce Secretary John Skvarla said in a speech Monday that as far as North Carolina’s economic health is concerned, House Bill 2 ""hasn’t moved the needle one iota."" He went on to say that publicity over the law does not match its actual impact. The word ""iota"" that Skvarla used is defined as ""a very small amount"" or ""an infinitesimal amount."" So clearly Skvarla is confident the law has had basically zero effect on the state economy. We previously rated a claim that HB2 had cost North Carolina $500 million as False. The downfall of that claim was it cited a study that said North Carolina might lose more than $500 million, not that it already had. At the time we found a more accurate estimate of losses was between $77 million and $201 million. Since then hits have continued to come, including more job losses and the NBA, NCAA and ACC pulling postseason games out of North Carolina. Yet at the same time, North Carolina has a large population and economy. Could it be true that the losses haven’t really left a mark? Arguments on his side North Carolina’s GDP is around $510 billion. So even a $500 million loss would only represent 0.1 percent of that. And even after HB2 passed and the backlash became apparent, CNBC rated North Carolina the fifth-best state for business. And the trade publication Site Selection Magazine ranked North Carolina and Texas as tied for the title of ""most competitive state."" The magazine interviewed Skvarla, including a question about HB2. Skvarla responded he believes concerned business leaders are simply misinformed (if so, they can read our fact-checks on HB2 here), and that his office tries to remind them of the many successful companies in North Carolina. He also mentions the state’s educated populace. ""The key factor often comes down to North Carolina’s talented and skilled workers,"" Skvarla said. But is that the whole story? HB2 and jobs No major companies have said they came to North Carolina because of HB2, so it certainly hasn’t helped on that front. And several have announced they stopped planned growth out of protest. The two most prominent were PayPal and Deutsche Bank, which canceled 400 new jobs in Charlotte and 250 new jobs in Cary, respectively. Given the average salaries they had promised, those jobs would’ve paid workers in those two cities nearly $42 million every year. That’s nothing to scoff at, even if the jobs themselves would not have had much of an impact on the two cities’ unemployment rates. Kim Genardo, a spokeswoman for Skvarla, said the losses have been more than offset by other companies announcing jobs since then. ""In one fell swoop the CSX announcement this summer in Edgecombe County is more than triple that (PayPal) jobs number,"" she said. That’s a possibility. The train company itself will only employ 150 people when it opens a new shipping hub in 2020, but the company said it thinks it will lead to the creation of about 1,500 jobs elsewhere in the state. The state plans to pay CSX $122.1 million in incentives. Yet on the same day Skvarla made his claim about HB2, real estate analytics firm CoStar Group announced it would bring 730 jobs to Richmond, Virginia – with an estimated economic impact of $250 million. David Dorsch, a Charlotte real estate broker who had worked with the company, told the Charlotte Business Journal that CoStar had been leaning toward Charlotte. ""The primary reason they chose Richmond over Charlotte was HB2,"" he was quoted as saying. The PayPal, Deutsche Bank and CoStar losses add up to nearly 1,400 jobs. And the chambers of commerce in Raleigh and Asheville blame HB2 for losing an additional 1,500 jobs from unnamed companies. Losses below the radar Other companies skip North Carolina without an announcement, said consultant Dennis Donovan. He’s a partner with Wadley Donovan Gutshaw Consulting in New Jersey, which helps businesses pick new locations. Donovan called Skvarla’s claim ""patently false."" A finance company and a manufacturing company he works with have decided not to consider North Carolina because of HB2, Donovan said – ""and we're a small sample size, so you’ve got to imagine there are many companies out there feeling the same."" Donovan said personal beliefs don’t matter: If a company thinks being in North Carolina will hurt its brand, or its ability to hire and keep the best employees, it’s an easy business decision to go elsewhere. Sports losses Beyond the job losses are the state’s lost tourism dollars. We can’t account for individuals moving their vacations due to HB2, but we do know about major events that were cancelled. Four of the state’s seven largest cities’ chambers of commerce – Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham and Cary – have come out against the the law. Lost conferences and concerts harmed all of them, as did sporting events. Charlotte estimates it lost $100 million when the NBA moved its All Star Game, and $30 million from the loss of the ACC football championship. Greensboro estimated it lost $15 million from various NCAA games, and Cary has said it already lost $2 million and will likely lose millions more since the NCAA is currently deciding where to put games through the 2021-22 season. Our ruling North Carolina has undeniably lost money and jobs due to HB2, so Skvarla’s claim that the law ""hasn’t moved the needle one iota"" on the economy seems incorrect at first glance. On a macro scale, however, Skvarla has a point. Even hundreds of millions of dollars in losses won’t dent the state’s GDP very much. And the now-canceled jobs would not have had much of an impact on the overall unemployment rate. Yet many local economies – particularly in Wake and Mecklenburg counties, the state’s two largest – have felt the sting of hundreds of jobs lost, that would have provided tens of millions of dollars in annual wages. That would have helped the economy. So would the tens of thousands of sports fans who will now spend their money in other states. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/acbcb55c-e49d-46b0-9ce7-5627c28b56c6",/factchecks/2016/oct/28/john-skvarla/top-north-carolina-economic-official-says-hb2-has-/

DCCC makes False claim about Denham's role in Trump hotel deal
","A new TV ad by a Democratic campaign committee describes Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Turlock, as Donald Trump’s ‘Man in Washington DC.’ It says Denham was deeply involved in the GOP nominee’s development of Trump International Hotel in DC. Trump took time away from the campaign trail this week to celebrate the hotel’s opening. ""When Trump wanted to turn a taxpayer-owned building into an $800 a night hotel, Denham helped broker the deal and bragged about it,"" the ad by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says. Denham is locked in a close race against Democratic challenger Michael Eggman for the 10th Congressional District seat in the Central Valley. Eggman and the DCCC have tried to tie Denham to Trump through several campaign ads in recent months. We wanted to know whether this eye-opening claim that Denham ""helped broker"" the hotel deal for Trump was true. We set out on a fact check. Our research Denham has long pushed for the sale and redevelopment of excess government properties. As chairman of the House subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management in 2011, Denham held a committee meeting in the Old Post Office. The partially vacant federal building about three blocks from the White House was costing taxpayers $6.5 million in upkeep at the time. He advocated for redeveloping that site, as well as others, to save taxpayers money. Trump’s development company, the Trump Organization, was selected about a year later to turn the property into a 250-room luxury hotel while preserving its historic nature. This is the ‘taxpayer owned building’ the ad refers to. To say, however, that Denham ""helped broker the deal"" is a far stretch. The Obama Administration’s General Services Administration handled the bids and selection process. GSA received 10 bids and described its process this way in February 2012: ""After closely evaluating the submissions, GSA determined the Trump Organization proposal represented the strongest development team, best long term potential for the local community, and most consistent stream of revenue for the Federal Government."" Dan Tagherlini, then-acting administrator of the General Services Administration, praised the 60-year Trump lease in 2013, as one that will ""save millions of taxpayer dollars while restoring a unique and important historic asset,"" according to a McClatchyDC.com news article. Asked for evidence to back up the claims in the ad, a DCCC spokeswoman said it used news articles from Turlock City News and Time magazine along with a 2013 press release from Denham’s office. None of those, however, show Denham helped ""broker"" the deal. Denham’s campaign spokesman said the congressman ""was not involved in the selection process"" of the property’s developer. A GSA spokeswoman said Denham ""did not vote on any legislation or make a recommendation related to the selection of the Trump Organization as the preferred developer for Old Post Office project."" Denham told the Modesto Bee in August he supports Trump for president. We asked his campaign spokesman this week whether Denham continues to support the Republican nominee, and have yet to hear back.  In this 2013 photo, Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Calif., testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington. AP Photo/Evan Vucci Bragged about it? Denham’s news release does show the congressman was pleased. It says Denham joined Trump Sept. 12, 2013 at the architectural and design unveiling of what’s now called Trump International Hotel. ""I am pleased to see Trump International Hotel’s design unveiled today,"" Denham said in the release. ""This is one of the projects that has been important to me in my efforts to generate economic growth and streamline federal processes, and as the chairman of the Economic Development subcommittee last Congress, I worked closely with the GSA on this project."" $800 a night? The Time article shows rooms at the hotel were originally priced at $800 or more per night. Yet, the same article said ""Rates will go down after the soft opening period, starting at about $472 a night. There were several rooms available early this week, with nightly rates from $588 to $668, not including local taxes, according to the hotel’s website. Our rating A TV ad by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says Rep. Jeff Denham of California ""helped broker"" a deal for a Washington DC hotel for Donald Trump ""and bragged about it."" In reality, Denham chaired a House committee that sought to sell or redevelop excess and underused federal properties, including the Old Post Office Trump later turned into a luxury hotel. While the congressman played a role the overall process, a federal agency under the Obama Administration, not Denham, selected the Trump Organization to redevelop the property after reviewing competing bids. Denham joined Trump at the hotel’s design unveiling in 2013 and said in a press release he was pleased the property was being redeveloped. But there’s no indication, and no evidence from the DCCC, that Denham had any direct role in choosing Trump as the developer. The DCCC advertisement greatly exaggerates Denham’s role in the process and falsely describes him as helping ""broker"" the deal. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Did a Wisconsin election clerk block early voting because of 'partisan bias' against Democrats?
","When The Nation revealed what it described as a Republican effort to suppress voting in Green Bay, news outlets around Wisconsin and across the country quickly responded with their own versions of the story. The article from The Nation, a magazine that describes itself as the flagship of the political left, called out the Green Bay city clerk for being opposed to opening a special early voting site at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. Featured was an email in which the clerk, who is responsible for administering elections, expressed concern about giving an advantage to Democrats. A group called Our Democracy 2020 responded to the article the next day, Oct. 26, 2016, with a news release that made this charge: ""To refuse to allow early voting on the UW-Green Bay campus because the clerk was afraid it would help Democrats not only shows outrageous partisan bias, it also interferes with the exercise of our most basic right."" The clerk did express fear that opening a satellite location for early voting on campus would help Democrats. But in rejecting the campus site -- which would have been the only satellite location in the city -- was the clerk trying to avoid giving an unfair advantage to any political party, as election clerks by state law are supposed to do? Or was she showing ""outrageous partisan bias?"" The group and the backstory This is the first time we’ve checked Our Democracy 2020, a Madison-based coalition that formed in January 2015. The group, whose members include Common Cause Wisconsin and an affiliate of One Wisconsin Now, says its priorities include seeking changes in voting rights by the year 2020. The early voting at issue here is more formally known as in-person absentee voting -- that is, casting a ballot in person before election day. In July 2016, in a lawsuit involving One Wisconsin Now, a federal judge struck down limits on early voting that were approved by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and GOP lawmakers. As a result, cities were allowed to offer early voting in more locations, not just at City Hall. Milwaukee and Madison added satellite locations, but so far, Green Bay and most other communities in Wisconsin have not. (On election day, you must vote at the designated polling place near your home. But early in-person voting can be done at any location in your city that offers it.) The Green Bay situation The email featured in The Nation’s article, as well as related emails, were provided to the magazine by the One Wisconsin Now affiliate, which the article said obtained the emails through a public records request. The liberal advocacy group later provided the emails to us. They show that on Aug. 23, 2016, in the weeks after the court ruling, state Rep. Eric Genrich, D-Green Bay, began asking Green Bay City Clerk Kris Teske what her plan was regarding Green Bay offering early voting. He said he would like to see the city offer multiple satellite locations; UW-Green Bay was not mentioned. Teske said in her first reply: ""I’m very reluctant to have a satellite location for (ballot) security purposes and it is not budgeted for."" Two days later, more emails were exchanged. Teske told Genrich the city would offer early voting at her office, leading Genrich to ask her again about multiple satellite locations. Teske replied: ""I don’t know what else there is to discuss,"" she began, reiterating that she lacks staff and money for satellite voting, and adding: ""There is no reason why anyone can’t either vote in our office, ask for an absentee ballot to be mailed to them, or vote on election day."" Genrich persisted, asking for a meeting with Teske, and he evidently somehow conveyed to Teske that he wanted satellite voting at UW-Green Bay. (Long lines at the UW-Green Bay polling site for Wisconsin’s April 2016 primary election were cited as one reason for opening an early voting site on the campus.) Teske's reply, in the email featured in The Nation article, was sent the next day, Aug. 26, 2016, to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission. It read: I have a state representative who is being very persistent about having an alternate polling location at UWGB. I don’t like the idea at all for many reasons: Staffing, ballot security, budget, etc. He is on the ballot for 25 of our wards. I was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party. UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on election day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the Democrats and he is a Democrat. I have spoken with our (mayoral) chief of staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn't going to happen. A response came two weeks later, on Sept. 9, 2016, from Nathan Judnic, legal counsel for the Wisconsin Election Commission. He wrote that budget and ballot-security concerns are legitimate reasons for not offering satellite locations. But he also told Teske that if the UW-Green Bay polling site ""is OK for election day, and there is no political advantage then, I’m not sure what the difference is for in-person absentee voting at that same location."" Teske, in turn, told Judnic that if she could open a satellite location, it would not be at UW-Green Bay because the campus is difficult to navigate and therefore students would likely be the only early voters in the city using it. A final note on the partisanship part of the claim regarding Teske: Teske does not show up in a database of donor to state political candidates. She was appointed city clerk by Green Bay Mayor James Schmitt. The mayor’s position is nonpartisan, but Schmitt backed the controversial move by Walker to strip away most collective bargaining rights from most public employees. And in March 2016 he attended a Donald Trump presidential campaign rally in Green Bay. Our rating Our Democracy 2020 says Teske refused to allow early voting on the UW-Green Bay campus because she ""was afraid it would help Democrats,"" showing ""outrageous partisan bias."" Teske did express concern about giving an advantage to Democrats because of her belief that the site would be in area with more voters who support Democrats, and because the site was requested by a Democratic state lawmaker. But Teske also cited other reasons for not supporting the campus site for early voting -- including a lack of funding, a concern for ballot security and a concern for a state law that prohibits offering a satellite site that gives an advantage to any political party. Ultimately, the city decided not to open any satellite sites for early voting for the Nov. 8, 2016 election.

Murphy revisits Rubio's Reagan library line about Social Security, Medicare weakening Americans
","In the second U.S. Senate debate, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy accused U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of wanting to ""dismantle"" Social Security -- a charge Rubio denied in a debate in South Florida -- and offered Rubio's own words as proof. According to Murphy, Rubio ""said Social Security and Medicare have, quote, ‘weakened us as a people.' "" Rubio said that Murphy distorted his words. ""What I said is debt is weakening our country, it absolutely is,"" Rubio replied in the Oct. 26 debate at Broward College. Murphy was referring to a speech Rubio gave at the Ronald Reagan presidential library in 2011. The quote is accurate, but it did not come in a speech arguing for such drastic reforms to Social Security and Medicare as Murphy described. Rubio’s ‘weakened us as a people’ comment During his speech, Rubio said Democrats and Republicans created programs and levels of spending that -- while well intentioned -- were doomed to fail from the start. ""These programs actually weakened us as a people. You see, almost in forever, it was institutions and society that assumed the role of taking care of one another. If someone was sick in your family, you took care of them. If a neighbor met misfortune, you took care of them. You saved for your retirement and your future because you had to. ""We took these things upon ourselves and our communities and our families and our homes and our churches and our synagogues. But all that changed when the government began to assume those responsibilities. All of the sudden, for an increasing number of people in our nation, it was no longer necessary to worry about saving for security because that was the government's job. ... ""The other thing is that we built a government and its programs without any account whatsoever for how we were going to pay for it. There was not thought given into how this was going to be sustained."" A Rubio spokesman pointed us to the section in which Rubio said the programs didn’t take into account future costs. But Rubio did say that such programs ""weakened"" Americans. Rubio has long called for reforming Social Security and Medicare. In Florida, about 21 percent of Florida’s population -- about 3.9 million people -- receive Social Security benefits. About 4 million Floridians use Medicare for health insurance. The programs accounted for 41 percent of federal program expenditures in fiscal year 2015. The programs face long-term financing shortfalls, leading program trustees and federal budget experts to call for action by Congress. Rubio has said that he favors raising the retirement age for people such as himself in their 40s but not for current retirees or those who will retire soon. ""Social Security will go bankrupt, and it will bankrupt the country with it,"" Rubio said at a March presidential debate in Miami. ""So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents."" Does Rubio want to privatize Social Security and turn Medicare into a voucher? Murphy also said that Rubio supported the bill by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to privatize Social Security and turn Medicare into a voucher. Rubio has supported a ""premium support system"" that would give seniors a fixed amount of money to purchase insurance from Medicare or a private provider. That was similar to a plan by Ryan. Rubio voted for the Ryan budgets that included reductions in future Medicare spending. The burden would have fallen on beneficiaries to pay more out of pocket. While Rubio was in the Senate, Ryan’s Path to Prosperity budget resolution introduced in 2011 got rid of all mention of potential privatization, choosing instead to focus on overhauling Medicare and cutting taxes and expenditures.   His resolution punted on Social Security: ""In the event that the Social Security program is not sustainable, the president, in conjunction with the Board of Trustees, must submit a plan for restoring balance to the fund."" This would also require the U.S. House and Senate to provide ideas for potential solutions. While running for president in 2015, Rubio wrote an op-ed on Social Security in which he called for raising the retirement age, reducing growth in benefits for wealthy seniors and making it easier to save money -- but he didn’t call for privatization. In his current race, Rubio’s Social Security plan on his website makes no mention of privatization. Our ruling Murphy said that Rubio ""said Social Security and Medicare have ‘weakened us as a people,' "" he said. In a speech in 2011, Rubio talked about government programs intended to help people and said, ""These programs actually weakened us as a people."" Rubio argued that people no longer had to worry about saving once they viewed it as the government’s job and that the government supplanted the role of families and religious institutions to help people in need. Rubio also expressed concern that that lawmakers lacked foresight as to how to pay for the programs in the future. The caveat here is that the quote is not evidence of Rubio aiming to dismantle these programs.

Patrick Murphy: Marco Rubio voted 98 percent of the time with Koch brothers
","At the second U.S. Senate debate, Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy attacked Republican Sen. Marco Rubio for siding with billionaires Charles and David Koch while he was a U.S. senator. ""We all know he never shows up to work, but when he does he has a 98 percent voting record with the Koch brothers, a right-wing special interest group,"" Murphy said of Rubio Oct. 26 in Davie. Murphy brought up Rubio’s alignment with the Koch brothers at both U.S. Senate debates, so PolitiFact Florida decided to see whether it is true. It turns out the 98 percent figure comes from a scorecard from Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-backed political group. The Koch brothers and Americans for Prosperity  Charles and David Koch are no strangers to politics. They own Koch Industries, one of the largest privately owned corporations in the United States dealing with manufacturing, trading and investments. The Kochs also lead a vast network of political activist groups, including Americans for Prosperity. The duo provided seed funding for Americans for Prosperity, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit political advocacy group that has spent millions on Republicans in Senate races in states like Nevada, Indiana, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Groups like Americans for Prosperity are not required to disclose its donors and can advocate for political issues as long as it’s not their primary activity. The Koch brothers have ties to Rubio as he pursued the Republican presidential nomination and senatorial race. In February, when Rubio was running for president, the Kochs’ top political advisor, Marc Short, joined his campaign as a senior adviser. Later in July, after Rubio dropped out of the presidential race and slid into the Senate race, the Koch Brothers hinted at throwing support behind Marco Rubio, according to the Tampa Bay Times. AFP is one component of Charles and David’s broad network of money in politics. The brothers are set to to spend $750 million on this election cycle throughout their network. A third of that money will go to multiple political groups with AFP included, according to the Washington Post. In September, however, Charles announced he was merging all of the conservative advocacy groups into one entity — Americans For Prosperity. The leaders of three groups — Concerned Veterans for America, the LIBRE Initiative and Generation Opportunity (all Koch backed groups)  — will keep their positions, but the organizations will now be branded under the AFP umbrella. The Koch brothers are not elected officials, so to reach his calculation Murphy is relying on a report card by Americans for Prosperity. The group ranks lawmakers’ floor votes and procedural votes ""for economic freedom"" each session of Congress, which covers a two-year period (AFP does not track procedural votes.). To Americans for Prosperity, ""economic freedom"" entails votes for limited government, cutting taxes and reducing business regulation.   The number of votes AFP analyzes depends on the issues that were brought up while the Senate was in session. For example, in the 2013-14 session, AFP looked at 20 Senate votes and in 2011-12 session AFP looked at 35. Rubio has a lifetime score of 98 percent since taking office in 2011. (For comparison, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson has a lifetime score of 5 percent.) Murphy is accurately referencing the the AFP scorecard, but that record is not a vote-for-vote count. The organization only analyzes a sample of votes that align with the group’s agenda. AFP Florida spokesman Andres Malave told PolitiFact Florida that  the Federal Affairs team works with AFP leadership to choose which votes to score. He added, ""Charles and David Koch do not play a role in developing the AFP scorecard."" Our ruling Murphy said Rubio ""votes 98 percent of the time with the Koch brothers."" Murphy is citing a scorecard given out by AFP, a group funded by the Koch brothers. The duo is clearly involved in this group, but it should be noted that the brothers have not held office, voted or have direct influence over the votes that are analyzed on the AFP scorecard. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Clinton: Undocumented workers pay more than Trump in federal income taxes
","Some undocumented immigrants pay more in federal income taxes than Donald Trump, said Hillary Clinton Oct. 26 at a rally in Tampa, Fla. Less than two weeks before Election Day, the Democratic presidential nominee chastised her opponent for his hardline stance on immigration. ""By the way, one-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump pays,"" she said. Experts told us Clinton’s claim is grounded in educated estimates about undocumented immigrants and knowledge of Trump’s past tax practices. But they’re still just estimates. Undocumented workers There is no official count of undocumented workers who pay federal income taxes. But Clinton’s claim — that half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes — is an educated assumption that many experts use, said Kim Rueben, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. ""As far as we can vet it, it is true,"" Rueben said. For reference, the Tax Policy Center estimates that 56 percent of the entire population pays federal income tax, while 44 percent don’t. Social Security is one way we know undocumented workers pay federal income taxes. The Social Security Administration estimated that in 2009, 3.1 million unauthorized workers paid into Social Security via payroll tax, even though most will not be able to collect those benefits. In addition to Social Security, payroll taxes also withhold federal income taxes from a worker’s paycheck. There’s also the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, which people who are unable to obtain Social Security numbers use to pay income taxes, regardless of immigration status. In 2013, 4.3 million people filed tax returns using ITINs. ITIN filers paid $9 billion in payroll taxes in 2014. Most people with an ITIN are undocumented immigrants, said Ruth Wasem, a public policy professor at the University of Texas. The number of people signing up for ITINs and paying taxes that way has grown over the past few years, particularly because many immigration reform proposals require undocumented immigrants to prove they have been paying taxes in order to qualify for some sort of legal status, Wasem said. Between those who contribute via ITIN, others who have taxes withheld from their paycheck, and any overlap between the two groups, Wasem said Clinton’s claim that half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes is likely a low ball estimate. Donald Trump While experts can make educated guesses about how many undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, there’s still too much we don’t know about Trump’s tax returns to speculate how much he presently pays in federal income taxes. Going against decades of tradition for presidential nominees, Trump has so far refused to release his tax returns. We know there have been at least a few years Trump didn’t pay federal income taxes and that tax write-offs are generally beneficial to real estate developers like Trump. Three pages of Trump’s 1995 tax returns, uncovered and verified by the New York Times, show it’s possible he was able to legally avoid paying federal income tax for as much as 18 years. A tax provision known as net operating loss allows people to report business losses on their personal tax returns as a deduction. So if a person’s reported net operating loss is equal to or larger than their personal income, that person does not have to pay income taxes. Trump’s $916 million loss reported in his 1995 tax return could counteract any income he earned that year and beyond, up to 18 years total under IRS rules in 1995, according to the New York Times. Going back a few more years, a 1981 report by New Jersey gambling regulators analyzed five years of Trump's finances as part of his efforts to get a casino license for a proposed casino-hotel complex. The report says Trump paid federal taxes for three of those five years, 1975-77, but he did not pay federal income tax in 1978 and 1979. So in the years Trump paid zero federal income taxes, undocumented immigrants who paid any federal income taxes presumably would have paid more than him. But Clinton’s claim is phrased in the present. Without Trump’s current tax returns, we simply don’t know what his tax burden is today. So in the most recent tax year, we don’t know who paid more in federal income tax, Trump or an undocumented worker. Our ruling Clinton said, ""One-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump pays."" While there is no official figure, experts estimate that about half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, if not more. So in a year when Trump does not pay federal income taxes, which has been the case in the past, undocumented immigrants who do federal pay income taxes would pay more than him. But Clinton makes it seem as if this is a present state, and we don’t know anything about Trump’s current tax situation because he has not made his tax returns public. For that reason, we have no way of comparing Trump’s federal income tax payments to those of any given undocumented immigrant.

Barney Frank's claim against Bob Dold, Paul Ryan doesn't add up
","The race between Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Dold and Democratic challenger Brad Schneider in Illinois' 10th Congressional District is one of the most expensive House races in the country. It's a race both parties consider winnable and money from national sources is pouring in for support. Schneider was elected to the seat in 2012, but as an incumbent in 2014, lost to Dold by 5,000 votes. That race was the poster child for extremely high spending by national parties on a local race. Schneider’s friends won’t let voters forget it. Former U.S. Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts sent out a fundraising email in September supporting Schneider and criticizing top Republicans for donating to Dold’s campaign. In fact, in his email, Frank calls out one Republican leader by name. ""Paul Ryan’s already spent millions to try and permanently derail Brad’s progressive, energized, campaign."" That made us wonder: Has Ryan really spent millions of dollars to try to ensure Dold would be re-elected? We took a deep look at Super PACs and national committees to get to the bottom of this claim. Why is the 10th District so important?  In a year where Democrats could take back the United States Congress, competitive races are getting attention. Both parties are sending more to incumbent congressional candidates in tight races. In February, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) selected 12 candidates, including Dold, to receive extra money through a funding model called The Patriot Program. The Patriot Program describes itself as an organization that ""plays a vital role in keeping our Republican team on offense and helps build a lasting and productive Republican Majority for the American people."" Schneider, too, is receiving money from national PACs like the Democrats Win Seats PAC set up by former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Contributions to Dold’s campaign  Schneider campaign spokesman Steven Kirsch sent us a list of contributions the NRCC and the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) donated to the effort to oppose Schneider’s campaign during the 2012, 2014 and 2016 elections. Kirsch also included the money Republicans spent to support Dold in 2014 and the current election. We used the Federal Election Commission website and OpenSecrets.com to verify those figures showing the NRCC and CLF have spent roughly $7.6 million in those campaigns. Of that amount, $1.8 million came while Ryan was speaker of the House.   Kirsch explained that because Ryan is the speaker of the House, he is the nominal head of these organizations. Ryan wasn’t elected speaker of the House until October 2015. That means Ryan would not have been in charge of the CLF and NRCC spending in the 2012 and 2014 elections. Kirsch explains: ""While he was not speaker during the cycles where this money was spent, we feel that it is appropriate to use him as a representative of the group as a whole,"" he said.   Did Ryan spend that money?  Ryan serves as an ex-officio member of the NRCC’s executive committee and we found the PACs Team Ryan and Ryan for Congress gave a combined $31.4 million to the NRCC since Oct. 30, 2015, a day after he was elected speaker of the House. But that is only about a third of the total amount the NRCC raised this campaign cycle and there is no indication Ryan dictates how the NRCC spends its money. In fact, the CLF and the NRCC websites do not explain the decisions behind organizational spending strategy. Neither organization returned multiple emails and calls to PolitiFact Illinois. And while Ryan has attended fundraisers for Dold in Illinois and his committees have donated to the NRCC, we could not find any instances where Ryan directly contributed to Dold’s campaign or spent his own money to oppose Schneider. For analysis on this issue, we turned to Paul S. Herrnson, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut and author of several books including The Financiers of Congressional Elections: Investors, Ideologues, and Intimates. Herrnson said looking too far into Frank’s statement might be considered ""splitting hairs,"" but Frank’s characterization of Dold’s funding model is misleading. ""It’s not exactly fair,"" he said. ""It’s not exactly his money. It’s not a direct contribution from Ryan and it’s not a contribution from Ryan’s personal campaign or congressional campaign committee."" Herrnson said Frank’s motive is to paint a negative picture of Dold, saying he relies heavily on outsider money. ""They want people to come away with the idea that this campaign is being directed by a political insider of the opposite party,"" Herrnson said. ""It sort of makes the source of the money an issue."" But he said neither Democrats nor Republicans are immune. They both point fingers and both accept outsider money. ""It happens on both sides of the aisle,"" he said. Our ruling  In a September fundraising email supporting candidate Brad Schneider, former U.S. Congressman Barney Frank said, ""Paul Ryan’s already spent millions to try and permanently derail Brad’s progressive, energized, campaign."" Ryan’s committees, Team Ryan and Ryan for Congress, have donated $31.4 million to the NRCC since he became speaker of the House. As speaker, Ryan does represent the NRCC, which has given $1.8 million to support Dold and oppose Schneider this election cycle.   That's not ""millions,"" but it's not far off. Also, the wording of Frank's statement implies has received a direct contribution from Ryan when the money came from political committees Ryan represents.

Newt Gingrich misleading in saying Bill Clinton paid $850,000 'penalty'
","In a combative cable news interview that has gone viral, Fox News host Megyn Kelly and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- a prominent Donald Trump surrogate -- clashed over allegations that Trump had groped nearly a dozen women over the years. Among other things, Gingrich countered that the husband of Trump’s opponent, former president Bill Clinton, has gotten off light after being involved in sex scandals during the 1980s and 1990s. Here’s an excerpt of the Oct. 25 interview: Gingrich: ""No, I just want to hear you use the words. I want to hear you use the words, ‘Bill Clinton, sexual predator.’ I dare you. Say, ‘Bill Clinton, sexual predator.’ "" Kelly: ""Mr. Speaker, we’ve covered — excuse me, sir …"" Gingrich: ""Disbarred by the … Arkansas bar."" Kelly: ""Excuse me. excuse me."" Gingrich: ""Disbarred by the Arkansas bar; $850,000 penalty."" We wondered about Gingrich’s assertion that Bill Clinton had paid an ""$850,000 penalty."" That was a figure Clinton paid in a settlement over alleged sexual impropriety with Paula Jones, an Arkansas state worker when Clinton was Arkansas governor. Jones sued him over the alleged incident in a case that ultimately led to Clinton’s impeachment battle. We found that not only is Gingrich wrong to call that sum a ""penalty,"" but also that Gingrich is uniquely unsuited to argue that it was in fact a penalty. Let’s explore the details. Is Clinton’s $850,000 payment a ‘penalty’? Clinton did indeed pay Jones $850,000. But the payment in question does not fit the commonly accepted legal definition of a ""penalty,"" legal experts said. Here’s how the Washington Post described the payment in its contemporary coverage in 1998: President Clinton reached an out-of-court settlement with Paula Jones yesterday, agreeing to pay her $850,000 to drop the sexual harassment lawsuit that led to the worst political crisis of his career and only the third presidential impeachment inquiry in American history. After more than 4 1/2 years of scorched-earth legal warfare, Clinton and Jones brought a sudden end to the case with a four-page deal in which he acknowledged no wrongdoing and offered no apology. ... Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's chief attorney in the case, said the president still insists Jones's allegations of a crude proposition in a Little Rock hotel suite seven years ago ""are baseless"" but agreed to make the payment in the interest of finally putting the matter behind him. … The case was dismissed without a trial. So we know a few important things about the $850,000 payment. It came after the trial court had dismissed the case. It was made as part of an out-of-court settlement between Clinton and Jones. And as part of the agreement, Clinton made no acknowledgment of guilt. All of these things undercut the notion that the payment was a penalty, legal experts said. ""A penalty is generally imposed by a governmental entity for a violation of a law, rule or regulation,"" said Brett Kappel, a lawyer who specializes in political ethics law with the firm Akerman. ""Payments to resolve civil suits are treated as compensation for a harmful or wrongful act. They are not a ‘penalty.’ "" Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that ""it’s not accurate to call a settlement a ‘penalty.’ "" Roosevelt said that penalties ""are usually imposed without a party’s consent and on the basis of wrongdoing. ... individuals have no power to impose penalties on other individuals.""    Why Gingrich’s use of the term ‘penalty’ here is ironic As it happens, Gingrich has some experience with parsing the definition of legal penalties -- and not in a way that supports his case against Clinton. In 2012, a Mitt Romney-affiliated Super PAC said that Gingrich, then a Republican primary rival of Romney, had been ""fined $300,000 for ethics violations"" dating back to Gingrich’s tenure in Congress in the 1990s. In January 1997, the House voted to approve a committee’s report demanding that Gingrich pay a sum of $300,000 and admit that he had ""engaged in conduct that did not reflect creditably on the House of Representatives."" (Here’s a timeline of the case.) We initially rated the super PAC’s claim True. However, after publication, one of Gingrich’s ethics lawyers in the case, J. Randolph Evans, demanded that we change our rating. He argued that Gingrich wasn't ""fined"" by the ethics committee but rather had to pay a ""cost assessment."" Given this linguistic technicality, we ended up downgrading our rating, but only from True to Mostly True, since legal experts told us that a ""cost assessment"" was not substantially different than a ""fine."" ""Gingrich’s earlier position does undercut his current one,"" Roosevelt said. We reached out to the Trump campaign, Evans, and Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett but did not receive replies. Our ruling Gingrich said that in the Paula Jones case, Bill Clinton paid an ""$850,000 penalty."" According to legal experts, Clinton’s $850,000 payment does not qualify as a ""penalty."" It wasn’t imposed by a court (the court had dismissed the case); it was negotiated by the parties out of court; and it came with no admission of guilt. Given his past experience with careful parsing of how legal penalties are defined, Gingrich of all people should have known this.

Did U.S. spend $6 trillion in Middle East wars?
","Donald Trump repeated his call to ""drain the swamp,"" knocking the ""failed elites in Washington"" for being wrong about everything from foreign policy to health care. ""The people opposing us are the same people — and think of this — who’ve wasted $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East — we could have rebuilt our country twice — that have produced only more terrorism, more death, and more suffering – imagine if that money had been spent at home,"" Trump said at a Oct. 26 rally in Charlotte, N.C. ""We’ve spent $6 trillion, lost thousands of lives,"" Trump said. ""You could say hundreds of thousands of lives, because look at the other side also."" The United States has listed nearly 7,000 casualties from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. For this fact-check, however, we wanted to focus on Trump’s claim that the United States has spent $6 trillion on the wars. Is that right? What we found is that Trump confused what’s been spent, and what is projected to be spent. That said, he’s right to note the large cost of U.S. intervention in the Middle East. The Congressional Research Service estimated in 2014 that the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (mainly the cost of operations) had cost the United States about $1.6 trillion from 2001 to 2014. Here’s the breakdown: • $686 billion for Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) • $815 billion for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn • $27 billion for Operation Noble Eagle, enhancing security at military bases • $81 billion for programs and activities not directly related to war operations But those figures only include direct expenditures. More comprehensive analyses show trillions of dollars in additional spending. A recent Brown University study, for example, pinned the cost of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria at about $3.6 trillion from 2001 to 2016, using the $1.6 trillion operations costs as a baseline but also accounting for counterterrorism costs. Adding in money appropriated for war spending and on homeland security in 2017, the total reaches $4.79 trillion. This figure also includes future obligations for veterans medical and disability costs ($1 trillion through 2053) as well as interest on borrowing for wars. Here’s a specific breakdown from the study:  A 2013 Harvard University working paper came up with an even higher cost: $4 trillion to $6 trillion for just Iraq and Afghanistan. Like the Brown study, the Harvard paper estimated that future medical care and disability benefits for veterans of these war will near $1 trillion. The Harvard paper also attributes $750 billion in Pentagon medical and personnel costs to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and also considers the cost of nation-building in the two countries. Our ruling Trump said the wars in the Middle East have cost $6 trillion dollars. Trump is citing the high-end estimate of credible analyses of spending associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet he is confusing money that’s been spent with money that researchers say will be spent. That’s a $1 trillion difference or more. Trump’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2016/oct/27/donald-trump/did-us-spend-6-trillion-middle-east-wars/

Group says Sen. Bennet chose Washington 'insiders over our generals' in war on ISIS
","A new ad by a conservative group says U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, ""chose the (Washington) insiders over our generals"" in the battle against the Islamic State. The Restoration PAC ad says when it comes to national security, Bennet chose to ""serve"" the insiders instead of America. ""On ISIS, he chose the insiders over our generals,"" said the ad’s narrator, who then refers to Bennet's Republican opponent. ""Darryl Glenn made choices, too. Unlike Bennet, he'll always put America first,"" the narrator concludes. We asked Restoration PAC for evidence supporting its claim that Bennet ""chose the insiders over our generals"" in the fight against the terrorist group. The PAC supplied news stories and opinion commentaries that mostly criticized President Barack Obama’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq in late 2011. According to a 2014 Washington Times story cited by the PAC, Obama ignored a recommendation by Army General Lloyd J. Austin III to maintain an ongoing force of 23,000 U.S. soldiers to support the Iraqi Army as it assumed full responsibility for the nation's security. Without American military support and advisers, the Iraqi Army floundered, stopped training troops, and soldiers ran from battles as Islamic extremist groups rose up, the Washington Times reported.    However, as PolitiFact has reported, Democrats often blame President George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, because al-Qaida flourished in Iraq after the 2003 overthrow of Saddam Hussein, and the group eventually evolved into Islamic State. And the 2011 troop withdrawal deadline was forged by President Bush's 2008 Status of Forces agreement with then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who -- along with many Iraqis -- increasingly wanted the American military gone. Restoration PAC also cited an August Time magazine story, in which retired generals and unnamed current commanders said the Obama administration has a ""bad strategy"" for destroying Islamic State in Syria and Iraq that includes an ""anemic application of force"" and a lack of a local ground forces to reclaim territory from ISIS. Yet the Time story also states: ""The U.S. is beating ISIS handily, judging by Vietnam’s body-count metric. The total number of ISIS battlefield deaths claimed by U.S. officials has jumped, from 6,000 in January 2015 to 45,000 last month—a bloodbath for an enemy force estimated to number about 30,000.""   What role does Michael Bennet play in any off this? Restoration PAC spokesman Dan Curry pointed to a December 2011 Bennet news release, saying it shows the senator supported Obama’s troop withdrawal from Iraq, which fueled Islamic State’s growth. ""After nine long years, $1 trillion spent and 1 million service members deployed, Americans and Coloradans welcome the responsible end to the war in Iraq,"" Bennet said in the news release. ""Our troops have performed bravely and effectively in Iraq and accomplished everything that was asked of them: securing communities and creating the space for democratic change to take root."" Bennet wasn’t alone in supporting bringing the troops home. At the time Obama announced the withdrawal, three-quarters of Americans approved of it -- yet more than half of Republicans did not. In an earlier statement on the Iraq withdrawal, Bennet stressed that ""serious threats against the United States remain, and we must continue to work to ensure we have the best-trained and best-equipped military in the world,"" Westword magazine reported. ""Whatever Bennet's true motivation, he went along with Obama's plan over the advice of generals who warned pulling out of Iraq would be a disaster and it was,"" Curry said in an email to PolitiFact. The PAC also cites a Bloomberg TV interview days before the 2012 presidential election, where Bennet said: ""I think the president gets enormous credit for promising to end the war in Iraq and ending the war in Iraq, for announcing a deadline on Afghanistan and sticking with that when his opponent is basically taking every position possible. And I think that the people of Colorado think he's a strong foreign policy president."" Yet, Bennet has worked on bipartisan legislation to shield the country from terrorism attacks. He cosponsored the Visa Waiver Program Security Enhancement Act, a December 2015 bill to plug security gaps and prevent terrorists from entering the country. The Visa Waiver Program allows citizens of 38 countries to travel without a visa to the United States for business or tourism for stays of up to 90 days. Key sections of Bennet's bill were passed in December as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2016. Now individuals who have traveled to Syria or Iraq in the past five years are required to acquire a traditional tourist visa instead of traveling to the United States without a visa under the waiver program. This requires them to be interviewed by an American consular official and submit biometric information, such as their fingerprints, so they can be vetted before they’re allowed to enter the United States. ""We have to continue to do everything we can to degrade and destroy ISIS, including increased air strikes targeting their economic infrastructure and oil production. We also need to redouble our efforts to disrupt their recruitment online,"" Bennet told Colorado Public Radio recently. Our ruling Restoration PAC says Bennet ""chose the (Washington) insiders over our generals"" in the battle against Islamic State. The group says President Obama’s withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq fueled the rise of ISIS and blames Bennet for supporting the withdrawal and for generally backing Obama. However, Bennet has advocated for a strong defense against terrorism, passed legislation to prevent potential terrorists from using the Visa Waiver Program to easily enter the United States and backs initiatives to counter extremists from recruiting people online.      It's a big stretch to say that because Bennet supported the withdrawal and welcomed home U.S. troops after a long war, he chose Washington insiders ""over our generals.""

"['Global News Service', 'Food', 'Foodmentum']","
Advocacy group: America, Europeans waste 15 times more food than folks in Africa
","We know we Americans have big issues with our waistlines, but are our issues with wasted food just as large? A recent tweet from FoodMentum, an anti-food waste advocacy website, says we do. ""Europe and US households waste 15 times more food than a person in Africa,"" the Oct. 10, 2016, tweet said. A nice bit of statistical fodder for a fact-check, we thought. FoodMentum’s funder Maria Huszar told us she got the stat from a blog post on Foodtank, a food policy information clearinghouse. The article used slightly different words, but the gist was the same. ""A European or North American consumer wastes 15 times more food than a typical African consumer,"" it said. Huszar acknowledged she swapped consumer for household. She also lumped Canada in with the United States, but our main concern was to check the accuracy of the gap between the two leading industrialized economic regions and Africa. A quick note here on what’s meant by food waste. That term refers to food that gets thrown in the trash, either by retailers -- think supermarkets and restaurants -- or consumers. That’s separate from food loss, which happens at farms, in transport, and at food-processing plants. Those products fall by the wayside due to spoilage or blemishes or wasteful production methods. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization commissioned a benchmark study on both losses and waste in 2011. It concluded that the per-capita food waste by consumers in Europe and North-America is between 95 and 115 kilograms a year. In sub-Saharan Africa and south and southeast Asia, it’s between 6 and 11 kilograms a year. Those numbers might seem clear. but they actually leave plenty of room for uncertainty. You can play with the ratios and get results that vary from more than 15, less than 15 and pretty close to 15. But most important for the claim we’re vetting, this study doesn’t give a clear estimate of food waste for sub-Saharan Africa alone. It gives a range that includes much of Asia.   Vaclav Smil, professor emeritus at the University of Manitoba, Canada, told us there’s good reason to keep the figures vague. Smil, who has written many books and articles on the intersection of food, policy, energy and the environment, said too much data is missing. ""All countries, except Japan, have only approximate, derived, assumed, secondary waste data,"" Smil said. While some work has been done in Europe and the United States, the U.S. Food and Agriculture Organization reported in 2013 that ""there are currently no published studies available related to the exact amount of food waste in developing countries."" Smil said the difference between North America and Europe compared to sub-Saharan Africa could fall anywhere between five and more than 12. All we can say for sure, according to Smil, is that the gap is large. Researcher Brian Lipinski at the World Resources Institute in Washington echoed that point. Lipinski said the more important point is that overall food losses occur very differently. ""In the U.S. and Europe it's mostly on the consumer end,"" he said. ""While in places like Africa, it's much more on the production end due to factors like pests, lack of adequate storage, and lack of infrastructure."" More money = more food waste So why is food waste so much bigger in wealthier countries? As the authors of the 2011 report put it, those ""people simply can afford to waste food."" That waste takes place at many points. Supermarkets throw out fruits and vegetables that lose a bright fresh look. Restaurants serve portions that go beyond what most people can finish. As for what we do at home, a study in the United Kingdom found plenty of habits that make it more likely that food will end up in the trash. The list includes buying too much because we don’t know what we need and throwing out packaged food as soon as it goes past the printed expiration date, when it’s actually still fine to eat. Smil pointed to one telltale problem -- fewer people cook. ""People who do not cook regularly have very poor control of their fridge contents and do a poor job of avoiding preventable losses,"" he said. And he added that even when people do cook, especially single people, they ""engage in little reheating next day."" By the way, Lipinski said his group doesn’t argue that if Americans and Europeans wasted less food it would help the nearly 800 million who don’t get enough around the world. It would save billions of gallons of water and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but that would do nothing to improve harvests and storage in places like sub-Saharan Africa. The advocacy website FoodMentum said that Americans and Europeans waste 15 times as much food as the typical African. The number is on the high end of estimates and there are plenty of gaps in the data. But experts who study this say people in wealthier countries waste much more food than people in poorer ones.

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio: President Obama 'was proposing pinprick strikes' in Syria
","Marco Rubio decried President Barack Obama’s past Syria strategy during the second U.S. Senate debate in Davie, saying Obama had supported small and ineffectual attacks. Debate moderator Patricia Mazzei of the Miami Herald noted during the Oct. 26 event with U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy at Broward College that Rubio voted against airstrikes in Syria, and asked if he favored committing ground troops there. Rubio said he would support a plan if he thought it would work but didn’t think using American soldiers was a good option. He said he voted against Obama’s plan because he had favored helping factions already in Syria over committing to airstrikes. ""He (Obama) was proposing what they called pinprick strikes — basically a symbolic strike to send a message, but not backed up by a clear plan,"" Rubio said, without elaborating on who ""they"" were. Obama did use the term ""pinprick strikes,"" but it was to specifically advocate against what Rubio is attributing to him. Military intervention Rubio’s ""pinprick strikes"" go back to 2013, when Obama was grappling with how to deal with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons attack against civilians. Washington had planned a military response against the Assad regime, but Obama changed his mind on Aug. 31. Instead of acting unilaterally, Obama planned to first ask Congress to authorize an attack. His approach reportedly would have involved surgical missile strikes by Navy destroyers. Obama did use the term ""pinprick"" several times. But every time he did, it was to describe what he wanted the U.S. military to avoid. Obama said it during an interview blitz on Sept. 9. In one example, he told the Today show’s Savannah Guthrie that ""the U.S. does not do pinpricks. Our military is the greatest the world has ever known. And when we take even limited strikes, it has an impact on a country like Syria."" There is no technical term like ""pinprick"" when describing any kind of military intervention, Michael O’Hanlon, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and co-director of the institution’s Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence, told us in a previous fact-check of this Rubio attack. O’Hanlon said that in his experience, when the word is used, ""it is always pejorative."" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on Face the Nation on Sept. 1, 2013, that he wondered whether surgical strikes are ""just a pinprick that somehow Bashar Assad can trumpet that he defeated the United States of America."" The vote mentioned at the debate came on Sept. 4, when Rubio voted against a Senate Foreign Relations Committee resolution allowing Obama to use limited force against Assad’s regime. It passed by a 10-7 vote and was sent to the Senate. The same day, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also used the term during a hearing for the House Foreign Affairs Committee on strategy in Syria. ""The president has said ... this would not be a pinprick. Those were his words. This would be a significant strike that would in fact degrade his capability,"" Hagel said. Secretary of State John Kerry did refer to the planned intervention as an ""unbelievably small, limited kind of effort"" on Sept. 9, but he didn’t call it a ""pinprick."" As support waned in the Senate, Obama asked the Senate majority leader, then Harry Reid, to pull the measure. Obama said on Sept. 10 that the military would not intervene but could in the future. ""As some members of Congress have said, there's no point in simply doing a pinprick strike in Syria,"" Obama said. ""Let me make something clear: The United States military doesn't do pinpricks."" Rubio voted in favor of arming Syrian rebels a year later. Rubio’s campaign pointed out that Obama revisited the term in the November 2016 issue of Vanity Fair when he said there were no easy solutions in Syria. ""The conventional arguments about what could have been done are wrong. The notion that if we had provided some more modest arms to Syrian rebels — that somehow that would have led to Assad’s overthrow more decisively,"" Obama said. ""The notion that if I had taken a pinprick strike when the chemical-weapons issue came out, as opposed to negotiating and getting all those chemical weapons out — that that would have been decisive. All those things I tend to be skeptical about."" It’s not clear if Obama is characterizing his own proposed strike as a ""pinprick,"" or describing a potential attack the way others may have suggested. Even so, it’s still clear that back in 2013, he specifically avoided defining his proposal as any form of ""pinprick."" Our ruling Rubio said Obama ""was proposing pinprick strikes"" for military intervention in Syria. In 2013, Obama did suggest a limited military response — likely airstrikes from Navy ships — after Assad’s chemical weapons attacks on civilians. Obama only used the word ""pinprick"" to describe what he didn’t want the attacks to be, and said repeatedly that the U.S. military isn’t built for small-scale action. And while some officials have used the term, ""pinprick strikes"" aren’t a true military description for any kind of operation.

Americans for Prosperity falsely claims 250 tax increases from Russ Feingold
","Democrat Russ Feingold spent nearly two decades in the U.S. Senate, and is now trying to win back his old seat from Republican Ron Johnson, who ousted Feingold in 2010. A recent campaign ad from Americans for Prosperity claims one theme permeated Feingold’s tenure in Washington — a push for higher taxes. The conservative political advocacy group even puts a precise number on that claim: ""He voted time and again to make life more expensive for families in Wisconsin,"" the narrator says in the ad, released in August. ""Russ voted over 250 times to raise taxes — 250."" The Club for Growth, another conservative group, used the same figure in an ad released Oct. 12, 2016, wording it as ""250 votes for higher taxes."" Did Feingold really cast that many votes to raise taxes? The matter isn’t as straightforward as the nice round number leads viewers to believe. The foundational question is what constitutes a vote to ""raise taxes""? More than half the votes cited in the ad — 150 — came on budget resolutions, which set non-binding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. They are used as blueprints for the budget or in some cases to make a political statement. But PolitiFact has noted repeatedly that it is inaccurate to suggest votes on non-binding budget resolutions are the same as votes on legislation that sets policy. The resolutions often don’t include precise details and don’t on their own raise, lower or even keep taxes the same. ""You’re voting for kind of an overall map and taking multiple votes on that same map, and not directly raising or lowering taxes in a piece of legislation,"" said Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction. Americans for Prosperity contends the votes are a fair addition to the tally. ""Although many of the spending and revenue levels set in budget resolutions require additional legislative action to implement, there are a number of spending and tax policies set by budget resolutions,"" said James Fellinger, a spokesman for the group. ""Budget resolutions enact procedural changes in order to ease the passage of those policies — voting for a budget resolution is plainly supporting the policies it outlines."" The ad’s tally also includes many votes that were actually against tax cuts — not in favor of tax increases. Feingold spokesman Michael Tyler said Feingold campaign counted more than 150 such examples among the votes cited by Americans for Prosperity. It’s not merely a semantic distinction. When PolitiFact Florida fact-checked a nearly identical claim about votes to raise taxes, three federal budget experts generally agreed that a vote against a new tax cut isn’t the same as a vote for a tax increase. Gordon said that element of the ad’s claim ""is probably the worst argument of all of them"" from a fiscal policy perspective. ""The voter reading that is going to believe (Feingold) voted in 250 separate times to raise an individual’s own income tax,"" Gordon said. ""By any standard that sort of accounting is false in terms of what we expect the average voter to take away from the (claim)."" Meanwhile, there is another problem: Though Americans for Prosperity cited 264 separate votes from Feingold, they came on only 65 pieces of legislation. The votes came on amendments that varied widely in content and scope, so each represented a different position. Nevertheless, that counting approach inflates the total. For example, Feingold cast 34 votes on Senate Concurrent Resolution 23 in 2003, which established Congress’ version of the budget for the following year. Each vote took a position on a proposed change of some kind, but should that count as 34 votes or one? ""Counting multiple votes on the same legislation and all of its permutations just serves to pad the number, but in some cases isn’t completely inaccurate, just not telling the full tale,"" Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact Florida in 2012 when it tackled and rated a similar item. Another problem with the 250 tally: some of the votes come on nuanced, multi-part amendments that are not easily categorized. One example is the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, companion legislation to the Affordable Care Act that helped established Obamacare. Feingold cast three votes on March 24, 2010, against amendments that would exempt certain devices from a 2.3 percent tax (in effect, voting to raise a tax). But the amendment would have offset that by lowering the law’s affordability tax exemption for individuals (voting to lower a tax). Despite the offsetting effect, Americans for Prosperity lists it as a tax increase. Our rating Americans for Prosperity says Feingold voted more than 250 times to raise taxes as a U.S. senator, contending any vote in support of a higher tax should be part of that tally. But that number is built on assumptions and simplifications. Though Feingold cast tax-related votes that many times, more than half of those came on non-binding resolutions that took a position in favor of raising taxes but did not raise taxes by themselves. The claim also does not account for the large number of votes that were actually against a tax cut, not in favor of a tax increase. Experts say that’s a big difference. And it doesn’t acknowledge the nuanced nature of the votes themselves or that many votes came on elements of the same legislation.

Facts dispute Donald Trump's claim that donation to FBI spouse linked to Clinton email decision
","Donald Trump has again questioned the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email practices as secretary of state, this time by citing a connection between a Virginia state Senate race and a man who would become the FBI's deputy director. Trump spoke about the latest Clinton controversy during Florida campaign stops in Sanford on Oct. 25 and the night before in Tampa. ""One of the closest people to Hillary Clinton, with longstanding ties to her and husband -- the closest person, I can tell you that … gave more than $675,000 to the campaign of the wife of a top FBI official who oversaw the investigation into Mrs. Clinton's illegal email server,"" Trump said at the Sanford rally. ""In other words, the man who was in charge of the investigation of Hillary Clinton accepted essentially from Hillary Clinton $675,000 that went to his wife."" ""Never happened before. Never happened. Not in this country's history,"" Trump continued. ""This is a disgrace. And she shouldn't be allowed to run for president. She shouldn't be allowed. She's a crook."" Trump’s claim, which suggests a quid pro quo, suffers one from fatal flaw: The timeframe doesn’t add up. At the time of the contribution, the candidate's husband was not directly involved in the FBI probe of Clinton's email server, according to the FBI. The bureau says that by the time he had some oversight role in the Clinton investigation, the election involving his wife had been over for three months. Here are the details. In 2015, Dr. Jill McCabe, a pediatrician, was recruited to run for one of the 40 seats in the Virginia's Republican-controlled Senate by Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who co-chaired Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign and chaired Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful 2008 run for president. According to the Wall Street Journal, which broke the story, McAuliffe and other Virginia Democrats met with McCabe and her husband, Andrew, on March 7, 2015, to urge her to run as part of an effort to take back the Senate. At the time, Andrew McCabe was assistant director of the FBI's field office in Washington and had focused much of his career on terrorism. The FBI released a statement that Andrew McCabe ""consulted with top FBI headquarters and field office ethics officers for guidance, including briefings on the Hatch Act, to prevent against any actual or potential conflict-of-interest, in the event she decided to go forward."" Based on that advice, the FBI said, when Dr. McCabe chose to run, Andrew ""McCabe and FBI lawyers implemented a system of recusal from all FBI investigative matters involving Virginia politics, a process followed for the remainder of her campaign. During the campaign, he played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind."" News that Clinton was using a private email account in violation of federal record-keeping requirements, broke March 2, 2015. McCabe announced her candidacy 10 days later on March 12, 2015. That July, the FBI was called in to begin a criminal investigation into the use of Clinton's private server at her home in New York. And that same month, Andrew McCabe was promoted to associate deputy director, the third in command at the FBI. He moved to FBI headquarters in September. Not surprisingly, both McAuliffe, through his political action committee, and the state Democratic Party, donated to Dr. McCabe's campaign. On Oct. 1, 27 and 29, McAuliffe's PAC, Common Good VA, gave Dr. McCabe's campaign a total of $450,000. (An additional $17,500 had been given earlier). The Democratic Party of Virginia spent $207,788 on Sept. 30 and Oct. 22 for mailings on her behalf. That would amount to 40 percent of the $1.7 million spent by the campaign. Two other Democrats running for Senate seats, Jeremy Pike and Dan Gecker, got larger amounts from McAuliffe's PAC. In November, Dr. McCabe lost her race to incumbent Republican Dick Black. On Feb. 1, 2016, three months after his wife's defeat, Andrew McCabe became the FBI's deputy director. In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, the FBI said it was the first time McCabe had any oversight role over the Clinton case. ""Months after the completion of (his wife's) campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton’s emails,"" according to the FBI statement. But perhaps the biggest flaw in Trump's argument comes with his assertion that McCabe was in charge of the decision on whether to recommend prosecution. It was FBI Director James Comey, not McCabe, who made the decision to recommend that the Justice Department not file charges against Clinton. Comey has repeatedly explained his decision under oath. Finally, there has been no evidence put forth so far — and several people in Trump's campaign did not respond to our inquiry — that Clinton or her campaign were involved in the contributions or knew they were being made. Trump has simply claimed, the money came ""essentially from Hillary Clinton,"" and that ""Hillary knew this money was being paid."" Our ruling Trump said, ""The man who was in charge of the investigation of Hillary Clinton accepted essentially from Hillary Clinton $675,000 that went to his wife."" Trump is correct that hefty donations were given from a Clinton ally to a candidate whose husband was an FBI official. But the timeline doesn’t add up, nor do Trump’s allegations stand up to independent scrutiny. At the time of the contribution, the candidate's husband was not directly involved in the FBI probe of Clinton's email server, according to the FBI. The bureau says that by the time he had some oversight role in the Clinton investigation, the election involving his wife had been over for three months. Meanwhile, the decision not charge Clinton was a recommendation made by the director of the FBI. Trump's statement contains a small element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a completely different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/oct/26/donald-trump/facts-dispute-donald-trumps-claim-donation-fbi-spo/

Clinton said Trump wants to know about allies' payments before defending them
","With two weeks until Election Day, Hillary Clinton used a rally in Florida to undermine Donald Trump’s reputation as a prospective commander-in-chief. Clinton said Trump in a tweet called efforts against terrorists in Mosul ""a total disaster"" and said the United States was ""looking dumb."" ""He's proving once again he is unqualified to be commander in chief of our military,"" Clinton said Oct. 25 in Coconut Creek, Fla. ""Here's another example: He was asked if he would defend our allies. He said well, first he'd want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them."" Has Trump said he would first check who’s making payments before defending them? In media interviews, he has said there’s no obligation to defend them if they don’t pay up. Trump’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment. NATO and unfulfilled ‘obligations’ Clinton is talking about Trump’s comments about NATO during the campaign. NATO, founded after World War II by the United States and 11 other members, now has 28 members, all agreeing to use political and military means to safeguard members’ freedom and security. Article 5 of the Washington Treaty -- NATO’s founding treaty -- says parties agree that an attack against one shall be considered an attack against all, and agree to assist members who are attacked. NATO invoked Article 5 for the first time after the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the United States. To back Clinton’s claim, her campaign directed us to a July 2016 New York Times interview with Trump on foreign policy. Trump was asked about defending small Baltic States that have recently joined NATO against Russia, such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. ""Mr. Trump said that if Russia attacked them, he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing if those nations have 'fulfilled their obligations to us,' "" the New York Times reported. According to a transcript of the interview with the New York Times, Trump also said many NATO members ""aren’t paying their bills."" Reporter David E. Sanger: ""That’s true, but we are treaty-obligated under NATO, forget the bills part."" Trump: ""You can’t forget the bills. They have an obligation to make payments. Many NATO nations are not making payments, are not making what they’re supposed to make. That’s a big thing. You can’t say forget that."" Sanger: ""My point here is, can the members of NATO, including the new members in the Baltics, count on the United States to come to their military aid if they were attacked by Russia? And count on us fulfilling our obligations —"" Trump: ""Have they fulfilled their obligations to us? If they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes."" Reporter Maggie Haberman: ""And if not?"" Trump: ""Well, I’m not saying if not. I’m saying, right now there are many countries that have not fulfilled their obligations to us."" So in that interview, Trump argued other NATO countries had to ""fulfill their obligations"" to receive the United States’ military aid. Asked to clarify what would happen to countries who hadn’t paid, he demurred. In May 2016, Trump also told the Wall Street Journal that when other NATO nations ""don’t pay up, they’ve backed out of their obligations, then we no longer have an obligation to defend them."" Trump said he did not want to get out of NATO, but wanted ""the countries of NATO to pay us."" There’s a problem with the way Trump has talked about NATO country payments. ""No one in NATO actually ‘pays us’ to defend them, as Trump repeatedly claims, nor is there any obligation to do so,"" said Ivo H. Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who previously served as ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama. ""Our commitment to come to our allies' defense -- and theirs to ours -- isn't in return for any payment,"" Daalder said. ""It is an unconditional treaty obligation every ally entered into freely when they signed the North Atlantic Treaty."" NATO allies pay into military and civilian budgets on the basis of agreed cost shares, said Jeff Rathke, senior fellow and deputy director of the Europe Program at Center for Strategic and International Studies. And to be clear, funds are paid to NATO, not to the United States. Beyond the common funding of certain capabilities, each NATO ally is also responsible for spending on its own defense, said Rathke, who served on NATO’s International Staff from 2009 to 2011. Allies are to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, though many are not meeting the guideline. Jorge Benitez, director of NATOSource at the Atlantic Council, says if Trump were elected president and decided not to help defend a NATO ally under attack, ""it would be the end of NATO."" ""This would be a very damaging blow to U.S. national security and would also hurt our alliances in other parts of the world,"" Benitez said. Our ruling Clinton said when Trump was asked if he would defend our allies, ""He said well, first he'd want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them."" Trump has raised questions about other NATO nations not paying their fair share for defense. In a New York Times interview, Trump was asked if he would defend NATO members against an attack by Russia, and he said ""if they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes."" Trump also told the Wall Street Journal that if allies ""don’t pay up, they’ve backed out of their obligations, then we no longer have an obligation to defend them.""

Are VA doctors barred from recommending medical marijuana to veterans?
","The effort to legalize recreational marijuana in Arizona has seen millions of dollars in contributions opposing the initiative -- and political advertisements on both sides of the issue. A recent ad from the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, a pro-pot group, tells the story of a post-9/11 veteran, Bruce Laird, who was prescribed multiple drugs before he turned to medical marijuana to treat his post-traumatic stress disorder. ""VA doctors are prohibited from recommending medical marijuana,"" the Oct. 14 ad’s on-screen text reads, before urging a ""yes"" vote on recreational marijuana to help veterans. As we’ve noted previously, voters approved medical marijuana in November 2010. The first dispensary opened in December 2012. We wondered if the ad’s claim about U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs doctors checked out, especially given the continued delays for health care at the Phoenix VA Health Care System. Cannabis concessions The prohibition is outlined in the VA’s 2011 directive on medical marijuana. ""It is VHA policy to prohibit VA providers from completing forms seeking recommendations or opinions regarding a veteran’s participation in a state marijuana program.""   According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, marijuana is a Schedule I drug, which means it cannot be used for medical purposes and has high potential for abuse. The DEA has a five-schedule drug scale -- the higher the number, the less dangerous. However, 25 states have already legalized medical marijuana.   Dr. Andrew Saxon of the VA Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle said federal health care systems have to obey federal laws. Marijuana is still illegal federally. However, a veteran could still receive VA health care -- as the 2011 directive notes -- and seek medical marijuana elsewhere. ""A military veteran who is eligible for VA health care cannot be refused those services if he/she is using medical marijuana authorized by a non-VA health care provider,"" Saxon said. Legislation on amending the VA’s policy has come up short. Earlier this year, an amendment to the VA’s budget bill would have allowed VA doctors to recommend medical marijuana to veterans in states where it’s legal. However, the amendment was removed from the spending bill, which eventually passed. Our ruling The ad claimed, ""VA doctors are prohibited from recommending medical marijuana."" That’s on the mark. Veterans can still seek medical marijuana on their own -- where it’s legal -- and VA health care. We rate the ad’s claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/265a5a2c-d11f-4e67-b132-57d62130cff1",/factchecks/2016/oct/26/campaign-regulate-marijuana-alcohol/are-va-doctors-barred-recommending-medical-marijua/
