Jim Sullivan says Leah Vukmir wants to allow concealed weapons at day care centers, playgrounds, churches
","
In his 2010 bid for re-election to the Wisconsin state Senate, Jim Sullivan, D-Wauwatosa, is using a slogan that doesn’t even mention his own name.

""Representative Leah Vukmir,"" he says in a series of direct-mail pieces to voters, ""she’s just too extreme.""  

At least five Sullivan mailers label Vukmir too extreme, on everything from health care for senior citizens to state funding for public safety to tracking sex offenders. A recent one focuses on guns, declaring:

""Vukmir supports allowing people to carry concealed weapons into day care centers, churches, health care clinics and playgrounds.""

When paired with an image of a handgun and bullets, and the suggestion there would be no limitations, that’s a pretty strong statement.

Would anyone have been able to carry a gun into all of those places?

As evidence, Sullivan’s campaign points to a series of votes from Vukmir, a Wauwatosa Republican, in the state Assembly.

The Vukmir votes were in support of Senate Bill 403, a measure introduced in 2005 that would have allowed individuals to apply for a license to carry concealed weapons. Applicants would have had to complete a firearms safety course or similar training.  

(At the time, only Wisconsin, Illinois and Nebraska did not have laws allowing concealed carry; today, only Wisconsin and Illinois don’t permit it.)

The bill, after being passed by both houses of the Legislature, was vetoed by Gov. Jim Doyle. The Senate voted to override the veto, but an override vote in the Assembly failed. Vukmir voted for the bill and to override Doyle’s veto.

Let’s look at each of the places Sullivan cites and what the bill said about them:

Churches and health care clinics: The owner or authorized representative of a church or clinic could have given permission to a person who has a concealed carry license to bring a concealed weapon inside.

Day care centers: Concealed carry would have been allowed only for the owner of a day care facility and, for day cares operated out of a home, the residents of the home.

Playgrounds: Concealed carry would have been allowed at parks and playgrounds.

That means of the four places cited by Sullivan, Vukmir supported allowing a limited number of people into three of the them. In some cases, such as a church or health care center, the pastor or operator would have been able to bar concealed weapons from the building. Only with playgrounds would Vukmir have allowed a wider group -- those who completed training and had received a permit.

So let’s take stock.

In a campaign flier, Sullivan says Vukmir, ""supports allowing people to carry concealed weapons"" into day cares, churches and other places. As stated, Sullivan suggests Vukmir wants to allow most anyone to do so. In reality, the bill in question would have been limited to those who obtained permits and -- in three of the four public places described -- applied to a very limited number of people.  That is an important detail left out.

Jim Sullivan says he voted against his own party to “stop runaway government spending”
","
In 2006, Wauwatosa Democrat Jim Sullivan won a Wisconsin state Senate seat long held by Republicans and helped his party take back control of the Senate.

In the 2010 race, Sullivan faces a tough challenge from state Rep. Leah Vukmir, a Wauwatosa Republican. Control of the Senate is again in play.

But Sullivan is running against his own party, declaring in a flier mailed to voters that he ""stood up to his own party by voting against the budget to stop runaway government spending.""

So, is Sullivan a budget-busting maverick?

Let’s quickly break down Sullivan’s claim into two parts, then add some context.

Sullivan ""stood up to his own party by voting against the budget"":

Sullivan’s campaign said the flier’s reference is to the 2009-’11 state budget, which the Senate approved, 17-15, in June 2009. Sullivan was the only Democrat to vote no.

Sullivan’s budget vote was to ""stop runaway government spending"":

Different people may define ""runaway"" spending differently. The $62 billion budget in question raised spending by 6.2 percent over two years and raised taxes and fees by $1.92 billion.

While Sullivan cites a specific vote in his literature, he is making a broader point: that he has worked in Madison to rein in spending. For example, in citing his budget vote in a separate mailer, Sullivan says he ""wants our children to inherit a future free of wasteful government spending.""

So, let’s take a closer look at Sullivan’s record, which in four years includes votes on two budgets and one ""budget repair"" bill. 

We asked Sullivan’s campaign if there were instances, other than his 2009-’11 budget vote, in which Sullivan broke ranks with Democrats in an effort to control spending.

The campaign did not provide any.

Observers noted that, given the Democrats’ three-vote majority in the Senate, Sullivan’s no vote did not affect the party’s ability to get its budget passed.

Mordecai Lee, a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee governmental affairs professor, said the two-year budget bill is the most important vote state lawmakers take. And leaders of the political party in power can exert great pressure on members to ensure that their budget passes.

But Lee, a former Democratic state senator, said he also witnessed cases in which a party would not fight an individual senator’s budget vote against the party, if that senator faced a tough bid for re-election.  

In Madison parlance, it’s called getting a pass.

So let’s review.

Sullivan is telling voters in a campaign mailing that he ""stood up to his own party by voting against the budget to stop runaway government spending."" He was the only Senate Democrat to vote against the 2009-’11 state budget, which raised taxes and spending. But Sullivan’s vote didn’t threaten his party’s effort to pass the budget, he made no attempt to reduce spending in the plan and, on the previous budget and a budget repair bill, he voted with fellow Democrats to raise spending.

Chris Dudley says John Kitzhaber wants a sales tax so people without jobs pay taxes
","
Sometimes, a claim comes along that’s so juicy it makes PolitiFact Oregon salivate.  

This is one: Republican Chris Dudley charges that his opponent in Oregon’s race for governor, Democrat John Kitzhaber, wants a sales tax so people without jobs pay taxes.  He makes the claim in a new television ad, ""Again,"" which has audio and video footage of Kitzhaber from various events, including the Portland City Club in 2000 and a KGW/The Oregonian debate in April. Here’s the full text:
  
Voiceover (VO): Kitzhaber failed Oregon because his answer is always the same. 
John Kitzhaber: I have probably had more tax increases attached to my name -- proposals I oughta say  -- than any other governor.    
VO: Now he’s at it again. 
John Kitzhaber: Obviously, a retail sales tax is one of the options. 
VO: Even worse, Kitzhaber says we need a sales tax so people without jobs pay taxes. 
VO: Taxing the unemployed?  We need jobs, not more taxes. 
VO: John Kitzhaber, even his new ideas are old.  It’s time for a new direction. 
In the ad, the Dudley campaign pulls this from an Oct. 8 Portland Tribune article: 
""Kitzhaber did not hesitate to use the ‘sales tax’ term.... As incomes shrink and the number of jobless remains high, he said, it illustrates more clearly why Oregon needs to stop depending so much on personal income ....""  (Dudley emphasis) 

Squeezing taxes from the unemployed to prop up state spending? How mean!

But take a look at the words from the story left out of the ad: ""Kitzhaber did not hesitate to use the ""sales tax"" term, though he said it’s just one of the options that should be under discussion so the state is not so reliant on income taxes.  As incomes shrink and the number of jobless remains high, he said, it illustrates more clearly why Oregon needs to stop depending so much on personal income taxes to pay for the bulk of its general fund budget."" (our emphasis)

Very sneaky.

Kitzhaber has long advocated for a sales tax to help stabilize Oregon’s roller-coaster reliance on personal and corporate income taxes. The Portland Tribune article clearly shows that Kitzhaber was not advocating a sales tax as a means to get more money out of the out-of-work, but to increase the diversity of Oregon’s tax base. An August 2010 study by The Tax Foundation confirmed Oregon’s heavy reliance on individual income taxes, ranking the state No. 2, just after Maryland.

But before handing down a ruling, PolitiFact Oregon wanted to check out tax burdens in Washington and in Oregon, just to see how a sales tax would affect the poor, which presumably includes many folks out of work. Oregon taxes income -- including unemployment compensation, as does the federal government -- but not sales. Washington does not tax income, but assesses a base 6.5 percent tax on goods. In Seattle, the sales tax is 9.5 percent. 
We found an interesting study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a liberal think tank out of Washington, D.C. Its November 2009 report found that Washington was the most regressive state in the country, where households in the lowest 20 percent spend about 17.3 percent of their income on taxes. In Oregon, the figure for that income group is 8.7 percent. The average among states is 10.9 percent. Clearly, it’s a burden to be poor in Washington. 
Kitzhaber never said anything about implementing a sales tax to make sure the unemployed pay into Oregon’s tax base. We rate this Pants on Fire: The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Kathie Glass says Rick Perry told Houston newspaper he wants a new business tax
","
Libertarian gubernatorial nominee Kathie Glass vowed to cut the state budget in half during an Oct. 19 debate in Austin also featuring Democratic candidate Bill White and Green Party hopeful Deb Shafto.

There was more to her vision of revenue and taxes. ""We need to end property taxes and end (business) franchise taxes,"" Glass said. Then came a revelation: ""In the Sunday Houston Chronicle, Gov. (Rick) Perry said that he wanted another business tax.""

Missed that Perry bombshell? Us too. Far as we can tell, Perry has lately ruled out tax hikes. In an Oct. 15 interview with the Texas Tribune, the governor reaffirmed his intent not to raise taxes to balance the next state budget, adding that he's got a track record of no tax increases--a claim that we're not checking in this article.

So what about Perry calling for another business tax?

Glass's campaign pointed us to a news article on page A-10 of the Oct. 17 Houston Chronicle titled ""Where They Stand,"" subtitled ""the candidates for governor, on the issues."" The article briefs where Perry and White stand on such topics as higher and public education, border security, state spending and economic development. And in the economic development portion, it says Perry claims his policies resulted in jobs being added to Texas and brags that Texas has been hailed as the nation's leading state for business. The next sentence--highlighted by Glass's camp--says Perry cut ""property taxes by $15.5 billion statewide, paid for in part by the adoption of a new business tax.""

Huh. We read that sentence as referring to 2006 legislation encouraged by Perry that resulted in the state picking up a bigger share of public school funding by using state revenues--including money from a major revision of the state's business franchise tax--to cover reductions in local school property tax rates.

We called Glass to to share our read of the Chronicle story. Glass said: ""I just read it differently and I am not willing to give Perry any slack. He should have been there"" at the debate. She was referring to Perry's refusal to join any debate with White unless White released additional tax returns.

Our conclusion is that Glass's statement greatly distorts the Chronicle story which--if Perry had called for a new tax--would have landed on the front page. In fact, we smell smoke. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2010/oct/23/kathie-glass/kathie-glass-says-rick-perry-told-houston-newspape/

Langevin says stimulus program created “thousands of jobs” in Rhode Island
","
Update:
On Oct. 21, 2010, we rated as Barely True a statement by U.S. Rep. James R.  Langevin that the federal stimulus program created thousands of jobs in Rhode Island. We have discovered that we misread a chart  at recovery.gov that showed the number of stimulus jobs created in Rhode Island.

This is a revised story that clarifies the number but does not change the ruling.

With the national and state economies both sagging, the effectiveness of the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the stimulus bill, has been a focus of debate in this year’s congressional elections.

During a debate with Republican Mark Zaccaria on Oct. 14 on WLNE-TV, sponsored by the League of Women Voters, Langevin, a strong supporter of the stimulus program, said it had ""created thousands of jobs here.""

Debating Zaccaria two days later on the WPRI ""Newsmakers"" program, Langevin said:  ""In Rhode Island, there were thousands of jobs that were created""  by the stimulus program.

We wondered: Has the stimulus program created thousands of Rhode Island jobs?

Trying to determine the employment effect of a specific government program can be difficult, but the Recovery Act included specific provisions that required the government to post online information detailing how much money was spent, where it was spent and on what. Included in that is the number of work hours paid for with stimulus money, expressed as the equivalent of a 40-hour-a-week worker.

The current Rhode Island number, posted at Recovery. gov, the federal website with the stimulus spending data, is 1,989.58.

But that’s for the three-month period from April 1 to June 30, 2010, not, as we initially reported, for the duration of the stimulus program, which started in February 2009.

So what’s the real number of new Rhode Island jobs created by the stimulus since February 2009? Laurie Petrone of the state Office of Recovery and Reinvestment, the official who tracks stimulus aid here, said it’s impossible to say.

When the program began, Petrone said, the federal government asked participating state agencies and employers to keep count of new jobs created by the stimulus. The first reporting period was for Feb. 17 to Sept. 30, 2009.

Contractors and agencies were to report the number of full-time and part-time work hours that stimulus money paid for. Those hours were then added up and the total converted into full-time workers.

For those first eight months, Petrone said the statewide jobs number for participating public and private sector employers was 1,960.82. For the next period, Oct. 1, 2009 to the end of 2009, it was 1,900.86.

The reported figure for Jan. 1, 2010 to March 31, 2010, dropped to 530 because many Rhode Island agencies and contractors weren’t able to file timely reports due to the late-March flooding in the state, Petrone said.

Then there’s the 1,989.58 figure for the April 1, to June 30, 2010 period, which is the one on the Recovery,gov website now. Because many stimulus programs are reaching the end of their funding, the quarterly job numbers may start to go down, she said.

Petrone said it’s hard to determine how many new jobs were created and how many preserved because there was no clear definition of what represented a new job.

At the beginning of the program, she said, any work that was paid for in the first eight months was counted in the total. If the job carried over into the next quarter, it  was counted as a stimulus job then as well.

But that means you can’t get a cumulative picture by adding the quarterly reports together, she said, because you would wind up counting carried-over workers twice. Each quarterly report has to be looked at as a ""discrete snapshot"" by itself.

Petrone said that means there is no way to know how many of the 1,900.86 jobs in the second reporting period from Oct 1-Dec. 31, 2009 included workers who would have been laid off but were not, new workers who would not have been hired without the stimulus money, or workers whose existing jobs carried over from the previous period. The same applies to the next two reporting periods.

There  were other problems. Petrone said states and contractors were confused over how to classify new and retained jobs. She gave the example of a state agency that got a stimulus grant and used it for a specific project that added hours to an existing part time worker’s duties.

""Is that a new job, or a saved job, or a retained job?"" Petrone asked. The guidelines were unclear.

In December 2009, in response to confusion and complaints about the reporting process, federal Office of Management and Budget Director Peter R. Orszag told reporting entities to avoid any ""subjective judgment on whether jobs were created or retained"" and just  report hours worked, in the equivalent of full-time jobs, that were financed by Recovery Act funds.

Langevin spokeswoman Joy Fox said the Recovery.gov figures show only part of the program’s effects. It doesn’t count the effect of tax cuts and secondary hiring caused by the increased economic activity the stimulus generated.

She pointed to a July 14 analysis by the president’s Council of Economic advisers, which estimated that, overall, the stimulus program has created or saved 11,000 jobs in Rhode Island.

The council’s report used a broader definition than Langevin did, including jobs saved, not just created.

The council reached its 11,000 figure by estimating that 3.04 million jobs were saved or created nationally by the Recover Act. It then extrapolated jobs numbers for each state.

The council defends its methodology but cautions that the state numbers are ""inherently more speculative and uncertain.""

We can’t determine exactly how many  stimulus jobs were created in Rhode Island. Even Petrone, the state official keeping tabs on stimulus spending, can’t determine that. Nor can Langevin.

The highest quarterly report shows 1,989.58 jobs actually created. It’s close enough to 2,000 to be literally true, but, in our opinion, less than ""thousands"" would imply.

For those reasons, we rate his claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/23/james-langevin/langevin-says-stimulus-program-created-thousands-j/

The health care law forces seniors into Barack Obama's government-run health care plan, says Dan Coats
","
We've fact-checked lots of ads about health care reform and Medicare. But an ad in the Indiana Senate race makes the novel claim that seniors will now be forced into ""Barack Obama's government-run health care program.""

That sounds like a scary prospect -- until you realize that seniors are already in a government-run health care program, Medicare, and have been for 45 years. The law wouldn't force them to join any plan they aren't already in.

The ad is from Dan Coats, a Republican attorney and former ambassador to Germany, who is running for the U.S. Senate in Indiana. He has a wide lead against Democratic Rep. Brad Ellsworth. (The seat is now held by Evan Bayh, who announced earlier this year he would not seek re-election.)

Here's how the ad goes.

""Congressman Brad Ellsworth said he would protect seniors. But when he got to Washington, Congressman Ellsworth voted for the largest cuts in Medicare history - over $500 billion. That's right, Ellsworth voted with Nancy Pelosi to force seniors into Barack Obama's government-run health care program, reducing the protection Medicare provides. That's wrong. Dan Coats will fight to strengthen Medicare and protect seniors.""

We'll start by noting that the ad gets some things right, starting with the fact that Ellsworth voted for the Democratic health care law. And the law does include reductions in future spending for Medicare. But here, we're checking whether the health care law forces seniors into ""Barack Obama's government-run health care program.""

First, some background about how the law handles Medicare.

The $500 billion in cuts is actually a reduction in the future growth of Medicare costs over 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase over that time -- the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. But it won't increase as fast as it would have otherwise. The cost reductions have two aims: to make Medicare more efficient and to help fund coverage for the uninsured.

Some of the savings comes from relatively minor changes, such as $36 billion from increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion from administrative changes. The law directs a new national board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- to identify $15.5 billion in savings, by recommending improved practices while preserving basic coverage. Congress retains the power to overrule the board's recommendations.

More significantly, there's $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program. The program was intended to bring more efficiency from the private sector to the Medicare program, but it hasn't worked as planned. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said that the Advantage programs cost taxpayers an average of 14 percent more than the traditional Medicare plan. President Barack Obama has said repeatedly that Medicare Advantage wastes public money that could be put to better use.

The health care law that Obama signed in March phases out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs over the next three to six years to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare and institutes other rules for the program.

Finally, there's $220 billion in Medicare savings achieved by reducing annual increases in payments health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. The reductions are part of programs intended to improve care and make it more efficient, such as reducing payments for preventable hospital re-admissions. These adjustments are aimed at hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies. There's a good deal of debate as to whether these reductions in payments are reasonable or overly ambitious, and only time will tell which side is right.

But the law also includes new benefits for Medicare. Those improvements include more coverage for prescription drugs, or ""closing the doughnut hole,"" as its commonly known. The law also funds free preventive care for seniors, so that they don't have to pay for routine check-ups. Finally, the law increases payments to primary care physicians who take Medicare patients. Most of these benefits start in 2011.

The ad is nonsensical in two ways. It says that ""Ellsworth voted with Nancy Pelosi to force seniors into Barack Obama's government-run health care program."" But there's no such requirement in the law. Seniors are not ""forced"" into a government plan any more than they have been.

Also, Medicare is already a government-run health care program. It has been for 45 years, ever since President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the law creating it in 1965. Under Medicare, the government pays most of the health care bill for virtually every person over 65 in the United States, even when they see private physicians and visit private hospitals. The government determines what it pays those health care providers, and it sets the rules for what's covered and what's not. Indeed, when liberal supporters of a universal, single-payer health care system make their case, they often describe such a system as ""Medicare for all."" Obama specifically rejected such a plan during the presidential campaign as too dramatic a change from the current system.

The new health care law cannot ""force"" seniors into a government-run health care program to which they already belong. We asked the Coats campaign about this point, and they said Medicare may have already been a government-run health care program, but it wasn't Barack Obama's government-run health care program until the health care law went into effect. That argument doesn't make sense to us because we don't think that a major government program that's been in place for 45 years becomes a new program when a president passes legislation that affects it.

Maybe you could make a case that some people in Medicare Advantage will see their programs changed. But Medicare Advantage programs changed their offerings from year to year before the health care law passed. And if seniors are being forced into regular Medicare, a government-run health care program, it's one they've collectively been forced into for 45 years. Ellsworth's vote did nothing to change that. The ad is capitalizing on confusion about the nature of the Medicare program and making a ridiculous claim.

Barbara Boxer says Carly Fiorina would penalize the elderly to balance the books
","A new ad from California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer takes a broad-brush approach to painting Republican opponent Carly Fiorina as extreme.

""Carly Fiorina, she's against banning assault weapons, and that's reckless and dangerous. She's for risky new oil drilling that could threaten our jobs. Fiorina's plan would mean slashing Social Security and Medicare, which would devastate seniors. And she'd make abortion a crime. No wonder Fiorina is endorsed by Sarah Palin. Carly Fiorina, just too extreme for California.""

The Fiorina campaign blasted the ad. ""We demand that she immediately remove this ad from the airwaves and apologize to Carly, and California voters, for not only this deliberate and blatant distortion of reality, but also for her refusal to have an honest and serious debate about the issues during this crucial time for our nation,"" said campaign manager Marty Wilson in a written statement.

The Boxer campaign said they're standing by the ad. Both campaigns invited us to fact-check it. Here, we wanted to look at whether ""Fiorina's plan would mean slashing Social Security and Medicare, which would devastate seniors.""

To support the claim, the Boxer campaign points to several of Fiorina's public statements in which she said entitlement reform was necessary to rein in government spending. (Technically speaking, entitlements are any kind of government benefit program, but people usually mean Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.)

As we reviewed Fiorina's position on entitlements, we couldn't help but notice one thing: Fiorina isn't terribly specific about what she thinks entitlement reform should include. She does say often that she does not want to cut benefits for current retirees or those nearing retirement.

We should note here that most of the candidates from both parties say that entitlement reform is necessary, and pretty much all say we shouldn't cut benefits for current retirees or those nearing retirement. You might call these generic talking points.

Perhaps the best discussion of Fiorina's specific views on entitlements came in an interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News on Oct. 17, 2010. Wallace asked her several times about how to cut Medicare or Social Security, with Fiorina dodging the questions. The last exchange went like this:

Wallace: ""I'm going to try one last time, and if you don't want to answer it, Ms. Fiorina, you don't have to.""

Fiorina: ""It's not a question of not wanting to answer it.""

Wallace: ""Then let me ask the question, if I may, please. You're not willing to put forward a single benefit -- I'm not even talking about the people that are 60, let alone 65 or 70. I'm talking about people under 55. You're not willing to say there's a single benefit eligibility for Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security that you're willing to say, yeah, I would cut that?""

Fiorina: ""What I think we need to do to engage the American people in a conversation about entitlement reform is to have a bipartisan group of people to come together and put every solution on the table, every alternative on the table. And then we ought to engage in a long conversation with the American people so they understand the choices, instead of rushing off into a closed room and having 100 senators figure it out for themselves. We need to engage the American people in the conversation and I'm willing to consider any alternative. But we cannot continue to just jump over the fact that our government is bloated, wasteful, inefficient, in many cases inept, and frankly, in many cases as well, corrupt.""

We would say that Fiorina doesn't really have a position on cutting entitlements, but the Boxer campaign pointed us to a few comments Fiorina has made praising plans promoted by the conservative think tanks The Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute. The Boxer campaign also points out that Fiorina says she wants to cap federal spending at 20 percent of the gross domestic product -- which Boxer's people said necessarily means ""slashing Medicare and Social Security."" Because Social Security and Medicare are such large parts of the federal budget, they say, it's impossible to achieve spending cuts of that magnitude without cutting the programs, which make up a significant part of the federal budget.

Fiorina has said that entitlements need to be dealt with in a comprehensive manner. ""I'm prepared to look at any and all ideas without stating at this point which I would favor and which I would not. We have to have a comprehensive look at entitlement reform, including Social Security reform,"" she told the Los Angeles Times.

We certainly don't like it when candidates refuse to give specifics about their plans. Fiorina has indicated she would accept some form of cuts to Social Security and Medicare for younger workers, but time and again she has refused to be specific, and only speaks about curtailing future spending for the programs in vague generalities. Still, that does not give the Boxer campaign the right to fill in the blanks. We do know that Fiorina supports slowing the growth of such programs to rein in government spending, but we don't know what specific proposals would look like, and whether they would constitute ""slashing."" And for this reason, we rate Boxer's statement Barely True.

Meg Whitman ad blames Brown for too-generous state pensions
","With California struggling with debt and burdened with costly pension obligations to state workers, Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman is running an ad against Democratic opponent Jerry Brown accusing him of being a shill for labor unions.

Here's the text of the ad:

How can you retire at age 55? Just ask Jerry Brown. He gave California state employees collective bargaining powers. Since then, the unions have grown stronger and stronger. Now, state employees can retire at 55 with much of their salary for life. And taxpayers are on the hook for $100 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. No wonder those unions are 100 percent behind Jerry Brown. He'll just spend and spend and spend.

Brown has a complicated history with labor unions.

It's true that as governor in the late '70s and early '80s, he was a champion of collective bargaining rights. And it's also true that under the current system, state employees in California with 25 years of service can retire at age 55 and receive half their salary for life.

But whether that's a cause and effect relationship, as the ad implies, is debatable.

A little history lesson on California public employee labor laws is in order.

In 1968, then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan signed the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act, establishing collective bargaining for California's municipal and county employees.

But most of the other major collective bargaining laws came during Brown's two terms as governor, between 1975 and 1983. They include the Educational Employment Relations Act of 1976, establishing collective bargaining in California's public schools and community colleges; the Ralph C. Dills Act of 1978, establishing collective bargaining for state government employees; and the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act of 1979, extending collective bargaining to the state university system.

""As you can see, Brown signed the major collective bargaining laws for the state,"" said Dan Mitchell, professor emeritus of management and public policy at UCLA.

But whether Brown rightly deserves blame for the current state of the pension system is less clear.

""None of these laws directly involve pensions,"" Mitchell said. ""Unions can bargain about pensions or other terms and conditions of employment under these laws. Ultimately, the legislature must approve any bargained deals for state workers.""

That's essentially the position of the Brown campaign.

""Collective bargaining didn't create this system,"" said Brown campaign spokesman Sterling Clifford. ""The bargaining created the system.""

It wasn't until 1999 that the state adopted a policy that allowed employees to retire five years earlier, at age 55, and get 2 percent of their annual salary for each year of their employment. In other words, someone who retired at age 55 with 25 years under their belt could get 50 percent of their salary in an annual pension. That's why the Whitman ad -- which states that ""state employees can retire at 55 with much of their salary for life"" -- carries the prominent disclaimer that the scenario ""assumes 25-plus years in state employment."" Someone who retired at age 55 today, but who worked less than 25 years, would get less than half their current salary. According to the California Public Employees’ Retirement System website, the average years of service for all retirees is 19.6 years.

That was a bill signed by then Gov. Gray Davis, 16 years after Brown left office. And it was a measure that caused pension costs to skyrocket.

According to the Brown camp, if the pension plan is a bad deal for taxpayers, the governors and state legislators that negotiated them are to blame.

Since Brown left the governor's office in 1983, there have been four governors, three of them Republicans, Clifford said. ""Any of them could have taken a harder stance on benefits and didn't.""

Clifford notes that in the year after Brown signed the bill giving collective bargaining rights to state employees, ""he then promptly vetoed raises for state employees twice.""

That's true. In July 1979, Brown twice vetoed proposals to give state workers a 14.5 percent pay hike, at a cost of about $220 million to the state. In a move unpopular with the unions, Brown proposed smaller pay increases for the state workers. The state legislature overrode his vetoes.

It's also true that in 1980, Brown okayed a 10.5 percent pay hike for state workers, as well as a 10 percent pension increase for retired state workers.

Brown has, indeed, gotten the support of labor unions in his latest gubernatorial bid, but on his campaign website, he calls the pension programs adopted during the years of the Wall Street boom unsustainable. Brown says he would fight to raise the retirement age and lower pension contributions to all new state workers.

His unpredictable stance on labor was explored in a July 25, 2010, story in the Sacramento Bee, which ran under the headline, ""As governor, Brown had complex relationship with labor.""

""Like many politicians, Brown has seen his relationship with labor fluctuate, influenced less by ideology than by the state of the economy and public sentiment toward government spending,"" wrote the Bee's David Siders. ""Labor leaders today believe public employee unions will be treated better by Brown than by Whitman, and rhetoric from both campaigns supports that view. But Brown's history with public employees suggests that, if elected, he might at times disappoint them.""

The story quotes Marty Morgenstern, Brown's chief labor negotiator when he was governor, saying that Brown's relationship with labor was ""up and down.""

""We allowed collective bargaining,"" Morgenstern said, ""but then bargained tough.""

But the story also argues that Brown's collective bargaining greased the way for union negotiators in future years.

""The measure taken by Brown and the legislature (to allow collective bargaining) was significant, improving employees' ability to negotiate and strengthening the stature of employee unions in state politics,"" the story states.

In an Oct. 2, 2009, commentary piece in the Sacramento Bee, Dan Wallter argued Brown ""created the almost hegemonic power of public worker unions by giving them collective bargaining rights.""

So what to rate the Whitman ad's claim that Brown ""gave California state employees collective bargaining powers. Since then, the unions have grown stronger and stronger. Now, state employees can retire at 55 with much of their salary for life""?

Individually, those facts are all true (although as we noted earlier, you'd have to have worked for 25 years to get at least half your working salary, and most retirees have not). But the implication is that Brown's support of collective bargaining for state employees was responsible for a sweetheart pension deal that many now argue is unsustainable and poses one of the biggest threats to California's future financial health. Perhaps, as some argued, collective bargaining laws set the ground rules that strengthened the unions' position. But subsequent governors and the state legislature still had to negotiate those deals. Brown's track record shows he was sometimes a tough negotiator with the unions. And the most expensive change to the pension program (the one highlighted in the ad) came 16 years after Brown left office. And so we rate the ad's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/22/meg-whitman/meg-whitman-ad-blames-brown-too-generous-state-pen/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Wisconsin', 'Ron Johnson']","
Ron Johnson says there are 57 lawyers, including Russ Feingold, in the U.S. Senate
","
Members of Congress have worked all sorts of interesting jobs before entering politics: casino dealer, meat cutter, major-league pitcher, riverboat captain, Navy battle group commander, toll booth collector, even coroner.

But the most common background is law, as Republican Senate hopeful Ron Johnson is quick to point out.

Johnson, who is facing lawyer and Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, made the point most directly in a recent TV ad. In it, he noted on a whiteboard that 57 of 100 members of the Senate are lawyers.

""That would be fine if we had a lawsuit to settle,"" Johnson went on to say in the ad, ""but we have an economy to fix. There are zero manufacturers and one accountant. It’s no wonder we’re losing jobs and piling up debt. I’m not a politician. I’m an accountant and a manufacturer. I know how to balance a budget, and I do know how to create jobs. Now that’s something we could really use.""

So, is the Senate a majority-lawyer body? And, importantly, is it bereft of people with a business background, as the ad implies?

In making his claim, Johnson, who runs a 100-employee plastics manufacturing plant, cites a 2010 Congressional Research Service paper that shows 57 members of the Senate graduated from law school.

Of course, having a law degree does not mean you were a practicing attorney before entering politics, as Feingold was for six years before and after he became a state lawmaker in 1982. Indeed, our own review of 100 Senate biographies -- yes, we read them all -- found some went right into public service or other careers out of law school.

Case in point: Democrat Charles Schumer of New York, whose official biography says he ran for state Assembly right out of Harvard Law School in 1974.

An earlier study by Congressional Quarterly, completed in 2008 before three changes to the Senate, showed law as the top occupation of senators (54 of them at the time), followed by public service (32) and business (26).  

To make his point, Johnson focuses narrowly on manufacturing and accountants -- two key points on his own résumé.

But PolitiFact Wisconsin found a half-dozen senators who listed experience building and running a company, including Wisconsin’s Herb Kohl, who presided over the Kohl’s grocery and department store chain. More than 20 have at least some business background.

When it comes strictly to manufacturers and accountants, Johnson’s claim is a little off.

If Johnson continues at the helm of Pacur, his Oshkosh-based company, he may be the only active manufacturer.

But Sen. Richard Lugar, Republican from Indiana, lists ""manufacturing company executive"" as one of his careers, according to Congressional Quarterly. His Senate website says he helped manage the family's food machinery manufacturing business in Indianapolis with his brother Tom. That was a long time ago -- before his public career began in the late 1960s.

Meanwhile, Sen. Tom Coburn, Republican from Oklahoma, is best known as a doctor, but in the 1970s he ""served as manufacturing manager at the Ophthalmic Division of Coburn Optical Industries in Colonial Heights, Virginia,"" according to his bio. Under his leadership, the Virginia division of Coburn Optical grew from 13 employees to more than 350 and captured 35 percent of the U.S. market, the bio says.

Johnson says there’s only one accountant in the Senate, but he’s off by one on that -- at least by education. He correctly cites Mike Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, who was an accountant for an oil drilling company, according to his Senate bio.

But Coburn was also educated as an accountant.

So, how does this all tally out?

In touting his background, Republican Ron Johnson says there are 57 lawyers, one accountant and no manufacturers in the U.S. Senate.  He is correct that legal beagles -- not business people -- dominate the body, though some are lawyers by education, not trade. While Johnson’s bean-counting skills were not at their sharpest -- at least two members have a manufacturing background and two an accounting background -- his central point is on the money.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Wisconsin', 'Russ  Feingold']","
Russ Feingold says Ron Johnson would become the 70th millionaire in the Senate if elected
","
Republican Ron Johnson has made clear he thinks the U.S. Senate has a surplus of lawyers, whose ranks include Democrat Russ Feingold, the guy he’s trying to replace.

Feingold’s retort: the more worrisome surplus is millionaires -- and Johnson would add to their ranks.

On the campaign trail, Feingold has long told voters that Johnson, an Oshkosh manufacturing executive,  is trying to buy the seat. More recently, Feingold has hit the theme harder.

""His idea for growing our economy is to give millionaires like himself more tax cuts,"" Feingold told supporters at an Oct. 18, 2010 rally the University of  Wisconsin-Oshkosh.

""He likes to say there are too many lawyers in the Senate – 57. He’d be the 70th millionaire. I think they’re a little over-represented.""   

Is Feingold right on the fat-cat factor?

It’s not an easy question to answer, because senators are not required to disclose their true net worth. Under the required financial disclosure reports, they are allowed to list broad dollar-value ranges for assets and debts.

As support for the claim, Feingold’s campaign cites a widely quoted 2009 study by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. The group’s work takes the 2008 asset and liability figures that senators reported and finds a mid-point to approximate net worth.

The center’s study found that 67 of 100 senators carry a net worth of greater than $1 million. Wisconsin’s Herb Kohl, a Democrat, was the richest on the list at $214 million.

PolitiFact Wisconsin updated the study to include three new senators -- Scott Brown of Massachusetts,  George LeMieux of Florida and Carte Goodwin of West Virginia -- who were appointed or elected after the group’s study came out.

Two of the newbies, LeMieux and Brown, have a net worth above the $1 million mark, based on our calculations using the center’s methodology.

That’s the math the Feingold campaign used to get to Johnson as the 70th: 67 + 2 + Johnson = 70.

Of course that slots Johnson into the current crop of senators. If Johnson wins Nov. 2, he will likely be part of a different mix -- some incumbents are retiring or lost in primaries, others may lose on election day.

How accurate are the numbers compared to senators’ true net worth?

If you take Feingold as an example, the wealth estimates appear to be conservative.

Feingold takes the extra step of voluntarily disclosing his exact net worth through tax returns and a complete statement of net worth. The Journal Sentinel asks Wisconsin members of Congress for that information.

In 2008 Feingold reported a net worth of $452,500 -- far above the $83,000 figure that ranked him one of ""10 poorest"" senators in the Center for Responsive Politics study.

As for Johnson, based on the center’s methodology and his 2010 disclosure form, Johnson’s net worth would be $17.8 million.  

That would put him in the top 15 wealthiest members of the current Senate, though for the others the 2008 figures are being used.

So let’s review our math.

In turning the tables on Johnson, Feingold says the problem isn’t lawyers in the Senate, but millionaires. He pegs Johnson as the would-be 70th, though that would be in the current Senate -- not whatever mix is there after the election. By our calculations, and those of the Center for Responsive Politics, Feingold is accurate. If anything, the methodology underestimates a person’s net worth -- and therefore may under-count the actual millionaires in the body.

Ad: Nathan Deal tried to weaken rape shield law in 1991
","
It's the most incendiary TV ad in the race for governor so far.

An empty Volvo station wagon sits in a desolate parking lot. Its alarm pulses. The driver's side door hangs open. Groceries litter the ground.
   
""It was my niece,"" a woman's voice says. ""If Nathan Deal had won his fight to weaken the rape shield law, and my niece took the stand, she would have been forced to defend what she wore and that she didn’t deserve to be raped.""

Supporters of Democratic candidate Roy Barnes, whose campaign authorized the ad, said the actions of Deal, a Republican, show he doesn't protect women's interests.

Deal's camp called it a new low in a political season dominated by negative attacks and reminded voters Deal was once a prosecutor who put rapists in jail. They also accused Barnes of being soft on child molesters.

Barnes and Deal face off Nov. 2.

All the ugliness of using victims for political gain aside, is there any truth to the ad? Did Deal really fight to weaken the rape shield law? 

Barnes' evidence is a heated, well-documented 1991 General Assembly battle over the state's rape shield law. It pitted Deal against an alliance of women's and victims' rights advocates and prosecutors.

The law, established in 1976, blocks defense attorneys from entering a victim's sexual history into evidence in court under most circumstances. This barred evidence includes whether she has a reputation for promiscuity and her ""mode of dress.""

Deal, who was Senate president pro tem at the time, sponsored a 164-page bill that would have overhauled Georgia's rules of evidence. These are the state's rules on what kinds of evidence is admissible in court.

Then and now, these rules were a patchwork based on old Georgia code. There is a decades-old movement to update them by making them more like federal rules of evidence.

Supporters of this broad-ranging change think the federal rules are more cohesive and in certain cases better.

The movement has supporters at the State Bar of Georgia, which produced the bill Deal introduced in 1991.
 
Women's rights advocates, victim advocates, prosecutors and others were furious that the Bar's proposal included changes to the rape shield law. In a meeting with Deal, his opposition warned that they would make it a ""major issue of the General Assembly session, and the next session if necessary,"" according to an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Deal moved ahead without their support, but the opposition galvanized against him. Women barraged their legislators with phone calls of protest and filled the chambers of the state Senate to show their solidarity.

A headline in what was then called the Fulton County Daily Report, the state's major legal news publication, warned ""New Rules of Evidence Threatened Rape Shield.""

A Columbus Ledger-Enquirer editorial described Deal's bill as a ""Neanderthal law.""

Deal bowed to pressure and amended the bill to address their concerns, but the damage was done. It passed the Senate but never made it out of committee in the state House.

To evaluate Barnes' claims, AJC PolitiFact Georgia dug up Deal's failed two-decade-old, 164-page Senate bill from the Georgia Archives and looked up state and federal rape shield rules that were in effect then. We also evaluated arguments made publicly for and against the changes in 1991 and recently.

Both the bill proposed by Deal and existing Georgia law barred the victim's sexual past from being admissible in court in most cases. Both included an exception if the victim's sexual history with the accused showed the incident may have been consensual.

But the law proposed by Deal permitted four new exceptions to the rule.

The biggest was this: If prosecutors presented physical evidence including semen, injury, pregnancy, or disease to prove the victim was raped, then a judge could allow a defense attorney to enter evidence about a victim's sexual past.

And unlike the existing rape shield, the proposed version did not explicitly bar the accuser's ""mode of dress"" from entering into evidence. 

In Deal'sproposed law, if defense attorneys wanted to include a victim's sexual past, they would make a motion on the issue when the jury was not present. The judge would then hear arguments from both sides in his chambers, and might hear testimony from witnesses.

If the judge found the value of the evidence outweighs the ""danger of unfair prejudice,"" it would be admissible, the proposed law said. The judge would then lay ground rules for what would be allowed in the courtroom.

The author of the proposed 1991 changes is Georgia State University law professor Paul Milich. He declined to comment for this story, but confirmed he did argue in online comments on The AJC's Political Insider, the blog of columnist Jim Galloway, that no one ""was remotely suggesting"" Georgia weaken or reduce its protections for rape victims. The proposal actually strengthened protections for them.

Milich said that the changes would have broadened the shield to cover all sex assault victims, not just rape victims. This is argument is technically correct, but has its limits.  By 1991, judges had already ruled the law applied to victims of other sex crimes, according to case law.

Milich also noted that Barnes was on the state Bar's Evidence Study Committee, which would have had to review the proposal before the Bar backed it.

The Bar confirmed that both Deal and Barnes were part of that committee, but said they do not keep records on its votes. We asked Deal's camp and others for evidence Barnes voted in favor of the law, but they did not provide it. 

Barnes said through a spokeswoman that he doesn't recall attending meetings of the group.

Third, Milich said his version of the law would require a judge to evaluate whether to admit the victim's sexual past based on a strict standard.

It's correct that the proposal would require a judge weigh the ""danger of unfair prejudice"" against the victim against the value of the evidence. That standard was absent from Georgia's existing statute. 

Still, it remains that if Deal's bill passed, because of the additional exceptions, defense attorneys would gain new opportunities to enter an accuser's sexual past into evidence.

So Deal did push for a bill that would give the defense more options. But did he actually fight to weaken the rape shield law, as the Barnes ad said?

Deal said he was actually trying to make the rape shield law conform to federal standards and strengthen it against possible constitutional challenges.

But these defenses have serious weaknesses. Georgia's rape shield law did not face a clear threat of being overturned by a constitutional challenge.  By 1991, the rape shield law was 15 years old and had withstood a constitutional challenge in state Supreme Court. There has been no successful challenge since. That spring, the U.S. Supreme Court made its first ruling on a rape shield law, and upheld it.

Furthermore, Deal's proposed revisions fell short of conforming to 1991 federal standards. They would have given defense attorneys more leeway than those rules allowed.

Under federal rules, defense attorneys had to warn prosecutors and the accuser 15 days before trial if they planned to present evidence about the victim's sexual past. Deal's proposal didn't require this advanced warning. 

Also, federal rules list only semen and injury as the kinds of physical evidence that could open a victim's sexual past to being entered as evidence. Deal's law added pregnancy, disease, ""or other physical evidence"" to the list.   

So what does all this mean?

Barnes' claim is correct, but it leaves out important details.

Because Barnes's ad is so incendiary it's important to note that we have no proof that Deal's effort came from anything but out of concern for the rights of the accused.

While in hindsight there was no looming threat that the rape shield would fall to a constitutional challenge, there were concerns at the time that rape shield laws in general may not be fair.

And while the proposed law would have opened more opportunities for the defense to question an accuser on his or her past sexual behavior, it did include a process to prevent it from becoming a free-for-all for the defense.

It's also important to note that this debate took place nearly 20 years ago, not recently.

A more balanced way to put it is this: Deal started by leading a fight to overhaul the state's rules of evidence. This included making changes to the rape shield that gave the defense leeway that didn't exist in state law or federal rules.

Legislators, prosecutors and victims advocates gave Deal fair warning that they would wage war if he didn't back off.
 
Still, Deal pursued the change until public protest reached a fevered pitch.  And while he didn't fight to help rapists or hurt victims, he invested his political capital as second-in-command in the state Senate on behalf of a law that weakened the rape shield act.

Statements that are accurate but leave out important details or take things out of context meet the Truth-O-Meter's definition of Half True. That's what we rule.",/factchecks/2010/oct/22/roy-barnes/barnes-said-gubertorial-race-opponent-deal-tried-w/

Bruce Starr claims to be the only state senator to vote for stronger ethics laws
","
One of the nastiest local races this year is in Washington County, where state Sen. Bruce Starr is fending off an aggressive challenge from Rep. Chuck Riley. Starr is a Republican finishing his second term in the Senate, District 15; Riley is a Democrat completing his third term in the House, District 29.

Riley has made a big to-do over Starr’s ethics, highlighting the fact that he accepted a free trip to Maui to attend a beer and wine distributors’ conference in 2002. Riley’s campaign also filed a complaint with the Oregon secretary of state’s office, which is still under review, alleging that Starr had claimed too much in mileage reimbursement.  

For his part, Starr released an ad featuring retired Navy Capt. Greg Wooldridge attesting to the senator’s high ethical standards.

But what caught our attention in the TV spot was this claim, spoken by the announcer: ""Bruce Starr was the only senator to vote for stronger ethics laws and greater accountability."" A copy of Senate Bill 30 from the 2009 legislative session appears onscreen, implying that was the bill Starr voted for.

The only senator? Was Starr the only yes vote on SB 30? And if the bill was so ethically swell, why didn’t the other senators vote yes, too?

But wait: Starr didn’t vote for Senate Bill 30 at all. He voted against it.

PolitiFact Oregon is as confused as you are. Let’s back up.

In late 2006 The Oregonian wrote about a number of legislators who failed to report free trips to Hawaii courtesy of the Oregon Beer and Wine Distributors Association. In response, lawmakers in 2007 approved Senate Bill 10, prohibiting public officials from accepting out-of-state trips, entertainment and fancy meals from lobbyists. The bill expanded which public officials had to report their finances and increased how often they and lobbyists had to file -- from once a year to four times a year. It became law.

Then the complaints started. Rural volunteer commissioners quit en masse, calling the disclosure forms onerous and invasive. The disclosure forms also asked for the names of all family members. And nobody liked reporting four times a year when they had nothing new to report.

The 2009 Legislature hustled to tweak the law. In the end, Senate Bill 30 allowed limited entertainment and kept a cap on gifts and entertainment to $50 from a single source in a year. Disclosure reports were cut back to every year. More public officials were required to report. It passed.

Starr’s was the only no vote in the Senate, as well as in the House, on final passage. He offered no explanation at the time and says now he can’t remember if he offered one anywhere else. In an interview this week, he said he voted against SB 30 because he wanted to maintain the more frequent reporting requirements of Senate Bill 10 for legislators.

""The issue I was most concerned about was rolling back the fact that legislators didn’t have to report quarterly,"" he said. "" ... If they had separated the issues, I likely would have voted for SB 30.""

Starr is correct on that one, narrow issue. More often is better when it comes to disclosure. But to say he was the only senator to vote for stronger ethics laws is wrong. Both Senate bills 10 and 30 sharply curtailed entertainment, meals and trips offered by lobbyists and strengthened Oregon’s ethics laws, and many senators voted in favor of the stricter rules.

We rate this False.

Bill White says that Gov. Rick Perry became a millionaire as an elected state official
","
This year's Democratic gubernatorial nominee, whose campaign is called ""Bill White for Texas,"" has latched onto the idea that GOP Gov. Rick Perry is for ... Rick Perry. 
""Rick Perry has become a millionaire on the public payroll,"" the narrator says in a TV ad that was posted on YouTube Oct. 4. ""He's a career politician who's taken a government check for 25 years, and today, he's a millionaire."" The words ""Murky land deal mark Gov. Rick Perry's past"" and ""Gov. Perry wealth fueled by land deals"" appear on the screen. 
It's not novel for White to niggle Perry about his wealth; he earlier zeroed in on the governor living in a posh rental home while the Governor's Mansion is repaired. But we haven't yet explored White's claim that Perry's gotten rich while a state official. 
Some background: White is correct that Perry has been in elected office 25 years. He was elected as a Democrat to the Texas House in 1984 and after switching parties was elected state agriculture commissioner in 1990 and then lieutenant governor in 1998. He succeeded Gov. George W. Bush, who was elected president, in late 2000 and was elected twice to that office in his own right. As of January 2010, Perry had been in one state office or another for more than 25 years. He's seeking his third full term as governor. 
While working for the state, Perry's pay has increased from $7,200 a year while serving as a legislator to $150,000 annually, according to a September 2009 story in the Associated Press. According to Perry's 2009 income tax return, he and Anita reported an adjusted gross income of $200,370. 
But income doesn't factor into this millionaire equation. White's campaign told us it gauges Perry's 'millionaire' status based on his net worth — his assets minus his liabilities. 
Not that there's anything wrong with personal wealth, White would likely say. As of April 30, the market value of White's liquid net worth — cash, publicly-traded stocks and mutual funds — was approximately $2.7 million, according to a comparison by the White campaign of White's and Perry's publicly disclosed financial information. Additional assets include IRA accounts with about $2 million invested in common stocks and mutual funds. 
In 2009, White, and his wife Andrea, reported $659,762 in adjusted gross income, according to their income tax return for that year. 
To back up White's claim about Perry becoming a millionaire while working for taxpayers, White spokeswoman Katy Bacon pointed us to a Sept. 26, 2009 AP news story cited in the ad. ""Gov. Rick Perry never had much money growing up,"" the story says, ""and he has spent most of his adult life in public office, drawing a part-time salary as a legislator and relatively modest earnings in statewide office for the last quarter century. But thanks to his investments and a series of private land deals, some that took advantage of his political connections, Perry has squeaked over the millionaire line."" 
According to Perry's 1984 financial statement, he had at least $28,000 in assets and at least $15,000 in liabilities — a net worth of $13,000. 
According to the AP, which analyzed 18 years worth of Perry's public financial records with the help of Houston accountant Bob Martin, some real estate investments were extremely rewarding for Perry. Most recently, in 2007, Perry sold lakefront Horseshoe Bay property he'd acquired in 2001 for $1.4 million, making a profit of $823,766. In their federal tax filing covering 2007, Perry and his wife, Anita, reported $1.09 million in adjusted gross income. The year before, they reported $204,065 in adjusted gross income. 
Martin told us that the money Perry has made on real estate transactions alone most likely propelled his net worth past $1 million. 
According to the AP, the blind trust has produced at least $600,000 in income since 1997. Perry's income tax returns also show that the trust posted a loss of about $567,000 in 2008, according to a Sept. 2 story in the Austin American-Statesman. Martin told us that loss probably resulted from Perry bailing out of the stock market when the economy soured. 
But it's difficult to know precisely how much Perry is worth because he, like some other elected officials, keeps his financial holdings in a blind trust he established in 1996. Under a 2003 state law, officeholders are not supposed to know what the trust holds or what assets are acquired or disposed of — those decisions are left to a trustee, whom the elected official selects. His 2009 financial statement only reveals that the blind trust is worth $25,000 or more — the highest value bracket on the form. 
Allison Castle, a spokeswoman in the governor's office, said that as of August 2009, Perry's blind trust was worth $896,000, according to several news stories. We sought up-to-date information from the governor on his assets and liabilities but didn't hear back. 
In analyzing Perry's income tax returns and financial statements, which list Perry's assets and liabilities that aren't in the blind trust in a value bracket, Martin told us that he used the lowest possible value of each asset, minus the lowest possible value of each liability. The net worth: about $1 million, including the value of the blind trust. 
According to Perry's 2009 financial statement, he earned at least $10,000 from an investment partnership he owns with his father, and the house the Perrys owned in College Station was appraised at $243,900 last year, according to the Brazos County Appraisal District. According to the county website, the house deed passed to new owners on Feb. 5, 2010. He earned at least $2,000 in rent from tenants living in his College Station house, and had at least $70,000 in liabilities, including a car loan for a Mercedes-Benz. 
Not disclosed: the value of his retirement fund, often a big component of one's asset mix. Perry hasn't released that figure but if he were to retire at the end of this term, he could receive as much as $86,250 per year in state retirement. Or, he could choose to receive a check for up to 36 months of his standard pension as a lump sum worth $258,750 before taxes. (His future pension payments would be permanently reduced after that.) 
Our calculation: In 2009, Perry's net worth was at least $1,081,900. Perry's assets totalled $1,151,900 (at least $10,000 from investments, $243,900 from his house, at least $2,000 in rent from tenants living in his College Station house and $896,000 from his blind trust, as of August 2009). His liabilities amounted to at least $70,000 in personal notes. 
Martin said that nothing in the Perrys' 2009 tax return suggests that his net worth dropped below $1 milllion, but the lack of public information about his blind trust makes it impossible to tell for sure. 
And that's the hitch in White's claim. Since Perry's financial holdings are not public, much is unknown. Still, available records lead us to conclude the governor was worth about $1 million in 2009. He was worth far less before he entered state office.

Yet he has also expressed reluctance at the possibility of jeopardizing the United States’ lucrative arms trade with Riyadh. Even as he’s highlighted the financial stakes underlying U.S.-Saudi relations, Trump has said he has no personal business ties to Saudi Arabia. ""For the record, I have no financial interests in Saudi Arabia (or Russia, for that matter),"" Trump tweeted Oct. 16, after reports detailed his past commercial transactions with Saudi partners. ""Any suggestion that I have is just more FAKE NEWS (of which there is plenty)!""  For the record, I have no financial interests in Saudi Arabia (or Russia, for that matter). Any suggestion that I have is just more FAKE NEWS (of which there is plenty)! The Trump Organization also said in a statement that, ""Like many global real estate companies, we have explored opportunities in many markets,"" but added, ""we do not have any plans for expansion into Saudi Arabia."" Trump’s recent comments present a sharp contrast with remarks he made on the 2016 campaign trail when he boasted about his financial ties to Saudi Arabia. ""Saudi Arabia, I like the Saudis,"" Trump said at a July 2015 rally. ""I make a lot of money with them. They buy all sorts of my stuff. All kinds of toys from Trump. They pay me millions and hundred of millions."" We decided to take a closer look at transactions between Trump and Saudi business partners. We found no evidence that Trump or the Trump Organization owns property or invests in Saudi Arabia. However, Trump has profited from business dealings with Saudis dating back at least to the 1990s, and his hotels continue to generate revenue from Saudi interests. In June 2001, Trump sold the entire 45th floor of Trump World Tower to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, according to multiple reports. The apartments, located near the United Nations headquarters, were later converted in 2008 into part of the Saudi Mission to the UN. The transaction earned Trump $4.5 million, according to the New York Daily News, citing a New York City Finance Department spokeswoman. The Daily News obtained documents showing the deal involved five apartments, which included 10 bedrooms and 13 bathrooms. In addition to the purchase price, the annual charges of more than $85,000 for building amenities — assuming they remained the same through the years — means ""Trump was paid at least $5.7 million by the Saudi government since 2001,"" the Daily News wrote in a September 2016 article. Other reports say Trump pocketed as much as $12 million in the sale. That figure comes from the Associated Press, citing the brokerage site Streeteasy, which said Trump’s 2001 deal with the Saudis ""was the biggest purchase in that building to that point."" In his 2016 bid for the White House, Trump touted his real estate transactions with the Saudis. ""Saudi Arabia — and I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me,"" Trump said at an Aug. 21, 2015, rally. ""They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much."" Reports show that Trump has profited from deals with the Saudis since at least the early 1990s. According to the Associated Press, Trump was ""teetering on personal bankruptcy and scrambling to raise cash"" in 1991 when Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin-Talal agreed to buy Trump’s yacht. The 280-foot yacht, named ""Princess,"" sold for $20 million, which according to the Associated Press, was a third less than what Trump is reported to have paid for it. In 1995, Prince Alwaleed was among a group of investors who paid $325 million for Trump's Plaza Hotel, which looks over Manhattan’s Central Park. According to the Associated Press, the hotel at the time of purchase was a money-losing venture. Even as president, Trump hotels continue to earn business from Saudi interests, reports show. Groups lobbying on behalf of the Saudi government spent $270,000 at Trump’s Washington hotel, according to a Washington Post investigation. The bill included some $190,000 for rooms, $78,000 spent on catering and $1,600 for parking, according to lobbyist filings. ""The bill was ultimately paid by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" the Post reported. A separate Washington Post investigation found that visits to Trump hotels by big-spending Saudis were responsible for a revenue bump. A letter obtained by the Post from the general manager of the Trump International Hotel in Manhattan said ""a last-minute visit to New York by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia"" had been a major factor in a 13 percent bump in revenue from room rentals for the first three months of 2018 — after two years of declining figures. The Post reported that while the Crown Prince did not personally stay at the hotel, accommodating his accompanying travelers for a five-day stay in March ""was enough to boost the hotel’s revenue for the entire quarter."" In July, a federal judge in Maryland ruled that a lawsuit could proceed against Trump over his Washington hotel’s acceptance of payments from foreign governments. The suit alleges that by collecting such revenues — from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as well as other foreign governments — Trump is violating the Constitution’s foreign Emoluments Clause. The judge found that while Trump does not ""actively manage"" the Trump International Hotel, he ""continues to own and purportedly controls"" it, as well as the adjoining restaurant and event spaces, and ""actually or potentially shares in the revenues."" The accountability watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, is involved in the suit, which was brought by the District of Columbia and Maryland. A spokesman for CREW said Trump’s continued business dealings at Trump Hotel DC — less than a mile from the White House — represents a serious conflict of interest. ""The problems — both ethical and Constitutional — with the president's businesses profiting off foreign governments like Saudi Arabia are in the profits themselves, not the physical location of the businesses,"" said CREW spokesman Jordan Libowitz.  Trump said, ""I have no financial interests in Saudi Arabia."" We found no evidence that Trump or the Trump Organization owns property in Saudi Arabia. However, Trump has profited handsomely from business dealings with Saudis dating back at least to the 1990s. Even during his presidency, Trump hotels continues to earn business from the Saudi government, reports show. In fact, Trump’s Washington hotel’s acceptance of payments from foreign governments — including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia — is the basis on an ongoing lawsuit against Trump. We rate this Half True.

"['Economy', 'Pennsylvania', 'Scott Wagner']","
Scott Wagner says Pa.’s unemployment rate is 20 percent higher than the national rate. It isn't.
","In an Oct. 11 fundraising email sent to supporters, Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Wagner said his opponent, Democratic incumbent Tom Wolf, ""has failed Pennsylvanians,"" adding, ""Our unemployment rate is 20 percent higher than the national average."" PolitiFact Pennsylvania repeatedly asked Wagner’s campaign for evidence supporting the claim and got no response, so we decided to mine the data ourselves. And since Wagner’s campaign didn’t place a timeframe on his claim — other than using the present tense — we decided to see if anyone else had. We found a June tweet from Matt Brouillette, current president and CEO of Commonwealth Partners and former president and CEO of the conservative Commonwealth Foundation. In it, Brouillette wrote in response to a tweet from U.S. Rep. Keith Rothfus about national economic figures: ""Yet under @GovernorTomWolf's tenure, PA's unemployment rate remains upwards of 20% higher than the national average."" In an email response to PolitiFact Pennsylvania, Brouillette pointed to April when Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate was 4.7 percent and the national rate was 3.9. Brouillette said this puts Pennsylvania’s rate at 20.5 percent above the national rate. Here’s the math: (4.7 - 3.9) / 3.9 = .205 x 100 = 20.5 percent Obviously one could also say that Pennsylvania’s rate was, in absolute terms, 0.8 percentage points higher than the national rate in April, but that number is far less impactful, especially if, like Wagner, your intent is to besmirch the sitting governor who also happens to be your political opponent. ""Using a percentage change is not that uncommon, especially if it works to make the point more dramatic,"" said G. Terry Madonna, professor of public affairs and director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College. Erin E. Delaney, an economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, explained, ""It’s usually not necessary to calculate a percent change with percentages because they are already comparable as is (unlike if you were looking to compare unemployment levels)."" Delaney added, ""... calculating a percent change could be misleading if all of the facts are not presented. Because the numbers are smaller in the first instance, the percent difference is exaggerated — especially confusing since both of the rates would be more favorable than the higher rates with the smaller percentage difference."" So, Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate was 20 percent — not 20 percentage points — higher than the national rate in April. But is that still the case, given the present tense used in Wagner’s email? No. Not even close. Based on U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics data, in August 2018 — the most recent month for which state data are available — Pennsylvania’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4.1 percent. The national seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3.9 percent. That’s a 0.2 percentage point or 5 percent difference, not a 20 percent difference as Wagner claims. Seasonally adjusted numbers take into account fluctuations and trends in employment numbers that re-occur each year. This includes winter slowdowns in agriculture, construction and other seasonal industries, the pickups seen every June as students take summer jobs, and the hiring and layoff patterns that coincide with winter and summer holidays. Seasonally adjusted stats are generally considered a more reliable indicator of unemployment trends. Brouillette used them in support of his claim about April’s disparity between state and national unemployment rates. But even by his own account, that disparity has dwindled considerably since, with Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate sitting at 0.2 percentage points or 5 percent higher than the national rate in August. And when looking at not-seasonally adjusted numbers, Wagner’s claim doesn’t fare any better. The not-seasonally adjusted number in Pennsylvania was 4.4 percent in August and 3.9 percent nationwide. That’s a 12 percent difference. In fact, with the exception of April, at no point since Gov. Tom Wolf was inaugurated in January of 2015 has the state unemployment rate been 20 percent higher than the national rate. The closest it’s come is 18.4 percent or 0.7 percentage points in May when Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate was 4.5 to the nation’s 3.8. Our ruling Pennsylvania did have an unemployment rate that was 20 percent — not 20 percentage points — higher than the national rate in April. But Wagner is wrong to claim it stilldoes. The most recent data shows Pennsylvania’s rate in August was 5 percent above the national rate. For these reasons, we rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2018/oct/18/scott-wagner/scott-wagner-says-pas-unemployment-rate-20-percent/

Scott Walker says he would cover pre-existing conditions, but backs plans that would end protections
","Like Democrat Tammy Baldwin against Republican Leah Vukmir in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race, Tony Evers has been hitting Scott Walker on pre-existing conditions in the governor’s race. Baldwin, the incumbent senator, claimed Vukmir supports letting insurance companies ""deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions."" Our rating was Half True. Join us for a free PolitiFact event in Milwaukee. Meanwhile, Evers, the Democratic nominee for governor, has made similar attacks on Walker, the two-term incumbent, ahead of the Nov. 6, 2018 election. One attack comes in a video posted Oct. 10, 2018 in which Evers claims Walker supports ""a health care plan that would gut protections for pre-existing conditions."" Let’s see what plan Evers is referring to. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. As we noted in the Baldwin fact check, at issue here is the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and its prohibition on insurers denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. Under the federal law, if you don’t have health insurance from an employer or the government, you have guaranteed access to insurance in the individual market, regardless of your health, and you can’t be charged higher rates for a pre-existing condition. That blanket protection is something that is threatened by Republican efforts to repeal the law, and Walker supports repeal. For example, he backed the so-called Graham-Cassidy repeal bill, saying: ""I think it’s awesome… It’s a winner all the way around."" News reports said that under the bill, states could have allowed for waivers to let insurers charge sick patients higher premiums and stop covering certain benefits required under the Affordable Care Act; and that states could obtain waivers to permit insurers to charge different premiums based on health status, age or other factors. PolitiFact National, noting that Democrats across the country are attacking Republicans over pre-existing conditions, has reported that Republican proposals are not as air tight as Obamacare when it comes to pre-existing conditions. Graham-Cassidy would have allowed insurers to sell bare-bones plans with low premiums that would be attractive to healthy people, while plans that provide the coverage that sicker people need would be very expensive, our colleagues reported. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. So, repeal of Obamacare  — and its protections for pre-existing conditions -- is one plan Walker supports. But there’s another. Walker also backed a lawsuit brought by Wisconsin and 19 other states that a New York Times news story said could eviscerate major parts of the Affordable Care Act and allow insurers to again deny people coverage because of their medical condition or history. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. So, Walker supports two plans, or initiatives, that would result in eliminating blanket protections for people with pre-existing conditions. To be clear, Walker hasn’t said people with pre-existing conditions shouldn’t be covered. But he hasn’t spelled out an alternative that would provide protections that Obamacare does. Walker has repeatedly promised to cover people with pre-existing conditions and has pledged to pass legislation to guarantee them coverage. For example, he called for such a law in his January 2018 state of the state speech. And in September 2018, he said he would call a special session of the Legislature to adopt that measure if the Affordable Care Act were blocked. The prospects for such a bill passing, however, are unclear. Moreover, Walker has provided few details on what he has in mind, raising questions about how people with pre-existing conditions would be covered. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel examined what would happen to people in Wisconsin with pre-existing conditions if Obamacare were overturned. In short, the fates of some them are uncertain. The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover specific health benefits, including prescription drugs for almost every medical condition. So, without a similar requirement in state law, insurers could sidestep any requirement that they cover pre-existing health conditions. They could do this by not including some services or costly drugs in a health plan's benefits. It’s also worth noting that before Obamacare, Wisconsin’s high-risk pool was held up as something as a model on pre-existing conditions, at least for the people it covered. But it worked only for people who could afford the insurance in the first place  — and many people with pre-existing conditions could not afford coverage from the high-risk pool, as it covered fewer than 25,000 people. An estimated 852,000 people in Wisconsin have a health condition that would have led to being denied coverage in the market for health insurance sold directly to individuals and families before the Affordable Care Act. Evers says Walker supports ""a health care plan that would gut protections for pre-existing conditions."" Walker has supported two efforts that would result in elimination of blanket protections for pre-existing conditions: Legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and a lawsuit that would block it. The law provides a variety of protections to people with pre-existing medical conditions — including prohibiting insurers from denying coverage to those people and prohibiting them from charging those people higher rates. So, getting rid of Obamacare would eliminate those protections. Walker has pledged that if Obamacare is repealed, he would seek legislation to guarantee coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. But it’s not clear how that legislation would compare to Obamacare and not clear if it could pass the Legislature. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/oct/18/tony-evers/scott-walker-says-he-would-cover-pre-existing-cond/

Fact-checking an attack on Ron DeSantis about pre-existing conditions and Affordable Care Act
","Florida Democrats are turning Ron DeSantis’ Obamacare opposition against him in the state’s closely watched governor’s race. An ad for Democrat Andrew Gillum's campaign highlights patients with conditions including breast cancer, asthma, epilepsy and arthritis. ""They are called pre-existing conditions and everybody knows somebody who has one,"" says the ad produced in partnership with the Florida Democratic Party. The ad then pivots to DeSantis’ time in the U.S. House. (He resigned in September to focus on his campaign.) ""But in Congress, Ron DeSantis demanded that any new health law eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions,"" the narrator says. ""He’d let insurance companies deny them coverage. And when he was asked what cancer patients should do without health insurance, DeSantis said 'show up to the emergency room.'"" In a related fact-check, we explained the full context of the comment DeSantis made about the emergency room and cancer patients. DeSantis and Gillum could not be further apart on health care. Gillum has called for expanding access to health care and supports Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All proposal, and DeSantis supported efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. DeSantis has been quiet on health care policy that he likes so far in his campaign. He has not yet released a health care plan, and the issues page on his website doesn’t mention the topic as of three weeks before Election Day. Did DeSantis really call for not including pre-existing conditions in a new law? His comments were more nuanced. The crux of the Democrats’ attack focuses on a decision by DeSantis to support House Republicans’ American Health Care Act, a 2017 bill that put protections for pre-existing health conditions in jeopardy. The Affordable Care Act barred insurers from rejecting people on the basis of pre-existing conditions, or charging them exorbitant rates for their premiums. We didn’t find examples that showed DeSantis ""demanded"" protections for pre-existing conditions be dropped in a new bill. But he was a part of the conservative wing of House Republicans, known as the Freedom Caucus, which did appear to force changes in the legislation behind the scenes. In March 2017, Freedom Caucus members said they wanted the bill to attack the law’s insurance coverage mandates, the Washington Post reported. House leaders who drafted the bill had steered clear of insurance mandates, but the Freedom Caucus didn’t want a watered-down bill. ""I think we can probably be more aggressive,"" DeSantis said at the time. The Freedom Caucus wanted several of the key provisions of the law repealed, including the individual and employer mandates, the essential health coverage required in every plan and community rating rules that limit the factors insurers can use when setting premiums. DeSantis was part of the Freedom Caucus meeting with President Donald Trump about plans to change the bill. When the caucus wouldn’t join Republican leadership, the bill collapsed. DeSantis issued a statement calling the bill a ""a flawed piece of legislation produced by a hasty process"" which left ""the core architecture of Obamacare in place"" and didn’t do enough to addressing rising premiums and lack of consumer choice. Republicans continued to work on it. In late April 2017, Fox’s Lou Dobbs asked DeSantis about the effort by the Freedom Caucus to get the necessary votes for a health care plan. DeSantis replied: ""Well, I think we should get the votes. I mean, we promised to fully repeal it. That's what I think we should do. That's what most conservatives want to do. We have resistance to doing that, so this bill is a compromise bill that rolls back a lot of Obamacare, then allows states to effectively opt out of the premium-hiking regulations. ""And so that should be something that everyone in the conference should be able to get behind who ran on repealing Obamacare. And I think if we do that, and hopefully, the Senate will make it better, and the states that opt out, I think you can see some premiums start to go down, which would be a huge win for consumers."" The New York Times explained a series of changes to the bill that won over the Freedom Caucus, including one that would affect people with pre-existing conditions. States would be allowed to waive a rule to allow higher prices for consumers who had a lapse in coverage of more than 63 days. Then, these consumers would buy insurance through a separate pool. This would have undermined the key provision of the Affordable Care Act to ban insurers from charging higher prices to those with pre-existing conditions. While the Freedom Caucus wanted to push health care closer to the pre-ACA days, the legislation didn’t do away with pre-existing condition protections completely. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 6.3 million people could potentially face higher premiums for one year under the bill due to pre-existing health conditions. On May 4, 2017, DeSantis joined a narrow majority to vote for the bill, which passed the House on a mostly partisan 217-213 vote. (It later died in the Senate.) The Democrats also point to comments by DeSantis in favor of a subsequent effort to overhaul the bill, known as the Graham-Cassidy bill. ""So I think that this is clearly better than Obamacare,"" DeSantis said on Fox Business News Sept. 21, 2017. ""It really empowers the states to fashion solutions. And I think that would be good for a large number of states who really are suffering under Obamacare."" That bill did address pre-existing conditions, by requiring states to show they intended to keep coverage accessible and affordable if they wanted billions in federal aid dollars. But other parts of the bill would have allowed states to give insurance companies a free hand in charging those people higher premiums. Experts said the bill’s language protecting people with pre-existing conditions was vague and subject to broad interpretation. This bill also died. DeSantis, much like other Republicans nationwide this year, has been trying to thread the awkward needle of opposing the Affordable Care Act while declaring support for pre-existing condition protection. WPLG’s Glenna Milberg asked DeSantis about pre-existing conditions at an Oct. 15 campaign event in West Miami a few weeks after the ad appeared. DeSantis replied ""100 percent you need pre-existing."" He also said that before Obamacare, pre-existing condition protection existed, which isn’t quite right. Before, individual market insurers in all but five states maintained lists of so-called declinable medical conditions, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Many insurers also maintained a list of declinable medications.   A spokesman for DeSantis told the Tampa Bay Times in September that DeSantis supports protections for pre-existing conditions. His campaign did not respond to our request for comment. Gillum's ad said, ""In Congress, Ron DeSantis demanded that any new health law eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions."" We didn’t find an example of DeSantis individually demanding protections for pre-existing conditions be dropped in a new bill. However, he was part of the Freedom Caucus, the conservative wing of the House, that forced changes that weakened protections for pre-existing conditions. ""Eliminate"" is too strong. In May 2017, DeSantis voted in favor of the Republicans’ American Health Care Act in 2017, an Obamacare replacement bill that would have put pre-existing condition protection in jeopardy for some patients. DeSantis also voted for the Graham-Cassidy bill that said states had to show they intended to keep coverage accessible and affordable in order to get federal aid. But the bill also would have allowed states to let insurance companies charge higher premiums to sicker people.

Did Ron DeSantis say cancer patients should be treated at emergency rooms?
","Democrats are capitalizing on Ron DeSantis’ opposition to the Affordable Care Act in an ad that portrays him as having little concern for cancer patients. ""In Congress, Ron DeSantis demanded that any new health law eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions,"" said an ad for Andrew Gillum's campaign produced with the Florida Democratic Party. ""He’d let insurance companies deny them coverage. And when he was asked what cancer patients should do without health insurance, DeSantis said 'show up to the emergency room.'"" We will explain the context of the comments by DeSantis about cancer patients and the emergency room. In a related fact-check we will explain the ad’s evidence related to his stance on pre-existing conditions. DeSantis, a longtime critic of the Affordable Care Act, was first elected to Congress in 2012 and resigned in September to focus on his race for governor against Gillum. A DeSantis campaign spokesman didn’t respond for this fact-check. The statement about the emergency room stemmed from a March 8, 2017, appearance by DeSantis on Erin Burnett’s OutFront on CNN about a House Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. The show included a clip of an interview with Republican Tiffany Koehler, who found out she had cancer shortly after she lost a race for the Wisconsin State Assembly. Koehler said she could only afford chemotherapy as a result of her state’s Medicaid expansion. Burnett asked DeSantis about Koehler’s situation (the bold emphasis is ours): Burnett: ""I want to start with Tiffany's story that you just heard there because of course, the GOP House plan that we've seen does roll back the Medicaid expansion. And I know you think it doesn’t quite do enough on that front. What do you say to Tiffany? I mean, she's a Republican, but, you know, she wouldn't be alive, she wouldn't be here without that Medicaid expansion and Obamacare."" DeSantis: ""Well, if you remember when Obamacare was enacted, there were millions of people who had their health care canceled. And so there are stories of people who had certain needs, cancer or whatnot who got pushed into policies that they didn't want, and then they didn't have the same coverage that they had because of the broken promise. So I think this law has really created a lot of different aspects. ""I would say though, and people who supported Obamacare used to make this point a lot before it passed, there really is no lack of health care. If people really need it, if they show up to the emergency room, they do get care, it just gets passed on --"" Burnett: ""But not -- I mean, she had $1 million in cancer treatments. You're not going to get that by showing up in an emergency room."" DeSantis pivoted to his opinion that the health care law isn’t sustainable. For the rest of the interview, neither DeSantis nor Burnett brought up anything about patients showing up at an emergency room. So DeSantis did make the statement that if people need care they can go to the ER, but he was speaking broadly and not only about a cancer patient. A few days later at a testy town hall over health care at Bethune-Cookman University, DeSantis addressed his emergency room comment. He said ""he had conflated two ideas"" and that going to the emergency room ""was not the way to handle that situation,"" according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. (PolitiFact was unable to find a full video of that town hall.) Because emergency rooms by law cannot turn patients away, they can become a health care provider of last resort. President Barack Obama had expressed hope that the Affordable Care Act would lower emergency room use. In 2017, we found that there was strong evidence that emergency room usage hadn’t declined much, if at all, since the law largely took effect in 2013. There’s also evidence that it has increased. Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, told PolitiFact the problem with cancer treatment in emergency rooms is the lack of continuity of care. ""Many hospitals, especially public hospitals, will have clinics and similar programs to treat people in a more ongoing way,"" she said, ""but it still tends to be a very expensive way to receive care."" A Gillum ad said, ""When he was asked what cancer patients should do without health insurance, DeSantis said 'show up to the emergency room.'"" What he said is not that cut and dried. DeSantis did bring up the requirement that everyone be treated in the emergency room when a CNN host asked what he would say to a cancer patient who benefited from Medicaid expansion. In context, however, he appeared to be talking more broadly about ""how there really is no lack of health care."" He side-stepped the direct question, for sure. But he did not straight-up say that cancer patients should seek care at the ER. At a town hall a few days later, DeSantis said ""he had conflated two ideas"" and that going to the emergency room ""was not the way to handle that situation.""

Holding ad lacks key detail of Orange County immigrant case
","State leaders outlawed sanctuary cities in North Carolina in 2015, but that hasn’t kept the issue off the airwaves in North Carolina’s 2nd Congressional District. Incumbent Republican George Holding is trying to fend off a challenge from Democrat Linda Coleman in the district, which spans several counties around Raleigh. Holding recently released video and radio ads claiming Coleman supports sanctuary cities, with an example of how he maintains they hurt the community. Holding’s ad tells the story of Udiel Aguilar-Castellanos, though it does not mention his name. The video ad says ""an illegal immigrant sexually assaulted a child in Carrboro. ICE wanted to deport him, but Orange County released him — like a sanctuary city. Linda Coleman supports sanctuary cities. George Holding opposes sanctuary cities that protect criminals."" The radio ad goes into a little more detail: ""An illegal immigrant was arrested for a DUI in Durham. However, he was released instead of being deported. Then, he committed a second crime. He sexually assaulted an 11-year-old child in Carrboro. This time, ICE immediately asked local police to detain him, so he could be deported after his trial. But Orange County doesn’t honor ICE requests to detain illegal immigrants. They released him, the same way sanctuary cities do."" PolitiFact asked the Holding campaign to explain its claims about how the Orange County Sheriff’s Department handled the Aguilar-Castellanos case. Charles Hellwig, chairman of the Wake County GOP, responded on Holding’s behalf with several news stories about the case. He also provided a video of Coleman saying she supports sanctuary cities. The video, in which Coleman does indeed express support for sanctuary cities, was recorded during an April 23 candidate forum in Raleigh by the LGBTQ Democrats of Wake County, Hellwig said. First, let’s look at what happened to Aguilar-Castellanos. Holding’s ad says he was released. But it doesn’t mention anything about whether he was charged or convicted. Released, after jail time On June 27, Aguilar-Castellanos pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual battery involving an 11-year-old child and was required to register as a sex offender, The Herald-Sun reported. He was initially charged with felony indecent liberties with a child and felony second-degree kidnapping. However, The Herald-Sun reported, an agreement with prosecutors allowed Aguilar-Castellanos to plead guilty to the lesser charge and to be released immediately because he had served 293 days in jail awaiting trial. The maximum sentence he could have received for the sexual battery charges was 150 days, the paper reported. The time served by Aguilar-Castellanos isn’t mentioned in the Holding ad. That omission could leave some believing that he was never punished for his crime. So what did the Orange County Sheriff’s Department do that was ""like a sanctuary city?"" Sanctuary cities While there’s no formal definition of a sanctuary city, the term often refers to towns or cities that offer some protections to immigrants who are in the country without legal permission. In criminal cases, the local officials often refuse to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Policies and procedures vary by city and state. In NC, the law signed by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory in 2015 makes it illegal for cities or towns to block their police or sheriff’s departments from collaborating with ICE or other federal agencies. The law also forbids local governments from accepting consulate or embassy documents as a form of identification, WUNC reported. State designations aside, no NC town is considered a sanctuary city by the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring low levels of immigration. And no NC town was targeted by the U.S. Justice Department last year when it sent letters to 29 jurisdictions, questioning the legality of their policies for dealing with immigration authorities. However, according to The Herald-Sun and the Associated Press, Orange County Sheriff Charles Blackwood has said his office does not honor immigration detainers from ICE because it has concerns about potential civil rights lawsuits. That means it doesn’t hold immigrants in custody if there’s no warrant, or if they’re not serving a sentence. Orange County and ICE So the Orange County Sheriff’s department released Aguilar-Castellanos when he had completed his sentence on June 27, the same day he pleaded guilty. (Remember: He was sentenced to time-served.) ICE agents later arrested him in Georgia — and publicly complained about having to track him down. ICE said in a news release that Aguilar-Castellanos had been under a federal immigration judge’s removal order since January 2015. An immigration detainer also was issued to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office in September 2017 after his initial arrest, they said. The sheriff’s office said it attempted to contact ICE by phone, but that the effort was unsuccessful. In response to ICE’s public complaints, the Orange County Sheriff said that ICE could’ve assumed custody of Aguilar-Castellanos ""at any point"" during his nearly 300 days in custody. Our ruling Holding released a pair of campaign ads that say an illegal immigrant assaulted a child in Carrboro and that the Orange County Sheriff’s Office released him ""like a sanctuary city."" The ad doesn’t mention that the immigrant was convicted and completed his sentence. The Orange County jail did release the man. But the ad doesn’t mention that ICE had nearly 300 days to assume custody prior to his release. We rate this claim Half True.

Wooten leaves out some details about teacher pay cuts
","In a Facebook ad video that ran through the first week of October, Democratic state Senate candidate JD Wooten waded into one of North Carolina’s hottest topics for debate: teacher pay. ""Republicans in the General Assembly cut teacher pay so much when they took over in 2011 that even with recent pay raises, we are still below pre-Recession pay levels,"" said Wooten, who is running to unseat incumbent Rick Gunn in District 24, which includes Alamance County and part of Guilford County. Wooten’s statement made our ears perk up, so we decided to check it out. Is teacher pay in North Carolina still lower than it was before the Great Recession? And if so, is the Republican-controlled state legislature at fault? In short, Wooten is mostly correct that teacher pay has not returned to pre-recession levels. But he misses the mark on the political blame, as the biggest cuts actually came under Democratic leadership. How much money are teachers making? The average North Carolina public school teacher made $49,970 during the 2016-17 year and an estimated $50,861 in 2017-18, according to the National Education Association, the country’s biggest teachers union. The North Carolina Department of Public Instruction put its own estimate for 2017-18 slightly higher, at $51,214. Assuming these estimates hold true, last school year marked the first time the average teacher salary in North Carolina has exceeded $50,000, as The News & Observer previously reported. (Estimates for 2018-2019 have not yet been released.) As state Republicans are quick to point out, average teacher salaries have been trending up for several years. That positive momentum follows a years-long dip in the wake of the recession, which started in December 2007 and lasted through June 2009. Average teacher pay was $47,354 in 2007-08 and $48,648 in 2008-09, according to the NEA. So on first glance, it seems that average teacher pay have surpassed where it was before the recession hit. But as Wooten pointed out when we contacted him for comment, the NEA’s numbers have not been adjusted for inflation. This means that while their salaries might look like they have gotten bigger, teachers still have approximately $5,000 less in purchasing power than they did prior to the recession.  To see what Wooten meant, we ran each year’s estimate through the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator and found out their approximate value in today’s dollars. Here’s what we came up with: Academic year Average teacher pay Average teacher pay, adjusted for inflation 2007-08 $47,354 $55,606 2008-09 $48,648 $57,109 2009-10 $46,850 $53,591 2010-11 $46,605 $52,455 2011-12 $45,947 $50,245 2012-13 $45,737 $49,230 2013-14 $44,990 $47,673 2014-15 $47,819 $50,716 2015-16 $47,941 $50,157 2016-17 $49,970 $51,005 2017-18 $50,861 $50,861 As the table shows, the inflation-adjusted numbers — which could vary slightly, depending on how the calculations are performed — prove that Wooten’s claim about average teacher pay levels still trailing what they were before the recession is fairly accurate. It’s worth noting, however, that the inflation-adjusted numbers could be declining at some points for several reasons, and not just because teachers are being paid less. For example, it’s possible that many veteran teachers left the state, and the average teacher became less experienced. That may explain why, if you compare the salary schedules from 2008 and 2018, many pay levels are actually much higher for teachers now than then, even when adjusted for inflation.  Still, as far as averages go, Wooten is right that they have not returned to pre-recession levels. Republicans took control of the state legislature in 2011, when average teacher salaries were about $46,605, or approximately $52,455 in ""current"" dollars. That’s higher than the $50,861 that the NEA has estimated the average North Carolina teacher pocketed in 2017-18. Who is to blame? Wooten’s ad placed the blame squarely on the state’s Republicans, but in reality, both political parties have seen teacher pay rise and fall under their leadership in the last decade. Previously, PolitiFact gave Mostly False ratings to Gov. Roy Cooper and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for similar claims that also sought to pin the full blame on Republicans. As the timelines show, teacher pay had been rising before the recession hit. But it was Democratic Gov. Bev Perdue who, in 2009, ordered a 0.5 percent pay cut for all state employees, including teachers. That measure was approved by a Democrat-controlled legislature — which also voted to freeze teachers' salaries — and average teacher salaries continued to drop every year under Perdue. Teachers did not receive raises in 2010, either. Perdue held office through 2012, meaning Republicans dominated the legislature for the last two years of her term. In each of those years, Perdue vetoed the budget and insisted that more money be spent on education, but the budgets went through anyway.  When Perdue left office and Republican Gov. Pat McCrory took over in 2013, average teacher pay continued to go down, even after all state employees and teachers were given a 1.2 percent raise in 2012. Teacher pay fell to its lowest point during McCrory’s first year — the third year of the Republican-led legislature — when it dove below $45,000 in 2013-14. Republicans in the legislature did overhaul the education system in many ways, and some budget policies McCrory signed into law could have had an impact on teacher salaries. The 2013 budget, for example, eliminated a salary increase that went to teachers who earned a master’s degree. On the flip side, teachers can now get bonuses based on how their students perform on state exams, The News & Observer has previously reported. But since 2013, teacher pay has been trending upward. Although it has not yet returned to pre-recession levels, it is getting close. In 2016 under McCrory and in 2017 under Cooper, the GOP-controlled legislature approved budgets with teacher pay raises. In 2017, the legislature added a 6.5 percent average pay raise for teachers, the News & Observer reported. Previously, PolitiFact said it was Mostly True that teacher pay has increased each of the last five years under Republican leadership. Wooten did not make any mention in his ad of the role played by Democratic state leaders in the state’s low teacher pay, but he did acknowledge the Perdue administration’s cuts in an email explaining his statement.   ""While there were some initial pay reductions, adjusted for (consumer price index), during the final years of Democratic control of the (North Carolina General Assembly), it was due to the recession and was consistent with national averages and overall market reductions due to the economic contractions,"" he wrote. Wooten said his ad faulted Republicans because of the ""additional drastic cuts after the GOP took control."" For the record, it's also worth noting that state leaders are not entirely responsible for teacher pay, since many of the state's school districts provide teachers with additional pay supplements in addition to their state salaries. The NEA factors these supplements into its estimates. Our ruling Wooten said, ""Republicans in the General Assembly cut teacher pay so much when they took over in 2011 that even with recent pay raises, we are still below pre-Recession pay levels."" Wooten is correct that North Carolina’s teachers are still receiving salaries that are lower on average than what they were getting before the recession, when adjusted for inflation. He did not specify in his ad that he was talking about inflation-adjusted average teacher pay, which could have confused readers. More importantly, his attempt to pin the full blame for the state’s below-average teacher salaries on the GOP was misleading, as Democratic leaders were responsible for the heaviest teacher pay cuts in the wake of the recession. Since the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate this claim Mostly False.

Did Claire McCaskill say normal people can afford a private plane?
","Correction, Oct. 17, 2018: Initially, we published this fact-check with a rating of False, because based on the video available, it did not appear that McCaskill was talking about private planes. After publication, we received more complete video of the question-and-answer session between McCaskill and a constituent that showed she was in fact responding to a question about private planes, as well as a report describing the meeting. We re-assessed the evidence, archived the original version here, and published the version you see here with a new rating of Half True. We apologize for the error. Private planes have been a long-running headache for Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. In 2011, she sold a family owned private plane and repaid the federal government $88,000 for flights she paid for through her Senate office. Earlier this year, while running for a third term in a nip-and-tuck race, McCaskill took heat for using her current private plane to criss-cross portions of the state while she was supposedly on a three-day RV tour of the state. The Senate Leadership Fund — a pro-Republican super PAC with close ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — is seeking to remind voters about this history in an ad released Oct. 16. The ad takes aim at McCaskill’s ""high-flying lifestyle."" An animated plane labeled ""Air Claire"" leads the viewer through the ad, and the narrator cites investments by her husband in the Cayman Islands and reminds viewers of the money McCaskill repaid to the treasury for flights. At one point, the narrator says, ""Claire even said this about private planes."" The ad then shows footage of McCaskill saying, ""That normal people can afford it."" The narrator returns to ask, ""Normal people can afford a private plane?"" The ad concludes with the narrator saying, ""Multimillionaire Claire McCaskill: Way out of touch with Missouri."" Did McCaskill really say that ""normal people can afford"" private planes? She did, but the ad takes her literal words out of context. The remark occurred at an Aug. 19, 2017, town hall in Kennett, Mo., located in the state’s southeastern ""bootheel."" McCaskill was taking a question from Sam Jewell, the manager of Kennett Memorial Airport, who asked whether the federal air traffic system should be privatized. McCaskill responded that her answer was not at the moment, but she added that she hoped the privatization push would nudge the Federal Aviation Administration into long-needed upgrades of its radar system. (We’ve summarized her answer in this article, but you can read the full transcript here.)   Jewell responded, ""Well, when you go to any other country, you know the cost of flying — I just had a friend who went home to Greece and was trying to fly around over there, it costs like $500 just to go from one little city to the next, and you have to have credit cards on file for them to charge your account. You know, that’s one thing the United States has that nobody else has, is the freedom to fly around and be affordable where a normal person can afford it."" McCaskill then responded, ""Will you remind them when they come after me about my husband’s plane? That normal people can afford it?"" The crowd laughed. ""Yeah, but I understand the fear, and I understand the uncertainty, but I remain committed to trying to look at any solution we can find to get our stuff updated, but not at the expense of general aviation."" By showing her words in isolation, the Senate Leadership Fund exaggerates McCaskill’s remark. McCaskill was wrapping up a wonky discussion of federal aviation privatization with a constituent whose business depended heavily on the resolution of that issue. She was directly responding to Jewell’s remarks about a friend’s comparative experiences flying a private plane in the United States and Greece. She repeated Jewell’s words when she used the phrase ""normal people."" In context, these seem to refer to ""normal"" users of private planes, not to ""normal"" Americans more generally. In addition to snipping out Jewell’s lead-in comment, the ad also cut what followed McCaskill’s retort: laughter from the crowd. The McCaskill campaign said she was attempting to make a joke that elaborated on what the audience member said, and it appears at least some people listening took it that way. The Senate Leadership Fund says McCaskill ""even said this about private planes, ‘that normal people can afford it.’"" She said those words, but the footage in the ad leaves out both the lead-in comment that prompted McCaskill’s remark and the laughter that followed it. The full footage makes it clear that McCaskill was wrapping up a policy-heavy debate with a private-aviation manager and with a riff using the airport manager’s words. In context, he was referring to ""normal"" users of private planes, as opposed to ""normal"" Americans more generally.

Attack ad distorts McCready's position on tax cuts
","There are few voting blocs as coveted as the proverbial middle class. Politicians often boast about how their economic strategies are good for the middle class. Or they’ll say their opponent’s tax plans are bad for the middle class. A new ad by the Congressional Leadership Fund goes a step further while making a claim about Dan McCready, the Democrat facing Republican Mark Harris in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District. The ad, citing a recent Charlotte Observer editorial, criticizes McCready for dodging questions in a recent forum. The narrator then pivots. ""But McCready did admit he opposes middle class tax cuts,"" the narrator says. As the narrator speaks, the ad displays an image of a story about McCready that McClatchy newspapers published on June 5. Does the article back up the claim that McCready said he opposes tax cuts for the middle class? Not really. McCready was referring to his overall opposition to the tax plan. In fact, McCready says in the story he opposes the tax plan because it didn’t do enough to help the middle class. ""It took steps in the right direction, particularly in making American business more competitive,"" but ""did not cut taxes enough for the middle class,"" McCready is quoted as saying. The Trump tax cuts Contacted by PolitiFact, a spokesman for the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) noted that McCready opposed the tax plan approved by Republicans last year. Thus, the spokesman posited, McCready opposed tax cuts for the middle class. PolitiFact has written extensively about the tax plan, noting that most Americans will see cuts in the next few years. According to the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings, 90 percent of middle-income households would pay less in 2018. However, those savings largely disappear by 2027, except for the top 1 percent of earners. The CLF claim is similar to one made recently by Sen. Dean Heller, a Republican from Nevada. He claimed his opponent, Democrat Jacky Rosen, promised to ""repeal (the) middle-class tax cut."" Political groups like to paint opponents with a broad brush. Just because a candidate doesn’t support a bill doesn’t mean they oppose everything the bill does. McCready’s position McCready has repeatedly said he supports tax cuts for the middle class. He hopes to re-tool the Trump tax plan rather than repeal it, said Aaron Simpson, McCready’s deputy campaign manager. ""The first thing Dan would have done differently is make sure the tax cuts to the middle class is permanent. In addition, he believes we should have focused more on small business tax relief and making it easier to raise a family,"" Simpson said in an email to PolitiFact. McCready stated that position on his Facebook page in December and in a debate with Harris on Oct. 10. He said he supports the tax cuts in the Trump tax bill. ""But we needed to do much more of that: Give less of the tax cuts to the Warren Buffetts and Koch Brothers of the world and more to the hardworking teachers and firefighters that deserve a lot better here in North Carolina,"" McCready said. Our ruling The Congressional Leadership Fund ad says McCready admitted he opposes middle class tax cuts. They cited a story about the tax plan passed last year. In it, McCready specifically says the tax plan didn’t do enough to help the middle class. And McCready has repeatedly said he likes the middle class tax cuts in the Trump plan.

Did Indiana purge 20,000 voters in violation of a federal court order?
","Voter purges in Georgia and Ohio have captivated a national audience leading up to the midterms. Does Indiana face the same problem? ""Indiana Caught Illegally Purging 20,000 Voters – Are You One?"" was an Oct. 9 headline on Greg Palast’s blog read. Palast is a freelance investigative reporter who has been published in Rolling Stone and Al Jazeera. The subhead on his story claimed that Indiana has purged ""no less than 20,000 voters in violation of a federal court order."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Has Indiana taken tens of thousands of voters off their list in violation of a court order? The answer is complicated. Yes, Indiana has removed voters from its rolls -- but not in violation of a federal court order. An Indiana law passed in April 2017 would have allowed the state to kick thousands of voters off the voter registration list if a cross-state database known as the Interstate Crosscheck Program found what appeared to be duplicate voter registrations. But Indiana’s NAACP and League of Women Voters and Common Cause Indiana, a nonpartisan advocacy group, filed two separate lawsuits in August and October of 2017 challenging the removal of these voter registrations. They argued the process ignores critical safeguards before canceling voter registrations. The Interstate Crosscheck Program highlights voter records with matching names and birthdays across states. But researchers from Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania have found there is ""a surprisingly high chance that two ballots cast under the same first name, last name, and date of birth actually belong to two different people."" Following those two legal challenges, the court in June granted a preliminary injunction that stopped the law from going into effect. The state has appealed. A final ruling will not be made until after the election. The statewide voter registration system was never updated to implement the new law. After we contacted him, Palast modified his subhead to read that of the 20,000 that were purged, only ""some"" were ""apparently in violation of a federal court order."" Indiana has taken nearly 500,000 people off the voter roll since 2016, according to Jan Mensz, staff attorney at the ACLU of Indiana, which represented Common Cause in the suit. That’s about 10 percent of the 4.5 million registered voters. ""The fact that there have been a large number of voters removed since 2016 isn’t in itself that surprising,"" Mensz said. They may have moved, died, or been incarcerated, although that’s not always the case. After a Crosscheck list flagged 58,000 voter registrations as possible duplicates, election officials mailed those voters a postcard to confirm they still lived in Indiana. Of those, about 27,000 registrations were revoked. Palast found that 7,000 of them had moved. But the process the state used to kick these voters off the rolls would not have violated the court order. Voters can be ""legitimately and legally removed"" under a process by which the state first sends statewide mailers. If the postcard gets sent back as undeliverable, election officials wait until the voter hasn’t cast a ballot for two federal election cycles before taking the voter off the list. In fact, federal law requires that Indiana have a method to remove voters from the rolls, Mensz said. Indiana has been using the Crosscheck database for years as a catalyst to send out these mailers. The new law changed this so the state didn’t have to send a mailer or wait two election cycles before kicking a voter off the list; a Crosscheck match alone would do the trick. ""It’s our view that those removed by Crosscheck, with or without a postcard, doesn’t matter to us if they missed two elections, that's illegal and a violation of the National Voter Registration Act,"" Palast said. ""However, the subhed (which said the state violated the court order) was wrong."" Both lawsuits challenge Crosscheck as a basis for removal under any procedure, but the preliminary injunction order doesn’t grant that yet. No court has yet held the use of Crosscheck to be illegal in all circumstances. Palast said, ""Indiana has purged no less than 20,000 voters in violation of a federal court order."" Using data from the Indiana Office of Secretary of State, Palast found that roughly 20,000 Indiana voters were removed from the voting rolls in 2017 after their names matched an entry in the Crosscheck database. However, there is no evidence those removals violated a federal court order. The court order blocked a law from going into effect that would have used only the database to kick voters off the rolls. The voters Palast identified were first sent mailers and were given two federal election cycles to respond. That process has not yet been found illegal by any court.

Democratic Party delivers trade dig against Republican candidate Leah Vukmir via mail
","International trade has been at the forefront of American political discussion, from billions in tariffs levied in trade disputes to President Donald Trump announcing a replacement for NAFTA, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. In Wisconsin, it has created some strange connections. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat running for re-election, is touting her ‘Buy American’ legislation focused on infrastructure projects. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has backed Baldwin’s efforts. Meanwhile, Republican state Sen. Leah Vukmir -- Baldwin’s opponent -- has positioned herself as a stalwart Trump supporter, and has Trump’s endorsement. Yet in the midst of this comes a mailer from the Democratic Party of Wisconsin that states: ""Leah Vukmir OPPOSES Buy American."" What gives? The evidence The Democratic Party mailer features a photo of Baldwin wearing a hardhat while talking to a factory worker, and includes this quote: ""My Buy American legislation requires government infrastructure projects to use 100% American iron and steel. Because it’s time America buys what Wisconsin makes."" When asked to provide backup for the attack on Vukmir, a spokesman for the state party referred us to Baldwin campaign spokesman Bill Niedhardt. He, in turn, offered this critique: ""While Senator Baldwin and President Trump are both backing Buy American bills that support Wisconsin workers and businesses, Leah Vukmir is again siding instead with powerful special interests and the multinational corporations who are blocking these bills."" But Niedhardt did not offer any examples of specific votes or statements from Vukmir. That sent us back to the mailer, which included a footnote that pointed to a July 5, 2018, article in the Fond du Lac Reporter. The article was about a visit to the area by Baldwin to tout her ""Buy American"" measure. From the article: State Sen. Leah Vukmir, a Republican hoping to unseat the former congresswoman, said Baldwin’s proposed policy is not sustainable.

""She backs big-labor mandates and giveaways that drive up infrastructure costs for Wisconsin taxpayers,"" Vukmir said in a statement. ""We can’t build roads, no matter where the materials are from, if we can’t afford them in the first place."" When we asked Vukmir’s team for more information on her position,a spokesman simply referred us back to the statement quoted in the Fond du Lac Reporter article. So, we looked for additional evidence. Earlier in the campaign, Vukmir  said Baldwin ""claims to support a 'Buy America' philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words."" That framework would suggest Vukmir is pro-Buy American. But really, it focuses on Baldwin (Incidentally, we rated that claim False.) At an Oct. 8, 2018 debate at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the subject of Buy American legislation was raised during a discussion on trade and tariffs. Baldwin touted her Buy American legislation, saying its passage would be ""a step in the right direction.""  Vukmir was not asked about the measure, and didn’t comment on it. She did say Trump ""believes in fair trade as do I."" But that is off point as well. Meanwhile, we found that a ""Made in America"" bill was introduced by state Sen. Dave Hansen, D-Green Bay, in 2013 as SB 88, in 2015 as SB 176 SB and in 2017 as SB 240. From the bill description: Under this bill, with limited exceptions, the state must purchase materials that are manufactured to the greatest extent in the United States, regardless of whether all other factors are substantially equal. The bill also requires, with limited exceptions, that a contract for a public works or public improvement project must contain a provision requiring the contractor to use materials that are manufactured in the United States. The bill also creates a similar provision for local governments. Tony Palese, a spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse noted Senate Democrats tried in 2015 to include the bill as an amendment to the state budget. The amendment was defeated 19-14, with the vote tally showing Vukmir voted to table the proposal. That is, to block it from being added to the budget. While Vukmir has not articulated her opposition, some clues can be found in the debate over Baldwin’s bill. An April 21, 2017 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted ""Buy America"" provisions have historically drawn support from both parties. The article went on to note: ""But in Congress, Democrats are generally united in support of them. The other two lead sponsors of Baldwin’s bill are Democrats Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, are more divided.

Austin mayoral hopeful says 60 percent of Austin's waterways deemed unsafe to swim
","One of six candidates challenging Austin Mayor Steve Adler in the November 2018 election said that more than half of Austin’s waterways are so dirty, they’re deemed ""unsafe to swim."" The splashy claim by pedicabbie Alexander Strenger appears among entries on an E.thepeople interactive website showing questions to Texans running for office and responses. Question: ""What is your top environmental concern and how would you address it?"" Strenger’s reply: ""60% of our waterways are found to be contaminated with fecal matter and deemed unsafe to swim."" Strenger then suggested that dog owners who fail to clean up are mostly to blame and said that as mayor, he’d step up police presence near bodies of water to ensure more owners get fined. Candidate cites news story By email, Strenger told us he based his statement on an August 2018 Austin American-Statesman news story. The story said that according to a study by the Environment Texas Research and Policy Center, ""60 percent of Austin waterways tested last year were so contaminated with fecal matter as to be unsafe for swimming."" Not that Austinites were told to ditch their swimsuits. Popular swimming destinations such as Barton Springs Pool, Barton Creek, Lake Travis, Lake Austin and Walter E. Long Lake did not test positive for unsafe bacteria at any point in 2017, the story said. On the icky side, Austin’s Waller Creek, Walnut Creek, West Bouldin Creek, East Bouldin Creek and Blunn Creek frequently had unsafe levels of worrisome bacteria, the story citing the study said. Colorado River test sites east of Lady Bird Lake were found to have high levels of bacteria two out of the four times they were tested, the story said. According to the story, the researchers ""cited stormwater runoff as a cause for some of the biological pollution and recommended that cities require infrastructure improvements to mitigate runoff, such as permeable pavement. They also urged cities to educate residents about bacteria pollution caused by pet waste."" Todd Jackson, a field biologist with the city’s watershed department, told the newspaper that the most likely culprit for bacterial contamination was aging infrastructure, including hard-to-spot leaks in residential and commercial utility lines in older urbanized areas. Figures supported by study We dog-paddled to the study, ""Swim at Your Own Risk,"" which says that researchers found that 46 of 76 Austin sites, nearly 61 percent, had at least one 2017 water sample showing excessive bacteria levels--indicating unsafe conditions for swimming, tubing or wading safely. The samples are taken quarterly or less by the City of Austin’s Watershed Protection Department. Water ""samples were listed as unsafe for swimming if they exceeded levels of bacteria deemed safe for swimming by Texas regulation,"" the study says. For freshwater, the study says, ""safety is determined by counts of the bacteria E. coli. These bacteria, while they are not typically dangerous for humans, are used as indicators of fecal contamination, which can contain bacteria that make people sick,"" the study says. An accompanying chart shows that on each of the four days that samples were taken from two creeks, Blunn and East Bouldin, one site or more showed too much E. coli to be considered safe for swimming. Negative results were less consistent for the river and three other creeks, the chart indicates.  SOURCE: Study, ""Swim at Your Own Risk, Bacteria Pollution in Texas Beaches and Waterways Threatens Public Health,"" Environment Texas Research & Policy Center, August 2018 (fetched Oct. 11, 2018) An alternate interpretation To our inquiry, Luke Metzger of Environment Texas sent a spreadsheet by email showing the number of times each sampling showed higher-than-acceptable levels of E. coli. The sheet enabled us to speculate about a less dramatic read of the results. That is, just nine of the Austin sites, 12 percent, showed excessive E. coli at every sampling from the year. Metzger replied that he wouldn’t call that an all-clear to dive in. If ""there's a problem even once during the year, there's a risk that people could get sick swimming or wading,"" Metzger said. ""Just like Russian roulette, just because you don't die when it lands on an empty chamber doesn't make it a safe game to play."" City of Austin says about half of creeks contain too much dangerous bacteria Next, we asked city and state water experts to speak to the study’s judgment about the swimmability of Austin waterways. A city spokeswoman, Susan Garnett, said that at any given time, about half of Austin’s creeks exceed the state’s bacteria threshold for ""contact recreation,"" meaning an activity such as splashing or swimming that increases a person’s chances of swallowing water. That conclusion, she said, ties to samplings taken from about 125 sites in 45 watersheds over the past 30 years or so. Garnett said by email: ""The higher the E. coli count, the more likely there is fecal contamination and the higher the risk there is for waterborne illness. Any natural body of water will have some amount of fecal matter due to fish and wildlife, and the fecal matter from warm-blooded animals such as birds, bats, dogs, deer and other mammals will include E. coli."" Garnett’s 50 percent figure comports with what the city told the American-Statesman for an August 2014 news story quoting a city environmental engineer, Chris Herrington, estimating that half the city's watersheds had excessive levels of E. coli. Four Austin creeks were seen to be exceeding the state limit of 126 colonies per 100 milliliters of water (a method of gauging bacteria)--a level at which about eight out of 1,000 swimmers would have increased risks for gastroenteritis and offshoot aches and illnesses, the story said. Yet officials also pointed out that with the creeks often running shallow, it was almost impossible to fully immerse in the waters. Herrington said then that the state thresholds are ""protective and very conservative."" Exceeding them, he said, ""doesn't mean an immediate health risk."" State spokesman: Five impaired Austin-area waterways in 2014 By email, TCEQ spokesman Andrew Keese responded that in 2014, the latest year analyzed in a commission report, the agency found five of 53 Austin-area waterways, accounting for 13 percent of the area’s ""stream miles,"" to be impaired. Each waterway had enough E. coli over multiple samplings to represent ""an elevated level of risk of illness from contact recreation,"" Keese said. Still, Keese said, that didn’t ""necessarily indicate areas considered unsafe to swim. Swimming in all natural waters (including those that meet water quality standards) comes with risk, whether that be from pathogen exposure or other risks,"" Keese wrote. Keese noted that the Environment Texas study relied on single samplings in one year while the agency makes determinations based on 20 samplings over several years which, Keese wrote, ""provides a better overall assessment of risks associated with recreational activities such as swimming."" Keese went on: ""Bacteria data can be quite variable from day to day, and results are dependent upon a number of factors, such as antecedent precipitation."" Commission officials also said through Keese that the study appeared to consider samples from some waterways and not others--notably Austin’s Bull Creek. We turned back to Brian Zabcik of Environment Texas, who said that the study’s consideration of a few water samples taken in 2017 was a deliberate effort to spotlight what the state’s long-term approach could obscure. By email, Zabcik said the researchers didn’t field Bull Creek results because the city samples water from that creek in even-numbered years. Zabcik further quoted Andrew Clamann, a city environmental scientist, advising: ""There are too many watersheds in Austin to monitor them all every year."" Another perspective For out-of-Austin perspective, we reached the Meadows Center for Water and the Environment at Texas State University, which is working with the city and the Shoal Creek Conservancy to develop a watershed protection plan for Austin’s Shoal Creek Watershed. Nick Dornak, the center’s director of watershed services, said by email that statewide, the majority of monitored streams don’t meet their ""designated use,"" as defined by TCEQ, ""due to high levels of bacteria and other contaminants. Other common impairments include high levels of dissolved solids (salts) and depressed dissolved oxygen."" Dornak, asked to assess the Environment Texas study and TCEQ’s response, said: ""The study looked at a ‘snapshot’ of water quality and represented a kind of worst-case scenario that may be a little misleading."" Still, Dornak wrote, this ""data does show that there are definitely days where swimming may not be safe around Austin-area streams."" Our ruling Strenger said 60 percent of Austin’s ""waterways are found to be contaminated with fecal matter and deemed unsafe to swim."" This claim fairly echoes a study finding that 60 percent of Austin waterways sampled by the city had so much E. coli bacteria that swimming could pose health risks. Then again, the study indicates a smaller share of waterways, 12 percent, had too much of the bacteria at every sampling. It’s worth noting too that the samplings were all taken in 2017, a year ago. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Marco Rubio wrong about Andrew Gillum's response to 2016 hurricane in Tallahassee
","As northern Florida recovers from Hurricane Michael, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., portrayed Democrat Andrew Gillum as ineffective in helping his city of Tallahassee recover from a hurricane in 2016. Rubio leveled his charges in front of a group of supporters of Gillum’s rival for governor, Republican Ron DeSantis, in West Miami on Oct. 15. ""When they had a hurricane up there, they didn’t have power for weeks because he stood in the way of crews being able to come in and restore power, because they weren’t members of the right union or something,"" Politico reported Rubio as saying. Javier Manjarres, a conservative writer, captured Rubio’s comments on video. Rubio’s claims are inaccurate, and we’ll explain why one by one. Rubio’s spokeswoman did not respond. Rubio exaggerated the length of the power outage. The Sept. 1, 2016, storm took out the vast majority of Tallahassee’s power. The outage left more than 75,000 customers of the city's municipal electric system and 20,000 customers of the nearby cooperative electric company, Talquin Electric. Tallahassee residents complained about the restoration pace on social media. But a nearly 400-page Leon County report about Hurricane Hermine response months later showed most people received power within one week. The report stated that by Sept. 7 ""electrical service was restored to approximately 90 percent of city customers and nearly all Talquin customers in Leon County, significantly ahead of the estimated schedule that both agencies communicated to the public."" The county report stated that nearly all city customers were restored by Sept. 9, ""with remaining outages generally associated with damage to customers’ service lines that connect an individual meter to the pole."" The state emergency response team tweeted that 2 percent of Tallahassee customers had no power as of Sept. 8, 2016. This statement by Rubio echoes a Mostly False claim by the Republican Party of Florida. It isn’t true that Gillum blocked utilities from assisting with the storm recovery. After the storm hit, Eric Silagy, Florida Power and Light CEO, said he had 575 personnel ready to help. But Rob McGarrah, the city’s general manager of utilities, was confident the city had engaged enough assistance from eight other utilities, the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald reported after the storm. He did not immediately jump on the offer by FPL and said that coordination with the visiting crews was important to ""make sure what we're doing is safe."" The city of Tallahassee is not a strong mayor form of government in which a mayor operates much like a CEO of a company. It wasn’t up to Gillum or city commissioners to accept or reject help from various utilities; that decision was in McGarrah’s hands. There is no evidence that the city based any decisions about utilities based on union affiliation, despite what Rubio and DeSantis have claimed. Rubio’s suggestion that Gillum, a Democrat, only wanted union help makes no sense based on what actually happened. City workers helping to restore power were not unionized — and they still aren’t, Jamie Van Pelt, chief of staff of Gillum’s mayoral office, told PolitiFact. Meanwhile, Florida Power & Light employs unionized crews and also works with both union and non-union contract personnel, said company spokesman Mark Bubriski. Barry Moline, who coordinated with other utilities at the time in his role as the head of the Florida Municipal Electrical Association, said he didn’t know about the union status of Tallahassee electric lineworkers, either then or now. ""It has NEVER been an issue when I have chosen lineworkers to assist utilities for any restoration, including the Hermine restoration in Tallahassee,"" Moline told PolitiFact. ""I never took that information into consideration and no one ever asked me to do so."" In a Facebook post days after the 2016 storm, Gillum addressed rumors that the city was turning down help based on political motivations. ""It appears that the heat has driven some to speculate wildly about what help I have accepted or rejected on behalf of the City in our effort to recuperate from this storm. Some have suggested that I have refused help from any company that is not unionized. Others have stated that I have refused help offered by any Republicans. And still others have suggested a machiavellian attempt by me to surrender residents to my will by prolonging suffering and delaying any power from being restored - rendering them utterly helpless to my liberal agenda,"" he said, adding in an emoji with a frown. Gillum continued: ""Let me be clear. We are happy to accept any help from any person or organization that is going to accelerate the speed at which we can safely restore power to our residents."" Rubio said after Hurricane Hermine in 2016, Tallahassee ""didn’t have power for weeks because (Gillum) stood in the way of crews being able to come in and restore power, because they weren’t members of the right union or something."" The vast majority of Tallahassee customers had power within a week, according to a county report, a state office and media reports at the time. There is no evidence that Gillum rejected an offer of help to restore power based on union or political concerns. The decision about whether to accept help from various utilities was in the hands of the city’s general manager of utilities. Rubio’s storm of concern does not have the facts to back it up.

Democrats attack Rep. Mimi Walters on health care vote, insurance interest donations
","It wasn’t that long ago that Republicans were attacking Democrats for supporting the Affordable Care Act. Now, it’s Democrats who are taking the offensive and attacking Republicans for their efforts to repeal the ACA, also known as Obamacare. The latest target: Rep. Mimi Walters, a California Republican representing an Orange County district that backed Hillary Clinton in 2016. A new TV attack ad by the House Majority PAC, a group aligned with Democrats, claims that ""Walters took big bucks from insurance interests,"" with an image on screen saying Walters took $213,000 from the insurance industry. The ad also claims that Walters supported a health care plan that ""strips protections for people living with pre-existing conditions and slaps an age tax on older Californians,"" and that Walters voted with Trump 99 percent of the time. We fact-checked whether Walters voted 99 percent of the time with Trump in a separate fact-check. Here, we’ll take on the claims about Walters’ ties to insurance interests, and her votes to strip protections for people with pre-existing conditions and whether she supported an ""age tax."" What we found is that the ad is slightly misleading on the amount insurance donations Walters has received, and overstates what it describes as an ""age tax."" Walters did not respond to a request for comment. The pre-existing conditions and age tax portion of the ad is in reference to Walters’ 2017 vote to repeal President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, often shorthanded as Obamacare, and to replace it with the American Health Care Act. (The AHCA passed the House but ultimately failed in the Senate.) Obamacare prohibits insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, a provision that had been threatened by Republican efforts to repeal the law. Under Obamacare, if you don’t have health insurance through an employer or the government, you have guaranteed access to coverage in the individual market, regardless of your health status, and you can’t be billed higher rates for a pre-existing medical condition. Under the GOP’s American Health Care Act, it would have kept the requirement that people with pre-existing conditions must be offered health insurance – but it would have dropped Obamacare’s rules capping how much extra those people could be charged. In short, insurers would have been required to offer everyone a plan, but insurers would have more control over how much they could charge. Experts say that would have effectively priced many people living with pre-existing conditions out of the insurance market. When Republicans claimed that the AHCA would not threaten coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, we rated those claims Mostly False. The ad also claims that Walters’ vote for the AHCA imposes an ""age tax"" on older Californians. The bill would have allowed insurers to hike premiums for certain older enrollees from up to five times more than what they would charge younger adults. The current law, Obamacare, sets that cap at up to three times as much. The legislation also would have allowed states to set a different ratio. The ""age tax"" also doesn’t apply to seniors on Medicare, or to people over the age of 50 with medical covered sponsored by large employers. It is important to note, though, that it would impact people in the 50-64 age range who weren’t covered by an employer as they are not yet eligible for Medicare. The ad claims that Mimi Walters took $213,000 from insurance interests, citing the Center for Responsive Politics, an authoritative database that tracks campaign finance. In the report, the CRP found that Walters received $213,575 from the insurance industry from 2013 to 2018. In the 2017-18 election cycle, she has received $68,500.   There's an important caveat to this number, however. While the ad is talking about health care, the Center for Responsive Politics says it groups donations from health, life, property and car insurance companies, agents and brokers in its totals. The ad may leave viewers with the wrong idea that all the donations were related to health care, or that somehow those donations influenced her vote. There is no evidence of that. The House Majority PAC says that Mimi Walters received $213,000 from insurance interests in her campaign for Congress, and claims she supports a plan that strips health care for people with pre-existing conditions and imposes an age tax on senior Californians. It is accurate that Walters supported legislation that would have likely resulted in less coverage for those with previous medical conditions and hiked premiums for older enrollees. Though calling the vote an ""age tax"" is misleading. Walters did take in over $213,000 from the insurance industry. But that was over five years and includes donations from property and car insurers.
