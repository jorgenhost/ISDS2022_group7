Cordray on point about increase in firearm deaths in Ohio
","Richard Cordray, a Democrat who has supported gun rights in the past, is playing defense during the Ohio primary for governor on his position on guns. Cordray received an A grade from the NRA and was endorsed by the Buckeye Firearms Association in 2010 when he ran for Ohio Attorney General. But during this campaign he has stated his support for some changes to gun laws, including universal background checks and raising the age to purchase a firearm to 21 in Ohio. One of his May 8 primary opponents, Dennis Kucinich, has portrayed Cordray as soft on guns and attacked him for helping a gun-rights group hold a rally in 2010. On his 2018 campaign website, Cordray has raised concerns about homicide and suicide gun deaths. ""The numbers are truly alarming,"" Cordray wrote, and then cited a series of statistics about gun violence including this one: ""Since 1999, firearm deaths in Ohio have risen 58 percent."" Cordray is correct about the increase in firearm deaths in Ohio since 1999. Although he didn’t address the reasons behind the increase, we will explain some of the evidence about the increase. Cordray’s campaign pointed to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing the increase in firearm deaths. There were 8.28 firearm deaths per 100,000 residents in Ohio in 1999 rising to 13.12 in 2016 -- an increase of 58 percent. There was an increase in both the rate of firearm deaths in suicides and homicides. Firearm death data Ohio in 1999 Ohio in 2016 Rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 8.28 13.12 Sheer number of firearm deaths 939 1,524   Cordray used a CDC set of data that started in 1999. But if we looked back a few years earlier in the 1990s, we found a higher rate of firearm deaths -- for example 11.73 in 1991. So if Cordray had drawn on a comparison from an earlier year in the 1990s, it wouldn’t show as much of a contrast as comparing 1999 and 2016. Why gun deaths have increased in Ohio is the more difficult question to answer -- something that Cordray didn’t comment about on his website. Randolph Roth, co-founder of the Historical Violence Database at Ohio State University, told PolitiFact that there has been a tremendous surge in homicides in recent years in Ohio’s major cities. The year 2016 was Cleveland’s deadliest year in a decade. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that Cleveland's uptick in homicides was particularly significant but continued an upward trend that began in 2014 and intensified in 2015. Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, pointed to the opioid crisis as a factor in the increase in homicides in Ohio. Using CDC data, he showed that the increases in firearm deaths are primarily in the midwest and Ohio. ""The opioid increase is disproportionately concentrated in the midwest and also concentrated among whites,"" Rosenfeld told PolitiFact. Rosenfeld elaborated on that point in a 2017 paper for the National Institute of Justice in which he called for more research on the causes behind the homicide rise. Jim Irvine, a volunteer with the Buckeye Firearms Association, noted that CDC data shows an increase in suicides overall and that ""guns are one of several methods/tools used."" CDC data shows that the rate of suicides both by firearms -- and without firearms -- increased between 1999 and 2016 in Ohio. The Buckeye Firearms Association hasn’t endorsed in the Democratic primary but did endorse Attorney General Mike DeWine in the Republican primary. The association endorsed Cordray for Attorney General when he ran against DeWine in 2010. Cordray said on his website that ""since 1999, firearm deaths in Ohio have risen 58 percent."" Data from the Centers for Disease Control showed that there were 8.28 firearm deaths per 100,000 residents in Ohio in 1999 rising to 13.12 in 2016 -- an increase of 58 percent. Firearm deaths in suicides and homicides increased. If Cordray had selected an earlier year in the 1990s, the contrast would not have been as extreme when there was a higher rate of firearm deaths. However, his comparison of 1999 and 2016 is one valid way to examine the data.

Does Gov. Rick Scott want to privatize Social Security?
","The president of a PAC that works to protect Social Security says Florida Gov. Rick Scott doesn’t have the backs of senior citizens. Jon ""Bowzer"" Bauman, the president of the Social Security Works PAC (and a former member of the band Sha Na Na), blasted Scott in a press release April 9 after the term-limited governor announced his run for U.S. Senate against Democrat incumbent Bill Nelson. ""Rick Scott wants to destroy Social Security by privatizing it,"" he said. ""That would be a disaster for the 1.7 million Florida seniors who would be living in poverty without Social Security."" The claim that Republicans want to privatize Social Security is a line we’ve heard from Democrats for more than a decade. A lot of the time, the remark is an exaggeration of the GOP candidates' positions, but we wanted to see if there was any truth to the claim about Scott. The evidence provided by Social Security Works is not based on Scott’s current position. The group’s evidence for this claims stems from interviews and actions he took as governor in 2011 and remarks from back in 1994. And in all of those instances, Scott never explicitly says he wants to privatize Social Security. Scott does not have position pages for his Senate campaign yet and has not made recent comments about Social Security. Scott’s spokeswoman, Kerri Wyland hinted that Scott would protect Social Security when we asked about his current stance.  ""Gov. Scott maintains his belief that Washington must change the way it operates, and that includes making sure it isn’t spending more money than it takes in – but it shouldn’t be done on the backs of the Social Security system that so many seniors rely on,"" Wyland said. We also checked an archived version of Scott’s campaign website from 2010 to see if there was anything suggesting he supported privatizing Social Security, but we came up empty-handed. So, what gives? As evidence of this claim, Social Security Works pointed to news clippings and transcripts from Scott’s past. But in these instances, Scott was vague. In a 2011 interview on CNBC with Andrew Ross Sorkin, Sorkin asked if Scott preferred Social Security to be privatized. ""Here’s what I want to do. In our state, what I want to do, I want everybody in a 401(k),"" Scott said. In 2011, Scott signed a pledge to urge senators and members of the House of Representatives to oppose any debt limit increase until conditions were met. The pledge — known as the ‘Cut, Cap, and Balance’ pledge — echoed legislation being considered by lawmakers. Entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid account for a large share of the federal budget, so one way to limit debt increases is to reduce spending for those programs. Before the legislation’s signing, the founder of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorites released a statement saying that ""the legislation would inexorably subject Social Security and Medicare to deep reductions."" The other two examples provided by Social Security Works rely on remarks from 1994.  An Orlando Sentinel article from 2010 said that Scott once urged privatizing Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Administration. According to the article, Scott told USA Today the programs would be better off in the hands of profit-seeking companies. ""Let us make a profit. So what?"" he said in 1994. He went on to make a stronger statement about the Veterans Administration hospitals that same year.   ""If you look at how the government runs VA hospitals and Medicare and Medicaid, you can see that the whole system is inefficient,"" Scott told the South Florida Business Journal the same year. ""The things we are doing wrong in health care can be corrected if private business could run national health care administration."" While the comments do suggest that Scott may have supported elements of privatization for Medicaid, Medicare and the VA, they do not touch on Social Security. Social Security Works also pointed to the fact that Scott’s running mate in 2010 — Jennifer Carroll — supported ""partial privatization"" of Social Security. But that doesn’t mean that Scott himself shared her view. In a candidate questionnaire published by the Orlando Sentinel, in November 2000, Jennifer Carroll wrote, ""If younger workers are allowed to invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in their own retirement accounts, over the long run, they will have far more in their pension funds -- by their own efforts -- than any government Social Security pension fund could hope to provide."" We reached out to several experts to get their take on the evidence that Social Security Works provided. None of the experts we spoke to were completely convinced Scott’s remarks translated to privatization. Andrew G. Biggs, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, called the evidence from Social Security Works ""incredibly weak."" ""Supporting reducing Social Security spending to restore solvency isn’t privatization, nor is favoring that everyone be signed up for a 401(k),"" Biggs said. ""401(k)s are private accounts outside of Social Security and have nothing to do with privatization."" Brookings Institution economist Henry Aaron, called the evidence circumstantial, but said the remarks about Medicare, Medicaid and the VA system do indicate that Scott is in the same philosophical camp area as those who advocate for privatization. He also said the fact that Scott has not taken a position on Social Security ""strongly suggests that he is not enamored with the program."" ""How on earth would a politician who is seeking votes ever choose to be silent about the most popular program the federal government runs in a state with more of the people that program serves than any other state in the nation unless one was less critical of it?"" he asked. The Social Security Works PAC president said Scott ""wants to destroy Social Security by privatizing it."" The majority of the evidence provided by Social Security Works stems from remarks Scott made as governor in 2011 and earlier when he was still the CEO of the hospital chain Columbia/HCA. At best, the evidence suggests Scott shares some of sentiments as those who support privatization, but that doesn’t mean he has a plan to privatize Social Security. In fact, Scott does not have a publicly available position on the issue. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/apr/12/jon-bowzer-bauman/does-gov-rick-scott-want-privatize-social-security/

Arizona Democratic Party claims GOP lawmaker McSally voted to sell internet users' data. Is it true?
","The Arizona Democratic Party is putting Republican Congresswoman Martha McSally under the spotlight as a national conversation unfolds about internet privacy and the unauthorized sharing of user data. ""Congresswoman Martha McSally voted to let companies sell your internet data to the highest bidder without your consent. Then she got paid $42,000 by the very corporations she allowed to sell your personal info,"" claimed the Arizona Democratic Party on a marthamcsally.forsale website. The website lists different types of personal information ""exposed by Rep. McSally,"" including Social Security number, credit card numbers, children’s information, smartphone app data and internet browsing history. McSally is vying for the Senate seat vacated by Sen. Jeff Flake, who is retiring when his term ends early January 2019. Other Republicans also running are Sheriff Joe Arpaio and former Arizona state senator Kelli Ward. The primary election is Aug. 28. Did McSally vote ""to let companies sell"" internet data without users’ consent and ""got paid $42,000"" by the corporations allowed to sell such data? The Arizona Democratic Party’s claim has some elements of truth, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. McSally voted to repeal internet data rules that had not taken effect. Her vote was not ""to let"" companies sell data (they were already legally allowed to do that); it was to halt new rules requiring companies to seek users’ explicit consent before doing so. Companies don’t generally sell internet data, they rather sell access to users by allowing advertisers to target specific demographics, telecommunications experts told PolitiFact. McSally ""got paid $42,000"" by corporations allowed to sell users’ personal information? The Arizona Democratic Party bases this claim on campaign contributions McSally received after the March 28 vote. Federal Election Commission data shows that political action committees for telecommunications companies and their employees donated about $42,000 to McSally’s campaign or an affiliated political action committee. McSally’s campaign spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair called the Arizona Democratic Party’s claim ""absurd and offensive."" ""This rule favored organizations like Facebook. It gave them more access to data than other companies, and did nothing to protect Arizonans' information from them,"" Sinclair said. Congress, including McSally, in March 2017 voted to get rid of internet privacy rules the Federal Communications Commission created during the Obama administration. They were scheduled to take effect December 2017 under the Trump administration. The rules were intended to give consumers more control over how internet service providers (ISPs), such as Verizon or Comcast, used their data. They required ISPs to obtain explicit information from their customers before using and sharing their web browsing history and other ""sensitive information,"" such as Social Security numbers, precise geolocation data and financial or health information. (Facebook is not an ISP, so the new rules didn’t apply to Facebook.) Arizona’s Flake challenged the rules under the Congressional Review Act of 1996, arguing that Obama’s FCC went too far and that internet privacy issues have been under the FTC’s purview, not the FCC’s. The vote removed the FCC’s authority to regulate the sale of consumer data, said Nicol Turner Lee, a fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings Institution. This part of Arizona Democratic Party’s claim ignores several key facts. Before the vote, companies were already legally allowed to sell internet data, but were not doing so to begin with, experts said. ""The new privacy rules for broadband internet access service providers hadn’t gone into effect so, practically speaking, data collection practices remained the same,"" said Brent Skorup, a senior research fellow in the Technology Policy Program at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. The main issue involved ""de-identified"" browsing data (data that cannot reasonably be linked to a particular consumer, computer, or device) and whether it was considered sensitive when broadband internet access service providers had it, Skorup said. ""The Obama FTC in 2012 said no, de-identified browsing data isn’t sensitive; the Obama FCC in 2016 said yes, it is sensitive,"" Skorup said. ""Congresswoman McSally’s vote was, effectively, a vote to restore the Obama FTC’s privacy policies and halt the Obama FCC’s proposed policies."" Skorup emphasized that ISPs cannot and could not collect sensitive user data — such as health information, financial information, children’s information, Social Security numbers, and geolocation information — without express consumer consent. The vote caused Americans to lose whatever potential privacy rights they would have and should’ve had, said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit advocating for consumers on digital privacy and consumer protection issues. Yet internet service providers aren’t selling or giving users’ data to advertisers, Chester said. They keep the data and use it to deliver targeted ads, he said. ""It’s not about selling your data, it’s about selling access to you,"" Chester said. Information generally isn’t sold by ISPs, but rather those seeking to advertise could go to ISPs with a demographic they are hoping to target, and ISPs could then use either aggregate or otherwise anonymized data to send advertisements to the right groups of people, said Doug Brake, director of telecom policy at Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank. ""The FTC has detailed guidelines on the types of consent that are necessary for different types of data, with more sensitive data requiring express opt-in consent. … From what we know, ISP policies are all consistent with FTC guidelines, and they remained in place through the passing and repeal of the Obama-era FCC rules,"" Brake said. (Cox Communications and other internet providers, issued statements after the vote saying they do not sell personally identifiable information or web browsing history.) The Arizona Democratic Party based this claim on contributions made after the March vote to McSally’s campaign by political action committees tied to telecommunications companies and their employees. (Federal law generally prohibits corporations from making contributions to candidates for federal offices.) The Arizona Democratic Party pointed to a March National Journal article citing data from the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance data at OpenSecrets.org. ""Over the course of her career, McSally has taken nearly $100,000 in campaign contributions from sources such as AT&T, Verizon, and Cox Communications, all of whom provide internet services,"" the article said. Specifically after the vote, Federal Election Commission filings show McSally received $37,000 in such contributions and that Comcast contributed an additional $5,000 to a political action committee affiliated with McSally, the National Journal reported. Contributors to McSally for Congress since the March vote include Cox Enterprises PAC, Verizon Communications Inc. Political Action Committee, and Comcast Corporation & NBCUniversal Political Action Committee. The Arizona Democratic Party launched a website that claimed, ""Congresswoman Martha McSally voted to let companies sell your internet data to the highest bidder without your consent. Then she got paid $42,000 by the very corporations she allowed to sell your personal info."" McSally’s vote did not allow companies to sell internet data — that was already legally allowed. Still, experts said companies generally don’t sell data to third parties such as advertisers, rather use the data to deliver companies’ ads. McSally’s campaign received about $42,000 after the March vote from political action committees tied to telecommunications companies. McSally also received contributions from those groups prior to the vote.

Anonymous caller warns of local police arresting you about your taxes unless you call back soon
","A phone message from a New York area code about ""your tax filings"" ominously indicated that if the Texas recipient didn’t call back soon, jail time and legal action loomed. By all indications, though, the message fielded April 10, 2018 by an Austin resident from a number with the 607 area code was a scam. Significantly, agencies say, anyone getting such a call should hang up and consider filing a complaint with an independent arm of the U.S. Treasury. Warning message We transcribed the warning, which was left as a voice mail on a cell phone with a number starting with the 512 area code. In the message, an automated voice said: ""We have received a notification regarding your tax filings from the headquarters which will get expired in next 24 working hours. And once it gets expired after that, you will be taken into custody by the local cops as there are more serious allegations pressed on your name at this moment. We would request you to get back to us so that we can discuss about this case before taking any legal action against you."" Federal agency battles criminal callers Next, we hunted for governmental guidance about such calls. In a March 2016 press release, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration stressed that if the IRS wants a taxpayer’s attention, the first contact is generally through the U.S. mail. Also, the IRS ""will not ask for payment using a prepaid debit card, a money order or a wire transfer. The IRS also will not ask for a credit card number or your bank information over the phone,"" TIGTA said. At the time, TIGTA said it had fielded reports of some 5,500 victims collectively paying about $29 million ""as a result of the scam in which criminals make unsolicited calls to taxpayers fraudulently claiming to be IRS officials and demanding that they send them cash via prepaid debit cards, money orders or wire transfers from their banks."" In December 2017, TIGTA issued a fresh release stating that from October 2013 through mid-November 2017, more than 2.1 million taxpayers reported receiving phone contacts from scammers--with over 12,400 victims collectively reporting payments of more than $61.6 million due to the scam. The TIGTA inspector general, J. Russell George, said in the release that such scammers ""are only succeeding with a handful of victims. On average, between 30 and 40 new victims each week report that they paid the impersonators money. This is a vast improvement over the hundreds of new victims who were reporting last year that they paid the impersonators money."" When we emailed our transcript of the April 2018 phone message to TIGTA, spokeswoman Karen Kraushaar replied by email: ""TIGTA has made many arrests in connection with this scam and has numerous investigations underway. To date, as a result of our efforts, a total of 111 individuals have been charged in federal court for their involvement in IRS impersonation scam activity.  Even so, we are still receiving reports that between 4,000 and 10,000 taxpayers are receiving calls each week, so our work is ongoing."" State and local agencies comment We also shared our transcript of the phone message with the Austin Police Department and the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, which has a consumer protection function. Lisa Cortinas of the APD emailed us a 2017 APD press release describing a scam in which callers purported to represent the IRS with the incoming phone number showing up as an APD number. ""These scammers are not legitimate,"" the release said. Kayleigh Lovvorn of the attorney general’s office told us by email: ""This is a very common ‘IRS scam’ that usually increases at tax time across the entire country."" Lovvorn pointed out a 2017 Paxton press release stating: ""Scam artists tell consumers that they owe back taxes and threaten to have them arrested if they don’t provide immediate payment."" Advice: Hang up The TIGTA inspector general said in the agency’s 2016 release: ""If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS or in a new twist, the Treasury Department, and uses the threat of legal action if you do not pay immediately, that is a sign that it is not the IRS calling, and your cue to hang up. ""Again,"" George said then, ""do not engage with these callers. If they call you, hang up the telephone."" The APD and Paxton releases each had the same advice. Our ruling An automated phone message fielded in Austin said that unless the recipient called back about ""your tax filings,"" you ""will be taken into custody by the local cops as there are more serious allegations pressed on your name.""

Scott Walker claim of Eric Holder making Supreme Court race 'highly partisan' ignores GOP role
","Is Barack Obama’s attorney general, a possible candidate for president, to blame for making a pivotal Wisconsin Supreme Court campaign ""highly partisan""? Republican Gov. Scott Walker raised the issue six days after Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet, who was backed by liberals, won election to the high court. Her win in the officially nonpartisan race raised hopes among Democrats of a ""blue wave"" of election victories, including denying Walker a third term in November 2018. Walker was interviewed April 9, 2018 by Jay Weber, a conservative talk show host on WISN-AM in Milwaukee. Referring to Dallet’s defeat of Michael Screnock, a Sauk County circuit judge backed by Walker and other conservatives, Walker said: Even Tuesday's election for the Supreme Court -- which, in the end, kind of boiled down to a ballot test between parties, even though it's supposedly nonpartisan, and that's really because Eric Holder and his group came in and made it highly partisan. Wisconsin Supreme Court races have seen partisan involvement in recent years, but the 2018 race set a new standard for partisanship. Let’s see if it was Holder -- the attorney general for most of Obama’s presidency, who is considering a run for president himself in 2020 -- who made the Supreme Court race ""highly partisan."" Holder’s involvement On March 15 and 16, 2018, Holder campaigned for Dallet in Milwaukee and Madison. At the time, he said the group he leads, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, was spending $140,000 on digital ads backing Dallet and that it might spend more. Later in the campaign, it was reported that Holder’s committee had spent a total of $165,000 to support Dallet. But on election night, the group said that it and its affiliates had ""invested more than $500,000"" to elect Dallet. (Note: In February 2018, Holder’s committee sued Walker over his refusal to call special elections to fill two open legislative seats. The suit successfully forced Walker to call the elections.) So, Holder himself and his group played a major role in backing Dallet. And it’s true that as national figures, Holder and his group added a national partisan dimension to the race. But the Wisconsin Republican Party played a major role in backing Screnock, starting before Holder did, and it doesn’t get much more partisan than a political party. First in -- the GOP Months before Holder’s involvement, Republican Party groups in Wisconsin started backing Screnock. For example, on Nov. 9, 2017, five months before election day, the Washington County Republican Party in suburban Milwaukee gave $500 to Screnock’s campaign. Later, other county parties, including those in Racine, Polk, Ozaukee, Sheboygan and Walworth counties, gave to Screnock’s campaign. On Feb. 8, 2018, the state GOP gave Screnock’s campaign a $31,152 in-kind donation. And five days later, Screnock’s campaign reported having received nearly $111,000 more from the GOP. On March 27, 2018, the state party announced a statewide radio, direct mail, digital, and billboard advertisement campaign attacking Dallet. In all, Screnock’s campaign received about $400,000 in help from the state and local Republican parties, the Associated Press reported. Our rating Walker says ""Holder and his group came in and made"" the Wisconsin Supreme Court race ""highly partisan."" Holder came to Wisconsin in March 2018, a few weeks before election day, to campaign for Dallet. And a group he leads said it and its affiliates spent more than $500,000 backing Dallet. That added a national partisan dimension to the campaign. But you can’t get any more partisan than a political party, and county Republican Party groups started backing Screnock months earlier, in November 2017. Ultimately, Republican Party groups, led by the state party, backed Screnock to the tune of some $400,000.

Another problem with the post: It said that Aldrin had said ""he was a spaceship on his way to the Moon,"" the post said, when he saw ""something out there that was close enough to be observed … sort of L-shaped."" According to the post, Aldrin passed a test akin to a lie detector, only ""more reliable."" That’s an incomplete and misleading snippet from a Reddit Ask Me Anything session he took part in three years ago. Here’s the full comment. ""On Apollo 11 (en) route to the Moon, I observed a light out the window that appeared to be moving alongside us. There were many explanations of what that could be, other than another spacecraft from another country or another world -- it was either the rocket we had separated from, or the 4 panels that moved away when we extracted the lander from the rocket and we were nose to nose with the two spacecraft. So in the close vicinity, moving away, were 4 panels. And i feel absolutely convinced that we were looking at the sun reflected off of one of these panels. Which one? I don't know. So technically, the definition could be ‘unidentified.’ ""We well understood exactly what that was. And when we returned, we debriefed and explained exactly what we had observed. And I felt that this had been distributed to the outside world, the outside audience, and apparently it wasn't, and so many years later, I had the time in an interview to disclose these observations, on another country's television network. And the UFO people in the United States were very very angry with me, that I had not given them the information. It was not an alien. Extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence. That's what Carl Sagan said. There may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies. The probability is almost CERTAIN that there is life somewhere in space. It was not that remarkable, that special, that unusual, that life here on earth evolved gradually, slowly, to where we are today. ""But the distances involved in where some evidence of life may be, they may be hundreds of light years away."" Bottom line: In the Reddit session, Aldrin clearly rejected any suggestion that the light he saw was some sort of of space alien. A representative for Aldrin told PolitiFact that the lie-detector angle is bogus as well. ""We don’t know where this new UFO story came from,"" said Christina Korp, vice president of marketing, media and business development for Aldrin. ""Buzz did not take a lie detector test. He has never said he saw a UFO."" Referring to the light he mentioned in the Reddit session, Korp said, ""Buzz has been very clear on this over the years and has never wavered in his description of it. He does not believe in UFOs. ... This is not the first time someone has tried to capitalize on using Buzz’s name to make headlines."" The Aldrin story appears to have originated with an April 8 ""exclusive"" article in the Daily Star, a site based in the United Kingdom. Various websites ran articles with headlines claiming that Buzz Aldrin passed a lie detector test claiming he ""encountered alien life.""   However, a spokeswoman for Aldrin said the retired astronaut never took any type of ""lie-detector"" test. Meanwhile, Aldrin was clear in the Reddit session three years ago that he felt an unusual  light he saw during space flight had prosaic origins and was not an alien.

Protesters for hire? Sacramento Sheriff provides no evidence for inflammatory claim
","Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones claimed ""paid protesters"" fueled the conflict with law enforcement after a recent vigil and demonstration for Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old shot and killed by police. Responding to a call of a man breaking car windows, Sacramento police fired 20 times at Clark, who they said was advancing toward them with a gun in his grandparents’ backyard on March 18, 2018. Later, it was revealed, he was carrying a cellphone. Ever since, demonstrators have filled Sacramento’s streets, as well as city council meetings, calling for police reform. Jones made his statement about paid protesters during a news conference in early April. The sheriff showed video from March 31, 2018 of a deputy’s SUV striking a demonstrator who walked in front of the vehicle. A crowd of marchers had blocked two sheriff’s SUVs after a vigil for Clark in south Sacramento. Deputies had asked the crowd to step away before the collision took place. Jones described some of the people in the streets as ""professional protesters and professional instigators."" ""We do know because of our intelligence, because of the same folks that we see at protests completely out of the area and because of our history with some of these folks that there are paid protesters,"" the sheriff added. ""And paid people to instigate just as there are paid folks to monitor protests and video camera for their own purposes."" When asked for evidence by a reporter at the conference, Jones said: ""We do have evidence of it and we've seen it previously,"" though he was not specific. For this fact-check, we decided to zero in on Jones’ claim that some ""paid protesters"" took part in the Stephon Clark demonstrations, either on the evening of the vigil or before. Protest organizers have described the sheriff’s statement as baseless and inflammatory, saying the demonstrators are volunteers and not for-hire protesters. Stephon Clark, 22, was shot and killed by Sacramento police on March 18, 2018. Courtesy photo Response from sheriff’s department In a phone interview, Sgt. Shaun Hampton, a spokesman for the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, declined to provide evidence supporting the sheriff’s statement. ""I don’t think we’re going to disclose that at this time,"" Hampton said, adding that he did not foresee the department disclosing evidence in the future. He also declined to say why Jones made the claim without providing any supporting material. ""It’s based on our information,"" he said. Jones appears to be the only top law enforcement official to make such a claim. A spokesman for the Sacramento Police Department told us he did ""not have any specific information"" about paid protesters. Asked about paid protesters on Capital Public Radio's Insight program, Sacramento Police Chief Daniel Hahn said he believes Jones was referring only to the March 31, 2018 demonstration outside city limits.  ""I don't know. We weren't there,"" Hahn said of any payments. A spokeswoman for the California Department of Highway Patrol, which has also provided law enforcement at the demonstrations, said in an email the ""CHP does not have evidence of paid protesters.""  Hundreds gather at the Sacramento District Attorney’s office on April 4, 2018 demanding justice for Stephon Clark. Vanessa S. Nelson / Capital Public Radio Response from protest organizers Most of the Sacramento demonstrations after Clark’s death have been well organized and peaceful. There have been isolated cases of vandalism, including breaking car windows, the disruption of a city council meeting, a brief closure of a freeway and the closure of a basketball arena. Jamier Sale is an organizer with the ANSWER Coalition’s Sacramento chapter. It helped lead the March 31, 2018 vigil and protest. ANSWER stands for Act Now to Stop War and End Racism. The national organization helped organize the U.S. antiwar movement opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq, according to its website. Sale challenged Jones to release evidence to support his claim. ""We’re an all volunteer-based organization and we’re run all from donations,"" Sale told PolitiFact California. ""And we print our signs and we put them on sticks with our own hands. Nobody pays us to do anything. We’re organized and we’re effective. And if we come off as professional, that’s because we take what we do very seriously."" Claire White is an attorney representing Wanda Cleveland, the woman struck by the deputy’s SUV. She is also vice president of the National Lawyers Guild Foundation, a volunteer organization which monitors police activity at protests, including at the recent Sacramento events. ""This allegation that these people are paid, or that they’re outside agitators, has no basis in reality,"" White told Capital Public Radio. ""The longer that Sheriff Scott Jones tries to sell that snake oil to the public, the more it’s going to tarnish his own credibility."" Tanya Faison is with the Sacramento chapter of Black Lives Matter, which has also organized recent protests. ""We are not paid,"" Faison said. ""We work for free. Some of us are mothers, students and interns. We do this on the side."" She said Jones’ comments are ""irresponsible"" and could give his supporters in the community ""permission to be more aggressive"" with protesters. David Meyer is a sociology and political science professor at UC Irvine who wrote the book The Politics of Protest: Social Movements in America. He said politicians frequently make claims about paid protesters, without evidence, to marginalize people who represent opposing points of view. He said Democrats made those allegations about Tea Party activists in 2009 and Republicans made them about liberal activists who packed congressional town hall meetings in 2017. Meyer said it’s not realistic to think groups paid for protesters in the Stephon Clark case. He added that the sheriff’s ""assertion without evidence is unconscionable."" Other claims without proof This isn’t the first time PolitiFact has examined a provocative claim from a politician who didn’t support it with evidence. President Trump has repeatedly stated there was ""serious voter fraud"" in California in the 2016 election — without providing any proof. PolitiFact California investigated that allegation and rated it Pants On Fire. In February 2017, PolitiFact National probed a claim by GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas that political activists were ""being paid"" to protest members of Congress. It concluded ""It’s possible some protesters somewhere may be paid, but there’s zero evidence of a wide-ranging conspiracy to bring in paid activists to disrupt meetings."" It rated that claim False. Our ruling  Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones claimed ""paid protesters"" inflamed recent demonstrations over the death of Stephon Clark. Protest organizers say Sacramento’s streets have been filled with volunteers, not for-hire demonstrators. They’ve called the sheriff’s claim baseless. Jones appears to be the only top law enforcement official to make this assertion and has said he has evidence to back it up. His spokesman, however, declined to provide any information to support it and said it’s unlikely they ever will.

Walmart targeted in online free coupon scam
","If you see an Internet offer from Walmart promising a $75 coupon, know that it’s a scam. A story circulating on Facebook appears to offer a discount in exchange for taking a three-question survey about Walmart. Why? Because, the story says, the mammoth retailer is celebrating its 125th anniversary. First of all, Walmart was founded in 1962. So it’s at least 55, not 125. More importantly for Walmart fans, the offer is not real. Walmart spokeswoman Tara Aston confirmed the scam. ""We care deeply about our customers and have procedures in place to help protect them from criminal behavior,"" she said. ""We frequently review our educational and prevention measures and when necessary, take additional steps to better inform our customers about the dangers of scams."" Walmart also clarifies on its website cases of fraud in which surveys are listed as potentially suspicious. A legitimate survey from Walmart is only taken on its official website. PolitiFact decided to test out the offer. When clicking on the survey link, we were notified that only 456 coupons remained. (That number didn’t change as we refreshed and revisited the page at different points.) The survey consists of three questions: Have you ever shopped at Walmart? You prefer Walmart because of? Are you satisfied by the services of Walmart? When we finished, we were asked to share the survey with our Facebook friends — the promised coupon never materialized. It wasn’t a bug. It’s just not real. Neither were free Delta and Southwest airline tickets. We rate this scam Pants on Fire. ",/factchecks/2018/apr/10/walmis2018-com/walmart-targeted-online-free-coupon-scam/

Was Scott Pruitt's apartment rental about market rate?
","When Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt was getting settled in Washington in 2017, he paid the wife of a gas and oil lobbyist $50 a night for her condominium on Capitol Hill. Pruitt used the space for about six months and only paid when he needed a room. The terms of the lease carried the whiff of a sweetheart deal with an industry that had dealings with the EPA. President Donald Trump on Twitter defended this and other controversial aspects of Pruitt’s decision-making in an April 7 tweet: ""While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA. Record clean Air & Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars. Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job!"" For this fact-check, we will examine whether the price tag for Pruitt’s short-term living arrangement was ""about market rate."" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump relied on an initial assessment from the EPA. ""He was referencing a report done by the EPA, which we are continuing to review,"" Sanders said April 9. ""But in that, it cites the apartment was at market value."" That EPA report came from the agency’s general counsel Kevin Minoli, written after media reports forced the issue into the open. ""Market value for rental apartments is commonly thought of in terms of rental cost per month,"" Minoli wrote March 31. ""Under the terms of the lease, if the space was utilized for one 30-day month, then the rental cost would be $1500, which is a reasonable market value."" Based on that and other details, Minoli said the lease was not a gift. Washington’s Capitol Hill neighborhood offers a wide range of apartment options. Browsing on the rental website Zillow, we found that some of them go for about $1,500 a month, or $50 a day for a 30-day month. But those have only one bedroom, and we know that the condominium Pruitt rented had two. His daughter used the other bedroom when she spent time in the city. Even for one-bedroom units, the prices can easily go well over $1,500. Rents of $1,800 to $2,000 are common. For two-bedroom units, we found one for $1,850, but after that, the prices went up to $2,200 and higher. Pruitt described his lease as similar to an Airbnb rental, where he only paid for a bedroom when he was in town. But unlike that sort of Airbnb arrangement, he had access to the other amenities in the apartment, extending to the second bedroom used by his daughter. Pruitt got an Airbnb deal without the typical Airbnb drawbacks.  Tim Burr with Yarmouth Management, a company that focuses on Capitol Hill rentals, said paying only when Pruitt needed the place made the terms notably convenient for Pruitt. ""With Airbnb, you’re not guaranteed it will be available when you want it,"" Burr said. ""That’s very unusual."" We looked at the current Airbnb rates. The lowest price we found for immediate use was $40 a night, however, that is not the norm. To be fair, we can’t see the rates Pruitt might have seen in the winter of 2017. (Changing the dates, we did find one shared space in a one-bedroom for $23, which seems an unlikely option for Pruitt. Comedian John Oliver also browsed Airbnb and suggested Pruitt could have done worse — crashing on a couch named Black Beauty.)  Pruitt said he might not always have free run of the apartment, but the use of the bedroom was not in question. It’s important to note that ultimately, he only paid about $1,000 a month for the place. As the press reported more details of Pruitt’s arrangement, the EPA’s Minoli followed up his first report with a statement handed to reporters. ""Some have raised questions whether the actual use of the space was consistent with the terms of the lease,"" Minoli said April 5.  ""Evaluating those questions would have required factual information that was not before us and the review does not address those questions."" So, two days before Trump’s tweet, the EPA had backtracked on at least part of its ethics review. One day before Trump’s tweet, the Office of Government Ethics, the watchdog body for the executive branch, raised doubts about Pruitt’s lease. In a letter to the EPA on April 6, the ethics office wrote ""additional information has now come to light that calls into question whether the earlier determination that the Administrator paid market value for the use he made of the apartment would still be valid."" Trump said that Pruitt paid approximately market rate for the living space he rented from the wife of an energy lobbyist. Trump based that on a review from the EPA, but the agency later said it lacked all the facts to fully assess the situation. A real estate professional familiar with rents in the neighborhood said the terms of the lease were unusually convenient for Pruitt. Our scan of current rents showed that the prices of two-bedroom apartments were higher than what he would have paid if he had stayed there every night for the entire six months. Pruitt was there only about two-thirds of the time, paying closer to $1,000 a month. No one-or-two-bedroom units were available under any terms for that price. The one caveat is we haven’t seen the exact terms of Pruitt’s lease or exactly how he and his family used the condominium. With that in mind, we rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/apr/10/donald-trump/did-epas-pruitt-pay-below-market-rent/

Do Oregon and the federal government have more than 1 million acres of burnt land with millions of rotting trees?
","The timber wars of the 1980s and the lawsuits they spawned brought logging on Oregon’s public lands almost to a halt. Even now, annual timber harvests are a fraction of what they were several decades ago. The issue of how much timber should be cut has flared up again as Congress wrestles with a plan, unveiled by U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., that could double harvests on more than 2 million acres of federal forests across western Oregon. The Claim Medford businessman Gordon Challstrom, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, wants harvest levels far higher than they are now. In a recent website statement, Challstrom wrote, ""Oregon and the federal government now have more than one million acres of burnt land and millions of trees being left to rot."" One million acres of burnt land? Millions of trees left to rot? We took a look. The Analysis We called Challstrom and asked how he arrived at his figures. He directed us to an online map managed by the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center that lets people click on areas that have burned in recent years. A box pops up displaying the name of the fire, when it started and how many acres it consumed. Although Challstrom’s claim included no time frame, he told us he arrived at his figure by adding acreage totals of fires larger than 10,000 acres. Going back as far as initial salvage efforts in the wake of the giant Southern Oregon Biscuit Fire in 2002, he came up with 2.7 million acres. Since 51 percent of Oregon’s land is owned by the federal government, he said, he applied that to the 2.7 million acre number and ended up with the 1.4 million acres he’s characterizing as ""burnt land."" (The Congressional Research Service puts federal ownership of lands in the state at 53 percent.) Here’s how Challstrom got to his final 1 million figure: ""I tried to be fair,"" he said. ""I gave them the benefit of the doubt that they’ve logged on 400,000 acres, but I really doubt it."" The assertion that ""millions of trees"" are being left to rot on that acreage, he added, ""only stands to reason."" We added up totals from the interactive map and arrived at about the same 2.7 million acre figure Challstrom did. But we had questions about the way he came up with his 1 million acre total for ""burnt land."" We called Isaiah Hirschfield, intelligence officer at the interagency coordination center, which tracks long-term fire information. He said Challstrom’s methodology assumed that fires would break out evenly across the state, thus allowing him to come up with his 1 million acre figure by dividing total lands burned by the acreage owned by the federal government. ""That’s not an effective way to come up with that calculation,"" he said. Even so, Hirschfield added, Challstrom’s figure turns out to be in the ballpark. Citing agency statistics, he said an average of 250,000 acres have burned each year going back a decade. ""Cumulatively,"" he said, ""that’s 2.5 million acres, so he’s still pretty close."" Hirschfield pointed out an important caveat -- a portion of those burns, including a couple very big ones, were on both publicly and privately owned rangeland east of the Cascades. So while those blazes charred a lot of grass, they didn’t touch many trees. Challstrom’s claim did say ""more than"" one million acres. And while areas that burned a decade ago are more than likely covered with new vegetation by now, according to experts we talked to, it’s still true that more than one million acres of land burned in Oregon during the combined 2012 and 2013 fire seasons, according to U.S. Forest Service statistics. Verifying the second part of the claim -- the ""millions of trees left to rot"" -- is more difficult. For additional perspective, we called Paul Barnum, executive director of the Oregon Forest Resources Institute, an agency established by the Oregon Legislature in 1991 to gather and provide information about forest management. Forests west of the Cascades average 200 to 400 trees per acre, he said, while their eastside counterparts have sometimes ended up crammed with as many as 4,000. That occurred, he said, because of historic fire-suppression efforts. Some forests are so overgrown that a spark can result in a catastrophic wildlife. ""What’s true is that there never should have been that much biomass per acre in eastern Oregon,"" Barnum said. ""With that noted, it could very well be true that there are millions of trees left in those areas. But without walking every acre, there is really no way of verifying that."" John Bailey, silviculture and fire professor in Oregon State University’s College of Forestry, agreed. ""This would be nearly impossible to check,"" he wrote in an email. ""This analysis has been done for a few individual fires such as the much studied 2002 Biscuit Fire in southwest Oregon, but I don’t know anyone who has consolidated this data for all fires in the past decade."" To arrive at a reasonable estimate, you would need to know not only the number of acres burned in each fire, but also how many trees per acre there were, what percent were killed in the fire and how much salvage logging was done, according to Bailey. The Ruling Challstrom, as part of his 2014 gubernatorial campaign, said Oregon, as a result of forest fires, has ""more than one million acres of burnt land and millions of trees left to rot."" The first part of the claim is easily verified by simply adding up total acres burned in forest fires over the past decade or so. The second part, according to two forestry experts, is impossible to pin down. As for Challstrom’s claim, part of it is accurate, even if he used some faulty analysis to arrive at it. The second part is nearly impossible to verify but, according to one expert ""could very well be true."" We rate Challstrom’s claim Half True.

Dan Branch worked for a pro-Reagan Texas committee, though he wasn't a Reagan aide
","Texas attorney general candidate Dan Branch surely isn’t unique in touting a connection to Ronald Reagan, who ranked among the most popular recent presidents upon leaving office. But we grew curious about Branch’s closeness after spotting a video ad for Branch, a Republican state representative from Dallas. ""Dan Branch worked with Ronald Reagan and helped re-elect him,"" the narrator said in the ad posted online Feb. 4, 2014. A Branch radio ad, posted Jan. 29, similarly said that Branch ""worked with Ronald Reagan and helped re-elect him."" Texas warhorses of the Reagan era -- George Strake, who then chaired the Republican Party of Texas; Ernest Angelo of Midland, a leading Reagan supporter; and Tom Pauken, then in the Reagan administration -- each told us by telephone that he didn’t recall Branch working with Reagan. Pauken, saying Branch had long been more closely associated with the Bush wing of the party, called Branch’s statement ""misleading."" We asked Branch’s campaign manager, Enrique Marquez, for the basis of the ad claim. He said by email that Branch was hired in 1984 to ""administer the Victory Fund of the Reagan/Bush '84 re-election effort in Texas, reporting directly to Reagan/Bush Texas co-chairs, U.S. Sen. John Tower and Martha Weisend,"" who are both no longer living. ""The Victory Fund,"" Marquez said, ""was a joint effort of the Reagan/Bush '84 campaign in Texas and the state Republican party."" Marquez added that in his role, Branch met Reagan at Texas campaign stops. Asked for more detail, Marquez emailed that Branch succeeded Bob Estrada as the fund’s administrator. Estrada, a Dallas lawyer and investment banker, told us by phone that Branch was already the deputy administrator when he was promoted to take Estrada’s place as the committee’s administrator in May or June of 1984 after Estrada agreed to work for the Reagan-Bush campaign in Washington, D.C. Estrada said the purpose of the Victory Fund was to register and turn out voters for the president and other Republicans, including Phil Gramm, the party’s nominee for the Senate seat being given up by Tower. Estrada had no objection to Branch saying he ""worked with"" Reagan. ""Millions of people worked with Reagan. Do you have to be a Cabinet member to say you were directly involved?"" Estrada said. ""People who stood in the mall and handed out brochures worked with"" Reagan. We also reached Karl Rove, the long-time adviser to George W. Bush, who said by phone that he remembered Branch as the de facto chief operating officer of the Victory Fund, which Rove described as a volunteer-intensive effort to lift Reagan-Bush and others. At the time, Rove said, he handled some direct-mail work for the committee and also offered advice. Rove said Branch, who was 26 at the time of Reagan’s re-election, ""had a significant role for someone his age."" Our ruling Branch said he ""worked with Ronald Reagan and helped re-elect him."" This partly holds up in that Branch was an underling for a Texas committee devoted to helping Reagan win re-election and to electing other Republicans. Then again, his claim leaves the impression that Branch was right alongside Reagan, perhaps as a White House aide or joining in the president's day-to-day travels. Not so.

Begich supports 97 percent of Obama's economic policy, GOP challenger says
","U.S. Sen. Mark Begich, a Democrat, brands himself as being ""as independent as Alaska."" Unsurprisingly, Republicans in the primary field for the 2014 midterm election versus Begich beg to differ. One such candidate, former state Attorney General Dan Sullivan, argued in a campaign email that Begich’s votes are in line with President Barack Obama’s positions on economic issues. ""Instead of standing up to President Obama’s reckless economic policies, Mark Begich has supported them 97 percent of the time,"" the email read. ""By rubber-stamping overspending and over-regulation, Begich and Obama are stifling our nation’s economic growth and standing in the way of job creation."" Begich, Alaska’s junior senator, faces re-election for the first time in November. The leading Republican challengers are Sullivan and Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell. Sullivan briefly served as attorney general. Since November 2010, he’s been commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. This is his first run for public office. PolitiFact wanted to know if Begich and Obama really agree on economic issues 97 percent of the time. Let’s crunch some numbers Sullivan’s campaign office pointed us toward CQ Weekly’s presidential position votes report. That’s from Congressional Quarterly, a nonpartisan outlet for congressional news and legislative tracking. That analysis shows that, out of the pool of votes where Obama ""took a clear position,"" Begich’s vote matched the president’s stance 97 percent of the time.   In 2013, the Senate took 291 roll call votes. CQ registers Obama as having taken a clear stance on 108 of those votes, or about 37 percent. We found the same trends across CQ reports since Begich took office in 2009. CQ put him voting with Obama over 90 percent of the time for each year served. This data looked at all votes, not just votes on economic policy. Also, all Democrats received 90 percent and higher ratings in the 2014 report. That shows that, in general, Democratic senators tend to vote with their president. CQ’s Roll Call, on the other hand, offered a different picture of Begich’s reputation in a profile of the race: ""Since entering the Senate, Begich, a former Anchorage mayor, has struck an independent pitch and continues to highlight his focus on Alaska issues, even when they swim upstream from the administration’s priorities."" That independence was reflected in a different congressional rating we looked at from OpenCongress, a nonpartisan legislative tracking service that tracks how often each senator votes with the majority of his or her caucus. OpenCongress then ranks the results within each party, giving a more detailed take on where individual senators fall on an ideological spectrum. In 2013, for example, OpenCongress said Begich voted with the majority of Democrats 87.1 percent of the time. That’s based on all 291 Senate votes. OpenCongress ranked Begich at 45th for 2013 when it comes to voting with his party. That shows that Begich is among the most independent senators currently serving. Both the CQ and OpenCongress data focus on senators’ overall voting record, not specifically on economic policy, as Sullivan’s claim said. On economic policy, Begich voted against the March 2013 Senate budget proposal passed by nearly every other Democrat. Begich has also opposed Democratic measures in favor of free trade agreements with Colombia and Panama, and legislation that would put more taxes on the oil and gas industry. ""National Democrats often try to pay for something with oil and gas taxes,"" Begich told Politico in January. ""And I have to explain that ain’t happening: That ain’t happening over my dead body."" Our ruling Sullivan’s campaign email claimed Begich supports Obama’s economic policies 97 percent of the time. The statistic the campaign offered looked at all Senate legislation, not just economic policy. Most Democrats scored 90 percent or higher. In another vote analysis that ranked Democrats according to party loyalty, Begich ranked only 45th. Notably, he’s crossed his party on economic issues like yearly budgeting and oil taxes. Sullivan’s claim hinges on one statistic in a way that doesn’t accurately reflect Begich’s voting record on economic policy.

Medical marijuana ballot initiative requires doctors' input but not a prescription for 'debilitating' conditions
","As medical marijuana heads to the ballot in Florida in November, opponents like Senate President Don Gaetz have argued that it will be too easy for people who want to smoke pot recreationally to get their hands on it. ""The ballot initiative is the legalization of marijuana,"" said Gaetz in an interview on Florida Face to Face on Feb. 13, 2014. ""It doesn’t require a physician writing a prescription and it can be for purposes as specious as having a back that needs to be scratched. That’s the legalization of marijuana that I oppose and will vote against in November."" We’ve already fact-checked claims about the initiative, and there’s some merit to the argument that people will be able to get medical marijuana for a wide variety of conditions. But Gaetz’s claim about physicians struck us as suspicious, so we decided to check it out.   Would patients need a prescription? In a 4-3 ruling in late January, the Florida Supreme Court paved the way for the amendment about medical marijuana to appear on the November ballot. The ballot summary mentions doctors right off the bat: ""Allows the medical use of marijuana for individuals with debilitating diseases as determined by a licensed Florida physician. Allows caregivers to assist patients’ medical use of marijuana. The Department of Health shall register and regulate centers that produce and distribute marijuana for medical purposes and shall issue identification cards to patients and caregivers. Applies only to Florida law. Does not authorize violations of federal law or any non-medical use, possession or production of marijuana."" But if you read further into the amendment text, you’ll see that technically patients wouldn’t get a ""prescription."" Instead, patients will need a ""physician certification,"" which the amendment text states means ""a written document signed by a physician, stating that in the physician‘s professional opinion, the patient suffers from a debilitating medical condition, that the potential benefits of the medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the health risks for the patient, and for how long the physician recommends the medical use of marijuana for the patient. A physician certification may only be provided after the physician has conducted a physical examination of the patient and a full assessment of the patient‘s medical history."" Robert Mikos, a Vanderbilt law school professor who specializes in drug policy, told PolitiFact Florida that there is a fine distinction between a certification (or a recommendation, as it’s commonly called in other medical marijuana states) and a prescription. Doctors generally don’t ""prescribe"" marijuana, because in order for a physician to be allowed to prescribe narcotics, the doctor must register with the Drug Enforcement Agency. If the practitioner were to prescribe a Schedule I drug like marijuana -- which means under federal guidelines it is a dangerous narcotic, with no approved medical uses -- they would lose their registration, and would legally no longer be allowed to prescribe drugs. On the other hand, a 2002 federal court decision did find that a doctor could simply recommend the drug, protecting the discussion with their patient under First Amendment protections of freedom of speech. ""In the legally relevant sense, it’s no different than a doctor recommending jogging every day,"" Mikos said. The certification in practice would largely be a piece of paper documenting the discussion, and would create a paper trail similar to a prescription, in order to track who is getting the drug and why. Once a patient gets that certification, the Department of Health will issue the patient an identification card, according to the ballot language. Under the Florida law, patients would not be able to grow their own plants. Approved patients could purchase marijuana from registered, state-regulated centers. If the amendment passes, the Department of Health will set rules for how centers will operate. What sort of conditions would be covered? The amendment text lists a number of qualifying conditions for medical marijuana, including cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDs, Hepatitis C, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. But as Gaetz’s spokeswoman Katie Betta noted, it also includes this language: ""or other conditions for which a physician believes that the medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient."" The Supreme Court, in allowing the amendment to go forward, noted that conditions that qualified would be those that ""cause impaired strength, weakness or enfeeblement."" We’ve previously noted that the ballot language suggests marijuana could be recommended for conditions like muscle spasms, neck pain, back pain and menstrual cramps, because all those conditions could be described as ""debilitating."" This means anyone who has a condition that weakens or enfeebles them could qualify to use marijuana if their physician indicated that their use of marijuana outweighed the potential health risks. That would include a wide range of ailments, and Gaetz’s spokesperson defended his choice of words on those grounds. ""The president is making the point that the amendment is open-ended because it states that a physician can issue a certification allowing for the use of medical marijuana for any condition where the benefit could outweigh the risks. ..."" Betta told PolitiFact in an email. ""The Supreme Court’s ruling did not interpret the amendment for application and will not be bound by any interpretation that was advanced related to the ballot summary challenge."" Still, Gaetz seems to be going too far using an example of ""a back that needs to be scratched."" Certainly, chronic itching can be a serious condition, but Gaetz's implication is that a condition with a simple remedy could be used to qualify for marijuana. The ballot language sets a higher bar than that, noting that the condition must be ""debilitating."" Our ruling Gaetz said the medical marijuana ballot initiative ""doesn’t require a physician writing a prescription, and it can be for purposes as specious as a back that needs to be scratched."" Because of federal law, doctors won’t be writing prescriptions. Instead they will write a certification after examining the patient, determining the patient would benefit from marijuana and how long the patient should use it. Gaetz’s statement suggests Floridians could get marijuana without a doctor being involved, but that’s not the case. Gaetz’s claim that someone can get marijuana for having a back in need of scratching is also misleading. The ballot language says that a condition must be debilitating, which means it weakens the person. While many different types of conditions could qualify under this definition, a back that simply needed scratching wouldn't qualify.

David Alameel airs outdated count of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and incomplete information on possible reductions
","Calling for an end to the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, Democratic U.S. Senate aspirant David Alameel cited troop counts that made us wonder. Alameel, a Dallas investor and Army veteran, said in a Feb. 7, 2014, email blast: ""It’s long past time to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home. It has been more than 12 years and more than 40,000 troops are still stationed in Afghanistan with no clear objective."" ""Even in the best case,"" his email also said, ""by the end of the year at least 10,000 American soldiers will still be on the ground."" We can’t judge any ""clear objective,"" but current and expected U.S. troop counts are checkable. And to our inquiry, a Pentagon spokeswoman, Elissa Smith, shortly sent a chart by email showing U.S. troop levels in that country from November 2001, after 9/11, to February 2014, when there were 34,000 American troops there, down from 46,000 at the start of December 2013. According to the government, more than 2,100 U.S. troops have died in the conflict. A January 2014 report by the authoritative Congressional Research Service summarized the build-up of American troops in Afghanistan and the build-down. ""The number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, which peaked at about 100,000 in June 2011, was reduced to a ‘pre-surge’ level of about 66,000 by September 2012, and is expected to fall to 34,000 in February 2014,"" the report said. ""The ‘residual force’ that will likely remain in Afghanistan after 2014 is expected to consist of about 6,000-10,000 U.S. trainers and counterterrorism forces, assisted by about 5,000 partner forces performing similar missions."" The report continued: ""The U.S. troops that remain after 2014 would do so under a U.S.-Afghanistan security agreement that has been negotiated but which President Hamid Karzai, despite significant Afghan public and elite backing for the agreement, refuses to sign until additional conditions he has set down are met."" More up-to-date information was available when Alameel spoke. By email, Alameel campaign spokeswoman Suzie Dundas pointed out two news reports on troop levels by CBS News, which attributed figures to the U.S. military. A Jan. 9, 2014, CBS News news story said that roughly 38,000 ""American service members remain in Afghanistan."" We spotted one higher U.S. troop count, which Dundas ultimately said was the basis of Alameel’s statement. As of the end of 2013, according to a Jan. 10, 2014, report on Afghanistan by the Brookings Institution, roughly 43,000 U.S. troops were in Afghanistan. In contrast, the Pentagon’s chart indicates 38,500 U.S. troops were there at the start of January and about 34,000 U.S. troops there just before Alameel spoke. And what about troops expected to be there at the end of 2014? According to a Jan. 22, 2014, CBS News report noted by Dundas, the Pentagon had just proposed leaving 10,000 troops in Afghanistan after 2014 and drawing down the number of troops to zero by the end of 2016. But other news stories published at the same time said President Barack Obama had been presented with a recommendation including the possibility of having no troops in Afghanistan by year’s end. A Jan. 22, 2014, New York Times news article specified that the Pentagon had proposed that 10,000 troops remain in Afghanistan when the international combat mission ends there later in 2014--or no troops at all. The Times story also said 10,000 troops are ""around the minimum number officials say is required to protect the remaining diplomatic, military and intelligence personnel and installations in the country,"" Caitlin M. Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, was quoted as saying that Obama ""has not yet made decisions about final troop numbers,"" which Smith, the Pentagon spokeswoman, reaffirmed to us. Similarly, other news articles--like the Times, quoting unidentified officials--said the recommendation to Obama was to reduce troop levels to 10,000 or to go to zero. Stars and Stripes, a newspaper serving members of the military based in the Department of Defense but operating independently from it, quoted officials as saying the recommendation came from Gen. Joseph Dunford, the top U.S. and NATO coalition commander in Afghanistan, who discussed it during a meeting of the White House National Security Council. The Wall Street Journal said in its story: ""Military leaders told Mr. Obama that if he rejects the 10,000-troop option, then it would be best to withdraw nearly all military personnel at the end of this year because a smaller troop presence wouldn't offer adequate protection to U.S. personnel, said officials involved in the discussions."" Our ruling Alameel, who advocates ending the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, said more than 40,000 U.S. troops remain there now and under his ""best-case"" scenario, at least 10,000 will remain at the end of 2014. This claim may have been close in spirit, but it aired outdated information. There were about 34,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan just before Alameel piped up though there had been more than 40,000 troops there as of December 2013. Also by the time the candidate spoke, a general had reportedly recommended reducing U.S. troop levels to 10,000--or zero--by the end of this year, though no decision had been announced. We rate this claim, which overstates both the troops there now and the possible number of troops by year’s end, as Half True.

Florida GOP says Alex Sink 'supported higher sales taxes'
","U.S. House candidate David Jolly is largely refraining from direct attacks against Alex Sink’s background as a banker, state chief financial officer and gubernatorial candidate. His supporters from the Republican Party of Florida, however, have had no such qualms. In a slew of campaign fliers and TV commercials, the GOP have hammered at the former CFO’s record, particularly on taxes. In a mailer that showed up in Pinellas County mailboxes around Feb. 17, 2014, the party said Sink ""supported higher sales taxes, property taxes, water taxes and taxes on cable TV."" We’ve already covered the claim about water and cable taxes, finding it Mostly True. But what about sales taxes? Give us a minute, and we’ll ring that one up, too. A taxing claim Republicans turned to Sink’s one term as Florida’s CFO, from 2007 to 2010, to find the basis for this attack. The mailer cites a Dec. 16, 2008, story from the Palm Beach Post about state lawmakers calling a special session to deal with an expected $2.3 billion budget shortfall as the Great Recession took hold of the state. The story said, ""Democrats including Sink have asked GOP leaders to consider raising taxes, consider repealing sales tax exemptions and reinstitute the intangibles tax."" The Republican-led Legislature announced the two-week January session to deal with precipitously declining state revenues, which had already led to $7.4 billion in budget cuts from 2006. Even plugging the $2.3 billion hole during the special session would have left the state more than $5 billion in the hole the following year. When announcing the session, GOP lawmakers refused to address the deficit with tax or fee increases or the ratification of the gambling compact with the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and wanted to deal with the problem by cutting state services and transferring trust fund dollars. Sink, the state’s CFO, said the state’s tax system should be overhauled when legislators convened. ""Every sales tax exemption ought to be back on the table, ought to have to see the light of day,"" Sink said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. ""Somebody ought to stand up and defend why an exemption is fair and legitimate or it's not."" Among the items that enjoyed sales tax exemptions at the time: fitness club memberships for hospitals, bottled water, magazines and newspapers ordered through the mail, charter boat fishing, high school and college sports team skyboxes, valet parking, photo finishing, pet grooming, lawn & landscaping services, racing dogs, Super Bowl tickets and ostrich feed. Ending exemptions on catalog and Internet orders were also part of the discussion. Sink had suggested ending some exemptions since at least 2007, but we didn’t find any particular item she singled out. Instead, Sink simply wanted legislators to consider the potential revenue streams that ending exemptions could bring. One bipartisan poll showed the state could have raised some $560 million in new revenues by closing exemptions. Legislators eschewed examining the tax system, opting instead to appropriate $700 million from a tobacco settlement endowment fund that paid for health care programs for children and the elderly. They also postponed $300 million in bonds for the Florida Forever land purchase program and cut about $600 million from public education and health care, among other actions, before the regular session dealt with an even larger deficit in March. We should note that closing tax loopholes is not only a Democratic idea in Florida. Republican Gov. Rick Scott, the head of the Republican Party in Florida, has said he is willing to support a move to start collecting sales tax on online purchases, so long as it is accompanied by equal tax cuts. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida accused Sink of having ""supported higher sales taxes."" They pointed specifically to her stance on discussing the repeal of some sales tax exemptions in the wake of falling tax revenues in 2008. The way the GOP words it, however, makes it seem as if Sink were seeking to make a broad-based tax hike. Actually, Sink was supporting a review of sales tax exemptions. While that is not exactly raising the sales tax, it does have the same repercussions as a higher tax on those groups and industries. Overall, though, Sink was asking the Legislature to consider ending sales tax exemptions for a host of interest groups, not supporting raising sales taxes for everyone. Without that context, the claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/feb/21/republican-party-florida/florida-gop-says-alex-sink-supported-higher-sales-/
"['Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Income', 'Jobs', 'Labor', 'David Cicilline']","
U.S. Rep David Cicilline says minimum wage is worth $2 less than it was 45 years ago
","Debate over raising the minimum wage is heating up. President Obama is advocating for it, Democrats in Congress are promoting it and their Republican counterparts are warning that it would have a negative impact on the U.S. economy. Adding fuel to that fire was Tuesday's Congressional Budget Office report, which predicted that increasing the minimum wage would lift 900,000 people out of poverty but cost 500,000 jobs. U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, D-RI, went on the floor of the House on Feb. 11 to argue that inflation has eroded the value of the minimum wage, now $7.25 per hour, over time. ""It's been five years since those working for the minimum wage have seen an increase in the minimum wage, and according to one study, the minimum wage today is worth $2 less than in 1968. This is shameful, and we have the responsibility to address growing income inequality by increasing the minimum wage immediately,"" he said. In other words, a worker in 2014 would need to earn $9.25 an hour to have the same buying power a minimum-wage worker had in 1968. We wondered whether that was true. Cicilline's office wouldn't say what study the congressman was referring to. When we asked Cicilline about it during a Feb. 18 news conference, he said couldn't recall. Instead, his chief of staff said a Google search had just uncovered a June 2013 Huffington Post article headlined, ""The Minimum Wage Is Worth $2 Less Today Than It Was In 1968: Study."" The Huffington Post article cites a study from the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal Washington, D.C. think tank funded by organized labor, that quotes the $2 figure but doesn't analyze the minimum wage directly. Instead, it quotes another EPI study that did, looking at the minimum wage value from 1968 through 2012. It reports that the 1968 minimum wage of $1.60 per hour was essentially worth $9.25 in 2012 dollars, precisely two dollars less than $7.25. But what was the difference when Cicilline gave his speech this month?  The latest EPI study, issued Dec. 19 by David Cooper, puts that difference at $2.15. When we tried to confirm that calculation by going to the online inflation calculator from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we came up with an amount that was even higher: It said that today's $7.25 minimum wage is worth $3.46 less than in 1968, a much bigger difference than what Cicilline cited. Why the difference? The online calculator, Cooper said, uses the conventional Consumer Price Index, known as CPI-U. He and other researchers use a variant of that, called the CPI-U-RS, which tries to take the modifications that have been made to the CPI-U over the years and apply them to previous years. Although the government doesn't claim one index is better than another, he said the CPI-U-RS is designed to do a better job of accurately capturing the changing value of the minimum wage. If you adjust an old minimum wage for inflation using the traditional CPI, its value appears much higher today. In summary, Cicilline says he was quoting a report, but we're not sure what report that was. There is a report that supports his claim, as his staff noted, but it's out of date. He said the buying power of the minimum wage in 1968 was, in effect, $2 higher than its value today. The difference in 2013 dollars, by one measure, is actually $2.15. That's pretty close. By another measure, it's even more: $3.46. His underlying point -- that the minimum wage has significantly less buying power than it had 45 years ago -- is correct, and the erosion in the minimum wage is even more dramatic if you use the conventional cost of living index. We rate his statement Mostly True.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Jason Carter']","
Carter scores well with claim about teacher cuts
","On Tuesday, Jason Carter, a Democratic state senator from Atlanta and an announced candidate for governor, called for Georgia to do more to support its teacher workforce, including: restoring its commitment to a 10 percent bonus for National Board-certified teachers; bringing  back incentives for highly qualified and experienced pre-k teachers; and resuming HOPE scholarship programs designed to train and recruit teachers. Carter said there’s ample evidence that Georgia’s public schools -- and thus teachers -- have been dealt some tough blows. ""Since 2009, Georgia's public schools have lost nearly 9,000 classroom teachers while the number of students has gone up,"" he said in a statement. Carter, a grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, is expected to hammer hard in the governor’s race against the policies of the GOP majority and years of state budget cuts to education. Those cuts, combined with falling local property tax collections, have forced school districts to reduce staff, increase class sizes, furlough employees and shorten their school years. Chances ramped up for education to be a hot topic in the Republican primary as well, with State School Superintendent John Barge in the mix of announced GOP challengers to incumbent Gov. Nathan Deal. We started our truth test of Carter’s statement by asking for the source of his information. A spokeswoman referred us to a November report published by the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute. The report was based on an online survey taken over the summer. Of the state’s 180 school districts, 140 -- representing 92.8 percent of all public schools -- participated, according to the GBPI. Among the findings: The surveyed districts now have 8,982 fewer teachers in their classrooms than they did in 2009. We checked in with the state’s two major teacher groups -- the Professional Association of Georgia Educators and the Georgia Association of Educators. The data developed by the GBPI and cited by Carter seems ""credible to me,"" PAGE spokesman Tim Callahan said. Added GAE President Calvine Rollins: ""What we do know is that class sizes have increased tremendously."" We compared the GBPI information against data that districts are required to submit annually to the state.The results were very similar. In fiscal 2009, which covers the 2008-2009 school year, Georgia had 120,660 teachers in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade -- 115,277 full-time and 5,383 part-time -- according to the annual state report card on education. That compares with 111,401 public school teachers -- 107,729 full-time and 3,672 part-time -- working in fiscal 2013, or the 2012-2013 school year. And the difference is 9,259 fewer teachers statewide. As to the claim by Carter, that school enrollment rose in this period, state data show he’s correct. Student enrollment wasn’t growing rapidly but it did increase. There were 1,615,066 students in Georgia public schools in fiscal 2009 and 1,657,506 in attendance in fiscal 2013, according to state data. On Oct. 1, the 180 districts collectively counted and reported to the state Department of Education that they had 1,723,439 students on their rolls. Carter’s statement was based on solid  numbers. Georgia has lost about 7.6 percent of its teachers since 2009. Enrollment wasn’t booming, but it did grow by about 2.6 percent. We rate his statement as True.

"['Environment', 'Oil Spill', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Charlie Crist mostly opposed oil drilling except in 2008 he called for a study of it
","In April 2010, Deepwater Horizon exploded, resulting in a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The spill raised questions about policy positions on oil drilling for several politicians, including then Gov. Charlie Crist. At the time of the spill, Crist was struggling in a Republican U.S. Senate primary against soon-to-be Sen. Marco Rubio; he ended up switching to ""no party affiliation."" In 2013, Crist announced that he was running for governor again -- this time as a Democrat. We decided to look back at Crist’s statements on oil drilling through his tenure and place them on our Flip-O-Meter, which evaluates whether a politician actually changed position. We leave it to voters to decide the significance of our findings.   1998-2008 Overall, Crist expressed opposition to drilling throughout much of his career, from state senator to education commissioner to U.S. Senate candidate to attorney general. A sampling: June 20, 1998, in a Florida Times-Union interview during his first U.S. Senate campaign against Bob Graham: ""Having grown up here, it's hard not to feel strongly about the beauty that is Florida. I would and already have fought offshore drilling in Florida, and would continue that fight in Florida."" An Oct. 10, 2006, interview with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board: ""Offshore oil drilling, I'm adamantly opposed to it. I think a lot of that has to do with growing up here. I'm a Gulf Coast guy. ... I remember when I was in elementary school, we had an oil spill in Tampa Bay. You may recall that. I literally remember cleaning birds off when that happened."" Oct. 20, 2006, at a press conference, on the qualities Floridians want in a president: ""Making sure that we don’t drill for oil off our beautiful shore, and, of course, the other traditional things that go along with it."" In his inaugural address as governor in January 2007, Crist called for ""clean rivers, beautiful beaches and coastlines free of oil drilling. This is a vision we can make a reality."" Crist as vice presidential contender in 2008 In 2008, with gasoline prices hovering near $4 a gallon and Crist being mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate (on a ticket that would popularize the phrase ""drill, baby, drill!""), Crist backed off his previous unflinching opposition. After Republican presidential contender John McCain gave a June 17 speech in Houston calling for opening up more waters to drilling, Crist said: ""We have to be sympathetic to the pocketbooks of Floridians and what they're paying at the pump for gas and balance that with any way that our state might be able to contribute in terms of resources to have a greater supply and therefore lower prices,"" Crist said. ""I think an open-minded person understands that we ought to at least study (offshore drilling)."" Crist offered some caveats at the time: ""It would all depend on the parameters,"" he said. ""How far off the coast, how safe it would be, how much it would protect our beaches."" To environmentalists and Democratic leaders, Crist’s statement was a major reversal. ""It seemed that he would be the last person to change course on this,"" said Eric Draper, policy director for Audubon of Florida, at the time. U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston, called Crist's position ""a 180-degree flip-flop."" ""I don’t understand Gov. Crist’s Flip-Flop on this,"" she said. ""The risk to our environment and to our economy -- I mean the governor, of all people, should know better."" The next week Crist delivered a speech at a global climate change summit in Miami. ""We must have an open discussion – without compromising Florida’s sensitive ecosystems and natural beauty,"" Crist said of offshore drilling. ""As I stated last week, only when we are able to do so far enough from Florida’s coast, safe enough for our people and clean enough for our beaches, should we consider increasing our oil supply by drilling off Florida’s shores. Let me repeat that – far enough, safe enough and clean enough."" Crist witnesses 2010 spill But in 2010, after flying over the gulf and seeing the Deepwater Horizon spill firsthand, Crist withdrew his support for any form of drilling off Florida's coasts. ""It could be devastating to Florida if something like that were to occur,"" Crist said. ""It's the last thing in the world I would want to see happen in our beautiful state."" Crist also repeated the criteria laid out in his 2008 climate change address, saying the gulf spill proved drilling isn't yet far enough away, clean enough, or safe enough. ""Clearly that one isn't far enough, and that's about 50 to 60 miles out, it's clearly not clean enough after we saw what we saw today - that's horrific - and it certainly isn't safe enough. It's the opposite of safe,"" Crist said. Crist summoned legislators to a special session in July with hopes that they would put an oil drilling ban on the November 2010 ballot. But the Republican-dominated Legislature delivered him a defeat within hours of convening. Post 2010 Crist lost his U.S. Senate race in 2010 and Republican Rick Scott became the governor. In February 2011, Crist returned to Tallahassee to stand with Democrat Alex Sink and environmentalists to announce his support for a state constitutional amendment to ban oil drilling. ""This puts it in the hands of the people and that’s exactly where it should be,"" Crist said. At an October 2012 gathering with several former governors, Crist said Florida shouldn’t consider oil drilling. He declared the BP oil spill to be ""the greatest wake-up call of all time."" ""There are just too many other ways to produce energy — solar, wind, things that the Sunshine State of all places should be leading in,"" he said, according to the Gainesville Sun. Crist announced in November 2013 that he would run for governor again. In an interview with Watermark, a central Florida publication that covers the gay community, a reporter asked Crist if elected if he would continue to support the ban on offshore drilling. ""Yes,"" Crist replied in the interview published in December. ""How could you be governor during the BP oil spill and not get that right. That was a wake-up call."" We sent a summary of our findings to Crist’s campaign and received a response from former sen. Steve Geller, a Democrat advising Crist. Geller said the BP oil spill convinced Crist that nothing near Florida would be ""safe enough, far enough, and clean enough."" Did Crist flip? For most of his career Crist has opposed offshore oil drilling in Florida. He spoke against drilling repeatedly between 1998 and 2006. But in 2008, he was a potential Republican vice presidential contender amid high gas prices. At that time, Crist said Florida should study drilling and have an ""open discussion"" about it -- though in a speech he offered caveats that it would have to be ""far enough, safe enough and clean enough."" Even that suggestion was enough to anger environmentalists, but in the end that’s all it amounted to -- a suggestion to study it.   The 2010 explosion put the lid on that discussion for Crist, and he again returned to his adamant stance against drilling -- a position he has reiterated as recently as late 2013.

After he left the GOP, Charlie Crist said he no longer supported Florida's gay adoption ban
","PolitiFact Florida has explored former Gov. Charlie Crist’s change of positions on a number of issues, including gay rights. Here, we wanted to look at his record on gay adoption. At one time, Florida gained national attention as a state that banned gay adoption. PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter doesn’t pass judgment on someone’s stance change -- we simply measure if the person did indeed ""flip"" and to what extent. Many politicians of both major parties have ""flipped"" -- or gay rights supporters might say ""evolved"" -- in their stances on gay rights; we leave it up to readers to decide how they feel about those flips. 2006-08 In 2006, Crist was Florida’s Republican attorney general running for governor. At the time, Florida banned gay couples from adopting but allowed them to serve as foster parents. During the race, Crist often said he was against such adoptions. ""I think we need to encourage the traditional family for adoption and that's what I support,"" Crist told reporters in February 2006. In an MSNBC debate Oct. 30, the moderator asked Crist his opinion on gay adoption. ""I am opposed to it. I think that we have in our state some rules that permit adoptions within our system, but I don’t think gay adoption is appropriate,"" said Crist, who would go on to win the race. ""I believe that the traditional family is the best means by which to raise children."" Some state lawmakers pushed to drop the ban in 2007 but Crist continued to express support for it. In 2008, foster parent Frank Martin Gill of North Miami, filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the ban. When asked about the ban, Crist reiterated his support for it. ""No second thoughts,"" he said, in an October 2008 Miami Herald article. In November 2008, a Miami-Dade judge struck down the ban and declared it unconstitutional. The state continued to fight for the ban in court, and Crist reiterated his stance to the Palm Beach Post editorial board in February 2010. ""My belief is the best way to raise a family is in the traditional family,"" Crist said. ""That’s how I feel. That’s what the current law is in Florida. I respect the law."" But within months, his stance would change. 2010 Senate race As Crist was lagging behind in the Republican Senate primary against Marco Rubio, he left the GOP to run as an independent in April 2010. Crist needed independent and liberal voters to stand a chance. Crist told Time magazine in June 2010 that he would be open to changing Florida's law to allow a judge to determine what's best for the child. ""That might be a way to go, and it's certainly something we ought to look at,"" he said. ""A better way and approach would be to let judges make that decision on a case-by-case basis,"" he told the Florida press association in June 2010. On Sept. 12, 2010, Crist released a position paper on gay rights including adoption: ""We need to take politics out of adoption decisions. That is why I oppose Florida's current law that requires Family Law judges to ignore what is right for a child in order to adhere to what Florida law blindly demands. There is only one question that matters: What is in the best interest of that child?"" On Sept. 22, an appeals court struck down the ban, and Crist announced that Florida would no longer enforce the policy that had been in place since 1977. He called the ruling ""a very good day for Florida"" and ""a great day for children."" (That ruling is still in effect today.) ""Children deserve a loving home to be in, and the opportunity for judges to make this call on a case-by-case basis for every adoption,"" Crist said. In a Senate debate in October, Crist was asked to explain his reversal on gay adoption. ""As we get older, I call it the convergence of life experience and wisdom. When you learn through the time of life more tolerance and become less judgmental, I think that's a good place to be,"" Crist said. We sent a summary of our finding to Crist and former Sen. Steve Geller, a Broward Democrat who is informally advising Crist. Geller noted that ""many people’s views on issues involving gays were evolving during this time. President Obama, Bill Clinton, most voters, and others evolved. Those who did so earlier versus those who have stayed opposed need some credit."" Our ruling During his 2006 Republican race for governor, Crist repeatedly supported the state’s ban on gay parents adopting and argued in favor of the ""traditional family"" adopting. By June 2010, Crist had ditched the GOP and was running as an independent -- and made statements in support of Floridians adopting. He became vocal about his support in September in a position paper on gay rights.

'Marketplace' host Kai Ryssdal talks CBO report on minimum wage and lost jobs
","The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office re-entered the spotlight this week with a report that offered a little something for everyone on the effects of raising the federal minimum wage for workers. For those pushing for a $10.10 an hour wage, the CBO concluded 16.5 million low-wage earners would make more money a week under the proposal. For people opposing the increased federal wage, the report found that raising it to $10.10 an hour would cost the country 500,000 jobs. On American Public Media's Marketplace, host Kai Ryssdal tried to explain the developments to listeners. Marketplace is a business and economic affairs program that airs on NPR stations in many U.S. markets. ""From the Congressional Budget Office today, this little tidbit: You remember President Obama's plan to raise the minimum wage for new federal contract workers to $10.10 an hour? He signed the executive order just the other day, right? Well, the CBO said today that will cost the economy 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016. Me? I figure the partisan bickering over that starts right about ... now."" A PunditFact reader flagged Ryssdal's comments and asked us if they were accurate. (You can hear them about 5 minutes into this podcast.) In this case, Ryssdal wrongly linked President Barack Obama's executive order for federal contract workers to what the CBO studied, which was the proposal to raise the minimum wage for workers nationwide. The CBO concluded if the federal government gradually increased the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for all workers, and tied future increases to inflation, the economy would shed 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016 (all things constant under current law). That’s about 0.3 percent of the workforce. For the record, CBO analysts also said the number of lost jobs could vary depending on a number of factors. Overall, the effect could be anywhere from a ""very slight"" decrease in employment to a reduction of 1 million workers, CBO found. The White House objected to CBO's findings, with economic adviser Jason Furman telling reporters the report ""goes outside of the consensus view"" of economists who study the effect of higher minimum wages on employment. The CBO analysis did contain good news for the White House, however. It concluded an additional 900,000 families would be pulled out of poverty and 16.5 million workers would get a raise if the minimum wage is increased to $10.10 an hour. Marketplace senior producer Sitara Nieves acknowledged the mistake in an email to PunditFact and said it would be corrected on air. Our ruling Ryssdal said a Congressional Budget Office report found that an executive order raising the minimum wage for new federal contract workers ""will cost the economy 500,000 jobs."" A CBO analysis did conclude that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour could cost the country 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016.

MSNBC's Maddow: Earthquakes led a Texas airport to close fracking-related well
","If couples in Central Oklahoma felt the earth move on Valentine’s Day, it might not have been passion. Five earthquakes hit the area last Friday, followed by a sixth the next day. The quakes weren’t big. The strongest measured 3.5 on the Richter scale, but all of them were over the threshold to get residents’ attention. Rachel Maddow noticed as well. The MSNBC host linked the flurry of seismic activity to the region’s sizeable number of wells used to dispose of waste from oil and gas hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Oklahoma has about 6,000. There are many clustered in the county where the quakes took place. Maddow suggested that Central Oklahoma take a tip from Texas. ""When the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport needed to stop its earthquake spike a few years ago,"" Maddow said, ""they temporarily shut down the wells that were injecting fracking fluid into the ground at high pressure on the airport property, and lo and behold, those earthquakes stopped."" A reader asked us to see if that is true. We can report that it is. ""It’s an accurate assessment,"" said Dave Magana, the senior manager for public affairs at the airport. In fracking, operators pump water and chemicals into the ground to release oil and natural gas. When those fluids come back to the surface, the wastewater is moved to a disposal well where it is pumped back deep into the Earth. In 2008, the airport had leases with the Chesapeake Energy company for two such wells. One of them was near an old inactive fault line. The wells became active in September 2008 and the first earthquake came in October of that year. Brian Stump, a seismologist at Southern Methodist University, was part of a team that studied what was going on. ""Based on the timing and the location of the earthquakes, there was a plausible linkage,"" said Stump. Dallas-Fort Worth managers took Stump’s report to heart. ""The airport asked Chesapeake to close the well, and they did,"" Mangana said. The earthquakes stopped. The well in question has remained inactive, although a second well on airport land continues to operate. Fracking and its environmental impacts are a contentious issue. A study from the National Academy of Sciences did not find that getting natural gas this way led to ""induced seismic activity."" However, it did conclude that disposal of wastewater ""does pose some risks."" Our ruling Maddow said, ""When the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport needed to stop its earthquake spike a few years ago, they temporarily shut down the wells that were injecting fracking fluid into the ground ... (and) those earthquakes stopped."" An airport official confirms Maddow's story, aside from the fact that it was one well. Officials at the airport asked that a well be shut down, and after it was, the earthquakes eventually stopped. Seismologists linked the well to the earthquakes. We rate the claim True. Update: This item was updated on Feb. 24, 2014, to make clear that airport officials asked Chesapeake Energy to shut down the well.",/factchecks/2014/feb/19/rachel-maddow/msnbcs-maddow-earthquakes-led-texas-airport-close-/

Lawrence O'Donnell says Chris Christie steered $6 million in Sandy funds to New Jersey area that had 'no damage' from storm
","MSNBC anchors continued their exhaustive coverage of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s no-good 2014 recently with a look at how he went to bat for new senior housing in a small town. What’s so bad about that? O'Donnell suggested that Christie wasted Superstorm Standy relief money to help fund the project. On his Feb. 11 show, O’Donnell opened with clips of Christie speaking to the Economic Club of Chicago, where Christie said he fought for Superstorm Sandy relief money ""because every dollar that we’ve been shorted will have an impact on the lives of the people of my state. And as governor, your job is to fight for those people as hard as you can."" That’s when O’Donnell chimed in: ""Now, of course, Christie knows that he’s talking to an audience that knows nothing about what he’s talking about. That is his specialty as a public speaker. ... He was talking to an audience that did not know that he helped funnel $6 million in federal Hurricane Sandy money to a senior center in Belleville, N.J., a place that suffered no damage."" PunditFact wanted to dig deeper into O’Donnell’s assertion. Where did O’Donnell come up with that?  The claim is grounded, for the most part, in a Jan. 28 investigation by The Star-Ledger newspaper of Newark, N.J. The crux of the report: Christie personally pushed for hurricane relief money to build a senior housing project that had been in the works long before Superstorm Sandy in Belleville, a town in Essex County. Belleville was ""not particularly hard hit,"" the newspaper reported, with some flooding, downed trees and some week-long power outages. But Essex County was one of nine counties deemed most impacted by the storm by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. As part of $1.8 billion in various federal disaster relief grants, Christie directed $6 million to the senior housing project. Christie played a prominent role during a May 2013 groundbreaking ceremony for the new housing complex, which will cost $18 million overall (the day after he famously traversed the Jersey Shore with President Barack Obama). Town mayor Raymond Kimble praised Christie for committing to the facility’s construction, saying it will help seniors stay in their hometown instead of spending their final years somewhere new. (Here’s a video.) Christie echoed those remarks as he described how he kept in constant contact with various state and local officials about the project (video): ""This project was so worthy, and to be honest, so overdue that I felt like there was no time to wait. We needed to do this and do it quickly,"" Christie said. Two weeks later, Kimble, a Democrat, endorsed Christie as the governor faced re-election. The coverage from that day, and the speeches, included little mention of a connection to Superstorm Sandy, or that the housing was needed as part of the storm response. What was the damage? It’s too far to say Belleville suffered ""no damage."" Most if not all of New Jersey felt something, even if it wasn’t as severely pummeled as the Jersey Shore. All 21 counties were declared major disaster areas. A Rutgers University study found that Belleville ranked 255th out of 553 municipalities in what researchers called the Sandy Community Hardship Index. The index measures the residential, commercial and municipal damage to each New Jersey town -- with No. 1 being the hardest hit. Kimble, Belleville’s mayor, told the Star-Ledger he did not know of any residents who were displaced by the storm, and experts told us there are no good numbers for displaced residents for the state overall. About 3 percent of Belleville’s households, or 43, had major or severe damage from the storm, whereas anywhere from 10 to 113 percent of households in various parts of Toms River, N.J., suffered major or severe damage, according to New Jersey’s action plan for a Community Development Block Grant for disaster relief. The Star-Ledger more recently published another investigation into Sandy spending, this time finding nearly one-third of the $160 million pot designated for new affordable housing projects after the storm went to Essex and Middlesex counties, which were not as affected as coastal communities. There’s more to the story, says Team Christie Let’s review the facts that aren’t up for disagreement: The senior facility is slated for $6 million in Sandy relief funds, and Christie made sure the senior center got the money. There is also little debate that Belleview did not suffer the brunt of the storm, though describing it as ""no damage"" as O’Donnell did is an overstatement. What Christie’s team disputes is the suggestion that the Belleview senior housing project is not connected to Superstorm Sandy. Christie’s press office, both in the Star-Ledger story and in an email to PunditFact, said the 137-unit housing project served a need for affordable rental housing for people displaced by the storm. A group of about 35 housing projects approved for disaster grant funding, including the Belleville facility, ""were awarded objectively and helped expand affordable housing in Sandy-affected counties to give impacted renters permanent housing options as close to their homes as possible,"" said spokesman Colin Reed. Put more simply, Reed said the project will serve a need of people in Essex County and elsewhere who were affected by the storm. An executive at the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency has told reporters the goal was to choose ""shovel-ready projects."" But neither Christie nor other local officeholders at the groundbreaking mentioned that purpose (though a county press release did include a passing mention about housing essentially being available to Sandy survivors). Instead, the officials talked about how the project will allow Belleville seniors to stay in Belleville. ""Seniors shouldn’t have to leave the place where they raised their family to find affordable housing,"" Christie said. Adam Gordon, a staff attorney for the New Jersey-based Fair Share Housing Center, said the idea that residents from harder-hit areas would uproot their lives and move into a Belleville senior housing complex about an hour away from coastal communities is not really credible. ""You shouldn’t be able to use ‘shovel ready’ as an excuse for things that are not located in, or really near, the areas that are hit the hardest,"" Goodman said, ""or places that are basically saying ‘we’re marketing this to seniors in our town.’ "" We could not reach a spokesman for O’Donnell’s show. Our ruling O’Donnell said Chris Christie ""helped funnel $6 million in federal Hurricane Sandy money to a senior center in Belleville, N.J., a place that suffered no damage."" O’Donnell is right that Christie helped steer $6 million in Sandy money to a senior center. And he’s right that Belleville fared much better than other places in New Jersey, though to say ""no damage"" is an exaggeration. Because of that caveat, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/feb/19/lawrence-odonnell/lawrence-odonnell-says-chris-christie-steered-6-mi/

Do Oregon women earn 79 cents for every dollar men earn for doing the same job?
","Income inequality has emerged as a significant issue heading into the 2014 campaign season. One hot-button piece of that debate focuses on what some politicians, researchers and economists call the gender pay gap. In his recent State of the Union address, President Barack Obama mentioned the gap when he said that, nationally, women earn an average of 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. In Oregon, Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian posted an ""issue statement"" on his campaign website on Jan. 31, 2014, that customizes the issue for the Beaver state. ""In Oregon,"" according to the post, ""women earn an average of 79 cents for every dollar that men earn for doing the same job. That’s just wrong."" We agree, that would be quite the disparity. But is it accurate? We checked. We called Avakian’s office and spoke with Charlie Burr, communications director for the state Bureau of Labor and Industries, which Avakian oversees. Burr said the claim is based on statistics included in the fall 2013 edition of ""The Simple Truth about the Gender Pay Gap"" issued by the American Association of University Women. A table in the report lists, by gender and state, median annual earnings and earnings ratios of men to women for full-time, year-round workers ages 16 and older. The information, drawn from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, showed that men in Oregon earned $47,402 in 2012, compared with $37,381 for women. We checked the Census information ourselves and found the information was accurate. That put the income earned by women at 79 percent of their male counterparts. The table showed that, nationally, the figure is 77 percent. PolitiFact National has already looked into this issue, so we checked the most recent offering, which, in analyzing Obama's State of the Union address, called the president’s 77-cent ratio  ""a credible figure from a credible agency."" The wording of Obama’s and Avakian’s claims, however, is problematic, PolitiFact National has found. That work determined that adding the words for the same work or in the same job slightly weakened the claims’ accuracy. One reason is that federal agencies aren’t entirely in agreement when it comes to tracking such statistics. The Census Bureau, for instance, tracks annual wages. That information yields the 77-cent figure. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, meanwhile, tracks weekly wages. Broken down that way, women earn 82 cents for every dollar men make. What’s the difference? The weekly analysis does not account for people who are self-employed, PolitiFact found, but does include some left out of the annual measure, such as some teachers, construction workers and seasonal workers. The gap narrows more -- to 86 cents -- if hourly rates are used, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data because those account for part-time workers, who include a larger percentage of women than men. We called Ariane Hegewisch, study director at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based nonpartisan think tank. ""The hourly figures still show there is a wage gap,"" she said, ""but they still don’t suggest that the 77-cent figure or Oregon’s 79-cent figure are wrong. They are just looking at different measures."" Nothing has shown that any gap is solely because of workplace discrimination, Hegewisch said. But studies controlling for factors such as level of education, hours worked and sector of work still leave 25 to 40 percent of the gap explainable only by discrimination, Hegewisch said. ""There are shades and important nuances here,"" she said. ""It’s not based on taking two people literally in the same firm and saying, ‘Are you being paid more or not?’ It’s also who gets hired at all. It’s still the case that the highest-paying firms tend to hire more young white guys than young anybody else."" Different pay for different work also plays a part, Hegewisch said. Laborers, who tend to be men, usually make more than, say, nursing aides, who tend to be women, she said. ""It comes down to more of a social issue of how we judge the value of different occupations."" Avakian, citing Census data and echoing claims by Obama and others, said women in Oregon ""earn an average of 79 cents for every dollar that men earn for doing the same job."" The report he relied on noted that the 79-cent figure applies to full-time, year-round work, although Avakian didn’t include those stipulations. For starters, the commissioner loses points for cherry-picking the 79-cent figure. Other means of measuring pay gaps between men and women put it considerably less. The same can be said of the ""for doing the same job"" piece. As PolitiFact has found previously, the existence of a pay gap doesn’t necessarily mean that all of the gap is caused by individual employer-level discrimination, as Avakian’s claim implies. Some of the gap is at least partially explained by the predominance of women in lower-paying fields, rather than women necessarily being paid less for the same job than men are. Finally, Avakian used the term ""average"" when the report he relied on said ""median."" He could have avoided that by simply saying women ""make 79 cents for every dollar a man earns,"" but since the information he cited contains only median incomes, we find the difference to be inconsequential. Those caveats aside, he still is well inside the ballpark and the ratio he cited is a credible figure from a credible agency. We rate the claim Mostly True.

State GOP says Burke drafted and promoted state budgets that were fiscally irresponsible
","Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke’s attack on Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s tax-relief plan drew a strong response from the state Republican Party. ""While Millionaire Mary Burke has called Walker’s tax relief plan ‘irresponsible,’ the reality is she helped construct some of the most irresponsible budgets and policies in our state’s history,"" said Joe Fadness, executive director of the state party, in a Feb. 10, 2014 news release. ""Burke promoted budgets that raised taxes by billions, created high structural deficits and raided funds to finance huge spending hikes."" Fadness accused Burke, who was state Commerce secretary from 2005 to 2007, of ""ignoring her record of drafting and sponsoring budgets that set Wisconsin on a downward spiral"" under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. In the election, prepare to hear a lot from Walker and his allies about Burke’s ties to Doyle. In this item, we’ll examine whether Burke helped ""draft"" ""sponsor"" and ""promote"" budgets that ""raised taxes by billions, created high structural deficits and raided funds."" Burke’s role in budgets During Burke’s tenure as commerce secretary, Doyle signed a pair of two-year state budgets into law. The first budget was introduced Feb. 8, 2005. Burke began her job just one day earlier as Doyle’s pick to run the state’s primary economic development agency. Department budget submissions were due in fall of 2004 and were months in the making, so Burke would have had effectively no chance to affect the Commerce budget, much less Doyle’s entire blueprint. Jesse Dougherty, spokesman for the state GOP, said that cabinet secretaries should be held accountable for what the Administration puts forth. As evidence that Burke ""promoted"" Doyle’s 2005-07 budget, Dougherty pointed to an April 2005 Wisconsin State Journal interview in which Burke said that while politically independent, ""I support Gov. Doyle's positions entirely."" Burke’s role in the second budget in question (2007-09) is somewhat clearer. She was responsible for and submitted the Commerce budget, but also spoke out enthusiastically in favor of a variety of initiatives in Doyle’s overall state budget, on taxes, education, worker training, health care and others. ""Gov. Jim Doyle's 2007-09 budget is a smart, responsible budget for Wisconsin businesses. It is fiscally responsible, identifies our priorities for success, and invests in those priorities,"" Burke wrote in a 2007 Commerce newsletter. So while Burke’s department is not involved in drafting the overall state budget, the GOP says her actions as a team player give her a degree of responsibility over the overall final product. We agree that Burke ""promoted"" the two budgets, but ""drafting"" goes too far. Fiscal impact of those budgets Let’s look at the three GOP statements about the Doyle budgets that coincided with Burke’s tenure. ""Raised taxes by billions"": The budgets Doyle submitted included tax-policy changes that raised net taxes, cumulatively, by $1.35 billion (down $12.68 million in the first budget, then up $1.371 billion in the second). Examples of changes included increases in cigarette taxes, a new tax on oil-company earnings, and a new revenues tax on hospitals. The budgets Doyle signed, after legislators changed them, raised net taxes by $351 million, according to reports by the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Big money, but not ""billions"" in either scenario. ""Created high structural deficits"": In criticizing Walker’s plan to return half of an expected surplus to taxpayers, Burke noted reports saying his plan would boost by about $100 million a potential $700 million shortfall -- or ""structural deficit"" -- heading into the 2015-17 budget. By contrast, the two Doyle budgets in question left much higher structural deficits -- $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion each -- than either of Walker’s two budgets. And, notably, Walker’s first budget actually created a small structural surplus for the following budget. ""Raided funds to finance huge spending hikes"": It’s been well-documented that Doyle and lawmakers repeatedly tapped segregated funds for roads, compensation in malpractice cases and other purposes in order to balance the state budget. Significant withdrawals occurred in the two budgets that overlapped with Burke’s time. Our rating State Republicans said that as state Commerce secretary, Burke drafted, sponsored and promoted ""budgets that raised taxes by billions, created high structural deficits and raided funds to finance huge spending hikes."" There are accurate elements here but some critical facts are ignored or misstated. Burke had a hand in budgeting, as any cabinet member would, and lauded two Doyle budgets, which did indeed leave high structural deficits and bust into segregated funds. But it’s a big overstatement to say she ""drafted"" two overall state budgets, especially given that the 2005-07 version came out just one day after she joined Doyle’s administration. In any event, those two budget proposals from Doyle raised taxes by $1.35 billion, not ""billions"" as claimed.

Verdict out on Balfour case costs
","What price justice? December’s trial of state Sen. Don Balfour, R-Snellville, cost taxpayers either a pittance or a pile, depending on whom you ask. Balfour, once chairman of the powerful Senate Rules Committee, stood trial in December on allegations he swindled taxpayers by submitting false state expense reports. He was acquitted after an 18-month investigation and a three-day trial. On the day that the jury verdict came down, Lauren Kane, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Sam Olens, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the Attorney General’s Office, as a ballpark figure, spent ""less than $100"" on the case, not including the salaries of prosecutors. Two readers asked: Is that plausible? We ourselves wondered. At trial, attorney William B. Hill Jr., a member of the Balfour defense team and a former deputy state attorney general, estimated the cost of prosecuting his client at $1.2 million to $1.5 million. We began our research by circling back to Kane with a request for records of all case expenses. Kane said a couple of more bills had come in, pushing the office’s costs for the case to $303.95. But what about staff time? What was the rationale for not counting that? Kane said the office didn’t count the salaries of the four prosecutors who worked on the case because they are ""fixed costs"" and those employees would have been paid, regardless. We checked in with two former prosecutors, a former investigator and a sitting Superior Court judge to see what they thought. They all said it is fair to consider staff salaries as part of the costs. To say otherwise is ""wrong,"" former DeKalb County District Attorney J. Tom Morgan said. ""They are lawyers, and the fact that they are working on the public dole does not mean their time is not worth anything,"" Morgan said. ""They are public servants who would be serving the public somewhere else if not for that trial."" The legal minds we consulted also pointed out that the AG’s Office has spent millions of dollars in recent years hiring outside attorneys because of shortages of staff and expertise in some areas of the law. More than one raised the question: If those staffers had been free to work on other cases, instead of Balfour’s, couldn’t the AG’s Office have been able to cut some of its outside legal costs? Kane said no. None of the work that is farmed out involves criminal cases, she said. The AG’s Office had four prosecutors working on the case against Balfour. Collectively, the four logged 570 hours. The highest-paid of them put in 160 hours, the equivalent of four 40-hour weeks, according to information provided by the AG’s Office. We put the calculator to work. We looked at the annual salaries of the four employees — $106,924, $99,846, $95,000 and $63,936 — and the hours each worked on the case. We put the cost for the staff time they said was dedicated to Balfour’s case at $22,667, or about 10 times the amount the defense said the senator was accused of wrongly pocketing over five years. We decided also to look at the time invested by the GBI, which launched a criminal investigation at the request of the AG and after Balfour admitted to the Senate Ethics Committee that he’d submitted some erroneous expense reports and agreed to pay a $5,000 fine. In response to an open records request, the GBI told us that the special agent in charge of the investigation worked 371 hours on the case and a forensic auditor logged 620 hours. The time investment of the two added up to $19,203, based on salary information provided. That put salary costs associated with the investigation and prosecution at more than $40,000. We went back to Hill to ask about his estimates. He said he based them on cases he’d seen come through in his decade-plus in the AG’s Office, including six years as deputy attorney general. He said he believes his estimate would be in the ballpark, if all costs were calculated, including the time of the judge, court personnel, jurors and the many people interviewed by state investigators and prosecutors. Balfour has said he spent $156,787 defending himself against 18 felony charges. He has asked to get that money back from the state, and that’s an issue still to be settled. After the trial, Olens issued a statement saying Balfour’s expense requests ""were too numerous and systematic to be simply isolated mistakes."" ""If those requests had been submitted by an unelected state employee, they would have been prosecuted,"" he said, ""and a state senator should not be held to a lower standard."" The jury foreman said she wasn’t sure how the reports became the subject of a criminal trial. ""Personally, when you started looking at the dollar amounts of the charges, it became ‘Are we really here to talk about this?’ "" she said in December. So where does that leave us? In an email to an AJC reporter on Dec. 19, Kane said the AG’s Office spent ""less than $100"" on the case. She said that did not include attorneys’ fees. She later amended the costs to $303.95 to include some subsequent bills. That fits with the original request for ""ballpark"" estimates of the office’s costs. The numbers provided were on target. But some critical information was excluded. Under our rating system, the statement merits a Half Truth.",/factchecks/2014/feb/19/lauren-kane/cost-prosecuting-balfour-put-test/
