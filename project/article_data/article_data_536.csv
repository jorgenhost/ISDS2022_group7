Sanders said Obama's SCOTUS nominees 'required' 60 votes, but it's more complicated
","Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said President Donald Trump’s nominees to the Supreme Court should follow the same confirmation process as the nominees of former President Barack Obama. In a Feb. 5 interview on CNN’s State of the Union, CNN host Jake Tapper asked if he would join an effort to filibuster Gorsuch’s nomination. ""Look, Obama’s nominations required 60 votes,"" Sanders said. He continued, ""Obama had to get 60 votes, that’s the rules of the United States. And if 60 people vote to confirm Judge Gorsuch, he will become the next nominee. That is the process, those are the rules that we operate under."" We decided to fact-check Sanders’ claim that Obama’s Supreme Court nominees ""had to get 60 votes."" Sanders has a point, but he is somewhat overplaying what happened. Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor received more than 60 Senate votes, but Senate rules only require a simple majority to confirm a Supreme Court nominee. Sanders’ comment echoes similar claims from other high-ranking Democrats after Senate Republicans blocked Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, to fill the vacancy created by Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. Here’s how the confirmation process will work for Gorsuch: He will testify in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. If the committee refers his nomination to the full Senate (a likely outcome due to the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee), a vote by the full Senate needs to be taken. The Senate majority leader moves to take the Senate into an executive session, the setting in which nominees are confirmed, according to Worth Hester, the assistant director of the Georgetown Government Affairs Institute. Then, the Senate majority leader needs to bring a nominee to a vote by the full Senate. In Gorsuch’s case, barring any outstanding circumstances, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will either get unanimous consent, a process by which every senator agrees to schedule a vote on a nominee. However, if unanimous consent cannot be reached, Sen. McConnell would need to invoke cloture. A ""cloture vote,"" agrees to place a time limit on the consideration of a nominee. A successful cloture requires 60 votes, the threshold Sanders has referenced. (His office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) After the cloture vote, Senate rules allow for 30 additional hours of debate, and then a final confirmation vote occurs, according to Sarah Binder, political scientist at George Washington University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Obama’s nominees cleared the procedural hurdles and won 60 votes and then some. The Senate confirmed Kagan by a roll call vote of 63-37 in 2010, and Sotomayor was confirmed in 2009 by a vote of 68-31. The last Supreme Court nominee to face a cloture vote to ensure confirmation was President George W. Bush’s nominee Samuel A. Alito Jr. in 2006. After the cloture vote, Alito was confirmed 58-42. That means at least two senators decided to allow the vote to go forward without actually voting for Alito themselves. (In Alito’s case, it was more than two, as 72 senators voted for cloture.) The accuracy of Sanders’ statement hinges on which vote we are talking about. If the Senate doesn’t unanimously consent to voting on the nominee, then 60 votes are required to end debate and hold a confirmation vote. But the confirmation itself, strictly speaking, requires only a simple majority. Our ruling Sanders said Obama’s Supreme Court nominations ""required 60 votes."" Going into the nomination fight, Obama had to prepare for the possibility that his nominees would need 60 votes to support cloture, as Alito required during the Bush administration. But once the unanimous consent agreement or cloture was reached, all the nominees needed was a simple majority.

Florida House speaker says funding Visit Florida doesn't impact tourism
","Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran is throwing sand on the state’s primary tourism agency, one of Gov. Rick Scott’s most prized possessions. Year after year, Scott has called on the Legislature to boost Visit Florida’s budget to bring in more tourists, and this year was no different. Scott asked for $76 million in 2017-18 fiscal year. Corcoran is driving legislation to kill both Visit Florida and Enterprise Florida, which oversees state business incentive programs. Corcoran says the state's investment is a waste of money. ""Spending more taxpayer money on VISIT FL (or less) has not demonstrated a direct impact on tourism,"" Corcoran tweeted Feb. 6. As we've said, spending more taxpayer money on VISIT FL (or less) has not demonstrated a direct impact on tourism pic.twitter.com/c2ecmdWxxa His tweet was accompanied by an infographic comparing the number of Florida visitors with the amount of funding given to Visit Florida. The various stats relay one message: More money to Visit Florida doesn’t equal more visitors.  On the surface, Corcoran’s numbers seem to support the crux of his claim. But tourism experts cautioned they don’t tell the whole story. They said the amount of money that tourists spend, and how long they choose to stay, is more important than the sheer number of visitors. Not all tourists are created equal. Measuring the success of marketing tourism is complicated Corcoran’s push to eliminate Visit Florida comes after a fair share of negative publicity the past year. In December 2016, Visit Florida CEO Will Seccombe resigned amid political backlash after the agency paid Miami rapper Pitbull $1 million to promote Florida, which included a video promo dubbed ""Sexy Beaches."" This secret terms of the deal led Scott to ask the agency to create new policies that increase transparency. To prove his point that tourism dollars don't have a direct effect on more tourists, Corcoran’s team sent data that included three measurements from 2000 to 2015: the annual number of Florida visitors, the amount of funding to Visit Florida, and the amount of money spent by Visit Florida per visitor. (The infographic only highlighted the first two measurements.) Based on Corcoran's numbers, between 2011 to 2015, Visit Florida funding increased from $34 million to $74 million, or a roughly 112 percent change increase. In that same time, the number of visitors only showed a approximately 22 percent change increase. Corcoran’s numbers seem to support his argument that increased spending historically didn't always lead to a tourist bump. But experts said annual counts aren't the only metric used to determine the success of a marketing investment. They also look at how much money tourists invest themselves. ""A primary marketing strategy is to get tourists to stay longer in a destination thereby spending more money,"" said Kathleen Andereck, a professor at the College of Public Service and Community Solutions at Arizona State University. David Preece, the academic director for the Center for Hospitality & Tourism at Brigham Young University-Hawaii, said the better way to see a return on investment in marketing tourism is to look at how much visitors spend and the resulting tax revenues, rather than the number of visitors. ""After all, you can’t deposit visitors in the bank, but you sure can deposit the money they leave behind,"" Preece said. Preece pointed to Visit Florida’s strategic plan to generate $100 billion in annual visitor spending by 2020. That number was $71.8 in 2012-13, $76.1 billion in 2013-14,  $82 billion in 2014-15, and $89.1 billion in 2015-16. That plan shows a trend of roughly an additional 7.5 percent spending per year which, if held, would reach $100 billion in the next couple of years, he said. Other factors can affect annual tourism arrivals and spending, too, making it further difficult to draw broad conclusions about tourism spending alone. Experts said these include hurricanes and other natural disasters, terrorism and crime, the political environment, gas prices, and the cost of flights. International visitors pack bigger wallets  Youcheng Wang, an associate dean at the Rosen College of Hospitality Management at University of Central Florida, knows firsthand why boosting Florida’s image can be so important, especially in international markets. Wang once attended an annual tourism meeting with China and the United States in Orlando. Wang said that before the marketing and tourism delegation from China arrived, they received a brochure highlighting popular tourist destinations. ""When I looked at the brochure my jaw nearly dropped,"" Wang said. ""In that brochure Orlando was described as small fishing village with 20,000 people."" Wang tells that anecdote as just one of the many reasons marketing tourism is important, especially in the lucrative international scene, where Visit Florida has made investments. The agency spent $1.2 million to advertise with the Fulham Football Club, a British soccer team (that isn't in England's famous Premier League). Part of the deal includes placing Visit Florida logos on the team’s jerseys and on the stadium’s roof, which is near London Heathrow Airport, one of the busiest in the world. Seccombe argued before leaving Visit Florida that targeting visitors from the United Kingdom was worth the effort. ""So everybody that flies into one of the busiest airports in the world sees 'Visit Florida' outside the window along with Buckingham Palace and Big Ben,"" Seccombe told the Tampa Bay Times. In 2015, the number of United Kingdom tourists that visited Florida reached 1.7 million. On top of that, British tourists outspent visitors from every other country except Canada by spending around $1.5 billion on their visits. They also stay in the state 13.3 days on average compared with 4.9 of a U.S. traveler.  Our ruling Corcoran said spending money on Visit Florida doesn’t have a direct impact on the tourism. He has an historical point that spending increases don't always bring more visitors, but that neglects a primary objective of marketing tourism — getting people to spend more money when they’re here. The amount of money visitors spend in Florida has increased steadily over the years. The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

Donald Trump did not make English the official language of the United States
","A headline on an article posted on several websites falsely declares that President Donald Trump has made English the language of the land. ""Breaking! President Trump makes English the official language of the United States!"" the headline reads. It’s obvious in the story that follows, which discusses changes on the White House website, that something was lost in translation. We first saw the headline on DonaldTrumpPOTUS45.com on Jan. 26, 2017, but it has appeared on other sites in subsequent days. Facebook flagged the story as part of its efforts to combat fake news in user feeds. First off, English may be the de facto language of the United States, but the country has no designated official language. A majority of states do have laws making English their official language, albeit to varying degrees. Trump also did not elevate English in any official capacity, although he has certainly made it clear he would prefer citizens (including fluent Spanish speaker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush) speak it. ""Well, I think that when you get right down to it, we're a nation that speaks English,"" Trump said at a 2015 news conference. ""I think that, while we're in this nation, we should be speaking English."" This is a prime example of a certain type of fake news story that spins news of a real event, then slaps a provocative and largely unrelated headline on it in an attempt to draw eyeballs. In this case, the body of the story clearly advocates for adopting English as an official language, and says Trump should do so. But the only news event alluded to is about the official White House website losing its Spanish translation after Trump was inaugurated. The post cites an article from the Los Angeles Times, which points out the translation option had been removed from WhiteHouse.gov on Jan. 20. As of Feb. 9, the Spanish translation of the White House website was still gone. The story making the rounds on the Internet, meanwhile, says Trump purposely directed his administration to remove the translation. Even if that were true — and there’s no solid evidence that’s the case — it’s far from making English the nation’s official language. That would require legislation through Congress, which has been proposed in the past but never became law. This incendiary headline woefully misrepresents the actual event to which it is tied.

No, Coretta Scott King didn't thank Jeff Sessions in video clip
","Coretta Scott King, the widow of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.,  died in 2006. But her opinion on the man who is now President Donald Trump’s attorney general is still being talked about today. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., tried to read a 1986 letter by Coretta Scott King that criticized Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., as the Senate was considering his confirmation for attorney general. (He was ultimately confirmed on a near-party-line vote.) Before Warren could finish reading the letter, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell successfully silenced her under an obscure Senate rule. The Senate’s decision to silence Warren energized her supporters. But it wasn’t long before conservative corners of the Internet tried to push a counter-narrative showing Coretta Scott King as favorable towards Sessions. On Feb. 8, an aggregation site called True Pundit published a post with the headline, ""SHATTERED: Video of Coretta Scott King Thanking Jeff Sessions for Rosa Parks Library Crushes Elizabeth Warren Racial Stunt."" Here’s the rest of the post, which also referenced a controversy over Warren and whether she had American Indian heritage: Well, that was quick. Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s racial stunt that sparked her removal from the senate floor Tuesday night proved even shorter than her time living in a teepee. Warren attempted to use the words of Coretta Scott King, the widow of slain civil rights hero Martin Luther King Jr., to smear Sen. Jeff Sessions’ bid for Attorney General. Warren’s now warrant-less claim was that King’s wife’s words framed Sessions as a bigot. But now a more recent video has surfaced where Coretta King in fact praises Sessions at the launching of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum. What a difference 12 hours can make. Several readers were curious about what the attached video showed, so we took a closer look. (True Pundit did not respond to an inquiry through its website.) The event in question was the Dec. 1, 2000, dedication of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum, located on the Montgomery, Ala., campus of Troy State University (since renamed Troy University). Parks had helped spark the civil rights movement in 1955 when she defied Alabama’s Jim Crow racial laws by refusing to relinquish her seat in the front of a municipal bus in Montgomery. Speakers at the dedication included Parks herself; Coretta Scott King; civil rights widow Juanita Jones Abernathy; civil rights leaders Johnnie Mae Carr, Dorothy Height, Evelyn Lowery, Elaine Steele, Mammie Till-Mobley; actor Cicely Tyson; and several elected and appointed officials, including Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, Montgomery mayor Bobby Bright, Troy State-Montgomery chancellor Jack Hawkins and president Cameron Martindale, U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, and Sessions. Here’s a transcript of what King said on the YouTube video embedded in the website. A complete video of her address has been archived by C-SPAN, starting around the 1:06:44 mark. To President Martindale, to Sen. Sessions, Mayor Bright, Troy State Chancellor Jack Hawkins Jr., Dr. Dorothy Height, Ms. Johnnie Carr, Juanita Abernathy, Mammie Till-Mobley, to all of the distinguished program participants and guests in this audience today, it's a great honor and a privilege for me to join you in celebrating the grand opening of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum. History teaches us that all great freedom movements begin with an inspiring act of courage, and in this regard the American civil rights movement provides a supreme example. The library and museum we dedicate today is a living testament to the courage, commitment and character of the great woman whose act of courage sparked our freedom struggle, the woman we call Mrs. Rosa Louise Parks. In her extraordinary courage and humility, Mrs. Rosa Parks provided our movement with a matchless example of the very spirit of non-violence. That was the only time King mentioned Sessions in her speech -- and it her words fall well short of ""thanking"" him, whether for his role in establishing the library or for anything else. She simply acknowledged his presence in the room, as she did with other dignitaries. We checked with Jeff Shesol, a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton who is now a founding partner of West Wing Writers, which does speechwriting for a variety of clients. ""This is the verbal equivalent of a wave or a handshake,"" Shesol said. ""In speechwriting, we call this the ‘acknowledgments’ section -- a list of people that you simply have to mention, in passing, given their office or stature. The sort of people who you can't risk slighting by appearing to ignore them."" Shesol said there is a separate category of salute that qualifies as a genuine thank you. ""When someone needs to be singled out and thanked for their role in something, or for their contribution or leadership, that requires the speaker to pause and say something grateful and meaningful,"" he said. And King did just that later in her speech, in a portion not shown in the YouTube clip that True Pundit appended to its post. In her remarks, King specifically thanked the Montgomery Improvement Association and Troy State University for their efforts on helping establish the library and museum. ""What you have here is a willful misinterpretation of a very basic gesture,"" Shesol said of the way True Pundit framed its post. Our ruling True Pundit said a video shows ""Coretta Scott King thanking Jeff Sessions for Rosa Parks library."" Even a cursory review of the video shows no such thing. King did acknowledge Sessions’ presence at the event, along with the presence of seven other dignitaries. But she did not go any further than mentioning his name. By contrast, she specifically thanked a local community group and the hosting university for their help in making the museum a reality. The website twists King’s actual words to a ridiculous degree, so we rate it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2017/feb/09/true-pundit/no-coretta-scott-king-didnt-thank-jeff-sessions-vi/

Trump wrong on Sen. Blumenthal's CNN interview and Vietnam

Cuomo had interviewed Blumenthal after the senator made headlines by saying that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch had told him he was ""disheartened"" by the president’s dismissive comments about federal judges. Blumenthal drew Trump’s wrath first. The president tweeted, ""Sen.Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie),now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?"" Cuomo’s turn came next. After he spoke with Blumenthal, Trump tweeted on Feb. 9, 2017, ""Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave ""service"" in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS!"" Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave ""service"" in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS! Actually, Cuomo did ask about that. CNN posted Cuomo’s interview with Blumenthal. Cuomo’s first question was: ""What is your response to the president of the United States saying you should not be believed because you misrepresented your military record in the past?"" Blumenthal didn’t answer the question. Instead, he repeated his account of what Gorsuch said to him. The interview moved on to details about the Gorsuch nomination. After Trump took his shot at Cuomo, the CNN anchor defended himself on air. ""The president, with all due respect, is once again off on the facts,"" Cuomo said.

""When we returned, we saw nothing like this,"" he said, a comparison with soldiers who came back from Vietnam. Blumenthal told the New York Times he had ""misspoken"" about his Vietnam record. In reality, between 1965 and 1970, he received at least five deferments for military service. In 1970, he obtained a slot in the Marine Reserves and was stationed in America. As we’ve reported before, Trump benefited from four student deferments in college and one medical deferment (Trump later said that was for bone spurs in his heels), before being classified 4-F, unfit to serve. Trump played baseball, tennis and squash during his college years. He once said attending a private military-style boarding school gave him ""more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military.""

Fake news dangles visa-free travel for Ghana/Malawi
","As President Donald Trump’s travel ban upended many people’s plans to come to America, fake news perpetrators saw opportunities to cash in on the news. A few days after Trump signed his executive order, a website called USA Television put up two stories. One said ""Trump signs a visa-free travel policy for Ghana"" and the other ""Trump signs a visa-free travel policy for Malawi."" The website claimed that ""the United States President, Donald Trump, has signed an executive order to allow all Ghana nationals travel to the United States without visas."" Substitute Malawi for Ghana and the two articles were identical. They even included ""news"" that Trump was on the verge of revoking Australia's visa waiver status. This is, however, nonsense. The U.S. State Department oversees the visa waiver program, and lists the eligible nations. Neither Ghana nor Malawi is on that list. In order to qualify, the visa refusal rate for a given country (meaning how often the U.S. refuses a visa request) has to be under 3 percent. The latest refusal rates for Ghana and Malawi are about 62 and 14 percent respectively. USA Television not only gets zero points for accuracy, it ranks low for creativity. The theme of Trump lifting visa requirements created a cottage industry of sorts. The earliest version we found was on a website called MetroWorlds. On Jan. 25, 2017, the site reported that Trump had signed a bill that granted waivers for Ghana, Kenya and Ethiopia. The website Lead Story flagged that as fake news. It is. As we went down the rabbit hole debunking this claim, it rapidly became hard to see who was copying whom, as USA Television churned out more versions and other sites did their own, all with the same message for citizens of Zimbabwe, Tanzania, South Africa and Nigeria. The U.S. embassies in Ghana, Kenya and Zimbabwe warned people to ignore the bogus reports. ""That story ab/ change in visa policy for Ghanaians? Still fake,"" the embassy in Ghana tweeted. Our ruling The USA Television website reported that people from Ghana and Malawi could travel to the United States without a visa. Both countries are missing from the State Department’s visa waiver list. There were many versions of this story, naming different countries. None of them were true and in the case of Ghana, the American embassy warned people not to believe these reports. So don’t believe them. We rate these claims Pants on Fire. Update Feb. 15, 2017: Sorry residents of Mauritius, Gambia, Sri Lanka and Botswana. Your pathway to visiting the United States has not gotten any easier, despite what you might have read. The fake news mill that is ""USA Television"" and ""CNN Channel"" has been churning out versions of its debunked headline ""Donald Trump signs visa-free policy for (insert country here.)""

They all say this is about fostering trade between the two nations. The U.S. State Department is the final authority on which countries enjoy visa-free status.

Does the United States tax exports but not imports?
","A couple of weeks after former Fox News Channel talk show host Greta Van Susteren started a program on MSNBC, the Appleton, Wis. native welcomed U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan to discuss what changes could be expected under President Donald Trump. When Van Susteren asked Ryan in the Jan. 25, 2017 interview about the ""tax code"" (which Ryan has errantly claimed hasn’t been updated in 30 years), the Janesville, Wis., Republican emphasized the need to reduce business tax rates (which Trump has accurately characterized as high). Then Ryan said: ""Oh, and by the way, here's what the rest of the world does that we don't do: They take the tax off of their exports and place a tax on their imports. We do the opposite. We tax our exports and don't tax our imports. So, we're putting ourselves -- we’re basically double taxing made-in-America products."" Does the United States tax exports but not tax imports? Both parts of the speaker’s claim, said Joel Trachtman, professor of international law at the Fletcher School at Tufts University in Massachusetts, are ""in principle true, but there’s a lot of important exceptions."" The backdrop Taxes on imports and exports are important given that Trump has been highly critical of America’s trade policies. Three days after his inauguration, he signed a presidential memorandum officially directing the United States to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the biggest trade deal struck in two decades. That earned him a Promise Kept on PolitiFact National’s Trump-O-Meter. Now to the first part of Ryan’s two-part claim. ‘We tax our exports’ There is no excise tax or tariff applied by the United States on goods sold to foreign customers. But Ryan’s point is that U.S. businesses pay income taxes on their worldwide income -- that is, from exports as well as goods sold within the United States. It’s worth noting, though, that multinational companies are often able to reduce or delay their payment of U.S. taxes on export-based income. And U.S. exporters also enjoy subsidies and other assistance from some 20 federal agencies. So, the first part of the statement is mostly on target. We ‘don’t tax our imports’ Ryan’s point here is that a foreign company that sells goods from abroad into the United States does not pay any U.S. income taxes unless it has subsidiaries based in the United States or branches in the United States. For example, Toyota USA pays income taxes on cars made in Japan that it buys and resells to U.S. consumers. But his statement ignores the existence of tariffs -- another form of tax that is imposed on many goods as they come into the United States. On average, the tariff imposed at the border is 1.5 percent, according to a March 2016 report from the U.S. International Trade Commission. (Tariffs are aimed at making American companies more competitive with their foreign counterparts, but consumer costs in the United States almost certainly would rise if tariffs are increased. Trump has promised to raise tariffs on ""any country that devalues their currency to take unfair advantage of the United States."") Ryan’s office acknowledged to us that tariffs are another form of tax, but pointed out that he had been asked about the tax code, which is administered by the Internal Revenue Service rather than the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. So, the second part of the claim is misleading in that there are no direct taxes on imports, but there are tariffs. Our rating Ryan said: In the United States, ""we tax our exports and don't tax our imports."" On the export side, the United States doesn’t have an excise tax or tariffs on goods sold to foreign customers. But U.S. businesses do pay income taxes on their exports -- though multinational companies have the means to mitigate those taxes. On the import side, foreign companies don’t pay income taxes on goods they sell to the United States, but tariffs -- another form of tax -- are imposed on many imported goods. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.",/factchecks/2017/feb/09/paul-ryan/does-united-states-tax-exports-not-imports/

Does Melania Trump's security detail cost more than federal arts budget?
","Grumbling about the first family’s taxpayer-funded trips and expenses is a time-honored political tradition, no matter the party of the president. Former President Ronald Reagan's two-week stay in Santa Barbara, Calif., ran up a Air Force One tab of at least $250,000 in 1981. President Barack Obama’s golf getaways were the subject of constant conservative consternation. Enter President Donald Trump, the tweeter in chief. People are turning to Trump’s favorite social medium to complain about tax dollars spent protecting first lady Melania Trump and son Barron, who still live in Trump Tower in New York. One common comparison we’ve seen says that Melania Trump’s security detail at Trump Tower costs more than the annual budget for the National Endowment for the Arts, which the administration reportedly has considered eliminating altogether. Melania Trump staying at Trump Tower instead of the White House:$182,500,000/yearBudget National Endowment for the Arts:$149,849,000/year The estimated security cost for Melania Trump living 200 miles away from Donald Trump is double the annual budget for the NEA. @NEAarts Cost of security detail 4 keeping @MELANIATRUMP in New York is 2x annual budget of @NEAarts #NationalEndowmentoftheArts @realDonaldTrump We wanted to know how the argument held up. Problem is, there’s no good number for how much Melania Trump’s New York security detail costs. We’ll start with what we know: The National Endowment for the Arts’ budget was a little under $148 million for fiscal year 2016, and it’s requested a budget of about $150 million for fiscal year 2017, according to its website. To top the 2016 amount, Melania and Barron would need to stay at Trump Tower for an entire year with a detail costing more than $405,000 a day. To beat the 2017 budget request, the security costs would need to exceed $410,000 a day. During the transition period, the city took on most of the cost of protecting the Trumps in New York. A spokesperson for New York mayor Bill de Blasio told us Donald, Melania and Barron Trump ran up a $37 million bill for security from Election Day to the inauguration Jan. 20. (De Blasio has requested the federal government reimburse his city for security costs, and Congress has doled about $7 million.) In comparison, the city of Chicago spent at least $2.2 million to protect Obama’s home in Chicago from his election in November 2008 to his inauguration in January 2009, the Chicago Tribune reported. CBS’ New York affiliate reported, based on anonymous sources, that the city spends $500,000 a day to protect Trump Tower when the president is there, but less when it’s just Melania and Barron. That figure, de Blasio spokesperson Freddi Goldstein said, likely refers to the daily cost of security ($37 million divided by 74 days). But the mayor’s office has yet to complete an estimate for the cost of the first lady and Barron’s security detail alone, and believes it’ll be less than $500,000 a day. Goldstein told us even if the president were visiting New York, the price tag would likely be less today as much of the activity outside Trump Tower has dissipated since the first months of his election. Trump told reporters in November that his wife and youngest son would join him at the White House ""very soon, after he’s finished with school,"" which indicate a mid-year move. The White House said this month that Melania Trump will move to the White House at the end of the school year and split time between New York and Washington. Our ruling Social media posts say Melania Trump’s security detail at Trump Tower costs more than the annual budget for the National Endowment for the Arts. That’s a flawed projection based on incomplete data. It assumes that Melania and Barron Trump will stay at Trump Tower the entire year, racking up a security bill of more than $410,000 a day, every day. But officials say the Melania Trump and her son intend to move to the White House at the end of the school year and split time between Washington and New York. What the first family will actually do we don’t know. But neither do bloggers. They should back off this claim until there is more data. We rate it Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2017/feb/08/social-media/does-melania-trumps-security-detail-cost-more-fede/

Senate Republicans did not use Rule 19 when Ted Cruz attacked Mitch McConnell
","Senate Democrats attacked their GOP colleagues for using a procedural regulation to shut down Elizabeth Warren’s criticism of a fellow senator, but not when Texas Republican Ted Cruz did the same thing two years ago. During a Feb. 8 CNN interview, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., excoriated Republicans for invoking Rule 19 the day before to force Warren to stop her floor speech against Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, President Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general. Warren, D-Mass., had been reading a 1986 letter by Coretta Scott King that protested Sessions’ failed appointment as a federal judge in Alabama. The letter from King said Sessions ""has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge."" During Warren’s speech, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky cited Rule 19, which prevents senators from impugning one another. Senators voted along party lines to silence Warren, a move Shaheen said was hypocritical. ""Back when Ted Cruz called Mitch McConnell a liar on the floor of the Senate floor, nobody invoked Rule 19 to censor him, so this has been a very subjective process,"" Shaheen said. Cruz did take to the Senate floor in 2015 to accuse McConnell of lying to him. While other Republicans did admonish Cruz for doing so, the rule that silenced Warren was not invoked. ‘A simple lie’ According to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, Rule 19 says in part that ""no Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator."" Shaheen and other Democrats argued that if the rule applies to Warren, it also should have applied to a July 24, 2015, speech by Cruz. He took to the Senate floor to castigate McConnell for allegedly making a private deal with some senators to allow a vote to renew the charter for the Export-Import Bank in exchange for votes on a trade deal. Cruz and many other Republicans oppose the bank, which acts as the nation’s official credit agency to help businesses find foreign markets. After McConnell moved a proposal to reauthorize the bank through a transportation bill, Cruz went on the attack. Cruz said McConnell had told him there was no such deal — ""Like Saint Peter, he repeated it three times,"" Cruz said — but Cruz’s office staff had said McConnell was lying. ""I cannot believe he would tell a flat-out lie. ... What we just saw today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press over and over and over again, was a simple lie,"" Cruz said. So Cruz didn’t specifically use the word ""liar"" to describe McConnell, an important caveat. But he did make it very clear that, according to Cruz’s account, McConnell had told him and others a lie. McConnell denied the charge, saying he had held the position that the transportation bill would be the best opportunity to hold a vote on renewing the bank’s charter (it passed). We didn’t find any evidence that anyone in the Senate moved to silence Cruz with Rule 19. But Republicans did denounce his attack on the party leader as improper in the days following. ""I think it was outside the realm of Senate behavior,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told CNN a couple of days later. ""I would never contemplate going to the floor of the Senate and impugning the integrity of another senator. Just not something we do here. I really think it was a very wrong thing to do."" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, then the Senate president pro tempore, suggested in a date floor speech that Cruz may have been grandstanding to draw attention to his presidential bid. ""Squabbling and sanctimony may be tolerated in other venues — or perhaps on the campaign trail — but they have no place among colleagues in the United States Senate,"" Hatch said. ""The Senate floor has even become a place where senators have singled out colleagues by name to attack them in personal terms, to impugn their character, in blatant disregard for Senate rules."" No senator defended Cruz’s speech, and he was defeated by his own party on several procedural maneuvers in the days after he spoke. His Texas colleague, GOP Sen. John Cornyn, even questioned Cruz’s recollection of events, noting he ""would have to say he's mistaken"" about what McConnell said. Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political science professor, further noted to us that the Senate majority leader isn’t the only senator who can invoke Rule 19. ""(What Cruz said) was definitely a violation of the norms of the Senate and he was not called to account,"" Koger said. ""I would just say that any senator — including any Democrat or any Republican — could have called him on it."" Our ruling Shaheen said, ""Back when Ted Cruz called Mitch McConnell a liar on the floor of the Senate floor, nobody invoked Rule 19 to censor him."" Cruz didn't call him a ""liar,"" exactly, but he did say in a 2015 floor speech that McConnell had told him a lie about whether the Senate majority leader had made a deal to renew the Export-Import Bank’s charter. Republicans chastised Cruz afterward, saying it was not the proper thing to do. But he was not silenced under Rule 19.

Yes, ExxonMobil under Tillerson fought oil payment disclosure rule
","A resolution on President Donald Trump’s desk would kill a regulation the oil lobby has opposed for six years. The rule by the Securities and Exchange Commission requires oil, gas and mining companies to report pretty much everything they pay to governments for the right to extract resources. The rule’s goal was to prevent corruption in developing countries where top officials might feather their nests and leave their people destitute. House Republicans, joined by a handful of Democrats, voted to nullify the rule on Feb. 1, and two days later on a straight party-line vote, the Senate followed suit. During the debate on the Senate floor, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said the transparency under the regulation was an ""essential tool"" against fraud and abuse, but it had powerful enemies. ""Since the rule’s creation, ExxonMobil, led by Mr. Tillerson -- now the secretary of state -- and Big Oil allies, such as the American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the Heritage Foundation, have fought to kill it,"" Brown said. We decided to explore whether ExxonMobil fought to kill the rule. It did, and Tillerson played a direct role. The action began in 2008. That year, then Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., spearheaded a report on corruption in developing nations rooted in their natural resources. In the most extreme cases, money from oil or other resources set off a scramble for personal wealth that left nations in Africa, South America and Asia less stable and deeper in poverty. Transparency, Lugar wrote, was crucial to beating the ""resource curse."" ""When oil revenue in a producing country can be easily tracked, that nation’s elite are more likely to use revenues for the vital needs of their citizens and less likely to squander newfound wealth for self-aggrandizing projects,"" he wrote. Lugar wanted a law that would tell the SEC to craft a rule for companies to follow. He co-sponsored an amendment with Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., that became part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul bill in 2010. Under the measure, any oil, gas or mining company listed on the U.S. stock exchange had to report ""taxes, royalties, fees (including license fees), production entitlements, bonuses, and other material benefits,"" paid to any government. The reporting had to be done country by country and project by project. ExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade group, opposed the proposal every step of the way. In 2010, Jay Branegan worked for Lugar as a staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Now at the Lugar Center, a policy group in Washington, D.C., Branegan told us that in 2010, before Dodd-Frank passed, Tillerson himself came to Lugar’s office to argue against the amendment. ""He listed a number of his and the industry’s objections to the bill, including that it would harm Exxon’s relations with Russia,"" Branegan said. ""He was the only CEO to come in to lobby personally."" We asked ExxonMobil spokesman William Holbrook for the company’s take on the accuracy of Branegan’s account. Holbrook said, ""The SEC rule has been a concern for the industry at large, not ExxonMobil exclusively."" Holbrook argued that the rule put ExxonMobil at a competitive disadvantage with state-owned companies and that ""ExxonMobil is committed to being a good corporate citizen, and part of that commitment includes transparency in reporting payments to foreign governments."" ""The SEC largely ignored industry’s comments and recommendations in finalizing its rule,"" Holbrook said. ExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute had several changes in mind but a key one had to do with the details the SEC reported to the public. Ideally, they wanted the SEC to lump all payments a government received together, rather than show what each company paid. They certainly didn’t want to report for each project. ExxonMobil voiced its objections in letters to the SEC on Jan. 31, 2011, March 15, 2011  and Oct. 25, 2011. The SEC actually went through two cycles in writing the rules. After the SEC came up with version one, a lawsuit sent the commission back to the drawing board. The second try wrapped up June 27, 2016. As recently as March 2016, ExxonMobil raised objections to the revised approach, saying the SEC plan would increase costs, harm shareholders and ""sow confusion."" Not all major oil companies objected so vigorously to the rule. Royal Dutch Shell wrote, ""While we believe the American Petroleum Institute proposal is superior to the Commission’s re-proposal, we would support the Commission re-proposal with certain minor changes."" BP took the same line. A key factor for Shell and BP was that all 28 European Union countries, plus Canada and Norway, had already adopted disclosure rules modeled on the original SEC version. The two companies wanted to be able to give the SEC the same reports they were filing in the EU. The SEC adopted that. Jana Morgan, director of Publish What You Pay, an advocacy group that supports mandatory reporting, told us the nullification of the American rule would put the country in an odd position. ""Canada and countries in Europe adopted similar legislation to the United States because the United States passed it first,"" Morgan said. ""Assuming the regulation is pulled back, the United States will be out of sync with the global transparency standard."" Our ruling Brown said ExxonMobil fought to kill a rule requiring oil and mining companies to disclose payments made to governments. Former ExxonMobil CEO Tillerson personally lobbied against the measure before it became law, and the company continued to oppose it as recently as March 2016. ExxonMobil preferred a different reporting regime, rather than no reporting at all, but its opposition was steadfast.

"['National', 'Crime', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump wrong that murder rate is highest in 47 years
","One of President Donald Trump’s biggest campaign themes was that the United States is experiencing a crime plague of historical proportions. On Feb. 7, the newly elected chief executive invited a group of county sheriffs to the White House -- and proceeded to cite a startling crime statistic. ""The murder rate in our country is the highest it’s been in 47 years, right?"" Trump said. ""Did you know that? Forty-seven years. I used to use that -- I’d say that in a speech and everybody was surprised, because the press doesn’t tell it like it is. It wasn’t to their advantage to say that. But the murder rate is the highest it’s been in, I guess, from 45 to 47 years."" There’s a reason the press didn’t tout that figure — the statement was incorrect. Trump has, on occasion, accurately stated a statistic along these lines. A day after talking with the sheriffs, Trump offered a more accurate version of this statistic during an address to the Major Cities Chiefs Association winter conference. And during the second presidential debate, Trump said, ""We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years."" However, there’s a difference between saying the country’s largest cities experienced their biggest annual increase in homicides in more than four decades (as Trump said during the debate) and saying that the country is experiencing its highest murder rate overall in more than four decades (as he told the sheriffs). The national homicide rate is considerably lower than its peak in the 1990s: The chart does show a clear spike between 2014 and 2015, but it’s not enough to reverse a decades-long trend in the national homicide rate. The preliminary statistics for 2016 -- which are not an apples-to-apples comparison to the full-year numbers used in this graph -- suggest that homicides rose once again between 2015 and 2016, by 5.2 percent. But what’s also clear in this graph is that the overall homicide rate -- even accounting for the upward bumps in 2015 and potentially in 2016 -- is nowhere near the peak levels of the 1990s. The following graph shows raw totals (not rates) for murders going back to 1971. This graph shows the same peak period -- the early 1990s. Specifically, the number of murders declined by 42 percent between 1993 and 2014, even as the U.S. population rose by 25 percent over the same period. So while homicides have recently risen -- a legitimate concern, experts say -- they are far below their high levels of the early 1990s, when the nation’s population was much smaller. ""Violent crime rates are up compared with historic lows, and they are still very, very low compared with just five or 10 years ago,"" Raymond Paternoster, a University of Maryland criminologist, told us in October. Alan Lizotte, a University at Albany criminologist, agreed. ""A small increase between two time points is not an increase when the 20-year trend is downward,"" he said in October. ""If it went on for several years, it might indicate an increase."" Our ruling Trump told the sheriffs, ""The murder rate in our country is the highest it’s been in 47 years."" Actually, the highest murder rates in recent memory occurred during the early 1990s; after that, the rate fell dramatically until 2014, at which point it ticked up. That uptick did represent the biggest single-year rise in more than four decades, but that’s very different than what Trump said. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2017/feb/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-murder-rate-highest-47-years/
"['Housing', 'California', 'Chad Mayes']","
MOSTLY FALSE: Claim Calif. lawmakers can’t afford housing distorts the truth
","Is housing in California so expensive that even state lawmakers are priced out? That’s the claim from Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes. ""Legislators themselves cannot afford to buy housing in California,"" Mayes, who represents parts of San Bernardino and Riverside counties, said at a forum hosted by the Public Policy Institute of California on Jan. 17, 2017.  Assemblyman Chad Mayes makes his claim at about the 11:30 minute mark in this video. The forum offered legislative leaders a chance to speak about their top priorities. Mayes said reducing the state’s housing costs and its high share of poverty are among his top goals. There’s no doubt California is an expensive place to live. And its housing market has experienced a strong rebound following the Great Recession. But is it fair to say California’s state lawmakers — who receive the highest base salary of any state legislators in the country at $104,000 — can’t afford a home in the Golden State? We set out on a fact check. Our research Several economists pointed us to the California Association of Realtors Traditional Housing Affordability Index. It lists California’s median priced single-family home at $515,940, noting the minimum qualifying income to reasonably afford that home is $100,290. For condos, the median price is $418,230 with a minimum qualifying income of $81,290. All figures are based on home sales data from the third quarter in 2016, the most recent period available.  SOURCE: California Association of Realtors Traditional Housing Affordability Index. As a comparison, Zillow.com lists the median home value in California at $485,800, through December 31, 2016. On the realtors index, the qualifying income figures assume homebuyers spend no more than one-third of their income on housing, make a 20 percent down payment, and pay the national average interest rate, plus principal, interest, property tax and homeowner’s insurance. Based on their salaries, and the supplemental pay lawmakers receive, it’s clear California state lawmakers can afford the state’s median single-family home or condo, and less expensive homes. Notably, California’s state lawmakers receive up to $35,000 per year in per diem to cover their costs while working in Sacramento, including housing. Their flights to and from their districts are also paid by the state. High coastal costs When we asked Mayes’ office for evidence to back up his claim, his spokesman Matt Mahon told us the assemblyman is correct if we consider the cost ""to buy a home in a number of California cities."" That’s different from Mayes’ blanket statement that ""Legislators themselves cannot afford to buy housing in California."" But, for some context, we decided to examine the range of home costs in the state. The realtors association index places a median priced single family home in the San Francisco Bay Area at $785,980 with a corresponding minimum qualifying income at $152,780. In San Diego, those figures are $589,260 and $114,540, respectively. Prices in other coastal cities, from Santa Cruz to Santa Barbara to Ventura, are also considerably higher than the median. State lawmakers, assuming they earned close to base pay, were the sole income earners in their household and had no additional sources of income, would find fewer affordable homes in these markets. ""It just depends on where they come from. Maybe in the big cities they would struggle,"" said Anna Scherbina, an associate professor at the UC Davis Graduate School of Management, who studies investment management and behavioral finance. ""If Mayes wants to buy a home in Santa Barbara or San Mateo then, yes, he will have some problems. But if he's looking to buy in Bakersfield, the Central Valley, or South Sacramento, he's not going to have too much of a problem,"" added Jesus Hernandez, who lectures at the UC Davis sociology department and has written about housing. ""Mayes is trying to make a point that housing prices are sky high again making it difficult for even middle class folks to buy. And he does have a valid concern.""  Members of the California State Assembly take the oath of office.  File photo / Capital Public Radio  Prices away from the coast Taking another look at the realtors’ index, they show the median price of a single family home in Bakersfield was $224,670, with a minimum qualifying income of $43,670. For Sacramento, the median price was $327,040 with a minimum income of $63,570. In the Inland Empire, which includes much of Mayes’ district, the median price was $318,960 which requires a minimum salary of $62,000. State lawmaker salaries are on the high-end, not just for lawmakers across the country, but for anyone in California. The state’s median household income was $61,818 in 2015 dollars, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Through the third quarter of 2016, just 31 percent of homebuyers in California could afford to purchase the state’s median-priced single family home, according to the realtors’ index. It was the 14th consecutive quarter that the index has been below 40 percent. In addition to their state salaries, many legislators collect income from the small businesses they own, from stocks and rental properties, according to a check of their statements of economic interests. Many also list household income generated by their spouses. Our ruling Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes recently claimed: ""Legislators themselves cannot afford to buy housing in California."" Mayes has a point when considering some of California’s priciest coastal cities. In the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, it would take a minimum salary of $152,000 to afford a median priced single family home, well above the $104,000 base pay for state legislators. But Mayes did not make this qualification. Instead, he declared legislators in general can’t afford California homes. Based on data from the California Association of Realtors Traditional Housing Affordability Index, that’s just not the case. At $515,000, California’s median priced single family home is expensive. But the salary to reasonably afford that home is $100,290, less than a legislator’s base pay. Many, though not necessarily all, lawmakers have other sources of income including the income of a spouse, or from owning a small business, that would increase their purchasing power.

"['Health Care', 'Wisconsin', 'Tammy Baldwin']","
Tammy Baldwin: Republicans are 'organizing to take people’s health care away'
","Does the GOP want to take away your health care? That’s what U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison, claimed in a Jan. 6, 2017 interview with Wisconsin Public Television. Republicans, Baldwin said, are ""organizing to take people’s health care away."" Asked for backup, a Baldwin spokesperson said the senator’s comment was in reference to plans from congressional Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare after former President Barack Obama, who played a key role in crafting the law. It’s no secret that many in the GOP have long opposed Obamacare and have campaigned on promises to dismantle it. Indeed, there has been some recent action to that end: In January, the House and Senate took preliminary steps to abolish the ACA and about a week later President Donald Trump directed federal agencies to limit its reach. But leading Republicans have also said they intend to enact replacement legislation still aimed at providing people with health coverage. How does that all square with Baldwin’s statement that Republicans are ""organizing to take people’s health care away."" Let’s take a look. Repeal and replace Baldwin’s statement posits that Republican intervention will result in people losing access to health care, an assumption that is supported by some evidence. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported in January 2017 — after Baldwin made the claim — that 18 million people would be uninsured within a year if key portions of the law were repealed. The office further projected that number would grow to 32 million people by 2026. But there’s more to the story. The congressional report was exclusively focused on the impact of abolishing Obamacare and did not consider replacement legislation. Moreover, prominent Republicans have repeatedly said they would seek to replace the law with an alternative: • Days after he was elected in November, Trump said the ACA ""will be repealed and replaced."" He later told The Washington Post in January: ""We’re going to have insurance for everybody."" • U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, has said that his goal is ""to give everyone access to affordable insurance."" A white paper Ryan’s office released in June 2015 also said that House Republicans aimed to ""provide all Americans with health care that is accessible, affordable and sustainable."" The plan includes two popular features of the Affordable Care Act: covering people with pre-existing conditions and allowing young adults to stay on their parents' plan until age 26. • Baldwin’s Wisconsin counterpart, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Oshkosh, told public radio in January 2017: ""Nobody here wants to pull out the rug from under people, leave them high and dry without access to quality health care. It's a goal we all share. We should concentrate on that. Everybody wants every American to have access to affordable and quality health care."" Republicans have yet to fully devise and agree on a replacement to Obamacare, although in January a pair of GOP senators introduced one alternative measure. The legislation would essentially let states keep using the ACA if they want; develop a new alternative system that would be eligible for some federal funding; or opt against any federal aid. Still, Baldwin’s claim is not supported by what congressional Republicans have said and done thus far. Our rating Baldwin said that Republicans are ""organizing to take people's health care away."" While the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that repeal of the Affordable Care Act could result in millions of people losing their health insurance, that finding did not examine the effect of any replacement legislation. Prominent congressional Republicans — and Trump — have repeatedly said they intend to propose alternative legislation that would aim to give all people access to health care. For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate Baldwin’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/feb/08/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-republicans-are-organizing-take-peop/

Treasurer candidate Ernest Almonte says he was speaking out on pension reform 17 years ago
","Next to jobs and the economy, public employee pensions have been among the biggest issues in many 2014 political campaigns. Ernest Almonte, an independent running for general treasurer, was asked during an interview that aired Oct. 5, 2014 on the second half of WLNE's ""On the Record"" whether the 2011 overhaul of Rhode Island’s state pension system went far enough. ""First of all,"" Almonte said, ""I was speaking out on pension reform almost 17 years ago, warning elected officials that if you didn't take care of this problem, it would take draconian measures"" to fix it. As a ""matter of fact,"" he said, ""it got to the point of saying that, 'If you're not going to fix this, you should start, (instead of) sending your children and grandchildren birthday cards and Christmas cards, you should just send them invoices and just tell them the truth: You're passing on your debt to them,' So something had to be done."" We wondered whether Almonte, who served as Rhode Island's Auditor General from 1994 to 2010, was prescient enough to be warning about problems with Rhode Island’s public pension systems 17 years ago, and what kinds of reforms he was saying were needed. Almonte’s campaign sent us several documents from the auditor general's office. Only a few go back to late 1990s and the relevant ones dealt with pension payment problems in individual communities, not state employees. One was a 1998 letter to Coventry's treasurer saying that some of the town's pension plans ""have insufficient assets to meet projected benefits."" That was 16 years ago. Another was a 1998 copy of a report by the Johnston Financial Review Commission, which Almonte chaired, warning that the town owed $3.2 million in required pension contributions for its employees. For example, Johnston hadn't paid into the firemen's pension fund for more than three years, putting it more than $1.3 million behind in its payments. We note that Almonte's comments in both of these reports are in dry auditor language. Some readers might not take that as the type of scary warning that Almonte says he made. But we also found a May 8, 1988 front-page Providence Journal story reporting how Almonte explained to more than 200 Johnston residents that their town was in deep financial trouble. ""To drive home the severity of the situation,"" the story said, ""Almonte gave examples that sometimes made the audience wince: A bottom-of-the-barrel credit rating. A time between April 1996 and March 1997 when the town's bank account was overdrawn for 146 days. Falling behind $3.19 million in required pension contributions for workers. ""And that's not all, Almonte said. Still to be reckoned with is an unfunded pension liability that hasn't been quantified, and could add up to untold millions,"" the story reported. Almonte's campaign also referred us to a March 1999 report, available on the Auditor General's website, for the 1997 fiscal year. It notes that ""five school districts, five municipalities and three police and fire units were delinquent"" to the tune of about $1.7 million in their pension payments. The state withheld school aid and traffic fine payments to six municipalities until they paid up. That was 15 years ago. If Almonte wasn't warning about a looming crisis in the state pension system in those days, that's because there wasn't one. His 2000 audit of the state Employees' Retirement System, covering the fiscal year that ended in 1999, reported that the funded ratios -- the amount of money each plan had compared to the amount of money it was expected to need to cover its pension costs -- had been growing steadily for years. The ratio for state employees, for example, went from 73 percent in 1993 to 81 percent in 1998. In addition, all the plans had been getting the recommended amount of funding since at least 1996 and, in many cases, even longer. That would change. By 2006, the funded ratio for that plan had dropped to 55 percent. By 2009, it had only gone up to 59 percent and the debate about pension costs was poised to explode. We found no documentation from that era suggesting Almonte was advocating the type of sweeping changes to the separate pension plans for state employees and teachers that were pushed by General Treasurer Gina Raimondo and approved by the General Assembly and Governor Lincoln Chafee. In an interview, Almonte argued that he was talking about the state's pension problem at the time  because late payments he was referring to were payments by cities and towns to the state-run Municipal Employees' Retirement System, also known as MERS, which is under the jurisdiction of the state treasurer. ""Reform is not just what you to do an employee or an employee's benefits,"" he said. ""I was advocating a reform of management"" to get the communities to make their payments on time, especially when the money being withheld by workers to help pay for pension benefits is being retained by the city or town. ""When payments are made late, you miss out on earnings, and that's the start of the problem because the problem compounds itself."" Our ruling Ernest Almonte said, ""I was speaking out on pension reform almost 17 years ago."" The comment was in the context of a question on the state's pension system. It’s clear from documentation Almonte provided and information we found that Almonte was warning about problems years ago. But the documentation he could provide only dealt with problems in municipal plans, although some of those were in the MERS system run by the state. Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rule it Mostly True.

","Republican Gov. Nathan Deal has a new television ad out that says his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Jason Carter, plans to go on a spending spree if elected. It’s part of the GOP’s strategy to paint Democrats as the tax-and-spend party. ""Jason Carter’s plan: increase spending by $12.5 billion,"" the ad’s narrator says at one point. That’s a head-turning forecast given that the state’s annual budget is about $21 billion. PolitiFact decided to review this one further. Deal spokeswoman Jen Talaber said the governor’s campaign developed the $12.5 billion projection based on Carter’s pledges to restore full funding to k-12 education and expand Medicaid. School systems have not been fully funded by the state since 2003. That’s become a major issue in this year’s governor’s race. Austerity cuts to education this year are about $747 million, and that’s better than the recent past. Talaber said the $12.5 billion forecast assumes that Carter will spend $1 billion a year in each of the next 10 years, $10 billion total, to fully restore education funding. But that also assumes Carter, if elected governor, would serve more than the two-term maximum (eight years) the law allows. Second, it assumes that the Legislature, now in Republican control, would follow his recommendation and approve the money every year. Lastly, at least for next year, the $1 billion is off the mark. Although adjustments have to be made for factors such as enrollment growth, school systems would need about $747 million to be fully funded, based on the extra money put into education this year on Deal’s recommendation. The campaign does the same thing with its math for Georgia’s cost to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. It’s $2.5 billion projection is for a decade, not a single year. That makes the figure disingenuous on its face. But the number does exist, in a 2012 Kaiser Family Foundation study that focused on the ACA's Medicaid expansion plan. If states sign up, the federal government pays all the costs for newly eligible enrollees in 2015 and 2016 and no less than 90 percent thereafter. A similar state study projected the cost to be about $2.1 billion – still in the same general range. Missing from the spending claim: the $31 billion to $35 billion in federal money that will come back into Georgia under expansion. In other words, Georgia’s spending would create a 17-fold return on investment in actual dollars. The state study projects the spending also would stimulate $65 billion in economic activity over the decade. ""To say that the state is going to have to come up with $2.5 billion on its own is incorrect. There will be extra money coming back from the federal government,"" said William S. Custer, the author of the state report and director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University. Deal has adamantly opposed expansion and say there’s little reason to believe the debt-ridden federal government will continue to pay 90 percent of the costs far into the future. Further complicating the math, Georgia must spend some of the $2 billion projection, even without expansion, to meet ACA requirements. But without expansion, there is no counterbalance of federal money. And, from a state budget standpoint, there also are areas where expansion could cut spending. The studies don’t count cost reductions in state-funded health care to those who are incarcerated or in some mental health programs, who could be transferred to an expanded Medicaid program. The state has not done the calculations to determine the potential savings, which would likely need to be done on a case-by-case basis to determine Medicaid eligibility, said Timothy Sweeney, director of health policy at the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. Still, Sweeney said ""substantial savings"" could be achieved. ""We are serving these people already, with state funding,"" Sweeney said. ""It’s clear that transferring that service to federal funding would cut state costs."" Those figures help prompt many health care leaders in Georgia to push for expansion. State lawmakers, though, backed Deal’s stance that expansion would be a fiscal trap by passing House Bill 990 last spring. The measure requires the GOP-controlled General Assembly to approve any expansion of Medicaid ""through an increase in the income threshold."" That leaves a loophole for Georgia to expand the program only via a loophole such as Arkansas did, by using the federal subsidy to buy private health care insurance, not Medicaid. That more or less leaves the fate of Medicaid expansion – and the potential costs – in the hands of the Legislature, not the governor. The ad says Carter’s plans will result in taxes on small businesses and the middle class, something Carter flatly denies. It calls Carter ""silver tongued"" and ""untrustworthy."" Carter says additional funding for education will come from cuts in government waste, recovery of delinquent taxes and economic growth. That’s typical campaign banter. (We’ve ruled Half True a claim by Carter that education funding can be increased significantly if the state goes after $2.5 billion in delinquent taxes. But what about the ad claim that Carter’s plan will cost $12.5 billion? Those cost projections cannot be taken seriously. They are for a period of 10 years -- longer than Carter could legally be in office. They leave out other critical facts -- like lawmakers would have to sign off on any major spending. We rate the ad claim as False.

Was SARS worse than Ebola? Tavis Smiley says so
","In an attempt to tamp down panic, some have compared the current Ebola outbreak to past epidemics -- particularly the SARS outbreak of 2003. On ABC’s This Week Oct. 19, talk show host Tavis Smiley said that those who think President Barack Obama’s response to Ebola is too soft are blowing the situation out of proportion. For context, they should remember the outbreak of SARS -- sudden acute respiratory syndrome -- 10 years ago. Talking to Republican strategist Mary Matalin, Smiley said, ""This is not as bad as SARS was in 2003, and everybody wants to pile on, Mary, like you did on all the things Obama has done wrong. I've been a critic on certain issues, but this is not the president's fault."" Is Smiley right that SARS in 2003 was worse than today’s Ebola crisis? Well, it depends on the context. We talked to experts and found that looking at the Ebola and SARS outbreaks in their points of origin -- West Africa and Hong Kong, respectively -- Ebola has been more destructive. SARS, on the other hand, had a wider global reach than Ebola. ""It depends on what’s your gauge for ‘worse,’ "" said Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. Several experts told us that the potential for the Ebola outbreak to grow -- and the humanitarian toll on West Africa -- makes it more worrisome. A note: Either way, Ebola does not pose a significant threat to the United States, though it may be damaging to other countries. The effects To start off, here’s some World Health Organization data comparing the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the current Ebola outbreak as of Oct. 17. SARS -- 2003 Ebola -- 2014 Number of countries affected 25+ 7 Number of cases (global) 8,096 9,216 Health worker cases (global) 1,706 423 Number of deaths (global) 774 4,555 Mortality rate 9.6 percent 50 percent Number of cases (U.S.) 27 3 Cases contracted in U.S. 0 2 Number of deaths (U.S.) 0 1 Proven treatments None None So by the numbers, Ebola is significantly more deadly. Also, there already are more cases worldwide. That said, SARS is much more communicable than Ebola, meaning it is easier to catch. It can spread through a sneeze, cough, sharing a beverage or speaking up close with someone who has the disease. It is also possible that SARS travels through the air. Ebola, on the other hand, is not airborne. Experts say it only possible to get Ebola by coming into direct contact with the body fluids of someone who is sick. In sum, SARS spread to many more countries than Ebola has so far. However, there have been more cases of Ebola, and the death toll is much higher. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention anticipates that the number of cases in West Africa could reach the hundreds of thousands by January. ""Both are substantial public health outbreaks"" said Dr. David Weber, an expert in epidemiology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. ""(It’s) not really useful to try to determine which is worse."" From the perspective of a United States citizen considering the two diseases’ impact here, Smiley’s statement might have more weight, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. Many more cases of SARS made it to the United States than Ebola cases so far. (though there were no SARS deaths). It’s also important to remember that the largest focal point of the SARS outbreak (other than Hong Kong) was Toronto -- which brought the disease a little more close to home, Schaffner said. There were 251 SARS cases and 43 deaths in Canada. Even if the number of Ebola cases in the United States is low -- and lower than the number of SARS cases -- Smiley is incorrect because of the overall humanitarian impact of Ebola when compared to that of SARS, said Dr. Howard Markel, director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan. ""In terms of U.S. (Ebola) cases, it is still minimal,"" Markel said. ""If you're in West Africa, it's a nightmare and very serious, and far more deadly already than SARS was.""   Our ruling Smiley said Ebola ""is not as bad as SARS was in 2003."" Both diseases are serious and have harmed communities. SARS spread to more countries and is easier to transmit than Ebola. But Ebola has had more cases and higher death toll, and those numbers continue to rise. SARS may have had more of a presence in the United States, but Ebola is poised to be a larger humanitarian crisis globally. We rate Smiley’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/19/tavis-smiley/tavis-smiley-says-ebola-outbreak-not-bad-sars-outb/

George Will says a sneeze or cough could spread Ebola
","As the national effort ramps up to beat back Ebola, the Obama administration has been taking heat. Critics say the president and top public health officials painted too rosy a picture of the country’s state of readiness. As proof, they point to the infection of two Dallas health care workers who treated the first person to die of Ebola on U.S. soil. Conservative pundit George Will attacked what to him was the hubris in those early statements. ""The problem is the original assumption, said with great certitude if not certainty, was that you need to have direct contact, meaning with bodily fluids from someone because it’s (Ebola) not airborne,"" Will said Oct. 19 on Fox News Sunday. ""There are doctors who are saying that in a sneeze or some cough, some of the airborne particles can be infectious."" Will also said Ebola could survive on a dry surface ""for a number of days."" Show host Chris Wallace cut Will off, asserting that Ebola does not spread like the flu, which does move from person to person when someone with the illness is out in public. When another guest challenged Will to cite his source, he ultimately referred to scientists at the University of Minnesota. Here, we’re fact-checking Will’s claim that scientists say a cough or sneeze can spread Ebola. From the context of the discussion, we understand that Will was talking about the risk to the general public. We reached out to Will and did not hear back but thanks to the rumor website Snopes, we have a pretty good idea where he got his information. In mid September, the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy posted a commentary from two University of Illinois professors. The commentary, co-written by Lisa Brosseau and Rachel Jones, argued that health care workers treating patients with Ebola should wear respirators. Face masks, they said, are not enough. We asked Brosseau if Will had correctly relayed her work. Brosseau said her views had nothing to do with Ebola spreading among the public at large. The focus was on health care workers treating people in the isolation wards. ""We were concerned about aerosols generated by infected patients in the most severe stage of the disease,"" Brosseau said. Will had mistakenly connected the pathway of infection in a hospital room with someone coughing or sneezing in public. As has been well documented, the first symptom of infection is a fever. As the virus multiplies in the body, vomiting and diarrhea set in. Brosseau had written that it is possible that for patients in that condition, tiny water particles from violent vomiting and diarrhea could get into the air and be inhaled. In a laboratory experiment, monkeys with hoods over their heads could acquire the Ebola virus, but Brosseau said that lab experiments should be put in context. ""We are not aware of any published data about the viability or infectiousness of the Ebola organism in aerosols in the real world,"" Brosseau told PunditFact. ""It appears unlikely that the public will be exposed to infectious aerosols because they are not likely to encounter infected people experiencing the severe symptoms."" We found similar views in the Oxford Journal of Infectious Diseases, and summaries issued by the Centers for Disease Control , the World Health Organization and the New England Journal of Medicine. Adam Lauring, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Michigan, emphasized that Ebola is not a respiratory disease. Coughing and sneezing are not symptoms in the way that they are with the flu. Stephen Gire, a research scientist in the Sabeti Lab at Harvard University, said if someone with Ebola sneezed or coughed into your face when you were close to them, that could transmit the virus through droplets. But, ""It’s important to note that this form of transmission does not constitute 'airborne,' "" Gire said. ""This is still a form of direct contact.""  ""If you were on a plane, and someone sneezed, you wouldn’t be at risk of getting infected unless you were sneezed on directly within close quarters, and that cough or sneeze transferred droplets into mucosal membranes. This is very unlikely scenario, but not out of the realm of possibility. I think I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve been sneezed on directly, and only one of those times was by someone I didn’t know."" One of the problems with the public debate over Ebola, Lauring said, is that science can’t prove that something will never happen. On the other hand, he also said we ought to look at what has happened. ""If airborne transmission was an imminent concern, one would have to ask why no one in the United States has been infected except for two people who had close contact with the patient,"" Lauring said. ""Importantly, none of the people who were living with the patient prior to his second trip to thee Texas hospital have been infected."" While we are not fact-checking Will’s statement about infectious particles remaining alive for several days on a dry surface, Lauring said he knows of no evidence of that. Gire said it's theoretically possible under the right conditions, though it's highly unlikely.  Our ruling Will said that some scientists say that Ebola can be transmitted in public by a sneeze or a cough. The source of that was a commentary about the risks to hospital workers treating people in advanced stages of the disease. One of the authors of that commentary said her work applied only to health care workers in those settings. The medical literature says sneezing and coughing are not part of the disease’s typical symptoms, and experts we reached drew a bright line between what might happen in a hospital isolation ward and a person with early symptoms of Ebola before he or she is admitted. There is no evidence that Ebola has been transmitted in the general public through coughing or sneezing. Will took a medical commentary out of context. We rate the claim False. Update (Noon, Oct. 20): After we published this item, we heard from some folks who disagreed with our ruling.

Jim Webb says CEOs make 350 times more than workers
","Former U.S. Sen. Jim Webb, who’s mulling a presidential run, says there’s a lack of ""economic fairness"" for working families in the United States. During a recent address to the National Press Club in Washington, Webb lamented that compensation to top corporate executives has been soaring while workers’ pay has remained flat. ""When I graduated from the Naval Academy (in 1968), the average corporate CEO made 20 times the average worker’s pay. Today that multiple is about 350,"" said Webb, a Democrat. Let’s see whether Webb’s figures on the growth in pay disparity are correct. 1968 pay Amy Hogan, Webb’s daughter and occasional spokesperson, sent us an email providing with some sourcing for her father’s claim. But it didn’t explain how Webb came up with the CEO-to-worker pay ratio for 1968. Our search failed to turn up data for 1968, but we found a couple sources that listed ratios from around that year. In 1965, according to the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, the average CEO made about 20 times a typical worker’s pay. Average earnings for a CEO were $126,000, while workers made $5,947. Adjusted to today’s dollars, the executive made $819,000 and the worker made $39,500. In 1970 the ratio was 30-to-1, according to research by Kevin Murphy, a professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California. The top executives averaged $196,310 in earnings, while workers made $6,540. Adjusted to today, the CEO made about $1.2 million and the worker was paid $40,100. Current pay Hogan told us Webb’s 350-to-one claim was based on an article in The Wall Street Journal last year that cited statistics on executive pay compiled by the AFL-CIO. The labor union found that in 2012, the average CEO made 354 times more than the average worker. The AFL-CIO has updated statistics for 2013. Based on data from 350 corporations listed in Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the union said CEOs received total annual compensation averaging $11.7 million. Average pay for production and nonsupervisory workers was $35,239. By this measure, CEOs made 331 times more than the average worker. The AFL-CIO does not have the final word on this subject, however. Its finding is on the high side of a number of estimates published by different organizations on CEO-to-worker pay ratios. There’s no standard formula for computing the figure and the results vary based on which corporations -- and how many of them -- are used in a study. The definitions of CEO compensation differ. For example, some researchers count the value of all stock options made available to a CEO during a year, while others only count the value of options the executive cashed. Similarly, researchers use different definitions to define workers and compute their compensation. In general, workers are considered to be non-supervisory personnel. Because corporations aren’t required to reveal compensation figures for their entire staff, researchers cull figures for worker pay from broad, national data. The Economic Policy Institute concluded the pay ratio for last year was 296-to-1. It said average CEO compensation at 350 large corporations was $15.2 million and pegged workers’ average pay at $55,800. Here are two other CEO-to-worker pay ratios we came across: Bloomberg: 204-to-1 in 2011 and 2012 University of Southern California: 307-to-1 or 420-to-1, depending on how stock options are counted. While the studies produce different numbers, they all point to eye-popping differences in earnings between CEOs and workers. Researchers say CEO compensation has soared in recent decades largely because generous stock options have been weaved into their pay packages. Webb says income disparity should be eased by overhauling the tax code. He favors eliminating income tax breaks that favor the wealthy and raising levies on capital gains and dividends. Several executive pay experts told us Webb’s figures were credible based on research they had seen. But they cautioned against reading too much into CEO-to-worker ratios saying they don’t really shed much light on what type of compensation CEOs should ultimately receive. ""I think it’s dangerous to kind of collapse the whole debate into that ratio,"" said David Larcker, a professor of accounting and corporate governance at Stanford University. ""You want to focus on things like how much value are people (CEOs) creating and what share of that value should they get and what would be equitable across society, and those are very, very hard questions to answer."" We should finally note that better data on CEO-to-worker pay ratios may soon be available. The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform bill requires publicly traded companies to disclose their ratios quarterly. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is developing guidelines on how the figures should be computed. Our ruling Webb said that in 1968 the average CEO earned 20 times more than a typical worker, and today, the ratio is about 350 to 1. His numbers describing today’s ratio, while credible, are on the high side of research. Webb relies on a study by the AFL-CIO. EPI puts the figure at 300-to-1. Last year, Bloomberg pegged the ratio at 204-to-1. The University of Southern California put the ratio at 307-to-1 or 420-to-1, depending on how stock options are defined.   There’s no doubt about Webb’s main point: the gap between CEOs and workers has seismically expanded over the last half century. But there’s room to quibble over the numbers he uses. So we rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/19/jim-webb/jim-webb-says-ceos-make-350-times-more-workers/

David Dewhurst says prayer rugs found in Texas brush near Mexico border
","The lieutenant governor of Texas has twice declared the discovery of ""prayer rugs"" on the Texas side of the border with Mexico, also suggesting members of the Islamic State group have possibly snuck in. At the September 2014, Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C., David Dewhurst described suspicions of an impending invasion of terrorists crossing the Rio Grande. As a sign, he said, ""prayer rugs have recently been found on the Texas side of the border in the brush,"" according to CSPAN2 video posted online by the liberal news site Talking Points Memo.  Of late, some Texas-Mexico border claims have lacked factual footing. In September 2014, PolitiFact rated Mostly False a claim the Islamic State group was operating in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico. PolitiFact Texas subsequently rated Pants on Fire a California congressman’s statement that at least 10 ISIS fighters had been caught by the U.S. Border Patrol. So Dewhurst, who about a week earlier made a similar claim about prayer rugs in a border security panel discussion at the Texas Tribune Festival, made us wonder. For starters, scholars and Muslim religious figures we reached for this story warned against linking Muslim prayer to a person’s interest in terrorism. In themselves, experts said, the rugs -- like the ones pictured below in a photo emailed to us by Anees Siddiqui of Austin -- represent cleanliness; they’re placed on the ground where a Muslim believer prays. Also, the experts said, the rugs are not used by all the world’s estimated 1.6 billion Muslims.  Courtesy photo: Anees Siddiqui, spokesman, the Islamic Center of Greater Austin. Dewhurst’s basis To our inquiry, Andrew Barlow, a state spokesman for Dewhurst, who lost his re-election bid this spring, emailed us two URLs and said, ""Lt. Governor Dewhurst based his statement on this report: ...and this article."" The latest provided account was a Sept. 11, 2014, online news report by KTRH, 740 AM in Houston, quoting Ed Turzanski, a former U.S. intelligence officer and professor of political science and government at La Salle University in Philadelphia, saying: ""We've seen Muslim prayer rugs and other items that have been left behind by people entering the country illegally."" By phone, Turzanski told us Border Patrol agents, in numerous private conversations over the past decade, told him prayer rugs were found at the border, but it’s been ""a number of years"" since the last report. He also offered to try to put knowledgeable sources in touch with us; we heard no more. Otherwise, he warned, government agencies would not admit prayer rug discoveries to the press. He said officials in President Barack Obama’s administration forbid the Border Patrol from speaking about anything that ""goes against the administration’s border security narrative."" The other news story Barlow noted, posted June 30, 2014, on Breitbart.com, a conservative news and commentary website, quoted an unidentified ""source who works among independent American security contractors along the southern border in Arizona and Texas"" saying six Middle Easterners had been picked up in Laredo, Texas, ""right along (the area) with the ranchers in Texas finding prayer rugs in their ranches."" After we tried to contact the Breitbart reporter, Kerry Picket, Kurt Bardella, president of Endeavor Strategic Communications, the firm that runs public relations for Breitbart, said by phone Breitbart could not reveal the source who described the prayer rug discoveries. He also said the organization could not tell us what group the source belongs to, where the source lives or why the source believed the ranchers’ findings were prayer rugs. Bardella said: ""The source stands by his statement."" Other accounts and authorities Via the Nexis news database, we spotted news reports of prayer rugs found along the border as long ago as 2005. None of the reports presented on-the-record sourced-by-name evidence. Separately, federal and local law enforcement authorities denied receiving reports of found prayer rugs while Tom Vinger, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, emailed us that the agency doesn’t track that information. By phone, Joe Gutierrez Jr., spokesman for the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley Sector, said he had heard ""nothing"" about prayer rug finds. Gutierrez said he passed our query on to all Texas Border Patrol sectors by email. A response came from Rod Kise, a public information officer at the Rio Grande Valley Sector headquarters in Edinburg. Kise emailed: ""Regarding the discovery of prayer rugs along the Texas-Mexico Border, we had no reports of prayer rugs being found."" Kise also said: ""It is not unusual to find trash/etc. along smuggling routes."" By email, Nick Georgiou, managing editor of the Laredo Morning Times, said the newspaper ""is not aware of any reports of Muslim prayer rugs found near the Texas-Mexico border around Laredo."" To our inquiry, Brenda Medina-Moreno, a Laredo spokeswoman for the Webb County sheriff’s office, said by email: ""The Webb County Sheriff’s Office has not come across any prayer rugs and/or reports of the rugs along our border crossings."" Experts: Photograph not a prayer rug Amid unnamed-source reports of prayer rug findings, we found only one article presenting a photo of an alleged prayer rug found on the border in Arizona. The July 9, 2014, news story was written for Breitbart.com by Picket, who also wrote the story on prayer rugs found by ranchers near Laredo, Texas that Dewhurst relied on. By email, Breitbart spokesman Bardella pointed out an editor’s note attached to the end of the July 2014 story. The note said: ""We reasonably relied on the statements and picture provided by a third-party source regarding the finding of an apparent prayer shawl at the border.  There are now conflicting reports about those statements; however, the third party source still fully stands behind the accuracy of his original account."" To get our own sense of the photo’s accuracy, we sent a copy of the photograph and a request for analysis to over a dozen U.S. religious figures and scholars. We received  eight replies, with all the respondents saying the pictured item did not look like a prayer rug. Frank Griffel, chairman of the Council of Middle East Studies at Yale University, said: ""Is this a joke? What makes people think that the vague cloth at the border is a prayer rug? I can't see any connection. It's an old piece of cloth and it has no resemblance to a rug, even less so to a prayer rug."" Samer Ali, associate professor of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Texas, said it didn’t look like a prayer rug because it was too thin, had seams, had hems and didn’t look like any design he’d seen on a prayer rug. Mustafa Umar, director of education and outreach at the Islamic Institute of Orange County in California, said: ""The checkered pattern is not characteristic of a prayer rug and was in fact discouraged by the Prophet Muhammad to use because that pattern distracts the Muslim from prayer."" Our ruling Dewhurst said ""prayer rugs have recently been found"" in brush on the Texas side of the U.S.-Mexico border. This claim is weakened because it’s not backed up by sourced-by-name witnesses nor did any authority confirm such a find when we inquired. If prayer rugs were showing up to someone’s alarm, we think there'd be legitimate photographs and the rugs themselves available for inspection. Another hole: While people of the Muslim faith surely cross the Mexico-Texas border – that’s not at issue in this fact check – it’s unreasonable to presume the presence of prayer rugs means individuals carrying them intend to commit violent acts on U.S.soil, an implication of Dewhurst’s declaration. In the end, we find his statement incorrect and ridiculous. Rugs (we mean Pants) on Fire!",/factchecks/2014/oct/19/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-prayer-rugs-found-texas-brush-/

Providence firefighters’ union says Elorza wants to teach public school children God does not exist
","""Extremist."" That’s one of the ways the Providence firefighters union describes Democratic mayoral candidate Jorge Elorza in a recent mailing to city residents. The mailer was sent out in early October 2014, by Local 799 of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which has endorsed Elorza’s opponent, Vincent A. ""Buddy"" Cianci Jr., in the race for mayor. It listed three reasons to vote against Elorza. The first? He lacks experience. The second? Elorza, the firefighters say, supports a municipal income tax. PolitiFact Rhode Island examined this claim when it was made by Cianci last month and ruled it False. The third? ""Elorza wants to teach our public school children about the ‘non-existence of God,’"" the piece said. The basis for the claim is cited in the mailer: an article that Elorza, a law professor  and former Housing Court judge, had published in the University of Pittsburgh Law Review in 2010. The 54-page article, ""Secularism and the Constitution: Can Government Be Too Secular?,"" sets out to answer a question. ""If scientific evidence leads us to conclude that a particular aspect of God cannot be true, can this be taught in the public schools?"" wrote Elorza, who is on a leave of absence from Roger Williams University School of Law, where he teaches constitutional law and other subjects. The article defines four views of God: the atheist view in which God does not exist; the deist view, which holds that God created the universe but has no influence on daily events; the theist view, which holds that God is not only the creator but also an intervenor in the world’s affairs; and what Elorza calls the ""memist"" view in which God lays down a moral code but ""resides entirely in the minds of its adherents."" Elorza focuses on the theist view, arguing that it violates the laws of physics. Science, he says, proves that the theist God does not exist. And U.S. courts have generally ruled that something can be taught in the public schools that may contradict a religious belief if science supports it. Evolution is one example that Elorza gives. As for the three other views of God, Elorza makes it clear that their existence cannot be proven one way or another. Thus, no argument can be made to support teaching that they do not exist, and doing so would violate the Constitution, according to Elorza. So what is his answer to the question that he posed at the beginning of the article? ""I conclude, first, that teaching that the theist God does not exist would not violate any of the underlying values and second, that the consequences of doing so are not as far-reaching as may be initially believed,"" Elorza wrote. Elorza may have concluded, in his lengthy academic paper, that it is legally defensible to teach the non-existence of one particular aspect of God, but nowhere in the article does he say that he wants schools to teach it. Much has been written by others on local blogs on this subject (see here and here), but we couldn’t find any public statements made by Elorza advocating for schools to adopt the position. In fact, he said just the opposite during a WPRI-12 debate in August, when asked by reporter Ted Nesi about the law review article. ""I don’t seek to have this be taught in the public schools,"" Elorza said. ""This is a hypothetical that I laid out over 60 pages in an academic article."" ""And it’s not something that you would seek to implement in the Providence schools?"" Nesi asked. ""Absolutely not,"" Elorza replied. (See the exchange here, starting at 28:40.) Derek Silva, secretary of the firefighters’ union, told us that Elorza is now trying to distance himself from the article. When we contacted Elorza’s campaign, his spokesman, David Ortiz, defended the candidate. ""Jorge was raised Christian,"" Ortiz said in an email. ""He believes in God. He does not want to teach atheism in schools, and has never made that suggestion anywhere."" Our ruling The Providence firefighters union says that Jorge Elorza is an extremist who wants public schools to teach that God does not exist. But their only evidence is a misreading of a 2010 academic article Elorza wrote. Nowhere in the 54-page article does Elorza say he wants public schools to teach that there is no God. Elorza has said repeatedly that’s not his view and we could find no public statements by him that suggest otherwise. This is an inflammatory claim that has no basis in fact. It’s a good thing the firefighters union has experience dealing with flames, because we rule this claim Pants on Fire.

Has Atty. Gen. Peter Kilmartin prosecuted more public records lawsuits than his two predecessors?
","Rhode Island has long been a battleground in the fight for open government. Public bodies vote in secret. Deals are cut behind closed doors. Police departments withhold arrest records and daily logs. A report issued last month by ACCESS/RI found a ""troubling level of non-compliance"" with the state's open records law and called for enhanced oversight by the Attorney General's office. During an interview with Rhode Island Public Radio that aired on Oct. 2, 2014, incumbent Atty. Gen. Peter Kilmartin, a Democrat, was asked about enforcement of the open records law. He lamented that some public bodies are not following the law despite repeated attempts to educate government officials about the documents that are supposed to be public. ""Unfortunately, in the past three years, we have prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined,"" he said. ""That tells me there is still a problem."" It's a statement he repeated on Oct. 10, 2014, during a taping of a debate on WPRI-TV with Republic Dawson Hodgson. We were interested in whether Kilmartin has brought more open records cases to court than his two predecessors, Patrick Lynch (now a lawyer in private practice) and Sheldon Whitehouse (now a U.S. Senator). When we asked Kilmartin's office for a tally of the cases, spokeswoman Amy Kempe sent us a list of 18 civil lawsuits dating as far back as 2002. ""There were no lawsuits from 1999 to 2002,"" she said in an email. According to the list, Whitehouse took one case to court, suing the Anthony fire district in 2002. During Lynch's eight years in office he filed seven suits -- against public entities in Johnston, North Kingstown, Cranston, Woonsocket and Lincoln. Barrington was sued twice. Since 2011, according to the list, Kilmartin has filed 10 suits against public entities for violating the open records law, starting with the Albion Fire District in Lincoln (which Lynch also sued) and ending most recently with the town of Warren. We spot-checked Kilmartin's cases using our archives. To check the list of his predecessors, we first contacted the offices of Lynch and Whitehouse to ask if Kilmartin was omitting any cases. Whitehouse's office said the number seems correct. Repeated inquiries to Lynch's law office produced no response. So we turned to court records and received a list of all civil suits brought by Whitehouse and Lynch against public bodies. Once again, Kilmartin's tally checked out. In summary, Peter Kilmartin said that in the past three years, his office has ""prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined."" His office has filed 10 suits since 2011. Lynch had seven during his eight years as Attorney General. Whitehouse had just one during his four years in that office. We can't say if the trend is due to previous attorneys general being less aggressive in prosecuting violations of the state's open government laws than Kilmartin, or if public bodies are getting more brazen in ignoring them. Certainly the latest ACCESS/RI report offers evidence that the phrase ""open government"" is -- for some of Rhode Island's ""public"" bodies -- an oxymoron.    Rhode Island's culture of secrecy persists, but Kilmartin has filed more lawsuits than his two predecessors conbined so we rate Kilmartin's claim as True.

Leticia Van de Putte says Dan Patrick voted against testing rape kits, letting rapists roam
","In a video ad, Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Leticia Van de Putte presents Republican nominee Dan Patrick as too extreme on vital public safety issues. The ad’s narrator initially says Patrick, a Houston senator, ""would deny victims of rape any options at all,"" a claim rooted in Patrick’s statement in a January 2014 debate that he would permit an abortion only to save the life of an endangered mother. ""And,"" the narrator says, ""he voted against funding to test the backlog of rape kits. Allowing rapists to walk free."" Patrick, the narrator says, ""is just too dangerous."" Did Patrick vote against testing backlogged rape kits, letting rapists walk? Van de Putte cites Patrick vote against 2014-15 state budget Manny Garcia, a spokesman for Van de Putte, a San Antonio state senator, told us by email the basis of her rape-kit claim was Patrick’s vote against the final version of the overall 2014-15 state budget that cleared the Senate in May 2013. A backup document Garcia sent over noted a June 6, 2013, Texas Tribune news story stating that the budget allotted $11 million to the Texas Department of Public Safety ""to help address the state’s massive backlog of untested rape kits. ""In 2011,"" the story said, ""the Legislature passed Senate Bill 1636, by state Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, which requires that state law enforcement agencies report the number of untested rape kits and submit a certain number to DPS for testing."" The story said the new funding would  ""cover the outsourcing costs to have the kits tested, and DPS estimates that based on historical data, about half of the untested kits will yield traces of DNA."" According to legislative records, Davis in May 2011 won unanimous Senate approval of her proposal when it was sent to the House and again in the body’s concurrence with House amendments--meaning Patrick voted ""aye"" twice as well. We asked the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault about the impact of the funding. A staff attorney, Chris Kaiser, said by email the tests are just starting to happen, but it’s ""reasonable to assume that out of all those kits there will be some investigations and prosecutions resulting from DNA hits. However, we’re talking about fairly long-term effects of the 82nd Legislature’s funding, not immediate analysis that is helping to scoop offenders off the streets today."" Patrick’s actions in 2013 session Next, we focused on Patrick’s actions. As noted in a previous fact check, Patrick was among four senators who voted against the final version of the 2014-15 state budget. In a May 30, 2013, public interview with the Texas Tribune’s Evan Smith, Patrick said he voted ""no"" -- after backing earlier versions -- because education initiatives, including funds to pay for students to take the SAT, weren’t in it. He did not mention the budgeted money to test the kits. Legislative records show Patrick supporting, and even having a hand in launching, the spending to test the kits. Patrick serves on the Senate Finance Committee, which on March 13, 2013, unanimously voted in favor of the panel’s version of Senate Bill 1, the budget act, including the money for testing the kits. To our inquiry about Patrick’s position on the rape-kit expenditure in the 2013 session, Torie Camp, an Austin consultant who was then a TAASA official, emailed us what she described as a March 13, 2013, Senate Finance Committee document indicating Patrick was among a subset of senators to initially put the kit funding into the budget. The document, including the typed notation ""tentative work group decisions,"" indicates several committee members, including Patrick, were tasked as a ""work group"" with resolving the finance panel’s public safety new spending items. And, the document indicates, those senators by that date had agreed to pencil in $10.95 million in state revenue to pay for outsourcing DNA screening and testing services for approximately 10,000 sexual assault kits a year. (The document is also posted online by the Legislative Budget Board which has also posted a similar document indicating the commitment of money to the kits was an unsettled issue for senators as of Feb. 12, 2013.) On March 20, 2013, Patrick was among 28 senators who voted to advance the budget (including the kit-test funding) to the House, according to the Senate Journal entry for that day. Two senators (though not Patrick) voted ""no."" Generally in the 2013 session, Camp said by phone, ""we never got a sense that anybody was opposed to this money in there. This wasn’t something anybody wanted to oppose."" Rapists walking free? Camp said that after the budget took effect in September 2013, DPS proceeded to bid out the tests of the kits to private laboratories which, Camp said, started working through kits in fall 2014. Camp said it makes sense that some of the resulting DNA ""hits,"" to be passed along by DPS to local police departments, will lead to individuals being convicted of assaults -- and be taken off the streets. For now,"" she said, ""we’re just not far enough into the process to know we’re going to take sexual offenders off the streets. But my guess is we will."" By email, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said that effective June 2014, the agency had an agreement for the University of North Texas Health Science Center to test about 1,000 kits. Also, Vinger said, the department has contracted with companies in Dallas and Virginia to test the kits. ""In the coming months, we will ultimately direct agencies where to send their kits,"" he said. ""The actual testing is expected to take place over two years."" Vinger said DPS doesn’t track successful prosecutions related to sexual assault testing  — whether via kits or other evidence.    Vinger also said ""backlog"" is misleading in reference to the kits now being tested since most of them hadn’t previously been submitted to a crime lab for testing, based on decisions by local law enforcement agencies and prosecutors, he said. In August 2013, according to a New York Times/Texas Tribune news story published at the time, DPS estimated there were close to 20,000 untested kits statewide per information from various law enforcement agencies. The story said the untested kits had collected in police evidence rooms amid tight budgets, overworked crime labs and, in some cases, determinations by authorities that there was insufficient cause to test a kit. By email, we pointed out to Van de Putte that Patrick evidently played a role in initially putting the money for testing the kits into the budget and there is no indication his vote against the full final budget allowed rapists to walk. Garcia, stressing Patrick’s opposition to the final budget, emailed: ""If it was up to him alone, the budget would not have passed at that point in time, Meaning that testing for the rape kits would not be funded."" Our ruling Van de Putte said Patrick voted ""against funding to test the backlog of rape kits, allowing rapists to walk free."" This claim is flawed in various ways -- starting with blaming Patrick for a result that didn’t come to be. In reality, Patrick appears to have been among senators to initially put the kit-test funding into the state budget. And while he voted against the final overall budget, there’s no indication he did so to stop the kits from being tested. Also, the contention that rapists walked free as a result of Patrick’s action is incorrect. The funding (to repeat) passed into law.

"['Economy', 'Workers', 'Wisconsin', 'Mary Burke']","
Mary Burke says Walker at fault for nearly $3,000 drop in incomes
","Democrat Mary Burke wasted no time in her first debate with Gov. Scott Walker, rolling out a blistering economic critique in her opening statement. Beyond the expected reference to Walker’s failure to spur creation of 250,000 jobs as he promised, Burke unveiled a new talking point. ""His approach isn’t working,"" she said Oct. 10, 2014. ""The typical Wisconsin family has actually seen their real income drop by nearly $3,000 in the last four years. $3,000!"" Not so fast, the Republican Party of Wisconsin countered, quickly issuing a news release with this headline: ""Mary Burke Opens Her Disastrous Debate Appearance With A New Lie."" Let’s go to the Truth-O-Meter. When asked for backup, the Burke campaign cited income figures reported by the Wisconsin Council on Children & Families following the Sept. 17, 2014 release of data through the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. The American Community Survey is the preferred method for tracking year-to-year changes in median household income at the state level. It is based on a random sampling of residents from every state. The income figures are adjusted for inflation, allowing apples-to-apples comparisons over time. Burke called it ""real"" income, the technical term for the inflation-adjusted approach. The most recent survey year reported 2013 income. So to track the four-year trend, as Burke did, you have to start with 2009 as a baseline and measure changes across 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Burke’s camp did just that -- but there’s a problem with the method, as we shall see in a moment. Here’s what the survey reported: Year Median household income Dollar change Percent change 2009 $54,210 2010 $52,317 -$1,893 -3.5% 2011 $52,111 -$206 -0.4% 2012 $51,649 -$462 -0.9% 2013 $51,467 -$182 -0.3% 2009-’13 -$2,743 -5.1%   That $2,743 drop was big enough drop to be statistically significant, even when considering the survey’s margin of error, census officials told us. And Burke describes it as ""nearly $3,000"" -- a characterization generally on target, though that $257 difference is not insubstantial. There’s trouble here, though, for Burke. She associates Walker, and Walker alone, with the four-year period she discusses. That sounds reasonable on the surface; the governor’s term is four years, and it’s ending. But there’s no 2014 data yet, so to get four full years Burke has to dip back into the final year (2010) of Walker’s Democratic predecessor, Gov. Jim Doyle. In other words, the census data she cites covers one year from the Doyle era and three years of Walker’s time. Indeed, most of the income drop Burke cites was in 2010, Doyle’s final year, when the median household income fell $1,893 or 3.5 percent. The drop under Walker, in his first three years, amounts to $850, or 1.6 percent. The blame game on economic matters is tricky under the best circumstances. The lingering effects of the national recession, Walker’s cuts to public workers’ disposable income, his tax cuts, the below-average pace of job creation, the national economy -- all those factors and more play into fluctuations in income. But in this instance Burke blames Walker for something that largely occurred before his watch, providing a distorted view for voters. Our rating Saying that his approach hasn’t worked, Burke blamed Walker for income losses, saying, ""the typical Wisconsin family has actually seen their real income drop by nearly $3,000 in the last four years."" While median household income in Wisconsin has fallen $2,743 in four years, most of the drop occurred before Walker took office in 2011, We rate the claim Mostly False.

Plenty of jobs for people in Wisconsin who want to work, Scott Walker says
","Gov. Scott Walker broke his promise to create 250,000 jobs, but as he seeks re-election, he argues there are plenty of jobs for people in Wisconsin who are willing to work. ""We don’t hear about this often enough, but we have a website called JobCenterOfWisconsin.com,"" Walker said at a campaign stop near Milwaukee on Sept. 20, 2014. ""You know how many jobs were listed on that website last week?"" the governor asked. ""More than 70,000 jobs."" There were gasps from the audience. ""Jobs are not the problem,"" Walker continued. ""Connecting people to those jobs with the skills they need and, more importantly, getting people off of the couch and off the dependence who are able and into those jobs, making it more effective, a bigger incentive for them to get back to work is really the difference."" Walker has since repeated the claim, including during his first debate with Democratic challenger Mary Burke on Oct. 10, 2014. Do his numbers add up? The website JobCenterOfWisconsin.com is run by the state Department of Workforce Development, whose secretary is appointed by Walker. The department describes the site as a no-cost employment exchange that links employers and job seekers. Its popularity appears to have grown dramatically in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 4, 2014 election. The home page shows a running tally of the number of job openings listed on the site. In releasing a jobs plan on Sept. 16, 2014, Walker said there were more than 60,000 job openings on the site. By the morning of Oct. 17, the running tally on the site’s home page was just under 80,000. That’s an increase of roughly one-third in a month. Moreover, a plus-sign (+) next to the running tally indicates that even more jobs are available. The database We asked the Department of Workforce Development to provide us a spreadsheet showing all of the job openings on the website. We received it Oct. 9, 2014. There were more than 79,000 job listings on the main part of the spreadsheet, including about 74,000 that had been posted within the past six months. Those are the ones that power the running tally on the website’s home page. There were more than 65,000 listings on the second part of the spreadsheet. More on those in a minute. Those figures obviously are well above the more than 70,000 that Walker claimed. But whether there were that many jobs actually available is less clear: 1. The state itself doesn’t vouch for the accuracy of all the listings. Of the 79,000 primary listings on the site, about 41,000 are reviewed by state employees and are set to automatically expire after 90 days, the workforce development department told us. The other 38,000 primary listings come from two national ""partners"" and the department relies on those firms to update their listings. Regarding the other 65,000 listings -- which are not specifically counted on the home page of the website -- the state told us it advises job seekers to beware when searching those listings that they come from multiple sources and can include duplicates. Those sources include Career Builder and Craigslist. 2. Thousands of jobs are outside of Wisconsin. Walker made his claim in the context of jobs in Wisconsin, even if he didn’t specifically say that all 70,000 job openings were within the state’s borders. According to One Wisconsin Now, a liberal advocacy group, about 13,000 of the job listings were for openings not in Wisconsin but in neighboring states, a figure the Department of Workforce Development did not dispute. Our own check found, for example, roughly 1,100 listings in Dubuque, Iowa, and roughly 950 each in Rockford, Ill., and Duluth, Minn. Finally, although Walker’s claim didn’t address the quality of jobs listed on the website, it’s worth noting that many are on the low end of the pay scale. Among the most common job titles advertised were cashier, certified nursing assistant, registered nurse and restaurant crew. Two of the three employers with the most job listings were McDonald’s and the Kwik Trip convenience store chain. Our rating Walker said ""more than 70,000"" job openings are listed on a state jobs website, JobCenterofWisconsin.com. The raw number of job listings exceeds that figure. But not all of the listings are verified by the state and thousands of the jobs are outside of Wisconsin. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.  To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.",/factchecks/2014/oct/17/scott-walker/plenty-jobs-people-wisconsin-who-want-work-scott-w/
"['Abortion', 'Rhode Island', 'Health Care', 'Women', 'The Rhode Island Catholic']","
Catholic paper says R.I. health exchange one of few in U.S. without plan excluding abortion coverage
","Abortion was pushed to the forefront of the race for the governor’s office after Democrat Gina Raimondo was endorsed by Planned Parenthood’s political action committee. In a short speech at a Sept. 25 news conference, Raimondo argued that women should be able to make health decisions without interference from their employers or the government. The next day, The Providence Journal reported that, in an interview after the news conference, Raimondo said she would oppose efforts to offer an insurance plan on the Rhode Island health exchange that would exclude coverage for abortion or contraception. (Raimondo’s campaign later issued a statement expressing a different position. More on that later.) Opponents seized on Raimondo’s position, saying that she had staked out an ""extreme"" position on abortion. Thomas Tobin, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, was one of the first and most vocal critics. The Rhode Island Catholic, the diocese’s newspaper, followed up in an Oct. 2 editorial. ""[Gina Raimondo] demonstrates an inexplicable disregard for the sincere conscience of thousands of Rhode Islanders who don’t want to participate in insurance programs that pay for abortion,"" the editorial said. ""Almost every other state has provided that option."" We wondered if nearly every state really has provided that option. Rick Snizek, editor of The Rhode Island Catholic, told us that the source of the claim was a recent report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The Sept. 15 report was done at the request of Republican leaders in the House of Representatives. It looked at all the health exchanges in the nation that were created under the Affordable Care Act and what coverage options for abortion were provided in each state. Under the law, exchanges are required to offer insurance covering abortions when ""the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest, or the life of the pregnant woman would be endangered unless an abortion is performed."" The Affordable Care Act does not require states to offer abortion coverage beyond that. In fact, the GAO report found that 17 states have passed laws that explicitly forbid health plans from offering expanded coverage, while another 6 severely restrict coverage. The GAO contacted the 28 remaining states and found that in 8 states, no expanded coverage is offered; in 15 states, at least one plan offers such coverage; and in 5 states, all plans offer full coverage. Rhode Island is in that final group, along with Connecticut, Hawaii, New Jersey and Vermont. In those five states, there is no option for consumers who want a health plan that does not cover non-excepted abortions. In other words, The Rhode Island Catholic editorial was accurate. The Affordable Care Act recognizes this issue and requires all states to provide an insurance option by 2017 that does not cover abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or where the mother’s life is endangered. Questions about abortion coverage were raised before the Rhode Island health exchange was set up. Governor Chafee created the exchange through an executive order in 2011, after an effort to do so through legislation stalled in the General Assembly over abortion language. As recently as last year, the state Senate passed a bill that would have required some plans to allow people who sign up for them to ""opt out"" of abortion services. But the bill failed to clear the House and HealthSource RI was set up without any state restrictions or provisions regarding abortion. Now back to Raimondo’s position on insurance coverage for abortions. If the federal government will eventually require all health insurance exchanges, including Rhode Island’s, to offer at least one plan that doesn’t cover most abortions, how could Raimondo oppose it? When we posed that question to the Raimondo campaign, Nicole Kayner offered this statement: ""Gina is not opposed to HealthSource RI including an insurance plan that excludes reproductive services. In fact, the Affordable Care Act requires that by 2017, the exchange must do that. Individuals should be able to go to HealthSource RI and buy a plan that makes the most sense for them."" Our ruling The Rhode Island Catholic newspaper said that Rhode Island is one of the few states that does not offer an insurance option that excludes most abortion coverage. According to a federal report, only Rhode Island and four other states fall into that category. We rule the statement True.

"['Ebola', 'Public Health', 'PunditFact', 'Glenn Beck']","
Glenn Beck warns of massive mutations in Ebola virus
","The prospect of wholesale economic and social collapse exerts a peculiar magnetism on some people. The fight against the Ebola virus is custom-made for such speculations and conservative radio host Glenn Beck raised them in full during the Oct. 15 broadcast of his radio show. Beck envisioned fearful Americans avoiding trips to the mall, leading to a downward spiral in consumer spending. Although to date, the virus has only been known to be transmitted by contact with the bodily fluids of one infected person, Beck said that would change. ""Think of this America, please think of this,"" Beck said. ""Every time somebody new gets the Ebola virus, it mutates. It's going to go aerosol."" To go ""aerosol"" would mean water droplets from a sneeze or a cough could transmit the disease. There is no recorded case of this occurring with Ebola; one study positively asserts that the virus does not spread this way. Still, Beck argued that the 8,000 victims of Ebola in West Africa represent 8,000 ""different combinations"" of Ebola. Around PunditFact, we say there’s no way to check a prediction, but what we can do is dig deeper into Beck’s claim that the Ebola virus mutates with each new person it infects. We contacted Beck’s producers and they added some nuance that Beck left out. ""Many of those mutations mean nothing, but some of them might be able to change the way the virus behaves inside the human body,"" the producers said in an email. According to two top infectious disease researchers, Beck is correct that the virus mutates, but left out what his producers later noted -- namely that not every mutation does anything to make Ebola more deadly or more difficult to treat. The explanation why can get technical, but you can break down what happens as a series of steps that reduce the impact of these genetic changes. By the way, both researchers also said that the virus doesn’t need a new victim to mutate. It mutates inside its host, even if it is never passed on. Most mutations hurt the virus You need to understand a basic fact about Ebola. As of now, there is no ""cure,"" as in there are no drugs that kill Ebola. Doctors treat the symptoms of Ebola while the body fights the virus. In that respect, it’s like the flu. Adam Lauring is an assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School. Lauring explained that because Ebola is an RNA virus, each time it replicates in a person’s body, there’s a good chance that small changes will take place. But Lauring emphasized that most changes do not strengthen the virus or make it more resistant to human defenses. In fact, the typical mutation has the opposite effect. ""The available data consistently show that most newly generated mutations in RNA viruses reduce fitness,"" Lauring said. ""That is, most mutations are made and then lost from the population. They do not take hold."" Put simply, the virus might mutate but it doesn’t really matter. Lauring said we should keep in mind that the Ebola virus largely works through the proteins it produces. The virus’ genes make the proteins and then the proteins help the virus infect more parts of the body. Lauring’s point is that with most mutations, the genes produce a protein that doesn’t do what the virus needs and that copy of the virus dies. Most mutations don’t change anything With the virus replicating itself billions of times in a single victim, some genetic drift will take hold. But in this group, there are two basic types: synonymous and non-synonymous. The difference is in how they affect proteins. ""Synonymous mutations don’t change the protein sequence,"" Lauring said. Remember, the proteins determine how the virus works. If the proteins remain the same, so does the virus, for all practical purposes. (This is cellular biology so things are more complicated.) Since non-synonymous mutations change proteins, we’d want to know how often they happen in Ebola. Fortunately, a large team of researchers published a paper that goes directly to that point. Stephen Gire, a researcher at the Sabeti Lab at Harvard University, was one of the authors. Gire and his colleagues recently took samples from 78 patients in Sierra Leone over a three-week period. When they drilled down into the virus’ genome, they found 40 mutations that had taken place in ""protein coding regions."" About a third were non-synonymous. Put another way, 14 were able to change the proteins in the virus. The other 26 left the virus functionally as it had been before. Of that group of 14, eight occurred in regions that Gire called functionally interesting. But Gire emphasized, ""that doesn’t necessarily mean that these mutations changed or helped the virus."" Without more research, Gire said it’s impossible to know if these mutations actually made the virus more successful as an organism, and more able to move from one person to the next. Mutations might not be passed on Gire and his colleagues found that even those mutations that propagated in a victim’s bloodstream might go nowhere. ""We have many instances where we see a mutation pop up, but then there are no transmissions from that patient and so that mutation potentially dies off,"" Gire said. This gets back to the central topic in Beck’s statement. It isn’t a question of whether the virus mutates, but whether it adapts to new environments and spreads out in a new form. ""Mutation is not evolution,"" said Lauring. A solemn reminder This isn’t to say Ebola is not a serious threat. Gire and his co-authors wrote that ""continued progression of this epidemic could afford an opportunity for viral adaptation, underscoring the need for rapid containment."" At the very end of the article, there is this dedication: ""Tragically, five co-authors, who contributed greatly to public health and research efforts in Sierra Leone, contracted EVD (Ebola) and lost their battle with the disease before this manuscript could be published: Mohamed Fullah, Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Alice Kovoma, and S. Humarr Khan. We wish to honor their memory."" Our ruling Beck warned that every time someone new gets the Ebola virus, it mutates. First, mutation and replication go hand in hand and infecting a new person doesn’t change that. But the much larger point is that Beck is painting mutations with a broad brush. Most of them hurt the virus and are automatic dead-ends. Of those that don’t actually hurt it, about two-thirds don’t change how Ebola functions. Of those that change how the virus functions, there’s no data to say whether the functional changes matter. However, the most recent study in West Africa found that many new varieties are not passed on to new victims. Beck’s statement about Ebola mutations is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Accordingly, we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/16/glenn-beck/beck-warns-massive-mutations-ebola-virus/

Larry Pressler was a Republican in the Senate for 18 years before losing to Democrat Tim Johnson in 1996. Now, as Johnson retires, Pressler’s back running as an independent, undercutting what was supposed to be a cakewalk for Republican Mike Rounds and giving hope to Democrat Rick Weiland. At a recent candidate forum, Pressler made the case for his campaign. He said South Dakotans don’t have to look far to see the value of an independent in Washington. ""All four on Mount Rushmore, they were all independents at one critical point in their career,"" Pressler claimed. (Hat tip to Bloomberg Politics reporter Dave Weigel for first tweeting the quote.) At PolitiFact, we often catch politicians misattributing quotes and facts to the founding fathers and other iconic presidents. Is this one of those cases, or were the four men on Mount Rushmore — George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt — each independents at one point in their careers? An independent, in political speak, is a candidate that is not affiliated with a party, just like how Pressler is running. As you’ll see, once again, presidential history tops presidential lore. George Washington Our nation’s first president was elected unanimously to two terms by the electoral college without a party affiliation. In fact, he hated the political parties that developed within his administration, said Mary Thompson, research historian at the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington at Mount Vernon. A political party system more reminiscent of today did not develop until the 1830s, but within Washington’s cabinet, Alexander Hamilton, his secretary of treasury, and Thomas Jefferson, the secretary of state, created warring factions — Federalists and so-called Jeffersonian Republicans — that sparred over important issues of the day. In his 1796 farewell address, Washington denounced the formation of political parties as ""likely, in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of government; destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion."" In that sense, it might be fair to say Washington was our only truly independent president. But, Thompson said, it’s more complicated. ""It is probably okay to call him ‘an independent,’ even though he often sided with the Federalist Party and thought most like them on major issues of the day,"" Thompson said. This included the formation of the national bank and the need for a strong central government. Thomas Jefferson Jefferson, too, is a bit more complicated because political parties were not prominent during his entire political career. In 1779, while on diplomatic assignment to France, he spoke poorly of parties. ""I never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of men whatever in religion, in philosophy, in politics, or in any thing else where I was capable of thinking for myself,"" he wrote. However, that changed once Washington named him the country’s first secretary of state in 1790 and ""he became embroiled in the politics of the 1790s,"" said Gaye Wilson, Shannon Senior Historian at the Robert H. Smith International Center for Jefferson Studies at Monticello. Jefferson is widely credited, along with James Madison, for starting the Democratic-Republican Party to combat the Federalists of the time. In 1795, he justified the formation of this party: ""Where the principle of difference is as substantial and as strongly pronounced as between the republicans & the Monocrats (Federalists) of our country I hold it as honorable to take a firm and decided part, and as immoral to pursue a middle line,"" he wrote. Perhaps before his national political career began and during a time largely void of parties, Jefferson was not affiliated with one. However, ""by the time he is serving as vice president and then president, his affiliation with the Democratic-Republicans is very clear,"" Wilson said. Abraham Lincoln Not only was Lincoln never an independent, as one would use it today, ""Lincoln was a devoted party man,"" said Michael Burlingame, the distinguished chair in Lincoln Studies at the University of Illinois Springfield. ""A free people, in times of peace and quiet — when pressed by no common danger — naturally divide into parties. At such times, the man who is of neither party, is not — cannot be, of any consequence,"" Lincoln said in his eulogy of Kentucky Sen. Henry Clay. Lincoln did, however, switch parties, though only out of necessity. Between 1832 and 1856, Lincoln was a member of the Whig party, which by that time was dying out. ""He was so reluctant to leave the Whigs, he was one of the last prominent Whigs to leave the party,"" said Sidney Milkis, political science professor at the University of Virginia and author of The President and the Parties: The Transformation of the American Party System Since the New Deal. Lincoln joined the Republican Party in 1856 and remained a member until 1864. That's when Lincoln ran for a second term as president as part of the National Union Party, ""the name the Republicans adopted (during the Civil War) to appeal to more Democratic voters,"" said Burlingame, author of several Lincoln biographies. But Lincoln never ran as an independent for president or even as a third-party candidate. ""Of all those guys on that list, Lincoln is the most dedicated partisan,"" said Milkis. Theodore Roosevelt While Roosevelt did wage an unsuccessful presidential campaign as a third-party candidate, historians we spoke with adamantly refuted that he was, at any point, an independent. ""He was never an independent,"" said John Cooper, a history professor at the University of Wisconsin and author of The Warrior and the Priest: Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt. ""He was always a party man. The question was, ‘Which party?’ "" Cooper and Milkis both noted that in 1884, many of the Republican elites so much detested their party’s presidential nominee, James Blaine, that they left the party and supported the candidacy of Democrat Grover Cleveland for president instead. Roosevelt, however, who also did not like Blaine, stuck with the party and was denounced for it. Roosevelt was the vice presidential candidate on the successful Republican ticket led by William McKinley in 1900. McKinley was assassinated in 1901, making Roosevelt president. He again ran for president, and won, as a Republican in 1904. However, after his term, he grew agitated with his handpicked successor, William Taft, who he believed was catering to the conservative wing of the party instead of continuing to move it in a progressive direction. So Roosevelt decided to run for president again in 1912, this time on the Progressive party ticket. But this wasn’t some nascent effort. Roosevelt recruited candidates nationwide, even in statehouse races, to join the party. He became the only third-party candidate to finish second in a presidential election. ""It was probably the most important political third party of American history,"" Milkis said. ""But he did not run as an independent."" Our ruling Pressler, an independent, said, ""All four on Mount Rushmore, they were independents at one point in their career."" It would be an effective campaign pitch, particularly in the home state of the iconic monument, but alas, it’s rubble. Of the four, Washington is probably the one with the most independent bona fides. You can perhaps make the case Jefferson was an independent ""at one point"" very early when parties were less common, but he went on to prominently serve as a Democratic-Republican — a party he helped found — as both vice president and president. However, there is no gray area when it comes to Lincoln and Roosevelt. Both switched parties, but were always affiliated with one and spoke of their importance. They never ran nor served as independents. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/16/larry-pressler/larry-pressler-independent-senate-candidate-claims/

Scott accuses Crist of voting against minimum wage hike in state Senate
","Gov. Rick Scott was sure to bring allegations that Charlie Crist has changed positions to Wednesday night’s debate in Davie, including the new Democrat’s stance on raising the minimum wage. After former Gov. Crist said he supported raising the minimum wage to $10.10, echoing a plan by President Barack Obama, Scott attacked the newly minted Democrat. ""He voted against minimum wage when he was in the Senate,"" Scott said. ""He didn’t think it was the right thing to do, so he voted against it."" We’ve looked into Crist’s record before on the minimum wage. There’s some evidence that earlier in his career, Crist opposed raising the minimum wage. But there’s no evidence to show that Crist voted on the minimum wage when he was a state legislator. When the Republican Party of Florida accused Crist earlier this summer of voting against a minimum wage increase, he said that wasn’t so. ""I haven’t taken a vote since 1998,"" he told us then. That year was the tail end of his term in the state Senate, a seat he won in 1992. The GOP told us a commercial it had run attacking Crist for a vote against raising the minimum wage was referring to 2004, when Crist was attorney general.   That year, Florida voted in favor of a ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage by $1, to $6.15 an hour. Before then, there was no state minimum wage, only the federally mandated minimum. After the measure passed, the state’s minimum wage went up and was tied to inflation. This year it went up 14 cents an hour and is now $7.93. As attorney general, Crist had no say about whether the measure passed or not. But he also was a board member of the state’s public-private economic development agency Enterprise Florida, which did take a position on the minimum wage. Meeting minutes showed that on Aug. 19, 2004, the board held a teleconference in which members voted unanimously to oppose the minimum wage increase. The voice vote was a statement of principle and was not binding. Attorney General Crist was present at the meeting. Crist barely mentioned the issue until this year, and there is no record it has come up before now. Crist's campaign did not have any response to Scott's statement about Crist taking a Senate vote on the minimum wage. Karen Woodall, executive director of the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, said there had been voting on the minimum wage in the House while Crist was in the Senate, but there were no votes in the Senate. Miami Beach Democrat Jack Gordon had filed a bill in 1992, but that fight ended before Crist was elected. Another bill was filed in 1994 by Howard Forman, D-Hollywood, but it died in committee with no action taken. The House filed a bill with no Senate companion in 1997, but that also failed. The Scott campaign did not clarify Scott’s response, instead pointing out the 2004 vote. With no evidence the issue came up during Crist’s Senate term, it’s possible the governor meant the 2004 voice vote for Enterprise Florida. There’s no evidence of any Senate action between 1993 and 1999, when Crist was there. Our ruling Scott said Crist ""voted against minimum wage when he was in the Senate."" Crist served on the board of Enterprise Florida when the group opposed an increase to Florida’s minimum wage in 2004. At the time, he was attorney general. But there’s no evidence that Crist ever voted on minimum wage legislation as a state senator. It’s entirely possible Scott misspoke, but there’s no evidence of any such vote during Sen. Crist’s term.

Viral claim says IRS will be delaying tax refunds next year, but it's fake news
","Readers recently forwarded us a claim they had begun seeing in their inbox -- and which their friends were believing. It was a link to a story headlined, ""2014 Federal Tax Refunds To Be Delayed Until October 2015."" This would be a pretty big deal if true. Is it? The short answer is: No. It turns out that the article was published in September 2014 on a website called the National Report. Here’s a portion of the article: ""Normally when you file your taxes, whatever money is owed back to you is quickly repaid. The process of getting your money back has been made even quicker in recent years through the use of E-file and direct deposit of federal tax rebates. But starting in 2015, federal tax refunds for the 2014 fiscal year are going to take longer for Americans to receive. A lot longer. ""The deadline to have your federal taxes filed will remain April 15th, but under new directives issued to the IRS, no refunds are to be issued before October 15th, 2015. This means that early filers who normally receive their refunds around the beginning of February will have to wait an additional 7 months longer than normal to get the money owed to them. ""White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest defended the upcoming changes to IRS tax refund policy. 'It’s a minor cost saving measure initiated by the administration with bipartisan support,' said Earnest. 'The recommendation to initiate this new refund structure came out of the Committee On Ways And Means, under the leadership of Republican Congressman David Camp. Absolutely zero dollars are going to be kept that is owed to hardworking Americans. All you are seeing here is a policy change streamlining the way in which the IRS structures tax refund repayments. Americans who find this objectionable can always opt to bring their tax withholding more in line with the actual taxes they will owe in the future.' "" The article went on to quote two Republican senators critical of the move -- Rand Paul of Kentucky and John McCain of Arizona. A lot of people appeared to believe it. The article was shared 647,000 times on Facebook since it was published. Forbes tax columnist Kelly Phillips Erb was among those who noted its wide reach. There is one problem with the claim: It comes from a fake-news site. The last time we checked a bogus claim from National Report, the site had a disclaimer that said ""the views expressed by writers on this site are theirs alone and are not reflective of the fine journalistic and editorial integrity of National Report."" This disclaimer has since been removed by the site. Another, clearer disclaimer -- also removed -- has been archived by urban-legend investigation site Snopes.com. The disclaimer said, ""National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental."" We reached out several times to the IRS to see if we could get an official disclaimer from the agency, but we never heard back.   Our Ruling A chain email has been circulating with a link to an article headlined, ""2014 Federal Tax Refunds To Be Delayed Until October 2015."" However, the article comes from the National Report, a satire website. It is not accurate and was never intended to be.

Tom Cotton says he wouldn't back changes for those on Medicare, but the ACA repeal he supports would
","During a debate in the hotly contested Arkansas Senate race, Republican Tom Cotton and Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor squared off over the question of Medicare and how it would be affected by the Affordable Care Act, the health care law sometimes called Obamacare. A moderator kicked off the exchange by noting that TV ads in the race had made several claims about possible changes to Medicare and where the candidates stood on those changes. Pryor was asked, ""What specifically would you change about the current system, if anything?"" Pryor answered by parrying a charge that he had voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare by voting for Obamacare. (We have rated Cotton’s earlier claim that Pryor ""cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare"" by $700 billion Half True.) In fact, Pryor said that Cotton ""has voted for that very same $700 billion (cut) he loves to criticize me for."" (We rated a close variation of that claim True.) When given an opportunity to respond, Cotton took the questioner’s claim head-on. Cotton said, ""The answer to your question is: I will make no changes to the current (Medicare) system for current retirees and anyone approaching retirement."" We wondered if that was what his platform really shows. The answer hinges on two separate questions. First, Does Cotton support repeal of Obamacare? And second, if Obamacare is repealed, would that prompt changes to Medicare either for current retirees or people approaching retirement? The short answers are yes and yes. Here are the more detailed explanations. Does Cotton support the repeal of Obamacare?  Cotton’s staff didn’t return an inquiry from PolitiFact, but we found lots of examples of Cotton arguing that Obamacare should be repealed. • ""I will fight to repeal and replace Obamacare with free-market reforms that empower patients and doctors to make health-care decisions. … Obamacare must be repealed entirely."" -- Cotton’s House of Representatives office website, accessed Oct. 15, 2014. • I ""will fight to repeal Obamacare."" -- Cotton’s Facebook page, accessed Oct. 15, 2014. • ""What we have to do is repeal Obamacare, start over, and get it right."" -- Cotton at a press conference with former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, Aug 21, 2014. • ""We would repeal Obamacare and replace it entirely with many reforms for our health care program."" -- Cotton at a press conference, April 13, 2014 • And most clearly, a pledge Cotton signed that says, ""I pledge to vote for all bills which seek to REPEAL the health care bill, HR 3590, signed into law on March 23, 2010. To that end, I do now and will in the next Congress endorse and vote for all measures, including discharge petitions, leading to its defunding, deauthorization, and repeal. I shall do so whether those measures are taken for the whole of the bill or those component parts that impose mandates, restrict patient and doctor choice and access, violate individual freedom and privacy, reduce healthy competition, increase costs, or raise taxes."" It’s worth noting that, at times, Cotton has expressed a desire to ""replace"" the newly repealed law with something else. However, we’ve failed to uncover an instance in which Cotton provided a detailed description of the Medicare policies that would be reinstated after a repeal. Cotton has also expressed an openness to more limited efforts, such as defunding the law, if a repeal can’t be achieved. Still, it’s clear from these comments that repeal is his first choice. Bottom line: Yes, Cotton has said consistently that he wants to repeal the law. If Obamacare is repealed, would that prompt changes to Medicare for current beneficiaries? It would. The highest-profile element of the law that would disappear in the event of a full repeal is the closing of the ""doughnut hole."" The law made strides to ease the previous, longstanding gap in coverage for beneficiaries in which they weren’t able to get government subsidies for prescription drug purchases under Medicare Part D. However, this isn’t the only example of a benefit included in the Affordable Care Act that would disappear for those currently on Medicare if the law is repealed and replacement provisions aren’t specifically enacted. Here are others, gleaned from the Kaiser Family Foundation’s summary of the health care law: • Elimination of cost-sharing for Medicare-covered preventive services. • Authorization of Medicare coverage of ""personalized prevention plan services,"" including an annual, comprehensive health-risk assessment. • Incentives to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries to complete behavior-modification programs, such as smoking cessation. • Reduction in the out-of-pocket amount that qualifies an enrollee for catastrophic coverage for prescriptions. • Expansion of Medicare coverage to individuals who have been exposed to environmental health hazards from living in an area subject to an emergency declaration made as of June 17, 2009, and have developed certain health conditions as a result. • Prohibition of Medicare Advantage plans from imposing higher cost-sharing requirements for some Medicare-covered benefits than is required under the traditional fee-for-service program. In other words, current Medicare beneficiaries would feel a significant impact if a replacement law is not forthcoming after a repeal. We see no evidence that Cotton has pledged to protect any of these specific provisions in the wake of a repeal. Our ruling Cotton said that under his platform, he ""will make no changes to the current (Medicare) system for current retirees and anyone approaching retirement."" Cotton has consistently supported repeal of Obamacare, and while he has sometimes noted that something needs to be enacted to ""replace"" the law, we couldn’t find any examples in which he specifically pledged to protect the Medicare policies that would be eliminated if the law was repealed, such as the closing of the doughnut hole and free preventive health-care services.
