Boehner claims Biden said the stimulus is scamming the American people
","The White House has been trumpeting the success of its economic stimulus package. President Barack Obama claimed that in its first 100 days, the plan ""saved or created"" 150,000 jobs (which we rated  Barely True  ). On June 8, 2009, Obama promised that number would quadruple by the fall.   Republicans are skeptical, however, saying the package hasn't delivered as many jobs as Obama claims. In response to Obama's latest promise, House Republican Minority Leader John Boehner offered this sharp criticism, calling the stimulus a ""bloated government spending scheme"" that hasn't helped the economy: ""Democrats said [the stimulus] would immediately create jobs, yet nearly four months later unemployment has continued to climb and none of their rosy predictions have come true,"" he said in a statement. ""Our plan to let the American people keep more of what they earn would have created twice the jobs at half the cost of the Democrats’ bloated government spending scheme. But instead of shifting course, Democrats are doubling down on their plan to spend taxpayer dollars as fast as possible, even as their own vice president admits that the American people are being scammed.""   We wondered if Boehner was right that Vice President Joe Biden had been so blunt in describing the legislative centerpiece of the Obama-Biden administration. Biden held a roundtable with business leaders on June 2 and discussed the stimulus plan and the administration's efforts to spend the money quickly but still avoid waste and fraud. An Associated Press account of that meeting said, ""With so much money at stake, Biden said some waste was inevitable and that a team of federal auditors had already uncovered problematic projects. 'People are being scammed already,' Biden said, promising to expose abuses whenever they were detected."" Biden was referring to the fact that some people have been lured by con artists who promise big stimulus bucks in return for personal information or a fee. Take Kristann Hartley, an Ohio woman featured in a National Public Radio report from March 9, 2009. Hartley applied for a stimulus grant to weatherize her home only to find out that the Web site offering the money was a scam. But Boehner's statement suggests Biden had a whole other meaning when he talked about 'people being scammed.' In reading the full text of Boehner's statement it's clear that Boehner was suggesting the stimulus spending plan itself is a mistake and that White House claims of positive economic effects are misleading. Using Biden's ""scammed"" remark in that context makes it sound like Biden was saying the same thing, acknowledging that the White House ""scamming"" the public by pretending the stimulus spending has been working. That's not what Biden meant at all. In fact, news coverage indicates the scammers Biden was talking about are garden-variety con artists merely using the stimulus as a cover, and that the programs they seek to exploit are just a minuscule portion of the $787 billion package. The Obama administration has emphasized many other anecdotes and news stories that show the stimulus working the way it is supposed to in helping local government avoid layoffs and helping states balance their budgets. Boehner may be technically correct that Biden mentioned people being scammed in the roundtable meeting. But Boehner incorrectly suggests the vice president called the stimulus a scam and he fails to note that Biden promised ""to expose abuses whenever they were detected,"" as the AP reported. We find Boehner's claim to be Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4CFF00>],/factchecks/2009/jun/08/john-boehner/boehner-claims-biden-said-stimulus-scamming-americ/
"['Abortion', 'National', 'Pundits', ""Bill O'Reilly""]","
Bill O'Reilly called George Tiller ""a baby killer"" without attribution
","Liberals are criticizing conservative talk show host Bill O'Reilly for his harsh comments about Dr. George Tiller, who was shot to death while attending church on May 31, 2009, in Wichita, Kan.  Their argument is that O'Reilly repeatedly named Tiller as a late-term abortion provider and called him a ""baby killer."" That publicity contributed to Tiller's death, they say. Antiabortion activist Scott Roeder, 51, has been charged with Tiller's murder. To be clear, we haven't found anyone saying that Roeder watched O'Reilly's show or was influenced by him directly. And we aren't attempting to check any claims or suggestions that O'Reilly's words incited violence. O'Reilly responded to his critics in an opinion article posted on BillOReilly.com and in the conservative journal  Human Events  . He began by saying that Tiller ""did not deserve his fate"" and was ""an American citizen entitled to protection."" ""No matter what you think about abortion, it is a sad day for the country when vigilantism takes a life,"" O'Reilly wrote. O'Reilly said that liberal groups were targeting him unfairly. ""Even though I reported on the doctor honestly, the loons asserted that my analysis of him was 'hateful,'"" O'Reilly wrote. ""Chief of among the complaints was the doctor's nickname, 'Tiller the baby killer.' Some prolifers branded him with that, and I reported it. So did hundreds of other news sources."" O'Reilly went on to criticize media outlets for glorifying Tiller in order to silence those who oppose abortion, especially late-term abortion. We wanted to see what O'Reilly had said about Tiller, to see if O'Reilly was indeed being criticized for his reporting on other groups' characterization of Tiller as he said. We searched transcripts of  The O'Reilly Factor  , his show that appears on the Fox News Channel. We found at least 42 instances of O'Reilly mentioning Tiller by name, going back to 2005. In 24 instances, we found that O'Reilly referred to Tiller specifically as a ""baby killer."" Most of the time, O'Reilly would simply refer to the Tiller as ""Tiller the baby killer"" or as ""Dr. George Tiller, known as Tiller the baby killer"" without attributing it to anyone. We found four times when O'Reilly said that ""some"" called him Tiller the baby killer. We did not find any instance where O'Reilly named an individual or a particular antiabortion group that referred to Tiller that way. Here is how O'Reilly has discussed Tiller in 2009, prior to Tiller's death: • May 15: O'Reilly discussed President Barack Obama's commencement speech at Notre Dame University, saying he was troubled that a Catholic school would allow Obama to speak. ""Barack Obama throughout his political career has enabled abortion. There's no doubt that he has. All right? He has recently appointed Gov. (Kathleen) Sebelius to (Secretary of) Health and Human Services. Gov. Sebelius is the most proabortion governor in the United States. Based upon Dr. Tiller, the baby killer in her state and all of that, all right."" • May 11: O'Reilly wondered whom Obama would nominate to the Supreme Court, saying that he thought Obama was ""callous"" when it came to abortion. ""I mean, the guy puts Sebelius in as the health — you can't get a more fanatically — and that woman is proabortion,"" O'Reilly said. ""She wants the babies done for. She supported Tiller the Baby Killer out there. So, enough with her."" • April 27: O'Reilly discussed Sebelius' nomination as secretary of Health and Human Services. O'Reilly said that Sebelius ""recently vetoed a bill that placed restrictions on late-term abortions in Kansas. The bill was introduced because of the notorious Tiller the Baby Killer case, where Dr. George Tiller destroys fetuses for just about any reason right up until the birth date for $5,000. There's no question Ms. Sebelius is one of the most proabortion politicians in America."" • March 27: Tiller was charged with misdemeanor offenses for violating Kansas law on late-term abortions. Tiller was acquitted. O'Reilly said, ""Now, we have bad news to report that Tiller the baby killer out in Kansas, acquitted. Acquitted today of murdering babies. I wasn't in the courtroom. I didn't sit on the jury. But this, there's got to be a special place in hell for this guy."" • March 26: O'Reilly talked about the ongoing trial: ""Another revolting situation is Dr. George Tiller in Kansas, known as Tiller the Baby Killer, who's on trial for killing babies who are about to be born, late-term abortions."" O'Reilly also said, ""If you want to kill a baby, you hire Tiller, you've got to pay him 5,000 up front, and he'll kill the baby. ... You should know, his best friend is the governor of Kansas, Sebelius. ... She has taken specific steps to carve out the law so that it will protect Tiller the baby killer."" • March 17: Still on the Tiller trial, O'Reilly said, ""You know this George Tiller, called Tiller the baby killer, is charged with 19 misdemeanors. And what this guy does, and we have proven it beyond a reasonable doubt, Kelly, is that he kills babies in late term. He aborts them in late term. They're no longer fetuses. They're viable babies. He aborts them for any and all reasons if you pay him $5,000."" • March 2: O'Reilly said Sebelius took ""campaign money from George Tiller, known as Tiller, the baby killer. He's currently charged with a variety of crimes centering on his abortion practice. He aborts babies at any time for just about any reason if you pay him $5,000."" • Jan. 26: O'Reilly discussed an executive order Obama signed allowing federal money to go to international family planning groups that provide abortions. O'Reilly complained that Obama quietly signed the order rather than publicizing it. ""I wanted George Tiller the baby killer going, 'Yeah, can I make more money killing babies now,'"" O'Reilly said. That's just from 2009. There were many other examples in previous years. These instances and others we reviewed clearly show that O'Reilly was not reporting the views of others, but was expressing his own views on the doctor. O'Reilly said in his column that ""Some prolifers branded"" Tiller a baby killer, ""and I reported it,"" as if he were reporting the views of others. But the transcripts show O'Reilly repeatedly referred to Tiller as a baby killer without attribution. So we find his statement that liberal groups are targeting him for his reporting of what others said to be False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A35B80>],/factchecks/2009/jun/05/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-called-george-tiller-baby-killer/
"['National', 'Religion', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama claims America is one of the largest Muslim countries
 ","
In the days leading up to his trip to Cairo to give a long-awaited speech before a large Muslim audience, President Barack Obama gave several radio and television interviews, including one in which he claimed that the United States has so many Muslim residents that it would qualify as one of the largest populations in the world.


""If you actually took the number of Muslims Americans (sic), we'd be one of the largest Muslim countries in the world,"" he told French television station Canal Plus.


Obama's comment was meant to emphasize the religious diversity of the United States and the importance of understanding between the Western world and followers of Islam, a key point in the speech he gave in Cairo on June 4, 2009.


""What I want to do is to create a better dialogue so that the Muslim world understands more effectively how the United States but also how the West thinks about many of these difficult issues like terrorism, like democracy,"" he told Canal Plus. ""Now, the flip side is I think that the United States and the West generally, we have to educate ourselves more effectively on Islam.""


Some PolitiFact readers heard Obama's claim and asked us to check it. We should note that estimates of the number of Muslims living in America varies greatly. For example, the Islamic Information Center, a group that educates people in the United States about Islam, says there are upwards of 8 million. And NationMaster.com, a Web site that allows users to compare different countries based on demographics, pegs the number at 6 million.


We are using numbers from the

CIA Online World Factbook,

a highly regarded government source for global statistics. It's updated twice a month, and we're relying on the latest version. By the

World Factbook's

count, Muslims in the United States make up about 0.6 percent of the population. That's around 1.8 million.


Using the CIA's data, we made a list of the 60 countries with the most Muslim residents. Coming in first is Indonesia, More than 240 million people live there, and 86.1 percent of the population identifies as Muslim. That means that about 206 million Indonesians are of the Islamic faith.


No. 2 on the list is Pakistan, where 95 percent of the roughly 176 million people identify as Muslim. That means about 167 million residents are of the Islamic faith. India, Bangladesh and Turkey come in next at 156 million, 129 million and 76 million, respectively.


Moving down the list, Morocco takes 10th place with 34 million Muslim residents, and Syria comes in at number 20, with about 18 million Muslims. The No. 60 slot goes to Serbia, home to 236,138 Muslims.


According to our calculations, you have to scroll down to the very bottom to see where the United States fits in amid all these statistics. Again, the

CIA Factbook

says that less than 1 percent — 0.6 percent to be precise — of the 307 million residents identify as Muslim. That means the United States has only 1.8 million Muslims.


So, of the 60 most populous Muslim states, the United States ranks 58th.


If we rely instead on NationMaster.com, which pegs the Muslim population at 6 million, the United States is 37th out of 60. And if we go with 8 million, as the Islamic Information Center estimates, the United States comes in at 29 on the list.


The exact number of how many Muslims are living in the United States is fuzzy at best. But one thing is for certain: No matter who you slice it, America ranks low, whether it's 1.8 million or 8 million.
 
So Obama is trying to make a point that the United States is in touch with the Muslim world because it has a substantial Muslim population. But he dramatically overreaches by saying the United States would be one of the largest Muslim countries in the world. Ranking 58 out of the world's 60 most populous Muslim nations does not a large Muslim country make. Indeed, by even the most generous estimate we found of 8 million, the United States still ranks 29 out of 60. As a result, we give Obama a Pants on Fire.

"['National', 'Energy', 'John Barrasso']","
Sen. John Barrasso claims Democrats against drilling for oil
","Oil exploration is the subject of a perennial debate in Washington. As gas prices rise during the hotter months, so does the passion to drill for oil in the United States. And once again, Senate Republicans are contending that Democrats oppose domestic drilling.   ""Even if we double our nation's wind and solar energy, and then double it again, it won't be enough to meet our energy needs,"" said U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, in the GOP's weekly radio address on May 26. ""There are billions of barrels of oil in the outer continental shelf and there's even more in Alaska. There's enough oil shale in the Rocky Mountain West alone to power America for the next 100 years. The Democrats say all this American energy is off limits.""   We've previously checked claims about  the extent of drilling  , so in this item we'll be examining whether it is correct to say that Democrats, generally speaking, are against oil drilling in the ocean, in Alaska and in the Western United States.   Barrasso's words echo a partisan battle from last summer, when gas prices reached $4 a gallon. House Republicans staged a chamber floor sit-in as a way to pressure Democrats into a debate over offshore drilling, which has been off limits in certain parts of the country. Democrats softened their stance at the end of 2008, when they agreed to let the prohibition expire.   It's not the first time Democrats have wavered on energy issues. Around the time that Democrats and Republicans were battling it out over drilling, then-Senator Barack Obama backtracked on his opposition to offshore drilling as well. ""My attitude is that we can find some sort of compromise,"" Obama told the  St. Petersburg Times  . ""If it is part of an overarching package then I am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem.""   Once in the White House, Obama put the brakes on some Bush-era oil drilling plans, including 77 oil and gas leases in Utah. But the Obama administration nevertheless maintains that drilling will be part of the president's larger plan to expand energy production. And contrary to Barrasso's claim, Democrats have voted to loosen the offshore drilling rules. For example, in 2008, 224 of the 231 House Democrats voted for a bill to fund the government until March 2009 that did not include the drilling moritorium, a ban that has been renewed in annual spending bills since 1982. Only one Senate Democrat, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, voted against the measure. In fact, some Democrats have been advocates for even more domestic drilling. A year ago, Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Kent Conrad — a Republican and a Democrat, respectively — created a bipartisan coalition to advance energy production in the United States. Included in that plan was language that would allow drilling off the Gulf of Mexico, as well as off the coasts of Virginia, North and South Carolina and Georgia so long as their state legislatures agreed. The group included Democrats Evan Bayh, Amy Klobuchar, Blanche Lincoln, Mark Pryor, Ben Nelson, Tom Carper and Ken Salazar.   Also among supporters was Louisiana Democrat Mary Landrieu, a longtime supporter of the oil industry, who said she supported the plan because it would allow the country to ""begin to drill for oil and gas on vast tracts of American land using American workers and producing American oil and gas.""   So, Barrasso is wrong to say that Democrats do not support offshore drilling. Plenty of them have in the past, and still do.   In Alaska, the issue is the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge, a tract of land that could produce upwards of 16 billion barrels oil, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Environmentalists fought development in that area, saying oil production would ruin the pristine habitat. Obama has long said he is against drilling in ANWR, and that stance has not changed since he has been in the White House. Democratic lawmakers feel the same, as a 2008 Senate vote on a GOP proposal to open up the refuge to drilling illustrates: Every Democrat except Landrieu voted against the plan. On this point, Barrasso is not so far off.   As for oil shale, Democrats have taken a wait-and-see approach. In a 2008 op-ed, then Sen. Ken Salazar summed up an opinion held by many of his fellow Democrats, saying that technology was not nearly advanced enough to exploit the oily rock that lies under Colorado, Utah and other Western states, but that the idea shouldn't be ruled out. ""Let's put the horse back in front of the cart and all start pulling in the same direction,"" wrote Salazar, who is now Obama's Interior Department secretary. ""A reckless approach that heightens the risk of an oil shale bust would only set us back.""   And remember those Bush-era oil shale leases we mentioned earlier? After Obama canceled the former administration's effort to sell off land for oil development, the Interior Department announced that it would issue a new round of leases after getting public comment on the issue.   So to review our findings: On offshore drilling, Barrasso is incorrect. Plenty of Democrats have supported finding more oil in our oceans. When it comes to drilling in Alaska, Barrasso is on firmer ground, since it is opposed by all but Landrieu. But on the last point — that Democrats don't support oil shale production — Democrats are cautious but not fully against it. So, all in all, Democrats may not be chanting ""drill, baby, drill,"" but they aren't ruling out the possibility either. Barrasso gets a Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972088C0>],/factchecks/2009/jun/04/john-barrasso/sen-john-barrasso-claims-democrats-against-drillin/

Gingrich reverses on calling Sotomayor a racist
","

Editor's Note: This is the first time we've deployed the Flip-O-Meter for a statement made on Twitter. It's truly a new era in political discourse

—

as long as the discourse can be contained in a 140-character tweet.


 
One week after calling Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor a racist through a tweet to his Twitter followers, Newt Gingrich says he is retracting the comment.
 
It all started on May 26 when President Barack Obama named Sotomayor his nominee for the nation's highest court. Conservatives quickly seized on her comment from a 2001 speech that she hoped that ""a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" The comment, they contended, showed Sotomayor would take race into account when making judicial decisions.


Gingrich, a Republican who is a possible presidential candidate in 2012, joined the chorus of conservative critics the morning of May 27 with this tweet: ""Imagine a judicial nominee said 'my experience as a white man makes me better than a latina woman' new racism is no better than old racism."" (sic)
 
Ten minutes later, he followed up with this: ""White man racist nominee would be forced to withdraw. Latina woman racist should also withdraw.""


Other prominent Republicans echoed those sentiments. Rush Limbaugh called her a ""reverse racist,"" and former Congressman Tom Tancredo said on MSNBC that ""she appears to be a racist.""
 
Republican senators, meanwhile, were more measured. Sen. Jeff Sessions, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said that his committee ""will engage in a fair and thorough examination of Ms. Sotomayor's previous judicial opinions, speeches, and academic writings to determine if she has demonstrated the characteristics that great judges share: integrity, impartiality, legal expertise, and a deep and unwavering respect for the rule of law.""


Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, went so far as to tell National Public Radio that Gingrich and Limbaugh's comments were ""terrible"" and that they were ""not helpful under any circumstances.""
 
Now, a little more than a week later, Gingrich is changing his tune.
 
""My initial reaction was strong and direct — perhaps too strong and too direct,"" Gingrich wrote June 3 on the conservative Web site Human Events. ""The sentiment struck me as racist and I said so. Since then, some who want to have an open and honest consideration of Judge Sotomayor's fitness to serve on the nation's highest court have been critical of my word choice. With these critics who want to have an honest conversation, I agree. The word 'racist' should not have been applied to Judge Sotomayor as a person, even if her words themselves are unacceptable.""


Gingrich isn't backing down completely. ""Sotomayor's words reveal a betrayal of a fundamental principle of the American system — that everyone is equal before the law,"" he wrote.
 
Still, he's done a full 180 on his boldest criticism and the one that has been repeated countlessly by the media. He called her a racist and is now retracting that comment, which earns a Full Flop.

McConnell claims Department of Justice disagreed with Sotomayor in Ricci firefighter case
","
Judge Sonia Sotomayor's ruling in a case involving a group of New Haven, Conn., firefighters continues to be the most talked about of the Supreme Court nominee's past cases.
 
Sen. Mitch McConnell sought to make Sotomayor's opinion look out of the mainstream by telling CNN that the Obama administration's Justice Department had disagreed. We find the truth is not so simple.
 
First, a quick explanation of the case:
 

Ricci vs. DeStefano

involves a group of mostly white firefighters who claimed reverse discrimination after the city threw out the results of promotional exams because white firefighters fared significantly better than black firefighters. If accepted, the test would have resulted in no black firefighters being eligible for promotion. The New Haven Civil Service Board said it was concerned the test may have violated ""anti-disparate-impact requirements"" of Title VII of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that the city would face an employment discrimination lawsuit from nonwhite applicants who were not promoted. So the board decided not to certify the exam results, and no one was promoted.
 
Eighteen firefighters — 17 whites and one Hispanic — filed a lawsuit against the city claiming the decision not to certify the exam results ""amounted to intentional discrimination"" against the white firefighters in favor of black firefighters due to their race and political support for the mayor, John DeStefano.
 
A federal district court judge who heard the case ruled in favor of the city, saying the city had the right to throw out the exams. The firefighters appealed to the 2nd Circuit, the court on which Sotomayor sits, and Sotomayor was part of a three-judge panel that upheld the district court decision.
 
Now the case is being considered by the U.S. Supreme Court.
 
On CNN's ""State of the Union"" program on May 31, 2009, McConnell, the Senate's Republican leader, was asked what troubled him most about the case.
 
McConnell said he had not yet read the case but ""the Department of Justice, under the Obama administration, disagrees with the decision"" Judge Sotomayor made.
 
We have

previously dissected

some of the legal issues of this case, so here we are examining whether the U.S. Justice Department disagreed with Sotomayor's decision.
 
In February 2009, the U.S. Justice Department did, in fact, enter a ""friend of the court"" brief asking the Supreme Court to vacate the appeals court ruling and ""remand"" the case back to the district court for further consideration of some issues.
 
But that doesn't mean they asked the Supreme Court to reverse the appeals court decision and rule in favor of the firefighters.
 
In fact, the Justice Department brief backed up many of the arguments made by the district court judge that were later affirmed by Sotomayor's appeals court. In one of the central issues of the case, the Justice Department attorneys argued an employer does not violate discrimination laws ""when it decides not to certify the results of a promotional test in order to comply with the statute’s disparate-impact prohibition.""
 
""Nor is declining to certify test results the equivalent of 'racial balancing' or imposing 'quotas,'"" the brief stated.
 
However, the Justice Department argued that the district and appeals court failed to ""adequately consider"" whether the city was hiding behind a civil rights argument, using it as a pretext for ""intentional racial discrimination"" against white employees.
 
In oral arguments before the Supreme Court on April 22, 2009, Edwin S. Kneedler, deputy solicitor general for the Justice Department, said that, in particular, the district court ought to look further into whether the city's decision to throw out the test was motivated by such factors as wanting to promote minority role models.
 
As for McConnell's statement that the Justice Department ""disagrees"" with Sotomayor's decision, we don't think that's accurate.
 
The Justice Department largely supports the legal arguments that underpinned the district court position in favor of the city, and which were later incorporated by the appeals court. But ultimately, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to send the case back to the lower court to reconsider some issues. And so we rule McConnell's statement Half True.

RNC chairman Michael Steele claims that the government will be part owner of General Motors
","
Shortly after General Motors filed for bankruptcy, a plan that will involve significant government ownership of the auto company, Republicans went into attack mode.


The General Motors restructuring plan ""is nothing more than another government grab of a private company and another handout to the union cronies who helped bankroll his presidential campaign,"" said Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele in a statement accompanying a newly minted ad. ""President Obama will now own 60 percent of GM, and his union buddies will own almost 20 percent. And what do the taxpayers get? They’ll get stuck with up to a $50 billion tab for the taxpayer dollars Obama is using to pay for his takeover of GM.""


In its bankruptcy filing, the company said it has $172.81 billion in debt and $82.29 billion in assets — all that despite a $20 billion General Motors has already received from the government, money that was initially earmarked for buying bad mortgages from banks.


Now, the company will adopt a restructuring plan that is ""tailored to the realities of today's auto market,"" said Obama. It's ""a plan that positions GM to move toward profitability, even if it takes longer than expected for our economy to fully recover; and it's a plan that builds on GM's recent progress in making better cars.""


So, there's no dispute that the government is invested in General Motors — it has already shelled out $20 billion in loans — but is Steele correct about the government's new financial ties to the ailing company?


We assume that by referring to President Obama owning 60 percent of the automaker, Steele means that the government as a whole will own that stake under the restructuring plan. In fact, the White House was the first to state this fact, during a May 31 briefing with reporters. By the administration's own words, the RNC is correct on this point.


Steele goes on to say that Obama's ""union buddies will own almost 20 percent."" To be exact, the United Auto Workers will get 17.5 percent of General Motor's common stock, plus cash to help pay for a $20 billion health care trust fund for retirees. Whether this is a boon to Obama's ""union buddies,"" as Steele's statement says, is a matter of opinion. However, it's worth noting that the UAW endorsed Obama for president and spent more than $4 million to assist his candidacy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.


So Steele is right that the administration will have a 60 percent ownership in the new General Motors and that the union will have nearly 20 percent. Steele earns a True.

150,000 jobs ""created or saved""? Maybe.
","Now that it's been 100 days since the economic stimulus package was signed into law, President Barack Obama is praising the measure for its job-creating impact. ""In these last few months, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has saved or created nearly 150,000 jobs — jobs building solar panels and wind turbines, making homes and buildings more energy efficient,"" Obama said during a visit to Las Vegas. ""They're the jobs of teachers and police officers and nurses who have not been laid off as a consequence of this Recovery Act. They're the jobs fixing roads and bridges, jobs at start-ups and small businesses, and jobs that will put thousands of young Americans to work this summer."" We were intrigued by that number of 150,000 jobs. Note the crucial point that it's jobs created or ""saved."" That means they're counting people who have avoided layoffs because of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. How do you count that? It's actually an estimate created by White House economists. Jared Bernstein, the chief economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, explained the number during a conference call with reporters on May 27, 2009. ""The 150,000 is a number that is derived relative to what's called a baseline, that is, relative to the amount of jobs we think we would be losing were the act not in place,"" Bernstein said. His argument is that even though the number of unemployed is increasing across the United States, the numbers would be bigger without the stimulus package. If you compare where employment is relative to where it would have been, ""that gap between those two, that's the 150,000 thus far,"" Bernstein said. ""We're looking at saving or creating another 600,000 over the next hundred days."" A reporter asked Bernstein where the administration thought the baseline would be in 100 days. But Bernstein said he couldn't project out that far. We've long  been   skeptical  when public officials throw out big numbers without explaining that they're talking about estimates. We're particularly wary of baselines, as we were for a previous ruling on Obama's claim  about deficit reduction  , because they can be unrealistic and exaggerate the impact of a policy. In the case of the stimulus, we're talking about the most significant economic downturn since the Great Depression and an unprecedented amount of government spending in an effort to get the economy going again. Certainly, the stimulus is creating some jobs. Anecdotal evidence from around the country, compiled by the Obama administration to promote its efforts, makes that case by showing that public employees in some cities and states have avoided layoffs. But those are just anecdotes. So can there be 150,000 in the first 100 days? ""It's certainly plausible given the consensus of most economists believe will be the result of the stimulus over the next few years,"" said James Horney, director of federal fiscal policy for the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. He pointed to testimony from Douglas Elmendorf, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress. Elmendorf said the recovery act should boost employment between 900,000 and 2.3 million by the end of the 2009. ""So 150,000 seems clearly within reason,"" Horney said. But a policy expert from a right-leaning think tank told us that Obama's number is ridiculous. ""They're just making up numbers and trying them out,"" said J.D Foster, senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who studies fiscal policy. ""In a period when the economy is bleeding 2 million jobs, to suggest that you can identify 150,000 jobs that you've saved or created is pure fantasy."" The economy has indeed lost 1.9 million jobs in February, March, and April, according to preliminary data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The May numbers will be announced June 5, 2009. We also talked with an economist at Moody's Economy.com, a business-oriented research group. Gus Faucher, the site's director of macroeconomics, said the stimulus has improved people's confidence about the economy, but he said it's not yet possible to put a firm number on jobs created. The data just isn't there yet, he said, and the Labor Department will continue to adjust its unemployment data over the course of many months. ""The answer is, it's too soon to tell,"" he said. ""We may not have an answer in months or even years in terms of an exact number."" Indeed, 100 days is a relatively small window to measure a package that will roll out over several years. It's important to note that the government itself has issued confusing data about what has been spent and not. On May 21, for example, the Recovery.gov Web site corrected a report that said that it had paid out $8.9 billion in unemployment money, when that was actually still money sitting in the bank waiting to be tapped. The recovery act has many reporting requirements, and states and localities are required to report on job creation. But much of that data is still coming in. (For even more details on how job data will be reported, check out this ProPublica story,  Is the Stimulus Stimulating Jobs? We May Never Know for Sure  .) We find that the stimulus is a complicated, ongoing effort and data collection is just getting started. The Obama administration does not provide a solid accounting for either the jobs ""created"" or ""saved."" Yes, there is anecdotal evidence that jobs are being saved, such as the 25 police recruits in Columbus, Ohio, in an example cited by Obama. But the 150,000 figure sounds specific and verifiable when actually it's the administration's best guess for a relatively small snapshot in time. Because it's not much better than a guess presented as a fact, we rate his statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B8E2C0>],/factchecks/2009/may/29/barack-obama/150000-jobs-created-or-saved-maybe/

North Korea contends that the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have conducted 99.99 percent of all nuclear tests
","
Facing international condemnation for a recent underground nuclear weapon test, the North Korean Foreign Ministry released a statement accusing the United Nations Security Council of hypocrisy.
 
""There is a limit to our patience,"" its Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried on the official Korean Central News Agency. ""The nuclear test conducted in our nation this time is the Earth's 2,054th nuclear test. The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have conducted 99.99 percent of the total nuclear tests.""
 
As a matter of policy, PolitiFact does not take totalitarian dictatorships at their word. Beyond that, we were simply curious which countries have done nuclear weapons testing, and how much. So we decided to check this claim.
 
According to a report from the Natural Resources Defense Council, there have been 2,051 nuclear tests worldwide since 1945 done by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council:
 
U.S. - 1,030
 
Russia/U.S.S.R - 715
 
U.K. - 45
 
France - 210
 
China - 45
 
There have been only a handful of other tests, although there are doubts about the exact number.
 
In 1974, India tested a nuclear device, although it produced a relatively small explosive yield. India claimed to have detonated five more nuclear devices in May 1998.  In response to the Indian tests, Pakistan announced that it had exploded five nuclear devices a couple weeks later.
 
It has been widely speculated that India and Pakistan exaggerated the number and size of the explosions for political reasons. Nonetheless, that's the number of announced nuclear tests.
 
Since then, North Korea is the only country to perform an announced test. Its first came in 2006. And then on May 26, 2009, North Korea announced that it had successfully conducted its second underground nuclear test, in defiance of international warnings.
 
(There has also been some speculation that Israel may have conducted a test in 1979, but those claims have never been substantiated.)
 
So arguably, there have been as many as 13 nuclear tests conducted by countries other than the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, said Carey Sublette, creator of the Nuclear Weapon Archive, which tracks nuclear testing via public records. By Sublette's count, there have been a total of 2,054 nuclear tests. That means 99.37 percent of all the tests were done by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, he said.
 
""It's about right,"" Sublette said of the figures cited by North Korea. ""If it's off, it's only off by a few (tests).""
 
We aren't inclined to quibble with fractions of one percent. We find North Korea's claim to be True.

Rush Limbaugh says Sotomayor disregarded law to rule against white firefighters
","While many Republican leaders have been publicly cautious with their opinions about President Barack Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor, radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh has been crystal clear about his opposition. ""Do I want her to fail to get on the court? Yes,"" Limbaugh said on his show on May 26, 2009. ""She'd be a disaster on the court."" In making his case, Limbaugh cited a Sotomayor ruling that has drawn scrutiny from critics this week. ""She ruled against the white firefighter — Ricci and other white firefighters — just on the basis that she thought women and minorities should be given a preference because of their skin color and because of the history of discrimination in the past,"" Limbaugh said. ""The law was totally disregarded."" Limbaugh is referring to  Ricci vs. DeStefano  , a case involving firefighters in New Haven, Conn. A group of mostly white firefighters claimed reverse discrimination after the city threw out the results of promotional exams because white firefighters fared significantly better than black firefighters. Here's what happened. In late 2003, 118 New Haven firefighters took written and oral exams for promotion to the ranks of captain and lieutenant. Among the 41 who took the captain exam (eight of them black), no blacks and at most two Hispanics would have been eligible for promotion to captain. And of the 77 who took the lieutenant exam (19 of them black, 15 Hispanic), the results indicated that no blacks or Hispanics would be promoted to the rank of lieutenant. The New Haven Civil Service Board worried the test may have violated ""anti-disparate-impact requirements"" of Title VII of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that the city would face an employment discrimination lawsuit from nonwhite applicants who were not promoted. So the board decided not to certify the exam results, and no one was promoted. The white firefighters, naturally, were ticked off. One of them, John Ricci, is dyslexic, and studied hard to score highly on one of the exams, only to have it invalidated. Eighteen firefighters, 17 whites and one Hispanic, filed a lawsuit against the city claiming the decision not to certify the exam results ""amounted to intentional discrimination"" against the white firefighters in favor of black firefighters due to their race and political support for the mayor, John DeStefano. The federal district court judge who heard the case ruled in favor of the city. The firefighters appealed to the 2nd Circuit, the court on which Sotomayor sits. A three-judge panel that included Sotomayor upheld the district court ruling with a one paragraph explanation: ""We affirm, substantially for the reasons stated in the thorough, thoughtful, and well-reasoned opinion of the court below. In this case, the Civil Service Board found itself in the unfortunate position of having no good alternatives. We are not unsympathetic to the plaintiffs' expression of frustration. Mr. Ricci, for example, who is dyslexic, made intensive efforts that appear to have resulted in his scoring highly on one of the exams, only to have it invalidated. But it simply does not follow that he has a viable Title VII claim. To the contrary, because the Board, in refusing to validate the exams, was simply trying to fulfill its obligations under Title VII when confronted with test results that had a disproportionate racial impact, its actions were protected."" The brevity of that response, and its lack of analysis, rankled one dissenting appeals court judge, Jose Cabranes. ""The opinion contains no reference whatsoever to the constitutional claims at the core of this case, and a casual reader of the opinion could be excused for wondering whether a learning disability played at least as much a role in this case as the alleged racial discrimination,"" Cabranes wrote. ""This perfunctory disposition rests uneasily with the weighty issues presented by this appeal."" Subsequently, the Supreme Court decided to take up the case, and heard arguments in April. But back to Limbaugh's claim. That Sotomayor ruled against ""white firefighter Ricci and other white firefighters"" is undisputed. But this is a very complex legal case and Limbaugh misleads when he boils down the ruling by Sotomayor (and two other appeals court judges), saying it was made ""just on the basis that she thought women and minorities should be given a preference because of their skin color and because of the history of discrimination in the past. The law was totally disregarded."" The ruling by the three-judge panel makes no mention of giving preferential treatment to women or minorities, as Limbaugh suggested. Rather, it upholds a district court decision that the city had the right to throw out a test it felt led to racially disparate results. The first sentence of the panel's statement is also significant. The judges begin by saying they agree with the district court ruling ""substantially for the reasons stated in the thorough, thoughtful, and well-reasoned opinion of the (district court)."" In other words, without laying out all those opinions, they were essentially incorporating what the district court said. So we took a look at the  opinions delivered by District Judge Janet Arterton  on Sept. 28, 2006. The first thing we note is that the opinion cites numerous other cases to back up various points. That alone weakens Limbaugh's claim that ""the law was totally disregarded."" Moreover, Judge Arterton lays out very specific legal reasons for her decision. ""Nothing in the record in this case suggests that the City defendants or CSB (Civil Service Board) acted 'because of' discriminatory animus toward plaintiffs or other non-minority applicants for promotion,"" Arterton wrote. ""Rather, they acted based on the following concerns: that the test had a statistically adverse impact on African-American and Hispanic examinees; that promoting off of this list would undermine their goal of diversity in the Fire Department and would fail to develop managerial role models for aspiring firefighters; that it would subject the City to public criticism; and that it would likely subject the City to Title VII lawsuits from minority applicants that, for political reasons, the City did not want to defend."" The judge cites several cases which, she wrote, ""clearly establish"" that a public employer faced with the threat of a lawsuit over a test with racially disparate results does not violate civil rights laws by taking ""neutral, albeit race-conscious, actions to avoid such liability."" The judge argued the white firefighters could not claim to have been discriminated against because ""here, all applicants took the same test, and the result was the same for all because the test results were discarded and nobody was promoted."" In siding with the city, the judge wrote that the city's ""motivation to avoid making promotions based on a test with a racially disparate impact, even in a political context, does not, as a matter of law, constitute discriminatory intent, and therefore such evidence is insufficient for plaintiffs to prevail on their Title VII claim."" We cite some of this not just to make your head hurt, or to make the case that the ruling was correct — that will ultimately be up to the Supreme Court — but to show the complicated legal issues involved, as well as the fact that the district court did, in fact, make reasoned legal arguments and cited numerous legal cases to underpin its decision. In other words, you may not agree with the conclusions, but it's wrong to suggest the judges ""totally disregarded"" the law. Nor did Sotomayor's panel or the district court ever suggest that the city ought to give preferential treatment to women and minorities. And so we rule Limbaugh's statement Barely True.

Libertarian party claims Sonia Sotomayor has had four rulings thrown out by the Supreme Court
","
Shortly after President Barack Obama announced Sonia

Sotomayor

as his pick for the Supreme Court, conservatives pulled this bit out of their arsenal:

Sotomayor

is not up to the job because some of her cases have been thrown out by the Supreme Court.


Wendy E. Long of the Judicial Confirmation Network was one of the first to knock

Sotomayor's

record, saying that she ""has an extremely high rate of her decisions being reversed, indicating that she is far more of a liberal activist than even the current liberal activist Supreme Court."" Wendy Wright of Concerned Women for America echoed that talking point, saying that

Sotomayor's

""high reversal rate alone should be enough for us to pause and take a good look at her record.""


Then there was this from the Libertarian National Committee: ""

Sotomayor

has had her rulings thrown out by the court a troubling four times."" We learned pretty quickly that the veracity of this statement depends on a few variables.


Let's start by looking at

Sotomayor's

11-year tenure on the 2

nd

U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. We found that she has authored hundreds of officially published majority opinions — the White House puts the exact number at 380 — and of those, six have been heard by the Supreme Court.


Three have been reversed:


Riverkeeper

Inc. vs. EPA

;

Merrill Lynch vs.

Dabit


; and


Malesko

vs. Correctional Services Corp

. Among the other three cases: The Supreme Court affirmed her ruling in

Empire

Healthchoice

Assurance Inc. vs. McVeigh

. It affirmed her ruling but but unanimously rejected her reasoning in

Knight vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue

. The sixth case,


Ricci

vs.

DeStefano


, is still pending. So her record so far at the appellate level is three reversals, two upheld and one pending.


There's also her time on the U.S. District Court between 1992 and 1998. One of her rulings,


Tasini

vs. New York Times,

et


al.


, was reversed by the Supreme Court in 1997. That's how the Libertarian Party gets to its total of four

reversed

opinions.


Keep in mind that other Supreme Court justices have seen their share of reversals. For the sake of comparison, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, like Sotomayor, wrote hundreds of majority opinions during his 16-year tenure on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. At least two of those were heard by the

Supreme

Court and both were reversed:

Jo Anne B.

Barnhart

, Commissioner of Social Security, Petitioner vs. Pauline Thomas

and


Rompilla

vs. Beard

.


We were also caught up by the word ""troubling"" in the Libertarian Party's statement, so we turned to Stephen

Wermiel

, a law professor at American University Washington College of Law, for some perspective. In fact, the Supreme Court increasingly has a reputation for reversing most of the approximately 80 cases it hears every term,

Wermiel

said. Indeed, according to data compiled by

SCOTUSblog

.com, the Supreme Court's reversal rate in 2008 was 85 percent, 61 percent in 2007, and 72 percent in 2006.


Having a case reversed ""is not a badge of shame, or a stigma of stupidity or inferiority,""

Wermiel

said. ""It's a sign that reasonable minds had a different approach to the issue.""


Tom

Goldstein

, a partner at law firm Akin

Gump

and author of

SCOTUSblog

.com, agreed. ""In a career as long as [

Sotomayor's

], she's easily in the mainstream,"" compared to the reversal rate of other judges.


""The numbers game is childish,"" said Michael

Greve,

a legal scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""You are dealing with all of six cases. What of it?"" The best way to evaluate

Sotomayor

— or anyone else nominated to the highest court — is to look at individual opinions, he added.


So the Libertarian Party is correct that

Sotomayor

was reversed four times: three at the appellate level and one at the district court level. But this is out of hundreds of potential cases. Furthermore, the Libertarian Party's implication that four cases represents a high rate of reversal just doesn't hold up. Her record is not far off from another well-known justice, Samuel

Alito

, nor is it at all unusual for the Supreme Court to reverse most of the cases it hears every year, according to legal experts we spoke to. We rate their statement Half True.

Sotomayor's comment about Latina women versus white men
","
If you've been following the story of Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor via cable news, you've undoubtedly heard this sound bite from a 2001 Sotomayor speech:
 
""I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.""
 
For many conservative detractors, the quote has formed the centerpiece of their opposition.
 
In a released statement, Wendy E. Long, counsel to the Judicial Confirmation Network, a conservative nonprofit, said, ""Judge Sotomayor is a liberal judicial activist of the first order who thinks her own personal political agenda is more important than the law as written. She thinks that judges should dictate policy, and that one’s sex, race and ethnicity ought to affect the decisions one renders from the bench.""


Previously, we have looked at the issue of Sotomayor's statement about judges

making policy

. Here we look at the claim that Sotomayor thinks ""that one’s sex, race and ethnicity ought to affect the decisions one renders from the bench.""
 
A number of Republicans have expressed concern about the statement.
 
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said that due to Sotomayor's comments, the Senate will need to weigh ""her ability to rule fairly without undue influence from her own personal race, gender or political preferences.""
 
On his blog, Newt Gingrich wrote this about Sotomayor's nomination: ""Imagine a judicial nominee said 'my experience as a white man makes me better than a Latina woman' Wouldn't they have to withdraw? New racism is no better than old racism. A white man racist nominee would be forced to withdraw. Latina woman racist should also withdraw.""
 
Asked repeatedly about Sotomayor's comments during the daily White House press briefing on May 27, 2009, spokesman Robert Gibbs admonished reporters not to make a judgment on an 8-second sound clip from a 40-minute speech. Gibbs said he was confident that when people looked at the totality of Sotomayor's speech, and the context of the comment in question, they would ""come to a reasonable conclusion on this.""
 
So we read the whole speech, titled ""A Latina Judge's Voice,"" which was delivered by Sotomayor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law in 2001, and was later published in the Spring 2002 issue of

Berkeley La Raza Law Journal.

 
The purpose of the speech, she said, was to ""talk to you about my Latina identity, where it came from, and the influence I perceive it has on my presence on the bench."" She described herself as ""Newyorkrican,"" a born and bred New Yorker of  Puerto Rican-born parents, and talked about her close affinity to the Puerto Rican culture as well as her love of America, and how being Latina helped to shape who she is.
 
She then begins to discuss what it will mean to have more women and people of color on the bench.
 
""While recognizing the potential effect of individual experiences on perception, Judge (Miriam) Cedarbaum nevertheless believes that judges must transcend their personal sympathies and prejudices and aspire to achieve a greater degree of fairness and integrity based on the reason of law,"" Sotomayor said. ""Although I agree with and attempt to work toward Judge Cedarbaum's aspiration, I wonder whether achieving that goal is possible in all or even in most cases. And I wonder whether by ignoring our differences as women or men of color we do a disservice both to the law and society. Whatever the reasons why we may have different perspectives, either as some theorists suggest because of our cultural experiences or as others postulate because we have basic differences in logic and reasoning, are in many respects a small part of a larger practical question we as women and minority judges in society in general must address. I accept the thesis of a law school classmate, professor Steven Carter of Yale Law School, in his affirmative action book that in any group of human beings there is a diversity of opinion because there is both a diversity of experiences and of thought.""
 
""I further accept that our experiences as women and people of color affect our decisions,"" Sotomayor said. ""The aspiration to impartiality is just that — it's an aspiration because it denies the fact that we are by our experiences making different choices than others.""
 
Sotomayor spoke briefly about the contributions of women judges and attorneys in race and sex discrimination cases, while acknowledging that Supreme Courts made up completely of white men have made seminal decisions on those issues. It's in that context that Sotomayor made the statement heard round the world via YouTube.
 
""Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences ... our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging. Justice O'Connor has often been cited as saying that a wise old man and wise old woman will reach the same conclusion in deciding cases. ... I am ... not so sure that I agree with the statement. First, as professor Martha Minnow has noted, there can never be a universal definition of wise. Second, I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.


""Let us not forget that wise men like Oliver Wendell Holmes and Justice Cardozo voted on cases which upheld both sex and race discrimination in our society. Until 1972, no Supreme Court case ever upheld the claim of a woman in a gender discrimination case. I, like professor Carter, believe that we should not be so myopic as to believe that others of different experiences or backgrounds are incapable of understanding the values and needs of people from a different group. Many are so capable. As Judge Cedarbaum pointed out to me, nine white men on the Supreme Court in the past have done so on many occasions and on many issues including

Brown

.""
 
Sotomayor later concludes that ""personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see. My hope is that I will take the good from my experiences and extrapolate them further into areas with which I am unfamiliar. I simply do not know exactly what that difference will be in my judging. But I accept there will be some based on my gender and my Latina heritage. ... I can and do aspire to be greater than the sum total of my experiences, but I accept my limitations. I willingly accept that we who judge must not deny the differences resulting from experience and heritage but attempt, as the Supreme Court suggests, continuously to judge when those opinions, sympathies and prejudices are appropriate.""
 
You can read the whole speech for yourself right

here

.
 
Tom Goldstein, a partner at Washington law firm Akin Gump and the founder of ScotusBlog, a widely read blog on the Supreme Court, read the speech and concluded it amounted to little more than Sotomayor acknowledging that judges, like anyone, are products of where and how they grew up.
 
""Having that context can be valuable for a judge,"" Goldstein said. ""There are some cases, like cases of discrimination, where if you have been in someone's shoes, you can better understand it.""
 
By way of reminder, we are fact-checking the statement from the Judicial Confirmation Network that Sotomayor's statement shows that she thinks ""that one’s sex, race and ethnicity ought to affect the decisions one renders from the bench."" We think the key words in that sentence are ""ought to."" To the contrary, Sotomayor says several times that she agrees judges should aspire to ""transcend their personal sympathies and prejudices."" However, she acknowledges that we are all informed by our experiences and that ""personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see."" And, she concludes, when it comes to things like race and sex discrimination, that kind of diversity of experience can be an asset. In context, it's clear that Sotomayor isn't suggesting the intellect of Latina women is superior to that of white men, only that a greater diversity of experience and thought would be a valuable addition to the court system. And so we rate the Judicial Confirmation Network's statement Half True.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Sotomayor Nomination', 'Supreme Court', 'Barack Obama']","
Sotomayor's experience does not significantly outstrip other justices
","
President Barack Obama introduced his first nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court with much praise.
 
""It's a measure of her qualities and her qualifications that Judge Sotomayor was nominated to the U.S. District Court by a Republican president, George H.W. Bush, and promoted to the Federal Court of Appeals by a Democrat, Bill Clinton,"" Obama said. ""Walking in the door she would bring more experience on the bench, and more varied experience on the bench, than anyone currently serving on the United States Supreme Court had when they were appointed.""
 
Listening to that quote, you might think Sotomayor was way ahead of the other justices when they were nominated. But after our review of the current justices, we find that Sotomayor has roughly the same experience they had.
 
Nevertheless, Obama's statement is technically accurate. Here's why:
 
It appears Obama is only counting legal experience obtained on the federal district courts or courts of appeal. It may surprise you to know that a judge need not sit on the district court level before being named to the higher appellate court. Compared with the sitting Supreme Court justices, Sotomayor is the only one to have experience on both the district court level

and

the appellate level. Hence Obama's claim that she has ""more varied"" experience.
 
But drill down into the numbers, and Sotomayor has more total federal court experience only by a single year, and two justices have more appellate experience than she does.
 
Sotomayor served six years on the district court level and 11 years on the appellate level for a grand total of 17 years. Contrast this with Samuel Alito, who sat on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for 16 years, or Stephen Breyer, who sat on the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals for 14 years, with four of those as the chief judge. If you consider Sotomayor more experienced than these justices, it's only by a margin of a year or two. And constitutional lawyers (or the judges' moms) might argue that Alito and Breyer's additional appellate experience is more relevant than experience at the district court level.
 
If we take a broader view of experience than only federal court service, Sotomayor is about the same as most of her would-be fellow justices. (We have compiled a detailed chart on the professional experience of Sotomayor and the Supreme Court justices and have included it at the end of this article.)
 
This year, Sotomayor will have graduated from law school 30 years ago, with a full legal career under her belt. This is very close to the average number of years of experience we calculated for other justices at the time they were nominated. We calculated the average working experience of the current justices — omitting David Souter, whom Sotomayor may replace — and found that the average professional career prior to Supreme Court appointment was 28.7 years. By our count, four justices have slightly more years than Sotomayor in their legal careers: John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Chief Justice John Roberts and Alito.
 
To be clear, people could argue a lot over what kind of legal experience is more relevant or important to serving on the Supreme Court. Our analysis is based on years of service, and doesn't reflect the quality of the work of any of the justices.
 
Listening to what Obama said, though — ""Walking in the door she would bring more experience on the bench, and more varied experience on the bench, than anyone currently serving on the United States Supreme Court had when they were appointed"" — you might conclude that Sotomayor is more qualified than previous nominees to be a Supreme Court Justice. In fact, her legal career and years of experience are in line with the other justices.
 
Obama's statement is technically accurate, but also implies she's more qualified. We don't find that to be the case. We rate Obama's statement Half True.
 

Editor's note: For brevity, we've omitted some details of their experience, such as additional educational credentials or service on some boards and commissions.

"['Ohio', 'Bush Administration', 'Economy', 'Trade', 'Lee Fisher']","
Fisher campaign claims Portman's plan is to ""tax, slash and privatize"" Social Security
","
Step on the third rail of American politics and you’ll get scorched by angry retirees. That adage about Social Security comes from the 1980s, but politicians like Ohio’s Lee Fisher are testing it against opponents today.

Fisher’s campaign seeks to singe Rob Portman, the rival running for U.S. Senate, for efforts to partially privatize Social Security in the past, and for potential Social Security benefit cuts and tax hikes in the future. In a July 12 news release, Fisher spokesman John Collins said:

""Seniors depend on a guaranteed monthly Social Security benefit -- especially in these tough times. Congressman Portman's plan to tax, slash and privatize these benefits would devastate Ohioans. Pure and simple.""

Pure and simple, it sounds scary. But is it true?

To support its claim, the Fisher campaign cited a Columbus Dispatch story in which Portman said he would look at ""everything on the table"" when considering how to deal with looming problems for entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare, ""including at least a discussion of possible tax increases and benefit cuts."" And Fisher’s news release said that while in Congress, Portman was ""an outspoken advocate for privatizing Social Security -- a plan which would have left Ohio's seniors devastated during this recent economic downturn.""

Asked to back up the claim further, Fisher’s campaign cited statements, TV and Web interviews, congressional hearings, and news articles from when Portman, a Cincinnati-area Republican, served in the House of Representatives and worked as President George W. Bush’s budget director.

It is indisputable that Portman supported Bush’s proposal to allow Americans to put part of their Social Security contributions into private accounts. Americans would be able to invest in stocks, bonds, government securities or stay out of the accounts entirely.

""I mean, this is what Einstein talked about, the magic, the greatest force in the universe, the power of compounding interest,"" Portman, then a congressman, said in a House Budget Committee hearing in 2005. ""That's what we're talking about here.""

It’s easy today to see how badly a Wall Street downturn would affect that magic in the short term. But that oversimplifies the case. Bush and congressional Republicans made their strongest push for privatization – they preferred to refer to it as private accounts – in 2005 but did not intend for such a program to start right away. Portman noted at a news conference in early 2007, when he was Bush’s budget director, that the president had already pushed back the proposed start date to 2010, and then in 2007 he pushed it back again to 2012.

At the time, Portman said the accounts would be strictly voluntary and comprise only a portion of anyone’s Social Security savings. Furthermore, Portman said in 1999, when the subject was in its incubation phase, that ""there must be a safety net for everybody so that no one’s Social Security benefits would be reduced."" This might have required a taxpayer bailout if stock market losses packed a wallop, but that’s not the issue here.

Still, Portman was unquestionably a privatization champion, saying in 2005 that it was reasonable to expect a 5 percent annual return on investment, ""which I think is conservative."" But that’s not the same as having a current ""plan to tax, slash and privatize these benefits,"" as the Fisher campaign suggests Portman has now.

Asked about any such plan, the Portman campaign said it hasn’t developed one. Portman has only said that everything must be on the table when discussing entitlement reform. 
That could put Portman at odds with AARP, which says that solutions must not come at the expense of ""today's seniors and future generations."" But it puts Portman on the same page as President Barack Obama , who said in April when naming a commission to address this nation’s debt: ""Everything has to be on the table.""

Collins, the Fisher spokesman, suggests this is a cop-out for Portman because right out of the gate, Portman includes the potential of tax increases, benefit cuts, or both. ""His plan includes an open discussion of taxing and slashing benefits,"" Collins said. ""And our plan would not start with that. We would not consider that.""

Portman has in fact said that Social Security’s solvency might require pain, although he viewed private accounts as better alternative. Otherwise, he said in 2005, ""We're going to have to raise taxes, we're going to have to borrow, we're going to have to cut benefits -- we're going to have to do something.""

In an interview with Human Events Online, Portman later said that private accounts would over the long term ""deal with the solvency issue.""

That was then, this is now -- and Portman has not mentioned private accounts in a long time or talked about whether his views have changed. He only says that with deficit, debt and entitlement problems growing, the nation needs a serious discussion. To get everyone to the table, says his spokeswoman, Jessica Towhey, Portman believes that no possible solutions should be eliminated out of hand.

As for the possible fears of seniors or anyone hoping to retire, she notes that as a congressman, Portman voted in 2000 to reduce the percentage of Social Security benefits subject to taxes. He voted in 1995 to repeal a tax increase on Social Security benefits. And he voted in 1996 to allow beneficiaries to earn more outside income without losing their Social Security benefits.

The claim against Portman has a substantial short-coming. Agreeing to hear others out is not the same as agreeing to ""slash"" or ""tax."" And favoring privatization before, in a dramatically different economic climate, is not the same as pushing for it now.

It would be credible to cite Portman’s past actions and question what he might do now. But in saying that Portman has a plan to do so, the claim becomes Barely True.

"['Abortion', 'Georgia', 'Women', 'Erick Erickson']","
RedState.com blogger said Nathan Deal voted to fund abortion
","
The bickering over which Republican candidate for governor is a stronger foe of abortion just won't stop.  

Last week, Georgia Right to Life accused Karen Handel of supporting abortion if a fetus tests positive for Down syndrome. We gave that claim our lowest rating, Pants on Fire.

Now Handel's opponent, Nathan Deal, stands accused of voting to fund abortions while he was a U.S. congressman in 1993. The Deal-Handel runoff is slated for Aug. 10. The winner will face former governor and Democrat Roy Barnes in November.

Erick Erickson, an influential blogger and editor of RedState.com, one of the most popular conservative sites on the Web, was the first to make the claim. It appeared Thursday on RedState.com and Erickson's PeachPundit.com, which focuses on state issues. The Macon city councilman supports former Secretary of State Handel's bid.

""In Congress, Nathan Deal Voted for Henry Waxman sponsored legislation to give $500 million to Planned Parenthood to pay for actual abortions,"" he wrote in identical items on RedState.com and PeachPundit posted after 8 p.m.

Deal? The candidate who won the endorsement of Georgia Right to Life? He voted to fund abortion with our tax dollars?

We fired off an e-mail to Erickson, who replied that the issue has ""nothing to do with Nathan Deal who I don't doubt is pro-life."" It's more about GRTL's conduct, he said.

So we took a look at his blog posts. 
The earliest item we located was ""Georgia Right To Life Supports Candidate Who Voted For Major Abortion Funding,"" which was posted on PeachPundit.com at 8:14 p.m. An identical one appeared on RedState.com at 8:24 p.m. 

""Hypocrisy, thy name is Georgia Right to Life,"" the post began.

It then stated a few paragraphs later that Deal voted for the Waxman legislation.

Waxman is a Democratic congressman who represents portions of the Los Angeles area. Planned Parenthood runs family planning clinics, some of which perform abortions.

Monday, Erickson wrote a 5 a.m. post that repeated the claim. ""Deal explicitly voted to fund abortions,"" it said.

Deal voted for the Family Planning Amendments Act of 1993. It passed the U.S. House of Representatives but not the Senate. It never became law. 

It was an authorization bill, which is a kind of legislation that establishes or re-establishes a government agency or program. It also recommends how much money should be spent on it.

This bill would have re-established the Title X program of the Public Health Service Act, which has funded family planning services such as providing birth control since 1970. The beneficiaries are mostly poor women. A portion of those funds go to Planned Parenthood clinics. Title X was authorized in another bill that passed. 

Amounts set by authorization bills are not binding. The feds don't cut any checks until another type of legislation, an appropriations bill, passes the House and Senate. So the 1993 bill didn't really fund anything at all, much less abortions.

Furthermore, the bill had nothing to do with ""actual abortions."" Title X explicitly states that ""none of the funds appropriated under this subchapter shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning."" This has been the rule since the program began.

If a clinic that receives Title X funding also performs abortions, it must make sure none of that federal money goes to those services.

For instance, if women getting abortions share a waiting room with those who receive federally funded family planning services, the clinic can't bill the government for the entire cost of running the waiting room. It must subtract the proportion that goes to pay for patients waiting for abortion services.

Whether the 1993 bill was anti-abortion is debatable, said Mary Harned, staff counsel for Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion group.

That year, President Bill Clinton issued an executive order rescinding what was called the ""gag rule,"" which prohibited clinics from discussing the option of abortion with patients. This bill would have made it more difficult for a subsequent administration to reinstate the rule.

Deal received 90 percent and 94 percent ratings from the anti-abortion group National Right to Life during the latter half of the 1990s, which means he supported its agenda almost all the time. 
It's likely that Deal would not have voted for a similar bill later in his career in Congress, a campaign spokesman said. He has since come to believe that if the federal government provides any funding for Planned Parenthood, it frees up their funds for pro-abortion efforts.

During his last two terms in Congress, Deal received 100 percent ratings from National Right to Life.

Erickson's claim crumbles in the face of the facts.

The Family Planning Amendments Act of 1993 didn't fund anything. What it would have done was re-authorize a federal family planning program that is explicitly barred from funding abortions. Funding for actual abortions was never up for debate, and the bill never passed.

Jeff Greene attacks Kendrick Meek for cigar ties
","
Congressman Kendrick Meek relishes a good cigar -- Padrons are his favorite, he told Cigar Aficionado magazine in a 2008 profile. He hosts an annual cigar party and is known to hand out cigars to members of Congress and their staff, and the cigar industry has helped fund his recent campaigns, the magazine reported. Padron Cigars, a longtime family business, is headquartered in Little Havana in Miami.

Meek's U.S. Senate Democratic primary opponent, Jeff Greene, attacks Meek for his ties to the tobacco industry in a campaign flier accusing Meek of standing with special interests.

Specifically, Greene wrote in a campaign flier that hit mailboxes around July 23, 2010, that Meek was ""#1 in Florida in taking tobacco cash and then opposed a tax on cigars that would have helped pay for children's health care."" Greene this week introduced a new TV ad that stated ""Meek lobbied for big tobacco against children's health care.""

We decided to examine the campaign flier. Did Meek rake in more money from the tobacco industry than anyone else in Florida and then oppose a tax on cigars that would pay for children's health care?

Greene's campaign cited the Center for Responsive Politics -- an organization that analyzes campaign donations -- as part of its proof, so we turned there first to check tobacco donations for Meek's 2008 Congressional race and 2010 U.S. Senate race. The website shows that Meek received $77,325 from the tobacco industry in his 2010 race and $63,727 in his 2008 race. Those amounts put him at No. 1 among Florida candidates for House or Senate and Florida members of the House and Senate.

But Greene's flier said Meek was ""#1 in Florida"" and did not specify whether that was only among federal candidates. There is no simple way to thoroughly check tobacco donations to all candidates across Florida including for state Legislature.

Next we checked Meek’s voting record on the U.S. Library of Congress website, particularly in 2007 and 2009, on bills that would raise taxes on the tobacco industry to help pay for children's health care. Meek voted for the bill each time – but the background is more complex. 
While Meek touted the law, behind the scenes he helped Miami cigar maker Jorge Padron get a meeting with top Democrats including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi so Padron could lobby against higher taxes, the Miami Herald wrote on March 24, 2008. Padron later hosted a fundraiser for Meek.

The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 would have increased excise tax rates on cigars, cigarettes, cigarette papers and tubes, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco. Meek voted for the bill, referred to as the Small Business Tax Relief Act in the House, on Feb. 16, 2007. President George W. Bush vetoed the bill. Meek voted again for the bill on Oct. 25, 2007, and again Bush vetoed it.

The taxes on cigars would have soared from 5 cents to $3, a 6,000 percent increase, the Miami Herald wrote. That tax hike was too high, Meek said in the 2008 article, but he also supported the health care legislation by voting for it.

The Miami Herald wrote, ""Asked why he would take a seemingly contrary stance by voting twice for the legislation, Meek explained that expanding healthcare was vital, adding, 'We knew it was going to be vetoed. ... My advocacy on behalf of the legislation is well documented in the congressional record. At the same time, I am sensitive to the fact that business owners facing a giant tax increase want to make sure that legislative leaders understand exactly what is going on. [The insurance program] is going to pass one day with my vote, but [I] don't want the small businesses in Florida and in my community run out of business.'""

Meek also explained his concerns in the Cigar Aficionado magazine profile.

""The goal of government is not to put small businesses out of business,"" Meek told Cigar Aficionado. ""Speaker Pelosi and Chairman (Charles) Rangel are not about putting small businesses out of business. I thought that the tax increase (from 20.7 to nearly 53 percent) on the handmade cigar industry went a little bit too far. Well, not a little bit too far; it went too far. This would have hurt not only a lot of businesses in South Florida, but also those countries where the tobacco comes from. The Dominican Republic would have felt a direct effect of such a large tax [increase]. Also Honduras. Also Nicaragua.""

In 2009, the children’s health care legislation came up again, this time to raise the federal excise tax on cigarettes 61 cents, from 39 cents a pack to $1.01 a pack, and raise taxes on other tobacco products. Meek voted in favor of the bill, along with nearly every Democrat in the house, according to a Jan. 14, 2009, press release from Meek. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law in February 2009.

Cigar makers credited Meek with helping reduce the amount of the tax on cigar manufacturers, according to a Jan. 15, 2009, Tampa Tribune article. The article quoted Eric Newman, president of the Cigar Manufacturers Association of Tampa, as saying Tampa Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor ""and Meek were very helpful and supportive of our positions."" 
So where does that leave us?

Meek was clearly No. 1 in tobacco donations among Florida candidates for House or Senate in his 2008 race and 2010 race and is at the top among Florida's members in the House and Senate. But Greene's flier didn't specify that the No. 1 label applied only to federal races and there is no simple way to check the tobacco dollars given to candidates across the state for various offices.

Greene also claimed that Meek ""opposed"" a tax on cigars that would have paid for children's health care. Meek thought that the 2007 version was too high of an increase for businesses and he scored key meetings for a cigar maker with member of Congress, but he voted for the legislation anyway -- twice that year. Meek again voted for the version that passed in 2009 when the cigar industry credited him with helping reduce the amount of their tax burden. We recognize he worked to lower the amount of the tax, but we think it's misleading to say that Meek ""opposed"" a tax when he voted for it three times. Politicians are ultimately judged on their votes, and that's why Meek’s votes for the legislation is crucial information here. We considered both parts of Greene's claim and rate it Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968A6100>],/factchecks/2010/jul/27/jeff-greene/greene-attacks-meek-cigar-ties/

Chafee says Schilling teammate thought he faked bloody sock
","
Call it New England Politics 101. When you're running for office in Red Sox Nation, you don't take a Red Sox player's name in vain. Especially not the one who shed blood as he helped end that soul-crushing 86-year drought.

But that's exactly what independent gubernatorial candidate Lincoln Chafee did in speaking about former Red Sox ace Curt Schilling in an interview on WPRO's The John DePetro show Tuesday.

""I just remember his own teammates didn't like him,"" Chafee said of Schilling. ""They thought he was a bit of a salesman. I remember one of his teammates said he painted his sock, the bloody sock, that he painted it. Kevin Millar I think said that. I don't know if I trust Curt Schilling.""

He was talking about the larger issue of Schilling's role in a controversial state economic development deal that will give Schilling's video game company, 38 Studios, a $75-million loan guarantee if he moves it to Rhode Island from Massachusetts. Chafee criticized the Schilling agreement for encumbering more than half of a new state loan guarantee program and risking it ""on one company that's never had a penny of revenue yet.""

But what many will remember is that Chafee criticized the guy who got the Sox a win when they needed it most: Game 6 of the 2004 playoff series against the Yankees. Not to mention he maligned the sock that has since been enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Put it up there with failed Massachusetts Senate candidate Martha Coakley, who famously referred to Schilling as a Yankee fan and poked fun at her opponent, Scott Brown, for standing outside Fenway Park shaking hands.

Diehard fans never forgave her. And Scott Brown is now Senator Brown.

The Chafee camp was quick to retract the talk radio comment, sending The Providence Journal this statement by late morning: ""Senator Chafee regrets that what he intended as an off-hand reference to published reports about the bloody sock has deflected attention from the crux of this issue.""

He went on to say: ""Senator Chafee respects Curt Schilling's achievements as a professional athlete and his support of charitable causes.  At the end of the day, however, his first concern is to protect the interest of Rhode Island taxpayers, on whose shoulders the burden of a 75 million dollar loan default would ultimately fall.""

We here at PolitiFact don't typically check one-time shots from the hip, so we considered ignoring this flap. But by Tuesday afternoon, as the Chafee gaffe made national news and readers urged us to jump on it, we decided to take at look at the rumor that's been swirling for years.

It appears by all credible accounts that Chafee is, in fact, wrong.

The story begins with an ankle injury Schilling suffered in a playoff series against the Angels. Team doctors temporarily fixed a ruptured and dislocated tendon in his right ankle to keep it from moving, allowing him to pitch in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series against the Yankees.   

Here's what The Providence Journal story about that October 2004 game said:  ""Schilling, who apparently was bleeding through his sock, was pitching through discomfort. TV cameras caught him wincing as he followed the flight of Miguel Cairo's two-out double to left-center in the third inning, the first Yankee hit of the game.""

Ah yes, it's coming back now, chills and all. You know the ending. Schilling kept pitching, helping  to vault the Sox past the Yankees to capture the American League title and then win the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals.

Fast forward three years. The rumor that the blood on the sock was in fact red paint seems to have been started in 2007 by Baltimore Orioles TV announcer Gary Thorne, who said on air that Boston's then-backup catcher Doug Mirabelli told him it was a hoax. (That's Mirabelli, not Kevin Millar, as Chafee cited). Thorne later apologized, saying that Mirabelli told him in a later conversation that he was just joking.

After much buzz on blogs and television, the report ended there. It's been brought up again from time to time, but never with much traction.

We emailed Schilling Tuesday to get his reaction to the accusation, but we never heard back.

For now, all indications are that the blood was real and that Chafee is wrong, a fact that he admits and apologizes for. 
In a follow-up phone call Tuesday night, a Chafee campaign spokesman said it best: ""Some candidates shoot themselves in the foot. We shot ourselves in the sock."" 
The Truth-O-Meter gives Chafee a false, and scores him a big error in the public relations department.

Marc Morial correct on unemployment rates for whites, blacks, Latinos
","
On July 25, 2010, David Gregory, the host of NBC's Meet the Press, asked his roundtable panelists to consider ""Diversity and the Myth of White Privilege,"" a Wall Street Journal op-ed column from July 22, in which Sen. James Webb, D-Va., argues against federal affirmative action laws.

""I have dedicated my political career to bringing fairness to America's economic system and to our work force, regardless of what people look like or where they may worship,"" Webb wrote. ""Unfortunately, present-day diversity programs work against that notion, having expanded so far beyond their original purpose that they now favor anyone who does not happen to be white. In an odd historical twist that all Americans see but few can understand, many programs allow recently arrived immigrants to move ahead of similarly situated whites whose families have been in the country for generations. These programs have damaged racial harmony. And the more they have grown, the less they have actually helped African-Americans, the intended beneficiaries of affirmative action as it was originally conceived.""

Marc Morial -- president of the National Urban League, a century-old civil rights organization -- was one panelist who took the challenge, arguing that non-whites continue to experience disadvantages compared to whites.

""I don't agree that Latinos and Asians have not suffered discrimination in this country or that Native Americans have not suffered discrimination in this country,"" Morial said. ""I think the question is, how do you target and tailor policies that are going to help all economically and socially disadvantaged people. And it's a fair debate to have, but it also needs to be positive with facts. Look at the Latino unemployment rate. It's higher than the white rate. The black rate is higher than the Latino rate. So to suggest that there are not disparities that affect the Latino community, that affect the Native American community, most in depth, the African-American community, we've got to have the discussion that Jim Webb wants to have. We have facts, real facts, that give a picture of how life is in this nation.""

We won't take sides on Webb's proposal to end policies that provide race-based advantages, a topic that inspires passions on both sides, but which isn't a checkable fact. Instead, we'll focus on the narrower question of whether Morial is accurate on the question of comparative unemployment rates for whites, blacks and Latinos.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates seasonally adjusted unemployment rates by race and ethnicity. We found that in June 2010, the white unemployment rate was 8.6 percent. The black unemployment rate was 15.4 percent, and the Hispanic/Latino rate was 12.4.

So Morial is correct that the Latino unemployment rate is higher than the white rate and that the black rate is higher than the Latino rate.

Though it falls beyond the boundaries of our fact-check, we'll note one other point from the statistics. Morial argued that Latinos and Asian Americans have suffered discrimination in the United States, and we think most people would agree with that at least as a historical matter. But if you look at the unemployment rate for Asians, it's 7.7 percent. That's actually lower than the rate for whites.

"['National', 'Small Business', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Taxes', 'Stephen Hayes']","
So-called wealthy are actually small business owners? The data is dubious
","
Across-the-board tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush are set to expire at the end of the year, stoking the political debate over tax policy.

President Barack Obama campaigned on the position that lower tax rates should only be extended for single people who make less than $200,000 a year, or couples who make less than $250,000. Republicans, on the other hand, want the lower tax rates to stay in place for everyone.

One of the arguments Republicans use to support tax cuts for the wealthy is that most are small business owners. Conservative pundit Stephen Hayes made the case on ABC News' This Week, after U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner affirmed the Obama administration's commitment to raising taxes on high earners.

""The people that we're talking about, these so-called wealthy, most of them are small-business owners,"" Hayes said. ""So if you're talking about cutting taxes for people who can put people back to work, that's who you're talking about.""

It's certainly more politically palatable to urge lower taxes for mom-and-pop business owners  than for Wall Street fat cats. But is it true that most of the rich are small business owners?

We fact-checked similar claims during the 2008 election, so we're familiar with the sources that both sides use to argue this point.

The basis for Hayes' claim comes from details gleaned from Internal Revenue Service data. The U.S. Treasury Department found in 2007 that many of the wealthiest tax filers report some type of non-wage income, such as income from a sole proprietorship, a partnership or an S corporation. (An S corporation is simply a corporation that chooses to pass corporate income, losses, deductions and credit through to their shareholders for federal tax purposes.) The Treasury Department estimated that 75 percent of tax payers in the top bracket reported this type of income.

Does this mean that all those wealthy taxpayers were small business owners? Probably not. This kind of income could be reported from anyone who earned money from a source other than a regular job, such as consulting or public speaking. It could also be reported by those who make most of their income from partnerships, such as law firms and medical practices. And it could include investors who have little involvement in the day-to-day operations of a company.

It's impossible to know how many of these high earners are what most people think of as small business owners. One indication, however, might be if these wealthy taxpayers reported that most of their income was from this business-type income. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center analyzed IRS data in March 2009, looking to see how many wealthy tax filers could say that half of their income or more came from business income. The center found that, among the wealthiest filers -- the top 1 percent -- only 25 percent earned more than half their income from business-type income. The percentages for non-wage income were even smaller among taxpayers earning less. (Editor's note: After we initially published this item, the Tax Policy Center released a new analysis looking at business income by tax bracket. They found that in the top bracket, only 32.5 percent earned more than half their income that way.)

Hayes defended his statement in an e-mail to PolitiFact. While he conceded that not every tax filer who reports business income is a small business owner, he said he found the 50 percent cut-off for defining owners arbitrary.

""I can see not counting as a 'small business owner' someone who makes $500,000 in from an employer and $2,000 in small business income. And if we included all of those people the number would be comfortably above 'most' among the top earners. So reasonable people can disagree about where to draw that line. But it seems odd that we would not count as a 'small business owner' someone who owns a small business that generates 49 percent of her overall income,"" he said.

There's one final point we want to clarify here for our readers, because we've been asked about this before: If you are a small business owner yourself, you would have to be a whiz running a very profitable small business to get hit with a tax increase under the plan Obama supports. You would have to report total income of more than $200,000 (or $250,000 for couples) after all your business expenses were deducted. You may remember this being a key point during the Joe the Plumber debate during the 2008 campaign when Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher said to then candidate Obama, ""I'm getting ready to buy a company that makes 250 to 280 thousand dollars a year. Your new tax plan's going to tax me more, isn't it?"" Back then, the Tax Policy Center analyzed all taxpayers, of any income level, who report these types of business income. They found only about 2 percent of them would see tax increases if the government increased the rates on the top earners. So the vast majority of possible small business owners would not see a tax increase if the Bush tax cuts expire for those in the top incomes.

In conclusion, do many wealthy tax payers report types of business income that might be from owning a small business? Sure. But it's impossible to tell how many meet the definition of what most of us think of when we think of small business owners. Other data indicate that among all tax payers who might be small business owners, most would not see taxes go up if the Bush tax cuts for the highest earners are allowed to expire. Hayes said that ""these so-called wealthy, most of them are small-business owners."" We rate that statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A38F5C0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/27/stephen-hayes/so-called-wealthy-are-actually-small-business-owne/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Stimulus', 'Jeanne Shaheen']","
Lawmaker claims unemployment benefits boost economic growth
","
Extending aid to the unemployed is not only the ""right"" thing to do, it is also one of the best ways to stimulate economic growth. That, at least, is what has become a frequent talking point, especially among Democratic lawmakers.

New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen reiterated the argument during a recent MSNBC interview. ""This is one of the best things we can do to help stimulate the economy, because for every dollar we put in unemployment, it pays back about $1.60. And we know that people who are on unemployment are going to go out, and they're going to spend that money, they're going to pay for groceries at their local grocery store, they're going to buy gas in their car.""

Using a dollar to make $1.60 sounds like a dream come true, so we decided to look into it.

Shaheen's office told us that the number comes from Mark Zandi, the chief economist for Moody's Economy.com and a former adviser to John McCain during the 2008 presidential campaign.

During testimony before the Senate Finance Committee on April 14, 2010, Zandi called on lawmakers to provide emergency benefits to individuals who have lost their jobs. ""No form of the fiscal stimulus has proved more effective during the past two years than emergency UI benefits,"" Zandi said, using the abbreviation for unemployment insurance. Specifically, he calculated that for every dollar spent in benefits, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grows by $1.61 one year later.

Next, we looked at a report issued in January 2010 by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the official nonpartisan number-cruncher for Congress. In its discussion of increasing unemployment aid, the report noted that the proposal is ""both timely and cost-effective in spurring economic activity and employment."" For every dollar spent, the CBO wrote, the GDP would increase by anywhere from $0.70 to $1.90 per year from 2010 to 2015.

What accounts for such a large variation? Till von Wachter, an associate professof of economics at Columbia University, told us that this sort of a range ""is typical in this kind of empirical analysis."" He said that one possible reason is ""because different estimation methods or specifications give slightly different results."" David Card from the University of California-Berkeley added that the uncertainty ""presumably illustrates the sad state of knowledge in the field.""

So, Shaheen is right on target if we go by Zandi's numbers, but she picked a number that's in the upper range of CBO's estimated range. Still, there is more to the story.

For one, there is considerable question among academics about the accuracy of the unemployment benefits' ""multiplier effects."" Robert Barro, a Harvard economist, pointed out that before spending on unemployment benefits goes up, the GDP goes down, which makes it difficult to come up with a ""serious estimate"" of the impact of unemployment benefits. Lawrence Katz, also from Harvard, said that he has ""many qualms with these standard macro forecasting models."" Still, Katz also pointed out that the current models are ""the best we have right now to make such forecasts."" Alan Reynolds, an economist from the libertarian-leaning CATO Institute, wrote in a January 29, 2010 blog post that Zandi's econometric model relies on assumptions that are contradicted by contemporary academic research. 

There are also some researchers who maintain that not only does increased spending on unemployment provides minimal economic boost, but also that it may decrease output in the long run, in part because the government will have to recoup money paid out in benefits through increased taxes. In a November 2008 report, scholars Karen Campbell and James Sherk from the conservative Heritage Foundation argue that existing studies on the subject are flawed, because they do not take into account that unemployment insurance reduces workers' incentives to work. The pro-benefits studies also assume that every dollar of spending funds new consumption, they said. Many studies since the 1970s ""have concluded that unemployment insurance plays at best a small role in stabilizing the economy,"" the report argued. Campbell added, however, that though she does not believe that economic stimulus is a good argument for extending benefits, welfare arguments could be made for doing so.

To recap: Sen. Shaheen said that ""for every dollar we put in unemployment it, pays back about $1.60."" The CBO said that the increase is actually anywhere from $.70 to $1.90, so she picked a number that's on the high end of that estimate. She's right on target if we go by Mark Zandi's economic study, but many of the scholars we spoke with are critical of attempts to accurately estimate the effect that spending on unemployment insurance has on the GDP. We rate this Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C157140>],/factchecks/2010/jul/27/jeanne-shaheen/lawmaker-claims-unemployment-benefits-boost-econom/

Geithner claims U.S. had six months of positive job growth in the private sector
","
During the July 25, 2010 segment of ABC's This Week, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner defended President Barack Obama's economic track record. He specifically brought up the successes that the administration has had in boosting activity in the private sector.

""But right now, the best thing the government can do...is help create the conditions for the private sector to start to invest in hiring again. Now, we've seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector. That's pretty good.""

We don't have the expertise to evaluate what constitutes ""pretty good"" job growth, but we can check the claim that the growth has been positive for the last six months.

We visited the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, one of our favorite federal number crunchers. On July 2, 2010, the bureau released its monthly Current Employment Statistics Highlights report. On page five, the report contains statistics on seasonally adjusted private sector employment going back to January 2000. Geithner specifically referenced the last six months of the current year, so that's where we focused our attention.

In December 2009, the private sector shed 83,000 jobs. That was significantly smaller than the average drop for the year, since the private-sector employment losses averaged 388,000 per month during 2009, according to the report. And so we come to 2010. How have we fared for the past six months? Here's a quick monthly summary of jobs added:

January: 16,000
February: 62,000
March: 158,000
April: 241,000
May: 33,000
June: 83,000

Data for the month of July --which wasn't over when Geithner spoke -- won't be released until August, so that's the most up-to-date data available. The report notes that data for the two most recent months are preliminary. But unless there's an unusually big after-the fact correction for either month, it's pretty clear that Geithner was correct. We've seen positive job growth in the private sector from January to June. We rate this True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2B2780>],/factchecks/2010/jul/27/timothy-geithner/geithner-claims-us-had-six-months-positive-job-gro/

Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland says the state’s electricity rates are 10 percent below national average
","
Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland seems determined to be regarded as your energy governor. In his race for re-election this November, the governor touts his efforts toward energy reform at almost every opportunity.

He was at it again during a campaign address on July 6 when he said, ""The energy reform bill I proposed gave Ohio one of the nation’s most aggressive renewable energy policies and has pushed our utilities to innovate.

""And while other states that failed to act saw electricity rates jump 70 percent,"" Strickland said, ""Ohio’s electricity rates are 10 percent below the national average.""

Strickland’s spokeswoman, Allison Kolodziej, acknowledges that Ohio’s electricity rates were already well below the national average before Strickland took office in January 2007. But she said the governor’s push for Senate Bill 221 — which became law in 2008 and placed tighter reins on utility companies seeking to set market-based pricing — prevented Ohio’s rates from skyrocketing as rates did in other states where wholesale market pricing was unchecked.

The question: Are Ohio’s rates today a full 10 percent below the national average as the governor claimed? The governor’s campaign staff said it relied on information from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration, or EIA, for its figures.

According to EIA’s most recent average retail price report, released June 16 and updated through March, Ohio’s average electricity price for all sectors this year was 8.72 cents per kilowatt hour. The national average was 9.5 cents. That means Ohio’s rate thus for 2010 for all sectors is about 8 percent below the national average — not 10 percent.

In 2009, however — the last full year of available figures — Ohio’s average was 8.63 cents per kilowatt hour and the national average 9.75 cents, meaning a year ago the state was 11 percent below the national average. That means Strickland’s statement is not accurate today but was a year ago.

Kolodziej said the campaign is relying on 2009 figures because the full 2010 year figures are not yet complete.

The premise of Strickland’s statement is that Ohio is still trending below the national average when it comes to electricity rates, and thus is better off than many other states in terms of utility costs. The context of his point was accurate.

But while the full 2010 figures are not yet available, there were more up to date figures the governor could have relied on during his speech that, while not as flattering as 2009, could have still effectively made his point — just more accurately.

We rate this statement as Mostly True.

"['Georgia', 'Voting Record', 'Austin Scott']","
Congressman ""votes liberal,"" opponent says
","

Austin Scott has issued some fightin' words to his opponent, U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall (D-Ga.), in the race for Georgia's 8th Congressional District.

Scott, a Republican, told supporters in an e-mail that Marshall ""votes liberal ... and we aren't fooled.""

""It's one of the worst things you can say about a candidate in Georgia,"" said University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock.

Particularly in the central part of the state, where Marshall has won races by razor-thin margins. In 2006, for example, Marshall won by 1 percent of all ballots cast. Bullock expects another close race this year that could help shape the balance of power between Democrats and Republicans in Congress.

""It should be our most interesting race in Georgia,"" Bullock said.

The 8th District runs along a stretch of I-75 in Middle Georgia that includes Macon, Warner Robins, Dublin and Tifton. Republicans want this seat. Badly. In 2004, Vice President Dick Cheney came to Georgia to help raise money for Marshall's opponent, Calder Clay. Two years later, President George W. Bush made a campaign stop in the area to aid Marshall's opponent, Mac Collins. It's often one of the most contested congressional seats in the nation.

Marshall, first voted into office in 2002, has been able to hold on to the seat with a coalition of moderate white voters and strong support among black voters, who make up about 30 percent of the district's registered voters, Bullock said. Republicans are eager to take control of Congress, believing they can seize upon voter anger about the economy, immigration and health care legislation. Marshall, a four-term congressman, voted against the federal health care legislation earlier this year. He supported giving the Bush administration authority to invade Iraq. Marshall describes himself on his congressional Web site as one of the ""few centrists in Congress.""

Scott told PolitiFact Georgia he's right in calling out Marshall's voting record. Scott said Marshall ""repeatedly voted for San Francisco liberal"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and voted for bailouts for Wall Street.

""In Middle Georgia, that's what we call liberal,"" Scott said in an e-mail.

Marshall voted in October 2008 for the $700 billion financial bailout plan, but he voted against a bailout plan for the auto industry in December 2008 and a $410 billion spending plan in February. The House of Representatives elected Pelosi its speaker at the beginning of 2007 and 2009 in what are largely procedural votes along party lines. Marshall voted for Pelosi, along with fellow Democrats, said his spokesman, Douglas Moore.

So does Marshall vote liberal?

""Only if you are looking at it from the far right,"" Bullock said.

In 2009, Marshall was the 250th-most-liberal member out of the 431 House of Representatives members rated by the National Journal, which compiles an annual ranking of Congress. The rankings are based on House members' voting histories. He was the fifth-most-conservative House Democrat last year, the Journal concluded. In 2008, Marshall was the 234th-most-liberal member of the 428 House members it rated that year, the Journal found. He was the second-most-conservative Democrat that year, the Journal concluded. In 2007, Marshall was rated by the National Journal as the most conservative voting Democrat in the House.

Marshall voted with Democratic colleagues about 89 percent of the time during the current Congress, according to a Washington Post analysis. That is slightly below the 92.3 percent average of most Democrats, according to the Post. Using his voting record, the Web site On the Issues rated Marshall as a ""conservative-leaning populist."" Two groups well-regarded by conservatives, the National Rifle Association and the Family Research Council, gave Marshall high marks based on his voting record. Some left-leaning groups have also given Marshall high marks for his positions on issues important to them. The NAACP last year gave Marshall an 80 rating on a scale of 100, according to Project Vote Smart. The AFL-CIO gave him a 71 score on a scale of 100, Project Vote Smart said.

""[Marshall] has one of the most conservative Democratic voting records in Congress,"" Bullock said. ""But most Republicans are further right. Would Austin Scott be more conservative than Jim Marshall? Absolutely!""

Tom Crawford, who has covered Georgia politics for more than three decades, disagreed. Crawford said on his Georgia Report blog that Marshall is ""more conservative than Scott on some issues.""

Bullock believes the key for Scott will be whether he can convince voters the Marshall is a liberal. The professor remembers when Republicans labeled Democrat Zell Miller, a former U.S. senator and Georgia governor, a liberal. Miller, you may remember, endorsed George W. Bush for president in 2004 and gave the keynote address at that year's Republican National Convention.

So back to the question as to whether Marshall votes liberal?

Marshall is largely rated in the middle by most political observers, based on his voting record. Some conservatives believe he's too far to the left. So where does that leave Marshall? We believe in the middle. The independent research shows Marshall votes more ""conservative"" than nearly every Democrat but more ""liberal"" than nearly every Republican. Therefore, we rate Scott's claim about Marshall as Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2BE680>],/factchecks/2010/jul/27/austin-scott/congressman-votes-liberal-opponent-says/
"['Education', 'Texas', 'Leticia Van de Putte']","
Leticia Van de Putte says Bill White's efforts to cut dropout rate replicated by almost every Texas city
","
State Sen. Leticia Van de Putte praised gubernatorial candidate Bill White, a fellow Democrat, for his efforts to get dropouts back into classrooms during a speech last month to her party's convention in Corpus Christi. 
He ""went door to door in Houston luring and asking those dropouts to come back to school,"" she said June 25. ""Those programs were so successful that almost every city in our state has replicated what Bill White started."" 
We wondered whether the former mayor of Houston's education initiative had really become so widespread. 
In response to our inquiry, Van de Putte's office pointed us to the website for Expectation Graduation, a program that White and his wife, Andrea, helped create in 2004 -- his first year as Houston mayor -- to reduce dropout rates. Part of the program's strategy is an annual Reach Out to Dropouts walk during which volunteers visit the homes of students who have not come back to school and encourage them to return. 
Linda Clarke, who served as White's director of education and special projects when he was mayor, said one goal of the walk is to help kids deal with the issues that keep them out of school, such as finding child care for teen mothers. 
The first walk was held in the Houston school district in 2004, and Clarke said Bill White has participated in each one. Mark Cueva, assistant to the deputy chief of staff in the office of Houston Mayor Annise Parker, said the walks first went statewide in 2008, when other major cities in Texas -- excluding Austin -- and their respective school districts held their own versions: Corpus Christi, Dallas, El Paso, Fort Worth and San Antonio. 
Five small cities in the Houston area also participated: Baytown, Galena Park, Richmond, Rosenberg, and Stafford. Last year, Midland joined the group, as did eight additional small cities near Houston. That brings the total number of Texas cities to 20. 
According to the Texas Almanac online, which is maintained by the Texas State Historical Association, the state has about 1,200 incorporated cities. So, less than 2 percent of the state's cities are replicators of the White-founded outreach program. 
On Tuesday, the White campaign released a Web video highlighting White's involvement with the Reach Out to Dropouts walk and its spread to big cities across the state. The campaign video also says that the Reach Out to Dropouts walk has brought more than 8,000 students back to school in Houston. Clarke said that number is a cumulative total based on reports by participating Houston-area school districts. 
When we asked Clarke, who is on the board of the nonprofit group that runs Expectation Graduation, about Van de Putte's statement that ""almost every city in our state"" has replicated the Reach Out program, she questioned the broad sweep of that assertion, and said her organization has always been clear about the number of cities participating. 
Van de Putte's press secretary, Kathryn Freeman, told us that the senator had gone off her prepared remarks during that part of the speech, which ""simply stated that the program was so successful it was replicated across Texas."" However, based on the expansion of the walk in the past two years, Freeman argued that the senator's ""larger point is true, that Bill White began a program to try and address the dropout crisis in Houston that was successful and therefore replicated."" 
We agree. Although Van de Putte clearly overstated the expansion of the Reach Out to Dropouts walk, it has been duplicated in most of the biggest cities in the state. We rate her claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2CF7C0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/27/leticia-van-de-putte/leticia-van-de-putte-says-bill-whites-efforts-cut-/

Rick Scott touts ""7-7-7"" plan to create 700,000 jobs in seven years
","
Rick Scott, a Republican running for governor, is scurrying across Florida touting a new economic plan to create 700,000 jobs in seven years.

The plan relies heavily on cutting government spending, eliminating state regulation, reducing property taxes for homeowners and phasing out the state's business income tax. (See it here.)

""I am the only candidate in this race with a comprehensive plan that will get our fiscal house in order, balance the budget and create long-term, good-paying jobs,"" Scott says introducing the plan, which is sometimes called the ""7-7-7"" plan. ""My 7-step plan isn't complex. In fact, it's very simple. And it's common sense.

""I've created jobs in the private sector. As governor, my 7-step plan will create 700,000 in 7 years.""

PolitiFact Florida steers clear of trying to fact-check opinions -- so we won't in this item analyze Scott's claim that he is the only candidate running for governor with a comprehensive fiscal plan. Scott's primary opponent, Bill McCollum, does have an economic plan, for the record, and so does Democrat Alex Sink.

We also avoid checking things in the future we can't know -- so no weighing in on Scott's 700,000 jobs promise.

But we can get our fact-checking hands around a more basic question: Does Scott's plan -- however it was crafted and however logical or illogical it may be -- actually call for the creation of 700,000 jobs in seven years?

It's a point worth knowing, particularly when McCollum says his plan will add 500,000 jobs, or 200,000 less than Scott. (To be fair, we plan to look at McCollum's numbers in a subsequent report).

The glossy printed version of the plan that's displayed on Scott's campaign website and has been handed out across the state breaks down job growth by: if the state adopts Scott's regulatory reforms; if the state phases out the income tax on businesses; and if the state better focuses on job growth and retention. Let's take one at a time.

Regulatory reform

Scott's plan includes a freeze on new regulation, a promise to expedite permits for job-creating businesses, working to move Florida's health insurance costs in line with the national average, and somehow shaving electricity costs by $3.25 billion. Reducing those barriers will create 240,000 new jobs, Scott says.

Phasing out corporate income tax

Scott says eliminating the corporate income tax ""will have a minimal effect on state revenues."" But the state collected almost $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2009-2010 through the corporate tax, which was about 2.7 percent of the $66.5 billion state budget in 2009-2010. Combined with other tax and spending reforms, Scott says the elimination of the corporate income tax will create 365,000 new jobs.

Focusing on job growth and retention

Scott's plan is to invest in a state Innovation Fund to help attract high-tech businesses. He also says he'll take a more hands-on role in bringing new business to Florida. The result? Another 60,000 jobs.

That's 240,000 regulatory reform new jobs + 365,000 tax and budget cut new jobs + 60,000 new jobs through state incentives and a persistent new governor = 665,000 jobs.

A group of reporters, including the Palm Beach Post's Mike Bender, asked Scott about the discrepancy on July 25, 2010, as Scott was in the middle of a six-day statewide bus tour.

""It's just rounding,"" Scott said. Bender reported that a more detailed version of the plan puts the jobs number lower, at 661,914.

Donna Arduin, who helped draft the economic plan and is Jeb Bush's former budget director, noted to reporters that the job growth estimates are conservative.

Still, the number is the number.

And it doesn't add up to 700,000.

At the same time, it's worth noting that Scott's budget cutting plan also calls for a 5 percent reduction in the state workforce. Using the Florida Department of Management Services most recent workforce report, that would mean anywhere from 5,473 to 8,432 state workers would lose their jobs (depending on how across-the-board the 5 percent cut is). 
Scott campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said Scott's plan only measures private sector growth. 
Still, we believe it's appropriate to at least mention the impact on public jobs under Scott's plan.  
If you include the public sector losses, that could put the net job creation figure somewhere around 656,441 (using the low end estimate of 5,473 state workers being let go). That means Scott's claim is inflated by about 6.6 percent, or 43,559 jobs. That's more than all of the people employed in Hernando County, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Or it's equivalent to closing just about every dentist office in the state.

Scott claims that his economic plan for Florida will create 700,000 jobs in seven years, but he admits that he's rounding up. The real number in the plan is closer to 660,000 jobs. We guess the ""7-7-7"" plan sounds better than ""7-6.6-7"" plan, but for the sake of accuracy, we have to rate Scott's claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B37AC0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/26/rick-scott/rick-scott-touts-7-7-7-plan-create-700000-jobs-sev/

Fox News handling Sherrod story defended by 'Weekly Standard's' Stephen Hayes
","
Washington and the nation were captivated a week ago by the controversy over Shirley Sherrod, a once-obscure U.S. Agriculture Department official who became a villain, and then a victim, over the course of 24 hours.

Because the story began and ended so quickly, we were unable to fact-check it at the time, but here's a recap of what happened.

Andrew Breitbart, a conservative provocateur, started things off July 19, 2010, when he posted a video on one of his websites, BigGovernment.com, that seemed to show Sherrod, who is black, telling an NAACP audience that she had discriminated against a white farmer. After conservative bloggers raised an outcry about Sherrod's apparent revelation, the NAACP moved to condemn Sherrod, and senior Agriculture Department officials quickly pressured Sherrod to resign.

But within hours, it came out that the video had been selectively edited, and the uncut version made clear that Sherrod had actually been telling the story about the white farmer to explain how she had overcome her own prejudices. She ended up helping save the family's farm, and the farmer and his wife took to the airwaves to defend Sherrod. The Agriculture Department then reversed itself, with Secretary Tom Vilsack making a heartfelt apology and asking Sherrod to return to the department. Sherrod also received a personal call from President Barack Obama.

This whirlwind of charges and counter-charges prompted a round of soul-searching by most of those involved in the episode, including those in government, advocacy groups, the blogosphere and the media. One question that quickly emerged was how culpable Fox News was. In the past, Fox news commentators have often beaten the drum on stories critical of Democrats, liberals and the Obama Administration, so to some who were sympathetic to Sherrod, Fox seemed like a plausible villain.

They took as evidence a July 20, 2010, CNN interview with Sherrod, in which she explained how, while driving through Georgia, she was forced out by Cheryl Cook, the deputy undersecretary.

When Cook called her cell phone, Sherrod recalled telling Cook, ""'Cheryl, I've got a three-and-a-half-hour ride to get into Athens.' She called me a second time, (saying,) 'Where are you now?' I said, 'I'm just going through Atlanta.' She called me again and I said, 'I'm at least 45 minutes to an hour from Athens. She said, 'Well, Shirley, they want you to pull over to the side of the road and do it (formally resign), because you're going to be on Glenn Beck tonight.'"" Beck, of course, is an outspoken conservative commentator with popular talk show on Fox.

The question of Fox's role came up during the July 25, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week. Host Jake Tapper cited a commentary by Josh Marshall of the liberal website Talking Points Memo. ""Breitbart got a piece of video he knew nothing about and published it with a central claim that he either made up or made no attempt to verify,"" Tapper quoted Marshall as writing. ""To use terminology of infectious disease, Fox was the primary vector of this story. And to the best of my knowledge, there's been not only no disciplining of anyone in the newsroom, but as far as I can see, no retraction, apology, or even discussion of their primary role in an obvious smear. This is a journalistic felony, really, the worst kind of thing that journalists can ever do, a reality only compounded by the fact that they refuse to admit not only culpability but even that they did anything wrong.""

For a reaction, Tapper turned to Stephen Hayes, a senior writer with the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, who was a member of the show's roundtable that week. ""Stephen, do you think that ... liberals are unfairly using this to try to discredit conservative journalists?""

Hayes responded, ""Yes, of course, they are. Look, the timeline doesn't work. I mean ... Howard Kurtz, at CNN and the Washington Post wrote that the timeline simply doesn't work. She actually resigned before or was forced to retire before anybody on Fox said a word about this.""

We thought it would be worthwhile to check the transcripts and see whether it's correct that Sherrod ""actually resigned before or was forced to retire before anybody on Fox said a word about this.""

The earliest on-air comment we could find came the toward the end of the 8 p.m. hour, during an airing of The O'Reilly Factor, a talk show hosted by pugnaciously conservative host Bill O'Reilly.

O'Reilly told viewers that ""speaking at an NAACP event in March, Department of Agriculture official Shirley Sherrod was caught on tape saying something very disturbing. Seems a white farmer in Georgia had requested government assistance from Ms. Sherrod."" He then showed a clip of Sherrod saying, ""I was struggling with the fact that so many black people had lost their farmland. And here I was faced with having to help a white person save their land. So I didn't give him the full force of what I could do.""

When the clip ended, O'Reilly said, ""Wow. Well, that is simply unacceptable. And Ms. Sherrod must resign immediately. The federal government cannot have skin color deciding any assistance. We are requesting an explanation from the agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, and will keep you posted. By the way, the full transcript of Ms. Sherrod's remarks is posted on BigGovernment.com.""

While it's safe to assume that O'Reilly was unaware of Sherrod's ouster at the time he aired those comments -- why would he call for her ouster if it had already happened? -- his producers apparently found out as the segment was underway, because as O'Reilly was speaking, Fox aired an on-screen notice that said, ""Sec. Vilsack has accepted Sherrod's resignation."" A few minutes later, during the 9 p.m. hour of Fox, O'Reilly's fellow conservative host, Sean Hannity, began his show with an alert that Sherrod had resigned.

So, based on the Fox transcripts as well as Sherrod's own account in the CNN interview, Hayes appears to be correct that Sherrod ""was forced to resign before anybody on Fox said a word about this."" Indeed, Howard Kurtz, the Washington Post's media critic, reported that ""after a news meeting Monday afternoon (July 19), an e-mail directive was sent to the news staff in which Fox Senior Vice President Michael Clemente said, 'Let's take our time and get the facts straight on this story. Can we get confirmation and comments from Sherrod before going on-air. Let's make sure we do this right.'""

But we think it's worth mentioning two additional points.

First, it's clear from O'Reilly's on-air comment that at least one Fox commentator was preparing to make hay over the Sherrod controversy before she resigned -- it's just that the Agriculture Department beat Fox to the punch by ousting her first. If officials above Sherrod had spent more time reviewing her case instead of forcing her to the side of the road, O'Reilly at least, and possibly other Fox hosts, were ready to take up the call for her to be ousted.

Second, Fox's television network may not have discussed Sherrod before she was ousted, but there's evidence that two of its web affiliates did mention the story.

Media Matters for America -- a liberal group that tracks alleged media bias and regularly spars with both Fox and Breitbart -- located a FoxNews.com story posted around noon on July 19 that began, ""Days after the NAACP clashed with Tea Party members over allegations of racism, a video has surfaced showing an Agriculture Department official regaling an NAACP audience with a story about how she withheld help to a white farmer facing bankruptcy."" Media Matters wrote that FoxNews.com credited BigGovernment.com with posting the video, and added that ""FoxNews.com is seeking a response from both the NAACP and the USDA."" While Media Matters said that the article is no longer available on FoxNews.com, it provided a screenshot.

Not long after that post went up at FoxNews.com, Media Matters said, Fox Nation -- an online community for news and commentary that's affiliated with Fox News -- posted the link to the Sherrod clip on BigGovernment.com under the headline, ""Caught on Tape: Obama Official Discriminates Against White Farmer.""

All told, it seems clear to us that the USDA ousted Sherrod in order to forestall the possibility that commentators on Fox's cable channel would start calling for her resignation, not because Fox commentators had actually begun to do so. Still, two Fox web affiliates mentioned the controversy before Sherrod's ouster, and the fact that O'Reilly called for her resignation without knowing that she was already out of a job suggests that Fox was already beginning to pounce. On balance, these two caveats persuade us to drop Hayes' otherwise accurate statement that Shirley Sherrod ""was forced to resign before anybody on Fox said a word about this"" by a notch to Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097833500>],/factchecks/2010/jul/26/stephen-hayes/stephen-hayes-defends-fox-handling-sherrod-story/

Jane Norton supported Referendum C -- so did the voters
","
It's not everyday a candidate personally appears in an ad to call her opponent gutless, but that's what Jane Norton did in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Colorado.

""Seen those TV ads attacking me? They're paid for by a shady interest group doing the bidding of Ken Buck,"" she said in reaction to the ad paid for by Americans for Job Security. ""You'd think Ken would be man enough to do it himself,"" Norton says in her own ad.

""Here's the truth: In state government, I cut budgets, cut programs and reduced staff,"" Norton continues. ""Ken Buck's Office? His spending skyrocketed by 40 percent. We need a senator who's actually cut spending, and has the backbone to stand her ground.""

The ""shady interest group"" Norton refers to is an outfit called Americans for Job Security. What they had to say about her wasn't so nice, either.

""Our country is at the brink,"" a narrator says. ""Colorado families and workers need relief -- yet Jane Norton supported the largest tax hike in Colorado history, costing us billions. And Jane Norton's record on government spending? The state bureaucracy she managed grew by $43 million in just three years. Record taxes and reckless spending has cost Colorado jobs. Call Jane Norton, tell her no more tax hikes and big government spending.""

Norton is a former lieutenant governor who got early backing from Republican Party leaders. Buck, on the other hand, is the Weld County District Attorney and a former U.S. attorney and has received backing from the tea party movement.

There are a lot of facts to sort through here. In this check, we're going to look at the tax increase charge against Norton. We'll examine Americans for Job Security's claim about an increasing bureaucracy in another report, and Norton's charges against Buck in still another report.

Americans for Job Security isn't a typical political action committee. It's organized as a business league 501(c)(6), which means its ads are limited to issue advocacy and that the group isn't required to publicly disclose its donors. The group's website says it favors ""free markets and pro-paycheck public policy,"" and it has a reputation for working against unions.

Still, it was fairly easy for us to reach the president of Americans for Job Security, Stephen DeMaura and ask him about the group's claims, specifically that Norton ""supported the largest tax hike in Colorado history, costing us billions."" He said the group has not coordinated with Buck and that Norton should address the ad's substance. ""Rather than wasting time with empty attack ads, she should respond to the claims and discuss them,"" DeMaura said. 
What Americans for Job Security calls the ""largest tax hike in Colorado history"" is actually subject to debate; some people contend it wasn't a tax increase at all. Let's start with a brief primer on Colorado tax history.

Our story begins in 1992, when Colorado voters approved a Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, popularly known as TABOR. The measure said the government can't spend tax money collected under existing tax rates if revenues grow faster than inflation and population. Instead, the government had to rebate that money to taxpayers. These rebates applied to many types of taxes and business fees, but it primarily affected income and sales taxes. TABOR also required any tax increases to be approved by voters.

By 2005, the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights had curtailed government spending to the point that some people felt basic services were being hurt, particularly for education. So voters were asked to approve Referendum C, allowing government to stop refunding excess revenues for the next five years. The measure drew bipartisan support from Colorado's elected leaders, including then Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican, as well as his lieutenant governor -- Jane Norton. Anti-tax groups vehemently opposed the measure, saying it was a betrayal of TABOR. But voters approved Referendum C with 52 percent of the vote.

Norton explained her support for the referendum in March 2010 to Fox 31 KDVR of Denver. ""Referendum C is actually the Taxpayers Bill of Rights in action,"" Norton said. ""TABOR allows for people to vote. And in this case, it was: do you want your tax refund to go -- it was a five-year time out -- and 52 percent of the people said yes, we will forgo our tax refund to help pay for essential services."" Her campaign also told Denver's ABC 7NEWS that the referendum was ""an unfortunate consequence of the worst recession in state history. Passing it meant the state did not have to close colleges, let prisoners out early, or cut services to the elderly.""

For our fact-check, we also wanted to determine whether Referendum C was actually the ""largest"" increase in tax revenues in Colorado history. We wondered, for example, if Referendum C was proportionally larger than Colorado's adoption of a 4 percent income tax in 1937.

We looked, but we couldn't find any analysis comparing the two measures. Natalie Mullis, chief economist for Colorado Legislative Council staff, which provides policy analysis for the Colorado Assembly, said she's gotten the same question from Colorado officials, but no definitive answer exists. She did say that Referendum C was the only significant increase in tax revenues since 1992, when TABOR passed.

The Americans for Job Security ad says in a graphic that Referendum C raised $6 billion. We asked Mullis about this; she said that the number was likely based on projections before the economic downturn started in 2008. The measure has actually generated about $3.7 billion, all of that in the three years right after the bill was passed. There were no extra revenues generated for 2009 and 2010, she said, due to the economic downturn.

Americans for Job Security said that ""Jane Norton supported the largest tax hike in Colorado history."" If the issue is just Referendum C, then yes, Norton supported it. But there are a number of qualifiers to that ""yes"": The evidence is not conclusive that it's the largest tax increase in Colorado history, though certainly it's the largest in recent years. Also, technically speaking, the measure didn't increase tax rates -- it ended rebates, though that does mean less money in people's pockets. Finally, Norton supported a ballot issue on which Colorado voters had the final say and ultimately approved. Given these facts, we rate this statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809731FCC0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/26/americans-job-security/jane-norton-supported-referendum-c-so-did-voters/

Jane Norton's Public Health and Environment Department had some funding increase, some funding decrease

An ad from a third-party group has Jane Norton blasting back and blaming her opponent in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Colorado.

""Seen those TV ads attacking me? They're paid for by a shady interest group doing the bidding of Ken Buck,"" she said in reaction to the ad paid for by Americans for Job Security. ""You'd think Ken would be man enough to do it himself."" Norton says in the ad.

The ""shady interest group"" Norton refers to is an outfit called Americans for Job Security. Here's their ad:

And Jane Norton's record on government spending? The state bureaucracy she managed grew by $43 million in just three years. Record taxes and reckless spending has cost Colorado jobs.

Norton is a former lieutenant governor who got early backing from national Republican Party leaders. Buck, on the other hand, is the Weld County District Attorney and a former U.S. attorney and has received backing from the tea party movement.

There are a lot of facts to sort through here. In this report, we're fact-checking the claim about Norton growing state bureaucracy; we also fact-checked whether she supported ""the largest tax hike in Colorado history."" And we're examining Norton's charges against Buck in still another report.

Americans for Job Security said that ""the state bureaucracy she managed grew by $43 million in just three years."" The group -- a business league that's not required to disclose its donors -- based its claims on Norton's tenure as executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment from 1999 to 2002. Norton was appointed by then Gov. Bill Owens, also a Republican. The department is in charge of public health, as well as things like air quality and nursing home regulations.

Under Norton's tenure, the budget did grow from $226 million to $269 million. But most of that increase came from federal funds or cash funds from things like user fees. State funds to the department increased for a few years but then declined. Over Norton's entire tenure, state funding dropped from $23.7 million to $16.2 million.

Finally, we should note that some people don't believe a state agency director has that much control over the amount of money an agency receives from the state. The reduction in state funding was part of large-scale budget cutting during a year of low tax revenues, according to a review of Norton's tenure at the Public Health and Environment Department in the Denver Post.

The Americans for Job Security ad said that ""the state bureaucracy she managed grew by $43 million in just three years."" The ad leaves out the fact that state funding was lower at the end of her tenure than it had been at the beginning.

Ken Buck's budget increased, but commissioners said it was justified
","
A Republican primary for the U.S. Senate seat in Colorado is heating up with a battle of television ads.

Jane Norton recently attacked her opponent over a set of ads being run by Americans for Job Security, a pro-business advocacy group.

""Seen those TV ads attacking me? They're paid for by a shady interest group doing the bidding of Ken Buck. You'd think Ken would be man enough to do it himself,"" Norton says in the ad.

""Here's the truth: In state government, I cut budgets, cut programs and reduced staff,"" Norton continues. ""Ken Buck's Office? His spending skyrocketed by 40 percent. We need a senator who's actually cut spending, and has the backbone to stand her ground.""

Norton is a former lieutenant governor who got early backing from some national Republican Party leaders. Buck is the Weld County District Attorney and a former U.S. attorney and has received backing from the tea party movement.

Here, we'll look at Norton's statement about Ken Buck that spending at his office ""skyrocketed by 40 percent."" We've also fact-checked the ad that Norton was responding to and explained more about the group Americans for Job Security.

We contacted Norton's office to ask for back-up for her statement about Buck's office, but they didn't get back to us.

The Weld County Commission, though, said the District Attorney's budget increased by 30 percent during Buck's tenure, not as much as Norton's ad said. From 2005 to 2009, the budget increased from $3.4 million to $4.4 million, they said. (Buck was elected in November 2004; Weld County is northwest of Denver.)

We wanted to double-check their numbers, so we reviewed budget documents from Weld County. We found there are a number of ways to look at the budget, depending on whether you include budgets for special programs in different years. (A victim's assistance program is one example.) We looked at the base budgets, though, and found that the 2005 budget was closer to $3.2 million. The difference between $3.2 million and $3.4 million isn't much, but it's enough to push the percentage growth from 30 percent to 38 percent.

Whatever the number, the commission defended the increase in a formal letter signed by all five commissioners. They noted that the budget grew along with the population of the county and as the number of its courts in Weld County increased as well. Crime, meanwhile, decreased.

""The Weld County Commissioners are impressed with the return on investment we have made in our District Attorney's Office and would not approve budget increases if we didn't believe it was to the benefit of our county,"" they said.

The commissioners noted that the population increased 40 percent between 2000 and 2009. However, we calculated the population change from 2005 to 2009, the time period in question, and found the population increased 12 percent.

We will stipulate that there are several different ways to look at the District Attorney's office budget, but whichever way you look at it, the budget increased somewhere between 30 and 40 percent, which is pretty close to Norton's claim. On the other hand, the Weld County Commission defended the increase as appropriate and a good use of resources, an important idea for voters to consider. So we rate Norton's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B70880>],/factchecks/2010/jul/26/jane-norton/ken-bucks-budget-increased-commissioners-said-it-w/

In New Mexico gubernatorial race, Susana Martinez accuses Diane Denish of using federal dollars to pay for Christmas cards
","
With New Mexico's two-term Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson leaving office later this year, a lively contest to succeed him has broken out between Democratic Lt. Gov. Diane Denish and Republican challenger Susana Martinez.

In a recent ad, Martinez charged, ""As jobs were lost, Richardson-Denish wasted millions. ... Denish even spent federal stimulus funds on campaign Christmas cards.""

We wondered whether the charge was accurate, and how serious a breach it would be.

The expenditures came to light on Nov. 4, 2009, when the New Mexico Watchdog -- a blog sponsored by the libertarian Rio Grande Foundation -- published an investigation of expenditures from 2003 and 2004, when Denish was lieutenant governor. The blog alleged, and documents from Denish confirm, that Denish used some federal stimulus funds to pay a contract employee. It's worth noting that the stimulus funds in question were not from the bill signed by President Barack Obama in February 2009 but rather from a 2003 bill signed by President George W. Bush. Here's what the Watchdog wrote:

""Lt. Governor Diane Denish used $225,000 in federal funds to pay for a driver to shuttle her to meetings and press events, a contractor to take Christmas pictures and write Christmas cards, a lawyer to make hotel reservations, opinion polling, and public relations services. The money was given to her for 'various projects' by Governor Bill Richardson. The money came from unallocated federal fiscal stimulus funds transferred to the New Mexico treasury under the 2003 Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act.""

Of these expenditures, the most widely noted became the Christmas cards, and we'll focus on that alone, since that's what the ad talks about. (A detailed discussion of the controversy by journalist Heath Haussamen in the New Mexico Independent, including links to original documents, can be found here.)

The Watchdog blog post said that Lauran Cowdrey, one of the contractors who had been paid using the excess federal funds, had filed an invoice, which was eventually paid, for ""6 hours at $23.50 per hour on November 22, 2004, detailed in her time sheet as 'taking Christmas pictures, removing decorations, setting up pre-K interviews, organizing speeches and releases for website. On November 24, 2004, Cowdrey billed 8 hours described as 'work on Christmas card, work on history book request.'""

With jockeying for the 2010 gubernatorial election already well under way, several GOP hopefuls, including Martinez, jumped on the allegations. Denish's office immediately responded by providing a bill and canceled check for the Christmas cards, which totaled $3,666.90. The check, dated Dec. 28, 2004, was written on a campaign account rather than using federal funds routed through the state government. So that clears the actual purchase of the cards from any potential federal violation. But that doesn't account for the money paid to Cowdrey to handle the Christmas card project.

Because many public officials are allowed to use taxpayer funds for items such as Christmas cards, we asked the Denish campaign whether these particular cards were considered official business or a campaign project. They said that it was considered a campaign project.

Because of that, it was improper to bill the state for it, ethics experts told PolitiFact. Instead, the campaign should have paid for Cowdrey's efforts or else she could have volunteered her time.

But how big a deal was it that the taxpayers paid for Cowdrey's time working on the project? Our sources agreed: Not big at all.

We estimate that the misallocated fedral funds would have been, at most, $141, or six hours times her $23.50 per hour pay rate. We asked government ethics experts what they thought of such a violation.

""As a practical matter, because the use of the employee's time was essentially incidental, no enforcement authority is likely to get interested this,"" said Kenneth A. Gross, a former associate general counsel of the Federal Election Commission who is now an attorney with the firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. ""If there is a way to reimburse the government, it may be prudent to do so as a political matter.""

Holman, of Public Citizen, called the violation ""so minor that I would not expect significant penalties, if any. It sounds like a small, careless action. A warning would probably be sufficient.""

We should remind readers that there were many allegations in the original Watchdog report that came with bigger pricetags, but we aren't ruling on them in this item. Haussamen noted one case in which Denish decided to reimburse her state office after he published evidence that some of the stimulus funds had been spent on putting out political news releases.

All told, we think the documentation makes clear that Denish spent federal stimulus funds to prepare Christmas cards, and the canceled campaign check justifies the ad calling them ""campaign Christmas cards."" Even so, our experts agreed that these actions would have produced a monetary loss so small that they would be unlikely to trigger anything beyond a warning and a request for repayment, if that. So we rate the ad Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C70E80>],/factchecks/2010/jul/26/susana-martinez/new-mexico-gubernatorial-race-susana-martinez-accu/
