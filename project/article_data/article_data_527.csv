Do one-third of Floridians own guns?
","After 17 people were killed in a Florida high school shooting on Valentine’s Day, MSNBC political analyst Joy Reid blamed lawmakers’ inaction on gun control and the gun lobby for allowing a proliferation of guns in Florida. ""One-third of Floridians own guns,"" Reid tweeted Feb. 14. ""One-third."" Reid continued: ""Florida is where ‘stand your ground’ laws were born. Florida politicians tried to ban doctors from asking abuse victims if there's a gun in the home. Florida is awash in assault weapons. Want to know why? Ask Marion Hammer and the NRA."" The first ""stand your ground"" law was passed in Florida in 2005, but we wondered about Florida’s gun ownership rate that Reid cited.  We found that Reid’s claim about gun ownership is accurate, based on a study that used 2013 survey. But that study is chock-full of caveats. According to a brief report by Injury Prevention, an international peer-reviewed journal, the gun ownership rate in Florida in 2013 was 32.5 percent, the same as the one-third figure Reid cited. The study, led by former Columbia University public health researcher Bindu Kalesan, extrapolated its numbers from a nationally representative survey of 4,000 people in 2013, that were 18 years or older.  Kalesan, now a professor at Boston University School of Medicine & Boston School of Public Health, told PolitiFact Florida that Reid’s claim is accurate based on the study. The study also found that roughly one-third of the nation owns guns, about 29.1 percent. By state, gun ownership varied considerably, from 5.2 percent in Delaware to 61.7 percent in Alaska. Florida is not an outlier when it comes to gun ownership, based on this study. For example, it showed Texas ownership at 35.9 percent.  We ran the survey by a few experts to get their take on its findings. The biggest complaint was that the survey wasn’t large enough to establish state-based numbers with certainty. ""The survey is not representative of state ownership,"" said Matt Miller, a professor of health sciences and epidemiology at Northeastern University. ""The researchers applied the data to the states even though the source of the data cautioned people not to do that."" Miller and David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the best measurement for gun ownership in Florida comes from the early 2000s. The Centers for Disease Control’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System asked health-related questions to hundreds of thousands of people each year.   There were gun questions on the 2001, 2002, and 2004 national questionnaire. Hemenway said in 2001, 24.5 percent of Floridians said they had a gun in the home. It’s worth noting we also found research on the national level from a June 2017 Pew Research Center survey, which found three in 10 U.S. adults said they own a gun, and an additional 36 percent say that ""while they don’t own one now, they might be open to owning a gun in the future."" Just like the Injury Prevention study, the sample size for the study was around 4,000 respondents, but it was not extrapolated to a state level.   Reid said, ""One-third of Floridians own guns."" Reid’s claim is accurate based on a 2015 survey that showed that 32.5 percent of Floridians owned guns 2013. However, experts said that the national survey data was not meant to represent the state level. Having said that, experts agreed there hasn’t been any good research on state ownership levels since the early 2000s when it was around 25 percent in Florida. Reid’s number seems to be in the ballpark, but it’s important for people to know there is some uncertainty.

No, 4 million Democrat votes were not declared fraudulent
","There is no evidence that millions of votes by Democrats were tossed due to faulty voting machines, despite what a headline said on Facebook. ""Breaking: four million Democrat votes just declared fraudulent,"" stated a Feb. 7 headline on The Politico News, a fake news website with a similar name to Politico, a real news website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story provides no evidence and repeats the same story posted by the satirical fake news website Reagan was Right, adding in a screenshot of Fox News’ Lou Dobbs. Several fake stories during the past couple of years have alleged voter fraud to the benefit of Democrats or involving undocumented immigrants following an election cycle in which Donald Trump repeatedly made ridiculous statements about voter fraud. After being sworn into office, Trump continued to falsely claim substantial evidence of voter fraud. Voter fraud does happen, but not to the widespread amount that Trump has alleged. The Politico News story said that voting machines in 11 states have been declared ""compromised"" as a result of a software glitch — and as a result, the story says, ""17 elections involving ballot referendums for free entitlements for immigrants, legalized marijuana and decriminalizing heroin overdoses should be overturned."" The story said that the company that owns the machines, Novus Ordo Seclorum, INC, is owned by a group of Democrats including George Soros, Chelsea Clinton, Barack and Michelle Obama, and the estate of John Kennedy. According to LinkedIn, Novus Ordo Seclorum was a Delaware consulting firm formed in 2010 to help identify strengths and weaknesses in businesses. Its profile makes no mention of voting machines. It’s unclear if the company still exists; the website was a dead link and the voicemail for the phone number was full. Not surprisingly for a made-up story, we found no evidence that the company is owned by the high-profile Democrats it mentioned. Brenda Bowser Soder, U.S. Election Assistance Commission spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that Novus Ordo Seclorum doesn’t make voting machines and that the story is inaccurate. There is no evidence that 4 million Democratic votes were ""just declared fraudulent.""

"['Elections', 'Florida', 'Corey Lewandowski']","
Have Democrats gained 50 seats formerly held by Republicans since Trump was elected?
","President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager had a prescient message for Republican voters: get out and vote, or risk losing more seats to Democrats. Corey Lewandowski traveled to Sarasota on Feb. 11, along with former Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie, to rally for Florida House candidate James Buchanan, a Republican in a tight race against Democrat Margaret Good with Trump barely winning the district in 2016. ""The Democrats are highly motivated,"" Lewandowski told the crowd at Dolphin Aviation. ""They are winning elections in places where they shouldn’t. We’ve seen them win state House races in Wisconsin. We’ve seen them win big mayor’s races in New Hampshire. Fifty seats have already changed hands from the Republicans to the Democrats since Donald Trump was elected."" We wanted to know whether Democrats gained 50 seats formerly held by Republicans since Trump’s election. The bulk of Lewandowski’s count is backed up by legislative races. The trend even played out in the very district Lewandowski was trying to keep red, with Good beating out Buchanan for the Sarasota seat on Feb. 13. However, we could not verify Lewandowski’s exact figure because he is counting small municipal elections, which can be hard to track. We could not reach him for this fact-check. Many experts we spoke to referred us to an analysis by Daily Kos Elections, which shows that Democrats took 36 seats, as of Feb. 11, 2018. (The Daily Kos is liberal political website. We verified the races on the spreadsheet.) The total includes special election victories, such as Democrat Doug Jones’ win over Republican Roy Moore in Alabama and the special election for a state Senate seat in Wisconsin’s 10th District. It also includes regular elections. For example, Democrats picked up 15 seats in the Virginia statehouse and a few more seats in New Jersey on Election Day in 2017. The Daily Kos list, however, doesn’t include Democrat Phil Murphy’s win over Republican Kim Guadagno in the general election to succeed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The New Jersey governor’s race brings the initial total to 37 Democratic gains. We found a slightly lower total from Geoffrey Skelley, the associate editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Skelley found that Democrats have gained 33 seats on net in special elections for state and federal legislature and elections in New Jersey and Virginia. Unlike the Daily Kos, Skelley’s net total reflects that Republicans took three seats away from Democrats in special elections and one seat away in New Jersey. From here, we tried to find examples of municipal races where Democrats won seats from Republicans — not an easy task. There is no database of smaller municipal elections nationwide. Further, municipal elections are often nonpartisan races, so candidates aren’t officially latched to one party or the other. With those limitations, we searched news stories. An article by the Huffington Post about  ""historic victories"" by Democrats on Nov. 7, 2017, includes two clear-cut examples of Democratic mayoral candidates beating Republican incumbents, including the Manchester, N.H., mayor’s race that Lewandowski mentioned in his speech. Adding those races to the highest number of state-level wins brings our verified total to at least 39 flipped seats for Democrats. Regardless of the exact number, there’s no denying Lewandowski’s point: Democrats have won a significant number of elections since Trump won the presidency. ""Bottom line is that President Trump is energizing the Democratic Party,"" said Nathan Gonzales, the editor and publisher of Inside Elections, which provides nonpartisan analysis of campaigns for Congress, governorships and president. Skelley said that the shift ""reflects the pendulum-swing nature of politics."" ""Given the fact that Democrats lost nearly 1,000 state legislative seats during Obama’s time in office, including a multitude of losses in his first midterm cycle in 2010, I don’t think Democratic gains in the early days of Trump’s presidency are unprecedented,"" Skelley said. Lewandowski said, ""Fifty seats have already changed hands from the Republicans to the Democrats since Donald Trump was elected."" We found evidence of almost 40 seats that flipped from Republican to Democratic control since Trump took office. The bulk happened at the state legislative level. However, Lewandowski is also counting small municipal elections, which are harder to track. We found a couple of examples of Democratic mayors beating Republican incumbents. Beyond mayor’s races, it’s hard to say a seat flipped when some local elections are nonpartisan. We could not reach Lewandowski to explain how he got to 50. Given that we couldn’t duplicate Lewandowski’s total but he’s right about the trend, we rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC80E840>],/factchecks/2018/feb/15/corey-lewandowski/have-democrats-gained-50-seats-formerly-held-repub/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Consumer Safety', 'Corporations', 'Legal Issues', 'Wisconsin', 'Tim Burns']","
Tim Burns, who mostly represents businesses suing insurers, misleads in calling self consumer lawyer
","Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Tim Burns, a Democrat outspoken about his liberal political views, describes himself as the grandson of Mississippi sharecroppers who is running for ""people who struggle."" In his first TV ad, released Feb. 6, 2018, the Madison attorney portrays himself in a similar vein when the narrator says: Meet Tim Burns. He grew up without much and became one of America’s leading consumer lawyers. But if you’re picturing an attorney who mainly represents individuals,that’s not Burns. Burns, who faces left-leaning Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet and conservative Sauk County Circuit Court Judge Michael Screnock in the Feb. 20, 2018 primary, has represented individuals in some class-action lawsuits. But his specialty is representing big businesses, not consumers, that sue their insurance companies. And leaving aside the claim in his TV ad, Burns has often described himself as having major business clients, not as a consumer lawyer. Overview of Burns’ legal background A Milwaukee Journal Sentinel review of Burns’ legal background found: He has a law practice that focuses on suing insurers. His clients have included a mining company that couldn’t get an insurance payout when a Colorado quarry collapsed in a landslide and all mining ceased; and Stryker Corp., a Michigan manufacturer suing its insurer because the insurer denied coverage for injury claims filed by people who alleged the company’s ""Uni-knee"" knee replacement product was defective and caused injuries. Burns told the Journal Sentinel about representing Stryker: ""I wasn’t representing the client against the little guy. I was representing the client against the big insurance company. … What I’m trying to do is to get the insurance company to pay for the problem because insurance companies have promised to pay for problems."" But, to be clear, in that case Burns was not representing an individual suing a hip replacement manufacturer. Rather, he was representing the manufacturer in a lawsuit, with the manufacturer trying to get its insurance company to pay individuals for claims about injuries caused by its products. That’s in contrast to consumer attorneys such as Milwaukee lemon law lawyer Vince Megna, who built his career by suing car dealers and manufacturers, and ran for the Supreme Court in 2013. Burns’ evidence To back Burns’ claim about being a consumer lawyer, his campaign began its description of Burns’ legal work to us by saying he built a national practice representing policyholders, ""otherwise known as insurance consumers."" Burns himself told us: ""I’m using a dictionary definition of consumer,"" in that businesses consume insurance. ""I am 100 percent a consumer lawyer,"" he said. But the usual understanding of a consumer -- particularly in the context of Burns’ campaigning as a fighter for ordinary people -- is an individual. The understanding is not that a business is a consumer simply because it buys insurance. Burns’ campaign also cited to us a page from the website of Perkins Coie; Burns is a partner in the Seattle-based law firm’s Madison office. That page says the firm’s insurance recovery attorneys (Burns is one) have helped shape ""pro-policyholder law."" But the page doesn’t mention consumers. In contrast, the firm touts having represented ""leading companies in almost every industry, including Fortune 500 and Global 500 companies, as well as public sector policyholders."" Burns’ campaign also cited a handful of cases in which Burns represented individuals. In a 2015 lawsuit, for example, he and other lawyers represented a New York man in a class-action lawsuit. The suit claimed MetLife was not setting aside the required reserves for the purpose of paying potential insurance claims and that MetLife should reimburse him and the other class members for premiums they paid. But by and large, Burns’s clients are not individuals, but businesses -- as he himself has stated on at least three occasions. Burns’ own statements 1. Answering candidate questions from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum, Burns emphasized his business clients when he wrote: I’ve built a national practice as one of America’s leading attorneys in standing up to massive insurance companies. I have been hired by major businesses in three dozen states and 10 foreign countries to handle their most sensitive insurance issues, but I’ve also represented regular working people in class actions seeking to hold insurance companies accountable for financial fraud …. In the current field of candidates and on the current Supreme Court, I have the most experience working with American businesses by far. I’ve been hired by the many of the top manufacturing, banking, and investment companies in the world or their boards of directors to advise them on their most sensitive issues concerning liability and insurance. 2. His campaign website also touts major clients, saying: Tim is one of America's leading attorneys in standing up to large insurance companies. Tim has been hired by major clients in three dozen states and ten foreign countries to handle their most sensitive issues. 3. The profile Burns put on the business networking site LinkedIn says: Tim Burns is a member of the Insurance Recovery Practice group at Perkins Coie LLP. The Insurance Recovery Practice group has more than thirty lawyers who devote their practice to representing corporate policyholders in insurance coverage matters. And Burns’s profile on his law firm’s website also cites business: Tim is favorably ranked in the 2006 (Illinois), 2007 (recommended in ""Insurance"" nationally), and 2008 to 2016 (Band 2 - nationally) editions of Chambers USA: America's Leading Lawyers for Business. The picture is clear. Our rating Burns says he is ""one of America's leading consumer lawyers."" The bulk of his legal work is not representing individual consumers, but rather large businesses that are suing their insurers. We rate Burns’ statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE1B0C0>],/factchecks/2018/feb/15/tim-burns/tim-burns-who-mostly-represents-businesses-suing-i/

Andrew White says 'large' number of Texas schools don't offer sex education
","Houston businessman Andrew White, a Democratic aspirant for governor, said that when he’s elected, he’ll step up sex education in schools. White, speaking in January 2018 to David Martin Davies of Texas Public Radio, declared: ""There is a large number of schools in Texas that don’t even offer sex education. Now that, to me, it’s bizarre. So we have to make these investments. If you really are serious about reducing the demand for abortion, there are some really simple ways to do that -- sex education and access to contraceptives."" We wondered if a large number of Texas schools don’t offer sex education. After emailing White's campaign to ask how he reached his conclusion, we noticed that the Austin-based Texas Freedom Network, which describes itself as the state’s watchdog for monitoring far-right issues, estimated in 2017 that 25.1 percent of the state’s school districts in 2015-16 didn’t teach sex education in their secondary schools--when just 2 percent weren’t doing so in 2007-08, the group previously found. Broadly, the group’s February 2017 report states that in 2015-16, about eight in 10 Texas school districts taught abstinence alone ""or nothing at all when it comes to sex education."" Abstinence-plus programs, including information on contraceptives, showed up in nearly 17 percent of districts. The results were reached starting from a survey sent to 138 of 976 Texas school districts that had high schools that weren’t also charter school districts--plus the state’s 10 highest-enrollment districts. Districts were ""representative of the diversity in geography, enrollment, racial demographics and district type (rural, urban or non-metropolitan/smaller cities) in Texas public schools,"" the report says. The report concedes that it didn’t pin down precisely what’s taught to students in each district. Rather, the group asked which textbooks, third-party programs or curricula and/or speakers that districts had obtained and/or used to teach sex education in middle and high schools. Also, the report says, ""we asked specifically for materials districts had obtained from crisis pregnancy centers or other alternative-to-abortion organizations, any materials that cover sexual orientation, gender identity/expression or abortion, and copies of class schedules and district policies."" To our inquiry, a network spokesman, Dan Quinn, listed the 35 sampled districts found not to be teaching sex education--nearly all of them rural. Health class in high schools Quinn also told us by email: ""A key factor in the increase in the percentage of school districts not offering sex education appears to be the Legislature’s decision in 2009 to drop health class as a high school graduation requirement."" The 2009 Legislature and then-Gov. Rick Perry advanced House Bill 3 into law. It directed the State Board of Education to spell out the classes students would have to pass to fulfill different kinds of graduation plans. Yet the law barred the board from specifying electives, such as health, as classes that had to be taken to graduate. Quinn wrote: ""Health class is often where students get sex ed. Many school districts either continue to offer health as an elective or make it a local graduation requirement, but a substantial number of school districts appear to have dropped health classes since 2009."" The network’s 2017 report states: ""We found that districts with no health class were more than four times more likely to offer no sex education at all (as compared with the overall distribution of districts). Conversely, school districts with health classes were more likely to offer either abstinence-plus or abstinence-only sex education. This finding suggests that the decision to remove health education as a state graduation requirement has contributed to the rise in the percentage of districts that teach students nothing at all about human sexuality in high school,"" the report says. Health classes don’t necessarily cover sex education We further learned that just because a district offers a health class doesn’t mean its students take the class or that the class covers more than the state-required emphasis on abstinence alone as the best practice. The state’s curriculum guidelines for the one-semester health class call for students to analyze the ""effectiveness and ineffectiveness of barrier protection and other contraceptive methods."" They otherwise say each student is expected to analyze the importance of abstinence from sex as the only method that’s 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases. But Lauren Callahan, a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency, cautioned against presuming the guidelines show what’s being taught because, she noted, that’s up to individual districts. State law requires each district board of trustees to establish a local school health advisory council to ""assist the district in ensuring that local community values are reflected in the district's health education instruction."" Also, the law says each board shall choose course materials related to sex education with the council’s advice. Notably too, not all students lately take health classes. Callahan pointed us to annual school health surveys undertaken by the agency. Per the latest results, nearly 52 percent of districts and charter schools in 2015-16 indicated they weren’t requiring all high school students to take ""health education"" to graduate--with 48 percent replying that they did require every student to take a class in health education. Study: Abstinence-plus instruction isn’t widespread The study estimated that 58 percent of districts offered abstinence-only sex education. In contrast, the study says, nearly 17 percent of districts were taking an abstinence-plus approach by having medically accurate information on condoms and other forms of contraception. Quinn noted that in 2007-08, the network previously found, about 4 percent of districts took an abstinence-plus approach. Quinn, asked to identify the districts in its 2017 sample that were found to have abstinence-plus teaching materials, listed 30 districts, including eight of the state’s 10 highest-enrollment districts--such as the Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth and Austin districts. But, Quinn wrote, determining ""how those ab-plus materials are used in classrooms — whether teachers use them as suggested, skip portions, or whatever — was beyond the scope of this project."" Similarly, David C. Wiley, a Texas State University education professor who worked on the study, told us by phone: ""There’s no guarantee that teachers are actually teaching that information."" Upshot: ""Texas kids don’t get much information about contraception,"" Wiley said. As we completed this research, Desi Canela of White's campaign said by email that White reached his conclusion about schools not offering sex education based on the network's 2017 study. Our ruling White said a ""large number"" of Texas schools don’t offer sex education. In fact, most districts offered sex education in high school in 2015-16, according to a statewide analysis, though nearly 60 percent were teaching abstinence alone. The study estimated that 25 percent of districts didn't offer sex education. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

Fake news claims two Russian officials dead in plane crash
","A fake news story said that two Russian officials linked to an infamous dossier and a Russian nuclear agency were among the victims of a plane crash near Moscow that killed all 71 passengers. ""Russian source behind fake Trump dossier killed in Russian plane crash, Rosatom CFO also dead,"" read the headline on a Feb. 11, 2018, post on Puppet String News. The post was flagged on Facebook as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media website’s efforts to combat fake news. The fake news story took a real plane crash and made up the names of some of those who died. Consider the source: Puppet String News describes itself as created by a jaded U.S. Navy veteran who ""decided to get into alternative news to tell the truth to best of ability."" We found many things wrong with the post. The story begins by citing an actual Business Insider story on Belarus-born businessman Sergei Millian as a key source in the Trump-Russia dossier, a 35-page report of opposition research on President Donald Trump, prepared by a former British intelligence officer who was hired by Trump’s Republican and Democratic rivals during the election. Later, the Puppet String News story suggests Millian actually goes by the name Sergey Panchenko and died in the Russian plane crash. Sergey Panchenko is listed on the passenger list released by Russian authorities, but Panchenko is a different person than Millian. The article also refers to Millian as being Russian, but he’s Belarusian. The name ""Sergei Millian"" is not listed at all in the list of passengers who were boarded on the plane. The story offered an unsourced photo of passengers' names who were on the aircraft with Panchenko highlighted. Also killed off in this story is Ivanov Vyacheslav, who is credited with being the CFO of nuclear energy corporation Rosatom, the company at the center of the Uranium One deal. That deal involved the sale of a Canadian company with mining interests in the United States to Russia’s nuclear energy agency. Vyacheslav did hold the CFO position at Rosatom until 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile. According to the company website, the current CFO is Nikolay Soloman. This Ivanov Vyacheslav was not on the plane, but a different man by the name was. The man killed in the plane crash was born in 1986, Snopes reported, whereas the former Rosatom CFO began studying for his degree in 1987. A fake news site said that two Russian officials had died in a plane crash. While the list of victims contained names that matched those of the two officials, they were not the same people.  We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

Have 2 Supreme Court hopefuls campaigned against Scott Walker laws, for legislating from the bench?
","Conventional wisdom on the 2018 primary election for Wisconsin Supreme Court says the real battle is between Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet and Madison lawyer Tim Burns. That’s because they’re viewed as competing for votes on the left, while Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock is seen as the lone conservative. The two candidates who get the most votes in the Feb. 20 primary will face off April 3 for the seat held by Michael Gableman, who is not seeking re-election. Currently, Gableman is among the conservative justices who have 5-2 control on the seven-member court. In his first radio ad of the campaign, Screnock attacked both Dallet and Burns while also alluding to Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who appointed Screnock to the bench. In the spot, released Jan. 29, 2018, Screnock introduces himself and then makes a two-part claim about Dallet and Burns: They have openly criticized laws signed by Governor Walker that they disagree with and are campaigning as activists who will implement their policies from the bench. Is that what Burns -- who has been especially outspoken about his political views -- and Dallet have been doing? It's worth noting that Screnock has hired GOP consultants and has received a $31,152 in-kind donation from the state Republican Party. He also released a radio ad that points out he was appointed to the bench by Walker. But to evaluate his claim, here’s a look at statements made by Burns and Dallet since they announced their candidacies and up until Screnock made his claim about them. ‘Openly criticized’ Walker laws We found that Burns has been repeatedly critical of laws signed by Walker: Burns statements on laws signed by Walker Act 10 Interview, Jan. 8, 2018 Walker’s union-curbing Act 10 ""is blatantly unconstitutional."" Act 10 Speech, June 2, 2017 Justice Michael Gableman (who had not yet announced he would not seek another term) restricted ""workers’ right to bargain."" ‘Walker’s agenda’ League of Women Voters Q&A ""The Wisconsin Supreme Court has been a rubber stamp for Scott Walker’s harmful agenda."" Voter ID Candidate forum, Jan. 29, 2018 ""I believe that gerrymandering and photo ID are great dangers to democracy."" Foxconn Interview, Jan. 8, 2018 On state’s $3 billion incentives for Foxconn: ""I am opposed to the notion of large corporations playing on a different playing field from our small farms and our small businesses."" Burns’ campaign told us this part of Screnock’s statement, as it applies to Burns, is accurate. In contrast, we found only one Dallet statement about a Walker law. But her criticism was of the Supreme Court, not Act 10. Dallet statement on laws signed by Walker Act 10 Interview, Jan. 2, 2018 On a challenge to Walker’s Act 10 union-curbing law: ""I think that the (Supreme) Court got it wrong ….I think that they didn’t analyze the actual issue. The issue in the Act 10 case was whether the right to association was being violated by all of the penalties essentially being put on unions. And they analyzed it under a right to collective bargaining, which everyone agrees, there is no right to collectively bargain. There is a right, instead, to have freedom of association."" Dallet told us in a statement: ""I’ve been careful to limit my criticisms to decisions the court has already made, in cases that have been completed,"" such as the Act 10 case. Now to the second part of Screnock’s claim. ‘Campaigning to implement policies from the bench’ Both Burns and Dallet have made statements indicating positions they hold on issues, though Burns has been considerably more direct. Burns statements ‘Liberal values’ Candidates forum, Jan. 22, 2018 ""On the Wisconsin Supreme Court, I will be an unshakable champion of liberal, democratic and progressive values."" Taxes Interview, Jan. 8, 2018 In response to a question, says taxes on the wealthy should be raised to provide attorneys for poor in civil cases such as evictions. ‘We’ Democrats Interview, Jan. 17, 2018 ""We"" won, referring to victory the previous day by Democrat Patty Schachtner in state Senate special election. ‘I’m a Democrat’ Interview, Jan. 9, 2018 ""I’m a Democrat with a big D."" Middle class Interview, Jan. 17, 2018 ""When the Legislature or a governor passes a law that's a basic attack on our middle-class democracy, that's when courts have to step in and say, No way, Bub."" ‘Progressive majority’ Interview, Jan. 8, 2018 ""We can have a progressive majority on the court by the spring of 2020."" ‘Expanding rights’ Candidates forum, Jan. 22, 2018 ""If expanding rights is legislating from the bench, count me in."" ‘Political values’ Candidates forum, Jan. 22, 2018 ""From day one of this campaign, I have been candid with voters about what my political views are and my belief that political values -- when you have a constitution that talks about equal protection and due process -- ultimately impacts how you decide cases."" ‘Political decisions’ Candidates forum, Jan. 22, 2018 ""I am the first candidate on the left in this state for this position who has said enough is enough with this nonsense that judges don’t make political decisions."" Reproductive rights Candidate forum, Jan. 29, 2018 ""I believe the government has no role in our bedroom or our reproductive decisions, period."" ‘Progressive politics’ Speech, June 2, 2017 ""I am running a nonpartisan race, but I will not run from progressive organizations and I will not run from progressive politics. I am proud of the values we share."" (Speech to Wisconsin Democratic Party convention) Against conservatives Twitter, Jan. 29, 2018 Radio host Jay Weber ""spends a fair amount of time criticizing me, but only after he expresses fear that with this election, conservatives could lose control of the court by 2020.  
In case I have not been clear — THAT IS MY GOAL."" Burns’ campaign rejected this part of Screnock’s claim. A spokeswoman pointed out that Burns has said he believes in giving great deference to the Legislature, but must closely scrutinize cases when a ""law infringes on a protection outlined in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights,"" or ""makes it so democracy cannot repair itself"" or ""infringes on a group that historically does not have political power."" Nevertheless, some of Burns’ statements call for specific actions, such as being a ""champion of liberal"" values, saying his goal is to create a liberal majority on the Supreme Court, saying taxes on the wealthy should be raised and outlining his position on abortion. Dallet, meanwhile, has said justices shouldn’t be elected based on party ties and has criticized Burns for taking positions. For example, she told the 2017 Wisconsin Democratic Party convention: Some will tell you that the solution to partisan judges on the right is to elect more partisan judges, just from the other side. I have a different view of the world, in that I think judges really do need to be independent ….I don’t think the answer is just to come here and tell you that judges need to vote like partisan Democrats to counteract partisan Republican judges. If we fall into the trap of politicizing the third branch, we turn our backs on our true progressive history.

Has President Donald Trump clearly and frequently spoken out against abuse of women? Not when asked
","Two White House staffers have resigned after credible reports that they abused their wives, but those departures haven’t quieted the waters. If anything, the question of what President Donald Trump thinks about these episodes grew more pressing after Trump tweeted broadly about people accused of abuse in any form. ""People’s lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation,"" Trump tweeted Feb. 10. ""Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?"" Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process? When asked on Fox News why Trump hasn't publicly condemned men who beat their wives, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said there should be no doubt where he stands. ""The president has been very clear,"" Gidley said Feb. 12. ""All forms of abuse, all forms of battery against women are deplorable and disgusting."" Fox and Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade interjected, ""But he hasn’t said that."" ""You haven’t talked to him today,"" Gidley said. ""Obviously, he’s said that multiple times in the past. I’ve talked to the president about issues surrounding this type of behavior and he finds it disgusting."" Still, whatever Trump's private thoughts might be, he has held his tongue in the present controversy involving his former aide Rob Porter. Trump did sign a statement about domestic violence. On Sept. 30, 2017, he proclaimed October 2017 as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. ""I call on all Americans to promote the safety and liberty of the women, men, and children who are subjected to violent, intimidating, or controlling behavior at the hands of those closest to them,"" the proclamation read. ""Each of us must be a voice for those suffering in silence and must speak up when we see signs of physical or emotional abuse. Together we can bolster victims’ support networks and encourage and empower them to report offenses."" That was one of more than 100 proclamations Trump has signed on topics ranging from National Financial Accountability Month to Irish-American Heritage Month. On domestic violence, publicly, Trump has yet to follow through on his own call to action. We searched the Nexis news database. We looked through his tweets. ​We found nothing that came from him in his own words recently and clearly decrying domestic abuse as a disgusting act. The closest we found was in 2015 when Trump attacked Hillary Clinton for her husband’s behavior. ""If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong,"" he tweeted Dec. 28, 2015. If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong! Two years earlier, Trump chastised the military for failing to curtail rape and domestic violence within its ranks. ""Army officer who led a sexual abuse prevention unit was just fired after being charged with violently going after his wife. What is going on,"" Trump tweeted May 17, 2013. He continued with, ""General says that the Armed Forces will be severely weakened if the large scale rape and sexual abuse problem is not brought under control."" The White House pointed to Trump’s 2012 comment related to singer Rihanna’s personal life. ""If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish,"" Trump tweeted Oct. 11, 2012. ""A beater is always a beater--just watch!"" If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish. A beater is always a beater--just watch! There are press reports that in private Trump has taken a more negative view, though we can't independently verify them because they are based on anonymous sources. Significantly, Trump praised Porter in public after he resigned. ""He did a very good job when he was in the White House,"" Trump told the TV cameras Feb. 9. ""And we hope he has a wonderful career, and hopefully he will have a great career ahead of him. But it was very sad when we heard about it. And, certainly, he’s also very sad."" Even some Republicans have said they want more from Trump. In an interview with CNN on Feb. 13, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said ""abuse is never okay"" and should not be tolerated among employees. Asked if the president is sending that signal, Ernst said, ""I think he needs to send a stronger message, a stronger message."" Gidley said that on many occasions, Trump has said that abuse of women is disgusting and deplorable. Trump may have said such things privately, but his public stance has been quite different. Trump did sign a proclamation on domestic violence and — years ago, on Twitter — berated the military for allowing rape and abuse to undermine military readiness. But Trump has not conveyed his personal thoughts against domestic abuse when asked about the Porter case directly, and Gidley's comment left viewers with the wrong idea.  Instead, Trump came out against a rush to judgment against those broadly accused of taking advantage of women, which might include physical abuse. And he described Porter's situation as ""very sad"" and wished him well in his career. If there’s a pattern of Trump decrying violence against women, it hasn’t left much of a visible trail. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEFEEC0>],/factchecks/2018/feb/13/hogan-gidley/has-trump-often-spoken-out-against-abuse-women-no/

Jim Renacci says Chuck Schumer voted for the wall in 2006
","U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, R-Ohio, portrayed Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s position on the wall as ever changing after the New York Democrat balked on an offer to fund President Donald Trump’s wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. ""In 2005 or '06 he (Schumer) voted for the wall. So again Schumer seems to be changing his positions all the time...,"" said Renacci on Fox Business Network on Jan. 24. ""This is something that he (Schumer) voted for in 2005 or 2006.  This is something we need, to get immigration moving in the right direction. This is something he already negotiated."" Renacci, who hopes to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown in the Nov. 6 election, supports Trump’s campaign promise to build a wall and is a co-sponsor of a bill to provide billions of dollars in border security measures. We fact-checked Renacci’s claim that Schumer voted for the wall about 12 years ago and found that Schumer supported the construction of a fence. But it was far less extensive than Trump’s wall. This has become a familiar talking point by Republicans, including Trump, to attack Democrats who voted for the fence but have taken stances against Trump’s wall. Renacci’s spokeswoman pointed to Schumer’s vote in favor of the Secure Fence Act of 2006. Schumer was one of 26 Democratic senators, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, to vote in favor of the act when it passed in the Senate by a vote of 80 to 19. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law. The legislation authorized about 700 miles of fencing along parts of the border of the United States and Mexico. It also authorized the use of several tools in an effort to curb illegal immigration, including more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting, as well as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. Originally, the act called on the Department of Homeland Security to install at least two layers of reinforced fencing along some stretches of the border. That was amended later, however, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which got rid of the double-layer requirement. So how is that different from the wall that candidate Trump promised to build? What was voted on in 2006 varies from what Trump promised during the campaign. Trump promised an ""impenetrable"" physical wall. But since the election has toned down that rhetoric and said that parts of the wall could actually be ""see-through"" and fencing could be constructed in some areas instead of a wall. Trump was initially vague on the details about his wall and during the campaign gave varying cost figures, from $8 billion to $12 billion. Trump has continued to say that Mexico would pay for it — but did not offer concrete details on how or a clear timeframe — but he also sought money from Congress. The Wall Street Journal reported on Jan. 5 that his administration outlined to a group of senators plans requesting nearly $18 billion over 10 years to build new and replacement barriers along more than 700 miles of the nearly 2,000-mile long U.S.-Mexico border. The administration's document called for a barrier, referred to as a ""wall system,"" but officials did not specify where it would be constructed. Renacci’s congressional spokeswoman Kelsey Knight said that there isn’t any significant difference between the barrier that Schumer supported in 2006 and Trump’s wall. ""Both are meant to deter physical entry from one side of the border to the other,"" she said. Trump criticized the 2006 fence as too modest during the 2016 campaign. ""Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad,"" Trump said. (Actually, the project didn’t face environmental hurdles; we rated that part of the claim Mostly False.) It’s also worth noting that the political context surrounding the 2006 vote was different from Schumer’s statements about Trump’s wall in the past year. Democrats normally in favor of looser immigration laws saw the Secure Fence Act of 2006 as the lesser of two evils, according to a Boston Globe report that detailed the legislative process. Around that same time, the House passed legislation that would make any undocumented immigrant a felon. Renacci said that in 2005 or 2006, Schumer ""voted for the wall."" Schumer voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. But that fence is not as substantial as Trump’s proposed wall. Trump himself called the 2006 fence a ""nothing wall."" We rate this statement Half True.

Tucker Carlson claims more immigrants now in the United States than any other time. Is that true?
","Fox News’ Tucker Carlson shared on Twitter a key detail of the immigration debate: how many immigrants are in the United States. ""There are more immigrants in our country right now than any other time. Is the country more united? Stronger? Just the opposite & everyone knows it. Maybe that's bc our elites welcome immigrants by telling them how flawed America is and how bigoted its native population #Tucker,"" tweeted Carlson, host of Tucker Carlson Tonight on Feb. 8. There are more immigrants in our country right now than any other time. Is the country more united? Stronger? Just the opposite & everyone knows it. Maybe that's bc our elites welcome immigrants by telling them how flawed America is and how bigoted its native population #Tucker We wondered about the first part of Carlson’s tweet: Does the United States have more immigrants now than ever before? Carlson linked us to reports from the Center for Immigration Studies and Pew Research Center on the growing foreign-born population in the United States, which is now at a record high. It’s also worth noting, however, that the immigrant share of the total U.S. population was its highest in 1890. The U.S. Census Bureau in 1850 began asking people where they born. Large-scale immigration from Europe contributed to an increase of the foreign-born population in the United States from 1850 (2.2 million) to 1930 (14.2 million). ""The late 19th and early 20th century was a time of high immigration (relative to total population) because we had a growing economy (industrialization and urbanization),"" said Mae M. Ngai, a professor of Asian American studies and history at Columbia University. Nonpartisan think tank the Migration Policy Institute said restrictive immigration laws in the 1920s, the Great Depression and World War II then reduced the number of new arrivals. The number of immigrants dropped to 9.6 million by 1970, but has continued to grow since then. Today, the majority of the foreign-born population is from Latin America and Asia, according to the Census bureau. Carlson pointed us to a May 2017 post from the nonpartisan Pew Research Center that said the U.S. foreign-born population reached a record 43.2 million in 2015. ""Since 1965, when U.S. immigration laws replaced a national quota system, the number of immigrants living in the U.S. has more than quadrupled,"" Pew Research Center reported. Carlson also noted that the Center for Immigration Studies in October 2017 said the U.S. immigrant population hit a record 43.7 million in July 2016. (The center, which favors low levels of immigration, analyzed data from the Census’ 2016 American Community Survey. It said the total number of immigrants was likely 45.6 million because some immigrants are missed by the survey.) So the number of immigrants in the United States is the highest it’s ever been. But it’s worth mentioning that 1890 holds the record for the highest percentage of immigrants as a share of the population. The total U.S. population in 1890 was about 63 million, and immigrants accounted for an estimated 14.8 percent. The total population in 2016 was about 323 million, which means about 13.5 percent were immigrants. Through a spokeswoman, Carlson said he never claimed immigrants were at the highest level as a proportion of population. An absolute number has no meaning by itself, ""because it would mean something totally different in a country of 100 million, 200 million, 300 million or for that matter, 1 billion,"" said Ngai, the Columbia University professor. Susan Martin, professor emerita of international migration at Georgetown University, said absolute numbers and proportion can help understand the scale and impact of immigration. ""Absolute numbers are important because each person presents needs and opportunities; proportion is equally important because impacts vary depending on whether the needs of a larger or smaller share of the population must be addressed,"" Martin said. Overall, immigrants’ distribution across the country, how long they’ve been here (on average), their educational levels and and other socio-economic characteristics are also important, Martin said. Carlson tweeted, ""There are more immigrants in our country right now than any other time."" The number of immigrants in the United States is the highest it’s ever been: about 43.7 million. The number of immigrants in the United States has been increasing since 1970, according to the Census bureau. Carlson pointed to the absolute numbers as backup for his claim. But it’s worth noting that immigrants as a share of the population reached its peak in 1890, at 14.8 percent. In 2016, immigrants accounted for 13.5 percent of the population. Carlson’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

FBI was not actively investigating Clinton emails during Page-Strzok text exchange
","Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., jumped to conclusions about former President Barack Obama’s involvement in the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server following the release of a tranche of FBI messages. In one of the texts messages released in a report of the FBI’s handling of the Clinton emails by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., FBI lawyer Lisa Page told Peter Strzok, an FBI agent with whom she was romantically involved, that Obama wanted ""to know everything we’re doing,"" on Sept. 1, 2016. The unspecified subject Obama wanted to know everything about spurred Republican speculation. Gaetz said in a since-deleted tweet that the message referenced the FBI’s investigation of Clinton’s use of a private email address while serving as secretary of state. ""On September 2, 2016, while the FBI was actively investigating @HillaryClinton’s use of a private email server, #Page said that ‘POTUS wants to know everything we’re doing.’ This assertion raises alarming questions about the extent of Obama’s involvement with FBI investigations.""  But the Wall Street Journal reported that associates of Strzok and Page said the texts were about Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election, which they were then investigating. We won’t speculate as to whether the Clinton emails were the subject of this text message. Instead, we were curious about the timeline of events at the FBI. Was the bureau ""actively investigating"" Clinton’s emails on Sept. 2, 2016, as Gaetz said? We found no indication of that. Gaetz’s office did not respond to our initial requests for evidence, and then deleted the tweet. They later told us they had been referring to the State Department, not the FBI. The FBI declined to comment, and the State Department did not respond to our request for comment. On July 5, 2016, then-FBI director James Comey announced of the Clinton email server investigation that, ""After a tremendous amount of work over the last year, the FBI is completing its investigation and referring the case to the Department of Justice for a prosecutive decision."" ""Although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,"" Comey said. On Oct. 28, 2016, Comey made an unexpected announcement in a letter to several members of Congress. ""In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation,"" Comey wrote. ""I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation."" Comey was referring to messages found on Anthony Weiner’s seized computer, where investigators were looking into whether Weiner had committed a crime by sexting a teenage girl. They discovered that Huma Abedin, Clinton’s top aide and Weiner’s wife, also used that laptop to communicate with Clinton, so they decided to investigate whether there was any classified information in them. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who chaired the House Committee on Oversight in 2016, tweeted, ""FBI Dir just informed me, ‘The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.’ Case reopened."" But Comey never used the word reopened because, as NBC News’ Pete Williams reported, the case had never been officially closed. But that doesn’t mean the case was being actively investigated. ""FBI officials told us that as a technical matter, it had not been closed,"" Williams told PolitiFact. ""As I recall, some of the evidence had yet to be returned to the owners, for example, and there were other administrative issues. It would have been incorrect, we were told at the time, to say that the investigation had been ‘closed,’ which is something of a term of art at the FBI."" ""But that is not to say that the email matter was still being ‘actively investigated’ when the emails were discovered,"" Williams added. ""Just because it wasn’t formally closed didn’t mean it was being actively investigated. It wasn’t an either/or."" ""Comey’s July announcement would mean that whatever those agents were doing, it was not working towards making the decision of whether or not to file charges,"" said Artin Afkhami, an associate editor at Just Security. ""The key point here, in other words, is not that Comey is ‘reopening’ a closed matter because of some bombshell,"" Benjamin Wittes, editor in chief of Lawfare, wrote at the time. ""It is that he is amending his public testimony to Congress that the FBI is done while the bureau examines new material that may or may not have implications for investigative conclusions previously reached."" Gaetz’s office told us that after taking a closer look at our request for evidence, they deleted the tweet and corrected the statement to say the State Department, not the FBI, had been actively investigating the server on Sept. 2, 2016. In that case, Gaetz’s office would be correct. The State Department reopened their investigation of Clinton’s emails on July 7, 2016, following a pause as the FBI investigated. We found no evidence they had finished their investigation at the time of the text message. Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, said it would not make sense for FBI agents to have been texting about the State Department investigation. ""The State Department and the FBI conduct separate investigations,"" Mariotti said. ""The State Department has different personnel, different records and different reports. In other words, if an agent was assigned to the State Department investigation, their evidence and reports would be distinct from the FBI."" Gaetz tweeted, ""On September 2, 2016, while the FBI was actively investigating @HillaryClinton’s use of a private email server, #Page said that ‘POTUS wants to know everything we’re doing.’"" We found no evidence the FBI was actively investigating Clinton’s server on Sept. 2, 2016. The case had not been officially closed, but reporting indicates the investigation had ceased until the Weiner emails were discovered through a separate FBI investigation. Gaetz’s office since deleted the tweet and said they meant the State Department, not the FBI. The State Department investigation was active then, but it would have been strange for FBI agents to discuss a separate agency’s investigation.

No, Obama not facing indictment for spying on Trump
","A fake news story on Facebook claims that while the liberal media ""ridiculed"" President Donald Trump over his claim that former President Barack Obama spied on him during the election, America has now learned that Obama did indeed spy and will be indicted. ""Obama did in fact unconstitutionally spy on Trump throughout the presidential election,"" stated a Feb. 1 article by The Global Headlines, a fake news website that bashes Democrats. The clickbait article declares at the conclusion: ""Share this story if you want to see Obama behind bars for the rest of his treasonous life!"" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. There is no evidence that Obama is poised to be indicted or that he wiretapped Trump. A similar, shorter version of this story appeared on freedomnewscenter.com in September and follows a pattern of fake news stories over the past year that said that Obama wiretapped Trump’s phones during the election. Some photos included a doctored photo of Obama in handcuffs in court. On March 4, 2017, Trump tweeted that Obama ordered surveillance on him during the election. As we explained following his tweets, it’s possible the Trump White House is privy to investigative activities that aren’t in the public record. However, it appeared more likely that Trump took several media reports about legitimate intelligence investigations into his associates’ possible Russia ties and wove them into a new, unsubstantiated theory that Obama himself did something illegal. The New York Times and Washington Post reported — based on anonymous sources — that FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department to publicly refute Trump’s tweets because they wrongly imply the FBI broke the law. Additionally, an Obama spokesman has categorically denied that the Obama White House ordered any wiretapping. The Global Headlines story focused on comments by former CIA analyst and retired Army Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer, who was interviewed following Trump’s tweets. Shaffer, who is frequently interviewed on Fox News and works for the conservative London Center for Policy Research, told Newsweek in 2016 that the incoming Trump administration asked him to apply for a job. The Global Headlines mentioned a ""recent"" interview by Shaffer on the radio show ""Trending Today USA,"" but that interview was actually 11 months ago. The interviewer asked Shaffer if Obama should be arrested: ""This could be first time a former president could be indicted for a felony, because I think that it’s very possible that he acted outside the scope of his duties, responsibilities and authorities to turn the resources of a nation’s state on a candidate,"" he said in a clip of the interview. ""This is, as I said before, Soviet dictator-level wrongdoing."" There is no evidence that Obama himself ordered wiretapping to spy on Trump during the election and is now headed toward an indictment. Trump tweeted in 2017 that Obama had ordered surveillance on him. While there have been media reports about intelligence investigations into Trump’s associates’ possible Russia ties, there is no proof that Obama himself ordered wiretapping of Trump.

Food stamps dropped nationally, but after temporary spike following hurricanes
","The number of people on food stamps plummeted nationwide in November, according to Breitbart, a conservative news website. ""Food stamp enrollment drops by four million in one month,"" stated the Feb. 7 headline. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that the numbers are accurate, but as the story explained, the decline occurred after a spike as a result of a program to temporarily provide food stamps to people in areas damaged by hurricanes. Ultimately, the number of food stamp clients in November was on par with many of the preceding months before the impacts of Hurricane Irma in Florida and Hurricane Harvey in Texas. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federal government program to help low-income people buy groceries. The average per person monthly benefit was around $126 last year. Breitbart accurately quoted monthly data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture which showed that the number of participants in SNAP dropped from about 45.7 million in October 2017 to 41.7 million in November 2017 — a decrease of about four million. Breitbart explained that the decline was preceded by an increase following temporary Disaster-SNAP enrollment in Florida and Texas after the hurricanes. Food stamp clients jumped by about three million between September and October nationwide after the USDA approved Disaster-SNAP for Florida and Texas. Jessica Sims, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Children and Families, said that DCF handed out these disaster benefits to 3.1 million people between late September and early December. In Texas, there were 1.6 million individuals served. SNAP acts as a first responder after natural disasters, providing assistance to households that may be vulnerable as a result of their place of employment temporarily closing, or facing expenses due to damage or relocation, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Breitbart’s statement about the four-million drop in one month makes for a catchy headline, but if we put it in context and look at the data over a few months, it showed that the November enrollment of about 41.7 million is in the same ballpark as many of the past several months, for example in May when there were 41.6 million SNAP clients. Experts told PolitiFact that monthly enrollment can fluctuate due to factors such as disaster assistance, so it’s more useful to look at longer stretches such as annual data to understand trends. Breitbart accurately noted that food stamp enrollment has been on the decline since fiscal year 2013. Annual SNAP data shows enrollment climbed from about 28.2 million in 2008 to 47.6 million in 2013 and has declined every year since that time. SNAP enrollment hit 42.2 million in 2017. SNAP enrollment fluctuates based on the economy. National enrollment climbed between 2007 and 2013 amid the recession and sluggish initial recovery. The rising numbers were as a result of expanded eligibility and outreach, which began under President George W. Bush including a commitment to expand funding. Also, the 2009 stimulus package signed by President Barack Obama expanded eligibility. So far there have been no explicit changes implemented to SNAP since Trump took office in January 2017 to give him credit for the decline, said James Ziliak, director of the center for Poverty Research at the University of Kentucky. ""To the extent that the economy has continued to grow under President Trump, including rising wages, then to the extent that his policies have not interfered with this pre-existing trend he deserves some credit,"" he said. The Trump administration has made some moves toward work requirements for people who receive certain government services, including food stamps. Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said at a press conference in May 2017 that people need to get a job to be eligible for food stamps going forward: ""If you’re on food stamps and you’re able-bodied, then we need you to go to work,"" he said. The federal government has sought input from the states in an effort to promote employment for food stamp recipients. According to the USDA, many SNAP households already have a person working. Nearly one-third of all SNAP households and 55 percent of households with children had earnings in 2015. We emailed the Breitbart reporter and did not get a reply. Breitbart said that ""Food stamp enrollment drops by four million in one month."" Data from the USDA showed that the number of SNAP participants dropped from about 45.7 million in October to 41.7 million in November, a decrease of about four million. But as Breitbart explained, there was a temporary spike in enrollment due to Disaster-SNAP, including in Florida, as a result of a hurricane. In general, comparing two months doesn’t tell us much about longer-term trends. But Breitbart noted that food stamps have declined since 2013, which is accurate. We rate this claim Mostly True.

Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert says 80 percent of individual donations from Wall Street go to Democrats
","You’ll often hear Democratic politicians decry income inequality and the pattern of the rich getting richer. But at the New Hampshire Freedom Summit -- a gathering in Manchester, N.H., sponsored by the conservative groups Americans for Prosperity and Citizens United -- Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, got into the action, too. Gohmert, though, took aim at Democrats for hypocrisy. ""The dirty little secret on Wall Street: Eighty percent of the Wall Street executives’ and their spouses' donations go to Democrats,"" Gohmert said. ""It’s like they’ve got some kind of little sweet deal, where we’ll call you fat cats and demean you and stuff, but you will get richer than your wildest dreams. It’s time for that to stop."" We wondered: Is it really true that ""80 percent of Wall Street executives and their spouses' donations go to Democrats""? We asked Gohmert’s office for their sourcing, and they provided several columns in the National Review by Michael Franc of the conservative Heritage Foundation. In one of them, Franc wrote that ""a review of Federal Election Commission data for the current presidential-election cycle sheds light on this important question. Judging by who they support for president, a strong majority of employees at the highest reaches of Wall Street’s big financial institutions are, well, big liberals. More Wall Streeters shower far more money -- both overall as well as on average -- on the more liberal presidential candidates than on their more conservative alternatives."" Franc wrote that he used Fundrace 2008, a campaign-finance data tool created by the Huffington Post, to look at donations from such employees as investment bankers, managing directors and senior managing directors. He found that at Bear Stearns, 68 percent of individual donations went to Democrats. At JPMorgan Chase, it was 75 percent. At Lehman Brothers, it was 69 percent. At Goldman Sachs, the Democratic share was more than two-thirds (Franc didn’t specify in his article), while at Morgan Stanley it was more than half. At American International Group, it was 76 percent. Indeed, among the firms Franc looked into, only individuals at Merrill Lynch gave a majority to Republicans. Right off the top, though, there’s an important caveat to how Gohmert portrayed Franc’s figures. Gohmert used the present tense, but -- as you might expect, given the presence of the now-defunct Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers in the data and the use of a tool called ""Fundrace 2008"" -- Franc’s research was both conducted and published in 2008. Not only is that four campaign cycles ago, but there’s also been a sea change in Wall Street’s partisan preferences since then. The Center for Responsive Politics, which downloads Federal Election Commission disclosures by donors and candidates and sorts them into user-friendly categories, addressed this question in a 2013 report. The center wrote that Wall Street money, like much big money in politics, follows power, and after Democrats took control of the House and Senate in 2006, they began to increase their share of donations. ""As recently as 2009, Democrats were collecting more campaign cash from Wall Street than Republicans,"" the center wrote. However, the center added, ""that dynamic shifted at the end of 2009, with more money flowing to Republicans in 2010."" And starting in 2011, the report continued, ""the gap widened and Wall Street's financial support for one party (the GOP) began to tip the scales."" In the 2012 campaign cycle, donations by individuals in the center’s ""securities and investment"" category -- the closest category to ""Wall Street"" -- were running 70 percent to Republicans, 30 percent to Democrats, and so far during the 2014 cycle, 63 percent of the industry’s money is going to Republicans, with 36 percent to Democrats. For individuals in the category ""commercial banks,"" 71 percent of donations went to Republicans in 2012 and 74 percent so far in 2014. And for the umbrella category ""finance, insurance, and real estate,"" 66 percent went to Republicans in 2012 and 58 percent so far in 2014. For each of these three categories, the year Franc based his data on -- 2008 -- was either the high point or close to the high point for Wall Street donors’ friendliness to Democrats (at least going back to 1990, when the center began collecting this data). Douglas Weber, a Center for Responsive Politics senior researcher, noted that Goldman Sachs had a clear Democratic edge in donations between 1990 and 2008, peaking at 2008 with 75 percent to Democrats in total giving (which, unlike Franc’s data above, includes political action committees and outside groups). But Goldman has since turned on a dime, with the share of donations to Democrats shifting to just 39 percent in 2010, 36 percent in 2012 and 34 percent so far in 2014. ""Wall Street liked candidate Obama more than President Obama,"" Weber said. So by relying on Franc’s data from 2008, Gohmert isn’t just using old data -- he’s using the peak historical year for Democratic giving, and ignoring three subsequent cycles in which Wall Street tilted its donations in precisely the opposite direction. There are other problems with Gohmert’s claim beyond it being outdated: • None of Franc’s published data reaches 80 percent. Gohmert’s stated percentage exaggerates even what’s in Franc’s data. • Gohmert conflated ""Democrats"" with ""Obama"" and the presidential race with all races. Franc, unlike Gohmert, noted this in his piece that his analysis doesn’t ""delve into employee contributions to candidates for the House and Senate."" That means Franc’s study covers a much narrower slice of the data than one would assume just by hearing from Gohmert’s comment. When we reached Franc -- now an aide to House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. -- he didn’t defend the specific language Gohmert used. But he said he believes Gohmert’s underlying point -- that affluent ""elites"" lean Democratic, despite the party’s attacks ""the rich"" -- is fair. ""If he mixed up the statistics in some way, it is the broader point that matters,"" Franc said. ""Elites behave politically far differently than the conventional wisdom says they do. … The Democrats still overperform politically in congressional districts with heavy concentrations of wealth and post-graduate education."" Our ruling Gohmert said that ""80 percent of Wall Street executives and their spouses' donations go to Democrats."" Gohmert would have had a stronger argument if he’d said that was the case six years ago, when candidate Barack Obama was vacuuming up Wall Street donations. The problem is, that’s no longer true. In fact, the exact opposite pattern has held for Wall Street donations during the past three election cycles. In addition, Gohmert overstated Franc’s percentages and ignored the difference between donations to Democratic presidential candidates and congressional candidates. We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8E2E00>],/factchecks/2014/apr/17/louie-gohmert/texas-republican-rep-louie-gohmert-says-80-percent/

RT anchor says U.S. spends big on military
","A correspondent for RT, the English-language cable news network funded by the government of Russia, and CNN anchor Chris Cuomo recently debated the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and the media’s role. Cuomo suggested that CNN and other American media outlets are right to question to what extent Russia is meddling in the events in Ukraine. RT correspondent Anissa Naouai took the opposite tack, saying that the American media is believing everything the government in Kiev is saying while claiming news coming out of Russia is propaganda. You can watch the debate here if you like, but what struck us was a claim by Naouai about the American military. When Cuomo described the United States as ""war weary,"" Naouai responded: ""War weary?"" she asked. ""The U.S. spends more money on its military than the 16 biggest military budgets in the world. I wouldn’t call the U.S. military weary."" From the context, it is clear that Naouai was talking about the next 16 biggest military budgets in the world combined. That’s what we decided to check. We found two credible groups that attempt to track military spending around the globe, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London think tank, and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. There are flaws in each group’s numbers -- the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute uses budget figures (not expenditures), and some countries don’t release detailed information on military spending -- but they are generally considered the best approximations available. For the record, Naouai referred us to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, but we’ll look at both. Both groups recently released data for 2013. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute put the U.S. defense budget at just over $600 billion, while the International Institute for Strategic Studies uses a figure of $640 billion. Either number dwarfs the amount of spending by any other country, and plenty of countries combined, both groups conclude. But not the 16 next-biggest countries combined, as Naouai claimed on CNN. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the next 16 biggest militaries spent $801 billion in 2013, and the United States spends as much on the military as the next eight countries combined (China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and India). 
 Graphic: Stockholm International Peace Research Institute The International Institute for Strategic Studies only makes the top 15 spenders available for free. According to their analysis, the United States spent $600 billion on defense while the next 14 countries spent a combined $634.5 billion. By the International Institute for Strategic Studies analysis, the United States spends as much as the next 12 biggest countries combined. 
 Graphic: International Institute for Strategic Studies Our ruling Naouai said, ""The U.S. spends more money on its military than the 16 biggest military budgets in the world."" The United States is definitely No. 1 on the world’s defense spending list. But its expenditures don’t eclipse the next 16 biggest counties combined as Naouai said, according to two independent groups. While we don't think viewers would get a markedly different impression if Naouai had said 8 or 12 instead of 16, her figures are off by a significant-enough margin. As such, we rate her statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA41640>],/factchecks/2014/apr/16/anissa-naouai/rt-anchor-says-us-spends-big-military/
"['Civil Rights', 'Legal Issues', 'LGBTQ', 'Marriage', 'Texas', 'David Boies']","
Attorney overstates number of federal judges who have sided with same-sex marriage advocates since June 2013
","For nearly a year, many federal judges have uniformly held that marriage is a fundamental right for all, a pair of lawyers said April 8, 2014, during the Civil Rights Summit at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library. Attorney David Boies, speaking after Ted Olson aired a similar point, put it this way: ""Here you have more than 30 federal judges who have considered the issue of gay and lesbian rights since last June. And every one of them--appointed by Republicans, appointed by Democrats, appointed by all of the last four or five presidents--in every area of the country, in Texas to Utah to Ohio to Oklahoma to Michigan, north south east west, every political affiliation, they’ve all ruled the same way. Every one of them has ruled that marriage is a constitutional right and you cannot deprive individual citizens of that right based on their sexual orientation."" We suspect Boies singled out judicial rulings since June 2013 because the U.S. Supreme Court that month overturned the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which had been enacted in 1996 to limit marriage, under federal law, to the union of one man and one woman. Writing for the 5-4 majority in U.S. v. Windsor, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy said the law, known as DOMA, violated the core constitutional principle that people are entitled to equal protection under the law. Kennedy said DOMA’s main purpose was to demean and stigmatize homosexuals, relegating them to second-class status and humiliating the children they are raising. Kennedy concluded there can be no legitimate government purpose for a law intended to ""disparage and to injure."" Did more than 30 federal judges subsequently hold marriage to be a right for all? After asking Boies’ office for his backup information, we turned to Lambda Legal, a gay rights group, for its analysis. Spokesman Tom Warnke emailed us its compendium of pending ""marriage equality"" cases. As of March 6, 2014, according to the breakdown, the marriage restrictions of 28 states were at issue in 55 pending lawsuits--37 in federal court and 18 in state court. Only seven states that don’t currently provide for ""marriage equality"" were lacking legal challenges, according to the document: Alaska, Georgia, Indiana, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. By our read, the breakdown showed several federal judges siding with gay-marriage proponents, though we didn’t see the count getting as high as 30--or even 20. Using the breakdown and news stories we found using the Nexis search tool, we identified favorable rulings by district judges issued from December 2013 through February 2014 in Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Illinois, Texas, Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio: On Dec. 20, 2013, U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby of Utah said the state’s ban on gay marriage ""conflicts with the United States Constitution’s guarantees of equal protection and due process under the law. The state’s current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and, in so doing, demean the dignity of these same-sex couples for no rational reason,"" the New York Times reported in a news story posted online that day. On Jan. 14, 2014, U.S. Senior Judge Terence Kern struck down Oklahoma’s ban on same-sex marriage, saying it ""intentionally discriminates against same-sex couples desiring an Oklahoma marriage license without a legally sufficient justification,"" according to a news story posted online that day by the Daily Oklahoman. On Feb. 13, 2014, U.S. District Judge Arenda Wright Allen of Virginia held the state’s ""marriage laws unconstitutionally deny Virginia's gay and lesbian citizens the fundamental freedom to choose to marry,"" according to a USA Today news story posted the next morning. On Feb. 21, 2014, U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman issued a decision enabling Cook County couples to marry regardless of sexual orientation. In her decision, according to a Chicago Tribune news story posted online that day, Coleman said ""there is no reason to delay further when no opposition has been presented to this court and committed gay and lesbian couples have already suffered from the denial of their fundamental right to marry."" On Feb. 26, 2014, U.S District Judge Orlando Garcia of San Antonio, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, ruled unconstitutional the Texas ban on gay marriage and issued an injunction barring Texas from enforcing its prohibitions on same-sex couples marrying, the Austin American-Statesman said in a news story posted that evening. ""Without a rational relation to a legitimate government purpose, state-imposed inequality can find no refuge in our United States Constitution,"" Garcia held, though he stayed the ruling, enabling the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to weigh in before Texans attempted to wed. On Feb. 27, 2014, U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II of Kentucky threw out part of Kentucky’s marriage restrictions, formalizing his Feb. 12 ruling that Kentucky's ban on same-sex marriages treated ""gay and lesbian persons differently in a way that demeans them,"" Fox News reported. ""Same-sex couples may change their names on official identifications and documents and obtain any other benefits of a married couple in Kentucky,"" the story said, though the ""order doesn't affect a related lawsuit seeking to force the state to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples."" On March 21, 2014, U.S. Senior Judge Bernard Friedman of Michigan overturned the state’s voter-approved bar on gay marriages, saying in his ruling that the limit violated the equal protection clause of the constitution. Lynn Wardle, a Brigham Young University law professor who has advocated that the Constitution leaves it to legislators to stipulate who may marry, emailed us his March 2014 paper on the legal status of marriage around the world, which brought to our attention two more rulings, one of them not to any advocate’s advantage. In a Tennessee case--which gets us to nine federal judges supportive of the legality of same-sex marriage since late 2013--U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger on March 14, 2014, granted a preliminary injunction against the state’s same-sex marriage ban in certain instances, the Tennessean newspaper reported that day. ""At this point, all signs indicate that, in the eyes of the United States Constitution, the plaintiffs’ marriages will be placed on an equal footing with those of heterosexual couples and that proscriptions against same-sex marriage will soon become a footnote in the annals of American history,"" Trauger wrote. By phone, Wardle suggested there has been at least a speed bump among the rulings in that a federal judge in Wisconsin declined to grant plaintiffs a preliminary injunction against the state’s bar on gay marriage, though he said that doesn’t signal she’ll ultimately rule against the plaintiffs. According to an undated web post by Lesbian/Gay Law Notes, published by the the LGBT Bar Association of Greater New York, the Wisconsin judge, Barbara B. Crabb, told plaintiffs that if they withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction, she would set an expedited trial schedule; they did and she did. Our search yielded one ruling by a state appeals court arguably in the spirit of Boies’ claim. According to an Associated Press news story, New Mexico’s Supreme Court legalized gay marriage Dec. 19, 2013, by deeming the denial of marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples in violation of the state constitution’s ""equal protection"" clause. Meantime, Wardle guided us to William C. Duncan, the Utah-based president of the Marriage Law Foundation, which says it provides legal resources to defend and protect marriage between a husband and wife. By email, Duncan said he doesn’t see how Boies’ ""more than 30"" count of federal judges ruling favorably for gay-marriage proponents since June 2013 factually bears out. Duncan specularted that since then, more than 30 cases have been filed challenging state marriage laws. That’s different than what Boies said, no? ""Definitely,"" Duncan said. We failed to connect with Boies while a spokeswoman for his law firm, Dawn Schneider, suggested by email that his statement referred to much more than marriage equality rulings. We sought elaboration and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Boies said that since June 2013, every one of more than 30 federal judges who have considered gay and lesbian rights ""has ruled that marriage is a constitutional right and you cannot deprive individual citizens of that right based on their sexual orientation."" District judges have almost uniformly ruled for gay-marriage plaintiffs in this timeframe, but Boies’ count of such judges is considerably off.  We identified nine federal district judges who have issued such rulings since last June. We rate this claim, which has an element of truth, as Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn says 56 percent of Democrats say 'big government' is 'the biggest threat to our nation's security'
","Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., isn’t as well known nationally as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, or Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. -- two lawmakers who are weighing presidential bids in 2016. But like Cruz and Paul, Blackburn recently trekked to Manchester, N.H., to address the New Hampshire Freedom Summit, a gathering sponsored by the conservative groups Americans for Prosperity and Citizens United. In her speech on April 12, 2014, Blackburn -- like many of her fellow speakers -- took aim at the government and earned applause from the staunch conservatives in the audience. ""Gallup did a survey recently,"" she said, ""and what they found was that 72 percent of all Americans say the biggest threat to our nation's security is big government. That is amazing. Now, the really fascinating part of this is 56 percent of all Democrats say the biggest threat to our nation is big government. Now I’ve got to tell you something -- when the Democrats say the government is too big, we all know the government is too big."" We wondered whether it was true that Gallup found that 72 percent of Americans, and 56 percent of Democrats, ""say the biggest threat to our nation's security is big government."" We didn’t hear back from Blackburn’s office, but we quickly found the study she was referring to. It was a poll taken in early December 2013, which we think qualifies as ""recent."" It has a sampling error of 4 percentage points. The survey asked the Gallup question that’s been asked with identical wording since 1965: ""Which of the following will be the biggest threat to the country in the future -- big business, big labor or big government?"" Gallup reported that 72 percent of all respondents said ""big government,"" calling it ""a record high in the nearly 50-year history of this question. The prior high for big government was 65 percent in 1999 and 2000. Big government has always topped big business and big labor, including in the initial asking in 1965, but just 35 percent named it at that time."" In the December 2013 version of the poll question, Blackburn’s percentages were on target. Here’s the breakdown by party:   Party of survey respondent Big government is biggest threat Big business is biggest threat Big labor is biggest threat Republican 92 percent 4 percent 3 percent Independent 71 percent 20 percent 5 percent Democratic 56 percent 36 percent 6 percent All respondents 72 percent 21 percent 5 percent   Gallup said it expects the results to continue to fluctuate as it asks the question periodically, since both parties tend to be more suspicious of government whenever the opposite party controls the White House. In general, though, Republicans have long been more wary of big government, the data shows. Democratic concern about big government maxed out at 62 percent in 2005, during George W. Bush’s presidency -- a high level, but much lower than the GOP’s current 92 percent rate. But what about Blackburn’s talking point? Gallup’s question gave respondents one of three choices -- big government, big business and big labor. Blackburn didn’t mention that framing, and that’s an important distinction to make. We think most listeners, when hearing someone cite results of a poll about ""the biggest threat to our nation's security"" and ""the biggest threat to our nation,"" would assume that respondents were choosing from a larger universe of possible threats. Yet the way the question was worded prevented respondents from considering any number of possible threats to the nation’s security, ranging from radical Islamism to climate change to a weak economy. Pollster.com co-founder Charles Franklin, a professor of law and public policy and director of the Marquette Law School Poll, agrees that there’s a disconnect between the poll question Gallup asked and the way Blackburn framed it. ""The Gallup question is not specific as to the nature of the possible threat, and seems to imply one of these three should be selected,"" he said. ""The reason for the threat, or its nature, would almost certainly vary across partisans and lead to very different conclusions as to what should be done."" For instance, a CBS News poll taken in March 2014 asked, ""What do you think is the most important problem facing this country today?"" It left the question open-ended for the respondent to answer. The economy and jobs finished first with 30 percent, followed by health care with 7 percent, the budget with 5 percent, ""President Obama"" with 4 percent, and four topics with 3 percent -- immigration, education, ""miscellaneous government issues"" and religious values. No fewer than 37 percent split their answers among other topics in segments smaller than 3 percent. The economy topped the list in several other versions of the CBS News question asked over the previous year. And Gallup itself has asked a similar open-ended question as well, most recently in June 2013. The question was, ""Looking ahead, what is your greatest worry or concern about the future of the United States?"" The economy finished first with 17 percent, followed by ""the debt/deficit/nation’s finances"" with 11 percent, ""employment/jobs"" with 11 percent, and ""wars/conflicts in other countries"" with 5 percent. The closest category to ""big government"" in this poll was ""government not working for the betterment of the people,"" with 4 percent, and government ""overreach/power"" with 3 percent. Combined, these two categories drew a distinct minority of respondents -- 7 percent, a far cry from the 72 percent ""consensus"" found in the more limited-question poll Blackburn cited. Our ruling Blackburn said a recent Gallup poll found that 72 percent of Americans and 56 percent of Democrats ""say the biggest threat to our nation's security is big government."" She got the numbers right, but the specific poll only offered respondents three options: ""big government,"" ""big business"" or ""big labor."" Her phrasing gives the misleading impression that there is wide consensus -- even among Democrats -- that ""big government"" is the biggest threat to the nation’s security. Other polls, including Gallup’s own, show that when respondents are asked an open-ended question, other issues such as the economy rise to the top of the list. So Blackburn is essentially cherry-picking among polls. Blackburn’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB80D300>],/factchecks/2014/apr/16/marsha-blackburn/gop-rep-marsha-blackburn-says-56-percent-democrats/

Jim DeMint says Wall Street gives much more to Democrats than Republicans
","When Politico Magazine ran an article about Jim DeMint, president of the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, it posed this question with its headline: ""Is Jim DeMint the Most Hated Man in Washington?"" The former U.S. senator from South Carolina, according to the article, had made a sport of bashing fellow Republicans. Four days later, on March 7, 2014, conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes asked the same question of DeMint during an interview on WTMJ-AM (620) in Milwaukee. DeMint called the label a badge of honor. And when the conversation turned to connections between the federal government and big business, he contradicted conventional political wisdom. ""The big Wall Street banks, the big corporations,"" DeMint asserted, give ""many times more"" in political contributions to Democrats than Republicans. The ""many times more"" made us curious. DeMint's take Here's the part of the interview where DeMint made his statement. Sykes: ""It’s an interesting point when we talk about the crony capitalism, because I think that the Left would like people to believe that somehow that big government is a rival to big business. And your point is, no, in fact, big business likes big government, big government likes big business and they conspire together against the little guy. ""You are describing crony capitalism here. But isn’t this kind of a problem that conservatives and Republicans have faced -- that, particularly in 2012, the Left rather successfully characterized conservatives as the party of big business, as the party of that kind of crony capitalism. What do Republicans and conservatives need to do to shake that image?"" DeMint: ""Well, it’s so false. I mean, it amazed me while I was in Congress to see the big Wall Street banks, the big corporations -- they give more to Democrats, many times more, than they do to Republicans because the big government, and the more it grows, the more it advantages them."" DeMint essentially made a present-tense claim, but he also referenced his time in Congress --  he served in the Senate from January 2005 until April 2013, when he left for the Heritage Foundation. We’ll also note that the context of his remarks were of all Washington, not just the House or Senate. So, we will evaluate contributions going back to 2005 to see if Democrats received ""many more times"" in political contributions than Republicans from both groups: Wall Street banks and corporations. DeMint’s evidence  When we requested information to back the Wall Street banks part of DeMint’s claim, Heritage Foundation spokesman Jim Weidman cited several articles, most of which highlighted the fund-raising success of Barack Obama, both during his run as the Democratic presidential candidate in 2008 and his run for re-election in 2012. None of the articles, however, said that on the whole Democrats were raising several times as much money as Republicans in the financial sector. For the corporations part of DeMint’s claim, a 2008 article said that for the first time in a decade, corporations were spending more money to elect Democrats than Republicans. But again, no evidence that Democrats were collecting many times more in donations than Republicans. Some of the articles DeMint cited quoted figures from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which runs the OpenSecrets.org website to track political donations. The center is a widely quoted authority. Let’s see what they have. Digging into the data Here are breakdowns of the center’s data over the past five two-year election cycles, dating back to when DeMint first entered the U.S. Senate in 2005. Cycles begin with an odd-numbered year. So, the 2006 cycle encompasses 2005 and 2006, 2008 encompasses 2007 and 2008, etc. Wall Street, or Wall Street banks, are not a specific category of donors. But the center told us that people interested in political contributions from Wall Street typically look at three categories: securities and investment, hedge funds and commercial banks. Securities & Investment Election cycle Donations to Democrats Donations to Republicans 2006 $42.3 million $37.1 million 2008 $100.5 million $74 million 2010 $49.1 million $50.8 million 2012 $59.3 million $130.9 million 2014 $17.6 million $30 million   So, in securities and investment, Democrats led Republicans in two of the five cycles, but Republicans led in the three most recent cycles. And the largest margin for Democrats was 58 percent to 42 percent in 2008 -- nowhere near the ""many times more"" DeMint claimed. The largest for Republicans was 69 percent to 31 percent in 2012. Hedge Funds Election cycle Donations to Democrats Donations to Republicans 2006 $4.17 million $1.44 million 2008 $13.3 million $6.6 million 2010 $5.88 million $6.4 million 2012 $4.06 million $12.5 million 2014 $1.75 million $3.69 million In hedge funds, Democrats did have nearly a 3-to-1 advantage -- 74 percent to 25 percent in 2006. But that is just one cycle, dating back eight years. As in the much larger securities and investment category, Republicans led in the three most recent cycles. The Republicans’ best margin was 75 percent to 25 percent in 2012. Commercial Banks Election cycle Donations to Democrats Donations to Republicans 2006 $9.91 million $15.8 million 2008 $18.5 million $19.9 million 2010 $8.28 million $13.6 million 2012 $10.7 million $26.4 million 2014 3.3 million $7.63 million Democrats didn’t lead in the commercial banks category in any of the five election cycles. As for calculating corporation money, that is more complicated. The broadest classification of political donors separates them into business, labor, or ideological interests. according to the Center for Responsive Politics. ""Business"" contributions from individuals are based on the donor's occupation/employer. Since nearly everyone works for someone, and since union affiliation is not listed on FEC reports, totals for business are somewhat overstated, while labor is understated. Still, the base of large individual donors is predominantly made up of business executives and professionals. Contributions under $200 are not included in these numbers, as they are not itemized. Here’s a breakdown for total business contributions -- from individuals and political action committees: Business Election cycle Donations to Democrats Donations to Republicans 2006 $510.4 million $645.1 million 2008 $1.1 billion $917.4 million 2010 $654.6 million $632.1 million 2012 $883.4 million $1.27 billion 2014 $228.5 million $316.4 million 
There’s a similar pattern here, with Republicans leading in the two most recent election cycles and three of the five cycles overall. The Democrats’ best edge was 55 percent to 45 percent in 2008, far from even a 2-to-1 margin. The Republicans’ best advantage was 59 percent to 41 percent in 2012. Our rating DeMint said that the ""big Wall Street banks, the big corporations"" give ""many times more"" political donations to Democrats than Republicans and he referred to his time in the U.S. Senate from 2005 to 2013. Democrats raised nearly three times more than Republicans in one financial sector in one election cycle. But for the most part, when they led their margins were much smaller. And in recent cycles, Republicans have led in money from Wall Street and business. We rate DeMint’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB845B00>],/factchecks/2014/apr/16/jim-demint/not-many-times-more-democrats-sometimes-do-raise-m/

Austin area slips to No. 5 among major metro areas in number of young adults flocking to live there
","Former Austin Mayor Will Wynn, who often speaks on urban growth, suggested that Austin’s attractiveness to retirees and young Americans helps explain demand for downtown housing. ""As our society ages, and as boomers start retiring by the millions, we’re going to see a dramatic increase in the demand for dense urban multifamily housing, with a broad mix of uses nearby,"" Wynn told the Austin American-Statesman for a March 30, 2014, news story headlined ""Austin’s rebuilding boom."" ""Couple that with the fact that more 25- to 34-year-olds are moving to Austin than any other city in America,"" Wynn said, ""and you’ve got yourself a hell of a strong demand for urban housing. I tell people that by any way you possibly measure it — quality of life, public safety, environmental sustainability, public health and fitness, economic — mixed-use density is literally the answer."" Density preferences aside, is Wynn right that more young adults are moving to Austin than to any other U.S. city? Wynn recalls a newspaper story By phone and email, Wynn said he learned of Austin’s draw from a Statesman news story citing U.S Census Bureau research. He didn’t have the story handy, but we found a March 30, 2013, Statesman news story stating that analyses of U.S Census Bureau data by William Frey, a senior demographer at the Brookings Institution, found that from 2009 through 2011, the Austin metro area drew more Americans in the cited age span than any other U.S. city--just as the area did the previous three years, the story said. Frey, the newspaper said, measured rates for annual average net migration (including people who left Austin) of young adults ages 25 to 34 and young adults with college degrees. ""Austin hits the trifecta,"" Frey said then. ""It's got jobs, cachet, it's got people who see that it's a pathway to careers, either because they go there to get an education or to use an education."" Frey further said jobs typically are the top reason people move. Twenty-somethings traditionally have the highest rates of mobility, and college graduates typically are more willing to move out of state for jobs because they tend to compete for them in national markets, Frey said then. Updated analysis places Austin-Round Rock fifth But there's been a change in the rankings, according to Frey’s Nov. 15, 2013, analysis of more recent census data. The Austin-Round Rock metro area placed fifth among 51 major metro areas as a draw on ""millennials,"" adults in the cited age group, from 2009 through 2012, according to a chart posted online by Brookings. Over those three years, the Austin-Round Rock area had an average annual gain of 8,061 25- to 34-year-olds, Frey wrote. Washington, D.C., ranked first among major metro areas with an average annual gain of 12,583 people in the age group, he wrote. Also, the Denver, Portland, Ore., and Houston areas netted greater gains than the Austin area, according to Frey’s breakdown. On the Brookings site, Frey described the D.C. results as a ""renewal of young adults in the post-recession period… compared to the loss of young adults during the recession. The existence of both government and non-government employment opportunities in a highly educated ‘millennial friendly’ environment make the nation’s capital an attractive destination until migration flows to a broader group of areas emerge. ""A few other areas, including San Francisco and Minneapolis, have showed a rising post-recession young adult boom as well,"" Frey wrote. His chart shows the San Francisco area ranked sixth among major metro areas with an average annual gain of 7,688 such young adults in the three years. The Minneapolis area, 11th among major metros, had an average annual gain of 3,708 adults in the age group, according to the chart. Researcher says No. 5 isn't so bad To our inquiry, Frey said by email that while Austin’s rank fell between the cited time periods, there is another way to compare--by the rate of change in such adults settling in major metro areas. By that measure, Frey added, the Austin-Round Rock area’s 2.7 net gain per 100 25- to 34-year-olds placed it second among major metros only to the Denver area, which had a 3.0 rate, he said. Still, Frey said he considers numeric gains to be a more accurate measure of where migrants are going. Numeric gains, he said, are ""not affected by the size of the destination population  In other words, among all the places in the country, which places are gaining the biggest aggregate numbers of migrants? The rate, is more of an ‘impact’ measure: how are recent migrants affecting the destination population?"" Generally, Frey said, the Austin area ""has both educational and employment opportunities relevant to young people who are looking to advance -- especially during a period when many other places have taken sharp employment hits. Even if young people coming to Austin are not getting their dream jobs right away, they will be networking with others who might make that happen. This will not be the case in many other places."" We wondered why Austin’s rank slipped. Frey said that as the economy ""slowly revives elsewhere, there will  be competitors, but being number two or number five"" isn’t bad, he wrote. Wynn, apprised of the Austin area’s latest ranking, speculated by email that Austin by itself, rather than the metro area, draws more young adults than any other U.S. city. Our ruling Wynn said more 25- to 34-year-olds are moving to Austin than any other city in America. Wynn did not offer nor did we find data specific to individual cities. But four major metro areas, led by Washington, D.C., netted more new residents in the cited age group in the latest three years checked by Brookings demographer James Frey. The Austin area ranked fifth among the nation’s major metros. We see no basis for currently declaring Austin No. 1, but Wynn's claim has an element of truth; the Austin area was the biggest draw for young adults in some recent three-year periods. We rate his statement as Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

DeMint: People of faith did more to end slavery than the federal government
","Historians study the past so they can understand it. But when pundits start talking history, you can bet that they are likely using the past to talk about the present. A new book by former Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., features his conversations with average Americans about the country’s founding principles. DeMint now heads the Heritage Foundation, a leading conservative think tank and advocacy group. Christian radio host Jerry Newcombe had DeMint on his show ""Vocal Point"" to talk about that book Falling in Love With America Again. DeMint defined conservatives as people who want to retain principles that have proven to move the country forward. The conversation turned to the Civil War and whether that showed that the nation’s founding guidelines didn’t always produce good results. DeMint argued that the Civil War vindicated conservative principles. He first credited the Constitution for leading to the end of slavery, then he took a different tack. ""But a lot of the move to free the slaves came from the people, it did not come from the federal government,"" DeMint said. ""It came from a growing movement among the people, particularly people of faith, that this was wrong... So no liberal is going to win a debate that big government freed the slaves."" We thought we should check with historians to see whether a lot of the move to free the slaves came from people of faith rather than the federal government. There are two elements to run down -- the role of Washington and the role of religion. We contacted the Heritage Foundation for information that would back up both parts of DeMint’s statement. DeMint himself was unavailable and a spokeswoman sent us material only about the role of religion. The federal role Eric Foner, professor of history at Columbia University and a leading Civil War scholar rejected DeMint’s conclusion and invited him to attend the class he is teaching this semester. ""He will learn that the federal government was central to emancipation,"" Foner said. ""The Second Confiscation Act, Emancipation Proclamation, and Thirteenth Amendment originated with the federal government, not to mention the role of the army in freeing slaves. Of course, many other actors were involved, not least slaves themselves who seized freedom. But it was a context created by the federal government -- the war -- that enabled them to do so."" The Second Confiscation Act of 1862 declared that the federal government would seize the slaves of any rebel and they ""shall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude, and not again held as slaves."" The Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, declared that slaves in the Confederate states -- but not states loyal to the Union -- ""are, and henceforward shall be free."" The Thirteenth Amendment, passed while the fighting still raged and ratified about six months after it ended, declared that ""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States."" Another prominent Civil War researcher, Bruce Levine, a historian at the University of Illinois, said DeMint was ""mixing apples and pears."" ""It was one, very important, thing to advocate abolition,"" Levine told PunditFact. ""It was another thing to legislate and impose it. It was obviously the federal government that actually did decree and enforce the abolition of slavery, first of all through the Union war effort and finally through enforcement of the thirteenth amendment."" Faith and slavery The role of faith is a complicated picture, more nuanced than what DeMint described. His office pointed us to an interview with Rob Rapley, the writer of a PBS series on the abolitionists. ""Every one of the abolitionists was shaped very much by their faith,"" Rapley said. ""In fact, they would have defined themselves first by their faith before any other category."" The historians we reached, and others whose work we read, don’t share such a monolithic view of the abolitionists. ""White abolitionists included people who were less influenced by religious than by secular outlooks,"" Levine said. ""The earliest and most determined enemies of slavery were African-Americans themselves, some of whom were pronouncedly religious and some were not."" Still, the majority of the leaders of the American Anti-Slavery Society, a powerful voice for emancipation in the decades before the war, identified with some branch of faith. They drew their inspiration from the Bible.   In 1845, two theologians debated the biblical view on slavery. Jonathan Blanchard spoke for the abolitionist position. ""Abolitionists take their stand upon the New Testament doctrine of the natural equity of man,"" Blanchard said. ""The one-bloodism of human kind [from Acts 17:26]: -- and upon those great principles of human rights, drawn from the New Testament, and announced in the American Declaration of Independence, declaring that all men have natural and inalienable rights to person, property and the pursuit of happiness."" Whatever the specifics on the abolitionists, DeMint made a broader point. He said that faith powered a growing movement among people to free the slaves. Even the source his office sent us reveals that faith cut both ways. While it fueled those who condemned slavery, the Bible was also the bulwark for the most ardent defenders of slavery. Rapley talked about a Christian woman abolitionist who made her appeal directly to Southern women. ""She thought that if the women of the South turned against slavery, it would lead very quickly to the end of slavery, that men would follow suit,"" Rapley said. ""That was roundly rejected. The gentle appeal to her kinfolk resulted in a violent backlash."" Manisha Sinah, adjunct professor of history at the University of Massachusetts, said the religious justification for slavery was well formed. ""The defense of slavery in the Southern states, especially South Carolina, rested on a Biblical  -- fundamentalist and literal reading of the Bible -- argument,"" Sinah said. There are many examples of this. Presbyterian minister James Henley Thornwell, a co-founder of the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America, wrote, ""Certain it is that no direct condemnation of slavery can anywhere be found in the Sacred Volume. The master is nowhere rebuked as a monster of cruelty and tyranny; the slave is nowhere exhibited as the object of peculiar compassion or sympathy."" Thornwell declared that the church could never go beyond what the Bible said. ""And apart from the Bible she can never speak. Her only argument is, Thus it is written."" According to John Kaufman-McKivigan, professor of history at Indiana University, Southern ministers favored one line above all others. ""Almost invariably, these writers noted that Saint Paul in several of his epistles, admonished slaves to be obedient to their earthly masters,"" McKivigan wrote. Paul’s words were, ""Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord."" Some in the North also believed that slavery was divinely ordained. Nathan Lord, who was president of Dartmouth College from 1828 to 1863, ""warned that any human reproach to the institution of slaveholding was ‘dishonorable to God and subversive to his government,’"" McKivigan wrote.""Despite the efforts of thousands of antislavery men and women, both inside and outside the churches, all but a few small denominations balked at a commitment to uncompromised abolitionist principles and programs."" Our ruling DeMint said that the federal government played less of a role in the freeing of the slaves than did a movement among people, especially those of faith. DeMint has a point that people of faith played a part in supporting the end of slavery. But the historical record is clear that people of faith also played a role in trying to defend slavery. More critical, leading historical scholars we consulted were unanimous that the federal government was the necessary and decisive force that ended slavery. DeMint's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA4E4C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/15/jim-demint/demint-people-faith-did-more-end-slavery-federal-g/

It takes Americans 6.1 billion hours to prepare their taxes, says Virginia Foxx
","Tax day has come around again, and with it a startling claim about the amount of time Americans spend doing their taxes each year. According to U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., it takes United States taxpayers a total of 6.1 billion hours to file their taxes. That adds up to more than 695,000 years. ""6.1 Billion hours a year, just to figure out how much money the government is going to take,"" she said in a post on Twitter. We had to check to see if this number could possibly be accurate. According to Foxx’s office, the number comes from the Taxpayer Advocate Service’s 2013 report to Congress, which tackled the issue of the complexity of the U.S. tax code. ""In 2012, the National Taxpayer Advocate has designated the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as one of the most serious problems facing taxpayers,"" the report reads. ""The existing code, by our count, has reached nearly four million words and imposes unconscionable burden on taxpayers. Our analysis of IRS data indicates that individuals and businesses spend about 6.1 billion hours a year complying with tax-filing requirements."" It’s important to note that the report comes to the number by calculating the estimated combined time businesses and individuals spend filing taxes, not just that of private citizens. The Taxpayer Advocate Service is an independent group within the Internal Revenue Service that is tasked with helping ""taxpayers resolve problems with the IRS and recommend changes that will prevent the problems."" The number was calculated by multiplying the number of times each type of tax form was filed in 2010 by the amount of time the IRS estimates it takes to complete each form, according to Ken Drexler, a media relations officer at the Taxpayer Advocate Service. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires federal agencies to estimate the amount of time it takes to fill out a given piece of paperwork. ""It’s the best number you can come up with, but it’s not necessarily a number you would take to the bank,"" Drexler said, noting it would take longer for someone unfamiliar with a form to complete it than someone who has done so many times before. Accountants and tax professionals, for example, could fill out the forms faster than an average filer. In other words, the estimate might have flaws, but it is the best guess as to the time it takes for businesses and individuals to fill out tax paperwork. In a 2011 report, the Laffer Center for Supply Side Economics further broke down the 6.1 billion hour figure, finding that individuals spend 3.16 billion of those hours filling out tax forms, while businesses clock in at 2.94 billion hours. The estimate has remained the same since 2010. In 2009, the Taxpayer Advocate Service concluded Americans spent a whopping 7.6 billion hours completing the forms. Our ruling  Foxx said, ""6.1 billion hours a year, just to figure out how much money the government is going to take.""   The number came from the Taxpayer Advocate Service’s 2013 report to Congress, which stated that  individuals and businesses spent 6.1 billion hours preparing their taxes.   It’s important to note that the figure is an estimate. It comes from taking the number of tax forms filed in the last year and multiplying it by the IRS’s estimate of the time it takes to prepare the forms. Foxx’s larger point, that it takes a very long time for Americans to comply with filing their federal taxes, is accurate. The number is an estimate, but it’s from a credible, independent report. We rate this statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAABB80>],/factchecks/2014/apr/15/virginia-foxx/it-takes-americans-61-billion-hours-prepare-their-/

Charlie Crist implemented Jeb Bush’s A+ Plan on education, group says
","Gov. Rick Scott isn’t the only one attacking presumptive gubernatorial rival Charlie Crist. An outside group called Progressive Choice Florida has taken a few shots as well -- although there’s some question as to which side the group is on. In a flier that appeared in Florida mailboxes around March 30, the group attacks Crist’s history as a GOP member, saying ""Conservative Republican Charlie Crist is no friend of progressive Democrats."" It then lists several examples: ""Charlie Crist’s record proves he is … -- Pro-life -- NRA A+ rated -- ‘Chain Gang Charlie’ -- Implemented Jeb Bush’s A+ Plan -- Signed petition banning gay marriage"" Interesting to note is the mystery over exactly who funds Progressive Choice, the Florida chapter’s parent organization. It claims on a bare bones website that the larger group is ""a diverse coalition of fair-minded, forward-thinking individuals and organizations advocating for leadership that stands firm on progressive principles and genuinely reflects the interests of all progressives across the nation."" The site also lists the group as ""a 501(c)(4) social welfare advocacy organization."" There has been some speculation that Progressive Choice is a GOP front funded to draw Democratic voters away from Crist, particularly in the upcoming primary against Nan Rich. The group is not yet listed with the Federal Election Commission or the Florida Division of Elections, so contributions so far are untraceable. The mailer lists a Washington P.O. box and says the mailers were sent from Orlando. We’ve dealt with some of those claims before, but the part about Bush’s education plan gave us pause. Then we remembered that before he was governor, Crist was education commissioner. We dug into the archives to find out the whole story. The A+ Plan Bush floated the idea of overhauling Florida education standards during his 1998 campaign, crafting a plan with then-Education Commissioner Frank Brogan, who was his running mate. The plan suggested expanding the use of the Florida Comprehensive Achievement Test, which at the time was new and administered to fourth-, eighth- and 10th-graders. Student test performance (along with attendance and violence rates, and graduation rates at high schools) would be used to give schools a letter grade of A, B, C, D or F. The proposal rewarded with monetary bonuses schools that earned an A, or improved their grade in a year. Failing schools had two years to improve or would be turned over to the state. The state could then change school staff and implement changes as it saw fit. Students at F schools could transfer to private schools with taxpayer-funded vouchers. Critics were especially vocal about the vouchers, saying it would take much-needed funding away from public schools. The use of standardized test scores also was controversial. Bush was elected and announced his A+ Plan for Education his first month in office. This version required annual FCAT testing for grades 3 through 10 each year, with a passing grade required for promotion. The grading and voucher components remained, with higher school grades resulting in more funding. The Republican-controlled Legislature approved the plan in 1999. Enter Education Commissioner Crist. Crist won a statewide election for the post after Tom Gallagher, who became commissioner in 1999, resigned to run for U.S. Senate in 2000. Crist took office in 2001 and served until 2003, when the elected Cabinet post changed to an appointed position under a new law. One of Crist’s duties was to follow the education agenda set by Bush and the Legislature before Crist took office. His campaign acknowledged that Crist put Bush’s plan into action. ""Charlie was education commissioner from 2001-2003, so of course he would be responsible for implementing A+,"" campaign spokesman Steve Geller told PolitiFact Florida in an email. ""A+ was passed by the Florida Legislature ... and any education commissioner would have had to implement these plans."" But did he support the plan he was putting into effect? Progressive Choice certainly thinks so. Jamie Fontaine-Gansell, a Progressive Choice spokeswoman, cited a 2000 Orlando Sentinel voter’s guide article in which candidate Crist said, ""I am an ardent supporter of Gov. Jeb Bush's A+ plan, which provides for an even balance of testing and accountability and has proven to improve performance in our public schools."" Then-Attorney General Crist tripped over standardized testing while running for governor in 2006, most notably being ridiculed for telling the Palm Beach Post he didn’t know what time of year the FCAT was administered to students, or even what a passing score was. He also waffled on strict education standards. ''I think it's important, as we make these decisions regarding education, we're willing to be flexible,'' he told the Miami Herald in 2006. ""I'm willing to be flexible as it relates to the timing (of the FCAT), as it relates to the subject matter, as it relates to how students are prepared for the test. But I think it's important to test."" During his current run for governor, Crist said he supported new Common Core standards and focusing on teacher support, spending most of his time bashing Scott’s early record of cutting school funding after Crist left office in 2011. Standardized testing hasn’t been a major talking point, but he hasn’t specifically opposed it, either. Meanwhile, Florida still embraces testing and its grading program, though it is considering new programs and testing regimes. Current Education Commissioner Pam Stewart this year suggested simplifying the process, focusing on new math and language arts parameters, and a new standardized test already being adopted. Stewart in February proposed a system based on a combination of test scores, grade level performance, graduation rates and college credit or industry certifications. She also wanted to get rid of monetary bonuses and penalties. It’s currently on the agenda in Tallahassee. Our ruling Progressive Choice Florida said Crist ""implemented Jeb Bush’s A+ Plan."" Since Crist was education commissioner after the plan was passed by the Legislature, that’s to be expected. When we went back to see if Crist approved of the plan’s details, he said he did. He has been a supporter of the FCAT and how it’s been used to grade schools.

In Colorado Senate race, Cory Gardner says Mark Udall 'passed Obamacare with his vote'
","The race for a U.S. Senate seat representing Colorado is one of the most closely watched of the 2014 election. And like other Democrats around the country, incumbent Mark Udall is taking heat for his vote in favor of the Affordable Care Act. In a Fox News interview on March 31, 2014, Udall’s likely Republican rival, U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner, said Udall cast the vote that made the bill now commonly called ""Obamacare"" law. ""And 335,000 Coloradans lost their health insurance, had their health insurance canceled because of Mark Udall's vote, a vote that decided Obamacare,"" Gardner told Fox host Neil Cavuto. ""He passed Obamacare with his vote."" This is far from the first time a politician has claimed that an opponent’s vote was the deciding vote for the controversial health care bill. Still, we thought we’d check to see whether Udall’s situation was different in any way. We have checked many claims that different senators were ""the deciding vote."" Ken Cuccinelli said in November 2013 that U.S. Sen. Mark Warner cast the deciding vote on the Affordable Care Act. An ad in Florida made the same claim about Sen. Bill Nelson, while another made the claim about Udall’s colleague from Colorado, Sen. Michael Bennet. We’ve also looked into the same allegation coming from candidates in Ohio and New Hampshire. All of these senators were inaccurately accused of casting the ""deciding"" vote. (We should note that PolitiFact Virginia also looked at an instance where the statement about a critical vote was more carefully phrased, and that earned Mostly True.) As we have in the past, we’ll note that the first Senate vote relevant to the issue came on Dec. 23, 2009. The vote was needed to overcome a filibuster and end debate on the bill, in order to bring it to a vote for final approval. Senate rules require 60 senators to approve such a motion. This vote received exactly the number of supporters necessary to defeat the filibuster, so having just one fewer vote in support would have indeed been insufficient to pass the Affordable Care Act the next day. Udall voted with the rest of his party to overcome the filibuster. ""When a bill passes by just one vote, every single senator who voted for it bears responsibility for its passage,"" said Alex Siciliano, a spokesman for Gardner. ""Sen. Udall cannot duck this fact. Without his 'yes' vote, Obamacare would not be law today, and 335,000 Coloradans would not have had their health insurance cancelled."" Still, it’s hard to say that his vote was any more important than those of the other 59 senators who approved the motion, particularly because his vote was not up for grabs until the last moment. He consistently sided with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., in votes relating to the health care law, and he offered several amendments to the bill either as a sponsor or a co-sponsor. By contrast, then-Sen. Ben Nelson was widely considered a holdout whose late-in-the-game announcement of support was key to the vote’s success. The second important vote, on Dec. 24, 2009, passed the original version of the Affordable Care Act. This was less of a challenge, since the bill only need a majority of senators to pass. In the end, 60 voted for it, meaning any 10 senators could have been responsible for the bill’s passing. Finally, on March 25, 2010, the Senate held a vote that officially approved the bill after it had been passed by the House. Udall supported the bill along with 56 other senators, again making it all but impossible to say whether his was the vote that made the difference. Our ruling Gardner said Udall ""passed Obamacare with his vote."" This statement has an element of truth to it, since without Udall’s vote in favor, the bill would not have been able to come up for a vote on Dec. 24, 2009. However, this ignores the other 59 senators who also voted to end debate -- and the exact same thing could be said about them. Because Udall had consistently sided with the Democratic leadership in votes related to the act, he was not among the handful of undecided senators who Reid had to wrangle as the vote was approaching. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB9DB0C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/15/cory-gardner/colorado-senate-race-cory-gardner-says-mark-udall-/

As an example, Block cites what he says is a high percentage of workers who go on disability. ""Nearly 9 percent of covered employees go out on short term disability every year, with an average outage from work of almost 12 weeks each,"" he says on his campaign website. ""These are very high utilization rates, and would either indicate that Rhode Island has a very sick workforce or that the program has some systemic problems [that] need to be addressed."" Whether the system is well-run or not is a matter of opinion. But we decided to see if his statement about how many workers go out on disability is accurate. We looked at some of this back in July, when we checked a claim by state Rep. Patricia Morgan that used Block’s numbers to compare Rhode Island and New Jersey’s TDI usage rates. Block’s campaign said his source for the 9-percent figure is the 2011 annual report of the state Department of Labor and Training, which administers the temporary disability program. According to the department’s website, Rhode Island’s TDI system was the first in the nation. It collects taxes, 1.2 percent on the first $61,400 a worker earns, and uses that money to pay benefits to others who miss at least seven consecutive days of work because of a medical condition, certified by a doctor. TDI benefits aren’t taxable.    The DLT’s annual report lists the number of eligible claims filed with the program each year, the net amount paid and the number of employees in the state who were supporting the program by paying TDI taxes. Block took the total number of 2011 eligible claims, 35,836, and divided it by the number of workers paying TDI taxes, 393,000, which produces a result of 9.1 percent. When we checked with the DLT,  spokeswoman Nikki Armstrong said the number of claims represents how many requests for payment the program received. But that doesn’t tell you how many people filed for TDI benefits, because individual employees sometimes make more than one claim in a year. The figure that does is the new claims number, which tells how many people made a first claim on the system in that year. In 2011, that number was 30,953, which was 7.9 percent of the 393,000 people paying into the system, not the ""nearly 9 percent"" Block cited. According to the agency’s 2011 report, the average length of a claim was 11.2 weeks, Block’s ""almost 12 weeks"" claim. But there are more recent numbers than those Block cited. For 2013, slight increases in the number of people paying into the system and slight decreases in the number of new claims dropped that year’s new claims percentage to 7.4 percent, according to the Department of Labor and Training. The average duration of a claim in 2013 went up to 12.2 weeks. Block said his claim was a good-faith calculation based on the best-publicly available data that the Department of Labor and Training had released. The agency’s online report made no distinction between number of claims and number of claimants, he said. ""When we use data to do policy research, we use the data that is made available directly by the appropriate state agency,"" he said. The first-claim number wasn’t in the posted report, he said. Our ruling Ken Block said nearly 9 percent of eligible employees go out on temporary disability each year, for an average of 12 weeks. He fell short on the first part of the claim, which he based on 2011 numbers. As we reported in our item last July, 7.9 percent of covered employees went out on disability in 2011. In 2013, it was 7.4 percent. He was closer on the second part of his claim. In both 2011 and 2013, the average duration of a claim was close to 12 weeks. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EA999C00>],/factchecks/2014/apr/15/kenneth-block/ken-block-says-9-percent-ri-workers-go-short-term-/

Georgia's WIC program ranked 7th largest
","One government program putting food on the table for the needy is the Women, Infants and Children Supplemental Nutrition Program, most often known by the acronym WIC. The program targets low-income, nutritionally at-risk groups -- mostly pregnant women, new moms, babies and children up to age 5. Participants receive vouchers to buy qualifying healthy foods -- such as fruit, vegetables, peanut butter and milk. (No lobster allowed under WIC, unlike the food stamp program. See food stamps Politifact, March 21.) As its name suggests, the WIC program, which is 100 percent federally funded, is meant to supplement what’s already in the pantry. The average WIC participant received $45.47 worth of groceries a month in 2013, probably not enough on its own to keep body and soul together. During the recent General Assembly session, when GOP lawmakers were pushing through a bill to require drug tests of some food stamp recipients, a reader asked for a fact check on WIC. He jogged our memory last week after seeing a blog from the state Department of Public Health, the agency that administers the program. The post stated: ""Georgia has the nation's fifth largest Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Supplemental Nutrition program, serving more than 270,000 mothers, babies and children every day."" ""Could this be true?"" the reader asked. ""Dare I ask what that’s costing us?"" We reached out to Nancy Nydam, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Health. Based on costs, Georgia’s program ranked fifth among the 50 states, the U.S. territories and the District of Columbia for four years, from 2009 to 2012, Nydam said. But that’s no longer the case. New data show that the Georgia program dropped to seventh in the rankings for 2013, she said. (The blogger was going on 2013 projections, not actual data for the year, Nydam said.) The new data, provided by the Department of Public Health, show that, for 2013, Georgia ranked seventh behind: California, $1,095,910,535; Texas, $482,192,108; New York, $445,559,283; Florida, $354,990,320; Puerto Rico, $242,747,993; and Illinois, $215,142,474. Georgia spent about $215.1 million for food and other services for 289,527 WIC recipients, including nutrition and breast-feeding education, and referrals for health and social services, Nydam said. Enrollment in the program was down 14,340 from 2012. It peaked in 2009, as the economy was crumbling, at 323,353, state data show. Costs for the Georgia program fell by more than $59 million, from $274.5 million in 2012, due to a couple of factors, Nydam said. Besides having fewer women and children on the rolls, Georgia has been working with manufacturers to lower the program’s costs for food. As a result, state spending on food for program participants was reduced from $225 million in 2011 to $204 million in 2012 and to $157 million for 2013, state data show. The feds also have pushed states to do more to combat fraud. After it became a stand-alone agency, the Department of Public Health created an inspector general’s office to investigate fraud in the WIC program and developed and issued new WIC vouchers, complete with a foil seal and watermark designed to deter counterfeiting, Nydam said. The inspector general’s office has prosecuted 16 people for WIC vendor fraud, terminated 183 vendors and recouped $17 million as restitution. Our conclusion: The blog statement said Georgia ranks fifth among the states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories based on the cost of its WIC program. That was true for four years, through 2012. Once Politifact inquired, state officials said there was new data showing the state dropped to seventh for 2013. We rate the statement as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7D6F40>],/factchecks/2014/apr/15/georgia-department-public-health/georgias-wic-program-ranked-7th-largest/

NH GOP says Jeanne Shaheen votes with Obama 99 percent of the time
","With midterm elections on the horizon, Republicans have targeted incumbent U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., for her support of President Barack Obama and his health care reform law. Even though Obama won New Hampshire twice, a majority of residents now disapprove of his job performance, and his signature legislative accomplishment -- the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- remains unpopular in the state, according to findings from the WMUR Granite State Poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. The New Hampshire Republican Party released a web video in March 2014 aimed at capitalizing on those trends. Titled ""99 Percent,"" the video asserts that Shaheen consistently supports the president and ""votes with Obama 99 percent of the time."" ""Sen. Shaheen can run, but she can’t hide from her loyal and unwavering support of the Obama-Biden agenda,"" NHGOP Chairwoman Jennifer Horn said in a statement that accompanied the clip. Democrats across the country have been targeted with similar critiques, with varying degrees of accuracy. In 2012, the Ohio Republican Party claimed that Democratic U.S. Sen Sherrod Brown voted with Obama 95 percent of the time. PolitiFact found that claim to be True. In Alaska, one of Sen. Mark Begich’s Republican opponents claimed Begich supported the president’s economic policies 97 percent of the time. That statement earned a Mostly False rating, because the numbers looked at more than just Obama’s economic policies. In reality, most politicians fall in line with the president when their party controls the White House. Still, we decided it would still be useful to dig into Shaheen’s voting record. The 2014 New Hampshire Senate race is shaping up to be a closely watched contest with former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown entering the race on the GOP side. We asked the NHGOP for some evidence to back up their statement about Shaheen’s support for Obama. Executive Director Matt Mowers pointed us toward Congressional Quarterly’s annual presidential position votes report. CQ examines voting patterns for every member of Congress and sorts them in ways that allow comparisons. One of those ways is an annual examination of presidential support, or the number of votes by each lawmaker on bills in which the sitting president has staked a position. The 2013 CQ analysis shows that, out of the pool of votes on which Obama took a clear position, Shaheen’s vote matched the president’s stance 99 percent of the time. We found similar figures across CQ reports since Shaheen took office. CQ put her voting with Obama at least 95 percent of the time each year. Overall, during the five years since Shaheen took office, Shaheen’s votes have aligned with the president’s position 98 percent of the time. That’s pretty close to the figure offered by the state Republican party. However, it’s important to note some limitations of judging Shaheen’s support for the president based solely on the CQ analysis. Shaheen communications director Shripal Shah said the former New Hampshire governor only votes with Obama when it ""makes sense for New Hampshire."" At times, she has broken with the president, and in some cases on issues that have not come to a vote. For instance, Shah noted that Shaheen opposes an Internet sales tax -- something Obama has endorsed. She also spoke out against another round of military base closures, an idea the Obama administration advanced in budget proposals, and opposed a proposal floated by the president to change Social Security benefits. There are also other ways to measure Shaheen’s voting tendencies. OpenCongress, a nonpartisan legislative tracking service, found that in 2013, Shaheen voted with the majority of Democrats 93.1 percent of the time. That’s less frequently than the average Democrat in the Senate, putting her on the bottom half of the list. In October 2013, a column published in The Telegraph of Nashua by veteran New Hampshire political reporter Kevin Landrigan stated that Shaheen ""has had success throughout her political career by carving out issues over which she has crossed party lines to try to get results."" And in June 2013, Shaheen was featured as a ""Bipartisan Champion"" by the Bipartisan Policy Center for her work on energy efficiency legislation. Shaheen’s camp also pointed to the relatively small set of votes considered in the Congressional Quarterly analysis of presidential support. In 2013, for example, the Senate took 291 roll call votes. CQ registers Obama as having taken a clear stance on only 108 of those votes, or about one third. Many were votes on presidential nominations. ""It's disingenuous to draw conclusions about Sen. Shaheen's record by only looking at a small number of votes,"" Shah said. That’s a valid point. But Shaheen didn’t show the same reluctance to evaluate politicians based on presidential support when she first ran for a U.S. Senate seat. During a 2008 debate with then-Sen. John E. Sununu, Shaheen said that Sununu voted with President George W. Bush 90 percent of the time. The NHGOP directed us to a video recording of the debate. Our ruling The New Hampshire Republican Party said that Shaheen votes with Obama 99 percent of the time. Indeed, in 2013, Shaheen took the same position as the president 99 percent of the time when Obama outlined a clear position, based on analysis by Congressional Quarterly. And overall, her votes have aligned with the president’s wishes 98 percent of the time since she took office. We should note that it’s fairly common for a senator to vote in support of a president of the same party and in some cases Shaheen has broken from the President. Still, NHGOP’s claim about Shaheen wasn’t far off. If the party had specified it was referring only to votes in 2013, the advertisement would have been right on the money. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCE7280>],/factchecks/2014/apr/14/new-hampshire-republican-party/nh-gop-says-jeanne-shaheen-votes-obama-99-percent-/

Rep. Morgan Griffith says EPA job growth outstips that of U.S. government
","U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith has long blamed regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency for the decline of the coal industry across the nation and in his Southwest Virginia district. Griffith, R-9th, introduced a bill to cut 15 percent of the EPA’s budget, saying the agency has grown ""out of control."" ""From 1972 until 2011, the number of EPA employees increased by 107 percent while the number of total federal personnel decreased by 15 percent,"" he said on March 25 during testimony before the House Budget Committee. We wondered whether Griffith’s figures are correct. His spokeswoman, Andrea Pivarunas, sent us sources for the numbers. The EPA had a staff of 8,358 in 1972 and it grew to 17,359 in 2011, according to data from the agency. That’s an increase of 107.7 percent -- matching what Griffith said. We should note that EPA dropped to 15,913 employees last year as many cashed in on an early retirement incentive offered to federal workers. So if Griffith had used the the most current data available, the increase since 1972 would have translated to 90.4 percent. The total number of federal employees was 5.2 million in 1972 and 4.4 million in 2011, according to the federal Office of Personnel Management. That’s a decrease of 15.4 percent -- again, what Griffith said. The federal workforce figure requires elaboration because it includes civilians and uniformed military personnel, which have experienced different trends since 1972. Executive branch civilian employees numbered 2.82 million in 1972 and 2.76 million in 2011, a drop of 2.1 percent. Meanwhile, uniformed military personnel numbered 2.36 million in 1972 and 1.58 million in 2011, a decrease of 33.1 percent. So the reduction in federal employees has more to do with a smaller fighting force than with a shrinking bureaucracy. Now, let’s return to the EPA. What accounted for its sharp rise in employment? The answer is that the agency was barely out of infancy in 1972 when Griffith begins his timeline.   The EPA was created on Dec. 2, 1970, to consolidate environmental quality programs in several federal departments. For example, the Interior Department worked on water quality and pesticides, while the Department of Health, Education and Welfare worked on air pollution, and the Food and Drug Administration conducted pesticides research. In areas where the federal government didn’t have oversight, state or local governments were left to fill in the gaps. Congress passed a number of laws in the 1970s that expanded the EPA’s authority:   Clean Air Act to set national air quality, automobile emission and anti-pollution standards Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention to to restrict lead-based paints in government-subsidized housing, cribs and toys Clean Water Act to control discharges of pollution in surface water Dumping Act to control dumping chemicals and material in the ocean waters Safe Drinking Water Act to regulate public drinking water Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to control hazardous waste from creation to disposal Toxic Substances Control Act to cut health risks from synthetic and organic chemicals Superfund Act to identify those responsible for chemical contamination of land and compel them to clean up the contamination ""The 1970s is known as the environmental decade because so much happened so quickly,"" said Daniel Fiorino, director of American University’s Center for Environmental Policy and a former EPA official. The agency started with 4,084 employees in 1970 and grew to 13,078 in 1980. Employment tapered in the early 1980s, but grew again in the 1990s with a sweeping expansion of the Clean Water Act and as concerns emerged about global warming. The EPA peaked in 1999, with 18,110 employees. From 1980 to 2011, employment at the EPA grew by 32.4 percent while the total number of federal employees -- military and civilian -- dropped by 11.3 percent. Our ruling Griffith said, ""From 1972 until 2011, the number of EPA employees increased by 107 percent while the number of total federal personnel decreased by 15 percent."" There are a few minor issues with Griffith’s choice of dates and numbers, but we won’t quibble. The EPA increase would have dipped below 100 percent if Griffith had used the most current employment figures from 2013. On the other had, Griffith could have made the growth sound more dramatic if he had started his comparison in 1970, when the EPA was born. We rate Griffith’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7D6D00>],/factchecks/2014/apr/14/morgan-griffith/rep-morgan-griffith-says-epa-job-growth-outstips-u/
"['Census', 'States', 'Florida', 'Bill Nelson']","
Florida surpassed New York in population, Bill Nelson says
","Hurricane-prone Florida is a populous state that needs a robust National Guard, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., argued during a Senate Armed Services committee hearing about National Guard cuts. Under the Budget Control Act, the Florida National Guard which currently has about 12,000 troops could lose up to 1,000 soldiers and airmen if cuts are distributed evenly across the states. The cuts could start in 2015. As Nelson talked about the need for Guard troops in states that face hurricanes, he snuck in a smidgen of one upmanship over New York. ""My state of Florida is now the third-largest state,"" Nelson said on April 8. ""We have surpassed New York in population. But New York and Florida also have in common the threat of hurricanes."" Do more people live in Florida than New York? We didn’t think our own senator had that right. New York vs. Florida numbers On Dec. 30, the Census Bureau released estimates through July 2013 which showed that New York narrowly held on to its spot as the third most-populous state behind California and Texas. New York had 19,651,127 residents while Florida had 19,552,860. That means that New York has 98,267 more residents than Florida. The next such release of data will be in December. (We will rely on the census to make an apples-to-apples comparison between Florida and New York. However Florida’s office of Economic and Demographic Research has a slightly lower figure for Florida’s population: it placed it at 19,485,270 as of February 2014. The state projects we will surpass the 20 million mark in 2016.) But the story doesn’t end there. The Miami Herald reported on Dec. 30 that demographers said that Florida was on track to soon overtake New York because Florida was growing more quickly. ""It’s quite clear that Florida, in terms of overall population, is going to overtake New York,"" Ira Sheskin, who chairs the Department of Geography and Regional Studies at the University of Miami, told the Miami Herald. ""It won’t take much longer."" Both states have received a steady stream of immigrants, said Stan Smith, of the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Florida. ""But in terms of (domestic) migration, more people leave New York than move into New York,"" Smith told the Miami Herald in December. Tracking when Florida will surpass New York is more than just interesting trivia and bragging rights. Size matters when it comes to doling out billions of dollars in federal money. So why did Nelson think it had already happened? Nelson’s spokesman pointed to a March article in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune about new growth estimates released for the Sarasota, Manatee and Charlotte counties for July 2010 through July 2013. The article stated: ""As a result, Florida last month likely edged New York to become the third most populous state in the nation, based on bureau estimates and a Herald-Tribune analysis of the data,"" the article stated. ""During that three-year period, Florida’s population grew by an average of 645 people daily, while New York’s grew by some of 231 a day."" ""If you look at the recent trends, it certainly appeared that Florida would pass New York somewhere between July 2013 and June of 2014,"" Smith told the Herald-Tribune. We sent Nelson’s statement and the Herald-Tribune article to a few demographers in Florida and New York and asked if they thought Nelson could declare Florida already in the third place spot. All of the experts told us that we would need to wait for official numbers from the census. ""Florida will probably pass New York this year, but there is no guarantee,"" Smith told PolitiFact. ""You will need to wait for proof,"" Andrew Beveridge, a professor at Queens College and an expert on census data, told PolitiFact Florida in an email. ""Maybe something like ‘Most likely.’ "" Whether Florida is now ahead of New York remains unclear, University of Miami demographer Ira Sheskin told PolitiFact Florida in an email. ""Population change is Births - Deaths + In-migration - Out-migration. Florida grew 4 percent from April 1, 2010, to July 1, 2013, and New York at 1.4 percent. So we will eventually overtake New York. But even given that we are 8 months past the last Census Bureau estimate, it is not clear that we have yet surpassed New York."" Amy Baker, the coordinator of Florida’s Office of Economic and Demographic Research, said EDR believes based on its own data that Florida will surpass New York ""sometime in late 2015 or early 2016. If the Census Bureau has a better handle on our growth than we do, the date would be sooner. But even then you would need the next set of census data to confirm."" Our ruling Nelson said, ""My state of Florida is now the third-largest state. We have surpassed New York in population."" Based on official information from the U.S. Census, as of July 2013, New York was in third place in population with about 100,000 more residents than Florida. Demographers have predicted that Florida will soon overtake New York and it’s possible that it has already happened, but demographers said we won’t know for certain until the census releases updated information later this year. We rate politicians’ claims based on information available at the time, so at this point we can’t declare for certain that Florida has inched ahead of New York.

"['Civil Rights', 'History', 'Texas', 'Barack Obama']","
Lyndon Johnson opposed every civil rights proposal considered in his first 20 years as lawmaker
","President Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas was lauded by four successor presidents as a Lincoln-esque groundbreaker for civil rights, but President Barack Obama also noted that Johnson also had long opposed civil rights proposals. ""Now, like any of us, he was not a perfect man,"" Obama said in his April 10, 2014, speech at the Civil Rights Summit at the LBJ Presidential Library. ""His experiences in rural Texas may have stretched his moral imagination. But he was ambitious, very ambitious, a young man in a hurry to plot his own escape from poverty and to chart his own political career. And in the Jim Crow South, that meant not challenging convention. ""During his first 20 years in Congress,"" Obama said, ""he opposed every civil rights bill that came up for a vote, once calling the push for federal legislation a farce and a shame."" On one level, it’s not surprising that anyone elected in Johnson’s era from a former member-state of the Confederate States of America resisted civil-rights proposals into and past the 1950s. But given Johnson’s later roles spearheading civil-rights measures into law including acts approved in 1957, 1960 and 1964, we wondered whether Johnson’s change of course was so long in coming. Johnson initially won election to the U.S. House in 1937, outpacing nine other aspirants on April 10, 1937, to fill the seat opened up by the death of Rep. James P. Buchanan, according to Johnson’s biographical timeline posted online by his presidential library. He advanced to the Senate in the November 1948 election, later landing the body’s most powerful post, majority leader, before resigning after his ascension to vice president in the 1960 elections. So, Obama was speaking to Johnson’s position on civil rights measures from spring 1937 to spring 1957, a stretch encompassing many votes. For this fact check, we asked our Twitter followers (@PolitiFactTexas) for research thoughts. A reader guided us to excerpts of an interview with historian Robert Caro, who has written volumes on Johnson’s life, presented on the Library of Congress blog Feb. 15, 2013. The applicable portion: The nation will be marking the 150th Anniversary of the Civil War. Like Lincoln, Johnson’s true motives on promoting racial equality have been questioned. Have you come to any conclusions about that? Caro: The reason it’s questioned is that for no less than 20 years in Congress, from 1937 to 1957, Johnson’s record was on the side of the South. He not only voted with the South on civil rights, but he was a southern strategist, but in 1957, he changes and pushes through the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction. He always had this true, deep compassion to help poor people and particularly poor people of color, but even stronger than the compassion was his ambition. But when the two aligned, when compassion and ambition finally are pointing in the same direction, then Lyndon Johnson becomes a force for racial justice, unequalled certainly since Lincoln. Similarly, White House spokesman Eric Schultz answered our request for information with emailed excerpts from Means of Ascent, the second volume of Caro’s books on Johnson. The introduction to the book says that as Johnson became president in 1963, some civil rights leaders were not convinced of Johnson’s good faith, due to his voting record. ""He had been a congressman, beginning in 1937, for eleven years, and for eleven years he had voted against every civil rights bill – against not only legislation aimed at ending the poll tax and segregation in the armed services but even against legislation aimed at ending lynching: a one hundred percent record,"" Caro wrote. ""Running for the Senate in 1948, he had assailed President"" Harry ""Truman’s entire civil rights program (‘an effort to set up a police state’)…Until 1957, in the Senate, as in the House, his record – by that time a twenty-year record – against civil rights had been consistent,"" Caro wrote. We found that excerpt in the book as well as these vignettes: --In 1947, after President Harry S Truman sent Congress proposals against lynching and segregation in interstate transportation, Johnson called the proposed civil rights program a ""farce and a sham--an effort to set up a police state in the guise of liberty."" --In his 1948 speech in Austin kicking off his Senate campaign, Johnson declared he was against Truman’s attempt to end the poll tax because, Johnson said, ""it is the province of the state to run its own elections."" Johnson also was against proposals against lynching ""because the federal government,"" Johnson said, ""has no more business enacting a law against one form of murder than against another."" Next, we asked an expert in the offices of the U.S. Senate to check on Johnson’s votes on civil rights measures as a lawmaker. By email, Betty Koed, an associate historian for the Senate, said that according to information compiled by the Senate Library, in ""the rare cases when"" such ""bills came to a roll call vote, it appears that"" Johnson ""consistently voted against"" them or voted to stop consideration. (See detail in her email, here.) Our ruling Obama said that during Johnson’s ""first 20 years in Congress, he opposed every civil rights measure that came up for a vote."" That was the case for Johnson, who broke this pattern by steering passage of civil rights acts starting in 1957. We rate this statement as True.

Handel’s degree claim nearly makes the grade
","Republican U.S. Senate candidate Karen Handel and her supporters have turned GOP rival David Perdue’s remarks about her not graduating from college into a campaign issue she hopes will bring Georgia voters to her side when it’s time to vote on May 20. ""Let's remind David that a lot more defines a person than whether they have a college degree,"" former Georgia Republican Party Chair Sue Everhart was quoted in a Handel campaign email. There was another line in the email from Everhart that we wanted to fact-check. ""David’s either an elitist or just arrogant. But either way, he thinks he’s better than 72 percent of Georgians who did not have the chance to finish college,"" it read. We wondered if that statistic is correct. In this age of parents constantly impressing upon children the importance of a college education, surely more than a scant 28 percent of Georgians finished college. Our research surprised us, but we found Handel’s claim omitted a point. Handel left what she has described as a dysfunctional home when she was 17. Handel finished high school and took some college courses, but never earned a degree. Handel has been chair of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners and was elected Georgia secretary of state. Handel lost the GOP runoff for governor in 2010 to the current occupant of the Governor’s Mansion, Nathan Deal. Handel, who’s been out of politics since then, has struggled to get attention in the crowded GOP U.S. Senate field that includes three congressmen and the deep-pocketed David Perdue, cousin of former Gov. Sonny Perdue. That was until a video of David Perdue’s comments about why he’s the best fit for the Senate surfaced. ""There's a high school graduate in this race, OK? I'm sorry, but these issues are so much broader, so complex,"" Perdue, a former CEO of several major businesses who has bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Georgia Tech, said in the video. Republicans from 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin to former White House press secretary Dana Perino criticized Perdue’s comments. Palin recently made a campaign stop in Georgia and endorsed Handel. ""There are a lot of good, hard-working Americans who have more common sense in their pinkie finger than a lot of those Ivy League pieces of paper up on a wall that represent some elitism,"" Palin said. ""Not all of the time does a college degree matter."" Perdue called Handel to apologize, but her campaign said the apology was owed ""to the many other Georgians he demeaned."" The Handel campaign is hoping Perdue’s comments will propel the campaign’s prospects with what seems to be a large bloc of voters who’ve been in her shoes. So, back to our initial query. We started our research by calling Everhart. She said the numbers came from the Handel campaign, and Everhart trusted the campaign did its homework. ""It did seem high to me,"" Everhart said of the 72 percent claim. ""But there are a lot of people who go to college, but they don’t complete the four years."" Handel campaign manager Corry Bliss said the claim came from Census Bureau data. The federal agency’s statistics show 27.8 percent of Georgians older than 25 have a bachelor’s degree or higher. The national average is slightly higher, at 28.5 percent. Other data supports Handel’s claim. The most recent numbers from the National Center for Educational Statistics show 27.4 percent of Georgians older than 25 have a bachelor’s degree or higher. The national average, according to the chart we reviewed, was 28 percent. These numbers, however, do not include two-year degrees. One U.S. Department of Education chart shows 35.5 percent of Georgians had an associate, bachelor’s degree or higher in 2010. One organization, the Lumina Foundation, cited a 2011 U.S. Census Bureau report that shows 36.4 percent of Georgians have an associate degree or better. The Lumina Foundation, based in Indianapolis, also breaks down the statistics by each Georgia county. Fulton County edged out Fayette County with the highest percentage of graduates, 55.55, according to the numbers. The foundation’s goal is to increase the number of Americans with college degrees to 60 percent by 2025. President Barack Obama has set a more ambitious goal of getting to that mark by the end of the decade. The Education Department says the United States has fallen from first to 16th in the world in the percentage of adults with a college degree. Courtney Brown, the foundation’s director of organizational performance and evaluation, said the U.S. has lagged because it did not put a higher emphasis on higher education. She said the country needs more creative approaches, such as offering credits for learning outside the classroom. Brown said the percentage of Georgians getting a college degree has increased in recent years due to efforts to close the achievement gap between whites and non-white students and legislation such as a bill passed during the recently-completed session to pay full tuition for the state's highest achieving technical college students. To sum up, the Handel campaign gave Everhart information to claim 72 percent of Georgians do not have a college degree. The claim is correct if you solely consider Georgia’s bachelor’s degrees or higher. The percentage of Georgians without degrees is slightly lower once you include those who earned associate degrees. Once you do that, it’s more like 65 percent. There’s a little context missing in the Handel campaign’s claim, but it’s mostly on the mark.
