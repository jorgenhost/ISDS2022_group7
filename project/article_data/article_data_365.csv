Did group get it right by calling caucus socialists?
","
In today’s acerbic political environment, labels are constantly being placed on elected officials to define them as extreme, out-of-touch or just nuts.

Our colleagues at PolitiFact Oregon recently investigated one controversial label placed on several dozen members of Congress since it included two of that state’s representatives.

A Pennsylvania-based group called Sovereign Citizens United claimed on its website that members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus are ""socialists who are openly serving in the U.S. Congress."" The 77-member caucus includes longtime U.S. Rep. John Lewis, a Democrat from Atlanta, and U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat.

The caucus is often characterized as liberal-leaning in news reports. But socialist?

The S-word is overwhelmingly considered a toxic label in American politics. Yet, it is used more frequently these days, most often as a way to demonize liberal politicians.

Socialism is the idea of the government controlling the entire means of production of goods and services for its citizens. That contrasts with liberalism in American politics -- the idea that the government should offer a wide array of programs to help citizens.

The group claimed it had proof to back up its claim, and its online posting was picked up by others. PolitiFact Oregon was interested because of the type of claim that was being made and that it was being circulated by several outlets in different parts of the country.

PolitiFact Oregon was unable to contact Sovereign Citizens United, but we had better luck. Sovereign Citizens United sent us about a dozen e-mails defending its claim.

""The Progressive Caucus in Congress WAS CREATED BY the Democratic Socialists of America,"" they wrote us in one e-mail. ""Because of this tie, any member of Congress who is a member of the Progressive Caucus is indeed arguing with [sic] the Democratic Socialists of America.""

A spokesman for Johnson wondered if Sovereign Citizens United was the same outfit that is occasionally busted for living in spacious vacant or foreclosed homes, because it believes it is immune to federal and state laws and that only people -- not banks -- can own land. So did we. News accounts refer to those suspects as ""Sovereign Citizens."" Sovereign Citizens United lists itself as a group attempting to stop the undermining of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights by ""U.N. globalists."" We couldn’t find any evidence this group was involved in any suspected criminal activity.

So what about the group’s statement concerning the congressmen and the caucus?

Sovereign Citizens United cited a KeyWiki article that claims the DSA helped create the caucus. The group sent us a link to a website with information the group says is evidence that the DSA created the caucus. The website, Sovereignty.net, says the DSA boasts the creation of the caucus.

Not true on both accounts, says Frank Llewellyn, the DSA’s outgoing national director. Brad Bauman, the caucus’ executive director, called the claim ""categorically false.""

""It was not started by any socialist organization. It was not started by any socialists,""Bauman said of the caucus, founded in 1991. ""The fact that anyone would call into question [the caucus members’] patriotism is shocking to me.""

The KeyWiki page has a link to an article on an obscure website that has one sentence that says the DSA helped organize the caucus.

The DSA has a four-page questions-and-answers section that says it works to ""strengthen the [Democratic Party’s] left wing, represented by the Congressional Progressive Caucus."" Sovereign Citizens United points to that quote as proof that the caucus is heavily influenced by the DSA.

""The Congressional Progressive Caucus is by and from the U.S. Socialist party through the DSA,"" they told us.

Llewellyn said that page is old, ""a little ambiguous"" and now probably wouldn’t reference the Democratic Party’s left wing. The DSA, which claims to have about 6,000 members, would prefer an alternative third party that supports its values. Llewellyn said some of its policy differences with the CPC include: 
Llewellyn said there are no members of Congress who are members of the DSA and he rolls his eyes at claims that President Barack Obama is a socialist.

""We have a banner that says ‘Obama is not a socialist, but we are,’ "" Llewellyn said.

In 2009, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a self-described Democratic Socialist, wrote an op-ed in the Huffington Post arguing that no one else in Congress thinks similarly.

Spokespeople for Johnson and Lewis both rejected any claims to being socialists or members of the DSA.

Our ruling

Sovereign Citizens United believes it has evidence that shows the Congressional Progressive Caucus thinks like socialists and is under the thumb of the Democratic Socialists of America. The evidence is rather flimsy and, in some cases, bogus. The DSA doesn’t boast on its website that it created the caucus, as the sovereign group claims.

"['Ohio', 'Elections', 'Marcia Fudge']","
Rep. Marcia Fudge says state-approved voter legislation will unfairly invalidate some ballots
","
A sweeping election reform bill the GOP-controlled Ohio legislature recently passed has stirred widespread opposition. Democrats have even called it the Voter Suppression Bill.

In that spirit, opponents have initiated an effort to repeal the law, House Bill 194, through a voter referendum.

U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, a Democrat from Warrensville Heights, sent an email to her supporters on Aug. 22 asking for help collecting the 231,147 valid signatures of registered voters required to put the law on the ballot in November 2012. The signatures must be submitted by Sept. 29 or the law will take effect.

In her email, Fudge laid out several changes the bill makes that she opposes.

""HB 194, the Voter Suppression Bill, invalidates a vote where a voter properly marks the ballot in support of a particular candidate, but also writes in the name of that same candidate,"" Fudge wrote.

Invalidating a vote, especially when the voter’s intent is clear, definitely is an issue worth examining. So PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Fudge’s claim as she pushes for the law’s repeal.

The section of HB 194 dealing with a redundant write-in vote represents only a small portion of the massive bill. It is clear, however, this piece of the law is not as clear-cut as Fudge conveyed in her email.

The bill defines a ballot as ""contrary to law"" – such ballots are tossed and not counted – ""if the voter marks the ballot for a candidate and also writes in the name of the candidate as a write-in vote,"" according the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission’s analysis of the bill.

However, the bill lays out a scenario in which such a ballot would be counted.

Three conditions must be satisfied. First, the ballots must be centrally counted (we’ll explain this shortly). Next, the write-in name on the ballot must be the same as the candidate marked on the ballot. Finally, at least three of four board of elections members must agree that the name on the ballot is ""identical"" to the name the voter wrote in.

Daniel Tokaji, an election law expert at Ohio State University’s Moritz College of Law, gave us a quick explanation of the first requirement.

He said the reference to centrally counted ballots is another way of referring to absentee ballots. The law singles out absentee ballots because voting machines at the polls are supposed to notify voters if their ballot has a redundant write-in vote.

But some voting machines allow voters to override the notification and submit the ballot with the extra write-in. Those ballots will not be counted, said Matt McClellan, a spokesman at the Ohio secretary of state’s office.

Now to the stickier part.

The elections board in each of Ohio’s 88 counties has four members – two Democrats and two Republicans. If an absentee ballot contains an extra write-in, the bill says three of the four board members must agree that the write-in is ""identical"" to the candidate’s name on the ballot. That means the ballot would not be counted if the board deadlocks.

""We can easily imagine this leading to shenanigans,"" said Tokaji, who has been outspoken in his opposition to HB 194.

Tokaji described a potential situation in which the voter’s intent was clear, but two board members of the same political party refused to agree the write-in vote is identical to the candidate’s name on the ballot.

""Under these circumstances, the ballot would not be counted,"" Tokaji wrote in an email.

The Ohio Democratic Party, which responded for Fudge because the party sent out the email on her behalf, raised similar concerns about the write-in provision of HB 194.

Seth Bringman, a spokesman for the party, wondered if an elections board would consider a write-in identical to the ballot if the voter wrote ""Marsha Fudge"" and the ballot listed her name as ""Marcia L. Fudge.""

""While there are some circumstances in which a vote would count if a voter selected a candidate and also wrote in the name of that same candidate, such a case is the exception under the bill, not the norm,"" Bringman wrote in an email.

Tokaji reached a similar conclusion.

""The bottom line is that in some, but not all, circumstances, a ballot which has both a mark and the name of the candidate written in should be counted. Which is, of course, not to say that it will in fact be counted,"" Tokaji wrote in an email.

That some ballots could be counted, though, is a point of clarification for Fudge’s statement.

Bachmann says Obama 'has virtually no one in his cabinet with private-sector experience'
","
During a visit to a sandwich shop in Jacksonville Beach, Fla., Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., took a shot at the career backgrounds of the officials who comprise President Barack Obama’s Cabinet.

""I want to bring advisers in from labor and from manufacturers and from the service industry and financial services,"" said Bachmann, who’s running for the Republican presidential nomination. ""I want to know what they know, because that's what we've been missing from President Obama. He has virtually no one in his Cabinet with private-sector experience. I want to bring people who know how to create jobs into my administration.""

A reader suggested that we check whether Bachmann is right that Obama ""has virtually no one in his Cabinet with private-sector experience."" As it happens, we analyzed a similar claim 21 months ago and found it False. But we are updating and expanding that assessment here, due to subsequent arrivals and departures from Obama’s Cabinet.

Our original analysis

First, let’s recap what we published in December 2009. It was based on a statement by Glenn Beck, then a Fox News talk show host, on his Nov. 30, 2009, show.

""History has proven over and over again — and so has the post office, for that matter — that government is not the answer,"" Beck said. ""You need to unleash the people. The entrepreneurs. And if you are wondering how it is that the government can't see that — how they can be pondering even bigger stimulus packages as they stare the failure of the first one right in the face — I'll show you. Here are the past presidents and the number of appointees in their Cabinets with private sector experience — folks that have done more than write on the chalkboard; they've been out there, in the real world. Let's compare President Nixon — he's over 50 percent — with President Obama: Under 10 percent of his appointees have any experience in the private sector.""

After some digging, we found that the claim was based on a study by Michael Cembalest, the chief investment officer for J.P. Morgan Private Bank. In a Nov. 24, 2009, column titled ""Obama's Business Blind Spot"" and published on Forbes.com, Cembalest wrote, ""In a quest to see what frame of reference the administration might have on this issue, I looked back at the history of the presidential Cabinet. Starting with the creation of the secretary of commerce back in 1900, I compiled the prior private-sector experience of all 432 Cabinet members, focusing on those positions one would expect to participate in this discussion: secretaries of State; Commerce; Treasury; Agriculture; Interior; Labor; Transportation; Energy; and Housing & Urban Development.""

He continued, ""Many of these individuals started a company or ran one, with first-hand experience in hiring and firing, domestic and international competition, red tape, recessions, wars and technological change. Their industries included agribusiness, chemicals, finance, construction, communications, energy, insurance, mining, publishing, pharmaceuticals, railroads and steel; a cross-section of the American experience. (I even gave [one-third] credit to attorneys focused on private-sector issues, although one could argue this is a completely different kettle of fish.) One thing is clear: The current administration, compared with past Democratic and Republican ones, marks a departure from the traditional reliance on a balance of public- and private-sector experiences.""

In an accompanying chart, Cembalest reported that in the Obama administration, fewer than 10 percent of the Cabinet appointees counted under those rules had private-sector experience. According to the chart, all other administrations going back to Theodore Roosevelt's had rates in at least the high 20s, with the Eisenhower and Reagan administrations approaching 60 percent.

The chart — typically reprinted by itself, without Cembalest's accompanying narrative — circulated in the conservative blogosphere for a couple of days before eventually being picked up by Beck.
 
However, we found that at least three of the nine positions that Cembalest and Beck cited — one-third — were occupied by appointees who had significant corporate or business experience.

• Shaun Donovan, Obama's secretary of Housing and Urban Development, served as managing director of Prudential Mortgage Capital Co., where he oversaw its investments in affordable housing loans.  

• Energy Secretary Steven Chu headed the electronics research lab at one of America's storied corporate research-and-development facilities, AT&T Bell Laboratories, where his work won a Nobel Prize for physics.

• Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, in addition to serving as Colorado attorney general and a U.S. senator, has been a partner in his family's farm for decades and, with his wife, owned and operated a Dairy Queen and radio stations in his home state of Colorado.

All three remain in Obama’s Cabinet.

Three other Obama Cabinet members worked as lawyers for private-sector law firms, most of them with business clients: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Commerce Secretary Gary Locke. And Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner once worked for Kissinger Associates, a consulting firm that advises international corporations on political and economic conditions overseas.

Of these, Clinton, Vilsack and Geithner remain in the Cabinet.

The occupants of the two remaining Cabinet posts cited in Cembalest’s chart did not have significant private-sector experience: Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Both remain in their jobs.

When we tracked down Cembalest to ask about his methodology, he expressed regret that his work had been used for political ends, saying that it was not his intention to provide fodder for bloggers and talk show hosts. He acknowledged fault in missing Salazar's business background, though he downplayed the private-sector experiences Chu and Donovan had -- managing scientific research and handling community development lending, respectively -- saying they did not represent the kind of private-sector business experience he was looking for when doing his study.

""What I was really trying to get at was some kind of completely, 100 percent subjective assessment of whether or not a person had had enough control of payroll, dealing with shareholders, hiring, firing and risk-taking that they'd be in a position to have had a meaningful seat at the table when the issue being discussed is job creation,"" Cembalest told us.

The Cabinet today

Now let’s look at the Cabinet as it is now. To do that, we’ll detail the full list of Cabinet positions, which is broader than the more limited list Cembalest was working with.

Department heads and the vice president always belong in the Cabinet, with other senior positions granted Cabinet rank at the president’s discretion.

In addition to the vice president, the Cabinet includes the secretaries of 15 executive departments: Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Attorney General.

The other positions that hold Cabinet rank under Obama are: White House chief of staff, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, director of the Office of Management & Budget, U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador to the United Nations, and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.

We’ve already noted that Donovan, Chu and Salazar have solid private-sector credentials. To that list, we can add three names:

• Obama’s nominee for Commerce Secretary, John Bryson. Bryson has served as chairman and CEO of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, a major utility.

• White House chief of staff Bill Daley. Daley has served in several top-level positions with JP Morgan Chase, as president of SBC Communications and as president and chief operating officer of Amalgamated Bank of Chicago.
 
• Office of Management and Budget director Jack Lew. Lew, a longtime senior federal manager, has also served as managing director and chief operating officer of Citi Global Wealth Management  and later Citi Alternative Investments.

We can also add six names to the list of those who have worked as lawyers or consultants for private-sector companies. Though Cembalest treated them as different from other private sector workers, we see no reason to:

• Vice President Joe Biden. Biden, something of an entrepreneur, founded his own law firm, Biden and Walsh, early in his career, and it still exists in a later incarnation, Monzack Mersky McLaughlin and Browder, P.A. Biden also supplemented his income by managing real estate properties, including a neighborhood swimming pool. Of course, he later became a long-serving U.S. senator from Delaware.

• Attorney General Eric Holder. Holder, a former judge and deputy attorney general, has also worked as a litigation partner at the law firm Covington & Burling LLP.

• Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Panetta, a former Member of Congress and Central Intelligence Agency director, worked in private practice as a lawyer for five years.

• Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. Napolitano, the former two-term governor of Arizona, also practiced law in Phoenix with the firm Lewis and Roca.

• U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk. Kirk, the former mayor of Dallas, has also worked as a partner in the Texas-based international law firm Vinson & Elkins.

• U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice. Rice, a veteran of the State Department and foreign-policy think tanks, worked early in her career as a management consultant with McKinsey & Co., which advises corporations on how to run their businesses more effectively.

Finally, we can add five names to the list of Cabinet members without any significant private-sector experience: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Education Secretary Arne Duncan, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, and Council of Economic Advisers nominee Alan Krueger. (We will note, however, that Duncan played pro basketball in Australia from 1987 to 1991, and that Shinseki was otherwise occupied as a career military officer.)

Now let’s add the numbers together.

If you take the most restrictive definition -- those employed by businesses other than private law and consulting firms -- Obama can count six members of his 22-member Cabinet with private-sector experience, or 27 percent. (We’re counting Bryson, who hasn’t been confirmed yet.)

If you take what we consider the more common-sense definition -- which includes those who have worked for private law or consulting firms -- then Obama can count 15 out of 22 with private-sector experience, or 68 percent.

That leaves seven of 22 Cabinet members without private-sector experience, or 32 percent.

Our ruling

Bachmann said that ""virtually no one"" in Obama’s Cabinet has private-sector experience. But even under the most restrictive definition, 27 percent of Obama’s Cabinet has what we consider pretty clear private-sector experience. And broader definition that includes private-sector law and consulting work -- much of which involved representing businesses -- kicks the percentage up to two-thirds.

In addition, Bachmann said she would bring in advisers from manufacturing (Chu could fit that bill), the service industry (which could include Salazar) and financial services (which would include Donovan, Daley and Lew).

Conceivably, a Republican president might appoint more business executives to Cabinet posts than a Democratic one would. But Bachmann still overstates her case by saying that ""virtually no one"" in Obama’s Cabinet has private-sector experience -- repeating a false claim that's been circulating for nearly two years. We rate her statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974FC240>],/factchecks/2011/sep/01/michele-bachmann/bachmann-says-obama-has-virtually-no-one-his-cabin/
"['National', 'Energy', 'Foreign Policy', 'New Hampshire 2012', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says Obama delivered $2 billion to Brazil to help offshore drilling
","
On the day he entered the Republican campaign for president, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said at a New Hampshire house party that the Obama administration has made life more difficult for oil companies in Louisiana and Texas while being overly generous to energy projects in other countries.

""This president goes to Brazil and delivers $2 billion to that country to help them with their offshore drilling projects,"" Perry said. ""What are they thinking?""

But as we drilled down into this statement, we found an empty well. Obama didn't ""deliver"" any such thing during his visit to Brazil, and Obama had no connection to a much smaller loan guarantee that a Brazilian company ultimately got from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Experts we interviewed said Perry was distorting the truth and wrongly characterizing what happened.

We tried to contact the Perry campaign, but it did not return calls or e-mails asking for supporting evidence of this statement.

We found Perry is referring to two things: Obama's trip to Brazil in March 2011, which was intended to encourage growing economic and political ties to the country, and a decision by the Ex-Im Bank, an independent agency, to offer a preliminary commitment to a Brazilian oil company in April 2009.

We'll take them one at a time.

Obama's trip to Brazil

On March 19, 2011, Obama met with Brazil’s new President Dilma Rousseff, hailed Brazil as an emerging ""global leader"" and talked of a bright future of cooperation between the two countries.

Several times in his visit, Obama expressed support for increased trade and partnerships with Brazil. He mentioned building infrastructure for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics and developing biofuel technology.

And several times, Obama said that the U.S. wanted to help Brazil develop its recently discovered deepwater oil reserves so the U.S. could be a customer.

At a business summit in Brasilia, Obama said: ""At a time when we’ve been reminded how easily instability in other parts of the world can affect the price of oil, the United States could not be happier with the potential for a new, stable source of energy.""

In an address at the Palacio do Planalto, he said: ""In particular, with the new oil finds off Brazil, President Rousseff has said that Brazil wants to be a major supplier of new stable sources of energy, and I’ve told her that the United States wants to be a major customer, which would be a win-win for both our countries.""

But while Obama said that the U.S. would be a customer for the country's oil, he said nothing about the U.S. providing the $2 billion, as Perry claimed.

Indeed, the action by the Ex-Im Bank involving the Brazilian oil company actually occurred in April 2009, almost two years before Obama's trip. It was approved by bank officials who all were appointees of President George W. Bush.

Bush appointees approved $2 billion deal

Perry's claim that Obama gave Brazil $2 billion echoes criticism we found in many blogs, many of which referred to a Wall Street Journal editorial written in August 2009, titled ""Obama Underwrites Offshore Drilling.""

The editorial correctly reported that the U.S. Export-Import Bank agreed to a ""preliminary commitment"" for $2 billion with the Brazilian oil company Petrobras in 2009. But from there, the waters turned a bit muckier as the editorial held Obama responsible for that development.  

""Americans are right to wonder why Mr. Obama is underwriting in Brazil what he won't allow at home,"" the editorial concluded.

First, a quick explanation of the Ex-Im Bank: It is an independent federal agency that provides financing options -- including direct loans, guarantees of loans and  export-credit insurance -- to foreign buyers to help them buy U.S. goods and services, according to its website.

When we called the Ex-Im Bank’s spokesman Phil Cogan, we could hardly get the question out about Obama's involvement before he interjected.

""Not true,"" Cogan said.

This much is true -- the bank agreed to a preliminary commitment with Petrobras in 2009 for $2 billion. That commitment, in lay terms, was ""an expression of the bank’s willingness to consider an application of loans,"" Cogan said.  

But Obama had no role in approving it. When the bank’s board of directors made that decision on April 14, 2009, all five directors were appointed by Bush. Obama had no appointees on the board at that time.

And it's important to understand that, according to the bank’s charter, the Ex-Im Bank is an independent credit agency. The president appoints the directors to the five-person board -- three of the president’s party, two of the minority party -- but does not vote on or sign off on transactions, Cogan said.

For transactions exceeding $100 million, there is a 30-day review period, during which the president and members of Congress can comment on proposed transactions, Cogan said. But it’s very rare to receive comments, and the ultimate decision is made by the bank’s board of directors.

The Ex-Im Bank receives its spending authority from Congress, but it gets no appropriated funds, Cogan said. It operates using revenue from the fees and interest that it charges lenders and borrowers.

""In those rare cases when it makes direct loans (the majority of our financing is guarantees of loans made by commercial lenders), the bank borrows the money from Treasury, collects fees and charges interest to the ultimate borrower and repays Treasury both principal and interest,"" Cogan explained.

On Feb. 4, 2010, the Ex-Im Bank agreed to a $308 million loan guarantee (out of the initial $2 billion commitment) with Petrobras, essentially guaranteeing prevention of default on a private loan from the lender, which in this case was JPMorgan Chase.

The vote on that $308 million was not unanimous. Chairman Fred Hochberg, the only Obama appointee at that time, and director Diane Farrell voted for it; director Bijan Kian opposed it. They were the only directors that voted.

In an e-mail, Petrobras officials confirmed that the loan has been signed and the money will be used to buy U.S. goods and services. According to the Ex-Im Bank, the companies that will benefit include three companies based in Louisiana  -- and at least five companies in Perry’s home state of Texas.  

No evidence of an Obama connection

So far, there's no evidence to support Perry's case that Obama delivered the loan guarantee. But is it possible the bank was under White House pressure to act?

That's not how the place works, said Joseph Grandmaison, an international trade consultant who lives in Rye, N.H. Grandmaison was appointed by Bush to serve on the Ex-Im Bank’s board of directors for seven years, ending his term in July 2009.

""In all the time I was there, to the best of my knowledge, there were never any calls from the White House to persuade us of anything,"" said Grandmaison, a Democrat. ""They don’t influence transactions.""

That $2 billion preliminary commitment was tantamount to ""establishing a line of credit"" to Petrobras for the purpose of buying American goods. It was also intended to encourage U.S. companies to sell to Petrobras, Grandmaison said, because the financing was in place.  

Oliver O'Connell, an analyst who follows the Ex-Im Bank as editor of Trade Finance Magazine, agrees.

""The idea that the president was somehow involved in this is a fallacy,"" O'Connell said. ""This was about the Ex-Im Bank making sure that U.S. exporters could compete on the same level playing field as their foreign competitors, with the intention of creating American jobs.""

It’s a resilient fallacy, though, one that keeps popping up, from the Wall Street Journal to Fox News, going viral in emails and landing on various conservative blogs. It’s been enough to encourage the Ex-Im Bank to post a fact sheet on its website in attempt to shoot down the various charges.

Addressing the claim that the loan represents a reversal of the Obama administration’s stance on offshore drilling, the fact sheet states: ""There is no connection between federal policies on offshore drilling in U.S. waters and financing U.S. export sales for drilling by other countries. In fact, should Ex-Im Bank refuse to finance sales by U.S. companies it is likely that the sales will go instead to their foreign competitors.""

Cogan could not keep exasperation out of his voice when discussing the matter.

""There have been so many errors and misconceptions about this,"" he said. ""It keeps getting repeated and repeated, despite the facts.""

Our Ruling

Perry’s claim is wrong in several ways. First, the number is wrong. Although there was an initial commitment for $2 billion, it ultimately became a $308 million loan guarantee. Second, Perry ignores that the Ex-Im Bank is an independent federal agency, and he is wrong to attribute its actions to Obama. The initial commitment came when it was controlled by Bush appointees. And although the Obama appointee voted for the $308 million loan guarantee, there is no evidence that it done at the behest of Obama.

"['National', 'Corporations', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Labor', 'Workers', 'Robert Reich']","
Robert Reich says ratio of corporate profits to wages is highest since before Great Depression
","In an Aug. 29, 2011, column, Robert Reich, the former Labor Secretary under President Bill Clinton and a frequent liberal commentator, offered a number of statistics to back up his call for worker protests rather than parades on Labor Day.

""Labor Day is traditionally a time for picnics and parades,"" Reich’s column began. ""But this year is no picnic for American workers, and a protest march would be more appropriate than a parade.""

One of the statistics Reich offered was this: ""The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression.""

A reader asked us to check this out, so we did.

We turned to statistics compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the federal office that calculates official statistics about the economy. We found numbers for corporate profits as well as for two measures of worker income -- wage and salary disbursements, and total employee compensation received. We then divided corporate profits by both of the income measurements, all the way back to 1929. (Here are the full statistics from 1929 to 2011 as we calculated them.)

For wages, we found that Reich was essentially correct. The ratio in 2010 -- the last full year in the statistics -- was .281, which was higher than any year back to at least 1929, the earliest year in the BEA database. The next highest ratio was in 2006, at .265. (We didn’t find pre-1929 data, so the one part of Reich’s statement that we can’t prove is that the ratio was higher ""just before the Great Depression."")

We also looked at total compensation, since the portion of worker compensation delivered outside of wages has grown significantly since 1929. The numbers were slightly different, but the general pattern still held. The ratio in 2010 was .226, which was matched or exceeded in only four years -- 1941, 1942, 1943 and 1950.

To capture the most up-to-date trends, we also looked at the ratios for the last six quarters. For both wages and compensation, the ratio has risen steadily over that year-and-a-half period. For wages, the ratio has climbed from .274 in the first quarter of 2010 to .290 in the second quarter of 2011. For compensation, the ratio has risen from .220 in the first quarter of 2010 to .234 in the second quarter of 2011.

So numerically, there’s little question that Reich is essentially right. (Or, at least for now he is. Economists note that statistics about corporate profits and wages are often revised after the fact.) A more interesting question is what this trendline actually means.

First, we’ll note that the ratio has been remarkably steady over the time we studied. In 2010, corporate income was 168 times what it was in 1929, and wages were 124 times what they were in 1929. But despite the dramatic increases for both measures individually, these two numbers have grown pretty much in tandem. While corporate profits have grown faster, they haven’t grown dramatically faster. Over the eight-decade period, the ratio between corporate profits and wages -- at least prior to 2010 -- almost always hovered between .150 and .235, a pretty narrow range, all things considered.

Within this range, the ratio has regularly zigzagged up and down. The ratio has peaked during World War II, the early 1950s, the mid1960s, the mid1990s and the middle of the first decade of the 21st century.

The 2010 high broke with this history, making the statistic Reich is talking about all the more striking. And as the quarterly data shows, the spike from 2010 has continued into 2011.

This spike has its roots in basic mathematics. The ratio can rise for either of two reasons -- because corporate profits rise, or because wages stagnate. To a greater degree than in past recessions, both of these developments have happened simultaneously in 2010 and 2011. That’s the immediate reason for the ratio’s sudden increase. The ratio was well within historical norms as recently as 2009, the second year of the recession.

Today, ""indicators favorable to workers are either absolutely dreadful, like the percentage of the adult population that is employed, or else improving at a not-very-robust rate, like real compensation per hour, while indicators favorable to business owners, such as record profit levels measured in billions of current dollars, are very delightful indeed,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution.

There are any number of explanations for why businesses are so reluctant to invest their profits today. For instance, Dan Mitchell, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the pattern of low corporate investment that we’re seeing today has to do with ""a climate of economic uncertainty, largely thanks to the threat of more taxes and regulations.""

But the explanation that seems to mesh best with our numbers has to do with economic cycles. While the ratio Reich points to is exaggerated today due to an unusually deep recession and an especially sluggish recovery, the general pattern follows that of other recent recessions, said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation.

Typically, businesses initially lose ground during a recession, while workers suffer somewhat less, in part due to ""sticky wages"" -- the tendency for worker pay to increase or stagnate rather than fall, even in hard times. This pattern tends to decrease the ratio of corporate profits to wages.

However, when the recovery begins, the reverse becomes true -- businesses tend to gain ground faster than workers do, since soft labor markets prevent workers from reaping the rewards of improved productivity. This pushes the ratio of profits to wages higher. Since the current recovery is particularly weak, the increase in the ratio has been even stronger than normal.

The hopeful news for workers, Foster says, is that once a recovery gathers steam and new capital-labor equilibrium is reached, workers tend to accelerate their gains.

""Once a strong recovery is under way and labor markets return to normal, total labor compensation tends to catch up, as employers bid for employees out of the extra profit margin they accumulated during the recovery,"" Foster said. ""So once we start heading toward full employment, we can expect total labor compensation to rise very rapidly relative to total income.""

So where does this leave us? On the numbers, Reich’s claim is essentially correct. And in his analysis, Reich doesn’t over-promise on what the data indicate. Amid evidence that these numbers could turn out to be a temporary spike, he resists the temptation to label it the culmination of a long-term trend. We find Reich’s formulation both factually supportable and appropriately cautious in its interpretation. We give it a rating of True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970EE440>],/factchecks/2011/sep/01/robert-reich/robert-reich-says-ratio-corporate-profits-wages-hi/
"['Poverty', 'Pundits', 'Retirement', 'Social Security', 'Florida', 'Ed Schultz']","
Ed Schultz says Social Security lifts more than a million Floridians out of poverty
","Sen. Marco Rubio, in a recent speech from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, said Social Security and Medicare ""weakened us as a people.""

We used to take care of one another, and our neighbors, until government took over, he explained. 

Liberal MSNBC pundit Ed Schultz called that ""Psychotalk."" 

It's a segment on the Ed Show he uses to scorn comments by politicians and other pundits, most recently Donald Trump, Jon Huntsman, Mitt Romney and George Will. On Aug. 25, he challenged the star Florida conservative, calling him a political hack who wants to get rid of social safety nets. (Rubio, for his part, said in the speech he believes in America's retirement programs, but that they must be changed for those who aren't in them yet to make them sustainable.)

A Florida statistic during the segment caught our attention: ""In Rubio's state of Florida alone, Social Security lifts more than -- count it -- a million people out of poverty."" PolitiFact Florida wanted to know, is that true? (We also checked a statement by Rubio from the same speech about the ratio of workers to retirees in the Social Security program dipping from 16 to 1 down to 3 to 1.)

On its face, the number seems plausible. Social Security benefits, set up as a result of a 1935 law signed by President Franklin Roosevelt, helped support 52 million retired and disabled workers and their relatives in 2009, according to the agency that administers them.

But who provided Schultz's number?

We took a closer look at a Nexis transcript, which we edited slightly after watching the segment ourselves: SCHULTZ: And in Psychotalk tonight, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, he's on the attack against the Big Three. Now Rubio is an early favorite to take the No. 2 spot on the Republican presidential ticket next year thanks to his tea party ideology and his pretty boy looks. But his policies are downright ugly.

During a speech at the Reagan Library this week, Rubio had this to say about programs like Social Security and Medicare.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA: These programs actually weakened us as a people. You see, almost in forever, it was institutions and society that assumed the role of taking care of one another. If someone was sick in your family, you took care of them. If a neighbor met misfortune, you took care of them.

You saved for your retirement and for your future because you had to. … But all of that changed when the government began to assume those responsibilities. ... And as government crowded out the institutions in our society that did these things traditionally, it weakened our people.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

SCHULTZ: I will tell you what's weakening our people: political hacks like Marco Rubio, who want to get rid of social safety nets. Before Medicare -- check this out -- half of American seniors didn't have hospital insurance. Almost a third of Americans lived in poverty.

But after Medicare was signed into law, the poverty rate among senior citizens plummeted from 30 percent to around 10 percent in just 30 years. And it's the same story with Social Security.

According to the Census Bureau data, 20 million more Americans would live below the poverty line if Social Security did not exist. Forty five percent of senior citizens would be poor.

And in Rubio's state of Florida alone, Social Security lifts more than -- count it -- a million people out of poverty. But these right wingers remain determined to dismantle the Big Three, no matter how many Americans suffer.

For Marco Rubio to say programs like Medicare and Social Security weaken Americans is flat out Psychotalk.

For this fact-check, we're setting aside the national statistics Schultz offered about Medicare and Social Security and focusing on his Florida claim.

Where did the Florida statistic come from? Schultz had said in a previous paragraph, ""according to Census Bureau data,"" and a spokeswoman for his show, Tanya Hayre, confirmed ""we source the Census Bureau in our reporting.""

But a graphic on the screen as Schultz spoke gave a different source: the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. We found the report.

It shows Schultz accurately repeated numbers from the think tank's 2010 analysis of Census data.

The authors of the analysis, Paul Van de Water and Arloc Sherman, took the official definition of poverty used by the Census Bureau, then crunched Census-provided numbers on families' poverty status with and without Social Security benefits. Without Social Security, they found, 19.8 million more Americans would have been poor in 2008, including 1.07 million in Florida. (The state numbers relied on a three-year average for 2006-08, to boost the reliability of the results.)

So far, so good, for Schultz.

But whenever someone cites government data but, in fact, is relying on analysis of that data by a think tank, we check to see whether other experts interpret the same data differently. For example, in July Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., cited the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in a claim about the effect of tax cuts on the national debt -- when her conclusion came from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In that case it turned out that conservative think tanks used the same CBO numbers to support a different conclusion. We ultimately rated her statement Half True.

In this case, Van de Water and Sherman named in their report a conservative critic of their analysis, Charles Blahous, one of two public trustees of Social Security and Medicare and a research fellow at the Hoover Institution. We traded e-mails with him. We also called up Andrew Biggs, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research.

A note: These people all know each other. Biggs and Van de Water worked together at the Social Security Administration while Blahous was a special assistant to the president for economic policy focusing on ""retirement security issues."" Now they all work at think tanks, helping shape how we view public policy. And as Van de Water put it, ""We worked together, but we disagree on a number of things.""

Indeed.

Here's what Biggs and Blahous say about Van de Water's analysis: It's meaningless and misleading. 

""The SSA used to publish these figures but stopped because they were deceptive, so now the lefty think tanks calculate the figures themselves,"" Biggs said. ""That says something!""

Van de Water confirmed the Social Security Administration used to do the same analysis while he was there but stopped early into President George W. Bush's administration -- because of views like Blahous'. So the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities started computing the the poverty figures, using the same methodology, he said.

What do Blahous and Biggs find misleading?

The analysis focuses on benefits only, not the years and years of payroll taxes that families fed into the system. What if those tax dollars had stayed in workers' pockets? Would they still face poverty?

""To make any reasonable statements about the program's net effect on poverty, one needs to come up with a model for how high poverty would be without each of Social Security benefits or taxes,"" Blahous said. He says to get a truer sense of the program's current effect, you would have to consult studies like these from the Social Security actuary. In the early years of Social Security, its effect on poverty was much greater -- workers got out in benefits much more than they paid in taxes. It offered a windfall to early beneficiaries at the expense of later ones. But look at Tables 2 or 3 in the actuary's July 2010 publication, he said, and you see that would shift if the program raises taxes or cuts benefits, as it would need to to fully finance benefits more than 25 years from now. For example, low-wage single males born in 1937 or later -- retiring this century -- would actually get out less than they put in. (Very low-wage males, plus females and couples would fare better longer.)

As an aside, that crunch will continue as fewer and fewer workers support more retirees. Meanwhile, the Social Security Administration had to dip into its trust fund several years earlier than anticipated, in part because of the economy. Still, as PolitiFact has ruled twice, it's wrong to say the program's out of money.

That makes it all the more misleading, Blahous and Biggs say, to claim that Social Security lifts more than a million people out of poverty in Florida based on analysis of benefits only. They might not have been in poverty if not for the taxes they paid, and for some it would have been a better deal to invest directly in Treasury bonds rather than in the Social Security system. ""I'm sure it does reduce poverty, but not by anything like they're talking about,"" Biggs said. ""... They're looking at one side of an equation in a very simplistic way.""

Is that the whole story? Not quite.

Let's say low-income workers -- presumably at higher risk for poverty in retirement -- didn't have to pay Social Security taxes. Would they carefully put aside that amount? It's more likely they would spend it, Van de Water said. Not only that, Social Security is designed to pay out more to low-income workers than they put in. In other words, letting them keep their payroll taxes wouldn't support them as well as providing them Social Security checks.

""It's clear that Social Security keeps lots of low-income elderly out of poverty in retirement,"" Van de Water said. 

He acknowledges his analysis answers a very narrow question: How many people would fall into poverty if Social Security checks stopped today? It's not as good for answering the broader question: What if Social Security had never existed at all?

And of course, that's not an easy question to answer, said another expert, Olivia Mitchell of the Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania. 

""If we had no Social Security, people would have to work longer, save more, become more financially literate, buy annuities and private disability insurance, contribute to their own IRAs and pensions, and probably rely more on family and charity if they were hoping to retire,"" she said. ""We can't easily run the counterfactual experiment!""

Yet it's the broader question that Schultz suggests on his MSNBC show in his setup for the Florida statistic. He says, ""20 million more Americans would live below the poverty line if Social Security did not exist."" If it had disappeared into thin air one day in 2008, sure. If it had never come into being? Much tougher to say.

So when he says, ""In Rubio's state of Florida alone, Social Security lifts more than -- count it -- a million people out of poverty,"" he's accurately quoting a study by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities about what would happen if Social Security checks suddenly stopped. But the statistic doesn't directly address Rubio's apparent point, that America would be stronger if FDR had never signed Social Security into existence. That's a matter for thoughtful speculation or a raft of much more complicated studies. We also found it misleading that Schultz mentioned just the Census Bureau as his source, while graphics on the screen in small type confirmed the numbers were in fact crunched by a think tank. For those reasons, we find he used the statistic out of context, and rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967DCA40>],/factchecks/2011/sep/01/ed-schultz/ed-schultz-says-social-security-lifts-million-flor/
"['Ohio', 'Corporations', 'Taxes', 'Dennis Kucinich']","
Rep. Dennis Kucinich says ExxonMobil paid no taxes in 2009 and got $156 million rebate
","
For the past year or so, Exxon Mobil’s tax payments, or lack thereof, have provided political fodder to politicians like Rep. Dennis Kucinich, a Cleveland Democrat  who maintain that U.S.corporations don’t pay their fair share of taxes.

""Let’s go into some facts here and talk about shared responsibility,"" Kucinich told FoxNews host Neil Cavuto in an interview on Aug. 6, 2011 that he conducted from Seattle, with the city’s iconic Space Needle in the background. ""Listen to this: Exxon Mobil, $19 billion in profits in 2009, paid no federal income taxes, received a $156 million rebate.""

The statement had a familiar ring to it, so PolitiFact Ohio checked it out.

Kucinich’s claim is similar to one made last year by Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who asserted that Exxon Mobil booked $19 billion in profit for 2009, paid no taxes and got a $156 million refund from the Internal Revenue Service.

PolitiFact ruled that claim False because Exxon paid many other types of tax that year, and also because it relied on statistics from the company’s 2009 ""10-K"" form that may not reflect the company’s actual tax payments. Officials from Exxon Mobil, as well as a University of North Carolina business school tax professor, said the figure on the form doesn’t  refer to the actual income taxes that Exxon paid to the government, which is confidential. Exxon Mobil spokesmen told PolitiFact the company’s ""U.S. income tax expense"" for 2009 was approximately $500 million. The company declined to provide documentation for that number.

Exxon Mobil’s updated 2010 ""10-K/A"" form also lists ""- $156 million"" as the company’
U.S. income tax figure for 2009, as did the earlier form consulted by Sanders. But Exxon spokesmen Cynthia Bergman White and Ken Cohen reiterated it’s not correct to interpret the negative figure as a $156 million refund. They said it merely reflects a tax credit Exxon obtained because of overpayments in previous years.

In a blog statement that Exxon Mobil released after filing its 2010 forms, Cohen said the company paid more than $9.8 billion in total taxes and duties to the U.S. government and its subdivisions that year, including more than $1.6 billion in income tax expenses. He said the 2009 numbers were taken out of context by the media and politicians.

The numbers ""reflected more than ExxonMobil’s tax expense for 2009 activities,"" said Cohen. ""They included the effect of adjustments to our taxes for earlier years, which exceeded the amounts related to 2009. In fact, ExxonMobil’s income tax expense related to 2009 activities was approximately $500 million.""

That statement matches ExxonMobil’s response to PolitiFact last December.

Kucinich spokesman Nathan White insisted his boss’ claim is ""completely true"" and wasn’t as sweeping as the previous Sanders claim that PolitiFact examined. Kucinich stipulated that Exxon paid no federal income taxes in 2009, while Sanders had said it paid no taxes at all that year.

White pointed to a 2010 report from CNN Money, which also listed Exxon’s 2009 federal tax bill as ""-$156 million"" even as it pointed out that the company paid heavy taxes in other countries, as well as sales taxes in the United States.

""You are comparing apples to oranges,"" White said in an email. ""The Politifact critique of Senator Sanders is irrelevant because the two statements are not the same.""

Kucinich’s words weren’t identical to Sanders’, but were they different  enough to warrant a different rating on the Truth-O-Meter?  

As University of North Carolina tax professor Douglas A. Shackleford told PolitiFact last year, the ""-156 million"" figure that Sanders interpreted as a rebate doesn’t actually refer to the cash taxes that Exxon paid to the U.S. government. The $156 million number refers ""to the U.S portion of the current and deferred income tax expense.""

""It is a (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) number, not a figure from their U.S. corporate tax return,"" Shackleford said. ""The actual income taxes paid by Exxon to the U.S. government is confidential information. It is not reported in their financial statements.""

We contacted Shackleford again, who confirmed that the same rationale would apply to Kucinich’s claim.

The amount of income tax that Exxon Mobil paid to the U.S. government in 2009 is confidential information that did not appear on the forms that Kucinich and Sanders relied upon to make their claims that the company paid no income taxes and got a rebate.

ExxonMobil says the ""- $156 million"" figure reflects holdover tax issues from previous years that showed up in paperwork for 2009, and that it’s U.S. income tax expense for 2009 was approximately $500 million.

A tax professor confirmed that interpreting that $-156 million as the ExxonMoblil’s tax figure would be a misreading of the 10-K form.

Based on that, we rate Kucinich’s statement, as we did Sanders’, as False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097727140>],/factchecks/2011/sep/01/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-exxonmobil-paid-no-taxes-/
"['New Jersey', 'Candidate Biography', 'Bloggers']","
Bloggers claim New Jersey Congressmen Donald Payne and Frank Pallone are socialists
","
U.S. Reps. Donald Payne and Frank Pallone have been serving in Congress for more than two decades as Democrats, but several blog posts have offered another word to describe both officials.

Socialists?

An Aug. 12 post on the website for a group called Sovereign Citizens United names Payne (D-10th Dist.) and Pallone (D-6th Dist.) as members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which it says was created by the Democratic Socialists of America.

""I’m sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open socialists in the US Congress, they would say – well only Bernie Sanders (Senate). But the right answer is much, much worse,"" according to the post.

Another post on a website called ""The Obama File"" mentions Payne and Pallone and claims ""members of the Progressive Caucus also belong to the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).""

Here’s a blog post on Aug. 17 by Texas radio host Dan Cofall, whose show airs out of Fort Worth:
   
""The magic number ‘70’ is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). These are not just politicians who vote left of center; these are card-carrying members of ‘The Democratic Socialists of America’.""

That blog post names Payne, but not Pallone. Cofall did not respond to an email seeking comment.

While most of the names politicians are called are opinions, calling a congressman a Socialist sounds both emphatic and exact.

But real card-carrying Socialists say those members, including Payne and Pallone, aren’t Socialists.
   
The list that Cofall and dozens more rely upon ""is completely fraudulent,"" said Frank Llewellyn, who served as national director of the Democratic Socialists of America for 10 years until stepping down July 5.
   
There is not one member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. In order to join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is not a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said.
   
The last member of Congress who was an actual card-carrying member, he said, was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998.
   
Llewellyn and DSA’s new national director, Maria Svart are chagrined for two reasons. First, they have to spend time knocking down reports that never seem to go away.
   
Second, Llewellyn said, ""if we had formal political relationships with 70-odd members, we would be making a lot more money’’ from dues.

So, Payne and Pallone have been identified as socialists for being members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. But what is that caucus anyway?
   
According to its website, the Progressive Caucus is one of the largest in Congress and works for such causes as economic justice, civil rights and civil liberties as well as global peace and security. Llewellyn said that DSA supports some of the policy positions of the caucus.

But agreeing with some positions doesn’t make a member of Congress a card-carrying Socialist.   

And for the record, both Payne and Pallone reject being labeled a socialist.

With so much space available on the Internet, Payne told PolitiFact New Jersey he wasn’t surprised to learn of the blog posts, but said their reasoning defies logic. Payne argued that progressive principles make the country unique and strong, allowing individuals to move between income levels.

Of the ""socialist"" label, Payne said: ""I’ve been called worse things than that.""

Pallone said in a written statement: ""The progressive label dates back to Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson who fought to break up the corporate monopolies and trusts that were crippling the American economy. Those ideas are just as important in our efforts to create jobs and grow the economy.""
   
The ruling
   
Misinformation and smear campaigns are part of political life. But these persistent claims about socialists are riddled with errors and outright lies. Any one of the problems would be sufficient to discredit the report, but taken together, the effort is flagrantly false. For that reason, we rate this claim: Pants on Fire.

"['Rhode Island', 'Education', 'James Parisi']","
R.I. union leaders says national study shows 20 percent of charter schools perform better than traditional public schools and 40 percent perform worse
","
During a recent discussion on Channel 10’s ""News Conference"" about efforts to expand charter schools in Rhode Island, James Parisi, field representative and lobbyist for the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers and Health Professionals, challenged the notion that charter schools improve student performance.

""I think one of the studies that I pay most attention to,"" Parisi said, ""indicated, on a nationwide basis, looking at two and a half thousand charter schools around the country, maybe 20 percent do better than the community public schools, 40 percent or so do worse and the rest are not having any significant difference.""

Rhode Island has 16 charter schools, including a new one opening Sept. 7, and more are expected to open soon. The state has a three-year, $9.4-million federal grant to expand existing charter schools, open additional ones and build partnerships between charter and traditional public schools.

State Education Commissioner Deborah Gist invited Achievement First, a charter school management operator, to come to Rhode Island. And Gist has testified in favor of a proposal by Cranston Mayor Allan W. Fung -- to be voted on Thursday by the state Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education  -- to open a ""mayoral academy"" charter school. 

Fung hopes to eventually create a network of five such charter schools in Cranston and Providence.

Though taxpayer financed, charter schools generally are run by their own boards and and have more control over how they spend their money on. Rhode Island charter schools are required to participate in standardized testing, but they’re free from some of the administrative staffing rules and contractual restrictions that determine policies such as the length of the school year and school dress codes. Most charter schools admit students by lottery.

Supporters of charter schools often hail them as a solution to the failures, real or perceived, of the nation’s public schools. Skeptics, Parisi among them, say they tend to siphon students and resources from traditional public schools.

And he referenced a study that, he said, cast doubt about the educational value of charter schools. So we decided to check that out.

We contacted Parisi, who faxed us page 142 from ""Death and Life of the Great American School System: How Testing and Choice Are Undermining Education,"" a book by prominent education writer and charter school critic Diane Ravitch.

Ravitch referenced a 2009 study by researchers at Stanford University that analyzed data from 2,403 charter schools in 15 states and the District of Columbia, or roughly 65 to 70 percent of the nation’s charter schools at the time.

Ravitch’s summary of the study results was roughly what Parisi had said, but we didn’t want to take the author’s word for it. So we went online and found the study.

Entitled ""Multiple Choice: Charter School Performance in 16 States,"" (or 15 states and the District of Columbia), the so-called CREDO study was released June 2009 by Stanford University’s Center for Research on Education and Outcomes. (Rhode Island was not among the study’s participants.)

The authors summarized their findings this way: ""The study reveals that a decent fraction of charter schools, 17 percent, provide superior education opportunities for their students. Nearly half of the charter schools nationwide (46 percent) have results that are no different from the local public school options and over a third, 37 percent, deliver learning results that are significantly worse than their student would have realized had they remained in traditional public schools.’’

The percentages correlated roughly with the ones Parisi described. He said 20 percent do better; the study reported it was 17 percent; he said 40 percent do worse, the study reported 37 percent; and he said the rest (46 percent the study said)  showed no significant difference.

We wondered, though, if this particular study is one we could trust. So we called some experts.

""It’s still among the best,’’ Gary Miron, a professor of education at Western Michigan University’s Department of Educational Leadership, said.

Miron reviewed Stanford University’s CREDO study for The Think Tank Review Project, which was created in 2006 by two academic centers associated with the Education Policy Research Unit at Arizona State University and the University of Colorado at Boulder to provide academically sound reviews of think-tank publications. The project is financed by the Great Lakes Center for Education Research Practice.

""The relative strength and comprehensiveness of the data set used for this study, as well as the solid analytic approaches of the researchers,’’ the reviewers wrote, ""makes this report a useful contribution to the charter school research base.""

Though a better study, Miron said, financed by the U.S. Department of Education was released last June. But Stanford University’s CREDO study remains the largest-scale study he’s seen measuring charter school performance.

The Department of Education study, conducted by Mathematica Policy Research, also concluded that charter middle schools that choose their students by lotteries are no more or less successful than traditional middle schools in improving student achievement in reading and math.

But the latest Mathematica study found that the impact of charter schools is not necessarily the same for all children across the board. In fact, that study found that charter schools were more effective for lower income and lower achieving students, and less effective for higher income and higher achieving students.

Charter schools in large urban areas, the Mathematica study showed, had positive impacts on students’ achievement in math -- as opposed to negative impacts for children who lived outside these large urban areas.

The results of Stanford University’s CREDO study, which Parisi used in his argument, also were more nuanced than he’d suggested. In the report’s ""executive summary,"" the authors write that ""charter schools have different impacts on students based on their family backgrounds.""

Students who are black or Hispanic in charter schools performed ""significantly worse"" educationally than their peers in traditional public schools, the study found. But students from poor families who had limited English skills and attended charter schools showed ""better academic growth"" than their traditional public school peers. The outcomes for students in special education programs, the study found, were about the same.

In the end, Parisi quoted a national study of charter schools that is widely recognized as reputable. While he omitted some of the studies more nuanced findings -- so important to any debate about charter schools -- he quoted its main conclusions accurately.

We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097731BC0>],/factchecks/2011/sep/01/james-parisi/ri-union-leaders-says-national-study-shows-20-perc/

Michele Bachmann says U.S. is No. 1 in the world for energy resources
","
During an Aug. 27, 2011, appearance in the central Florida town of Poinciana, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. -- a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination -- made a striking claim about the United States’ energy resources.

According to an Associated Press story, Bachmann said that ""the United States is the No. 1 country in the world for energy resources,"" arguing that, in shale deposits alone, the United States easily outstrips the total oil supply of Saudi Arabia. ""That doesn't even include … all the oil in Alaska.""

Bachmann added, ""Instead of thinking we are beggars out here begging for oil and for energy, we are the king daddy dogs when it comes to energy. The radical environmentalists have demanded that we lock up all our energy resources. President Bachmann will take that key out of the door. I will unlock it.""

Several readers asked us to look at whether the U.S. is in fact ""the No. 1 country in the world for energy resources.""

First, some background on how energy resources are measured. We found a concise explanation in a report issued on Nov. 30, 2010, by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress. (According to a different Associated Press article, Bachmann actually cited the CRS report during her Poinciana event.)

""It is important to keep in mind that naturally occurring deposits of any material, whether it is fossil fuels, gold, or timber, comprise a broad spectrum of concentration, quality, and accessibility (geologic, technical, and cultural),"" CRS wrote. The report’s authors suggested visualizing this notion as a pyramid -- a small amount of easily recoverable resources at the top, with increasingly large deposits that are more and more difficult to extract toward the base of the pyramid.

Energy experts use a variety of technical terms that describe how easily and how economically feasible it is to extract a given resource. Here are a few of the more common terms, in descending order of cost-effectiveness:

• Proved reserves. This refers to estimates made with ""reasonable certainty"" to be ""commercially recoverable"" under current economic and governmental conditions.

• Undiscovered, economically recoverable resources. These are resources that are expected to be found eventually based on geological features of a given location and which are likely to be economically feasible once recovery proceeds.

• Undiscovered, technically recoverable resources. These are resources that are expected to be found eventually based on geological features of a given location and which are likely to be recoverable but which will not necessarily be recoverable on an economically feasible basis.

We looked at detailed international comparisons compiled by the Energy Information Administration, the statistical office of the U.S. Department of Energy. We’ll look at the data for three fossil fuels -- petroleum, natural gas and coal. We won’t look at renewable energy (such as biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar or wind) because it’s difficult to make international comparisons for renewable energy that countries could potentially harness.

Petroleum: U.S. petroleum reserves are relatively small -- less than 21 billion barrels. By comparison, the top four are Saudi Arabia (263 billion barrels), Venezuela (211 billion), Canada (175 billion), and Iran (137 billion).

Natural gas: The U.S. does better on this score. It has 273 trillion cubic feet of proved reserves, ranking fourth in the world behind Iran (1,046 trillion cubic feet), Qatar (896 trillion cubic feet) and Saudi Arabia (276 trillion cubic feet). All told, the U.S. accounts for 4 percent of the world total.

Coal: This is where the U.S. can lay its most plausible claim to be ""king daddy dog."" The EIA’s international comparison -- which uses the more relaxed standard of recoverable coal rather than proved reserves -- the U.S. has 260 billion short tons of coal. Its closest competitors are Russia (173 billion short tons) and China (126 billion short tons). The U.S. possesses a whopping 27 percent of the world total.

Using a different data set, we also looked at the world reserves of uranium, the material used for nuclear reactors. According to the World Nuclear Association, the U.S. has 342,000 tons of ""known, recoverable"" uranium. That’s 6 percent of the world total, ranking sixth in the world behind Australia (23 percent of the world total), Kazakhstan (15 percent), Russia (10 percent), South Africa (8 percent) and Canada (8 percent).

In its report, CRS made a couple attempts to make the kind of comprehensive, international comparison Bachmann made. Doing so requires some mathematical adjustments so that the figures for oil, natural gas and coal can be added together. This is done by adjusting the numbers for the amount of energy each resource produces. The unit of measurement CRS used is ""barrels of oil equivalent.""

CRS concluded that the U.S. had about 973 billion barrels of oil equivalent in its reserves, which ranks first in the world. Russia was a close second at 955 billion and China a distant third with 475 billion.

The U.S. also ranked first using a different measurement -- one that takes the reserves total from the previous calculation and adds to it technically recoverable (but not necessarily economically feasible) undiscovered oil and natural gas. CRS did not include technically recoverable, undiscovered coal in this calculation, even though it could be a substantial resource, because it found the data too speculative.

By this measurement, the U.S. also ranked first in the world with 1.3 trillion barrels of oil equivalent, once again narrowly leading Russia, which had 1.2 trillion. Saudi Arabia, China and Iran ranked third, fourth and fifth, trailing the U.S. and Russia by large margins.

These two comparisons demonstrate that Bachmann has justification for saying that ""the United States is the No. 1 country in the world for energy resources.""

""Directionally, I think she is right,"" said Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy Forum at Rice University’s James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy. ""We have giant energy resources here.""

At the same time, the CRS report offers caveats that undercut such a broad-brush conclusion. Here are some of them:

• Uncertain measurements. Not only is the science of estimating reserves and potentially recoverable resources subject to conjecture, but there’s no guarantee that every country’s data is reliable, since not every nation has put the same effort into researching the question -- or, if they have, they may not be interested in sharing accurate information with economic rivals. In addition, the data is old, CRS says. ""There has been no reliable source for estimates of undiscovered oil and natural gas resources internationally since the U.S. Geological Survey completed its World Petroleum Assessment in 2000,"" CRS wrote.

• The role of coal. The United States’ top ranking owes much to its lead in coal. But coal’s uses are limited since, barring some undiscovered technological advance, it cannot be used to power automobiles and other vehicles. ""Not now nor in the near future will coal be a fuel source for transportation, as oil is,"" said Robin Dutta, research associate at the University of Delaware’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy. Because of this, Dutta called it ""a false comparison"" to compare, say, Saudi Arabia’s reserves to those in the United States.

In addition, coal’s future viability as a fuel is somewhat in question because it is believed to be a major contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Many scientists believe that the impact of carbon dioxide emissions poses a serious ecological threat by promoting climate change, particularly on a long-term time scale.

• How economical will extraction be? There are large and potentially recoverable troves of fossil fuels in the United States, but there’s a question about whether, and how soon, they’ll be economically viable. Citing oil shale and methane hydrate resources as examples, CRS said that ""the uncertainty associated with estimates of those deposits is too great to produce meaningful comparisons. … The final tally would have very little meaning considering the difficulties in estimating those resources.""

Also unknown is how much of an environmental cost there would be to extraction, or how much government investment would be necessary if the industry considered it uneconomical on its own terms.

• Non-fossil fuels. We noted that the CRS study didn’t measure nuclear energy or conventional forms of renewable energy such as solar, wind or biomass. Nor did it include more experimental technologies, such as energy from ocean waves, or even nuclear fusion. In the long term, one or more of these technologies may become more important than the fossil fuels we’re assessing here -- but we don’t know which one, or what nation will be best positioned to take advantage of the new methods.

With its many windy and sunny locations, the U.S. could conceivably continue as the ""king daddy dog"" into a new era of renewable energy. But saying that today would be more speculative than certain.

Our ruling

Bachmann can point to some very specific numbers from a credible source -- CRS -- that place the United States first in the world in fossil-fuel reserves. But while she cited this big number from the CRS report at Poinciana, she also glossed over a number of caveats that raise questions about the significance of the No. 1 ranking.

The U.S. lead is predominantly due to its large stores of coal, yet coal’s environmental effects pose a question mark for the future use of these resources. Meanwhile, for both coal and other fossil fuels, there’s continuing uncertainty about whether the U.S. will be able to exploit these resources in a way that’s economically feasible. Finally, there’s no way of knowing which renewable or experimental energy sources will become important in the future, and as a result, whether the U.S. will be well placed to dominate the field.

We find Bachmann’s statement supportable based on available statistics, but the statistics may not be completely reliable. Some of the estimates include resources that would not be tapped if companies found it more profitable to exploit resources outside the U.S. We consider Bachmann's statement to be accurate, but find that it leaves out important details.

Club for Growth says potential Republican U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson supported “Obamacare”
","
Ever since former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson surfaced as a potential candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2012, the conservative Club for Growth has waged a campaign to stop him from becoming the Republican nominee.

The anti-tax group argues that rather than Thompson, who served as the health and human services secretary under GOP President George W. Bush, Wisconsin Republicans should support ""a pro-growth conservative.""

In casting Thompson as not conservative enough, Club for Growth has focused on the signature legislation of Democrat Barack Obama’s presidency: the federal health care reform law, which Republicans have labeled ""Obamacare.""

Club for Growth launched its campaign on May 18, 2011, the day after Thompson was mentioned in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel as a possible candidate for the seat being vacated by 23-year Democratic Sen. Herb Kohl. The group issued a statement saying Thompson ""supported Obamacare,"" following it the next day with an Internet ad claiming he ""was a champion of Obamacare.""

The attacks continued, with Club for Growth saying in late May 2011 that Thompson helped implement the law; in June 2011, that he is (rather than was) a champion of the law; and in mid-August 2011, that he supported ""Obamacare.""

Then in a TV ad released Aug. 23, 2011, Club for Growth, as it did in its Internet ad, used a video clip in which Obama says Thompson supports health care reform.

That’s quite a few statements. But the main claim is that Thompson, who is expected to launch a formal campaign committee after Labor Day, supported ""Obamacare.""

That is the claim we’ll test.

The health care reform plan is formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Signed into law by Obama in March 2010, it aims to expand health care coverage, control costs and improve delivery of services.  

We asked Barney Keller, a spokesman for Club for Growth -- which has a Wisconsin affiliate that has not joined in the criticism of Thompson -- for evidence to back the national group’s claim. He cited six developments:

Oct. 4, 2009: The White House issued a statement from Thompson and Dick Gephardt, the former Democratic House majority leader from Missouri, saying the health care reform bill to be considered by the Senate Finance Committee has ""some issues that remain troublesome and unresolved,"" but that it was ""another important step toward achieving the goal of health care reform this year."" The statement also said: ""Failure to reach an agreement on health reform this year is not an acceptable option.""

Oct. 9, 2009: In his weekly address to the nation, Obama said the Senate Finance Committee version of health care reform would soon be merged with reform bills produced by other congressional committees. Obama also said Thompson was among Republicans who had ""come out in support of reform."" It was a video clip from that address that Club for Growth used in its ads.

Oct. 13, 2009: Thompson wrote an article for the liberal Huffington Post website, saying health reform legislation before Congress ""offers a big opportunity to lower our nation's health costs by expanding the use of ""community health teams."" He urged the bill being considered by the Senate be amended to ""provide increased support for CHTs.""

So, looking only at Club for Growth’s first three points, Thompson expressed reservations about the health care reform legislation as it stood at the time, but also spoke favorably of it.

Club for Growth’s other three points cited developments after the bill became law.

June 30, 2010: Thompson was pictured with Obama’s health and human services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, and other former federal officials in a photo on the White House website. Sebelius wrote in a blog post that Thompson and others who attended a meeting with her that day ""offered some great ideas about implementation and outreach, suggestions about strategies to make sure that the Affordable Care Act is successful.""

So, Thompson participated in a meeting on implementing the law, but that isn’t evidence that he supported the law or all its provisions.

Nov. 2, 2010: Asked why he didn’t think Republicans would try to repeal the law, Thompson said on CNBC: ""I think because when you -- when it's all said and done, you're not going to be able to repeal health care because President Obama is not going to sign it and they don't have enough votes to override a veto. So why push a cart up hill when you know it's not going to be able to get to the top?""

Thompson’s statement argues that repealing the law wasn’t possible, it doesn’t by itself express support for the law.

June 27, 2011: In another Huffington Post article, Thompson urged governors to set up health insurance exchanges as a ""market-based solution"" that would allow insurance companies to compete in their states. If the governors didn’t act, he warned, the federal government would set up the exchanges.

Again, Thompson’s statement itself doesn’t express direct support for the law, but rather warns what would happen under the law if governors didn’t set up the exchanges.

So, that is Club for Growth’s case that Thompson supported health care reform.  

We asked Darrin Schmitz, a consultant to Thompson, for a response to the claim. He made six points in arguing that Thompson never supported what became law.

""Thompson does support health care reform,"" Schmitz said. ""He has never made a secret of that. But there is no evidence he supported Obamacare -- because he didn't.""

The points cited by Thompson:

June 17, 2008: Thompson said at a forum on health care reform, nearly four months before Obama was elected: ""I don’t want a mandate"" forcing people to buy health insurance.

That’s accurate, but Thompson also said moments later: ""I’m not opposed to it, I just don’t think it’s the most practical way.""

So, it’s clear Thompson had reservations about a central component of health care reform, which requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance. But that doesn’t establish that Thompson opposed the entire plan.

Sept. 23, 2009: Thompson told a Fox News affiliate in Washington, D.C.: ""The problem is (Obama) is reaching for other items that divide us. And I’m trying to pull us back together as Americans to what really unites us."" Thompson had been asked whether Obama was communicating effectively on health care reform.

The quote is accurate, although Thompson preceded that comment by saying there should be hope that a health care reform bill can be adopted because ""everybody can rally around"" changes he advocated that ""take up about 90 percent of health care.""

So, Thompson expressed support for a reform bill being passed, but he had differences with Obama.

Oct. 14, 2009: After Democrats produced a TV ad that referenced Thompson and  criticized other Republicans for not supporting health care reform, Thompson told Fox News he protested to the White House and the ad was taken down. He said had not given permission to be used in an ad that criticized Republicans. Asked whether he supported the reform bill, Thompson said: ""Not this one.""

Thompson also said in the interview: ""What I’m trying to do is bring the parties together, saying there’s 80 percent of this health care bill that both political parties can support, which would be good for America ....Let’s team up together, let’s get something done.""

So, Thompson voiced opposition to the legislation, although he said it contained many good elements and that he wanted some type of reform legislation approved.

Dec. 20, 2009: Thompson said in another statement issued with Gephardt: ""The bill before the Senate this week isn't and shouldn't be the final answer, but the status quo is simply unacceptable."" The statement also said: ""Let's work together on a bipartisan basis to make this a reality.""

That is Thompson again stating reservations about the legislation, but expressing opposition to the status quo, not to the legislation.

March 20, 2010: On the day the House approved the reform bill, which had already been approved by the Senate, Thompson said the legislation ""has the potential to change the current social services fabric because the health insurance transformation that will pass will be the beginning of a government-controlled health care system.""

Thompson had been asked whether the bill would ""fundamentally alter the social safety net."" His brief response certainly was critical of the final legislation.

We found that in 2007, during his brief run for president, Thompson expressed opposition to a government-run health care system and support for market-based alternatives. He reiterated that position in testimony to the Senate Finance Committee in May 2008, prior to Obama’s election.   

June 15, 2011: Thompson said the law ""has got to be repealed and replaced and re-written.""

Thompson’s opposition to the law, made to Republican donors after criticism of his stance on the reform law had escalated, is not evidence that he didn’t support the measure earlier.

So, where has this review put us?

Preferring that a more conservative Republican run for an open U.S. Senate seat in Wisconsin in 2012, Club for Growth has repeatedly claimed that Thompson supported ""Obamacare."" It’s a potentially pivotal question, particularly among conservative voters in a primary election, should Thompson enter the race.

The evidence shows he expressed both support and opposition to the health care reform legislation that eventually became law.

On the one hand: Thompson described the measure, as it worked through Congress, as ""another important step"" toward achieving health care reform and as a ""big opportunity"" to lower health care costs.

On the other hand: The day after calling the bill a ""big opportunity,"" Thompson said he opposed the measure. Two months later, he said the bill wasn’t ""the final answer,"" but that keeping the status quo was ""simply unacceptable.""  

Thompson never came out clearly for or against what became law, despite the fact that he now says he supports repealing it. He made it possible for Club for Growth to claim he supported Obamacare and for himself to deny he supported it. There is evidence to support both positions.

We rate Club for Growth’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097728500>],/factchecks/2011/aug/31/club-growth/club-for-growth-says-potential-Republican-US-Senat/
"['Environment', 'Ohio', 'Climate Change', 'Kevin Coughlin']","
GOP candidate Kevin Coughlin says there's not much evidence to support human role in global warming
","Kevin Coughlin, a former Republican state legislator from Cuyahoga Falls, has been making Ohio’s political rounds this summer in an effort to capture his party’s nod to take on Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown next year.

At an Aug. 18 stop in Strongsville, Coughlin told the Strong Ohio tea party group he believes the science behind global warming is ""sketchy.""

""Scientists who consider themselves to be environmentalists disagree on the science and the impact,"" Coughlin said. ""There is no question that the earth’s core is increasing slightly in temperature.

""But the real question and I think what’s pertinent to the debate in our country and in global politics is how much people really contributed to it and I don’t really think there’s much evidence to suggest that people have or can do very much to change anything.""

That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention.  

We contacted Coughlin, whose appearance was captured on video by a Democratic super PAC, American Bridge 21st Century. He acknowledged making the remarks, although he said meant to say the Earth’s atmosphere -- not its core -- is rising in temperature.

But do scientists agree with his assertion that there’s not ""much evidence to suggest that people have or can do very much to change anything.""

Many Republican politicians apart from Coughlin assert that scientists disagree whether human actions contribute to global warming.

Before he dropped out of the GOP presidential primary last month, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty told the Miami Herald newspaper ""the science is in dispute"" over ""how much, if any"" climate change can be blamed on human behavior. At an Aug. 17 New Hampshire campaign stop, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said that scientists are regularly ""coming forward and questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change.""

PolitiFact examined these claims by Pawlenty and Perry, and found them to be False. That’s because there does appear to be a scientific consensus that people contribute to global warming.

To begin with, a 2007 report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s leading international scientific body on climate science, states: ""Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone."" (External forcing refers to anything that changes the climate that is outside of the normal climate system.)

A 2009 report from the U.S. Global Change Research Program reached a similar conclusion: ""Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.""

Current climate change research was reviewed again this year by the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences. The committee it assembled concluded that global warming poses significant risks and is happening primarily because of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. It rejected the idea that those findings are in any way questionable.

""Although the scientific process is always open to new ideas and results, the fundamental causes and consequences of climate change have been established by many years of scientific research, are supported by many different lines of evidence, and have stood firm in the face of careful examination, repeated testing, and the rigorous evaluation of alternative theories and explanations,"" the committee’s report said.

A few scientists dispute the IPCC’s conclusions on global warming, but most acknowledge that humans contribute to increased temperatures. They make more nuanced points, like  questioning whether carbon emissions by themselves are enough to boost temperatures, whether other human activities contribute, whether rising temperatures cause severe weather, and whether public policy change is needed to address potential problems.

Climate change skeptics cite an online petition with more than 31,000 signatures to demonstrate their viewpoint is widespread. The petition states ""there’s no convincing scientific evidence"" that human greenhouse gas releases are disrupting the Earth’s climate, and there’s ""substantial evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects"" on Earth’s plants and animals. That petition has been criticized for not checking the credentials of its signatories or even proving they exist.

But surveys of large numbers of climate researchers show a clear consensus among them that humans are causing climate change.

One 2010 study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that 97 to 98 percent out of 1,372 climate researchers who are publishing scientific studies in the field say they believe that human beings are causing climate change, and that the scientific credentials of researchers who doubt that role are ""substantially below that of the convinced researchers.""

A study published the previous year by the American Geophysical Union, asked more than 3,100 scientists whether they think human activity significantly contributes to ""changing mean global temperatures."" About 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered ""Yes,"" with a 97.4 percent affirmative rate among climate change specialists.

While a few skeptics out there disagree, there’s clear scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and that humans contribute to it. Disagreement on the subject is scant enough that we rule Coughlin’s statement is False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C449E40>],/factchecks/2011/aug/31/kevin-coughlin/gop-senate-candidate-kevin-coughlin-says-theres-no/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Texas', 'John Cornyn']","
John Cornyn says the Congressional Budget Office predicts unemployment will be 8 percent until 2014
","
In an Aug. 24, 2011, Twitter post, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn said of the Congressional Budget Office: ""CBO says 8 (percent) unemployment till 2014!""

We’ll assume the Texas Republican doesn’t consider this fabulous news, though the predicted rate would be about a percentage point lower than the July 2011 national jobless rate of 9.1 percent, as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

A reminder: The unemployment rate is a measure of the number of jobless people who are available for work and are actively seeking jobs, expressed as a percentage of the labor force.

Did Cornyn recap accurately?

The nonpartisan CBO’s summary of its latest economic projections says that with ""modest economic growth expected for the next few years,"" the office expects the jobless rate to fall to 8.9 percent the fourth quarter of this year and to 8.5 percent the fourth quarter of 2012. And indeed, the report says, the rate will ""remain above 8 percent until 2014.""

The nation’s gross domestic product grew 1 percent the second quarter of this year after growing .4 percent in the year’s first three months, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported in August. According to the CBO forecast, the economy will grow slowly in coming years as the federal deficit shrinks, though the prediction about the deficit assumes, among other things, that Congress will not extend all the tax cuts launched under President George W. Bush and temporarily extended under President Barack Obama.

In its full report, the CBO projects the annual unemployment rate to average 8.7 percent in 2012 and 2013, which would be an improvement on the 2010 and 2009 averages of 9.6 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively, but would be worse than the 2008 average of 5.8 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

CBO forecasts the unemployment rate falling to an average of 5.4 percent in 2016 and 5.2 percent in 2017 through 2021, which would be the lowest rate since 2007, when the average was 4.6 percent. The report says the projected 5.2 percent rate in those years would match its expected ""natural"" unemployment rate for the period.

Economists talk about a natural unemployment rate because even in a strong, healthy economy there is always some degree of employee turnover as businesses adopt new technologies and make other staff changes, and as a certain percentage of workers, for various professional and personal reasons, look for new jobs.

Things are unsettled now, the CBO report says, with weakness in the demand for goods and services being the ""principal restraint on hiring, but structural impediments in the labor market — such as a mismatch between the requirements of existing job openings and the characteristics of job seekers (including their skills and geographic location) — appear to be hindering hiring as well.""

""Other measures also show a great deal of weakness in the labor market,"" the report says. ""The number of unemployed workers per job opening averaged about 4½ throughout the first half of 2011, down from an average of slightly over 6 in 2009 but still much higher than it was before the recession. In addition, the number of people who are employed part time but want full-time work averaged about 8.5 million in the first half of 2011, slightly below the number in the previous two years but still nearly double the pre-recession figure.""

The report continues: ""Likewise, the share of unemployed people who have been out of work for a long time is unusually high. On average, 44 percent of workers who were unemployed in the first half of 2011 had been jobless for more than six months. Moreover, in mid-2011, 31 percent of unemployed workers had been jobless for at least a year. Those rates of long-term unemployment are unprecedented in the post-World War II era.""

We’re not judging here who’s responsible for the nation’s unemployment troubles, but how accurately Cornyn echoed the CBO’s projection. His statement rates True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973F0440>],/factchecks/2011/aug/31/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-congressional-budget-office-says-/
"['Oregon', 'Voting Record', 'Oregon League of Conservation Voters']","
Was Rep. Mike Schaufler the only Democrat to vote against health care reform?
","
Rep. Mike Schaufler is facing a tough primary challenge in his re-election bid for House District 48. Much of the criticism being lobbed his way paints him as a Democrat in name only, one who has a tendency to side with Republicans on high-profile issues.

One particularly damning mailer comes from the Oregon League of Conservation Voters. Schaufler’s face is shown alongside former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin’s. ""Mike Schaufler Stands with Tea Party Republicans,"" the mailer reads.

What was the mailer’s basis for tying Schaufler to Republicans? A vote he took on health care legislation during the February 2012 session.

""When a bill to implement Governor Kitzhaber and President Obama’s health care reform plan came up for a vote in Oregon, Schaufler was the only Democrat who voted to stop it.""

February wasn’t that long ago -- and this particular vote stood out pretty clearly in our minds. We thought we ought to take a look at just how accurate the accusation is.

The mailer cites its source -- ""Check the Facts"" -- as an article from The Oregonian headlined ""A Democrat defects in the Oregon House, stalls insurance bill."" The story is easily found online. Here’s how reporter Harry Esteve describes the day’s events:

""An Oregon House Democrat broke ranks Monday and helped Republicans stall a key health insurance bill, throwing into question the delicate balance of power at the Legislature.

""Rep. Mike Schaufler, of Happy Valley, provided the sole Democratic vote that sent a bill setting up health insurance exchanges back to committee and to an uncertain future.""

Explaining his vote to stall the bill, Schaufler said, ""We need to create jobs. We shouldn't do anything this session until we do that."" He also pointed out, the story said, that ""he has been making almost daily speeches on the House floor about the need to free up timber and water for job creation, and said no one should be surprised by his action Monday.""

Now, this all went down on Feb. 13. Let’s fast-forward a few weeks to March 2, when the bill managed to get back to the floor for a final vote. That day, Schaufler (and, it should be noted, 25 Republicans) voted with every single Democratic House member to pass the legislation. The Senate followed suit three days later and the legislation became law.

We called the Oregon League of Conservation Voters to see what they had to say about this second vote. Doug Moore, the executive director, said the second vote had nothing to do with the mailer.

""We’re talking about a specific vote,"" he said. ""We cite that specific vote.""

But what of the overall impression that he voted to kill the bill?

""We didn’t say he voted against it. We didn’t say he voted to kill it. We said he voted to stop it,"" Moore argued. ""Campaign communications are about talking to voters and there’s not an obligation to tell both sides of the story when sending out mail pieces.""

Yes, but that both-sides-of-the-story issue can be relevant in determining what’s true and determining truth is why we at PolitiFact Oregon have jobs. We agree that Schaufler certainly voted to stall the bill initially -- and he ticked off a lot of his fellow Democrats in doing so. But he didn’t vote to kill it, which the ad implies -- even if it uses the word ""stop."" Whether Schaufler’s actions were justified, we can’t say, but it seems pretty obvious to us that he stalled the bill to get action on other bills and not for reasons pertaining to the legislation itself.

What’s more, Schaufler ultimately gave his blessing to the bill. In truth, it didn’t face much partisan opposition at all. It passed just five votes shy of a unanimous endorsement.

The Oregon League of Conservation Voters is trying to make Schaufler seem out of touch with his Democratic base. That’s not our call. We’re concerned with whether he was really ""the only Democrat who voted to stop"" the health care legislation.

Yes, he voted to stall the legislation. The statement has an element of truth. But it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, namely that in the end he voted to pass it. That’s why we rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2CFBC0>],/factchecks/2012/may/10/oregon-league-conservation-voters/was-rep-mike-schaufler-really-only-dem-vote-agains/
"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Virginia', 'Jamie Radtke']","
Jamie Radtke says 2 percent annual cuts would balance budget in 2016
","
GOP Senate candidate Jamie Radtke says she has a plan to end the federal government’s deficit spending in five years: cut spending by 2 percent each year.

Radtke, a tea party organizer, outlined the idea on her campaign website, where she compared cutting the federal spending to reducing her children’s $1 allowances during a time of family need.

""My kids would have no problem cutting two cents out of their allowance so we could ensure that we can provide for their basic needs,"" Radtke wrote in an April 5 post. ""So what if I told you that if Congress were willing to do the same thing with the federal budget, we could balance the budget in five years and save America from financial Armageddon?""

Radtke calls her proposal ""My Two Cents"" and touted it during an April 28 debate among the four candidates running in the June 12 Republican primary for the Senate. ""I’m the only candidate up here that has offered concrete solutions on how to balance the budget in five years,"" she said.

We wondered if the United States, running a $1.2 trillion deficit this fiscal year, really could balance its budget by cutting spending 2 percent annually through 2016.

Radtke used predictions in an August 2011 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. She started with CBO’s baseline projections, which assumes that current spending laws will play out as enacted. Then she added a few assumptions of her own, according to Chuck Hansen, a spokesman for here campaign.

Radtke, unlike the CBO baseline, posited that the Bush tax cuts will be extended at the end of this year and that the Alternative Minimum Tax will be indexed for inflation, as Congress has done in the past. Those two assumptions result in about $1.4 trillion more in debt over four years, the CBO estimates say.

We took Radtke’s 2 percent idea and assumptions, and we applied them to the CBO’s latest baseline projections, published in March.

This fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the federal government is expected to spend $3.64 trillion and collect revenues of $2.46 trillion. Under Radtke’s proposal, the government would freeze spending at the $3.64 trillion mark and then cut 2 percent each year. The red ink would disappear during fiscal 2016, when spending would be pared to $3.36 trillion and revenues would come in at $3.47 trillion. That means there would be a $110 billion surplus.

So Radtke is mathematically correct in saying annual 2 spending cuts would balance the budget in 2016. We should point out it would take four years to end deficits, not the five years the candidate claims.

But is her proposal realistic?

In practice, the policy would require far more sacrifice than Radtke suggests. Her presentations ignore a key point: The cost of federal entitlement programs -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- will increase over the next four years and longer as Baby Boomers retire and collect benefits.

So during the same four years that the Radtke proposal would push down spending with compounded 2 percent annual cuts, the CBO projects the cost of the federal government’s current policies will rise by about 3 percent a year -- almost entirely to support mandatory adjustments to entitlement programs.

In 2016, Radtke’s plan would cut $282 billion from the current spending level, requiring Congress to bring the budget down to $3.36 trillion. But the CBO estimates the costs of current policies will increase by about $460 billion in 2016, bringing the baseline budget up to $4.1 trillion.

So in 2016, there would be about a $742 billion gap between Radtke’s proposal and the CBO baseline budget. That means for Radtke’s plan to work, Congress in 2016 would have to cut about $742 billion from existing programs. The excision would almost match the entire $786 billion defense budget this year and exceed the $708 billion expected to be spent on Medicare.

Radtke’s proposal would slice almost twice as deep as the House Republican budget plan, which in 2016 calls for a $410 billion cut to current services, including a major overhaul of Medicare. The GOP budget calls for the U.S. to keep running deficits until 2040.

Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that advocates a mix of cutting spending and increasing revenues to balance the budget, was dismissive of Radtke’s proposal.  

""Surely it seems reasonable in the face -- cut 2 percent and you’ll get there,"" he said. ""But what do you cut? The real question is your intestinal fortitude to do that. There are mandatory spending programs -- Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid -- and then, even in discretionary spending, the big enchilada there is defense, and you don’t go too far in Virginia talking about defense cuts.""

Roberton Williams, senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center, pointed out that Radtke’s plan in 2016 would limit spending to about 80 percent of the amount the CBO says would be needed to support current programs.

""The issue is not whether her numbers are accurate but whether they would mean much larger spending cuts than the rhetoric suggests,"" he said via email.

Radtke does not prescribe a formula for achieving the 2 percent cuts, according to Hansen, her campaign spokesman.

""That said, she has said that Social Security and other entitlements are not sustainable for seniors or younger people in their current form,"" he said. ""She has proposals reforming Social Security, Medicare and other entitlements so we can provide better services with less money.""

Radtke, on her website, calls for a number of spending cuts: repealing President Barack Obama’s health care act; eliminating Medicare fraud; allowing health savings accounts in Medicare; moving Medicaid to a block grant program; permitting younger people to invest Social Security contributions; cutting foreign aid and eliminating federal subsidies for products such as ethanol.

Radtke told us she does not know how much her specific policy proposals would save and offered no assurance they would cover the cost of her deficit-reduction proposal. She said her point is not to offer an exact list of cuts for her 2 percent idea, but simply to show the math works.

""I wanted to show people that it doesn’t have to be a shock to the system,"" she said. ""This is a very reasonable approach -- it can give us the process and infrastructure because we can’t continue with business as usual."" 
Our ruling 
Radtke says the U.S. budget could be balanced by 2016 if Congress froze the current spending level and then cut it by 2 percent in each of the next four years. As a cold equation, the math works out. 
But Radtke sugarcoats her tough proposal by comparing it to cutting a child’s allowance by pennies. Her program of 2 percent cuts does not account for the mandated increases in entitlement programs. While she says she would be cutting about $282 billion over four years, Congress would really need to cut $742 billion from programs as they now exist. 
Her program would actually require cuts in current programs going far deeper than anything proposed by even House Republican budget writers in their war against spending. That makes Radtke’s plan highly unrealistic. 
Radtke’s calculation doesn't give a full result. For that reason, we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097811440>],/factchecks/2012/may/10/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-says-2-percent-annual-cuts-would-bala/

Barack Obama says government job losses on his watch are unprecedented
","
In a May 8, 2012, speech on the economy in Albany, N.Y., President Barack Obama sought to put the nation’s economic challenges on his watch in historical context. He especially sought to explain how hard it’s been to increase the national employment level when governments have been hemorrhaging jobs. These job losses, he suggested, have weighed down the comparatively healthy private-sector job-creation statistics. 
""It's worth noting, by the way -- this is just a little aside -- after there was a recession under Ronald Reagan, government employment went way up,"" Obama said. ""It went up after the recessions under the first George Bush and the second George Bush. So each time there was a recession with a Republican president … we compensated by making sure that government didn't see a drastic reduction in employment. The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me."" 
That paragraph includes a lot of claims, but for this item, we’ll pare it down to one sentence: ""The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me."" 
To check this, we turned to employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We’ve defined ""government employment"" in the most expansive way -- a combination of federal, state and local government employment -- since Obama didn’t specify a particular level of government. (His press office did not return our inquiry for this story.) 
As we’ll see, the most difficult part of analyzing this claim is figuring out what time frame to use; using different periods can lead to different conclusions. So we’ll look at a few scenarios. 
Has government employment ever gone down previously ""during a recession""? 
If you look at the double-dip recession that lasted from January 1980 to November 1982, government employment did go down during the recession. (Officially, these were two recessions during that stretch. However, they were so closely spaced, and with such a short ""recovery"" in between, that the statistics are a lot less messy if you consider them to be one long recession.) 
During the official period of this double-dip recession, government employment fell by 224,000 workers, or about 1.3 percent. The decline was even steeper if you start counting from the peak of government employment, which came four months into the recession, and if you stop at the low point for government employment, which came five months before the end of the recession. The decline over this period was 693,000 jobs, or 4.1 percent. 
Either of these two declines was steeper than what Obama has faced. In fact, between the most recent recession’s start (which occurred on President George W. Bush’s watch in December 2007) and its official end (under Obama in June 2009) government employment actually increased by 194,000 jobs, or a little under 1 percent. 
So Obama's claim is way off. Not only did another president experience a decline in government jobs during a recession, but even Obama himself experienced an increase during the recession he inherited. 
There is another way of looking at it, though. 
Has government employment ever gone down previously during a combined recession and recovery? 
You can also look at the combination of the recession and the recovery. April 2012, the latest month for which BLS data is available, represents the 52nd month after the starting date of the last recession, December 2007. In that time span, government payrolls have declined by 407,000, or about 1.8 percent. 
The equivalent month after the start of the 1980 recession is May 1984. Between January 1980 and May 1984, government payrolls fell by 98,000, or 0.6 percent. So counting both the recession itself as well as the length of the current recovery, government jobs did fall in the 1980-1982 recession. 
While the recession that started in 2007 has been more severe, the recession and recovery in 1980-1982 did in fact result in lost jobs. This further undercuts the accuracy of Obama’s statement. 
Has government employment ever gone down previously during a recovery? 
You can also look at recoveries by themselves, ignoring what happened with government jobs when the recession was officially under way. 
If you start counting with the final month of the 1980-1982 recession (November 1982) the numbers of government jobs essentially stagnated for more than a year. In November 1982, the number stood at 15,977,000. Fourteen months later, in January 1984, it had only increased by 33,000, a jump of two-tenths of 1 percent. 
In fact, it took until August 1984 -- 21 months after the end of the recession -- for government employment to once again reach its initial pre-recession level. And it took an additional 11 months for government employment to reach its recession-era peak. This means that government employment finally crawled out of its recession-era hole 32 months after the end of the recession, and a whopping 67 months -- that’s five and a half years -- after the recession began. By then, the economy had improved enough to carry Reagan to a landslide re-election victory. 
By contrast, private-sector jobs began a consistent and years-long rise almost exactly as the recession ended in November 1982 -- more than a year before government jobs began to recover. 
In other words, when Obama says that ""each time there was a recession with a Republican president … we compensated by making sure that government didn't see a drastic reduction in employment,"" he’s not accurate. Reagan hardly rode robust government job growth to a national economic recovery. Quite the contrary: Under Reagan, a huge number of government jobs were lost during the recession, and it took more than a year after the recovery began to even begin making a dent in the government-job deficit from the recession. 
Where Obama has a point 
Obama is correct that government employment did go up under Reagan -- eventually. It just took a while before this expansion gathered steam. In the three years between January 1984 and January 1987, when the broader recovery was already well under way, government employment soared by about 6.4 percent, with consistent month-to-month gains. That’s very healthy growth, but it’s important to note that those government job increases came after the larger economy was back humming along. 
Obama, by contrast, has experienced nothing like that. Government employment did rise modestly during the official recessionary period, government employment peaked in April 2009 (not counting a stretch in mid-2010 when the Census Bureau made a lot of temporary hires). But then it began falling -- severely. Since April 2009, the number of government jobs at all levels has fallen by 706,000, or 3 percent. 
While that’s proportionately smaller than the peak-to-trough decline in government employment in the 1980-1982 recession, government employment in the current recovery shows no signs of starting a sustained increase. At the equivalent point in the recovery from the 1980-1982 recession, government employment had already rebounded by 4 percent. Obama can only dream of such numbers. 
Our ruling 
Obama is wrong when he suggests that ""the only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me."" It's not true if you just look at the recessionary period itself, and it's not true if you look at a combination of the recession and the recovery -- in both cases, it happened during the 1980-1982 recession. And while government employment did eventually go up following the Reagan-era recession, the rise began more than a year after private-sector employment picked up, which negates Obama's argument that his predecessors were able to compensate for weak private-sector job creation with accelerated government hiring. We rate Obama’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973125C0>],/factchecks/2012/may/10/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-government-job-losses-his-watch-/

Rep. Gwen Moore says Gov. Scott Walker gutted tax credits for the poor and elderly
","
Eager for a post-Scott Walker era, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Milwaukee led Democrats in a politicized version of ""Hit the road, Jack"" at the party’s Founder’s Day Gala in April 2012.

""Great Scott, Scott Walker, you gotta go baby. We don’t want you no more,"" she sang, asking those in attendance to join a ""Hit the road, Scott"" refrain.

A video of the song made its way to YouTube (You knew it would, didn’t you?), so anyone could listen to Moore’s verbal walloping of Walker (""My therapist said you can’t internalize the pain"").

Moore closed with a line about Walker’s budget having ""raised taxes on the poor and the elderly by gutting the Earned Income and Homestead Tax Credits.""

""What were you thinkin’ baby?"" Moore said.

Moore and her swaying backup singers -- among them lobbyist Gary Goyke and former Democratic state Rep. Peter Bock, who is married to gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Falk -- seemed a bit, um, out of sync.

But what about the claim of ""gutting"" tax credits that benefit the poor and elderly?

Did Moore hit the right notes on that one?

It was a humorous bit, but it contained a serious claim. And when we spot political humor, we always look for a chance to, well, drain all the humor from it and write a technical piece about the ins and outs of tax policy.

So with apologies to the song’s writer, Percy Mayfield, and Ray Charles, who made it famous, here we go:

On the Walk-O-Meter, we’ve already noted that Walker’s 2011-’13 budget raised taxes on lower and moderate income working families and others by cutting back the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit and the separate Homestead Credit. We gave Walker a Promise Broken, since he had pledged to oppose all tax increases.

But did the cuts amount to a ""gutting"" of the credits?

Asked for backup, Moore’s office pointed us to March 6, 2011  Wisconsin State Journal article headlined, ""Walker budget slashes tax credits that aid poor.""

That certainly suggests a ""gutting.""

But we ran the numbers ourselves, with much help from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, tax experts and the state Department of Revenue.

Homestead Credit

This credit gives renters and homeowners a state income tax break if their incomes and property taxes or rent are low enough to qualify. It can put more than $1,100 back in people’s pockets.

The credit has been around for years. Walker’s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, approved a change that starting in 2010 pegged various eligibility factors -- such as income -- to rise annually with inflation for the first time.

At times over the years the lack of ""indexing"" squeezed eligibility for the credit, as people bumped into the income limit.

In his budget, Walker ended the ""indexing"" of the program after one year. It carried an estimated $13.6 million value over two years -- money that would go to the state and not the homeowners. The move wiped out a projected 7.9 percent rise in the total credits claimed over two years.

The move also meant an erosion in the credit over time because it is tiered and gets smaller as people’s incomes rise.

That can affect, for instance, elderly recipients whose Social Security payments can go up with inflation. Seniors make up about 30 percent of the recipients of the credit.

""For seniors who have been struggling with trying to stay in their homes, the combination of a gradually reduced Homestead Credit and a higher property tax bill could be the straw that pushes them to the decision to sell their home and live elsewhere,"" said Jon Peacock, a budget expert with a liberal advocacy group, the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families.

But the program remains intact as it was for most of its life.

The income limit and maximum property tax or rent are set at the same level in 2011, under Walker’s move, as they were the year before.

Earned Income Tax Credit

This is the state version of the federal Earned Income Tax Credit, which originally was approved by Congress in 1975 to partially offset Social Security taxes and provide an incentive to work. You have to be working to get it, and in a low or moderate income bracket.

The state version (you get a percentage of the federal credit) started in 1989 under Republicans, though some GOP officials -- including Walker -- have criticized it as a redistribution of wealth.

About half the states offer a similar credit. Among those, Wisconsin’s credit is very generous for some families and stingy for others, depending on family size.

More than 268,000 working Wisconsinites claimed the credit in 2010.

Under the budget Walker signed, about 140,000 recipients will see their credits cut.

Walker’s original plan, before legislative action, cut a similar number of credits. At the time, according to a fiscal bureau report, his administration estimated ""approximately 1,000 additional families with 2,400 children would fall below the poverty line due to the changes in the bills.""

Under the final budget, the total payouts will drop an estimated 19 percent, falling from $289 million to $233 million, or by $56 million.

A 19 percent cut is a major change. By comparison, the most-publicized cut in Walker’s budget -- $792 million in state aid to local school districts -- amounted to a 7.4 percent cut.

Here’s the real-world impact in 2011:

The maximum state credit for families with two children fell from
$716 to $562.

The maximum credit for families with three or more children fell from $2,473 to $1,955.

The maximum credit for families with one child was unchanged at $124.

Does that amount to ""gutting"" the credit?

The state Department of Revenue points out that Walker’s move still means the credit is refundable -- even if a family has zero tax liability, they can still get the credit as a refund check. For a majority of recipients, the credit comes in the form of a full or partial tax refund, because the credit exceeds their net tax liability.

Even staunch advocates of the credit think Moore’s ""gutting"" description went too far.

Peacock, the budget expert with Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, thinks the tax increase is significant, but he said it was not a fatal blow as ""gutting"" suggests.

""For low-wage workers with two or more children, the change to the EITC is more like the loss of an appendage than a vital organ,"" Peacock said.  

David Riemer, a former top budget aide to Doyle now at Community Advocates’ Public Policy Institute, argues that Walker’s move made work less attractive and made the tax system less fair. He believes the moves  ""seriously damaged"" the credits.

But he, too, disagreed that Walker ""gutted"" the EITC. The same for the Homestead Credit.

""Both of these important credits remain on the books,"" Riemer wrote in an email.

Our conclusion

(Yes, we know those words are music to your ears.)

In a send-up of the song ""Hit the Road, Jack,"" Moore said Walker’s reduction in two credits meant a ""gutting"" of the tax breaks, which help moderate and lower income working families.

""Gutting,"" in our dictionary, is ""to remove the vital or essential parts.""

While the percentage cut was deep in one of the credits, Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature left them largely intact.

We rate Moore’s claim False.

(And hope we don’t come back to this one no more, no more, no more...)

"['New Jersey', 'Taxes', 'Lou Greenwald']","
Lou Greenwald says New Jersey's property taxes are highest in country
","
New Jersey often ranks high on lists in categories ranging from beach quality to education.

Unfortunately, according to Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald, the state tops another list – one with a particularly dubious ranking.

New Jersey has ""the highest property taxes in the nation and not by a little,"" Greenwald (D-Camden) said in an April 1 interview with Michael Aron on NJTV’s ""On The Record."" ""They are the highest property taxes in the nation, more than double the national average.""

New Jersey having high property taxes isn’t new. But are they more than double the national average? Greenwald’s statement is largely on the money, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

Let’s first explain the source of Greenwald’s data and how tax rankings are reviewed.

Greenwald got his data from a 2009 list compiled by the business-backed Tax Foundation in Washington, DC. The 2009 data shows that New Jersey ranked number one in three key tax metrics: median property taxes paid on homes; taxes as a percentage of home value; and taxes as a percentage of income.

Nick Kasprak, a Tax Foundation analyst and programmer, said taxes as a percentage of home value is ""the most relevant statistic"" of the three because it can apply to most people, ranging from those who own condominiums to those in McMansions.

""It’s a good way of comparing apples to apples across the states,"" Kasprak said of the metric, adding that the Tax Foundation’s numbers are estimates and come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.

So how long has New Jersey worn the highest property taxes banner?

That depends on the metric. We found that New Jersey property taxes have topped the rest of the nation’s at least back to 2004 when looking at median property taxes paid on homes and taxes paid as a percentage of income.

When looking at all three Tax Foundation metrics for years 2004 through 2009, New Jersey’s median property taxes paid on homes was more than triple the national average; more than double the national average for taxes paid as a percentage of income; and at least one and-a-half times the national average for taxes paid as a percentage of home value.

Brigid Callahan Harrison, a professor of political science and law at Montclair State University, said comparing states by property taxes alone is disingenuous because states fund certain needs differently. For example, some states use property taxes to fund education, others do not.

""In reality, we need to look in total at the entire tax burden,"" Harrison said. ""The implication is that New Jerseyans pay the highest taxes in the country, right? That’s what people think. What I’m saying is that New Jersey pays a very high tax burden. What we need to do is look at the total tax burden: gas tax, sales tax, security, user fees, certainly property taxes and sales taxes as well.""

Jon Bramnick, leader of the Assembly Republicans, agreed property taxes are high but credited a slowing of their growth to Gov. Chris Christie’s implementation of a 2-percent property tax cap, changing arbitration procedures for police and firefighters, and other measures.

""We obviously have to have mergers, shared services and consolidations across New Jersey,"" Bramnick said, adding that a bipartisan effort is key. ""These are the factors that you have to have to continue down that road. If you do, you will see a slowing of property taxes.""

Our ruling

Greenwald said in a TV interview that New Jersey has the highest property taxes in the nation, more than double the national average. He was referring to 2009 statistics from the Tax Foundation. Statistics from 2004 through 2008 show the state leads the nation in two of three key metrics, according to the Tax Foundation. New Jersey led in all three metrics in 2009. Greenwald’s overall point is clear: when it comes to property taxes, New Jersey is king. We rate this statement True.

Donnelly says he didn’t vote for Pelosi for Speaker
","
Democrat Joe Donnelly, who will face a tea party-backed candidate in Indiana’s U.S. Senate contest, is having to answer questions about his political loyalties -- specifically to Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader who is a lightning rod of conservative criticism.

Indiana’s Republican Party Chairman, Eric Holcomb, linked Donnelly’s politics to Pelosi’s following an Indiana Democratic Party fundraiser headlined by Pelosi on May 5, 2012.

""Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi – they all have one thing in common and that is records that are out of step with Indiana,"" Holcomb said, according to Indiana Public Media.

Donnelly, who has served in the House since 2006, responded by saying, ""Well, I did not vote for her for speaker and so, you know, my focus is on the Senate race, what we’re doing here and on job creation.""

The Club for Growth, a conservative Washington group backing Donnelly opponent Richard Mourdock, immediately pounced, sending out a statement pointing to Donnelly’s votes for House Speaker in 2007 and 2009.

We decided to sort it out.

About the election

The Senate race in Indiana is getting national attention after Mourdock defeated six-term Sen. Richard Lugar, a Republican known for being willing to work with Democrats. Mourdock, the former Indiana state treasurer, ran on a message demonizing bipartisanship. He beat Lugar by 20 points.

Many political analysts think Democrats have a better chance of winning the seat now that the race pits a tea party conservative against Donnelly, a moderate who favors gun rights and abortion restrictions.

When he ran for re-election in 2010, Donnelly touted his credentials as an independent who opposed Pelosi on immigration and climate legislation.

But did he vote for her?

The Club for Growth cited House records of Donnelly’s votes in 2007 and 2009. They leave no doubt: Donnelly voted for Pelosi to be speaker of the House.

In 2011, however, he pulled his support and voted for Rep. Heath Shuler of North Carolina.

In voting for Shuler, Donnelly said, ""This afternoon, I cast my vote for Representative Heath Shuler of North Carolina for speaker of the House in the 112th Congress. I supported my friend Congressman Shuler over former Speaker Nancy Pelosi during our party's leadership elections in November citing a need for new leadership. This need remains the same. What the voters told us in the 2010 election was that they wanted a change. And I believe a moderate approach with a dedication to working across the aisle, something I know is important to both me and Congressman Shuler, is the best way forward.""

Republicans won a majority in the House in 2010 and elected John Boehner of Ohio to the speaker’s post. Pelosi still won a majority of her colleagues’ support (Shuler received only 11 votes) and was elected House minority leader.

Our ruling

It’s true that in the most recent House election, he voted for someone else. But in the two previous votes -- the ones in which Democrats held a majority and had the power to choose the speaker -- Donnelly supported for Pelosi.

His statement ignored those two votes. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3C63C0>],/factchecks/2012/may/09/joe-donnelly/donnelly-says-he-didnt-vote-pelosi-speaker/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Bill Spelman']","
Bill Spelman says Dominic Chavez is a Rick Perry Republican lobbyist
","
In a mailer we spotted May 8, 2012, Austin City Council member Bill Spelman urges recipients not to be fooled by a challenger.

""Republican lobbyist Dominic ‘Dom’ Chavez is a Rick Perry Republican,"" Spelman says, also asking whether ""we really want"" Chavez to ""push a Rick Perry agenda for Austin"" on the council.

Chavez works for a state agency guided by a board of Perry appointees. Is he also a Republican lobbyist and Perry man?

Spelman’s campaign consultant, David Butts, told us by telephone that Chavez once registered with the state as a lobbyist for the Real Estate Council of Austin, whose mission includes advocacy for the commercial real estate industry.

It’s not a Republican Party group. Reminded too that the mailer does not say Chavez used to be a lobbyist, Butts said: ""Once a lobbyist, always a lobbyist.""

We wondered how to define a Perry Republican, speculating that might be signaled by regular or hefty campaign contributions to Perry, participation in his campaigns as a staff member or volunteer or maybe through an appointment to a board.

Research showed that Chavez does not qualify on any of those grounds.

As backup for Spelman’s claim, Butts said Chavez has mostly voted in Republican primaries and he suspects Chavez voted for Perry’s 2010 re-election. Also, he said, Chavez’s comments as a staff spokesman for the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, entrusted with coordinating programs offered by state colleges and universities, show he’s aligned with the long-time governor.

Armed with Butts’ offerings, we turned to Chavez, who told us he was previously a lobbyist for a non-partisan group while he has voted in both party primaries. ""I don’t call myself a Republican,"" Chavez said. ""I have voted for Democrats and Republicans. I would consider myself a fiscal conservative and Independent.""

Chavez told us in a telephone interview that he registered as a lobbyist at the Texas Ethics Commission to represent the real estate council in the 2005 legislative session, and also lobbied for the council at the city and Travis County government while working in its government affairs section in 2001-02 and from 2003 to 2007, when he went to work for the coordinating board, where he is now the senior external relations director.

A Chavez filing on the ethics commission’s website confirms termination of his lobbyist registration covering 2005, while another document there lists Chavez as a lobbyist from Jan. 26, 2005 through the end of that year. Neither one specifies who he represented, but the address written on the form is the real estate council’s downtown address.

By telephone, real estate council official Nancy McDonald confirmed that Chavez lobbied city government for the group. She said the group did not endorse gubernatorial candidates through his time there and did not endorse Austin City Council candidates either. 
Next, we verified Chavez’s primary voting history.

A word: Texas has open primaries, meaning any voter may participate in either the Democratic or Republican primary, though once a voter joins a primary, they cannot vote in the other party’s runoffs. Unlike some other states, too, Texas does not require a voter to register their political affiliation. So individuals may vote in one primary or the other without explanation.

Chavez said that he voted in Travis County’s 2002 Democratic primary and voted in the 2006, 2008 and 2010 Republican primaries. He said he did not vote in any 2004 primary. That information matched what Butts told us and also a check of voting records on our behalf by Austin political consultant Jeff Smith, who said Chavez registered to vote in the county in 2001. Chavez later told us said he previously voted in California elections.

Calling himself a ""strategic voter,"" Chavez said he voted in the 2002 Democratic primary to support a Travis County commissioner, Karen Sonleitner, and voted in the 2006 Republican primary to back a Texas House hopeful with a focus on veterans issues, Bill Welch. Similarly, Chavez said, he voted in the 2010 GOP primary to support a friend seeking a House seat, Paul Workman.

He said he could not recall why he voted in the 2008 Republican primary but remembers voting for the Republican presidential nominee, U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, that November. He said he has not decided if he’s voting in a 2012 primary.

Chavez has not been a Perry campaign donor, according to a search of campaign finance reports on the ethics commission website, nor has he given a great deal to anyone.

The search indicates that Chavez ponied up less than $260 from mid-2004 through early 2012, spread among a Republican House candidate and four political entities not tied to either party. Welch fielded a $37.36 contribution from Chavez on Oct. 4, 2006; the Building Owners and Managers Association of Austin political action committee fielded $100 on Aug. 3, 2004; and the Small Business PAC took in $104, in two Chavez donations, in May 2006. Finally, Chavez paid $16 to the Northwest Austin Republican Women on April 2, 2012, which Chavez told us paid for lunch one day.

Chavez, a former Army reservist, volunteered one Perry link; he and Perry posed for a photo when the governor visited Texas troops in Iraq. Sending us the 2009 photo, Chavez wrote: ""We were all proud Texans and he was our governor taking time to visit troops in Iraq. No one cared about political party or politics for an event like this.""

Chavez said too he has not always voted for Perry.

He said he could not remember who he voted for in the 2002 election won by Perry. But in November 2006, he said, he voted for Carole Keeton Strayhorn, who ran against Perry as an Independent after winning state office as a Republican. Chavez said he voted for Perry in November 2010, but is unsure if he supported him while casting his ballot in that year’s contested GOP gubernatorial primary. ""I’m not even sure I voted"" on the offices at the top of the primary ballot, he said.

Butts also offered May 2012 messages from the Williamson County and Travis County Republican parties mentioning Chavez’s council candidacy and articles in which Chavez was quoted on behalf of the coordinating board.

Williamson County’s Republican Party invited members to attend a May 3 social hour. The posting says Chavez and two other local candidates had confirmed plans to be there and two other council candidates, not identified, had been invited. Butts told us Spelman was not invited.

Bill Fairbrother, who chairs the Williamson County GOP, said in a telephone interview that he heard before the event that Chavez is ""Republican-friendly,"" though he did not verify that. Informed that Chavez had voted in three of the last four Republican primaries, Fairbrother said that pattern for anyone would suggest he or she ""leans Republican,"" though he said some Republicans would say it takes voting in four or five consecutive GOP primaries to cement that.

The message from Rosemary Edwards, who chairs the Travis County GOP, urges recipients to vote for Chavez and challengers for two other council seats. Her message calls the three the ""more conservative"" candidates.

Andy Hogue, a party spokesman, told us by telephone that the message went out about May 6, 2012. Hogue pointed us to Roger Borgelt, the county party’s vice chairman, who told us by phone that he doesn’t consider Chavez a Republican partly because he has not been a local Republican precinct chair, election judge or the like. Borgelt also parted with Fairbrother’s ""leans Republican"" analysis, saying he would want to know more about a person before concluding they fit in that barrel.

The news articles show Chavez talking about Perry and higher education; one quotes Chavez talking about an executive order from Perry announcing a partnership between the state and the online Western Governors University.

Another story, in the August 28, 2011 Daily Campus, Southern Methodist University’s student newspaper, quotes Chavez, again on behalf of the agency, saying that Texas had made ""great strides"" with a greater share of residents enrolled in college, including more minority students, and more students proving ready for college, based on test scores. Also offered by Butts: A Jan. 27, 2012, news article published in the Austin American-Statesman quoting Chavez as an agency spokesman pointing out Perry’s call for Texas universities to develop $10,000 degree programs.

Our ruling

Chavez voted in the three latest GOP primaries. He voted for Perry in  the 2010 general election, he says, though he also says he preferred another gubernatorial candidate in 2006. Keeping in mind that no one in Texas has to register a political affiliation, it’s reasonable to speculate about his partisan leaning, but there’s no certainty in that. And he calls himself an Independent.

Chavez mentions Perry in his state job, as Spelman’s camp points out. But it strikes us a stretch to presume that someone who speaks for an agency and references the governor’s initiatives or positions is automatically a Perry acolyte. If that were so, then every spokesman or spokeswoman for every agency could be judged the same. That’s unshown.

We can see why someone might suspect Chavez of being a Republican and maybe even a Perry fan. But we see no proof.

Finally, Chavez once lobbied for a non-partisan group and not Republicans, contrary to Spelman’s statement, which also leaves the inaccurate impression that Chavez is a lobbyist now. It’s been years since he lobbied.

We rate Spelman’s claim as False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097210840>],/factchecks/2012/may/09/bill-spelman/bill-spelman-says-dominic-chavez-rick-perry-republ/

Pro-Connie Mack Super PAC says Nelson sides with Obama on Keystone pipeline
","U.S. Rep Connie Mack is fired up about the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a divisive energy project he’s made the heart of his U.S. Senate campaign.

The Republican congressman wants you, the voter, to be mad, too. Specifically, mad at President Barack Obama and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, the ""lockstep liberals"" whom he accuses of holding up the project.

Freedom PAC, a pro-Mack super PAC, is out with an ad that attacks Obama and Nelson over Keystone. (The ad is on the Web; it’s not yet running on television, though.)  

""President Obama said no to the Keystone XL pipeline,"" the ad says. ""That’s saying no to lower gas prices, no to more jobs, no to greater energy security. Sen. Bill Nelson chose to side with President Obama over the people of Florida. Now you have a choice. Connie Mack supports Keystone XL.""

PolitiFact has already debunked misleading claims about the project’s potential to create 20,000 jobs and ""immediately"" lower gas prices.

Nelson’s record on Keystone, though, is new ground.

First, the vitals. We’re talking about a 1,700-mile pipeline that would transport oil sands from Canada to refineries in Texas and Oklahoma. It would shoot off of an existing Keystone pipeline connecting Canada and Illinois (USA Today offered this illustration).

The most controversial part of Keystone XL is the proposed northern route, which environmentalists and some Republican Nebraskans fear may damage sensitive lands and an important aquifer. Business and union groups are on the other side, touting its potential for desperately needed construction jobs and reducing the country’s dependence on Middle Eastern oil.

Because the pipeline crosses an international border, it needs approval from the Obama administration.

Here are the recent, relevant milestones: Nov. 10, 2011: Following mounting pressure from environmentalists, the Obama administration announces it will put off a decision on the permit until 2013, pending more review of environmental implications. Dec. 23, 2011: Obama signs a law temporarily keeping in place lower payroll taxes. It also contains an unrelated Keystone measure, which forces a decision on the permit within 60 days. Jan. 18, 2012: Citing the ""rushed and arbitrary"" two-month deadline, Obama decides not to approve the permit for TransCanada, the principal company behind the pipeline. Obama says his decision ""is not a judgment on the merits of the pipeline."" March 8, 2012: The Senate votes on two Keystone-related amendments on a highway funding bill. Both fail. A Republican-sponsored measure would have circumvented Obama and allowed Congress to authorize the pipeline (failed 56-42). One sponsored by Democrats would have prevented exports of oil from Canada transported via the pipeline (failed 33-65). March 22, 2012: Obama travels to Cushing, Okla., where he announces his approval of the development of the project’s southern leg, which was supposed to start in June anyway. Republicans criticize him, saying the leg does not require presidential approval since it does not cross a national border. May 4, 2012: The State Department announces it has received a new application from TransCanada for the northern segment of the pipeline connecting the Canadian border to an existing pipeline in Steele City, Neb. The department must decide if granting a permit is in the national interest. Contrary to the pro-Mack ad’s ""they killed it"" vibe, the $7-billion project isn’t dead. Construction on the southern part of the pipeline extension is underway, and the State Department will reevaluate TransCanada’s new application for the northern leg.

It’s also hard to gauge Obama’s intentions from his actions. Did he say ""no"" to the pipeline, as the commercial claims from the beginning? Or do his actions really point to ""not now,"" since he has praised parts of it?

Nelson’s actions are also not crystal-clear either, and he has not said much publicly about it.

In December, he joined his colleagues in unanimous approval of a temporary extension of the pay roll tax cuts that included the Republican provision forcing Obama to evaluate the project within two months. But that was less a vote on the merits of Keystone and more about extending payroll tax cuts.

In March, Nelson split his votes on two party-line Keystone amendments. He voted against the GOP-backed measure that would have circumvented several procedures to speed up Keystone. Those include state permitting, national interest determination, environmental impact and tribal sovereignty, said Jason Kowalski, policy director of 350.org, which opposes the project.

But minutes earlier, he voted for the Democratic-inserted provision preventing exports of Keystone oil.

It’s important to note that both amendments were designed to fail. By taking votes anyway, senators could tell voters they tried to move along the job-creating project.

Nelson’s team insists he is for it, with conditions.

In a March statement, Nelson said, ""I support the pipeline – just not in an area where it runs over an entire region’s water supply, which the folks in Nebraska don’t want either. … Additionally, Congress needs to enact a requirement that the oil shipped from Canada must be kept in our domestic supply and not sold to foreign countries.""

The head of Freedom PAC isn’t buying that. Political consultant Matt Williams, who’s in charge of the PAC, said by email that Nelson ""took the position the White House was lobbying senators to take"" when he voted not to expedite the Keystone pipeline. (POLITICO has more background on Obama’s lobbying efforts against the GOP-led amendment, which failed despite 11 Democratic senators thwarting Obama’s wishes and voting to bypass him.)

We asked Kowalski from 350.org for his take on where Nelson stands. He said it’s become a political issue, since Congress doesn’t usually direct regulatory actions on pipelines.

""Sen. Nelson has been consistent with Obama on this issue,"" he said.

Our ruling

Overall, the ad is laden with misleading facts we’ve already checked. The super PAC comes closer to the truth when it says Nelson and Obama are on the same side, but it still lacks details and context for viewers.

First of all, the project isn’t dead. The principal owners just reapplied for a permit. We know that happened after the ad debuted, but it wasn’t really dead then, either.

Nelson says he is for the pipeline, but he did follow Obama’s wishes by voting against expediting the permit in a close, bipartisan Senate vote in March. His record also shows a vote in favor of Keystone, though voters should understand its part of political strategy in an election year.

The bottom line is that neither Nelson nor Obama has come out definitively against the project. They’ve managed to side with environmentalists -- for now -- by taking action against it this year, but the door is open for future support.

We have a rating for statements like this. It’s Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFFF400>],/factchecks/2012/may/09/freedom-pac/pro-connie-mack-super-pac-says-nelson-sides-obama-/
"['Transportation', 'Texas', 'Brigid Shea']","
Austin mayoral hopeful Brigid Shea says incumbent Lee Leffingwell voted for a toll lane on MoPac
","
In a recent Austin mayoral debate, challenger Brigid Shea and incumbent Lee Leffingwell sparred over a plan to expand MoPac Boulevard, with Shea ultimately saying that Leffingwell voted to add a toll lane to the frequently congested north-south expressway. 
We wondered whether Shea was right about Leffingwell’s record. 
First, let’s flash back to their exchange during the debate aired April 16, 2012, by KXAN-TV, Channel 36. 
Shea began by saying the city hasn’t done enough to ease congestion on Austin’s roads. But, she said, one approach she doesn’t support is ""putting toll lanes on MoPac."" Leffingwell responded that the decision to add a toll lane to MoPac (Loop 1) ""has not been made"" and that under the plan in progress, no existing lanes would be tolled. 
The new lane on MoPac ""would be a high occupancy lane,"" Leffingwell said. ""It would be reserved for bus rapid transit and express buses and for registered car pools. It would also facilitate the movement of emergency vehicles such as police, fire and EMS vehicles. There has been some discussion of placing a variable toll on that lane only, not on the rest of MoPac, which would make it usable for folks in their private automobiles to use. It would be a variable-type toll depending on the movement of traffic in that lane to make sure it moves quickly. … If the speed goes down, the toll would go up. If the speed goes up, the toll would go down. That’s under discussion right now, and hopefully, that project will begin in 2014."" 
Shea shot back: ""All the transportation experts that I’ve spoken with have said you might call it an HOV lane, but it’s really a toll lane. And the mayor has voted for it in the three-year TIP transportation plan."" 
Shea was more blunt in a recent mailer to voters, saying: ""Lee voted for a toll lane on MoPac."" 
Over the years, various ideas have been floated to relieve congestion on MoPac, which opened in the 1970s. The current plan — to be built and operated by the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority, with most of the funding from the Texas Department of Transportation — includes adding an ""express lane"" to each side of MoPac for the approximately 11-mile stretch from Lady Bird Lake north to Parmer Lane. 
At the debate, Leffingwell described the additional lanes as ""high occupancy."" Then again, the MoPac express lanes wouldn’t be the same as the ""high occupancy vehicle,"" or HOV, lanes found in some urban areas. Often called ""car-pool lanes,"" they are typically reserved for vehicles carrying more than one or two people; some allow solo drivers to use them if they pay a toll. 
But Central Texas never adopted the HOV strategy, according to a Jan. 30, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article, ""and the MoPac express lanes won’t change that."" Instead, as Leffingwell indicated, the additional northbound and southbound lanes would be open — for no charge — to transit buses, registered vanpools and emergency and military vehicles. Everyone else who wanted to hop in the express lane would have to pay a toll, the amount of which would change minute by minute depending on the level of traffic in the lane. 
The article quoted Mike Heiligenstein, executive director of the mobility authority, as saying that the point of the fluctuating tolls is to keep the speeds in each express lane at 50 mph or more. 
While there are no MoPac toll lanes yet, construction could start as early as 2013, according to an April 2, 2012, Statesman news article. The project is expected to receive final environmental clearance from the federal government around August 2012, which would trigger a six-month period in which approval can be challenged in court. 
We wondered how Leffingwell factored into the toll-lane plan. 
Shea told us that she was referring to three votes Leffingwell cast in 2010 as a board member for the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization. That’s a regional body whose primary jobs, according to its website, are to coordinate regional transportation planning and to approve the use of federal transportation funds within the region. 
The 19-member CAMPO board is made up mostly of local elected officials from Travis, Williamson, Hays, Bastrop and Caldwell counties. CAMPO director Maureen McCoy told us that Leffingwell, who was elected mayor in 2009 and was a council member before that, joined the board in 2008. 
To back up her claim, Shea sent us copies of the minutes of CAMPO board meetings that struck us as showing that Leffingwell did vote for toll lanes on MoPac. 
Let’s look closer:

** Vote No. 1: On May 24, 2010, the board voted to adopt Central Texas’ 25-year transportation plan, with Leffingwell and 16 others voting ""aye."" The plan, which is required under federal law, undergoes a top-to-bottom rewrite every five years. Any road or transit project that uses federal money, as most of them do, must be in the plan to qualify for that money. 
A May 10, 2010, Statesman news article previewing the vote said the proposed CAMPO 2035 plan contained several hundred road, rail, bicycle and pedestrian projects projected to cost nearly $30 billion. It noted that in the plan was $392 million for a new ""managed lane"" in each direction on MoPac from Parmer Lane in North Austin to Slaughter Lane in South Austin. 
The plan that the board approved in May 2010 includes the MoPac ""managed lanes"" project in its ""priority project list."" And a separate chart in the plan lists the MoPac project in a section labeled ""toll roads and toll express lanes."" 
Several months after the vote, in July 2010, state and local officials announced that the proposed MoPac project, with express toll lanes between Parmer Lane and the river, was moving forward after delays of several years, according to a July 8, 2010, Statesman news article. 
** Vote No. 2: On Aug. 9, 2010, the CAMPO board voted to adopt the 2011-2014 Transportation Improvement Program, a short-term document that designates projects to be carried out over the next four years and how they will be funded. (Shea erred slightly in the debate by describing it as a three-year document.) Leffingwell was among the 16 board members who voted for the plan, which included the ""managed lanes"" project for MoPac between Parmer Lane and the river. 
In a telephone interview, we asked McCoy, the CAMPO director, whether she considered Leffingwell’s 2010 votes for the long-range plan and the TIP as votes to add a toll lane to MoPac. She said yes, saying that the projects had been discussed for some time. 
** Vote No. 3: On Sept. 13, 2010, the board voted 13-4, with Leffingwell’s support, to approve the ""terms and conditions"" for the MoPac express lane project, as required by state law. 
According to a summary in the agenda for that meeting, the ""terms and conditions,"" developed by the mobility authority and TxDOT, establish that the project would add an express lane in the Parmer-to-the-river stretch of MoPac ""consistent with the CAMPO 2035 Regional Transportation Plan and the current Transportation Improvement Program."" They also establish that the toll rate for the project would be ""variable based on traffic demand with a minimum rate of 22 cents per mile"" and that emergency, military and transit vehicles would be exempt. Finally, it notes that the toll rates would increase annually based on the ""Consumer Price Index for Urban Areas."" 
As we closed out this review, Andy Mormon, Leffingwell’s city chief of staff, said in a telephone interview that to describe the MoPac project’s ""managed lanes"" as ""toll lanes"" oversimplifies a complex traffic solution project. 
He also suggested that Shea’s claim leaves out critical context in that under the regional plan, drivers could continue using MoPac without paying tolls. ""When you say toll lane in Austin, there’s a lot of people who get up in arms,"" he said. 
Our ruling 
During the debate, Shea responded to Leffingwell’s description of the plan to add a managed lane to each side of a stretch of MoPac by calling it a toll lane and saying Leffingwell had voted for it in a transportation plan. Our conclusion is that except for a select few kinds of motorists, drivers who use the new lanes would have to pay varying tolls. And Leffingwell voted for this approach thrice. 
Shea did not say MoPac would be entirely tolled. Her comment had the context already given at the debate by the mayor. We rate her claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809711FE00>],/factchecks/2012/may/09/brigid-shea/austin-mayoral-hopeful-brigid-shea-says-incumbent-/
"['City Government', 'Texas', 'Shaun Ireland']","
Shaun Ireland says no Austin City Council member lives south of Lady Bird Lake or north of 45th Street
","
Austin City Council candidate Shaun Ireland recently claimed, in his campaign video among several from candidates posted on the city’s website, ""Not a single City Council member lives in South Austin. Nor in North Austin.""

In May 2011, we looked at a candidate’s statement that ""there’s no one from South Austin on the council,"" and found that was True.

Only one face on the council has changed since then, but what about their current home addresses?

Ireland, who himself lives on Manchaca Road in the South Lamar neighborhood of South Austin, told us by email that he pulled council members’ addresses from their personal financial statements filed with the city, and sent us his findings.

Meanwhile, in an Austin American-Statesman news story published online May 7, 2012, he narrowed his claim, saying that ""no council member lives south of (Lady Bird Lake) or north of 45th Street.""

We called council members’ city and campaign staff for the most up-to-date information.

Ireland’s opponent, Place 6 incumbent and Mayor Pro Tem Sheryl Cole, is one of two council members who live in East Austin -- Cole in Wilshire Woods and Mike Martinez in Senate Hills.

Mayor Lee Leffingwell lives in the Highland Park West/Balcones Area neighborhood. Laura Morrison resides in Old West Austin, Chris Riley is downtown and Bill Spelman hails from Hyde Park. The council’s newest member, Kathie Tovo, lives north of the University of Texas in the Heritage neighborhood.

All the addresses are north of Lady Bird Lake. Are they all south of 45th Street?

This is where Ireland’s claim gets interesting, because 45th Street does not extend across the entire city. It’s not oriented directly east-west, either.

But if you drew a line extending 45th Street across the entire city map, Martinez and Leffingwell’s homes would both lie less than a mile north of that line.

Ireland told us, ""All City Council members live within six miles of each other … none live south of downtown or north of Koenig (Lane) -- magnetic north, true north, or past the 45th street parallel, whichever the case may be. There are no council members that reside in the Arboretum or near Parmer and Metric, or Onion Creek or the ‘Y’ at Oak Hill.""

Our ruling

No council members live in South Austin, as Ireland says, and five council members live south of 45th Street. If that street were extended east and west, though, Leffingwell and Martinez would land north of it, though not by much. We rate Ireland’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978C5280>],/factchecks/2012/may/09/shaun-ireland/shaun-ireland-says-no-austin-city-council-member-l/
"['New Jersey', 'Congress', 'Elections', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie said New Jersey hasn’t sent a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 40 years
","History bodes poorly for Republican Senate hopefuls in New Jersey.

That’s because Richard Nixon was gearing up for a second term in the White House the last time New Jersey voters sent a GOP candidate to the U.S. Senate, according to Gov. Chris Christie.

""We are coming up on our 40th anniversary of electing a Republican to the United States Senate. 1972 was the last time New Jersey sent a Republican to the United States Senate,"" Christie said in a May 4 speech at an event held by the libertarian Cato Institute.  

New Jersey’s presence in the House of Representatives remains relatively bipartisan. But have four decades passed since the state elected a Republican to the Senate?

Outside of an eight-month stint by a Republican appointed in 1982, Democrats have held both Senate seats for more than three decades, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

Clifford Case was the last Republican that New Jersey voters elected to the Senate, in 1972. That year he started his fourth term. He lost a bid for re-election in the 1978 GOP primary to Jeffrey Bell.

Bill Bradley, a Democrat, defeated Bell in the 1978 general election, starting decades of Democratic dominance of New Jersey’s Senate seats.

At least one Republican from New Jersey had served in the Senate in the 40 years leading up to Bradley’s victory, but Democrats have won every Senate election since then. Even in 1982 after Democrat Harrison Williams was forced from office for convictions on bribery and conspiracy charges as part of a federal corruption probe.

A Republican briefly held Williams’ seat, but he was appointed, not elected.

Then-Gov. Tom Kean  in 1982 picked Republican Nicholas Brady to fill in for Williams, whose term ended the next year. Brady stepped down, however, after Frank Lautenberg won in the general election, defeating Republican Millicent Fenwick. Kean appointed Lautenberg to complete the final days of the term.

Lautenberg started his first full term in January 1983 and served three six-year terms before leaving Washington, D.C. when he decided not to seek re-election.

But he returned to Capitol Hill two years later in 2003 after replacing fellow Democrat Robert Torricelli on the ballot. Torricelli, who had served one term, quit his re-election bid in 2002 a month before voters headed to the polls because of questions about his ethics. Torricelli was reprimanded by the Senate Ethics Committee earlier that year over gifts he accepted from a campaign contributor.

Lautenberg is serving his fifth term and is up for re-election in 2014.  Robert Menendez, a Democrat, also represents New Jersey in the Senate.

In 2006, Menendez replaced Jon Corzine, when the then-first-term Senator Corzine  was elected New Jersey’s governor. Menendez won a full term to the Senate later that year. He is up for re-election this November against Republican Joe Kyrillos, who Christie has endorsed.

Our ruling

Christie said: ""We are coming up on our 40th anniversary of electing a Republican to the United States Senate. 1972 was the last time New Jersey sent a Republican to the United States Senate.""

In 1972, New Jersey sent Republican Clifford Case to the U.S. Senate to serve a fourth term.

Since then, New Jersey voters have not elected another GOP candidate to the Senate. And though a Republican from New Jersey briefly served in the Senate in 1982, he was appointed, not elected.

We rate Christie’s statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c878bd49-4149-4aa0-81b1-9293c0da3700",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4B2780>],/factchecks/2012/may/09/chris-christie/chris-christie-said-new-jersey-hasnt-sent-republic/

State Sen. Nia Gill claims New Jersey has not had a Democratic congresswoman in nearly 40 years
","
New Jersey has a long-standing reputation as a Democratic state, but not since the late 1970s has a Democratic woman represented the Garden State as a member of Congress.

State Sen. Nia Gill pointed out that history in an interview Monday on NJToday about her bid for the 10th Congressional District seat previously held by the late Donald Payne. Gill is one of the Democrats running in the June 5 primary to represent the district, which spans Essex, Hudson and Union counties.

""There has not been a Democratic woman in Congress from New Jersey in almost four decades,"" said Gill, who is African-American. ""There has never been an African-American woman ever elected to Congress from the State of New Jersey.""

While a Republican congresswoman represented New Jersey as recently as 10 years ago, Gill is right that a Democratic woman from the state has not served in Congress since U.S. Rep. Helen Stevenson Meyner served two terms from 1975 to 1979, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

Gill is one of six Democratic women seeking their party’s nomination on June 5 for four congressional seats throughout New Jersey. Democratic candidates for the other eight seats are all men.

The state’s current congressional delegation includes six Democrats and six Republicans, but no women. The seat held by Payne, who was a Democrat, remains vacant. 
First, let’s talk about the history of New Jersey women serving in Congress.

Five women -- including three Republicans and two Democrats -- have represented New Jersey in Congress. The first representative was Democrat Mary T. Norton, known as ""Battling Mary,"" who served 12 terms between 1925 and 1951.

The other representatives and their years of service are as follows: Florence P. Dwyer (R), 1957-1973; Helen Stevenson Meyner (D), 1975-1979; Millicent Fenwick (R), 1975-1983; and Marge Roukema (R), 1981-2003.

Now, we’ll discuss the service of Meyner, the last Democratic congresswoman.

Meyner -- who was married to former New Jersey Gov. Robert Meyner -- first ran for Congress in 1972, when the original Democratic nominee withdrew from the race for failing to meet the federal citizenship requirement. At the time, that congressional district spanned Hunterdon, Sussex, Warren, Mercer and Morris counties.

That year, Meyner lost to Republican Joseph J. Maraziti, but she defeated Maraziti in the 1974 election. Meyner narrowly won re-election in 1976 over Republican challenger William Schluter.

During her four years in Congress, Meyner ""developed a reputation as a thoughtful internationalist and advocate of human rights issues,"" according to her profile on the House website, ""Women in Congress.""

Meyner was a critic of the nuclear arms race as well as human rights abuses in the Philippines. She opposed attempts to suspend or expel Israel from the United Nations.

Meyner also helped to prevent her district’s Picatinny Arsenal from shutting down and sought to sustain the state’s ailing textile industry. ""In her first term, she supported legislation that aided destitute women, including a vote to provide federal funding for abortions through Medicare,"" according to her profile.

However, in the face of high inflation, rising gas prices and a lagging economy, Meyner lost her bid for a third term in 1978. She was defeated by Republican James A. Courter by just under 5,500 votes.

To learn more about Meyner’s service, check out her complete profile here.

Our ruling

In an interview Monday on NJToday, Gill claimed: ""There has not been a Democratic woman in Congress from New Jersey in almost four decades.""

That history lesson is accurate, because the last Democratic congresswoman from New Jersey was Meyner, who served two terms between 1975 and 1979. The most recent congresswoman from either party was Marge Roukema, a Republican who left office in 2003.

We rate the statement True.

Linking crime to casinos not always a safe bet
","
  
Developer Dan O’Leary is pushing a big idea that he says will bring scores of jobs and truckloads of money to Georgia.

The state’s most powerful political leaders, however, don’t like his plan -- a casino-style entertainment complex with video lottery terminals that could be a source of lottery revenue for the state’s HOPE scholarship program.

One group offered another reason to fight O’Leary’s plan that had the Truth-O-Meter spinning like a roulette wheel.

The Georgia Family Council put together a fact sheet that said crime will increase if any form of casino-style gambling is allowed. PolitiFact Georgia thought it would be interesting to see if the council was gambling with the facts with its claim.

O’Leary, part of a team that operates Underground Atlanta, wants to build the complex near the busy I-85 interchange at Jimmy Carter Boulevard in Gwinnett County.

At one meeting last month, the Gwinnett-based council presented an argument why O’Leary’s plan is not a good idea. Some of the crime statistics included:

""A city can expect its crime rate to increase by 8 percent within four to five years of introducing casinos.""

""After casinos opened in Atlantic City, the total number of crimes within a 30-mile radius increased 100 percent.""

Much of the research on crime and casinos was done slightly more than a decade ago when more states permitted casinos. Some experts say most of the reports are flawed.

The council’s policy analyst, Toby Tatum, sent us several reports to back up the organization’s claim. Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations firm representing O’Leary, sent us information to support that side. PolitiFact Georgia took a look at their reports, and some research we found ourselves.

It’s been generally believed that casinos result in more crime in the surrounding community, primarily because of concerns about organized crime. In the 1990s, experts said in one report that for each dollar in legalized gambling, there is a similar amount in illegal gambling. There have been occasional news reports of cases like gamblers committing insurance fraud to get more money to feed their addiction or stories of people embezzling money from their employer for gambling.

A 2004 Department of Justice-sponsored study found pathological gamblers more likely to be arrested for such offenses as probation or parole violations, liquor law violations, trespassing and other public order offenses. There’s evidence that casinos may have an impact in less likely areas, such as driving under the influence. One Journal of Health Economics report found there is a higher percentage (9.2 percent) of DUI fatalities in counties with casinos. They are more likely to occur in rural counties, but less likely in urban areas.

In 1999, a federal panel released what was considered the most comprehensive study on casinos in America in a quarter-century. The National Gambling Impact Study Commission wrote there is insufficient data to determine whether casinos cause more crime.

""The problem is that although a great deal has been written on the subject, so much of the writing on all sides is bombast and blather that it is difficult to discern any strong facts,"" the report said.

Still, the commission concluded: ""Taken as a whole, the literature shows that communities with casinos are just as safe as communities that do not have casinos.""

One of the most widely discussed studies on the topic was released in 2001 and co-authored by University of Georgia associate economics professor David Mustard. The study found some crime could decline because more less-skilled workers get jobs working at casinos and that the casinos improve economically depressed locations. Conversely, it found crime may rise because casinos draw unsavory characters and some compulsive gamblers commit crime to get more money to gamble.

The study covered all 3,165 U.S. counties from 1977-1996. The study concluded that casinos increased all crimes except murder. Most offenses showed that the impact of casinos on crime began about three years after a casino opened. Eight percent of property crime and 10 percent of violent crime in counties with casinos was due to the presence of a casino, the study found.

More recent news accounts of crime and casinos offer support to both sides of the debate.

The Press of Atlantic City reported in September that the violent crime rate there was highest among the top-ranked gaming markets in the U.S., according to an analysis of 2010 federal crime statistics. Police Department leaders in that city and some researchers note that the Atlantic City statistics do not consider that the crime rate is based on its population of 39,000, rather than the 29 million visitors the city sees each year.

In February, The Associated Press examined crime rates in areas near two large Connecticut casinos opened in the 1990s: the Foxwoods Resort and Mohegan Sun. The news organization looked at crime rates for several years before they opened and afterward and reported crime dropped by double-digit percentages in the nearby municipalities compared to the years before the casinos opened — mirroring a drop in crime nationwide.

Few gambling facilities, though, are similar to what O’Leary has in mind in Georgia. The most frequent comparison is Dover Downs, located in Delaware. Dover Downs is one of the few casinos with video lottery terminals, which resemble slot machines.

Jim Hutchison, a former Dover mayor and retired Dover police chief, worried about crime and other unruly elements when the state approved casino gambling in the mid-1990s.

""It's nice to say that after all the years they've been operating here in Delaware, specifically Dover Downs, all those concerns I had are truly unfounded,"" Hutchison, who has testified to Georgia lawmakers on behalf of Dover Downs, the city's biggest taxpayer, told the AJC in March.

There is some research that shows crime does increase in communities with casinos. There are some reports, such as the AP investigation, that show a drop in crime in some communities with casinos. The anecdotal evidence from Hutchison suggests crime hasn’t increased since Dover Downs opened.

To say the least, the evidence is mixed. Crime has gone down in some areas with casinos. It has increased in others.

But there does appear to be some truth to the council’s claim, though it needs a lot of context to move the needle higher on the Truth-O-Meter.

We rate the council’s claim as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976EF300>],/factchecks/2012/may/09/georgia-family-council/linking-crime-casinos-not-always-safe-bet/

NRCC says Betty Sutton supported rioting at Occupy Wall Street event
","
Republicans moved quickly to politicize what federal agents have described as a failed bomb plot cooked up by anarchists connected to the Occupy Cleveland organization.

The group, an offshoot of last fall’s anti-Wall Street demonstrations in New York, is not under investigation, officials stressed May 1, 2012,  when announcing the arrests of five suspects.

But that did little to stop the GOP from buzzing about the movement’s support among Democrats.

The most direct attack came May 2, 2012, from the National Republican Congressional Committee. The group is working to unseat Rep. Betty Sutton, a Democrat from Copley Township near Akron. Redistricting put her into battle this fall against fellow Rep. Jim Renacci of Wadsworth.

In an email, the NRCC blasted Sutton for not immediately denouncing the accused anarchists and noted that the congresswoman attended an Occupy rally last October in New York.

The email, sent by NRCC Deputy Communications Director Andrea Bozek, accuses Sutton of missing votes to protest with Occupy Wall Street and being slow to criticize the ""plot by Occupy members to blow up an Ohio bridge.""

Bozek then delivered the punchy email’s parting shot.

""Sutton’s cowardly silence shows she would rather riot with Occupy than stand up for Ohio families.""

When it comes to Occupy, it’s no secret Sutton has been a supporter. But a rioter?

PolitiFact Ohio decided to check that accusation.

Bozek provided a link to a story that was published last October in The Plain Dealer and online at Cleveland.com. The story reported on Sutton’s travel to the Occupy rally in New York.

Bozek also shared an NRCC video montage of Occupy protesters preaching communism and engaging in other unruly behavior. An oft-used image of a man defecating on a police car makes a cameo. The video targets another congressional Democrat, Steve Israel of New York.

Asked if any of the clips came from the event Sutton attended, Bozek replied: ""That video demonstrates the kind of behavior that defines this radical group. Multiple arrests, sexual assaults, attacks on police officers and … vandalism. Is that what Betty Sutton supports?""

""The congresswoman does not ever condone or participate in riotous behavior,"" said Sutton spokesman Anthony DeAngelo.

The New York rally last fall is the only Occupy event Sutton has attended, DeAngelo told PolitiFact Ohio. We checked news reports from that day and found little to support the NRCC’s attack.

Yes, there were violent outbursts -- an element necessary to meet nearly any modern definition of riot. The New York Times City Room blog reported that 23 people were arrested during the Oct. 5 protests, including one charged with second-degree riot -- a misdemeanor.

According to New York penal code, rioting in the second degree occurs when someone in a group of at least four ""engages in tumultuous and violent conduct,"" risking ""public alarm.""

But we suspect the New York Times would have noted an Ohio congresswoman among the group had Sutton been involved. But the newspaper didn’t because Sutton wasn’t. DeAngelo offered a few photos of his boss at the rally. Sutton appears more dressed up than her fellow demonstrators, and her dark coat and purple blouse look no worse for the wear.

Most coverage of the Oct. 5 protests indicated that violent behavior was the exception. That evening, on CNN’s broadcast of ""Situation Room,"" reporter Susan Candiotti agreed with host Wolf Blitzer that the protests had been peaceful and that ""there have been no confrontations.""

The NRCC is correct that Sutton missed votes to attend the rally last October. It is also accurate to say that Sutton did not send out a formal condemnation of the five bomb plot suspects, though, in fairness, neither did Renacci until after the NRCC attack.

But the rhetorical flourish is where the NRCC’s claim departs from truthfulness. The NRCC email said that Sutton’s ""cowardly silence shows she would rather riot with Occupy than stand up for Ohio families.""

Did Sutton stand with the Occupy Wall Street protesters in October? Yes.

Did she engage in rioting? No. 
Was there even rioting at the rally Sutton attended? News coverage indicates violent behavior was the exception and that protests at the event were generally peaceful. Meanwhile, the material provided by the NRCC fails to support the notion that Sutton would support rioting.

The NRCC claim is beyond False.  On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B9D2C0>],/factchecks/2012/may/09/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-betty-sutton-supports-occupy-wall-street/

Anti-abortion group says Obama White House screens unborn babies
","
The National Right to Life Committee cried foul on Tuesday after it obtained an email from an Obama administration aide asking future White House visitors to provide information about their unborn babies.

In a news release, the anti-abortion group said the policy was hypocritical because of the Obama administration's support for abortion rights.

""Obama White House recognizes ‘baby that has not been born’ for White House security purposes, but tolerates legal abortion to moment of birth in District of Columbia,"" the May 8, 2012, news release said.

The release was a response to an early-morning email from the White House Visitors Office detailing how to record the personal information of babies still in utero.

""Crazy as it may sound, you MUST include the baby in the overall count of guests in the tour. It’s an easy process,"" Visitors Office director Ellie Schafer wrote to congressional staffers, specifying that nine zeros should be filled in for the infant’s Social Security Number.

We confirmed that the email really did come from Schafer and is unaltered. But its meaning was wildly misconstrued. The National Right to Life Committee headline suggested that fetuses were being screened for security at the White House gate, while a Washington Times story said, ""The pro-choice Obama White House requires pregnant visitors to count their unborn child as a person for tours of the executive mansion."" Numerous conservative websites also picked up the story. Creative Minority Report ran it under the headline ""Pro-Abort White House Counts Unborn as People on Tours.""

The email

The confusion began with an early morning email to staffers on Capitol Hill. Schafer wrote that her office has received ""a number of calls regarding how to enter security information for a baby that has not yet been born.""

She provided detailed instructions on how to fill out the security information: 
The baby’s security information should be entered as follows: 
LAST NAME: The family’s last name 
FIRST NAME: ""Baby"" as a first name 
MIDDLE NAME: NMN as in No Middle Name 
DOB: Use the date you are submitting the request to us as their birthday 
GENDER: if the parents know put that gender down if not, you can enter either M or F as we’ll ask you to update it at the time of birth 
SOCIAL: As they will not have a SSN and are under 18, you will not need to enter this field.  Again if the spreadsheet asked for a social enter 9 zero’s (not the word nine zeros but 000000000 and yes it happens!) 
CITIZEN/CITY/STATE: The citizen, city and state should be entered the same as the parents 
Once the baby is born, you should send an email to the VO inbox with the tour request ID number, the baby’s given name, their actual birthday and gender. We can then update the newborn guest’s information within our system. Please note that any changes to security information for newborns must be made at least 48 hours in advance. 

She closed saying, ""Keep being awesome!""

The Right to Life Committee and some conservative websites said the email indicated the White House was recognizing that fetuses were relevant for security.

The Right to Life Committee’s legislative director, Douglas Johnson, said in the press release, ""It is ironic that President Obama's staff recognizes the existence of unborn babies for purposes of providing security within the White House -- yet, there is no indication that President Obama has any problem with the fact that throughout the District of Columbia, abortion is now legal for any reason up to the moment of birth,"" Johnson said. ""Notably, the newsletter provides no guidance on what the staff should do if an unborn baby is first registered for security purposes, but then aborted.""

But is the Right to Life Committee correct that an unborn child has been recognized for security purposes? In other words, does a pregnant woman count as two at the White House?

Ed Donovan, spokesman for the U.S. Secret Service, said people misunderstood the email. Schafer’s email, he said, was an explanation of how to fill out information for pregnant women who will bring their new baby on future White House tours.

""This refers to a pregnant woman providing information for a tour in the future that will include the new family member. So when a 7-month pregnant woman is providing information for a tour that is 4 months in the future, there is a ‘place holder’ for the new baby,"" Donovan wrote in an email.

In a phone call, he acknowledged the procedure may seem ""a little anal.""

""I know people are construing it as an unborn child, but the visit isn’t occurring (now). If a pregnant woman shows up at the White House, we don’t count two people. It’s sort of a way of expediting (the process) so no one gets hung up at the gate,"" he said.

Our ruling

The National Right to Life Committee said that the White House recognizes a ""baby that has not been born"" for security purposes.

It collects that information, but not for the reasons Right to Life suggests. The White House policy does not confer personhood status on fetuses, and it doesn’t count them if their mothers take a tour while pregnant. The policy helps pinpoint the headcount for future tours.

The statement is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F2B340>],/factchecks/2012/may/08/national-right-life-committee/obama-white-house-security-unborn-babies/

'Life of Julia' says Romney refused to say if he would sign equal pay law
","
Updated Thursday, October 25th, 2012 at 2:08 p.m. 
Equal pay is just one reason Julia, a character created by the Obama campaign, would be better off under the president than under Mitt Romney, a Web graphic claims.

The cartoon ""The Life of Julia,"" compares the candidates' impact on Julia at a dozen points in her life.  At age 23, she’s shown reading a newspaper with the headline, ""Equal pay 4 equal work."" She’s starting her career as a Web designer.

""Because of steps like the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, Julia is one of millions of women across the country who knows she’ll always be able to stand up for her right to equal pay,"" the graphic says.

Romney, on the other hand, ""has refused to say whether he would have vetoed or signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act,"" the graphic says.

We wondered: Did Romney refuse to say whether he would have vetoed or signed the act? And what would that mean for Julia?

Obama’s first law

The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the first bill signed by President Barack Obama on Jan. 29, 2009, made it easier for workers to pursue wage discrimination claims. Just seven Republicans voted for the bill.

It updated 1960s civil rights and age discrimination laws to reset the statute of limitations on such claims with each new paycheck. In 2007, the Supreme Court had ruled in Ledbetter vs. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. that the 180-day statute of limitations started from the day an employer made the decision to discriminate — making it harder for employees who claimed such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay.

Just what did Romney have to say about the law? We asked the Romney and Obama campaigns and conducted our own search.

Romney’s campaign didn’t respond, but the Obama campaign pointed us to a Washington Post blog post and an ABC News interview. 
The Washington Post report by Greg Sargent, the week before the ABC News interview, was based on an April 11, 2012,  conference call between Romney advisers and reporters.

In a clip, Sam Stein, a political reporter at the Huffington Post, asks, ""Does Gov. Romney support the Lilly Ledbetter Act?""

A Romney adviser answers, ""Sam, we’ll get back to you on that.""

Sargent, in his blog post, cites a TPM report that Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul later clarified in an email: ""He supports pay equity and is not looking to change current law.""

So, Romney’s advisers didn’t say ""whether he would have vetoed or signed"" the act. But it’s a stretch to say he ""refused"" to say — the question wasn’t about whether he would have vetoed or signed the law, but whether he supported it.

What about the ABC News interview?

On April 16, 2012, reporter Diane Sawyer asked Romney, "" If you were president — you had been president — would you have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Law?""

Here’s how Romney responded:
  
ROMNEY: ""It's certainly a piece of legislation I have no intention of changing. I wasn't there three years ago —"" 
SAWYER: ""But would you have signed it?"" 
ROMNEY: ""... I'm not going to go back and look at all the prior laws and say had I been there which ones would I have supported and signed, but I certainly support equal pay for women and — and have no intention of changing that law, don't think there's a reason to."" 

In this case, Romney did refuse to say whether he would have signed the bill. But he also said he supported ""equal pay for women"" and had ""no intention of changing that law.""

Those news reports were consistent with others we found.

Our ruling

The Obama campaign said Romney ""has refused to say whether he would have vetoed or signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act."" That’s essentially what happened in Romney’s ABC News interview in April, but the claim leaves out some details that matter to Julia. 
The relevant point for Julia isn't whether Romney would sign the bill — it's already the law — but his decision not to change it. Romney also said he  ""certainly support(s) equal pay for women,"" and has ""no intention of changing that law.""

Still, the Obama campaign is correct that he dodged the question, so we rate the claim Mostly True. 
CORRECTION: A previous version of this item said the Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision made it ""impossible for employees who learned of such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay."" In fact, the court declined to address the question of whether employees who learned of discrimination after the statute of limitations expired would be protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",[<zip object at 0x000002809773C840>],/factchecks/2012/may/08/barack-obama/life-julia-says-romney-refused-say-if-he-would-sig/

Obama says Romney would cut his own taxes while raising others’
","
President Barack Obama says Mitt Romney is the anti-Robin Hood.

In a campaign speech in Columbus, Ohio, on May 5, 2012, Obama said the Romney's economic plan would raise taxes for millions of low-income Americans while cutting them for the wealthy. Obama told the crowd that Romney ""doesn’t seem to understand"" that helping the rich doesn’t automatically trickle down to benefit the poor.

""Why else would he want to spend trillions more on tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Why else would he propose cutting his own taxes while raising them on 18 million working families?"" Obama said.

Romney's tax plan, unveiled in February, includes a repeal of the estate tax, a decrease in the corporate tax rate and a 20 percent across-the-board rate cut for all personal income tax brackets. So how is it that some people’s taxes would actually increase under his plan? We decided to check it out.

How Romney would pay less

We contacted the Romney campaign for more details on his tax plan but did not hear back. So we're relying on the Romney campaign's description of the tax plan and the analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a well-respected independent group. 
Romney’s tax plan would affect what he personally pays in federal income taxes. With a fortune estimated at between $80 million and $250 million and 2010 earnings of around $21 million, Romney falls in the top tax bracket. That class currently pays a 35 percent rate. His plan would reduce that to 28 percent.

""The tax plan would cut taxes on the rich a lot,"" said Roberton Williams, an economist with the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution think tanks that published an analysis of Romney’s plan.

The 20 percent cut, Williams said, is ""a huge savings for the people at the top end.""

How others could pay more

Romney’s tax plan also allows the expiration of tax cuts enacted in the economic stimulus package, including:

The American Opportunity Tax Credit raises the maximum education tax credit from $1,800 to $2,500 and it makes the credit partially refundable so low-income people who don’t pay any taxes would still benefit.

The stimulus bill also increased the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income working families from 40 percent to 45 percent. An extension enacted in 2010 increased the maximum credit for families with three or more children from $5,236 to $5,891 in 2011.

The child credit, a tax benefit to offset the cost of raising a child, is a partially refundable credit of up to $1,000 per child. Recent legislation lowered the threshold for qualifying, so that working families with earnings above $3,000 qualify for at least a partial credit.

These tax cuts provide substantial cuts for low-income taxpayers. And since Romney’s plan would allow them to expire, that’s who would see a tax increase under his proposal. (We are defining ""working families"" as tax filers or non-filers who receive a benefit from those tax cuts.) 
The Tax Policy Center said Romney’s plan would raise taxes on about 11 percent of  tax filers (or those too poor to file and pay taxes) by an average of about $900 in 2015. With 165 million filers in the U.S., that’s about 18 million people, as Obama said.

Said Williams: ""Because he would not extend the Obama tax cuts, the people at the bottom who were benefiting from those cuts would see their taxes go up.""

It’s worth noting that overall, most people’s taxes would decrease under Romney’s plan. The Tax Policy Center said that 70 percent would get tax cuts averaging almost $4,300 -- a result of the 20 percent rate cut.

Our ruling

Obama claimed Romney’s plan would cut his own taxes while raising them on 18 million working families.

The Tax Policy Center found that, indeed, even with a 20 percent rate cut, 18 million people would find themselves in a gap where the rate cut wouldn’t offset the loss of benefits from the Obama tax cuts Romney would let expire. That is, they’d end up paying more (or getting less in refunds) without the expanded child credit, EITC and education credit. 
Romney has not explicitly said he wants those tax cuts to end, but his lack of support for extending them means there would be an increase on the 18 million people. Obama's statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966FEFC0>],/factchecks/2012/may/08/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-would-cut-his-own-taxes-while-ra/
